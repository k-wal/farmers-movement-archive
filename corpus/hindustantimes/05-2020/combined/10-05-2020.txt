Her husband migrated to Kerala and she supports herself and her three small children by working in a weaving shed. Now, there are no orders and she and the children are getting by on one meal a day.Sayidabano stitches garments for a contractor in Ahmedabad and gets paid on a piece-rate basis. Her husband died of tuberculosis five years ago. Her eldest son is 15 years old and she wants to give him an education so that he can earn well and support the family. But now, she has no work and her savings are over. She depends on her neighbours for rations. Multiply these pen portraits of struggle and deprivation a million times, and one gets to see the invisible face of hunger. And that is the face of a woman. The coronavirus disease (Covid-19) lockdown has revealed the precarious lives of a large number of people. Migrants, mostly men in cities, are the visible face of hunger and despair we see every day in the media. The women left behind in the villages, while their menfolk migrate, are equally deprived of food and cash. In normal times, these women continue to work, while the men are away. They look after their own small farms, manage their cattle and other livestock; they are agricultural labourers or small manufacturers doing weaving, garment-making or embroidery; they are domestic servants or provide other services like child care. Then suddenly, abruptly, came the lockdown. And women found themselves without any means of support. The remittances stopped as the migrants grappled with their difficult situations in cities. At the same time, women’s own incomes collapsed. Women who grow vegetables found that they have no way to take them to market; all manufacturing came to a halt, labour was no more in demand; and although the government has mandated the starting of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, this has hardly happened yet anywhere.The slums and mohallas of urban India hide equally hungry women and children. Perhaps the most affected are the women who are the sole earners in their families. These are widows or those whose husbands or fathers cannot earn due to illness, or sometimes due to addictions. They work as domestic help, street vendors, construction labour, ragpickers or engage in small manufacturing in their homes and bring in money to support their children and the elderly in the family. Even in normal times, they are on the edge of survival. Now with their work gone, hunger stalks their homes. Governments have instituted systems by which grains are widely available for families with ration cards. For those without cards, many state governments have systems for filling up documents using the Aadhaar card or other local documents of proof, through which families can access grains. However, a certain percentage, usually the most vulnerable, are outside the zone of this security net. Sometimes, it is due to not having a ration card or even an Aadhaar card; often it is due to the problems in distribution. The central government had announced various cash transfers including ~500 into women’s Jan Dhan accounts. But here too, many fall through the net. In a study done by Dalberg, a global consulting firm, in mid-April among the 18,000 of the poorest, the Indian below poverty line families, it was found that 45% had not received free rations. And over 70% had not received cash payments into their Jan Dhan accounts. This is not all. Other stresses crowd in. Since money is tight, and the period of lockdown uncertain, there are often quarrels in the house about how to budget and on which items. Women usually bear the brunt of these arguments, and face both mental and physical violence. There is, however, a group of invisible people who are ready to reach out to these hungry families. Within every community, there are those who do their best to ensure that others receive food. Many of the volunteers are women like Sarabjit Kaur, a widow who lives in a village in Patiala district with her son. She is primarily a domestic worker, but also cooks for weddings and events and works as agricultural labour to make ends meet. As soon as she heard about the impending lockdown, she identified all vulnerable families in her community immediately and conveyed this information to the local non-governmental organisations and political leaders. These families received ration kits on a priority basis. There are countless such Sarabjit Kaurs throughout the country, and they should be recognised and asked to become part of the government’s distribution system, so that food can reach the last woman.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/women-the-invisible-face-of-hunger/story-8tznm5spx1gElOPP09g11I.html
10-05-2020||News||Plan a fiscal response around State spending||While we continue to debate whether the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) is a black swan or white swan event, there is little doubt that it has exposed how fragile the economic system is. The stress caused by the disruption of global supply lines and the lockdown is expected to take a heavy toll on GDP growth. This could potentially force the world into a prolonged recession. India may have escaped some of the ravages of the virus so far, thanks to early steps taken by the government, including the nationwide lockdown. But it has come at a huge cost to the economy. Tens of millions have lost their jobs, production has come to a halt and the aggregate demand has reached rock-bottom due to the steep fall in exports, investment and consumption demand. This calls for an urgent and unprecedented response from the government. While the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has taken a few welcome steps in this direction, it is doubtful whether the monetary response will be effective in these circumstances. The monetary policy is of little use when interest rates are low, and the economy is operating below full capacity. It also works indirectly via a network of commercial banks by providing interest rate incentives, so that people readjust their portfolios. Today, because of weak animal spirits and low demand, even the lower cost of capital will not induce businesses to borrow or banks to lend. Banks will be unwilling to lend as they are already burdened with high non-performing assets and will be wary of more defaults due to this crisis. And the lower cost of capital or tax cuts by themselves does not stimulate economic activity if ventures are not profitable due to weak demand. Just distributing a small amount of money to a larger number of people will also not stimulate the economy. What we need is a massive fiscal response built around direct State spending. Undertaking a nationwide project of constructing new public health care centres and hospitals will stimulate industrial production, put money in the hands of the people directly involved in the project, in the newly-appointed health workers and doctors and generate consumption expenditure. Even from an equity perspective, with vulnerable sections being disproportionately affected, there is merit in the government undertaking fiscal expansion via activities that directly build social infrastructure. Low inflation and low interest rates weaken the “crowding out” argument. But where will the money come from? It cannot be raised by increasing taxes as businesses are already badly hit by the disruption. Taxing the salaried class will further drain consumer purchasing power. This calls for a large increase in government borrowings including substantial amounts from the RBI at a lower-than-market interest rate. But it appears that the government is facing resistance from the fiscal hawks who are still fixated on the random fiscal deficit target of 3% and is petrified of the rating downgrade by international credit rating agencies (CRAs). The only thing consistent about these CRAs is their failure to accurately assess the financial situation even of individual companies, leave alone countries. They have failed to predict defaults by large companies like DHFL, IL&FS and the Zee group. This patchy track record is not only limited only to India. In the United States, the Enron saga and subsequent congressional hearings revealed that Standard & Poor’s (S&P) had reaffirmed investment-grade status for the company in October 2001, then downgraded it in November 2001 four days before it declared bankruptcy. Dubious ratings by CRAs played a key role in incubating the 2008 financial crisis. Back then, questions were raised about the role of CRAs in giving bundles of mortgage-backed securities, which had toxic underlying assets, AAA ratings. The methodology of CRAs is opaque, questionable and often lacks economic logic. Take China and India. In 2016, India’s rating by S&P was stuck at BBB — despite improvement in growth and macroeconomic stability since 2014, while China’s rating was unchanged at AAA  despite historic credit expansion and a fall in GDP growth. Most of the toolkits that CRAs use do not factor in uncertainty. Since the 1970s, CRAs have worked with the “issuer pay model”, where the issuer of any market instrument pays to get itself rated leading to an inherent conflict of interest. Competition among them and the client’s desire for better ratings often lead to inflated ratings. Also, the de facto licensing power implies that CRAs obtain a rent to allow borrowers to access debt markets rather than award the certification after due diligence on borrower quality as envisaged in regulation. At this juncture, there can hardly be anything worse than making economic policy subservient to international CRAs. Instead of trying to focus on speculative financial flows, the State must fulfil its obligation under its social contract. If the State does not step up to the plate during a pandemic, the battle against the virus cannot be won.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/plan-a-fiscal-response-around-state-spending/story-HAl2OI5sKbIEV4RxqqabJP.html

We will bring the matter to the notice of senior police officials,” he added. SHO Sharma said the function was organised to distribute free ration to the needy. Whether he took permission for organising the event from the administration, he said, “I had informed my senior officials about it. Social distancing norms were followed.”ACP Narinder Singh claimed, “I repeatedly appealed to people for maintaining social distancing,” he said.Amritsar police commissioner Sukhchain Singh said he was not aware of the matter. “I will look into it,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/religious-event-held-at-amritsar-police-station-social-distancing-goes-for-a-toss/story-NawAmdr4D799GusISEg2wK.html
10-05-2020||Delhi||North Delhi Municipal Corporation teacher who died last week had Covid-19||A 45-year-old employee of the North Delhi Municipal Corporation who died last week has tested positive for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), the civic body said on Sunday. Her husband had died of the disease on May 3 — a day before her. Both were being treated in Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital. Her first Covid-19 test had returned negative, north corporation officials said, without giving out any further details.The woman was a teacher employed with the north corporation. Spokesperson of the civic body, Ira Singhal, said, “We have passed the file requesting compensation for the teacher.” She was engaged in food distribution at her school in Jahangirpuri and therefore entitled to ₹1 crore compensation announced by the Delhi government for those working on the front line against Covid-19, municipal officers said.Corporation officials said she had stopped coming to the school due to ill-health at least 18 days before her death and so staff members associated with her didn’t need to be quarantined. “She had last come to work on April 18. Her next duty was on 25th, which she did not attend,” Singhal said.They are survived by two sons. The north corporation also said that one of its malaria inspectors in the Karol Bagh zone has reported Covid-positive. “He was taken to Lok Nayak Hospital on Friday and discharged after a preliminary check-up, and advised to isolate at home. At least 19 of his contacts have been traced, and all of them have been advised home quarantine. The Karol Bagh office where he worked has been sanitised,” Singhal said.So far, 16 health care workers working in three of the north corporation’s biggest hospitals — Hindu Rao, Kasturba and RBTB — have contracted Covid-19 and are under treatment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/north-delhi-municipal-corporation-teacher-who-died-last-week-had-covid-19/story-F8P2MmSEf0TBSPd97dnggL.html
10-05-2020||City||Brought on production warrant from Amritsar jail, undertrial tests positive||An undertrial of the Amritsar Central Jail, which is packed with around 3,000 inmates, has tested positive for coronavirus after being brought by the police on production warrant.Partap Singh, who had been lodged in the jail in a robbery case registered against him in Tarn Taran district, was brought on production warrant by Chatiwind police for questioning in a murder case on May 6. According to the jail authorities, he had been living with around 200 inmates in a barrack of the jail. Chatiwind police station SHO Suhail Qasim Mir said, “Partap tested positive for coronavirus on Saturday. He is now admitted to Guru Nanak Dev hospital here.”After coming out of the jail, Partap came into the contact of around 24 people, including two judges and four policemen. ADGP (jails) Praveen Sinha said, “This is the first Covid-19 positive jail inmate in the state that had been living in a jail for a long time. Earlier, three cases had surfaced but these inmates were those who were sent to the jails after being arrested by the police recently.”Earlier this week, Jaggu Bhagwanpuria, a dreaded gangster, had tested positive for the contagious disease in Gurdaspur, but his second and third reports were found negative. He was brought on production warrant by Batala police from the Patiala jail.Meanwhile, Punjab jail minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa was not available for his comments despite HT’s repeated phone calls. Chatiwind police station SHO Suhail Qasim Mir said, “Four policemen had come into Partap’s contact. They have been isolated. As Partap is asymptomatic, we have requested the health department to go in for his retesting.”Partap was also produced in local courts twice — on May 6 when he was brought from the jail and later on May 8. According to a letter issued by a chief judicial magistrate (CJM), Amritsar, the copy of which is with HT, as many as 20 persons, including two judicial magistrates of first class (JMIC) and lawyers, had come into Partap’s contact during the hearing. Amritsar civil surgeon Dr Jugal Kishore said they have taken the samples of the two JMICs for testing and other persons have been called for testing on Monday. He said, “The doctors deployed in the jail have been directed to screen all those inmates who had come into the accused’s contact. After their screening, all the inmates will be quarantined for 15 days.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/brought-on-production-warrant-from-amritsar-jail-undertrial-tests-positive/story-Iswz35HO0jAf0RiMxzGFlO.html
10-05-2020||City||Covid-19: Implement new discharge policy to reduce load on hospitals: Docs to govt||The Punjab government should implement the new discharge policy for the coronavirus patients as proposed by the Union health ministry to reduce unnecessary load on Covid hospitals, doctors in Amritsar said on Sunday.The doctors believe that asymptomatic patients can be home quarantined for 14 days or can be isolated in Covid-19 care centres so that they can focus on severe cases in hospitals.As per the revised policy, mild, very mild and pre-symptomatic patients admitted to a Covid care facility will undergo regular temperature and pulse monitoring. They can be discharged from hospital after 10 days of symptom onset and if they have no fever for 3 days, it says. There will be no need for testing before discharge. At the time of discharge, the patient will be advised to follow home isolation for 7 more days.“Since hospitals are jam-packed with Covid-19 patients, most of whom are asymptomatic, the doctors are facing a difficult time to concentrate on severe patients. The asymptomatic patients are not being given any treatment in the hospital because they are healthy,” said Dr Shiv Charan, head of medicine department at Government Medical College and hospital (GMCH), Amritsar.“The government should admit only those Covid-19 patients in the hospital who are severely infected and have co-morbidities,” Dr AP Singh, dean, Sri Guru Ram Das (SGRD) University of Health Sciences.State health department spokesperson for Covid-19, Dr Rajesh Bhaskar, he said, “Punjab government is conducting meeting with union ministry about the new discharge policy. It will take two to three days to decide upon its implementation in the state.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-implement-new-discharge-policy-to-reduce-load-on-hospitals-docs-to-govt/story-983bvTbHlW4ZhdFwGoSMRN.html

Following Singh’s intervention, the hostel authority on Sunday said it has allowed the students to stay back.The residents of DU’s North Eastern Students House for Women were on Friday asked by the hostel administration to vacate their rooms at the earliest, citing the fact that their contact with the mess will get expired by the end of this month. While other residents of the hostel had managed to leave for their homes before the nationwide lockdown was announced on March 25, these 13 students had got stuck and are were staying in the hostel.The hostellers on Saturday had written to the minister seeking his help. On Sunday, Singh contacted the administration and tweeted about it saying, “Students from #Northeast in Delhi University hostel, please note. The issue that arose last night as a result of eviction notice to some of you to leave the hostel, has been sorted out. You can continue to stay where you are, comfortably and safely. Have spoken to VC #DU Prof YogeshTyagi.”Hostel provost Rita Singh also sent a mail to the students allowing them to stay back. “Please do not worry, we will help you in safe stay here till you decide to leave in a safe environment. We will try our best to provide you basic mess facility,” she said.The provost in her email said that one of their guards was sent for self-quarantine on Saturday after someone tested positive of Covid-19 in his locality. “We are worried about three other guards who are staying in the same area or colony. We have asked two gardeners to do guard duties. We are worried about your safety and security,” she added.The hostellers, on their part, appreciated Union minister Singh’s intervention. “It will be easier for us to stay in the hostel amid the lockdown,” said a resident. Hostel provost Singh did not respond to calls and messages for a comment on Sunday.Delhi University administration also issued a statement saying, “The residents of northeastern students’ house for women have been contacted and assured that the university is with them in the testing time. They are safe and secure in the hostel premises.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/du-hostel-asks-13-students-to-vacate-hostel-backtracks-after-union-minister-intervenes/story-LVyclyotvw9xiYHwZCBUBL.html
10-05-2020||Chandigarh||Ministers to seek explanation from officers for liquor revenue shortfall||A day after Punjab ministers and state’s top officers, including chief secretary Karan Avtar Singh, indulged in a showdown over excise policy in a pre-cabinet meet on Saturday, the ministers have decided to seek an explanation from excise officials for revenue shortfall. The issue will be raised with chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh at a cabinet meeting on Monday. This meeting had been deferred after Saturday’s face-off. The department is under the CM.There was a revenue shortfall of around Rs 1,000 crore at the end of 2018-19 fiscal. Last fiscal that ended on March 31, the shortfall was around Rs 650 crore.HT has learnt that the ministers would also oppose compensating liquor contractors for the lockdown, imposed from March 23, with vends remaining shut for 45 days, nine in 2019-20 and 36 this fiscal.“There is no justification to extend the current financial year into 2021-22 as it would spoil the entire revenue generation calendar. The idea of compensating contractors by giving them more time in the next year is not good,” said technical education minister Charanjeet Singh Channi.Finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal has also opposed this proposal. The department has also proposed to compensate contractors by reducing revenue targets by 10%, in proportion with the 36 days lost this fiscal. This will mean the state foregoing Rs 620 crore, as the annual target for this year was Rs 6,200 crore.“The loss this year, however, is huge. Of 750 liquor groups opened for sale, only 500 were sold, with the rest 30% unsold. Who will compensate for this loss which runs into Rs 2,000 crore,” questioned Channi. “The excise department wants the cabinet to give clearance to compensate contractors for 45 days. Why were the stocks not sealed when lockdown was imposed on March 23? Now, the department doesn’t talk of the stock audit. There are the reports that contractors have liquidated their stocks during the lockdown,” said cooperation minister Sukhjinder Singh Radhawa. “No one questions officers, revenue in other states is picking up and we are sliding down,” said Randhawa. Ministers want chiefsecretary to apologiseThe ministers have taken a serious view of chief secretary’s comments on Saturday and would seek an apology from him. He did not initially come for face-to-face meeting, and he turned up for it on the insistence of ministers. The ministers have also objected to this. “This shows he’s very arrogant and wants to prevail upon elected representatives. We want him to tender an apology,” said a minister.********************Strap/BlurbPunjab CM to chair cabinet meeting today after a show-off between ministers and state chief secy led to its deferment on Saturday; ministers also question proposals to compensate liquor contractors for losses incurred during the lockdown&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&QuoteOf 750 liquor groups opened for sale, only 500 were sold this year, with the rest 30% unsold.

10-05-2020||City||Punjab’s excise revenue growth from liquor has dipped under Cong||Patiala Even as Punjab’s politicians and bureaucrats are engaged in a turf battle over excise policy for liquor amid the pandemic, an analysis of data shows its increase in revenue from the trade (in terms of percentage) has dipped over the past two fiscal years. The period corresponds with the Congress taking charge of the government in March 2017. The state registered negative growth in excise revenue for fiscal 2018-19, collecting Rs 5,072 crore, against Rs 5,135 crore in 2017-18. For the fiscal-ended March 31, there has been a slight increase (2.5%) in revenue over the past year at Rs 5,200 crore. The figure of Rs 5,200 crore, however, is a whopping Rs 1,000 crore short of its target of Rs 6,201 crore that the state had set in the budget. The excise revenue from liquor was clocked at Rs 5,135 crore for 2017-18, against target of Rs 5,422 crore. Revenue dipped to Rs 5,072 crore in 2018-19, before dipping to Rs 5,200 crore (not the final figure) last fiscal that ended on March 31 this year. The state’s Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) has listed out the data in its accounting reports. Even though the actual target were also not met in SAD-BJP regime, but there was significant growth of revenue.Some of the reasons for the dipping revenue are flawed policy, poor implementation and interference of politician-contractor nexus, sources said. Politicians never ask for actual realised revenue, ensuring that some in the officialdom take them for a ride, they claim.Contrary to negative cumulative excise revenue growth under the Congress, the SAD-BJP had recorded 46% growth cumulatively. Under them, from a base of Rs 3,000 crore in 2012, the revenue collection rose to Rs 4,796 crore in 2015-16.A state government official admitted, on condition of anonymity, “Even though the actual target was not even met in SAD-BJP regime, but there was a significant growth of revenue. They almost jacked up revenue from Rs 1,800 crore in four years of SAD-BJP regime. However, now either there is no growth, or negative growth. We are falling short of targeted revenue in budget by 15%.” Admitting that revenue collection had dipped and growth had halted, an official said, “We usually see a dip in revenue in an assembly election year. However, a dip every year is a cause for concern.”He claimed contractors had been able to manipulate policy, with liquor sold in large quantity in the state even during curfew and lockdown, and on top of that there was demand for relaxation. The official added, “The government needs to seal all liquor godowns and conduct a physical verification of stock. It must also be probed that how is an illegal distillery functioning in Khanna.”Punjab chief secretary Karan Avtar Singh, who holds the charge of excise and taxation department, could not be contacted for comments. Excise and taxation commissioner Vivek Partap Singh did not respond to repeated calls on his phone.***********************STRAP/BLURB Targeted revenue has also not been achieved, with just a slight increase in collection seen for the fiscal that has just ended, an analysis of CAG reports showGRAPHIC WITH RAVI PLEASE||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-s-excise-revenue-growth-from-liquor-has-dipped-under-cong/story-AhwBWfPFv45gsyVAlMAOrK.html
10-05-2020||Mumbai||Focus on contact-tracing, better coordination: BMC chief to Covid task force||After two back-to-back review meetings on Saturday and Sunday with the Covid-19 task force in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) comprising top bureaucrats, senior most municipal officials, and assistant commissioners of wards, Mumbai’s new civic commissioner IS Chahal outlined a strategy to battle Covid-19 in the city which includes enhanced contact-tracing efforts, decentralisation of work to administrative wards, careful identification of high-risk contacts, better inter-ward coordination, and optimal usage of beds.A civic official said, “Two review meetings with similar agendas were conducted on Saturday and Sunday. All civic officials and top bureaucrats working on Covid-19 were divided in two groups for the meeting to maintain social distancing norms. Twelve ward officers attended the first meeting, and the remaining 12 attended the second meeting.”Chahal has asked the administration to increase the average number of contacts traced for each Covid-19 positive person to six people, from the present average of 3 people. Once these contacts are identified, they are to be moved to institutional quarantine facilities immediately and are to be closely monitored over 14 days, which is the number of days for incubation period of the virus according to the present official protocol. Chahal also asked officials to channel maximum efforts toward tracing high-risk contacts of positive patients. Saying that each assistant commissioner is equivalent to the municipal commissioner in their respective ward, the BMC chief said they have complete responsibility of all developments and activities in their respective wards. Assistant commissioners are tasked with delegating dedicated responsibility to ward staffers and ensuring the delegated work is done as per schedule. They have also been asked to conduct periodic review meetings with staff members at their ward, equivalent to the municipal commissioner’s review meetings for the entire city. The officials present in the meeting were told to “be aware of even the minute details of Covid-19 related developments and trends in your ward”, according to one official.After BMC earned flak for the incident at Sion hospital, wherein a video showing bodies of dead patients wrapped in black body bags were seen lying on beds alongside patients went viral on social media, Chahal told all assistant commissioners that the sole responsibility of everything that goes on in the hospitals under a ward’s jurisdiction lies with the respective assistant commissioner. The assistant commissioners have also been asked to look at bed management and ensuring availability of beds at each hospital.Regarding containment zones, Chahal has ordered result oriented management in each containment zone with fever camps and strict lockdown protocol. Each containment zone will get a ‘Covid warrior’ for better management of activities, including essential supplies. Local elected representatives will also be roped in for help.For inter-ward coordination, Chahal is known to have told assistant commissioners of wards, which are witnessing over-burdened usage of beds, to coordinate with wards where beds are available for better management. The city will also get new ambulances as BMC plans to give each of the 100 Covid centres in the city two ambulances each. All 24 wards will be individually reviewed by the new municipal commissioner in the upcoming week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/focus-on-contact-tracing-better-coordination-bmc-chief-to-covid-task-force/story-y3fZZFzUBtBVHZcyCGCQ5N.html

Two university guards are also accompanying students in the bus. These students were stranded in hostels due to sudden lockdown and could not go to their homes,” said Jamia media coordinator Ahmed Azeem in the statement.The bus was sanitised before it left the campus and thermal screening of thr students and staff members were done. “The students were provided with water, food packets, hand sanitiser and masks,” he added.The University had last week asked students stranded in the hostels to vacate rooms and leave for their homes, saying several areas near the campus had been declared Covid-19 hot spots. The University has already announced its revised academic calender according to which it will reopen only in August. The university is now making travel arrangements for the students of other states including Jharkhand, Bihar and Rajasthan and West Bengal. “We are in touch with the governments of all these states to decide how to send the students back to their homes,” Azeem said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/jamia-millia-islamia-sends-22-students-back-to-kashmir/story-Ch4fokypD7tlxzufas0L3J.html
10-05-2020||Mumbai||Need more testing: Scientists on social media||Scientists and researchers from prominent institutes flooded social media websites on Saturday with videos and posters demanding that more Covid-19 detections be conducted and better protective gears be given to frontline workers. This comes three weeks after state chapters of the India March for Science (IMFS) – an informal association of people from the scientific and academic community advocating increase in funding for research and scientific temper – wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In their letter dated April 19, the scientific community made eight demands and suggestions for strengthening India’s battle against the Covid-19 pandemic. Apart from asking for better protective gear for frontline workers and an increase in number of tests, scientists have suggested that science graduates be recruited for the job of exhaustive contact-tracing.On Saturday, IMFS launched a social media initiative to further emphasise their demands and suggestions. Eminent scientists from organisations such as the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research (IISER), and Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) have posted short videos on social media sites reiterating these demands. “We have written to the Prime Minister, but there has been no response yet. However, some state governments are paying heed to our suggestions. Through this social media initiative we want to increase our reach and let people know of our demands and suggestions,” said Soumitro Banerjee, a professor from IISER Kolkata. As part of their suggestions, the scientists have offered their laboratories to state governments for Covid-19 testing. “Institutes, which have BSL2 (biosafety level-2) facilities, can get Covid-19 tests done if they have a real time reverse transcription – polymerase chain reaction (real time RT-PCR) machine. These machines can detect the virus from the RNA samples extracted from the patient’s swabs,” Banerjee explained. He said the West Bengal government has written to IISER Kolkata to use the RT-PCR facility for testing. “We are awaiting a nod from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) for the same,” he added.The scientists have also demanded an increase in funding for research in medical sciences.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/need-more-testing-scientists-on-social-media/story-MuaqKWnQOQ4jVeCXNErmSO.html

10-05-2020||City||Coronavirus lockdown: Poor internet connectivity, limited resources not a deterrent for these ITI students||Where there’s a will, there’s a way. Many industrial training institute (ITI) students across Punjab, who are residing in villages and facing connectivity issues in attending online classes, are exemplifying this proverb as they are taking the lectures while sitting on rooftops, under water tanks and even in fields. The online classes have been a big hit among these students. Majority of them said that earlier, they used to spend a lot of time on social networking sites, but now they make use of the technology to either study online or watch course-related videos.A student, Gurveer Singh, who is pursuing welder trade course from ITI, Gill Road, Ludhiana, said, “Earlier I was facing many connectivity issues in attending online classes. To resolve this problem, I was asked by my parents to check the connectivity at the rooftop and when I went there, I was able to join the lectures without any hassle.” “During free hours, I help my parents in the household chores, but at 10am sharp, I reach the rooftop of my house to attend online classes. I have told my friends residing in the neighbourhood to call me up only after 5pm as the internet gets interrupted if someone call up in between the online lectures,” the 21-year-old student said. ‘POOR CONNECTIVITY A HINDRANCE’Sandeep Kaur, who hails from Teja Kalan village, Fatehgarh, said, “I never miss online classes, but due to poor connectivity issues, the mobile internet gets disconnected several times while attending the lectures. I attend the classes atop the roof of my house by sitting under the water tank because the lectures begin at 11am and by that time of the day, it becomes very hot.” “But as I am very fond of this course, I have decided to sit on a brick under the water tank and attend the classes,” said Sandeep, adding that she is pursuing embroidery course from ITI, Fatehgarh Churian. Nowadays, she is stitching a kurta pyjama for a 10-year-old and will embed embroidery as part of an assignment given to her by her instructors. Lovepreet Singh, another ITI student, who hails from Barwali village, Mansa, said, “Due to the peak season of rabi harvesting last month, I helped my father and spent the entire day at the grain market daily. I do not want to miss my online classes, so, I used my phone for the same while taking care of the grains at the market.” Lovepreet is pursuing wireman trade from government ITI, Bathinda. The 19-year-old students said, “I joined this course this year as I enjoy attending online classes. I always read the material send by our instructors a day before the scheduled lectures so that I can have a better understanding while attending the classes online.”The directorate of technical education and industrial training, Punjab, started the online teaching process on April 14 with an aim to sustain the teaching learning process throughout the lockdown. The online classes are conducted for all 44 trades and the most popular among students are -- electrician, welder, fitter, turner, machinist motor mechanic, diesel mechanic, plumber, sewing technology, surface ornamentation and cosmology. ‘STUDY MATERIAL SENT VIA WHATSAPP’Additional director Daljit Kaur Sidhu said, “The e-learning material is sent to the trainees one day before the scheduled lectures via WhatsApp and the next day, the instructors take online classes of 40-60 minutes and give assignments to the trainees. The instructors also conduct a test every weekend to know the effectiveness of online classes.”For proper coordination of online classes, assistant director RP Singh, principal of ITI, Ludhiana, Baljinder Singh, and principal of ITI, Patiala, Varinder Bansal, send the trade-wise material to all heads of the institutes and supervise the online data.Principal secretary (technical education and industrial training), Punjab, Anurag Verma, said, “We started these online classes to engage students, otherwise, they would have missed the course. I must appreciate the team members, including ITI principals and teachers, who worked hard to prepare the online content.” “Now, the classes are running smoothly. At times, I also attend classes and take feedback from the students,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/coronavirus-lockdown-poor-internet-connectivity-limited-resources-not-a-deterrent-for-these-iti-students/story-UDas4RbVgD7F0JqDZ1ARjI.html
10-05-2020||Mumbai||First Covid case in Byculla women’s jail||The Byculla women’s prison reported its first Covid-19 case with a 54-year-old inmate testing positive on Sunday. This is the second jail in the city to get infected after 103 people – 77 inmates and 26 staffers – at Arthur Road jail tested positive on May 7. A jail official said a doctor attached with the jail had tested positive a few days ago, but added that the doctor was on leave for more than two weeks and was at home when his reports came positive. According to the official, the prisoner was arrested by Kharghar police in a cheating case in 2017 and has not secured bail till now. It is still not certain how the woman contracted the virus. The woman fell sick on May 7 and was referred to JJ Hospital as her oxygen saturation level had fallen below 90%. Her first Covid test came negative on May 8, but as her condition did not improve, a second test was conducted on May 9 and it came positive. “The inmate was then shifted to St George Hospital where she is currently undergoing treatment” said Deepak Pandey, inspector general of police (prison).The prison houses several high profile inmates including Sheena Bora murder accused Indrani Bora, activists Sudha Bharadwaj and Shoma Sen who were arrested by Pune Police in 2018 for their alleged connection to the Elgar Parishad case. Byculla women’s prison is the only jail for women inmates in the city and also has a male barrack.“Byculla jail originally had a capacity of 262 inmates, but after construction of new barracks inside the jail, it has increased to 400 inmates. Currently, there are 325 inmates lodged in Byculla jail,” said a jail official.Last week, 276 people were tested in Arthur Road jail, of whom 103 people – 77 inmates and 26 jail staffers – tested positive for Covid-19. A jail official said, “All 77 inmates have been shifted to a quarantine facility in Mahul near Chembur under proper police protection.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/first-covid-case-in-byculla-women-s-jail/story-oyj3LzUZufwbfQ7W9b1LPM.html
10-05-2020||Delhi||Delhi University mulls over open-book, online exams, passing 1st, 2nd yr students based on previous evaluations||The Delhi University (DU) is thinking about conducting exams only for final-year students while promoting first and second-year students on the basis of the scores of their internal assessments and previous semester’s exams, persons familiar with developments said, adding that the varsity’s examination committee has proposed to conduct final-year exams through the open-book, online process.The proposal, however, was criticised by several faculty members and students.According to officials, who asked to not be named, the newly-formed working committee on examinations, in a meeting Friday, discussed options for conducting exams amid the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic. The university had in March cancelled exams till further notice in view of the nationwide lockdown, imposed to curb the spread of the disease.A member of the committee said that online open exams are under consideration. “The university is considering several options for conducting exams of third-year students. It will not be feasible to conduct exams for all students in DU in the present scenario. We have around 9,00,000 students, including those in the school of open learning (SOL) and non-collegiate women’s education board (NCWEB). Of these, over two lakh are in the final year and they are the priority now as they would need their results for admission to Master’s courses or for jobs. We are considering holding exams for only third-year students in the online mode,” the member said, requesting anonymity.The University Grants Commission (UGC), in its recommendation to universities, had suggested that educational institutions may promote intermediate-year students on the basis of their internal exams and last semester’s exam scores.Explaining the open-book format, an official, who asked not to be identified, said that the students can be allowed to use books or notes during the open book exams. “In such exams, students are evaluated on the basis of their understanding of concepts. We are yet to take a final call on this,” the member cited above said.While other central universities in Delhi -- Jawaharlal Nehru University and Jamia Millia Islamia -- have already announced their revised academic calendars with details of examinations and admission, DU is yet to come up with a mechanism. The varsity has formed several committees to take a call on the matter. DU’s dean of students Rajeev Gupta said, “The structure of DU is very different and it will take us some time to decide on how to conduct exams for so many students. Besides colleges and departments, we have SOL and NCWEB as well.”A group of teachers on Sunday wrote to DU vice-chancellor Yogesh Tyagi opposing the proposal. “In the present situation, both the students and the teachers are struggling. The students are already stressed with online classes. This would add unnecessary pressure on them. The open-book, online exams need a totally different-patterned question paper. Neither students nor teachers have been trained for this process of conducting exams at our university,” said Pankaj Garg, one of the teachers who wrote to the VC, in his letter.The teachers suggested that the final year students should also be promoted based on the UGC recommendation. Meanwhile, a section of teachers suggested that exams should be conducted only after the situation becomes normal. “A big chunk of our students are from rural parts of the country; they do not have proper access to the internet. So any kind of online exams is not feasible for them. And it will be unfair for the first and second-year students if we do not conduct their exams. It is better that the university holds exams in a traditional manner only after the situation becomes normal,” said Rajesh Jha, a member of DU’s academic council.Despite several attempts, the varsity’s vice-chancellor did not respond to calls and texts for a comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/du-mulls-over-open-book-online-exams-passing-1st-2nd-yr-students-based-on-previous-evaluations/story-SFgyX4DBJzEE6aFKNwjQ3N.html
10-05-2020||Mumbai||20% of city’s Covid cases reported in Kurla, Byculla, Andheri West||After G South (Worli) and G North (Dharavi) wards, three other administrative wards in the city have witnessed a sharp rise in the number of Covid-19 cases, with the count in each ward inching closer towards the 1000-case mark. Among the 24 administrative wards in Mumbai, those including areas of Kurla, Byculla, and Andheri (West) account for 20% of the total cases in Mumbai. While the city’s count reached 12,689 as on Saturday, the cases in these three wards tallied up to 2,544.The E ward (Byculla-Mumbai Central) has reported a total of 945 cases and 77 deaths; L ward (Kurla-Sakinaka) has 807 cases and 61 deaths so far; K West ward, which covers Andheri West, Versova, Irla, Juhu, Oshiwara and parts of Jogeshwari, has reported 792 cases and 30 deaths in total.These wards, which have dense slum populations, old buildings, and congested chawls, are likely to have witnessed a spike in the number of cases on Sunday as the city recorded 875 new Covid-19 cases, taking the total count to 13,564. The ward-wise break up of cases for Sunday is yet to be released.The city also recorded 19 more deaths, crossing the 500-fatality mark. So far, the city has lost 508 people to the novel coronavirus.E ward, covering areas like Madanpura, Mazagaon, and Nagpada, has a significant number of Mhada-owned cess buildings and several congested chawls. The number of cases in this ward jumped from 466 on April 25 (the last time BMC released ward-wise data) to 945 on May 10. Civic officials said that on average, 30-32 cases are reported in the ward daily. Prashant Gaikwad, assistant municipal commissioner of E ward (additional charge), said, “We have intensified lockdown measures, are conducting fever screening in door-to-door surveys and increased the testing capacity because of which more cases are being found. The number of cases in the ward is reaching its peak and shortly, it will stabilise and start decrea.”However, local representatives say that the ward is being neglected by the authorities. Rais Shaikh, MLA from Bhiwandi and a corporator from Madanpura in Byculla, said, “It is utter chaos due to administrative mismanagement. The civic body is falling short on proper contact tracing and is responding slowly to symptomatic patients found in the ward. There have been cases where positive patients have not been isolated for days. This is a serious lapse and the authorities are not as bothered about the cases here as they are concerned for VIP areas.”K West and L wards, which comprise dense slum pockets and congested areas, are also reporting a rise in the number of cases. Ranjeet Dhakane, deputy municipal commissioner of K West ward, said, “We are identifying symptomatic and suspected cases in slums and shifting them to quarantine centres as much as possible. We have formed teams of BMC officials, police, local representatives, and NGO workers, and deployed them in containment zones for strict observation of social distancing.”Civic officials from these wards say that attempting to maintain social distancing in slum pockets is difficult. In the L ward, for instance, nearly 70% of its cases are from slum areas, an official confirmed. “The ward also has a significant number of migrant workers as several small-scale industries are housed here. We are providing food packets in these areas but the workers have no option but to step out to collect food. However, more than 400 health camps have been set up in the areas so far and fever screening is being conducted,” the official said.Cases in the neighbouring wards of G south (Worli) and G North (Dharavi) have crossed the 1000-mark already. Dharavi has reported 1,087 cases and over 1,000 have tested positive in G South. Sharad Ughade, assistant municipal commissioner of G South ward, was unavailable for comment.Meanwhile, of the 875 cases reported on Sunday, 197 had tested positive on May 7 and 8 but were added to the tally later. Of 19 deaths (10 men, 9 women) reported on Sunday, 13 patients had co-morbidities. One victim was below 40 years and five others were above 60 years; the remaining 13 victims were aged between 40 and 60 years. BMC quarantines 331 Indians returning from London, SingaporeIndian nationals who landed in the city via two special flights on Saturday night and Sunday morning were quarantined at various hotels by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC).Of the 337 passengers who landed from London, 248 are from Mumbai, along with 53 from the Singapore flight. They will be quarantined for 14 days before they are allowed to go home. Another 33 travellers from the Singapore flight are from out of Maharashtra and have not received onward passes to travel home. They have been quarantined in Mumbai and if any of these passengers develop symptoms, they will be tested on the seventh or eighth day of their quarantine.Passengers are paying between ₹1,500 and ₹4,500 per day for accommodation based on their choice of hotel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/20-of-city-s-covid-cases-reported-in-kurla-byculla-andheri-west/story-MQJbfeSQUBJEQh5ETM3lIL.html

10-05-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh’s GMCH-32 to test all patients for Covid-19||The Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) in Sector 32 will be testing all patients for Covid-19 as a precautionary measure to ensure its staffers don’t pick up the infection.The move follows an in-house committee’s recommendation to test all patients after a 30-year-old operation theatre assistant from Bapu Dham Colony tested positive on April 24, following which nine other healthcare workers were infected and more than 150 other such workers were quarantined. The committee said all patients admitted to medicine emergency will be tested according to government guidelines. This includes patients being admitted to departments of psychiatry, obstetrics and gynaecology for childbirth and surgery and others requiring angioplasty or endoscopy.“The hospital administration has accepted the recommendations to save healthcare workers from infections. This also includes patients who are brought by the police and their background is not known,” said Dr BS Chavan, director-cum-principal, GMCH-32. With the implementation of the new hospital guidelines, sampling is also expected to increase significantly, for which the panel has stressed on the requirement of automatic extraction machines. The manual sample extraction process followed currently is cumbersome and automatic machines can remain in use even after routine medical services resume, it said. The brief standard operating procedure prepared by the panel states that the condition of the patients will be assessed in the emergency following which they can be tested.Another panel will now be coordinating the testing process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-s-gmch-32-to-test-all-patients-for-covid-19/story-m2Nb4HrTtg3IcHmk2A0qSO.html
10-05-2020||Mumbai||‘CT scan of chest mandatory for Covid patients before discharge’||Following the footsteps of China, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has made chest CT scans compulsory for Covid-19 patients during discharge, for better identification of any presence of the novel coronavirus in the body. Though CT scan is more expensive and also exposes patients to a low dose of radiation, it became popular among Chinese doctors in quickly identifying cases. The technology helps in identifying borderline suspicious cases, asymptomatic patients along with Covid-positive people, whose swab test reports came negative, said radiologists.“The CT scan can help identify small, patchy translucent white areas in the lungs that we call ‘ground glass opacities’. These cotton-like spots are indicators of the presence of Sars-Cov-2,” said Dr Natasha Nanda, a radiologist from Dr LH Hiranandani Hospital.The same observations have been made in the civic-run BYL Nair Hospital. Following which, BMC made changes in their discharge protocols. “According to experts, these scans help in ascertaining Covid-19 cases better. Thus, we decided to add this new rule of compulsory CT scan of recovered patients during discharge,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner (health), BMC.In a recent study— ‘Correlation of Chest CT and RT-PCR Testing in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China’ published in journal— Radiology, stated that chest CT scan found 97% of Covid-19 infections. The study conducted among 1,014 patients in China also revealed that 48% of patients who had negative results on the swab test, actually still had the disease.Dr Nanda added, “It is important to do a CT scan on the patient before discharge even though the swab test is negative. If a doctor finds any white spots, it means that the virus is still active.”Many radiologists and epidemiologists also stated that the CT scan is safer for medical staff than collecting swab samples from suspected patients. “Collecting the swab can trigger coughing, making the technician or nurse more vulnerable to acquiring the infection. A CT scan is safer but it requires proper sanitation after each patient’s scanning,” said a radiologist from Nair Hospital. In China, considering the success rate of these scans in early and more evident findings, all fever clinics installed the machines. “For aggressive disease identification, we need to involve both swab tests and CT scans to ensure the highest authenticity,” said Dr Om Srivastava, a city-based epidemiologist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ct-scan-of-chest-mandatory-for-covid-patients-before-discharge/story-Wm5bOAfLV8ALVYZU40buKK.html

In a statement, SAD spokesman Daljit Singh Cheema said, “It was unfortunate when every state was doing its utmost to combat COVID-19, the Punjab cabinet was fighting with bureaucrats as witnessed in yesterday’s pre-cabinet meeting.”He said, “With the cabinet not trusting the bureaucrats and vice versa, there is a leadership crisis due to which Punjab and Punjabis are suffering. The Punjab government should stop questioning the Union government everyday to divert attention from its failures and tell the people why its leaders and their friends were allowed to loot the state exchequer.” Meanwhile, former deputy speaker of Punjab assembly Bir Devinder Singh also said that “sordid developments that emerged from the pre-cabinet meeting” has pushed the state into a constitutional crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sad-seeks-cbi-probe-in-illicit-liquor-sale-scam-in-punjab/story-mby6kKF44i229gBqXHOgMP.html

The police said the victim’s biological brother, a complainant in the case, had alleged that the victim had written on her body that she was leaving behind a suicide note in her room. However, the police said that the alleged note could not be recovered from the spot. According to the police, the victim, who was pursuing a post-graduate degree through distance learning, was found hanging at her house on May 2 around 10.45am. No suicide note was recovered at the time of the incident and the police had initiated inquest proceedings. The victim’s brother and her father, who is a police official with the government railway police, had gone for work at the time of the incident. A police official privy to the investigation, requesting anonymity, said that the victim’s brother filed a police complaint on Saturday, alleging that his stepmother and his stepbrother had been harassing his sister for several years. In the complaint, the victim’s brother alleged that she was assaulted and harassed, which provoked her to commit suicide. “Our stepmother often reprimanded my sister, imposed restrictions on her and made her feel inferior. My sister had been upset for the past few months due to frequent altercations with my stepbrother and stepmother. She had confided to a relative that she was extremely upset. A night prior to her death, my stepmother had scolded her after an argument,” the victim’s brother stated in the complaint.He also alleged that his sister had written on her hand that she was leaving behind a suicide note in her closet. “I suspect that my stepmother and stepbrother have hidden the suicide note since they were the first to discover her dead body,” he alleged. The police said they were verifying the allegations mentioned in the complaint. Rajender Kumar, station house officer (SHO), Palam Vihar police station, said, “The suicide note is yet to be recovered. We are verifying the allegations and have initiated the probe. No arrests have been made so far,” said SHO. A case was registered against the accused under sections 306 (abetment of suicide) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code(IPC) at Palam Vihar police station, said the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/woman-commits-suicide-stepmother-and-stepbrother-booked-for-abetment/story-Zg6d86TdwLyCNIlqO8OfVJ.html

Since when all this has been going on, with whose backing, from where the liquor was coming, how much excise theft took place as liquor from other states was also found, who all officials are involved, all this needs an in-depth probe,” said Vij.This is why I have recommended a senior IAS officer to head the SIT to probe the case, the minister reasoned.Vij said he has already recommended to the chief minister that the three-member SIT should be headed by a senior IAS officer for a thorough probe looking into all possible angles involved in the case.Vij has given names of senior IAS officers Ashok Khemka, Sanjeev Kaushal and TC Gupta, requesting CM Khattar to pick up any one of these officers to head the SIT or suggest a name on his own.Besides, Vij said other members of the SIT will be IPS officer Subhash Yadav and additional excise commissioner Vijay Singh.Meanwhile, a day after main accused trader Bhupinder surrendered before police, he was produced in a local court, which sent him in four-day police remand.

10-05-2020||Delhi||SC questions Haryana govt over remission policy||The Supreme Court has questioned the Haryana government over a policy of granting remission to life-term convicts aged 75 years or above, saying it appeared to be in “conflict” with a provision of law.The apex court has directed the state government to respond within two weeks on whether such a policy, which the court said appeared running counter to section 433-A of the CrPC, could be framed under Article 161 of the Constitution.Section 433-A of the CrPC also says that a convict shall not be released from jail unless he had served at least 14 years of the imprisonment, if he has been sentenced to life for an offence that entails maximum of death sentence or in cases where capital punishment has been commuted.The issue came up before a bench of Justices U U Lalit and Dinesh Maheshwari which was hearing an appeal in a criminal case. The bench was informed about a policy which stated that on the occasion of August 15, 2019, the governor of Haryana had granted special remission to certain prisoners who were undergoing sentence.As per the policy, special remission could be granted to those, including male convicts of 75 years or above who were sentenced for life and have completed eight years of the actual sentence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/sc-questions-haryana-govt-over-remission-policy/story-icRxfLZWOkzoozgKowd5VM.html

The development comes after 16 new cases were reported in the district on Saturday, which was the second-highest spike in the number of cases recorded in a single day (after May 6, when 17 new cases were reported in the district). The last time the district reported zero Covid-19 cases was on April 30.The total number of new samples tested, however, recorded a decline on Sunday. Only 195 samples were tested for Covid-19 in Gurugram on Sunday against 239 samples tested on Saturday. A total of 7,796 samples have been tested in the district so far. Out of these samples, around 1.8% of them have tested positive for Covid-19.A total of 128 new samples were also collected on Sunday, of which 73 samples were sent to government labs, and 55 to private labs for testing. As of Sunday, the test results of over 421 samples collected from the district are awaited.With no new cases on Sunday, the district’s total count of Covid-19 positive cases stays at 142, up from 51 cases recorded 11 days ago. Of these, 78 are currently classified as active cases, and 64 cases have been discharged so far, according to the district health department’s daily epidemic bulletin. However, the state-level bulletin issued Sunday evening showed 91 active cases in Gurugram, with 51 cases recovered. Health department officials said they would investigate the discrepancy, which was likely due to a lag in processing district-wise data.Gurugram has the highest number of Covid-19 positive cases in Haryana.Meanwhile, 11 new cases of Covid-19 were reported on Sunday from the neighbouring district of Faridabad, bringing the district total to 95 cases. The highest number of positive cases in the state were reported from Sonepat, where 23 more people tested positive for Covid-19 on Sunday.

The owners said they were disappointed by the direction as the chief minister also failed to allow inter-state movement.“Consider workers as your family members and you pay them the wages of the lockdown period as per the standing order of the ministry of home affairs (MHA) of the Union government,” said Khattar.He said the government on April 29 had announced an interest subsidy scheme, considering financial stress on industries, for the MSME to catalyse their revival. As per the scheme, Khattar reiterated, the Haryana government will pay the interest at 8 per cent a year for six months on the loan amount taken by the MSME from the banks, equivalent to ₹20,000/employee.The scheme, however, failed to satisfy those involved in MSMEs.Khattar also rejected a proposal to allow inter-state movement, especially to Delhi, after some industry owners raised the issue. “The government will continue to restrict the inter-state movement of people and will issue weekly inter-state movement passes for entrepreneurs staying outside the state (Haryana) so that they can come to Haryana, stay here to do work and go back home for the weekend,” said Khattar.“We raised the two issues — interstate movement and wages — with the CM, drawing his attention to the fact that the Gurugram industry owners are badly hit by these two problems. We requested the CM to allow inter-state movement passes and de-seal borers with Delhi. However, this issue has landed in court and we would like to be a part of the discussion as well, as, despite resumption of factories, border sealing has hit the business,” said JN Mangla, president, Gurgaon Industrial Association, one of the two representatives who attended the meeting.The labour department had sent a notice to industry owners on Thursday, to pay wages to workers by Monday.Pawan Yadav, president of IMT industrial association, who also attended the meet, said, “We do not want a rift between workers and owners, but we want the government to consider our financial constraints and help us accordingly. The government announced an interest subsidy for six months but that is not adequate to help us. We want government help in extending our loan tenure, at least by two years, such as from five to seven, seven to nine and likewise, as this will reduce the financial burden of every industry owner. We have brought this to the CM’s notice.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/cm-tells-factory-owners-to-pay-april-wages-refuses-to-open-borders/story-SQXn8vsTRWwfQm6OkTcOVP.html

The man and his friend have been isolated at a quarantine facility in Sector 9, the police said.According to the police, the Hira Nagar house has been sealed, and the health department has placed all 20 people, including children, who were living there under quarantine and their samples have been taken.The police said that the suspect, despite knowing that he is Covid-19 positive, was roaming around freely and was visiting the market and grocery stores. He came in contact with more than 100 people, police officials said.Dr Jaswant Singh Punia, chief medical officer (CMO), said that they are investigating the matter and trying to trace all the people who came in contact with the suspect.According to the police, on May 1, a team of health officials took samples of multiple people and shopkeepers at Khandsa Mandi for testing.Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that when the results came on May 4, the team found that nine people, including the suspect, had tested positive for Covid-19. “The Civil Hospital staff informed him regarding his reports over phone and asked him to get admitted, following which he switched off his mobile phone and vacated his room in Sector 10A and took shelter in his friend’s house. He did not tell anyone regarding the test report,” he said.Sangwan said that the hospital complained against the suspect and a case was registered at Shivaji Nagar police station. “The case was handed over to crime investigation agency (CIA), Sector 17. The CIA team took out the suspect’s call detail records and checked about his whereabouts. After questioning more than 100 people, the team got a tip-off that he was living with his friend in Hira Nagar,” Sangwan said.The CIA team led by Narender Chauhan conducted the raid at the Hira Nagar house and caught the suspect. “He surrendered after seeing people in protection gear. We called an ambulance and informed the hospital regarding his arrest,” Chauhan said.During an interrogation, the man told the police that he was scared about being isolated, the officials said. “Once he recovers from the disease, we will take necessary action against him,” said Sangwan.According to the health department, a total of 24 vegetable sellers have tested positive for Covid-19 at Khandsa Mandi so far. The wholesale vegetable market was shut down for four days for sanitisation and had resumed operations on Saturday. More than 1,600 people in the mandi were placed under surveillance and 128 samples were taken, said the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/vegetable-vendor-escapes-after-testing-positive-for-covid-19-comes-in-contact-with-100-people-arrested/story-kjMVRoVAlUasNP7ijyDjlI.html

Officials at the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said that the rainy conditions of lesser intensity may continue for a few more days. On Sunday, Noida received an estimated rainfall of 5 to 7mm, the officials said. According to the weather department, a strong western disturbance – a weather phenomenon that causes rains in the NCR – led to rains and winds in the region. The western disturbance will continue its effect in Noida and Ghaziabad for the next few days. While the maximum temperature of the region dropped by five degrees Celsius on Sunday, it is expected to hover around 35 to 36 degrees till Thursday (May 14), the officials said.“The NCR may see patchy rains for the next two days which will keep the temperatures under check. However, the intensity of winds will be lesser as compared to that of Sunday. Another fresh western disturbance is likely on Wednesday and Thursday, which will bring rains and strong winds of good intensity,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of regional weather forecasting centre, IMD.He said that while the average rainfall in the NCR was 1mm, the rains were of higher intensity across the eastern part of NCR, and eastern Uttar Pradesh.“The average speed of the winds was 73kmph. So, we can expect it to be higher in some places like Noida and Ghaziabad,” Srivastava added.On Sunday, the maximum temperature in the region was 35.5 degrees Celsius, four notches below the season’s average, against 40.9 degrees a day earlier which was two notches below the season’s average. The minimum temperature was recorded at 27.1 degrees Celsius, same as a day earlier.“The region is expected to see some patchy rains on Monday and Tuesday as well. The wind speed may drop to 30 kmph. However, the temperatures will remain below the season’s average,” said Mahesh Palawat, director of Skymet, a private weather forecaster.Meanwhile, complaints of disruption in power supply were reported from some parts of Noida, including Sector 92 and surrounding areas following the heavy winds and rains, power department officials said.“We did receive complaints of fault in power lines at a few places in Noida. It could have been due to rains. We are looking into it,” said VN Singh, chief engineer, Paschimanchal Vidhyut Vitran Nigam Ltd (PVVNL).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/strong-winds-rain-hit-noida-mercury-to-remain-below-normal-for-next-four-days/story-hAwTt2PpfrJEJDBsWQAdSP.html

Hoping that the national lockdown would not be extended further beyond April 17, forest officials said they have already started reviewing their preparations for the mass plantation and will soon start checking their records to ascertain the number of trees which are a-century-old in the district.“The forest department nurseries had been working during lockdown as well in order to ensure that the saplings stocked in our nurseries are maintained for the massive drive, which had been planned last year. This year’s target is 8.5 lakh trees for the district while we have maintained a stock of over 12 lakh healthy saplings across five departmental nurseries in the district,” said PK Srivastava, divisional forest officer, Gautam Budh Nagar.Speaking on heritage trees, officials said the department will have to go by older records to assess the locations of these trees.“We will visit the records soon to analyse how many trees in the city are older than 100 years. This may take some time. The idea is to protect them as heritage trees, which means they will be protected either by fencing or other means, and in no case would their axing be allowed,” said Srivastava.According to the government order dated May 8, the concerned departments involved in the mass-plantation drive shall also employ migrant labourers for the plantation work.“We will have to work out a plan to employ migrant labourers with plantation workers like digging pits for the plantation and other works during the massive drive. The duration of employment and wages will have to be worked upon,” said Srivastava.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/trees-older-than-100-years-to-get-heritage-tag-up-orders-mass-plantation-drive-on-july-1/story-ZQgGhq62N7nnGAOvoN8beP.html

If this cannot be allowed, then I suggest these businesses are given permission to function between 7am and 7pm,” he wrote, terming it a winning compromise.The Rajya Sabha member also reiterated his demand to exempt traders, cottage industries, small-scale enterprises, offices and commercial establishments from fixed electricity charges. “This step should be taken to protect businesses that may not be able to survive the situation otherwise.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/allow-cottage-industries-to-resume-ops-bajwa-to-cm/story-IOzGEfYZ1BXzjkta9d36yK.html

10-05-2020||City||UP to bring changes in MSME Act to generate more jobs||NOIDA: As the Covid-19 lockdown has severely affected the micro, small and medium enterprises in Uttar Pradesh, the state government has planned to amend its MSME Act, 2006, which will give the required push to the sector, officials said on Sunday. The proposed policy will help create more employment in the sector and attract foreign investment, the officials said, adding that the new amendment is about easing the norms for entrepreneurs. Navneet Sehgal, UP secretary of MSME and export promotion department, said since this sector plays a pivotal role in the economic development of the state, the government is paying considerable attention to the growth of industries by creating necessary infrastructure to ensure sustained industrialization in the state. “In order to attract foreign investment on the lines of small countries like Taiwan and Thailand, we are planning to create more competitive environment for our entrepreneurs here. To generate more employment along with ensuring rights for workers, setting up more MSME units is the need of the hour. We are planning changes in the MSME Act, under which the new units will not need to take any permission or no objection certificates at the time of their establishment. These new enterprises will get all their essential papers automatically in the last 100 days of their 1,000 days of establishment,” he said.Sehgal further said that the proposed rule will put a big positive impact on the MSME sector. “It will not only give MSME units the required push to recover the huge economic loss caused due to the Covid-19 lockdown, but will also ensure the growth rate of 12% per annum for the sector. It will also double the export from the state in the next five years. It is also going to benefit the ‘one district one product’ (ODOP) programme,” he said.The entrepreneurs associated with the sector of apparel, Gautam Budh Nagar’s ODOP, are very optimistic about the government’s vision to bring back the industry on track.Lalit Thukral, president of Noida Apparel Export Cluster (NAEC), said that since the garment industry is the second highest employment provider after the agriculture in the state, it will create millions of jobs. “With apparel as ODOP, Noida alone provides employment to approximately 20 lakh people. Majority of our workers, who are weavers and have returned home in other districts due to Covid-19 crisis, will certainly be reconnected to the textile industry to make UP a hub of weaving and textile mills. Also, by setting up industries nearer to villages, the government will boost confidence of the entrepreneurs,” he said.Thukral also said that the provision of single window system in the proposed Act will ensure qualitative development of the MSME sector in the state. “It is like reviving the old glory of the state, by providing jobs to each pair of hands,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/up-to-bring-changes-in-msme-act-to-generate-more-jobs/story-9aSdbWXOjH9qB2RLBqMQ1J.html
10-05-2020||City||Gzb health department plans shuffling of manpower to deal with any rise in Covid-19 cases||Ghaziabad: Anticipating a sharp rise in Covid-19 cases in coming days, officials of the district health department are now in search of bigger isolation and quarantine facilities and planning to reshuffle available manpower for optimum use. The Ghaziabad district added another four positive cases to its total tally, which stood at 137 till Sunday night. The new cases include two patients from Vaishali, the officials said.At present, the district has 166 Covid beds in two L1 category hospitals and 100 beds in an L2 category hospital. Besides, a 400-bed L3 category facility has also been approved by the state government. “Since we have limited manpower, we wish to make its optimum use in case there is a sudden rise in number of positive cases. We have planned that some teams comprising 25 doctors and other staff each, who till now were looking after patients at 30-bed L1 category hospital at Muradnagar, will be shifted to the new 200-bed L1 category facility at Niwari,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer.The health department has also identified 76-bed ESI Hospital at Sahibabad which is taken care of by the staff of the same hospital. To fine tune the St Joseph hospital in Nandgram, another L1 hospital with 60 beds, the CMO said that four government doctors will be sent there while the rest of the staff of the hospital will suffice.“In all, we have 166 beds of L1 category hospitals and 100 beds of L2 category government hospital at Sanjay Nagar. The teams at Sanjay Nagar hospital are not being used currently as there are no patients admitted. Besides, a 400-bed L3 category facility has also been approved by the state government and we will make use of their doctors and staff members,” Gupta said.Officials of the Sanjay Nagar government hospital said that they have two teams comprising 53 members each to look after complicated cases of Covid-19. “At present, we have no cases. A government doctor who has turned positive was with us for few days at our isolation ward and another female patient was here for three days. But our teams are undergoing training regularly. The teams are on standby and ready to be deployed if the situation demands,” said Dr Naresh Vij, chief medical superintendent of the hospital.Apart from the L1 category dedicated Covid hospitals, the health department has also identified a 100-bed facility as L1 attached hospital at Kadrabad and another 500 bedded facility at Modinagar, which will also function as L1 attached hospital.Under the UP government’s three-tier hospital set-up to deal with Covid-19 positive patients, the L1 hospitals are for normal patients while the L1 attached hospitals are meant for dealing with asymptomatic patients. The complicated cases are referred directly to L2 hospitals, while L3 category hospitals deal with patients requiring critical care.“With the identification of these hospitals, we have reached a level where optimum use of manpower available with us can be used. Similarly, we are in search of bigger quarantine centres with capacity of 500-1,000 beds. In all, we have about 1,683 beds available at our different quarantine centres. But the same manpower has the capacity to cater to bigger facilities. So, we have requested the administration to search for bigger centres as Ghaziabad has a number of engineering, medical and management colleges,” the CMO said.District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey could not be reached despite repeated attempts for a comment. The UP government had recently asked the districts to arrange for 15,000-20,000 capacity quarantine centres in each district and also directed building of about 52,000 Covid beds across the state to deal with any crisis.The CMO also said that they have about 260 teams comprising three members each who are taking up survey and surveillance in hots pot and containment areas.“On this count, we have limited manpower as we have to divert our staff meant for carrying on vaccination drives directed by the government,” Gupta added.Overall in UP, the tally of active cases of Covid-19 stood at 1,884 till Sunday evening and 1,504 patients were discharged so far. Overall, 9,003 people are in different quarantine centres across the state, the officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gzb-health-department-plans-shuffling-of-manpower-to-deal-with-any-rise-in-covid-19-cases/story-F89rB5I5RGgkWS8eKSuHFJ.html

Only two point — ‘Gajji Bhati Dwar, which opens near Ghazipur in Delhi and Vir Vijay Singh Pathik Dwar which opens at NH-9 — will remain open, while the rest have been barricaded and police deployed. The decision was taken in order to check the spread of Covid-19 cases. Otherwise, the problem could have become major, considering Khoda’s population and demography,” said KK Bhadana, the executive officer of Khoda Nagar Palika.According to estimates, Khoda is spread across an area of about 5 square kilometres and is located between Noida, Ghaziabad and adjoining Delhi. Officials said Khoda’s population is about 2.85 lakh but it’s estimated that the actual population may be more than 4 lakh.“No entry/exit will be allowed to and from Khoda. Only personnel involved in providing essential services will be allowed through the two points that are open. There are five police posts and it has been decided that police will identify and allow entry of vendors by giving them special passes Inside Khoda, grocery shops and those selling milk and vegetables will be allowed to open till 4pm, while medicine shops will be allowed to open 24x7,” he added.According to health department officials, Khoda has seen about 15 cases since April 22.Khoda also figures in the list of category 1 (area having at least one positive case and bound by 400 metres of perimeter area) and category 2 (area having more than one positive cases and bound by a perimeter of about 1km) containment zones in Ghaziabad. Rajiv Vihar, Indira Garden and Shiv Park areas of Khoda figure in the list of category 1 containment zones, while Hayat Nagar figures in the list of category 2 containment zone.Hindustan Times had on May 9 had reported on the rising number of Covid-19 cases in Khoda.Khoda serves a vital link to the three neighbouring cities of Delhi, Ghaziabad and Noida and most of its populace work as workers, as domestic helps or are engaged in small time jobs in these three cities“Joining work will become difficult now. I work in a small private company in Noida and somehow managed to come back home after work today in a vehicle that was headed to Khoda. I have told my office that I may not be able to join from Monday due to the sealing,” said Gopal Dixit, a resident of Prem Vihar , who works at as a security guard at a company in Noida Sector-58.“I also told my office that I may not be able to come to work from Monday. My office people told that they cannot help me in this regard. Even inside Khoda, there is no free movement as small lanes and bylanes have been barricaded,” said Arun Kumar, another resident who works as daily wager at a company in Sector-65, Noida.According to executive officer Bhadana, an estimated 20,000 people from Khoda go to delhi, Noida nad ghaziabad to work daily. Around 1.5 lakh people from Khoda, he said, had already left for their hometowns after the lockdown was announced.District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey and sub-divisional magistrate Aditya Prajapati did not respond to calls for a comment on the issue.“Khoda has not been sealed as such. There are many people who work in Noida . They have been told to stay at their places of work. Noida being in the Red zone, their inter-district movement has been stopped.

It’s the duty of the team sent by the Red Cross to carry the body to the pyre, but they didn’t do it,” a worker at the cremation ground said.Because of the incident another family wanting to cremate a loved one at the LPG furnace was asked to use the traditional wood pyre as the waiting period would have been long, the worker said.According to protocols related to cremation of remains of Covid-19 patients, the body, sealed at the hospital, has to be kept on the pyre by teams transporting it.Downplaying the incident, however, municipal corporation commissioner KK Yadav said, “There was a misunderstanding between the two parties. We have instructed Red Cross officials and employees at the cremation ground to be more cordial with each other.”There was no reason to fear infection while transporting bodies of Covid-19 patients as these were sealed carefully at hospitals, he added.It takes about two to three hours to cremate a body at the LPG facility and the next one is brought only after the place has been cleaned thoroughly after cremation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/row-as-workers-transporting-body-of-covid-19-patient-refuse-to-place-it-on-pyre-in-chandigarh/story-gbf8F7zn7PLccX4DjOPLgN.html

Javed Akhtar, poet, lyricist and political activist, said this while speaking during a webinar on domestic violence organised by the Bar Council of Punjab and Haryana. He said that to eliminate domestic violence, parents need to treat males and females equally. “Women should have equal share of properties and males and females should not be segregated in the society.”“It is not a problem only among the needy, but even rich people are facing the same issue,” he said.Indira Jaising, senior advocate and legal activist, who was also a panellist, said, “In most of the cases, I have seen women do not want divorce, but they want violence to end. They do not want to go to the court. It is the patriarchy which has to end and patriarchy resides in every religion.”Elizabeth Betsy Andersen, executive director of World Justice Project, said, “According to our study, most people do not access legal assistance as they do not understand their rights. We need to educate them about these rights,” she said.She said, “During the Covid-19 lockdown we have seen a delayed response in addressing these issues and there has been a problem in providing shelter to those who faced such issues.”“We have seen increase in cases of domestic violence during the lockdown. We are developing strategies to mitigate the violence against women,” said Sangeeta Rege, coordinator of Centre for Enquiry into Health and Allied Themes (CEHAT).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/reopening-liquor-shops-can-increase-crimes-against-women-javed-akhtar/story-T1o076HXtHKxGC5SjcJ3UP.html

All the forest employees were praising the gracious gestures of the two female guards, Ahlawat said.As the babies are unable to graze, the female guards keep them in their houses in forest colony and feed them milk through bottles used for feeding own children. The benevolent act touched the top brass, including Dipak Singh, principle secretary, environment and forests, Bihar. Singh praised the female officers and Ahlawat for showing empathy towards the hapless babies. “The baby deer will be taken care of till they get sufficient strength,” said Ahlawat. It would take minimum 10 days, he added.

Due to the slow lifting process, lakhs of quintals of the procured wheat got drenched in the mandis, leaving the arhtiyas and officials associated with the procurement process high and dry.The arhtiyas alleged that even though over 2 lakh metric tonnes of wheat was reaching the mandis daily, the lifting process was not being carried out as per the procurement. According to them, slow lifting of grain and inadequate arrangements to keep the wheat covered had worsened the situation, especially at the temporary procurement centres.As per the figures given by the Haryana food and supplies department, out of the total 57.5 lakh metric tonnes of wheat procured in the state, around 40% or 23.22 lakh MT was still lying in the mandis.“My 500 bags of wheat are lying in the open. We have repeatedly requested the mandi secretary in Nilokheri to allow us to shift our wheat to the sheds but he did not listen us, even though the sheds were lying empty,” said a commission agent of Nilokheri of Karnal district.As per commission agents, it was the responsibility of the government agencies that had procured the wheat to protect it until it reaches the godown. In some grain markets, farmers were seen pumping out water from purchase centres to protect their wheat.The farmers are also facing difficulties in selling their produce as the rains have affected the procurement process.Shubhash Chander, a farmer of Shikarpur village of Hisar district, said, “My wheat is lying in open at the grain market in Hisar. We request the local administration to arrange for proper sheds to keep our produce safe.”Karnal deputy commissioner Nishant Yadav said instructions have been issued to the procurement agencies in Karnal and 69.07% of the wheat has been lifted, which is highest lifting percentage in Haryana. Around 30% still remains in mandis, he added. Met officials predict change in weather The meteorology department at the Chaudhary Charan Singh of Haryana Agriculture University predicted that the weather had changed and asked the farmers to stop sowing the next cycle of crop.ML Khichar, head of meteorology and agriculture department, said that due to western disturbances the weather condition had changed from May 10 and will continue to be the same till midnight of May 13.(With inputs from Bhaskar Mukherjee in Hisar)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rain-affects-procurement-tardy-lifting-worries-arhtiyas-farmers-in-haryana/story-cU3FYGsbWXMYUJ3enypMVI.html

As of now, no trains are going to Bengal. We have no option but to turn them away. Despite this, they gather in large numbers to enquire sometime even twice a day.”“While seeing that migrants of other states are going back, there is a panic among those from Bengal. Most of them are losing patience and want to return back at any cost. Hence, are frequenting to the police station to hear some good news about their return,” said Satish Gaikwad, senior police inspector, Kalamboli police station.“My friends from other states like Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand have gone. Many are assures to board the train then why aren’t we sent back to our homes.

This is an insensitive regime that is imposing anti-farmers orders,” the Congress leaders said.They said the Congress was not against the crop diversification or water preservation, but was against the denial of ‘inalienable’ rights to the farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/diktat-to-restrict-paddy-cultivation-amounts-to-denial-of-fundamental-rights-says-congress/story-AxacRoMULe2OlWRfcn4WkO.html
10-05-2020||City||Working in the Times of Pandemic: ‘Disposing of waste from hospitals treating Covid-19 patients on same day key challenge’||The biggest contribution of the lockdown due to coronavirus outbreak is the cleanest and pollution-free environment not only in the region, but all over the country. Stating this, senior environment engineer, Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB), Sandeep Behl, said, “In my entire career of 32 years, I have never seen Ludhiana’s environment this much clean. Punjab’s industrial hub is witnessing pollution-free air and water after a long period. It is now our collective responsibility to maintain this environment even post-lockdown.”Behl said, “The air quality index (AQI) of Ludhiana had sunk to 27 on March 28 even below that of Toronto, whose AQI on the same day was recorded at 68. The AQI of Ludhiana used be generally between 170 to 180. At present, the AQI of Ludhiana is around 94.”Behl said, “While the PPCB is presently studying the database of clean Satluj river, Buddha Nullah, discharge of water at Ludhiana’s sewerage treatment plants, air and water quality during the curfew for future policy formation, the major challenge is the management of the biochemical waste from the health facilities treating Covid-19 patients and quarantine centres during the times of the pandemic.”“While the general waste can be preserved for 24 hours, the biochemical waste being generated from the facilities treating coronavirus patients needs to be lifted, transported and incinerated on the same day. We have signed an agreement with all hospitals and medicare service centres for providing a biochemical waste management facility, that has been functioning to treat the medical waste without any delay,” he said.Behl said, “Initially, the municipal corporation’s garbage collectors used to collect waste from the homes, where suspected Covid-19 patients have been quarantined, along with the waste of other homes. But, mixing quarantine centres’ waste with that of the general waste could have been risky, so we got details of quarantine homes from zonal commissioners and ensured that the waste generated from such residences, where patients have been quarantined, is collected separately,” said Behl.“The PPCB has been closely observing the massive changes in the environment during the lockdown.

While students who were earlier registered on the platform would use it for two-three days a week, the company said that most students now use it every day as schools remain shut. “There is a 200% increase in online engagement on the app. This shows that with schools continuing to be shut and all other learning sources being unavailable, digital adoption has increased significantly during this time. There has been a big behavioural shift in the parents’ mindset towards learning online as they have witnessed their kids benefit from it,” said Mrinal Mohit, chief operating officer at BYJU‘S.Udemy, an online learning platform that offers different courses on its platform has seen an overall spike in enrolments of over 200% in India, with the content on its platforms seeing an increase of over 50%. The highest surge in enrolments was seen for courses on communication skills, art and coding for kids amongst others. “The trends over the last two months represent a significant acceleration in the transformation to a new future,” said Darren Shimkus, president, Udemy for Business.Another learning platform, Schoolnet India, which provides e-learning services to over 10,000 schools said that there was an increase in the traction after the shutting down of schools. In the first 4-5 days, the platform’s sign-up rate tripled. “Our call centre traffic has also increased proportionately, and demand for online classes is also growing every day,” said Shourie Chatterji, Head - digital initiatives, Schoolnet India.Ahana Sethi, a city-based parent said that while most schools have now started online classes, children still get a lot of free time. “They spend only three-four hours in the online classes and hence parents want to engage them in activities apart from studies. Since going out is not an option anymore, many are preferring online courses on art, language learning, etc.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/online-platforms-see-unprecedented-surge-in-demand/story-zHHbBLvqT3OMV8xxZNhUvL.html

They stressed on the urgent need for reopening of the malls on lines of that of liquor shops to discourage workers from going back to their hometowns as a large number of migrants work in malls.Jehangir Dorabjee, owner of Dorabjee Heritage Mall, said “Wearing of masks can be made mandatory for entry into the malls and also inside the malls. There are sanitisers available which can be kept at all the touchpoints inside. Crowd control can be done easily as we have good experience in doing it for a long time.”“Similarly, social distancing norms can be strictly maintained. We can check the body temperatures at the entrance of the malls and we have trained staffers to execute these customer-centric initiatives. All the guidelines of the district administration, state government, police and health department can be put in place and adhered to strictly as a part of cautionary measures inside the malls,” he said.Malls along with cinema halls and public parks were among the first thing the state government closed on March 25. As per Centre’s guidelines issued on May 2, a day before lockdown 3.0 was imposed, malls and cinema halls will remain closed till May 17.Naval Kishore Ram, district collector, said, “The proposal for reopening of malls is under consideration and we are looking into it.”Prominent builder Satish Magar, national president, Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association, (CREDAI), said that he endorses the reopening of the malls stand taken by the Retailers Association of India.“Malls have a well-defined structure and culture of controlled access to the customers where social distancing and other health department norms can be easily observed and strictly followed inside all the malls,” said Magar.“We want the state government to permit the reopening of the malls at the earliest. Currently, the mall industry employs more than 30,000 workers and their future is also at stake,” he said.Another businessman Ikram Khan said, “ Malls have digital contactless payment systems that ensure minimal contact. Malls are the most controlled business establishments with dedicated entries and exits and entries. So, the customers can be checked, controlled and then only let in.”“ The government must consider opening up the malls for business and levy a guideline for the same as has been done with the opening of other business establishments,” he said. Pune has over a dozen big malls and several medium-scale malls which caters to the buying needs of a large number of population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/open-malls-and-save-jobs-of-30k-workers-say-owners-in-pune/story-vZ36zx77lrjiOiuhQCO9eI.html

10-05-2020||City||In 5 days, 11 cases of stubble burning reported in Mohali||While the state government machinery is busy fighting the Covid-19 outbreak, farmers in Mohali district have begun to burn wheat stubble. In the past five days, the district has witnessed 11 farm fires, for which one farmer has been challlaned.Last year, 206 farm fires were reported of which 190 were verified. While 19 FIRs were registered, seven violators were sent to court for prosecution. Surprisingly, in the past three years, only one farmer has been convicted in Mohali district.The cases have been registered under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) which involves imprisonment for up to two years with a fine of ₹1,000. However, registering of FIRs for the offence, too, has failed to act as deterrent.The 11 farm fires reported in the past five days were reported from five villages–Bishanpura, Hassanpura, Basouli, Jhawanse and Rampur Sainian in Dera Bassi block, and villages–Rurkikalan, Shekan Majrim Hoshairpur, Bathalana and Manakpur in Kharar block of the district.Stubble burning in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh has been an ongoing issue for the last several years. Last year on November 4, the Supreme Court had come down hard on the three states and asked their respective governments to check stubble burning, failing which the entire administrative and police hierarchy, ranging from the chief secretary to sarpanch and local policemen were to be held responsible for even a single farm fire.Ashok Sharma, the executive engineer (XEN) of Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB), said that in the past five days 11 fire cases were reported and one challan of ₹2500 issued to a Dera Bassi farmer. “We are still verifying them, following which challans will be issued. All our nodal officers will be active from May 11 and this time we will not spare anyone,” he said.Mohali deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan said directions have already been given to officers to file cases against violators. Even the revenue department has been asked to make red entries in the land records of guilty farmers. A red entry would bar the farmer from eligibility for any government facility or loan from any bank or institution, he said.Severity of challans depends on the farm area. If stubble is burned on less than 2 acres, a challan of ₹2500 will be issued, a challan of ₹5000 will be issued for 2 to 5 acres and for above 5 acres, a challan of ₹15000 will be issued.Seeking to tackle the issue of stubble burning by farmers in Punjab and Haryana, last year in December, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had launched a pilot project to produce green coal with paddy straw in National Agri-Food Biotechnology Institute (NABI) and Center of Innovative and Applied Bioprocessing (CIAB), Mohali. According to NABI engineers, the coal produced at the centre will be supplied to thermal plants in Punjab at lesser cost. The plant with a production capacity of 150 kg per hour and one tonne per day has been set up on premises of NABI for research and development. NABI will be buying stubble from farmers in the vicinity at ₹1,500 per tonne and the cost of green coal produced will range from ₹6 to ₹7 per kg as compared to the actual cost of ₹8 to ₹10 per kg, depending upon the quality.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/in-5-days-11-cases-of-stubble-burning-reported-in-mohali/story-1GACipwcd77n0ARck5evPK.html

According to JR Chaudhary, president, Mohali Senior Citizen Council, most of the domestic workers have already left the city. “We will be facing major problems as they have said they are likely to come back only after six months. Most couples here work and once the lockdown is lifted they have to go to office,” he says.Three projects delayedThree major projects of the Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) likely to be delayed because of lack of workers include one related to additional water supply under Phase 5 and 6 of Kajauli waterworks, expected to be completed in March next year. The new deadline is likely to be July 2021. Building of the eight km stretch from New Sunny Enclave to Mulllanpur, which was to begin from April 15, is now likely to start in July.Construction of a bridge dividing the Sector 80/81 road, already delayed by two years and expected to be completed by March this year, is now likely to finish in August.GMADA chief engineer Sunil Kansal says most of the authority’s workers have left for their homes with just 30% remaining. “Our project will be delayed by three to four months as we do not have any other option now,” he says.Industrialists who have opened up after partial lifting of restrictions are also worried about increasing productivity at a time when there is hardly anybody around to do the work. There are around 13,000 MSME units and 49 large industrial units in Mohali that employ 1.3 lakh persons, out of which 78,000 labourers have gone back to their states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/workforce-crisis-looms-as-10-000-migrants-leave-mohali/story-wxGwv7Ro1Ak2JmZc41ddzI.html

They have also requested the government to set up a coordinating committee to help them provide provisions to migrants walking to their hometowns. Since the lockdown, many NGOs in Thane started helping the families of labourers and beggars living on the street.“We have been getting the list of labourers in the city from Thane municipal corporation and collectorate department. Based on the data, we have provided ration to over 3,500 people. However, due to the lockdown, we are not getting adequate donations as donors have reached their limits. Hence, if government agencies help us in providing essential commodities, we can reach more families,” said Nishant Bangera, 28, founder, Muse foundation, in Thane.NGO volunteers have been provided with special identity cards by the government to carry out the distribution of food packets and ration among the needy.“Other than labourers, there are many migrants walking on highways to reach their hometowns. We expect the government to set up a coordinating committee, to help us provide space at proper spots on the highways to set up water, food stalls and toilets for them,” added Bangera.“Since the lockdown, we have provided ration to around 350 people in Mumbra and Kalwa area. But presently, we have been facing a funds crunch,” said a 39-year-old volunteer associated with Childhelpline group in Thane.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/thane-ngos-face-funds-crunch-ask-govt-agencies-for-aid/story-gBAzpbc98L08G3e8CcuM0H.html

10-05-2020||Chandigarh||Rain, gusty winds hit Chandigarh, Mohali||With heaviest rain for any May day since 2014 recorded within an hour and wind speeds peaking at 88 kilometre/hour, Chandigarh and its satellite city of Mohali reported several cases of uprooting of trees and branches falling on parked vehicles on Sunday.According to India meteorological department (IMD), around 0.5mm rain had been recorded till 8:30am, post which 31.2mm was recorded till 9:30am. Hail fall was also reported at the airport observatory while high-speed winds lasted for only a few minutes.In Chandigarh, there were three reports of uprooting of trees, on Sector 33/34 and Sector 37/41 dividing roads and in Sector 20. Power cuts were also witnessed in many sectors, and it took a couple of hours for electricity to return in most of them.However, it was in Mohali that the gusty winds left a trail of damage with both trees and electricity poles being uprooted and roads turning into streams in many parts.Reports of vehicles being damaged due to branches falling on them were received from Phases 2, 7, 8 and many other parts of the city. Roads in Phases 2, 3, 7 and 11 and the Industrial Area besides in Zirakpur town were submerged under water, bringing to the fore poor drainage system. Even power was disrupted in Sectors 76 to 80 for around four hours.‘Freak weather occurrence’According to IMD records, Wednesday (May 10) was the wettest May day since 2014, when 57.1mm rain was recorded on May 5. This was also the second wettest May day this decade. Calling it a “freak weather occurrence”, IMD regional director Surender Paul said: “The rain was significantly high due to confluence of low level easterly winds with western disturbances. The moisture-laden easterly winds coming from the Bay of Bengal were also the reason why rainfall was on the higher side in April. More spells on similar lines can be expected this month.”With 47.8mm rain recorded in the first 10 days, this month has already broken May’s record going back till 2016, when 63.8mm rain was recorded.According to Paul, chances of up to 30mm rain will continue on Monday. Chances of light rain will continue throughout the week, with periods of sunny weather. However, another system of western disturbances is expected to affect the city the next weekend. Wind speeds can reach up to 50 km/hr during this period and rain is likely to be accompanied with thunder and lightning. Hail can also be expected in some areas.Meanwhile, maximum temperature fell from Saturday’s 36.1°C to 29.7°C on Sunday, nine notches below normal owing to the morning showers and cloudy weather throughout the day. Minimum temperature saw a marginal rise from 22.2°C to 22.6°C, four notches above normal owing to the cloud cover at night.In the next three days, maximum temperature will remain between 33 and 35 degrees while minimum temperature will remain between 21 and 22 degrees, stated the IMD weather bulletin for Chandigarh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/rain-with-gusty-winds-hit-chandigarh-mohali/story-KMLtmP5uKnlrlaQfGge2hM.html
10-05-2020||Mumbai||HC grants lawyer extension till June 30 to pay for flat under CIDCO scheme||The Bombay high court (HC) has allowed a visually-impaired lawyer an extension up to June 30, to pay for a flat he had been allotted by the City and Industry Development Corporation (CIDCO) in 2014 , though the payment deadline was May 8 of this year. The lawyer claimed that due to the Covid-19 pandemic he was unable to arrange for the funds. CIDCO opposed the plea stating that the May 8 deadline was already an indulgence. The court, however, allowed the extension as a last chance on humanitarian grounds.A single bench of justice S C Gupte, while hearing the interim application of the lawyer, was informed that in 2014 he had been allotted a flat in the ‘Divyang’ quota under CIDCO’s housing scheme in Kharghar, Navi Mumbai. He was asked to pay nearly Rs 49. 7 lakh in instalments for the 600 square feet flat. However, in February 2018, the allotment was cancelled on the grounds of delay in payment and hence he approached HC.In December last year, HC quashed CIDCO’s allotment cancellation letter and allowed the lawyer to make delayed payments of nearly Rs 15.29 lakh in two equal instalments on humanitarian grounds. The first instalment was payable by February 7 and the second on or before May 8, 2020, after which the authority would handover possession to him.However, on May 5, advocate Nitesh Bhutekar filed an urgent application on behalf of the lawyer and informed the court that as Mumbai and Navi Mumbai were declared red zones and under lockdown, the applicant was finding it difficult to arrange funds and requested the court to grant him some time to make payment.Advocate Rohit Sakhdeo for CIDCO opposed the plea and said that the December order of the HC was already an indulgence, hence further extension should not be granted.After hearing the submissions, justice Gupte noted, “Considering unusual circumstances obtaining as of date, this court is of the view that a reasonable extension of time deserves to be granted to the applicant.” The court ordered that the applicant can pay balance instalment of Rs 7, 64, 974 by June 30 and stated, “This extension is granted only as an indulgence and by way of a last chance, and no application shall be made hereafter for further extension of time.”The bench added that in case of default, CIDCO would be entitled to cancel the allotment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-grants-lawyer-extension-till-june-30-to-pay-for-flat-under-cidco-scheme/story-gHVkxRWABVSCLZzcwsRVnL.html

10-05-2020||Gurugram||Khattar govt’s new scheme will discourage farmers from cultivating paddy: Cong||Opposition Congress on Sunday hit out at the recently announced crop diversification scheme by the M L Khattar government, saying there was a conspiracy to eventually stop the procurement of paddy at Minimum Support Price (MSP) by discouraging a large number of farmers from cultivating the crop. “Under the new autocratic order and scheme brought out by Khattar government, they now want farmers in eight different blocks which have been identified and 19 blocks in total to not cultivate paddy at all and punish the farmers by denying them MSP for paddy in case they still choose to grow this crop,” Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said.“They also want to deny farmers in 26 other blocks the right to grow paddy on Panchayati land. This is despite the fact that state government’s another (crop diversification scheme) ‘Jal hi Jeevan Hai’ scheme, launched last year, was surreptitiously closed and put under the table,” he added. Surjewala addressed a joint press conference with Haryana Congress president Kumari Selja through video conferencing. The Haryana government had on Wednesday announced Rs 7,000 per acre incentive to farmers for switching from water-guzzling paddy to other crops and said permission to sow paddy will not be given in panchayat areas where the ground water depth is more than 35 metres. The Congress leader asked if “punishing the farmers” by denying them MSP for paddy in case they continue to grow it in these blocks was the way forward. “By doing so, aren’t the farmers lives and livelihood being endangered by this government… What is the guarantee of success of this new scheme when their ‘Jal Hi Jeevan Hai’ scheme failed?” both Surjewala and Selja asked. Surjewala said under the ‘Jal Hi Jeevan Hai’ scheme, seven blocks in the state including Assandh, Pundri, Radaur and Ganaur were identified in which crop pattern over 1.37 lakh acres was to be shifted from paddy to other crops including maize. He said farmers were promised incentive of Rs 2,000 per acre, free hybrid seeds and payment of crop insurance premium, but the scheme failed and peasants were left high and dry. “Now, with this latest scheme, the government is again experimenting with the lives and livelihood of farmers in 19 new blocks, two of which fall in Kaithal district, four in Kurukshetra and one each in Fatehabad and Sirsa. Besides, there are 11 more blocks whose names have not been announced so far,” he said. “In addition, there are 26 blocks, largely of northern Haryana, where farmers do their cultivation on Panchayat land by taking it on lease have been prohibited from cultivating paddy. All this points out to a complete and inept government solely directing its schemes at eventually stopping the procurement of paddy at MSP, that is the main conspiracy behind it,” he claimed. He said Congress is not saying that crop diversification should not be done, “but how can farmers be deprived of right to till their land to sow the crop of choice”. Under the ‘Mera Pani Meri Virasat’ scheme, the farmers have to diversify at least 50 per cent of their cultivated paddy area by growing alternate crops like maize, cotton, bajra and pulses in those 19 blocks where ground water level has depleted to 40 meters. For these blocks, farmers will not be permitted to cultivate paddy in any new areas where paddy was grown during last year and they will be given incentive of Rs 7,000 per acre to switch over to other crops. Besides, in agriculture lands of Gram Panchayats in 26 blocks where ground water level has depleted to 35 meters, the Panchayat will not permit paddy growing in their lands. Surjewala said that with these orders, farmers will not be able to sow paddy in the 19 blocks spread across 2.30 lakh acres of land. He said that the previous Congress government had constructed Rs 400 crore Dadupur Nalvi canal, which would have proved to be a boon, especially to northern parts of Haryana by helping in water recharging, but the BJP led dispensation scrapped the project. “On one hand this government gives plea of water conservation, on the other hand they take decisions like scrapping the canal project which was to help raise water level,” Surjewala said. “Secondly, they have adopted stoic silence on SYL canal issue and despite court ruling in Haryana’s favour, no effort is being made by the government to ensure the state gets its due share,” said Surjewala.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/khattar-govt-s-new-scheme-will-discourage-farmers-from-cultivating-paddy-cong/story-LHl1ZbPK6uiyimjxqBnYOJ.html

Physical distance, personal hygiene, face protection helps, he tweeted in response to the Hindustan Times story on the HC order.DM Anshaj Singh had on April 30 restricted movement on grounds that most Covid-19 cases in Sonepat have a Delhi connection.Following this, a public interest litigation (PIL) was moved before the court stating that as Sonepat is not only contiguous to Delhi but also a part of the national capital region, a number of Delhi residents have to travel to Sonepat for essential work and vice versa.Hearing PIL, a division bench of the Delhi HC comprising Justice Manmohan and Justice Sanjeev Narula said: “This court is of the prima facie view that April 30 order issued by the Sonepat DM constituted an infringement of Articles 19(1)(d) and 301 of the Constitution, especially when the entire national capital and Sonepat are not containment zones.”Article 19 (1) (d) allows every citizen to move freely throughout the territory of India and Article 310 provides for freedom of trade, commerce and intercourse throughout the territory of India.Issuing notice to the Union and Haryana governments to file responses, the HC has listed the case for May 12.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/khemka-lauds-delhi-hc-order-on-sonepat-magistrate-s-actions/story-V0NXVRbXfMUeel0e9JzlQJ.html

10-05-2020||City||Shramik Express with 1,388 migrant workers leaves for Bihar from Bathinda||The first Shramik Express train from the south Malwa belt with 1,388 migrant workers left for Muzaffarpur, Bihar, from Bathinda railway station on Sunday at 11 am, deputy commissioner B Srinivasan said.The workers were returning to their hometowns and villages following the Covid-19 pandemic.Speaking to Hindustan Times at the railway station, many of them were emotional, saying financial concerns remained a major worry, apart from the virus outbreak.They said the authorities had provided them food, bottled water and free travel tickets. Mahesh Das, aged 38, said he was going back to Bhagalpur even though he had not lost his job as he was homesick and his wife and mother wanted him to come back. “I was working at Guru Gobind Singh Refinery (GGSR) in Bathinda and my job was safe. But I wanted to be with my family because of the pandemic. We have a small piece of agricultural land and what we get is insufficient to feed my family of five. I don’t know how I will support them now,” he said.Das’s co-passenger Sanjay Das, a mason, said he would like to return to Punjab once the situation normalised. “I had no work for a month because of the lockdown. We got dry rations from government agencies once and then I survived by borrowing money. I will stay put in my village at Bhagalpur with my family, including six children, till things get back to normal. I am the sole earning member of the family, but I have no work now,” he said.Anwar of Jaimangla village in Purnia district said the contractor he worked for in a construction business helped all workers and provided them food and essentials during the lockdown.“These are hard times but I know even my employer can support all his workers for a limited amount of time. Also, I wanted to be with my children. Opportunities are bleak at home, so I will have to come back once construction activities resume in Punjab,” he said.Meanwhile, Srinivasan said the administration had made elaborate arrangements for the safety of other migrant workers in the city, most of them from Bihar.About 27,000 persons had registered online to go back to the state, but only 3,000 had come forward for medical screening, he said.Another train would be leaving for Bihar on May 14, Srinivas disclosed.“As industries have resumed functioning now, many people are not that keen to go back now, he said.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/shramik-express-with-1-388-migrant-workers-leaves-for-bihar-from-bathinda/story-NCYOmgJhxTxAItwPM5YXxO.html
10-05-2020||Chandigarh||4 fresh cases take Chandigarh’s Covid count to 174||With four new Covid-19 cases reported on Sunday, the total count in Chandigarh has reached 174, which is almost double the 88 cases reported at the beginning of the month.A Sector 40 resident, who is a doctor at the civil hospital in Rupnagar, is among the fresh cases. UT health officials said he was working in the hospital’s laboratory and was also involved in taking samples of Covid-19 suspects, the likely source of infection. This is second case in Sector 40. In fact, 46 health workers of the Rupnagar civil hospital, including seven from Mohali, tested positive on Sunday evening. The Mohali district count, now, stands at 105.The remaining three cases of Chandigarh are from Bapu Dham Colony, the Covid-19 hotspot in Sector 26 which now accounts for 75% active and 63% total cases of Chandigarh with 110 infections. Those tested positive on Sunday are a five-year-old boy, who is a family contact of an infected person, and two males, aged 45 and 11, who are community contacts of another positive person. This has led to 56 community contacts and four family contacts of these people being put into quarantine.TEST POSITIVITY RATE MORE THAN NATIONAL AVERAGEThe overall test positivity rate (positive cases per total tests conducted) of Chandigarh has shot up to 8% as against the national average of 3.8%. This rise can be attributed to the two congested pockets of Bapu Dham Colony and Sector 30.Since the first case came to the fore in Bapu Dham Colony on April 24, the UT health department has conducted around 1,408 tests in which 143 persons have been found positive, accounting to a worrisome test positivity rate of 10%.The department on Sunday confirmed the death of a 62-year-old man of the colony, who had tested positive posthumously on Saturday. He had suffered a cardiac arrest three years back for which he had undergone angioplasty and angiography.COOPERATE WITH ADMN: IMAThe Indian Medical Association, Chandigarh, has appealed to the people to cooperate with the administration to limit the further spread of infection in the city.In a press statement, Chandigarh IMA president Dr Rajesh Dhir stressed that coronavirus was highly contagious and could spread through asymptomatic persons too. “Strict hand hygiene, maintaining social distancing norms and using face masks in public places have been found to be effective in preventive its spread,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/3-new-covid-19-cases-from-bapu-dham-chandigarh-s-count-173/story-7hyt23eCIHVnltnDraw0DL.html

The criticism came after the health department issued an order allotting three hotels in east Delhi, out of which two in the five-star category, for the treatment of officials of government offices, autonomous bodies, corporation and local body officers and their family members if they contract Covid-19.“The hospital is directed to provide healthcare facility at these hotels to the Covid positive officer/officials treating as if they are admitted in the hospital. Serious patients could be shifted to the main hospital area,” the order said about the Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital.On Sunday, Arvind Kejriwal said the government is responsible for those who are working on the frontline to fight Covid-19.“Frontline workers are risking their lives and fighting the coronavirus disease day in and day out. And it is our responsibility to take care of them if they fall sick,” the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader said.“I want to ask you shouldn’t these Covid warriors be given special facilities. They must. What’s the harm if some money—Rs 1, 2, 3, 5, 20 crore—is spent. What’s wrong with it?” he asked.The AAP leader cited the example of Delhi Police constable Amit Rana, who died after contracting Covid-19, and said his family was given Rs 1 crore to honour him.“Why is the opposition so troubled? This is my request to everyone that this is no time for doing politics but for all of us to think about what we can do to fight against corona. We need to think about that,” he said.“Don’t indulge in issuing political statements and help each other,” he said.The Delhi chief minister also said there are 6,923 coronavirus cases so far in the national capital, 2,069 patients have recovered and 73 have died.He added that out of the 6,923 Covid-19 patients, only 1,476 are admitted at hospitals.

10-05-2020||Delhi||Sunday’s earthquake was third to hit Delhi in a month, with same epicentre||An earthquake of 3.4 magnitude struck Delhi on Sunday afternoon with its epicentre at Sonia Vihar. This is the third earthquake to hit Delhi in about a month.On April 12, a 3.5-magnitude quake had struck Delhi and its neighbouring region. Interestingly, the epicentre of that earthquake was also near Sonia Vihar in North-East Delhi (near Wazirabad) at almost the same location.According to officials at the National Centre for Seismology (NCS) helpline, people had called and reported tremors from near the epicentre on Sunday. The quake occurred at 1.45 pm at a depth of five kilometres, said the NCS.The location coordinates of the event is latitude 28.7 N and longitude 77.2 E. Seismologists said it’s too early to say why there is another earthquake with the same epicentre.“There are many faults in and around Delhi. There is the Sohna fault, Mathura and Mahendergarh faults which can contribute to earthquakes. There are several lineaments (an expression of an underlying geological structure such as a fracture) also. One lineament could have activated other lineaments. But we need to refine our recordings and findings to see what happened,” said AP Pandey, seismologist at NCS.The location coordinates according to NCS for the previous earthquake was also latitude 28.7 north and longitude 77.2 east, and the depth was 6.5 kilometres. On April 13, another low-intensity earthquake of magnitude 2.7 shook parts of Delhi. The quake occurred at 1.26 pm at a shallow depth of 5 kilometre in North-East Delhi (near Wazirabad).It’s not unusual for epicentre of these relatively small earthquakes to be in Delhi and neighbouring Haryana, seismologists said. But in April the experience was much more intense for people in Delhi because of less noise associated with traffic movement due to the ongoing Covid-19 lockdown.Of the seismic zones in India, Delhi falls under the fourth-highest zone, making it vulnerable to earthquakes. But it is rare that Delhi has been the epicentre of a quake. It, however, experiences tremors when a quake hits regions as far as central Asia or the Himalayan ranges, known to be a high-seismic zone.An earthquake of magnitude 2.8 had hit the national capital in 2004. Another quake of magnitude 3.4 was recorded in the city in 2001.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/sunday-s-earthquake-was-third-to-hit-delhi-in-a-month-with-same-epicentre/story-2fAwnI1iIwobFyJFPD5CjO.html

10-05-2020||Kolkata||Labourers refuse to work at Bengal cement plant, allege violation of social distancing norms||Around 350 contractual labourers at a cement factory in West Bengal’s Murshidabad district on Saturday refused to join duty, saying the management did not take measures to ensure social distancing in the production area.The factory in the Raghunathgunj police station area is among the industrial units which have been allowed by the Trinamool Congress government to start production with limited manpower amid the Covid-19 lockdown.The labourers, who were assembled by a contractor, did not join duty and staged a protest outside the factory which produces cement for a renowned brand. Around 700 people used to work there before the coronavirus pandemic started. It reopened on April 20.“We didn’t raise any objection when the factory started with 50-odd workers. However, on Friday night, hundreds of people were asked by the contractor to join duty. On Saturday morning, 350 people assembled for duty and were asked to start work,” Safikul Sheikh, assistant secretary of the workers’ union, said. “The factory is not big enough to ensure social distancing but the management refused to listen. They are providing each man with an ordinary mask. We will work only if our health is not at risk,” said Sheikh.Kaushik Sinha, one of the 17-odd contractors who supply labourers to the plant, said the plant is not big enough to accommodate 350 people and maintain social distance as well. “On Friday night, I was asked to supply some labourers. I heard that around 300 people refused to work,” Sinha said.The agitation has been noted by local doctors. “This kind of awareness will help us stop spreading of the coronavirus in the community,” Dr Arijit Banerjee, a senior officer of the state health department, said.Arup Banerjee, general manager (personnel) of the factory, dismissed the labourers’ claims.“It is not true that they refused to join duty because there was a violation of safety norms. They want extra payment for working during the lockdown,” Banerjee said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/labourers-refuse-to-work-at-bengal-cement-plant-allege-violation-of-social-distancing-norms/story-WwyRCREXjP8uYfHijCO9ZK.html

He not only helped authorities make preparations for the last rites of Gurjant Singh, the 56-year-old Nanded returnee who died on Saturday, but along with tehsildar Manmohan Koshik, he also sensitised the villagers about the situation. This comes in the backdrop of the protests in Verka village in Amritsar last month, where residents stood against the cremation of a former hazoori ragi (hymn chanter) of Golden Temple, Bhai Nirmal Singh Khalsa, who died of Covid-19.Gurjant, a labourer under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), was cremated at village crematorium on Saturday evening. Marks were drawn at the cremation ground to ensure that the people follow social distancing.Manuke village sarpanch Gurmukh Singh said, “Gurjant travelled a long distance to come home and be among his people. In these circumstances, if we deny him the right to be cremated here, it would be a grave injustice.”He further said, “For how long we will continue to be scared of the decease and snap ties with our loved ones just because they have incidentally come in contact with the virus. I was shaken when the residents had denied the cremation of hazoori ragi Nirmal Singh Khalsa in the village crematorium in Amritsar. We need to change this notion. We just have to start living with the virus and maintain a safe distance from the infected persons.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/manuke-village-shows-the-way-gives-a-decent-funeral-to-covid-victim/story-o4QmuSUd0FlgEl882JDIJJ.html

10-05-2020||Lucknow||Lucknow woman trudges 900 km to save daughter from Covid-19||Standing beside a deserted highway on the outskirts of the state capital under the scorching May sun, Rukhsana Bano signals a passing truck for a lift. She is carrying a small bag in one hand and holds her three-year old-daughter, Nargis, on her shoulder with the other. The truck speeds away without slowing.The 25 year-old woman is on a 900 km journey to her home in Amethi from Indore on foot, just to save her child from the dreaded corona virus.“My daughter has not eaten since last night. I am worried about her. If we don’t get any vehicle we will continue our journey on foot,” she said, signalling towards a group of eight people (her relatives), who travelled with her to reach the safety of their home.A native of Jagdishpur in Amethi, Rukhsana and her husband Aqib lived in Indore, Madhya Pradesh. The husband was a waiter at an eatery while Rukhsana worked as domestic help. They managed their expenses with the Rs 9,000 her husband earned and saved the Rs 3000 she earned for the future of their daughter. Rukhsana could not study beyond Class 8 but she wanted to educate Nargis.Then came the pandemic, followed by the lockdown and the couple lost their jobs. Their meagre savings evaporated within days. Rukhsana refused to withdraw a single penny from the money she saved for her daughter. But what worried her more was the rapid spread of Covid-19 in Indore.“Har gali mohalle se coronavirus ki kahabar aane lagi. Pura shahar band kar diya. Hum log ghar me rahe taki Nargis ko corona na ho (People in every ally were infected by Covid-19. The entire city was closed down. We stayed inside our houses to prevent Nargis from getting infected), “ she said.Indore, known as the business hub of Madhya Pradesh, is one of the worst affected cities by Covid-19 in central India.Some of her relatives decided to walk back home when the lockdown was extended again in April but Nargis decided to stay back, hoping things would improve. But when the lockdown was extended for the third time last week, her patience wore out. “The infection was increasing and I got worried, thinking what will we do if we or our daughter get infected. So I decided to somehow return to our family in Amethi,” she said.But leaving Indore was not easy. Her husband of four years decided to stay and refused to accompany her. Rukhsana tried to persuade him but later decided to head home to save her child from the possibility of infection. She joined a group of relatives returning to Amethi, packed some biscuits, jam and clothes in a bag and left home.The group started walking from Indore on Wednesday night. After a lift on two trucks and a tractor and walking for over 24 hours, they reached Lucknow on Saturday. The journey took a toll on their bodies. All of them had blisters on their feet and looked exhausted and famished.After cleaning their wounds and a brief halt under a thorny bush along the roadside, the group decided to hit the road again. Their frail tired bodies began walking on the road again, Rukhsana with her child in front of the group. She covered Nargis with a piece of cloth as she braved the sun, realising that this journey was only a part of the hardships she would have to face to raise her daughter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/trudging-900-km-to-save-daughter-from-covid-19/story-62QNDDaOkLXRBNXmSkCniK.html

10-05-2020||Delhi||Lockdown 3.0: Cheers to e-tokens for booze in Delhi?||As soon as liquor shops got permission to resume operations, one could see serpentine queues or hordes of people, without any fear of the still prevalent coronavirus — all for a bottle or two of alcohol. The situation gave a good opportunity to the meme makers, and compelled many to think if alcohol should now be made available, to boost the economy, while risking the health of citizens who compromised on the advisory issued for Delhi, which still falls under the Red Zone. Probably, this brought a twist to the tale and brought in e-tokens to arrange for a systematic sale of alcohol. The government has issued a web link www.qtoken.in where people can log in and purchase the e-token required to get liquor from a nearby shop. Mohit Mishra, an MNC employee and a resident of Malviya Nagar, recalls how he ventured out on day one of the reopening of liquor shops in Delhi, and came back empty handed. He says, “Standing in queues without following any guidelines is a big no for me at this time when the fear of corona is still there. I am totally up for e-token system; at least I would be sure of getting booze without getting corona back home! Last time, I had to return empty handed due to the chaos, hope it won’t be the same now.”The link generates a unique e-token, which will be valid for one hour. “It’s much better than the earlier suggested plan of home delivery, since it will also keep in check that only those above 21 years of age can book their turn. Not just that, it will also ensure social distancing and I am assuming that other laws relevant for the sale of alcohol will also be put into place now,” says Piyush Dudega, a Gurugram-based entrepreneur.But not everyone is applauding this new plan of action for systematic sale of alcohol. Dinesh Mangla, chartered accountant and a resident of Karol Bagh, says, “Government is ignoring the fact that in the wake of boosting their economy, they are ruining the lives of many. Alcohol addicts will do anything to get their dose of desi even if it means getting it at the cost of their own family members. For the last 45 days, their addiction was in control, but now I fear that the situation will get much worse.” Those corona warriors, who were on duty outside wine shops, feel relieved that at least their efforts to keep people’s lives safe won’t go wasted. RP Meena, DCP (Southeast), says, “The buyer will be given a time slot for the purchase and only limited number of people can come in at a given time, which will help maintain the social distancing norm. Since the crowd problem will be solved, it will be easier to handle them.” And Anant Kumar Gunjan, SHO, Amar Colony police station, adds, “This process is much better. First, it would be easier to maintain social distancing, and second, the notorious elements who could sell alcohol in black market will get eliminated. It also makes the situation safer for cops as well as the shopkeepers to fulfil their responsibility without worrying about their own health.” Follow @htdelhi for more||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/lockdown-3-0-cheers-to-e-tokens-for-booze-in-delhi/story-JCVOhP2dP9tU6xgVErFb7H.html
10-05-2020||Delhi||Delhi University’s North East hostel girls stuck in lockdown lurch||Students residing in Delhi University’s North Eastern Students House for Women in Dhaka complex, North Campus say that they are being pressurised to vacate the premises by May 31, which is the last day of the contract for mess operations under the present caretaker. The impending building maintenance work in July is another reason why the authorities are demanding students to vacate the hostel. But, the hostellers claim that the Provost has been asking them to pack their bags and leave for good, even before the lockdown was announced. As a result, many from the 100 students residing here had left, but 13 girls are still inside the premises, and are clueless as to how to safely reach their homes in remote areas.“The provost has been mentally torturing us since the very beginning of the lockdown. She told us that the mess would stop functioning due to the shortage of payment for the mess workers. But, we feel it’s the responsibility of the hostel to provide us with all the basic amenities at a time like this when it is so difficult to go back to our home without any proper availability of transport services,“ says a hosteller, on condition of anonymity. Another hosteller informs that while she did make an arrangement for her local guardian to pick her up, it wasn’t a smooth affair. “On May 7, I sought permission to leave the hostel premises on account of my local guardian willing to take me to their place; to this I had received an affirmation. The next morning, I was called up by the Provost, who then asked me to submit my room keys to the house keeper and vacate the room by keeping my belongings in a separate room. I subtly replied that it wasn’t possible to vacate in such short notice. This went on for a good 45 minutes. Finally, I was forced to submit my keys to the guard in charge on the agreement with my guardian that the Provost would be in full responsibility lest anything happens to my belongings in my absence,” says Garima Rathi, a hosteller. The hostel authorities maintain that they are facing administrative problems in hosting the girls during the pandemic. Rita Singh, provost of North Eastern Students House for Women, says, “Administrative issues is liye aa rahe hai kyunki mujhe subah pata chala ki mere guard ke gali main kisi ko cornoavirus ho gaya hai, toh mere chaaro guard jo aas paas rehte hai woh nahi aa sakte. Maine bachho ko advisory ja ri ki hai ki Delhi ke halat thik nahi hai, toh agar kuch halfto main flight chalne lage toh aap apne safe jagah par chale jaaye. Mujhe safai walo ko bhi ho sakta hai band karna pade, toh phir bina guard ke, bina mess ki functioning ke, kaam kaise chalega? 13 logo ke liye hume itni badi building ka tension laga rehta hai.”Christina Ering, president, student welfare association of the hostel, says, “Many states in the North East have completely shut down and are not letting any outsider come in. How do the hostel authorities expect us to go back when all the modes of transportation are barred by the Government of India? How do we travel during such times? Delhi University and the HRD ministry has clearly given out notices asking the students to stay put where they are and not to travel... Other hostels like the Rajiv Gandhi Hostel for Girls, which has around 50 students, hasn’t given any such notice, and the same goes for International Students’ House For Women. The mess getting shut is Provost’s way of indirectly asking the girls to vacate the hostel. The girls have nowhere to go and they are panicking! Many are preparing for their assignments and exams but in such circumstances, no student is able to focus on studies.” Follow @htTweets for more||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-university-s-north-east-hostel-girls-stuck-in-lockdown-lurch/story-cbEoMmybBuUVl19T6P6qhI.html

He said different level of spaces will be created on payment basis. While CITCO’s Mountview and Shivalikview have already been factored in to, we are also in touch with other private hotels. We can also consider community centres for this purpose. More clarity is expected in next one or two days,” he saidResidents oppose move, admn makes tests mandatory After Parida broke the news on his Twitter handle, residents resisted the move, saying that there was risk of virus spread in to the city that is already battling spike in the cases.To this, Parida said that there will be two level of screening once these passengers land here. “First screening will be done at the airport and then our medical staff examine the passengers,” he said.“After suggestions from experts and city residents, we are thinking about making Covid-19 test mandatory for all NRIs,” said Parida.On date of arrival of the passengers, Parida said, “We will be informed two days in advance and accordingly will depute our resources to bring them here.”Earlier in the day, residents of Sectors 10 and 46 wrote to the UT administration, expressing their reservations against making Hotel Mountview and Ayurvedic hospital as quarantine facilities.

10-05-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab cabinet meet deferred after minister-chief secy face-off||A major showdown between Punjab ministers and bureaucrats over the state excise policy resulted in postponement of a crucial cabinet meeting to be chaired by chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Saturday.The meeting was deferred to Monday after all senior Congress ministers walked out over “abrupt remarks” made by chief secretary Karan Avtar Singh , according to the sources privy to the proceedings of the pre-Cabinet meet that was held at Punjab Bhawan here.The meeting that brought to the fore a simmering discord between the ruling party leaders and bureaucrats was a stormy affair from the word go.Technical education minister Charanjit Channi was the first to fire the salvo. “The new policy appears to be benefiting the contractors. While 70% of vends have been given to the existing contractors, there was no bidder for the remaining 30%. This could lead to decline in Rs 2,000 crore income from liquor this year. We are losing revenue every year. Who is responsible for this? Why can’t the responsibility of officers, who make such flawed policies, be fixed”, said Channi, as per a source who was present in the meeting.To this, the chief secretary gave a “curt” reply that policies are implemented only after the approval of the cabinet ministers and certain suggestions cannot be incorporated in the new policy, said the source. This prompted a sharp reaction from Manpreet who said “if the officers have already made up their mind on the policy, what was the fun of discussing the matter with the ministers?”Jails minister Sukhjinder Randhawa said the bureaucracy in Punjab was functioning as if there was a governor’s rule in the state, another source told HT.Channi went on to say, “Take me on record and register my comment that policies are being made by officers and you consult us only for the sake of approval”. After this, the ministers walked out. The unsavoury face-off sparked a flurry of reactions from Congress leaders, including known Amarinder-baiter and Rajya Sabha MP Partap Singh Bajwa.“Captain Amarinder Singh, I appreciate your efforts in trying to make the PM coordinate COVID activities with the CMs. It may help if you would offer the same courtesy to your own colleagues when it comes to affairs of Punjab,” he said.Amrinder Raja Warring, Congress MLA from Gidderbaha, said, “Respected Captain Amarinder ji! This type of behaviour by chief secretary, time and again, is unacceptable. He has regularly disregarded our cabinet ministers and their decisions. I request you to remove him from this post immediately.”Ludhiana Congress MP Ravneet Singh Bittu said, “Ministers walking out of pre-Cabinet meeting after argument with chief secretary is like judge walking out of court after an argument with advocate. If they found bureaucracy to be incompetent, they should have replaced the officers and not staged a walkout. Ministers walking out should resign for their incompetence as many others capable of handling work pressure are ready to replace them.”Besides the chief secretary, the meeting was attended by chief principal secretary to the chief minister,Suresh Kumar, and principal secretary to Amarinder, Tejvir Singh.The officers tried to persuade the ministers to attend the meeting but they decided to leave, skipping the post-meeting lunch at the venue.The others ministers present at the meeting were Vijay Inder Singhla, Balbir Sidhu, Tript Rajinder Bajwa, OP Soni, Brahm Mohindra and Aruna Chaudhary.No minister was available for comments. Karan Avtar Singh did not respond to HT’s text messages.When contacted, media adviser to chief minister Raveen Thukral refused to comment on the developments saying that he was not aware about any such issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-cabinet-meet-deferred-after-minister-chief-secy-face-off/story-Yli4IveDN9bIfAv5tcUNJJ.html

10-05-2020||City||Hizbul-backed narco-terror operative arrested in Sirsa||In a major catch, Ranjeet Singh Rana, alias Cheetah, who was wanted in the 532-kg heroin haul from Attari on the Indo-Pakistan border in June last year, was arrested in Haryana’s Sirsa town on Saturday.In a joint operation by the National Investigation Agency (NIA), Punjab Police and their Haryana counterpart, Rana, the kingpin of the drug racket, and his brother Gagandeep Singh, alias Bhola, were arrested from their hideout at Begu village in Sirsa.Punjab Police chief Dinkar Gupta said Ranjeet is one of the biggest drug smugglers of India.“Following up further on arrests of Hizbul operatives in J&K and Punjab, Punjab Police juggernaut moved further to nab Ranjeet of Amritsar, one of the biggest drug smugglers of India from Sirsa today,” Gupta tweeted.The Punjab Police said Ranjeet is a big fish in the ISI-controlled network linked with Hizbul Mujahideen commander Riaz Naikoo who was killed by security forces in Kashmir recently.With more than 10 criminal cases against him, Ranjeet was one of the key links in the network engaged in smuggling of large number of consignments of drugs and illegal weapons through the India-Pakistan border through the legal land route of Attari and also across the border fencing in Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir, police said.He had been convicted in 2008, 2009 and 2011 for heroin smuggling. He was awarded 12-year rigorous imprisonment for smuggling of 5 kg heroin, but was acquitted by the Supreme Court in March 2018 by giving him benefit of doubt. Giving details of the Sirsa operations, DGP Dinkar Gupta said he spoke to his Haryana counterpart Manoj Yadav at around 9 pm on Friday, and thereafter coordination was established by CP Amritsar with Sirsa SP Arun Nehra.HEROIN HIDDEN IN ROCK SALT CONSIGNMENTSRanjeet was wanted in smuggling of in 532kg heroin and 52 kg of mixed narcotics, worth over Rs 2700 crore, from Pakistan in a consignment of 600 bags of rock salt, through integrated checkpost (ICP), Attari (Amritsar) on June 29, 2019. The customs department had nabbed Tariq Ahmed Lone of Handwara (J&K) and Gurpinder Singh of Amritsar in this connection.Announcing Ranjeet and Gagandeep’s arrest, chief minister Captain Amarinder also congratulated the police force for the arrest of Hilal Ahmed Wagay, an overground worker of the Hizbul Mujahideen, who was arrested on April 25.Police said Ranjeet and Gagandeep were nabbed following interrogation of their cousins -- Bikram Singh, alias Vicky, and his brother Maninder Singh Mani -- who were arrested recently for allegedly handing over money to Hilal in Amritsar. According to the chief minister, Ranjeet is one of the most active nodal operatives of the extensive network of drug smugglers/couriers set up by the Pakistan spy agency Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) to push in composite consignments of drugs and weapons from Pakistan into Punjab through various means, including drones. STAYED AT BEGU VILLAGE FOR 8 MONTHSSirsa senior superintendent of police (SSP) Arun Nehra said, “Ranjeet has been living with his family in Begu village for the past eight months. He rented a room on the identification provided by his relative who belongs to Vaidwala village and has been identified as Gurmeet Singh, who is also wanted under the NDPS Act.”REMANDED IN 5-DAY POLICE CUSTODYRanjeet and Gagandeep were later brought to Amritsar, where they were presented before duty magistrate Arjun Singh by the police. The duty magistrate remanded them in five-day police custody.

Police said a special investigation team looking into the matter will question him about the involvement of other persons, including some traders, two former SHOs, some policemen and excise officials.The police also seized ₹97 lakh in cash, two pistols and three mobile phones besides a sports utility vehicle following a raid in a house to nab the prime accused. The two godowns in Sonepat from where a huge stock of liquor had reportedly gone missing early this week are stated to belong to accused Bhupinder’s wife. The raid was conducted two days after Haryana home minister Anil Vij questioned the rational of keeping seized liquors in “godowns, owned by a person (Bhupinder Singh), who is facing 8-10 cases of liquor smuggling”. Vij had also said a huge stock of seized liquor could not have gone missing from two godowns in Sonepat without the connivance of officials. According to the minister, 5,500 liquor boxes have gone missing from the Sonepat godown which was under the supervision of the police department.The other godown is being looked after by the state excise department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/missing-liquor-case-haryana-police-seize-97-lakh-cash-pistol-suv-in-raid/story-8W2Wz40O8szuRydDRzXDZL.html

The complete lockdown following the Covid-19 outbreak from March 23 to May 3 had exhausted his savings and compelled him to seek free ration.Kanojia’s calculations were wrong, with May 4 and 5 bringing no work. When he contacted his regulars they refused to hand over clothes for ironing, advising him to come back after the situation normalised.“People are wary of giving their clothes to dhobis for ironing, but it’s our only source of livelihood. I have no money left and without work I will be forced to depend on the mercy of others for a living,” says Ramu, 50, from Gonda in Uttar Pradesh, who settled in the city four decades back. “I charge around Rs 4 per garment and before the lockdown I was earning Rs 600 to Rs700 a day, after deducting the cost of coal. Because of this I can afford to educate my children. My elder son, who is in the final year of graduation, is also into theatre. But now things are going from bad to worse and I don’t know what the future holds for us,” adds Ramu, who lives in Sector 56.Not welcome in societies The scenario is bleak. “Since the curfew was lifted four days ago, I was expecting some work, but no one wants their clothes ironed. I live in Jagatpura and have been working in Sector 48 for the last one decade, but people there are wary of letting me into the society,” says Arvind Kumar, 31, who moved to the city from Bahraich village in Lucknow (Uttar Pradesh). “There are over 1,500 dhobis in Chandigarh and a majority of them are registered with the municipal corporation (MC), which means they have to pay a monthly fee of Rs 575 to Rs 1,575 depending on the sector where they work. We don’t know what new guidelines the administrations will come out with, or if the MC rental will be waived,” says Raghav Ram, 60, president of the Hindi Pressman Dhobi Parishad, the umbrella body of Chandigarh’s dhobis.No laundry from hotels, clubsThere are eight private dhobi ghats registered with the MC in the city, on which over 200 families are dependent. “Around 80% of the work in the ghats was coming from the hospitality industry — hotel linen, clubs, salons, tent houses — and walk-in customers. Now with the hospitality industry yet to open up and no one giving us clothes to launder all the dhobi ghats are without work,” says Ajay Kanojia, who is associated with the Sector 19 ghat and is the president of the Chandigarh Dhobi Maha Sabha.In 2008, MC upgraded the Sector 15 dhobi ghat under a pilot project, renaming it Modern Dhobi Ghat and charging a monthly rent for it. The 16 families who are members of the cooperative society of the ghat are now finding it difficult to pay the rent of Rs 13,800, including taxes. “Two days ago we got a call from MC office to deposit the rent pending for March and April by May 10. Were we doing regular business, paying the money would not have been a problem. But now things are bad. Yesterday we got only 13 clothing items to launder and today just one blanket was delivered,” says Vikas Deep, who works at the ghat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pressing-problems-for-dhobis-in-chandigarh-as-fear-of-covid-19-keeps-customers-away/story-CYBwsHZk2DnXBc5HelujCL.html

He added distribution of foodgrain to beneficiaries had been adversely affected due to this across the state, but particularly in Patiala cluster. In a release, Ashu said the department had raised the issue of the slow pace of delivery with the Union food and civil supplies ministry on April 30, 2020, as the state had by then only received 2,646 tonne of pulses against its allocation of 10,800 tonne under the NFSA and the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana (PMGKY). He added that the department had also written to the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India (NAFED), but the state had received 5,566 tonne of Urad till Friday night. The minister added that the Patiala cluster that includes Mohali, Rupnagar, Fatehgarh Sahib and Sangrur districts had received only 900 tonne pulses against its allocation of 2,189 tonne, with the last delivery received on May 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/centre-delaying-supply-of-pulses-to-punjab-says-punjab-minister-bharat-bhushan-ashu/story-kFXuBDe6soXk0pvUmSFznJ.html
10-05-2020||Chandigarh||MC works worth ₹400-crore approved for 2020-21 unlikely to be finished in Chandigarh||Lockdown has aggravated the financial difficulties of an already cash-starved Chandigarh municipal corporation.MC commissioner KK Yadav on Saturday told the Hindustan Times that the corporation was in no position to make funds available for capital works planned for this financial year. “Our internal resources have depleted due to the lockdown and we fear a 20% cut in the committed grant from the centre,” he said.Yadav said he will try to ask the UT administration if it could absorb the 20% cut at its own level and ensure the MC gets 100% grant approved by the Centre. “But in any case, large scale investment on development works is not possible this year since the MC’s overall revenue target may not be accomplished due to the slow down. On the other hand, committed liabilities are even higher than last year. Also, the MC has been spending a lot on special corona-related activities,” he added. He said ₹4 lakh alone were spent everyday to buy PPEs for staff working on emergency duties in containment zones and other places. The MC will barely manage to foot salaries, bills and other committed liabilities, for which ₹50 crore per month is required, he added. ₹400-CR WORKS AT STAKE MC’s 2020-21 budget cleared in February had outlined ₹443 crore for capital expenditure in which major focus was on roads, waste management, water storage capacity augmentation, better civic amenities in villages and changing of the defunct storm and sewerage lines. Sources said that except roadworks and some investment in waste management, none of the planned works will be achieved.“Road re-carpeting will be made possible because of a special grant that the UT had issued in March. It was a deposit work for which funds are kept in reserve. Work will begin as soon as the lockdown is over,” said an MC engineer on the condition of anonymity.He said in case the lockdown extended to June or July, the MC will not be able to make the roads because of the onset of the monsoon season. The only window left will be from September to December mid, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/mc-works-worth-400-crore-approved-for-2020-21-unlikely-to-be-finished-in-chandigarh/story-8vcTS7tEcfNCVuszqikUSM.html

10-05-2020||Chandigarh||Covid-19 cases in Chandigarh: Hallomajra and Maloya can be next Bapu Dham||Just like city’s major hotspot, Bapu Dham Colony, Chandigarh’s other villages, Hallomajra and Maloya, are congested too. With one case each and residents still flouting social-distancing norms, these villages could rapidly imitate the trends observed in Bapu Dham Colony.On Friday, a 35-year-old man from Hallomajra tested positive for Covid-19, two days after his death at Government Multi Specialty Hospital (GMSH), Sector 16. He was putting up alone in a rented accommodation and was a chronic alcoholic. He visited the hospital with symptoms, including loose stools, severe anaemia and disorientation. “His condition deteriorated and was put on ventilator. He was also suffering from severe pancytopenia. He tested positive for Covid-19,” reads an official statement. A total of 18 people living in the same building have been quarantined. Though no exact source could be pointed, but the official note said, “He has history of frequent visits to Bapu Dham Colony and he also stayed for five days at Bapu Dham Colony.”The lane that leads to the deceased house has been sealed. The houses there are so closely constructed that their top-floors almost touch one another. Social-distancing a distant dreamThe contact tracing team has quarantined over 55 people and no such movement can be observed there. However, the market situated just a few metres away from the house, was abuzz with activity. The shopkeepers in the market are not following the odd-even rule and most shops can be seen open. Residents could be seen walking in groups. While many had their faces covered, others were seen walking, standing clothes together, sans masks.With 106 cases and counting, Bapu Dham Colony, had turned into city’s major hotspot in no time. It all started on April 24 after an employee of the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) was found to be infected. He went on to infect five members of his family, and over a dozen people in the neighbourhood. The UT administration had hoped the virus doesn’t spread further, but every new case started a chain reaction of its own.Population density in the shantiesBharat Kumar, counsellor from ward number 23 that covers three villages, including Ram Darbar, Faidan and Hallomajra, said, “Hallomajra is quite a congested area, it has around 1,900 houses and over 80,000 people. In one room of these houses, up to five people stay. There are chawls where people have built 30-40 rooms in a row, with four-five people living in one room. Most of the residents are from the working class.”He said, “I keep inspecting the areas and the worrisome part is that people in these colonies villages are not following social distancing norms. The administration should take strict action, else there is no doubt that situation might go out of hand, imitating the Bapu Dham Colony incident.”One Covid-19 positive case in MaloyaMeanwile, in Maloya, a 20-year-old female tested positive for Covid-19. People in the entire building where she stay had been quarantined and police were deployed to control the situation. “The problem in Maloya is similar to Bapu Dham colony as the area is too congested and maintaining social distance is not possible,” said an MC official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hallomajra-and-maloya-can-be-next-chandigarh-s-bapu-dham/story-daom481ZxuAEfrwM3ZhjRO.html
10-05-2020||Chandigarh||Rent of working women hostel located on PGIMER campus increased three times amid lockdown||At a time when the government is pressing landlords in the city to not ask their tenants for rent, the monthly charges of the working women hostel (WWH) located on the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences and Research (PGIMER) campus in Sector 12 were increased threefold.If that’s not all, the hostellers are being charged an extra fine if they fail to pay the increased fee.Curiously, both PGIMER and the UT administration’s social welfare department have said that the hostel is not managed by them.Around 300 women, most of them research scholars, lab technicians or students involved in active Covid-19 duty, stay in the hostel. A lab technician, working in the Covid-19 ward, said that they can’t even shift amid the crisis nor can they pay the additional amount.After a hike of 10% in December 2019, the girls living in the hostels started paying ₹2,210 per person for a triple seater room, and ₹2,613 per person for a single room. After another hike in May, the rent was increased based on the income slabs ranging between ₹2,197 to ₹8,054. In addition to that, hostellers are also charged ₹732 as electricity and water charges along with ₹293 as maintenance charges. Those who want to use a cooler have to pay an additional ₹100 in summers.A research scholar from the department of community medicine, PGIMER, said, “On May 6, they put up a notice saying that the fee had been hiked for May. For me, the overall hostel payment has increased by almost three times, from ₹2,600 to ₹8,000. With mess and additional charges, it comes to around ₹11,000. Is such a steep hike amid a crisis justified?”The order released by the chairperson of the hostel management committee stated that the hostel charges were being revised based on the charges of Sector 24 WWH run by the social welfare department because of increased labour cost.PGIMER in a written statement said that the hostel did not come under its ambit, adding that all the WWHs were monitored by the UT director social welfare. However, secretary social welfare Yashpal Garg said the PGIMER WWH was not managed by the department.When contacted for comments, Sushmita Ghoshal, head of the department of radiotherapy, PGIMER, and the chairperson of the management committee of the hostel, refused to comment, and asked instead why the fee hike was being questioned at all.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/rent-of-working-women-hostel-located-on-pgimer-campus-increased-three-times-amid-lockdown/story-yS81kpeS9xgZJWZzDqYB3I.html

10-05-2020||Chandigarh||Court reserves order on ex-Punjab DGP Saini’s anticipatory bail plea||A Mohali court on Saturday reserved its order for Monday on the anticipatory bail application of former Punjab director general of police (DGP) Sumedh Singh Saini.Saini and six others were booked on Thursday in connection with the disappearance of a Mohali resident, Balwant Singh Multani, after a terrorist attack in 1991.“Why do you need custodial interrogation in the times of lockdown?” additional district and sessions judge Monika Goyal posted a query to district attorney Sanjeev Batra, who was opposing Saini’s anticipatory bail plea. In his reply, Batra said: “Saini’s custodial interrogation is needed to find out how Multani’s body was disposed of after he died of torture. “The prosecution also said that Saini may threaten witnesses and not cooperate with the investigation agency.While seeking anticipatory bail, Saini’s counsel APS Deol submitted: “They (police) registered an FIR to harass him (Saini) in the days of coronavirus.”“No one can be prosecuted for same offence twice. The Supreme Court had already quashed the FIR against Saini in the same case. So how can he be booked again?” argued advocate Deol, challenging registration of the FIR 29 years after the incident. Advocate Deol submitted: “Soon after his arrest, Multani was produced in a court in 1991 so there can be no case of abduction. Multani was son of an IAS officer but he never made any allegations of torture then.”Complainant’s counsel Pradeep Virk, however, said the Supreme Court had quashed the FIR on technical grounds with liberty to file fresh a case. ‘GURMEET PINKY TO BE EXAMINED AS WITNESS’In his bail plea, Saini said the very basis of the fresh FIR was mere heresy based on an interview of Gurmeet Singh, alias Pinky (a dismissed cop of Punjab Police) to a news magazine a few years ago.In the interview, Pinky had allegedly said that Multani was tortured in police custody leading to his death. His body was disposed of later, Pinky had alleged. Batra told the court that Pinky will be examined as a witness in this case. However, advocate Deol pointed out that police had not examined Pinky or taken any action against him after his comments published in the magazine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/court-reserves-order-on-ex-punjab-dgp-saini-s-anticipatory-bail-plea/story-HFbMTlNhanEayLBXUzJM9K.html

The spurt in numbers is because drugs are unavailable. The second van in the project was launched on Saturday. The project itself was launched on April 14 with one van deputed to deliver medicine and enrol new patients.To date, the first van, that visits localities four days a week, has registered 300 patients. The second van will go door-to-door three days a week. The detailed schedule is drawn up in consultation with local experts. The second van is also equipped to conduct HIV tests on patients, offer expert consultation and screen addicts. “HIV tests are important as there are previous past instances of addicts using the same syringe to inject themselves. Curfew might have brought in some disruption in their medicine supply schedule,” said a doctor, on condition of anonymity. “The lockdown could be a blessing for drug addicts, as many have themselves come forward to enroll for de-addiction. Even as social distancing is being maintained at our centre, this new van will augment our capacity and visit affected areas three times a week,” said Dr Sandeep Bhola, nodal officer, mental health and de-addiction centres of Kapurthala.Bhola added they were taking the help of sarpanches and NGOs to identify addicts in their areas and get them treated at the van. The number of addicts at centres across the district has seen a spike from 30-50 admission per month to over 200, with drugs not available.

It will even affect lungs of children making them prone to the infection,” the CM said while addressing the farmers in a video message.As many as 722 cases of stubble burning were reported on Thursday, followed by 664 on Friday and 545 on Saturday. It took the season’s total to 2,160.Balbir Singh Rajewal, president of Bharatiya Kisan Union (Rajewal) also asked farmers to desist from stubble burning, saying it does not help anyone, but only endangers lives. “We fail to understand why there is rise in the number of farm cases this season. We were expecting farmers to understand the situation this season, but they haven’t,” said Krunesh Garg, member secretary Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB). He said it is difficult to take action against the errant farmers as there are only 40 engineers with the board. “We challaned 39 farmers today and have imposed a fine of Rs 1.07 lakh,” he said adding that the revenue department would start making red entries into the land record of errant farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/after-spurt-in-farm-fires-punjab-cm-asks-farmers-to-stop-stubble-burning/story-D7hNx1XsbTWtG08NpeeFbL.html

However, acceding to the farmers’ demand, he decided to advance it by three more days.The sowing operations will now commence on May 10, instead of May 20, with setting up of nurseries and transplantation of saplings from June 10, fixed earlier by the agriculture department.The farmers had raised concerns about meeting the cultivation and sowing requirements in view of the labour shortage resulting from exodus of migrant labourers in view of the Covid-19 crisis.Describing these concerns as understandable, the CM said it is in the interest of the farmers to push the dates ahead by 10 days. Underlining the need to adopt the latest practice of direct seeding of rice (DSR) and mechanised paddy transplantation technologies, the CM directed additional chief secretary ACS (development) Viswajeet Khanna to harness the services of the extension staff of agriculture department to provide all technical support to the farmers.The farmers should be helped in making effective use of paddy transplanters and DSR machinery, he said, adding that the advanced technology would be instrumental in filling the gap created by shortage of migrant labour.To facilitate the farmers in ensuring timely transplantation of paddy, Amarinder also directed the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) to make necessary arrangements for facilitating uninterrupted power supply to the agriculture sector during this period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/now-paddy-transplantation-in-punjab-advanced-by-10-days/story-VeCHZ9yOqFTOlfxFch4yaK.html

BJP corporator Sanjay Waghule said, “We were not showed any plan of the hospital nor given any estimate of funds. We had already given money to the CM’s Relief Fund. The mayor decided on his own that all corporators will pay ₹5 lakh. We were not called for the meeting to decide this.”Waghule said they suggested TMC uses the ₹150 crore allotted for Aapla Dawakhana (Moholla clinic) project. “Why is the Sena reluctant to use this fund?” he said. The Sena refuted the claim that there was any foul play in the project. Mhaske said, “We all decided in the common corporators group to contribute for the hospital. If the BJP does not want to contribute, it is their choice. They do not have to politicise the issue.”He said the hospital is an emergency project and there is no time for tenders. “We will have to float an emergency tender for the hospital. Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s corporators had given funds in Mumbai and we decided to do the same,” said Mhaske.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bjp-corporators-in-thane-refuse-to-contribute-for-covid-hospital/story-8TahYOGcBISniZeXo33vDO.html

On Saturday later at night, the railways operated a train for migrant workers from CSMT to Basti in Uttar Pradesh.“Trains towards Uttar Pradesh and Bihar are being operated from the city. The state government informs on the destination and the departing railway stations, following which we run the trains,” said a senior Central Railway (CR) official. Meanwhile, a train ferrying migrant workers to Barauni in Bihar left from Thane on Saturday at 2.50pm, while some labourers from Odisha left from Panvel railway station to Titlagarh station. “The train departed from Thane station with 1,200 passengers who followed all rules of social distancing and sanitisation,” said a senior official from CR, Mumbai. This is the second Shramik train from Thane to Bihar. On Thursday, a train had left with migrants to Bapudham Motihari. “The train on Saturday mostly had passengers from Mumbra and Daighar. The previous train had the passengers from Thane,” said a railway official from Thane. Meanwhile, some migrants in Navi Mumbai, who have opted to stay back, have alleged that they have not been getting any provisions or food as officials are busy in making arrangements to send labourers back home.“Our stock of food grains and other essential have got.

He hopes to construction activity will start soon.“For a month, we survived on savings. But that soon dried up. The civic body was helping till now but off late they have stopped. Now, we are depending on the NGO,” said Prasad, who lives with his wife and brother.Pritima Husna, 29, from Bengal, who used to work as house help, lives in Kamothe with her husband, brother-in-law and parents-in-law.“We got some help from the government but we want to go back home.

After the government started sending migrants home, more people are calling us for food and essentials,” said Nagkar.Some like Sonkar Lal, 36, from Jharkhand have decided to stay back, hoping the situation improves soon.“Going home is a hassle and staying back is also a problem. If officials stop looking at our needs, how will we survive?” said Sonkar Lal, 36, who he used to work as an electrician.He lives in Kamothe with his wife, five-year-old daughter and his younger brother. Jamir Lengarekar, additional commissioner, Panvel City Municipal Corporation (PCMC), said that those who are staying back are not inconvenienced.“We have appointed an official to look after the requirement of the migrants and distribute essentials.

It is an everyday battle for us to keep the infection at bay,” said Lav Agarwal, health ministry joint secretary, in a briefing on Friday.Authorities are now focusing on 10 states that account for the most number of cases. “The ministry of health and family welfare has decided to deploy Central teams to 10 states that have witnessed/are witnessing high case load and high spurt of cases. The teams will assist state health departments of respective states to facilitate management of the outbreak,” health ministry said in a statement on Saturday.The expert teams consist of a senior official from the health ministry, a joint secretary-level nodal officer, and a public health expert. The states where the teams are being sent are Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.The outbreak in India began on March 2 and by the end of the month, the country was under a sweeping lockdown that helped avert a situation in several populous countries where tens of thousands have now died.But pressure to relax the curbs are now growing, with large number of people having lost their livelihoods – especially people from lower economic groups such as factory workers and daily wage earners who have been walking in the thousands to their hometowns hundreds of kilometers away.In Uttar Pradesh, the government estimated that more than 100,000 people who were in other states for work were scheduled to return by Saturday night after the government started special trains. Another 98 trains will reach the state on Sunday and Monday, according to the official.The movement has also raised fears of infections growing as the tens of thousands taking the trains come in potential contact that could spread the virus.Similar concerns also surround Indians returning from abroad. On Saturday, at least two foreign returnees who reached Kerala on May 7 in two separate first-day flights -- one from Dubai and another from Abu Dhabi – tested positive for the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maha-s-covid-case-count-hits-20-000-india-crosses-60-000/story-Ouf9lnvVLTYk2o58EdZw5K.html

Sheela Foam Limited (Udyog Vihar) has been asked to provide the emergency plan as it uses excessive amount of chlorine and other poisonous gases,” he said.He further said all hazardous factories have been asked to store inflammable and poisonous gases away from work places as per the stipulated safety norms to maintain a material data safety sheet in factories. “All the hazardous factories will have to always display the dos and don’ts regarding handling of inflammable and poisonous gases being used or stored by them. These factories have also been asked to follow the stipulated safety norms while transporting these inflammable and poisonous gases,” he said.The DM also said these factories have been asked to prepare a disaster management plan for emergencies. “These factories have been asked to submit their respective plans to the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) and assistant director (factories) offices in the district,” he said.When contacted, public relation officer of NTPC Dadri said they will follow the guidelines issued by the district administration. “Strict compliance of government order is the prime duty of corporates in the time of a pandemic. However, we are always committed to maintaining all safety norms at NTPC plants,” the spokesperson said.The other factories were not available for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/keep-poisonous-chemicals-away-from-workplaces-gb-nagar-district-admin-warns-factories/story-WOLCm6htWAyLqV3grD2meL.html
10-05-2020||Noida||Air India crew engaged in Vande Bharat mission will stay in Delhi hotel till test results come||A day after the Noida police requested Air India to quarantine in Delhi its Noida-based crew members involved in the evacuation of Indian citizens stranded in different countries due to coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, the city police Saturday said the airline has agreed to do so. The crew members will now be quarantined in a hotel in Delhi till their Covid-19 test reports come. If their test reports are negative, they can return to their residences in Gautam Budh Nagar.Noida police commissioner Alok Singh said this is a consensus decision taken in consultation with Uttar Pradesh chief secretary, the Noida district administration and the Noida authority. “We have received information that there are about 25 pilots and 40 service staff of Air India living in Gautam Budh Nagar. They may join the international flights being operated to evacuate Indian citizens stranded abroad. Once the evacuation is over, these crew members will be kept in a hotel in Delhi for a few days till their medical reports come. Once the report is negative, they can come to their homes in Noida. This is a fair decision,” he said. Noida health department will again test these crew members on the fifth day of their arrival for safety purposes.On Friday, Noida police had requested the national carrier to quarantine the crew members in Delhi, in order to check the spread of the virus in Gautam Budh Nagar. The Noida police said the ministry of home affairs had issued a standard operating procedure (SOP) on May 5, regarding evacuation of people stranded in foreign countries, and also foreign nationals stranded in India.“We requested the management of the national carrier to keep these crew members in institutional quarantine in Delhi. We have received Air India’s response and they have agreed to do this. Accordingly, the crew members would commute between Noida and Delhi,” Sriparna Gongulee, additional commissioner of police, Gautam Budh Nagar, said.India has planned to send 60 flights spread over a week to bring back hundreds of its citizens stranded in different countries. Air India could not be reached for comment on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/air-india-crew-engaged-in-vande-bharat-mission-will-stay-in-delhi-hotel-till-test-results/story-Gin7r4f4RKPY6DH6DMVPdJ.html

10-05-2020||Delhi||Delhi asks Bihar to reimburse Rs 6.5 lakh for migrants’ travel||A Delhi government letter seeking reimbursement of Rs 6.5 lakh spent on sending around 1,100 migrants from the national capital to their native Bihar on a special train on Friday has triggered a row. In a letter in response to the demand, Bihar’s disaster management department principal secretary Pratyaya Amrit on Saturday cited clause 11 (c) of the railways guidelines issued on May 2 saying the “local state government authority shall handover the tickets to the passengers cleared by them and collect the ticket fare and handover the total amount to railways”. “The decision of the GNCTD [government of the National Capital Territory of Delhi] in making payments for buying bulk tickets for all passengers and then to seek reimbursement from Government of Bihar (GoB) is in violation of the aforesaid guidelines issued by the Ministry of Railways,” said Amrit.Amrit’s letter came in response to that of Delhi government’s nodal officer PK Gupta seeking the reimbursement for the transportation of the migrants, who arrived in Muzaffarpur on Saturday. He said the Bihar government has a policy of reimbursing the railway fares paid by migrant labourers on arrival in the state. “In consonance with this policy, we shall reimburse the fare to the railway passengers and not to the GNCTD,” the letter said. HT has seen copies of both letters.Gopal Rai, Delhi’s labour minister, acknowledged they had written to the Bihar government on May 7 seeking the reimbursement. He added since there was no response to their letter, the Delhi government paid the railways Rs 6.5 lakh to send the migrant workers back home. “We had sent a similar letter to Madhya Pradesh and it responded and paid the cost for the first train that went from Delhi.”Delhi’s ruling Aam Aadmi Party spokesman Sanjay Singh said the railways runs these special trains after the fares are paid but the Bihar government wants workers to come first and pay later. He said the Delhi government said it will not allow the workers to pay money and hence paid the railways. “Who are you trying to fool [Bihar chief minister] Nitish Kumar and BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party]?” Singh tweeted.Tens of thousands of migrant workers from states like Bihar have been stranded in Delhi since the lockdown to check the Covid-19 spread was imposed on March 25. The railways last week began running special trains for the people stranded because of the lockdown. As per the Centre’s guidelines, either a state where a special train originates from or the one where it terminates has to bear 15% cost of a ticket. The Centre will take care of the remaining 85% of the sleeper class rates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-asks-bihar-to-reimburse-6-5-lakh-for-migrants-travel/story-6UFkzAPlsdcUoE4hwJ6kWI.html
10-05-2020||Gurugram||Number of cases increasing in Gurugram due to more testing, say officials||The number of Covid-19 cases in Gurugram doubled in the last week, with addition of at least 71 cases between May 1 and May 8. The district at present has a total to 142 cases.Between May 1 and May 8, Gurugram’s doubling time decreased from 36 days to around 7 days, according to government data.The doubling rate of an infectious disease is a temporal indicator. It estimates the number of days that it will take for the total number of cases to double. The lesser the number of days it takes for cases to double, the higher the doubling rate. In Haryana, the cumulative number of Covid-19 cases is doubling every eight days — as opposed to every 24 days, which was the rate two weeks ago. Health officials say that this acceleration is due to an increase in targeted sampling and RT-PCR testing of both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Officials also said that, given the surge in Haryana and in Gurugram, and to check the spillover of infection from adjoining Delhi and Punjab, testing numbers are only going to be ramped up in coming days. Data shows that the growth rate of Covid-19 cases in Gurugram was slow till April 30. Till March 31, cumulative Covid-19 cases in Gurugram were 24. It increased to 46 on April 8. No new case was reported for the next 10 days. The number gradually increased to 61 on April 24 and further to 71 on May 1. “The growth rate was slow, so the cases were multiplying after every 36 days. In last one week, cases have suddenly increased from 71 to 140. It is the highest spike so far, bringing down the doubling rate to 7.2 days,” said Ashok Meena, officer in-charge for state’s Covid-19 data, and CEO of Ayushman Bharat and commissioner Food and Drugs department.Gurugram was one of the first districts in Haryana to report a case of the virus. On March 4, a Paytm employee had tested positive for Covid-19. Cases that were reported thereafter, were largely traced back to overseas travels or people having come in contact with Tablighi Jamaat attendees. Data shows Covid-19 cases were multiplying in 18 days at that time.Meena said, “To calculate the doubling rate we take seven days average. It includes a mathematical calculation called Cumulative Annual Growth Rate (CAGR), where we take average of Covid-19 cases reported in the last seven days. It can be calculated every day, also every three days or five days. But it is the Central government’s mandate to calculate the doubling rate after every seven days. It is a dynamic process and therefore the rate changes every week.”Dr Rajesh Kumar, epidemiologist and former professor at the department of community medicine, PGIMS Chandigarh, explained that the doubling rate is related to the disease’s basic reproduction number, or R0. “For Covid-19, the basic reproduction number is supposed to be something between 1.5 to 3.5, meaning that one infected person will infect between 1.5 to 3.5 others. If the doubling rate is accelerating, it means that public health interventions have not reigned in the spread of the virus. The R0 may not be decreasing,” Kumar said. For India, the R0 value as calculated on May 9 was 1.27.STATE’S DOUBLING RATE Government data shows that in Haryana, till April 17 the doubling time was 24 days. From 275 cases in the third week of April, the count of persons infected with Covid-19 reached 357 on May 1, bringing down the doubling time to 18 days.The largest spike in Covid-19 cases was noticed between May 1 till May 8. From 357 cases,the number of positives count shot up to 647.“This sudden spurt in the number of cases further reduced the doubling time to eight days. Cases were being reported from districts like Jhajjar, Sonepat and Panipat, which barely had any cases earlier,” said Meena.He added, “Most of these cases have links with Delhi and other districts. It includes vegetable sellers who had links with Delhi’s Azadpur mandi, police personnel, health workers and Nanded pilgrims from Punjab. Therefore, to break the chain of transmission we are testing both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases now, which is why the numbers are increasing,” said Meena.A senior official in Haryana’s Integrated Diseases Surveillance Program, requesting anonymity said, “The accelerating rate could also mean that presymptomatic cases, which were going undetected earlier, are now showing signs of illness,” the official said.According to experts, it is a step in the right direction when it takes more days for the number of cases to double (if combined with an increase in testing numbers, and widening of testing criteria).However, if the window becomes shorter, it could mean that transmission was still happening. However, the senior IDSP official said that Haryana’s increasing doubling rate is merely a result of more targeted testing. “Our surveillance is becoming more efficient at finding and testing the right people, so naturally the cases will go up, and impact the doubling rate,” they said.The official also said that, just like Punjab, Haryana too was responding to the recent spike in cases by ramping up testing numbers. “If there is a surge in cases, it means that we need to keep increasing the number of tests until the daily percentage of positives starts to decline once again. Until then, we cannot be lax on testing.”Weekly data, however, shows that numbers have not significantly been ramped up. Between April 17 and April 23, Gurugram tested 1,525 samples. The following week (between April 24 and April 30), the district tested 1,719 samples, a slight increase. Between May 1 and May 7, the testing numbers recorded a decline, with just 1,487 samples tested.However, in the last two days, Gurugram had tested 558 samples, with the numbers expected to increase in the next five days, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/number-of-cases-increasing-due-to-more-testing-say-officials/story-CUttRWsiZRJzoHAIa4WGlM.html
10-05-2020||City||Random forays: New education paradigms are in the offing||The world may or may not change drastically, regardless of what soothsayers and wannabe pundits have been averring these days, but education systems will certainly find it necessary to don new avatars, globally.Education at the school level in India has often been branded as archaic, rote learning driven and over dependent on the traditional marks system. Not without reason. It is a fact that our schools have not really encouraged sports and creativity in the manner that many Asian and western schools do. We grew up while largely learning to cram stuff, although some of our friends would certainly display sparks of brilliance despite the system.Nowadays, despite the breakneck speed with which parents tug their wards to tuitions and karate- coaching, hoping to make them all-rounders in some sense, the unidimensional learning model has not really altered. Our schools and colleges do not by and large focus on social emotional learning, creative pursuits and analytical skills for their students. Thus the industry finds that young hopefuls who turn up for interviews are very good at mathematical deduction but unable to carry out a conversation of substance with people from unfamiliar backgrounds.Therefore, the need to grab the opportunity which this virus enabled global lockdown has triggered and overhaul a few of our educational paradigms is pressing. Teachers across the land are already learning to perform before cameras, much like TV stars, and their camera shyness has necessarily been overshadowed by school diktats to get busy with online classes. Some of these teachers are feeling the pinch in many ways, what with parents joining in the online sessions, albeit surreptitiously, and students often wandering away, unnoticed, when their parents are not looking.The online world has its pitfalls, of course, and despite being a technologist of some sorts, I have always been a votary of the classroom experience. The whole aura of being a part of a large group of students and growing up rubbing shoulders with peers is unmatched and even vital. A teacher’s stern look or appreciative smile cannot be replicated online and the resultant cringe or glow on the student’s face would surely go unnoticed, anyway!Yet, blended learning will stay the course, with online modules making their presence increasingly felt even when things such as masks and sanitisers finally recede into the background, which they surely will. Blending the classroom method with online learning is the future and with enhanced software facilities as well as superior bandwidth and webinar technologies here to stay, we cannot just wish them away.Also vital will be the need for schools and colleges to adapt to the need for minimising the emphasis on rote learning and marks. There has to be a renewed focus on project work, research work and creative writing, as well as enhanced oratorical skills. The finer points of human skills and qualities will have to be imbibed by young students from an early age, if the education system is indeed overhauled in this manner.Sports too has to remain an integral part of the plan and an hour of outdoor sport should actually be compulsory for all young people of our country, to enable them to sleep on time and stay off their smart phones, well past bedtime!Teachers and educationists need not worry though. Their basic skills will go a long way in carrying them forward in the new era too. When computers came into being it was thought that thousands would lose jobs. That never happened. The world changed and modified its ways. The same will happen, going forward.The new normal is not a term I like much, and actor Boman Irani espoused similar views in a webinar recently. What is going to change is the way we tackle challenges and the way we do certain things.Human experiences would not alter as much as we think. Let us hope that our kids can grow up in an environment of camaraderie and bonhomie, just as we did with our friends. And let us hope that the added element of creative thinking is a part of their school lives too.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/random-forays-new-education-paradigms-are-in-the-offing/story-SrrKztWWwhXKK6lgaZkpbN.html
10-05-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt pulls up private lab for ‘mismatch’ in Covid-19 testing data||The Delhi government has initiated an inquiry against a private pathological laboratory, Dr Lal PathLab, over alleged discrepancies in Covid-19 test reports. The laboratory accounts for three of the 13 approved private labs for Covid-19 testing in Delhi.Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain on Saturday confirmed that an inquiry committee, headed by the special secretary (health and family welfare), has been constituted to investigate the alleged discrepancies.“There was a mismatch in some test data provided by Dr Lal PathLab. So, an inquiry committee has been set up to find out the issues and to fix accountability. The committee comprises of doctors,” Jain said, in an address to media persons on Saturday.Responding to the Delhi government’s inquiry, Dr Arvind Lal, owner, Lal PathLabs said, “We have received a communication from the Delhi government and we are providing full cooperation.”Among the private labs, Dr Lal PathLab has the highest capacity to test Covid-19 samples, according to the government’s assessment. The company has three testing facilities for performing real-time RT-PCR Covid-19 tests, which together have a capacity of testing 4,000 samples a day. These three labs are located in north, northeast and northwest Delhi.The inquiry comes at a time when the Delhi government is facing a problem of delayed test results. As per government reports, which was last updated on Friday, results of as many as 4,262 tests were still awaited till May 7.It was only from Friday that the Delhi government began tightening the screw on testing laboratories. The government issued orders to all private testing labs to release test results within 24 hours of collecting the samples. In case results are not submitted within 48 hours, then the payment for the samples tested will not be made, the order stated.The Delhi government pays the private Covid-19 labs either Rs 4,500 per test (if both sample collection and test kits are provided by them) or ₹3,500 (if the sample is collected by the government and test kit is provided by the private lab). This amount is paid from the Covid funds released by the Central government to Delhi.It also mandated that “no testing lab shall collect sample more than 10% of its declared capacity, as overcrowding of samples leads to inordinate delays”.Earlier in the day, the health minister has said that his department will soon start issuing notices to testing facilities over delays in report submission and discrepancies, if any.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/dr-lal-pathlabs-pulled-up-over-discrepancies-in-testing/story-myhkpyYzC0MQlD0OOvX4LK.html

The helpline would be formally launched on Monday. At least 4,000 police personnel have been on continuous curfew duty since March 23 and most of them have been clocking 12 to 15 hours a day, deputy commissioner of police (DCP, headquarters) Akhil Chaudhary said. Some of the personnel have not met their families in a long while as they live in other districts, the DCP added.“The psychologist will communicate with the police personnel over phone, WhatsApp, social networking sites and give them tips on how to maintain their mental health. The psychologists would also hold sessions for police personnel,” he added. “For their physical health, we are providing them food, fruits, multi vitamins and medicines regularly. Mobile medical vans are providing regular health checkups to the police personnel,” the DCP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-police-to-launch-helpline-for-cops-in-stress/story-CKkPtltbaKwQxBXPK6C6tM.html
10-05-2020||Delhi||After cop dies of Covid-19, Delhi Police issue guidelines to stem spread||Concerned over the rise in positive coronavirus (Covid-19) disease cases in the force, the Delhi Police have issued a standard operating procedure (SOP) for daily health monitoring of personnel to ensure timely prevention and protection from the virus.According to the SOP, any police personnel feeling unwell, suffering from cough, sore throat, fever, breathlessness or any other symptoms “must immediately report” the same to the duty officer (DO) of the police station or unit where they are posted “by any means of communication”. The duty officers have been appointed as “daily health monitoring” officers. They have been tasked with updating the health status of personnel who say they are unwell. The updates should immediately be brought to the notice of the station house officer (SHO) of the police stations or heads of the units concerned, the SOP adds.According to an officer with direct knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be named, as many as 118 Delhi Police officials had tested positive for Covid-19 till Friday. At least 15 Delhi police personnel have recovered and resumed duty. the officer cited above added.The virus has already claimed the life of a 31-year-old constable who was posted at the Bharat Nagar police station.According to the minutes of a meeting held Friday, at least fourteen more Covid-19 positive cases of delhi police personnel were reported.From managing containment zones, guarding quarantine centres, feeding the homeless and the migrant workers to ensuring citizens maintain social distancing, the city police are on the frontlines in the fight against Covid-19. The SOP, Delhi Police commissioner SN Shrivastava said, lays down guidelines that SHOs or heads of units have to follow when they are informed about any personnel suspected to be positive for the Sars-Cov-2.“The unit head will immediately take the police person to a doctor and get their opinion as to whether they require a Covid-19 test, hospitalisation, or can be sent into home-quarantine or isolation, depending on their symptoms. The officer will get the testing done, inform the police person’s family about their health, and shall maintain a daily follow-up on them until their discharge from the hospital,” Shrivastava said in the SOP order.Monitored by a special commissioner rank officer, the WhatsApp groups record the health updates of Delhi Police personnel and their families.The heads of the units have been directed relay information on the staff helpline number -- 011-20818056 -- about the Covid-19 positive personnel to add them in the “Let’s Fight Covid-DP” and “Let’s Fight Covid-Family” WhatsApp groups so that the welfare of the personnel and their families can be “effectively tracked.”Seven hospitals – Lok Nayak, Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality, Ram Manohar Lohia, Safdarjung, AIIMS, Deen Dayal Upadhyay, and Apollo – have been mentioned in Shrivastava’s SOP order, where any police personnel feeling unwell can be admitted to for Covid-19 testing and emergency facilities.The police post (chowki) in-charges at the hospitals have been directed to respond quickly to any such medical emergencies, irrespective of jurisdiction limitations. The SOP directive adds that the contact numbers of the chowki incharges of the hospitals are to be displayed at the duty officers’ desks at the police station and units, as well as at other areas.Each hospital has a police chowki to address medico-legal cases referred to it or emergency cases brought in.Since asymptomatic cases are also increasing and doctors advise such patients to remain in quarantine at home, the city police have also arranged a quarantine facility in central Delhi where they can be kept instead of allowing them to live with their families and risk their lives as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-police-issues-sops-amid-rise-in-number-of-covid-19-cases-among-personnel/story-8pvU1FGGLFtUM3OMIDN2tM.html
10-05-2020||Delhi||Over 475,000 online liquor tokens issued in Delhi but glitches persist||The Delhi government has issued 475,000 e-tokens since Thursday evening for the sale of liquor at 172 outlets across the city. Stores, however, continued to attract heavy crowd with a number of people complaining that they were not able to access the web link -- www.qtoken.in -- launched by the government to ensure that social distancing norms are maintained during the sale. The rush also forced the excise department to issue a fresh order Friday night, clarifying that even those who do not have e-tokens will be allowed to purchase alcohol from the vends. On Friday, at many places across the city, people who stood in queue for hours were not sold liquor because they did not have the electronic token. The e-token system was introduced after reports of massive crowds gathering outside vends, violating the social distancing norms set by the government to contain the spread of Covid-19. Delhi has 864 liquor shops, of which only 172 have received permission to reopen so far, as they are ‘stand-alone shops’—which means they are not located in markets, malls and commercial spaces, which the central government guidelines prohibit in the red zone districts. The sale of liquor is allowed from 9 am to 6:30 pm and the government is issuing 50 tokens in one hour slots.Scores complained that the webpage was showing ‘server error (500)’. For those who managed to get through the website, there was still no luck as the message - ‘Sorry. Could not find any open slots at this shop. Please try some other shop’ - stared back from their mobile screens. “I tried 13 stores mentioned in the drop box, but got the same message for all. I put an alarm for 3am to wake up and try, and then finally I managed to get a slot for Saturday at the shop on the Ghazipur main road in east Delhi. I did not know that the Delhi government also allots a time slot in the token. My slot was between 10:30am and 11am,” said Manpreet Baweja, a resident of Mayur Vihar Phase III. Officials said e-tokens are being issued for slots maximum till the next two days every day.On Saturday, almost all shops also introduced paper token systems for those not having e-tokens. “We have deployed a marshal as well. The paper token system helps in case the queues break for some reason. It prevents tussles,” said a senior official on condition of anonymity. People willing to get e-token can apply through a web link www.qtoken.in where they are required to fill personal details such as an ID card option, the number of the ID card, name, phone number and then choose from the dropbox the available liquor vends.Once the token is issued, the person needs to visit the selected vend at the given time slot. The barcode in the token is only for verification purpose and not for direct purchase of liquor online. One will have to physically go to the store, choose the alcohol and pay the money at the store. The Delhi government is also working on setting up another web page—and deliberating on creating a mobile​phone application—to enable home delivery of liquor in the Capital, as a measure to reduce the massive crowds outside the limited number of reopened liquor shops. At many places across the city earlier this week, police had to resort to lathicharge to disperse the gathering outside vends. “We are drafting a standard operating protocol. So far, the excise department has had three meetings on this with the chief secretary and at least one with the finance minister (Manish Sisodia),” a senior government official said on Friday.Late on Friday evening, the state excise department also issued an order informing the Delhi Police and all district administrators that “two separate queues at each vend should be maintained”. One, for those with e-tokens and the other for customers without e-tokens.“It is directed to ensure that shops not having token system should also operate and that no person without e-token be denied liquor for the reason of not having e-token. However, preference to the persons having e-tokens must be given by forming separate queues,” the order issued by deputy commissioner (excise) Sandeep Mishra stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/475-000-e-tokens-for-liquor-issued-rush-at-shops-continues/story-GG7QpsqkdI24tfTQ8WS5JM.html
10-05-2020||City||Roundabout: Ray of hope for Indian cinema||Cinema lovers in Chandigarh pick their choice of the best films of the all-time great Indian filmmaker Satyajit Ray to mark the advent of his centenary celebrations in 2021Many greats have given Indian cinema their hearts and souls, yet it is Satyajit Ray (May2, 1921- April 23, 1992) nurtured by the Bengal renaissance, who remains the revered Indian cultural icon both at home and abroad. Interestingly, the Ray journey coincides in time with the coming up of the city of Chandigarh in the post-Independence India of the 1950s. Many of the city-bred did not get to see Ray’s films till as late as the 1970s and 1980s and that too courtesy the film appreciation courses and the city’s Film Society. Now, with his birth anniversary just gone by, a few city film connoisseurs pick out their favourites from the filmmaker’s legacy of 36 classics in different genres as a mark of remembrance.PATHER PANCHALI (1955): RANI BALBIR KAURTheatre and television actor-director veteran Rani starts at the very beginning to talk about the first film Ray made. “I grew up in the young city of Chandigarh and Ray’s films were not screened in cinema halls here, which catered to mainstream Hindi and some Punjabi films,” she recalls. It was not until the early 1970s that she saw Pather Panchali (The Song of the Road) when it was screened in Panjab University as part of a film appreciation course, organised by the Film and Television Institute of India in Pune.Rani says that the film had a great impact on her with the poignant story of a brother and sister of a poor home in the Bengal countryside which sees the death of Durga and the consequent migration of the family from the village to the city.She confesses, “Even if I were to see the film today, I would be just as moved. How well Ray translated the novel by famed Bengali author Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay into a visual symphony! I still return to the memory of the children running across the fields to see the train!”The film, Rani feels, was Ray’s launching pad, that won a phenomenal number of awards at home and abroad, establishing him as a meaningful filmmaker. And he kept the promise right through his career.Rubbishing criticism that Ray ‘exported India’s poverty,’ she says he was a realistic filmmaker who could tell a story most powerfully from his own milieu.JALSAGHAR(1958): AJAY BHATIAThe city cinema connoisseur, who has watched and rewatched Ray’s films with a keen eye, finds Jalsaghar (The Music Room) to be the most outstanding. Ajay says, “This was Ray’s fourth film based on a Bengali short story by Tarashankar Bandhyopadhyay and one would rate it as a neo-classic chronicle of the decline of the Bengal feudal landed aristocracy told with such lyricism and melancholy!” Interestingly, Tarashankar’s Partition novel Meghe Dhaka Tara (The Cloud-Capped Star) was to become one of the most appreciated films directed by Ray’s contemporary and to some extent his ideological opponent Ritwik Ghatak.On Ray’s excellent choices, Ajay refers to Chhabi Biswas, a talented theatre actor who was to feature in several of his films to finally portray the Kabuliwala in Tapan Sinha’s 1957 Bangla film based on Rabindranath Tagore’s classic story. He says: “Chhabi acted the tragic hero (in Jalsaghar) of trying to keep intact the prestige of the family with the final concert of music and dance even when the wealth of the family is gone.” The film had a great assemblage of musicians and dancers onstage and backstage. “Who can forget Begum Akhtar singing, Roshan Kumari dancing the Kathak and great musicians such as Ustad Waheed Khan and Bismillah Khan in accompaniment?” asks Ajay. CHARULATA (1964): VIJAYA SINGHThe master filmmaker described Charulata, based on Rabindranath Tagore’s novella Nastanirh (The Broken Nest) as his favourite film. City film studies scholar Vijaya Singh echoes the sentiment, saying, “I saw Charulata some two decades ago and I can see it many times over because it holds your attention right through the family drama with the wife, her husband and his cousin to whom she gives her heart. Madhabi Mukherjee, whom Ray cherished as an actor, played the role of a cultured and talented Bengali woman in the late 19th century seeking genuine love and understanding with a man.The period was created with a fine sense of detail and it was a lyrical film including the tragedy of love and betrayal of the new woman. Vijaya concludes, “The way the camera moves on her as Ray creates a feminist in pre-feminist times is amazing. It is not just a sentimental story of a woman seeking love but of her angst too as someone who knows her own worth being belittled thus. It is a film that was to pave the way for the new woman wanting a more equal relationship with a man!” SHATRANJ KE KHILADI (1977): KAMAL TEWARIActor-musician Kamal Tewari describes Ray as a genius filmmaker who was instrumental in getting the Western world to appreciate Indian cinema and inspiring many serious filmmakers to tell the Indian story with a difference. Kamal says: “I was particularly taken up by two of his Hindi films Shatranj Ke Khiladi (The Chess Players) and Sadgati (Salvation). Incidentally, both were inspired by two very different short stories by the famous Hpindi writer Munshi Premchand.” Kamal’s favourite of course is the sad story of the annexation of Awadh shown through the decadence of two noblemen engrossed in the game of chess as Wajid Ali Shah is exiled, thanks to the manoeuvrings of the British East India Company officials.“Ray told this fictionalised historical story with great finesse, getting the best out of seasoned mainstream actors such as Sanjeev Kumar and Saeed Jaffrey with Amjad Khan giving a heart-wrenching portrayal of Nawab Wajid Ali Shah, a poet caught in harsh times leading from colonisation.”Kamal also praises the excellent support from Shabana Azmi, Farida Jalal and Farooq Shaikh. “The Kathak mujra in the court was presented with such grace and beauty that one cannot quite forget it,” he says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/roundabout-ray-of-hope-for-indian-cinema/story-049QBtRKti5zE4llhD1X9O.html
10-05-2020||Delhi||Delhi HC says Sonepat-Delhi border curbs a violation of Constitution||The Delhi high court on Friday said Sonepat district magistrate (DM) Anshaj Singh’s orders barring the movement of doctors, nurses, court officials and trucks to and from Delhi were an infringement of constitutional provisions.Saying the order was also in contravention of multiple orders of the Union home secretary, the court issued notices to the Union and Haryana governments to file responses.The DM had passed the order on April 30, arguing that there had been cases of Covid-19 in Sonepat that could be traced to cross-border sources.While the order spoke only about the Sonepat border, the advocate for the petitioner, Nitin Garg, told HT that he had filed the plea for all the five borders, including Aya Nagar, Singhu, Badarpur, Gurugram and Tikri. He said that the order is applicable for all the borders of Delhi and Gurugram. The Haryana government has shut the Faridabad border completely, and not even workers involved in providing essential services are allowed to cross. The state also implemented strict checks at Delhi’s borders with Gurugram, and only those who have been issued passes by the latter’s district administration are permitted to enter the city.Essential service workers, including health care staff in some of the capital’s major Covid hospitals, have complained that these curbs have hindered their ability to work, and has even affected testing. Hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) on Friday, a division bench of the Delhi HC, comprising justices Manmohan and Sanjeev Narula said, “This Court is of the prima facie view that April 30 order by the Sonepat DM constituted an infringement of Articles 19(1)(d) and 301 of the Constitution, especially when the entire national capital and Sonepat are not containment zones.” Article 19 (1)(d) allows every citizen to move freely throughout the territory of India and Article 310 provides for freedom of trade, commerce and intercourse throughout the territory of India.The HC said it was also in agreement with the petitioner’s submission that the action of the Sonepat DM is contrary to the April 15, April 30 and May 1 orders issued by the Union home secretary that detailed the rules of the lockdown.The bench also quoted an April 1 order of a division bench of the Kerala high court which said that even though restrictions may be imposed in times of a national emergency, guidelines issued by the Central government under the Disaster Management Act permit travel for urgent medical treatment. The petitioner, OP Gupta had contended that a number of Delhi residents have to travel to Sonepat for essential work, and vice-versa.He submitted that the Sonepat DM had imposed blanket cross-border transit restrictions between Delhi and Sonepat and granted exemptions to only a few categories of government officials and for movement of goods not destined for Sonepat.The petitioner said that even doctors, nurses and court officials who either lived or worked in Sonepat were being prevented from entering and leaving the city.

10-05-2020||Gurugram||16 new Coronavirus cases; total count reaches 142||Sixteen persons tested positive for coronavirus disease(Covid-19) in the district on Saturday. The persons were from Dundahera, Basai Enclave, Sector 18, Sirhaul, Ardee City, IMT Manesar, and Khandsa mandi. With the new cases, the total number of infected persons in Gurugram has reached 142 cases. Out of these 64 people have been discharged so far. According to the district health bulletin, five persons who tested positive on Saturday are contact of positive cases reported earlier from Dundahera. So far, at least 15 Covid-19 cases have surfaced from Dundahera in May. Two persons from Basai Enclave, who were in contact with a Covid-19 patient, also tested positive. Three vegetable sellers from Khandsa mandi also tested positive on Saturday, taking the total number of infected persons at the wholesale market to 24. A man from Sohna, who works as a lab technician, and a man who visited a hospital in Faridabad, also tested positive for the virus. The health department officials said they are still tracing how the two contracted the virus.A man who was a direct contact of a Covid-19 patient from Sirhaul also tested positive, besides three men from IMT Manesar, Sector 18, and Ardee City who are infected with the deadly virus. Dr Jaswant Singh Punia, said, “We are doing contact tracing for each case and have intensified sampling.” The health department on Saturday collected 228 samples, while the test results are awaited for 488 samples.TWO CORONA POSITIVE PATIENTS DEADThe district health department on Saturday confirmed two persons who were brought dead to the Sector 10 Civil Hospital on May 6 were Covid-19 positive. “One man is from Uttar Pradesh, while the other is from West Bengal, and were not residents of Gurugram. After they were brought dead to the hospital, we took their nose and throat swab for RT-PCR tests. The deceased person tested positive on Friday night,” said Punia. The CMO said the department will be able to share more information only after complete investigation and contact tracing. The health department refused to clarify if the two had died of coronavirus infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/16-new-cases-total-count-reaches-142/story-MtT52H47j5c174ACgY7XNM.html
10-05-2020||Gurugram||As Covid-19 cases in district surge, so does the quantity of biomedical waste||The quantity of Covid-19-related biomedical waste being generated in the district has doubled over the past three weeks, increasing from about 400 kilograms per day on April 18 to 800 kilograms per day on May 8. Medical waste related to the diagnosis and treatment of Covid-19 patients now accounts for 17% of the daily medical waste produced in Gurugram, up from about 10% about three weeks ago. The rest is routine biomedical waste, which comes from outpatient departments, surgical wards and other clinics, to the tune of about 3.8 tonnes per day.During this period, Gurugram saw 93 new cases of Covid-19, with the bulk of them being detected in the past week. Vikas Gehlot, spokesperson for Biotic Waste Management, the sole concessionaire for biomedical waste management in Gurugram district, said that they are expecting this number to rise exponentially over the next few months, given the present growth rate of the disease. “It is likely that by the end of May or early June, the district will produce over a tonne of Covid-19 related biomedical waste every day. A single confirmed positive Covid-19 case creates 10 times more waste than your average patient. So even if the growth rate slows, just a few more cases will still lead to more waste,” Gehlot said. However, Gehlot added that there is presently no cause for concern when it comes to the treatment and handling of such waste. “We have a capacity of 20 tonnes per day at our treatment facility in Sector 37. As such, the increase in quantity can be managed,” he added. The district’s Covid-19 waste comes from 36 health care facilities, isolation wards and testing centres, in addition to quarantined homes. While a concessionaire directly collects Covid-19 waste from hospitals, testing centres and isolation wards, suspected or confirmed patients under home quarantine have been provided with yellow bags to dispose of possibly infected waste, such as head caps, masks, and tissues. The civil surgeon’s office is coordinating collection from these homes and quarantine centres. The waste is then sent to any of the four collection centres in the district, from where two biotic vehicles dedicated only to collecting Covid-19 waste make pick-ups. About 30 drivers and workers are involved in the collection of biomedical waste in the district. However, sanitation workers and waste collectors at the common biomedical waste treatment facility (CBMWTF) in Sector 37 are facing a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE). “We are purchasing PPE privately, at a significantly higher cost than before. We have reached out to state and district authorities for help, but given the shortage of PPE in the market, we are prepared to continue buying the equipment ourselves,” Gehlot said.Presently, the company has been procuring PPE from local vendors who have ramped up their production. “But quality and continuous supply of PPE is still a concern. We conduct quality tests of the PPE ourselves, and carry out site inspections of the factories before purchasing from them. This would not be a worry if we were able to get PPE through a government-regulated supplier,” Gehlot said. The quantity of routine waste has dipped from about 5.5 tonnes in March to about 3.8 tonnes per day following the outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/as-covid-19-cases-in-district-surge-so-does-the-quantity-of-biomedical-waste/story-UljEKpYXlWX5CEx4LBRUUP.html
10-05-2020||Delhi||Covid-19 pandemic sets back Delhi’s infra projects by six months||Major infrastructure projects in the city would be delayed by at least five to six months due to the ongoing Covid crisis, hampering government efforts to streamline traffic flow at major junctions in the city and making roads safer for pedestrians. Even though construction work has begun at some places after a long hiatus in view of the national lockdown to arrest the spread of Sars-Cov-2, funding and labour remain pertinent problems before the contractors. Last week, the government had relaxed norms but still several restrictions remain regarding social distancing and management of labour at the sites. Construction on key projects across the capital had been in limbo for the past nearly six months. In November, all construction activity in Delhi was banned in view of rising air pollution. It was completely lifted on February 14, but within almost a month, it was again halted on March 25 due to the nationwide corona lockdown. The Delhi government’s Public Works Department (PWD) is helming key projects such as the construction of 1.2-km-long tunnel between Purana Qila road near Mathura Road and the Ring Road, which is part of ITPO Pragati Maidan Redevelopment Project; Barapullah phase-3 elevated corridor; Ashram underpass; flyovers at Seelampur and Shastri Park; Benito-Juarez Road underpass.“Deadlines for almost all projects are likely to be extended. Work has started but it is going on very slow. Since November, we have not been able to work properly,” a senior PWD engineer said requesting anonymity.With thousands of labourers returning home and the Delhi government making it clear that it will release funds on priority only for Covid-related works, the construction work is expected to take a lot of time to pick up pace, officials associated with several projects said. S Velmurugan, senior principal scientist, traffic engineering and safety division, Central Road Research Institute (CRRI), said, “Such long delays will not only delay freedom from crippling traffic jams but also escalate project cost. Projects such as Ashram underpass and Barapullah-3 are of utmost importance as they aim to decongest traffic bottlenecks at Ashram, Ring Road, ITO,” he said.Sewa Ram, professor at School of Planning and Architecture (SPA), said the city may have to wait another winter for key infra projects to finish. “It is going to have a ripple effect. The cost will escalate, then fresh approvals would be needed and fresh resources will have to be mobilised. The government may have a relook at some of the projects or halt them temporarily,” Ram said.A look at five key infra projects that have been hit by intermittent delays. Delhi’s first road tunnelThe PWD is constructing this Rs 777-crore project, which entails construction of a 1.2-km-long tunnel and six underpasses to ease travel to India Gate and parts of central Delhi from different corners of the city especially from east Delhi, Noida and Ghaziabad.The tunnel road, a first for Delhi, would go beneath the Pragati Maidan, which is being revamped. The tunnel will start near National Sports Complex of India (NSCI) on Purana Qila Road and culminate on the Ring Road near Pragati Power station. PWD officials said that about 70% work of the project has been completed.“The June deadline is to be extended by around three months. Big exhaust fans, which are used to maintain air circulation in the tunnel by throwing smoke emanating from vehicles out of the tunnel, were to be procured from Germany but due to lockdown the process could not be started,” a PWD official said.Ashram underpass project:It is one of the most awaited projects of the city because the underpass can help decongest of the most busiest stretches across Delhi. The project entails construction of a 750-metre-long underpass along Mathura Road at busy Ashram crossing. The project also include extension of existing Ashram flyover on the Ring Road up to the beginning of DND Flyway. According to PWD officials, only around five percent construction work of the underpass has been completed while the construction of flyover extension is yet to start.Traffic police data shows that around 3 lakh vehicles cross the Ashram intersection every day during peak traffic hours. Deadline of the underpass construction is December 2020. It is likely to be extended by around four to five months as work couldn’t be carried out at desired pace.“Preparatory works such as site marking, site survey and utility identification was completed. But we could not start construction work in full swing as the we could not get required traffic diversion due to protests at Shaheen Bagh. Because of protests, the road leading to Noida was closed so entire traffic was moving through Ashram only. Later, the construction work was stalled due to coronavirus outbreak,” a PWD official said on the condition of anonymity.The official added that now they have asked the concessionaire to resume construction activities on the site.Barapullah Phase-3 elevated corridor:The elevated corridor aims to provide seamless connectivity between Mayur Vihar-I and Sarai Kale Khan, where it will meet the existing Barapullah-I elevated corridor, making the nearly 9.5km journey to AIIMS signal free. In September 2019, the government had issued a gazette notification to start acquisition of two patches of land — 250m and 500m — which had stalled the progress of the 3.5-km elevated corridor project for the last four years. The land belongs to farmers of Nagli Razapur village near Sarai Kale Khan.“By publishing the land acquisition notification, the government had paved way for removing the major hurdle of the project. After this the district administration had to begin the process of land acquisition but it was stalled earlier because of model code of conduct and later due to coronavirus lockdown,” a senior PWD official said on the condition of anonymity. Flyovers at Shastri Park and Seelampur:The construction of these flyovers had started in February 2019 and was to be ended in March 2020 but the project hit a hurdle initially when construction was banned due to pollution and later because of riots in north east Delhi. A majority of the migrant labourers employed in the construction of these two projects have fled to their villages fearing attacks. “The construction was further banned due to coronavirus lockdown on March 25. Now we have resumed construction activities and are hoping to complete the project in next two months as over 85% work has been completed,” a PWD official said.These flyovers aim to end traffic bottlenecks in congested east and north-east Delhi areas such as Shahdara, Welcome, Shastri Park, Kashmere Gate, Seelampur and Kajoori Khas.Benito-Juarez Road underpassThe project includes construction of a three-lane underpass, near Venkateswara College, in south Delhi. It will connect Benito Juarez Road— the radial road connecting the Ring Road with the Outer Ring Road — with San Martin Road. The facility will reduce travel time from the airport to central Delhi and AIIMS by 20 minutes and 15 minutes, respectively. “The project was initially delayed due to shifting of utilities, and the complex nature of construction work. Later it was delayed by the construction bans imposed due to pollution and Covid-19 lockdown,” an official said associated with the project said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pandemic-sets-back-delhi-s-infra-projects-by-six-months/story-0fcq2ElDkD66hYyifQIvlL.html
10-05-2020||Delhi||Separated from parents, 2-year-old spends tough night in isolation||At 7pm on Friday, a two-year-old boy tested Covid-19 positive in Delhi’s Kalawati Saran Children’s Hospital. The child was immediately moved to an isolation ward, away from his parents who are awaiting their own test results. Doctors are unsure how the child caught the virus and the health care workers will begin their contact tracing programme once the parents’ results too are in.So far, the youngest casualty of the virus in the Capital was a 45-day-old infant.Doctors and nurses of Kalawati Saran Children’s Hospital, who were on duty on Friday night, narrated how the child spent the night away from his parents, who are isolated in Lady Hardinge Hospital, while the staff tried everything to keep the him comfortable.“The child was admitted to the hospital on Thursday and his test results came out on Friday. He was in the hospital’s severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) ward but after the results came, he was shifted to the Covid ward,” said a senior doctor, who was with the child through Friday night.The doctor said that while the child was playful for the first few hours after being shifted to the coronavirus wing. “But as time went by, he started becoming restless. Since the child’s parents were yet to get their results, he was left with the medicos for his care,” he said.“Taking care of infants, especially when they are forced to stay in isolation without their parents, is very difficult,” said a nurse in the hospital, who did not wish to be identified.The task became all the more challenging because the child is still dependent on breast milk and had to be fed in regular intervals. In such cases, when a mother is unable to feed the baby directly the hospital relies on expressed breast milk where the milk from the mother is collected and fed to the child by a nurse using a bowl and a spoon.“By 8.30pm, we did the first feeding after which he played for a while and took a nap. But as the night passed and the child did not see any familiar face around, he started panicking,” the nurse said.She said that the baby may have gotten scared of the hospital staff entering the ward to check his health status wearing in the personal protective equipment (PPE), which covers from head to toe. The child kept waking up through the night and around 4am on Saturday woke up again, crying.“We were checking for any physical discomforts and changed the diaper also, just to be sure. He was largely irritable all night,” another nurse in the ward said.The health care professionals who are tending to the baby said that in the coming days if the tests of the baby’s parents come out negative, they will be allowed to come and see the child, but only after they are fully geared with safety equipment.Dr. N N Mathur, director, Lady Hardinge Medical College, under which the Kalawati Saran Children’s Hospital is associated, said that the situation was tricky but the hospital was prepared to take up the challenge.“When we see such young children get infected, it is heart-breaking. But our primary aim as a children’s hospital is to give our best and cure them at the earliest,” Dr Mathur said.Dr. Anjali Prabhakaran, a paediatrician who is researching on the effects and treatment possibilities for Covid-19 infected children, said that though symptoms of the infection in younger children is not very severe when compared to adults, it is imperative that extreme care be taken while caring for them. There is no separate global protocol for children infected with the infectious virus.“Many children show signs of fatigue, nasal congestion, runny nose, diarrhoea and head ache along with fever. What is even more challenging in paediatric cases is the isolation, so looking at familiar faces of family member really boosts their spirits,” Dr Prabhakaran.Until Saturday night, Delhi had reported 6542 Covid-19 positive cases with 68 deaths and 2,020 recoveries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/separated-from-parents-2-yr-old-spends-tough-night-in-isolation/story-IbDTDIPBH2ol5T3RPQXXBJ.html

Packed food has also been provided to the passengers.The workers, a majority of them from Nayagaon, Balongi, Dera Bassi, Sohana, Zirakpur and Kharar, were screened thoroughly at the designated collection centres, from where they were brought to the station in buses which were sanitised before boarding and deboarding.The workers also expressed their gratitude to the government for enabling their journey back home free of cost.2 Mohali men booked for cheating migrants with false promises to take them home to BiharPolice have booked two persons, including the owner of a fleet of private buses, for cheating migrant workers in Mohali’s Madanpura village by charging them Rs 3,800 each and making false promises to take them to their home state Bihar.Acting on information on Saturday that 70 to 80 migrants, including children, had collected at the parking lot of Bassi Theatre in Phase 2 in violation of the curfew, the police discovered that false promises had been made to take them to Bihar by buses leaving in the evening.The police arrested Akhilesh, an accountant working for Harvinder Singh, the owner of the buses. “Four of Harvinder’s buses are attached with a private college in Mohali to pick and drop students. Harvinder is yet to be arrested,” said Manphull Singh, station house officer (SHO), Phase 1 police station.“The accused did not have the permission for inter-state travel, nor has the district administration authorised them to do so. They had also charged the migrants Rs 3,800 each,” the SHO said.A case under section 188 and 420 of the IPC has been registered at the Phase 1 police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/2-mohali-men-booked-for-cheating-migrants-with-false-promises-to-take-them-home-to-bihar/story-UczOlJo914Ol4ysbx1nAOJ.html

HT had also reported that all the foreign members of the Jamaat staying in Delhi’s quarantine facilities will face criminal proceedings as per law for visa and passport violations, among other transgressions, if any.In a letter to deputy commissioners (administration), DDMA Special CEO K S Meena said all 567 foreign Jamaat attendees will be handed over to Delhi Police.The district magistrates will explore the possibility of sending those Jamaat members, who belong to other states, in buses to their designated places in accordance with social-distancing norms and other protocols, Meena said.“Out of such persons belonging to Delhi, who could be released as per prescribed guidelines should be issued passes to travel from the quarantine centres. In no circumstances, the aforesaid persons should be allowed to stay in any other places, including any masjids, etc,” Meena said in the letter.Meena said the nodal officer and the area ACPs should ensure that Jamaat members belonging to other states reach their place of residence,.“The DC should also inform the respective resident commissioner of their states in respect of each and every movement of such persons from Delhi,” Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) Special CEO said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/govt-issues-order-to-release-indian-tablighi-jamaat-members/story-OCLyx2m5W4s6N664Wes2tL.html
10-05-2020||Chandigarh||Delhi HC terms Sonepat DM’s orders violation of constitution||The Delhi high court on Friday said that orders of Sonepat district magistrate (DM) Anshaj Singh obstructing the movement of doctors, nurses, court officials and trucks from Delhi to Sonepat constituted an infringement of the constitutional provisions.The DM had on April 30 restricted movement on grounds that there have been cases of Covid-19 in Sonepat with contact history traced to cross-border sources.Hearing public interest litigation (PIL), a division bench of the Delhi HC comprising Justice Manmohan and Justice Sanjeev Narula said: “This court is of the prima facie view that April 30 order issued by the Sonepat DM constituted an infringement of Articles 19(1)(d) and 301 of the Constitution, especially when the entire national capital and Sonepat are not containment zones.”Article 19 (1)(d) allows every citizen to move freely throughout the territory of India and Article 310 provides for freedom of trade, commerce and intercourse throughout the territory of India.The Delhi HC said it was also in prima facie agreement with the submission of the petitioner that the action of the Sonepat DM is contrary to the orders of April 15 and 30 issued by the Union home secretary.The bench also quoted an April 1 order of a division bench of Kerala high court which said that no doubt, restrictions may be imposed in times of a national emergency such as the present, but when the guidelines issued by the central government under the Disaster Management Act itself permits to travel for urgent medical treatment, then the said guidelines have necessarily to be enforced by the central government through the removal of the blockades that prevent such travel.”The petitioner, OP Gupta, had contended before the court that as Sonepat is not only contiguous to Delhi but also a part of the national capital region, a number of Delhi residents have to travel to Sonepat for essential work and vice versa.He submitted that the Sonepat district magistrate has imposed blanket cross-border transit restrictions between Delhi and Sonepat and granted exemptions to only a few categories of government officials and for movement of goods not destined for Sonepat.The petitioner said that even doctors, nurses, and court officials who either resided or worked in Sonepat were being prevented from entering and leaving the city.

On the first day, while owners of many restaurants faced problems in arranging supplies such as dairy items, others only aimed at cleaning their stores and get it ready for business. Some restaurant owners said they would now be able to retain the labour that was moving back to their home states. ‘10% RESPONSE ON FIRST DAY’“Only 10% response was witnessed on the first day of operations on Saturday as the public was confused over how and through which mode the deliveries would be made. We are taking all necessary precautions to ensure hygienic is maintained in delivery of food,” said Bhupinder Basant, owner of Basant Restaurants located near Fountain Chowk and Feroze Gandhi Market.Hotel and Restaurants’ Association chairman Rajinder Basant said they are expecting a good response in the coming days “as the public has been sitting in their houses for a long time.” Owner of Indian Summers, Sahil Kansal, said they were already following the standard operating procedure for the home delivery of cooked food. “We put the system in place on Saturday as our restaurant was closed for long. I will be able to comment about the customers’ response only after commencing the services,” he said.Meanwhile, sweet shops (halwai shops) also witnessed a similar response on the first day. “Something is better than nothing. Shopkeepers are relieved as their shops have reopened and the labour has been put to work,” said Narinderpal Singh Pappu, president of halwai association, Punjab. On Friday, the administration had allowed restaurants, eateries, juice, ice cream and sweet shops to open from 7am to 7pm, but only for home delivery. Earlier in second week of April too, restaurants were permitted to deliver food, but the orders were rolled back on April 16 after a pizza delivery boy in New Delhi was found positive for the virus, leaving as many as 72 families quarantined. ‘GRANT PERMISSION ONLY TO FSSAI CERTIFICATE HOLDERS’Meanwhile, president of Hotels and Restaurants’ Association, Amarvir Singh, said the administration should allow only those restaurants to deliver cooked food who have got Food Safety and Standards Authority of India certificates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/coronavirus-lockdown-home-delivery-service-by-restaurants-sweet-shops-gets-off-to-a-slow-start-in-ludhiana/story-sstkuDEOGOqJaepMF9w9lM.html

However, a total of 2,598 claims have been rejected by the department so far while a sum of ₹20.9 crore has been disbursed since April 1.Dheeraj Gupta, regional commissioner, said that the major reason behind the rejection of claims is the difference in the bank account seeded in KYC/UAN (Universal Account Number) and the bank account attached with the online claim form.“Sometimes, people change their bank accounts, but fail to get them updated with the PF account. The difference in the bank IFSC code number, illegible uploaded PDF copy of bank passbook or cheque book are among the other major reasons behind the rejection of advance claims,” said Gupta. Gupta said, “Sometimes, the cheque or the passbook attached with the claim did not open or showed error due to incorrect uploading by the beneficiaries.”Gupta, however, said the department is contacting all the beneficiaries and informing them about the errors, that led to the rejection of the claims so that they can reapply by following all the procedures.“If you have not received the settled amount for long, please check the bank details in your UAN and in the cheque leaf enclosed by you along with the form. If there is any mismatch, the settled amount is not credited and is returned,” read the recent tweet made by the Employees Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) in its Twitter handle.GOVT NOTIFICATIONAs per the notification dated March 30, the ministry had relaxed the rules of PF withdrawals to help those in financial distress due to the pandemic. As per the notification, EPFO subscribers can either withdraw 75% of their savings or up to a maximum of three months’ basic pay and dearness allowance from their PF accounts, whichever is lower. Once a subscriber withdraws the amount, it cannot be replenished after the situation improves.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/over-2-500-pf-withdrawal-requests-get-rejected-due-to-incomplete-bank-details/story-O6pdc7hAva3RfusDSbn5BK.html

However, the Punjab government’s decision to promote Class 10 students based on their performance in pre-board exams has left students worried, especially those who failed in the exams.Even meritorious students feel disappointed as they had prepared rigorously for the board exams in the last three months and were waiting for the date sheet to be declared. Manvi Dholan, a Class 10 student, said she was disappointed with the decision taken by the government as she had been preparing hard for the final exams. “I scored 99% marks overall in the pre-board exams held in January with 100% marks both in mathematics and Hindi. I had aimed to score 100% marks in the final board exams and had also appeared in all the test series conducted by the mentors online,” she added.As per the report of the district authorities, over 65 students in government schools of Ludhiana had failed in all five subjects in the pre-board exams held in January this year. “A total of 17,000 students of Class 10 appeared in the pre-board exams. Around 82 students scored above 95% marks while 350 students scored above 90% marks in the pre-board exams,” mentioned the report.In January, the district officials had also differentiated the government schools as top and poor performers. Among these, Government High School, Ramgarh Bhullar, ranked the lowest in the district. The headmistress of the school, Kanta Devi, said, “Of a total 51 students who appeared in the pre-board exams in the school, only two students failed in English.”Government Senior Secondary School, Galib Kalan, which ranked 339 in the district was among poor performers. The principal of the school, Baljit Kaur, said, “We have a total of 89 students in Class 10 in our school and many of these students have flunked in mathematics in the pre-board exams.”“With the help of extra classes, many students have improved their score and we were expecting that they will get through in the board exams,” added the principal. District education officer, secondary, Swaranjit Kaur, said, “We have so far not received any instructions from the head office to promote students of Class 10 on the basis of their pre-board performance.” The DEO said that she will only be able to comment only after she receives some information regarding the same.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/class-10-students-in-ludhiana-unhappy-over-govt-s-decision-to-promote-them-based-on-pre-board-exam-results/story-Q4WMBUljj6TrTypOEmw17N.html

At a time when inter-state migration of the labour is on the rise, local migration is also taking place to areas where industrial operations have been allowed. FICO president Gurmeet Singh Kular said, “The government has allowed industrial operations in designated areas, while the units on mixed land use areas have been left behind. Now, labourers who don’t want to move back to their home states are shifting to the industries situated in designated areas. In the coming days, this will increase trouble for the micro and small industry that is already reeling under losses.” “Even ice-cream shops are allowed to operate, but no permission has been granted to the micro industry where it is easier to maintain social distancing,” he said. The FICO president also said, “Due to the government’s move, the large industries will also have to shut their operations in the coming days as most of their vendors operate on mixed land use areas.” Earlier, various industrial organisations, including FICO, Chamber of Industrial and Commercial Undertakings and Janta Nagar Small Scale Manufacturers’ Association, had warned the state government of launching an agitation if the government fails to allow the mixed land use industries to operate by May 17. LIP URGES CAPTAIN TO ALLOW INDUSTRIAL OPERATIONS Meanwhile, Lok Insaaf Party president and Atam Nagar MLA Simarjit Singh Bains has also urged chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh to allow the functioning of industries on the mixed land use areas. He said the micro and small industry is already reeling under loses and the government, instead of helping them in the time of crisis, is increasing the trouble for them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/fico-observes-black-day-demands-nod-to-industrial-operations-on-mixed-land-use-areas/story-EKmQqmSOSxR9Xr2yB1vxcP.html
10-05-2020||City||Charging school fees during the lockdown could pinch parents||The Chandigarh education department has ordered schools to defer fee payment until the lifting of lockdown due to the Covid-19 outbreak, in spite of which some private unaided schools have been asking parents to pay up, claiming this will help them cover teachers’ salaries.The director of school education, Chandigarh, Rubinderjit Singh Brar, has said that the UT education department stands by its previous order on fee collection and that parents cannot be forced by the schools to pay up. Any parent willingly wanting to submit the dues, however, can do so, he has said.The UT education department has deferred the payment of tuition fees for the 2020-21 session till government and private schools reopen after the lockdown. Parents will also be given a month to make the payment once the fee collection dates are announced. Citing lack of funds in absence of fee collection, approximately 50 of 77 private schools in Chandigarh have said that they will not be paying salaries to teachers and Class 4 employees for April. A representative of independent schools says the education department’s order is “highly unfair”, and that the schools will have no options but to approach the courts for a resolution.Around 12,000 teachers and 7,000 Class 4 employees working in private schools in Chandigarh are likely to be impacted by these developments.Some parents have argued that had private unaided schools put up their balance sheets online (only a few have done so), as directed by the education department, those which were short of funds could have been allowed to charge a nominal fee to cover the teachers’ salaries.Parents also say given the financial constraints they face during the lockdown, they should not be made to pay for the fat salaries of top management and trustees of the school.FEES FRACASShould private schools charge fees during the Covid-19 lockdown period?Should private schools charge fees during the lockdown period and should the salaries of teachers be held back?

Gaikwad said that Pune will have a completely different model now.“Earlier people from containment areas claimed that they did not have food, but now the civic body itself took the decision to deliver the grocery kits in 70,000 homes which will now have enough grocery for ten days,” he added.According to Gaikwad, there are two models functioning in the city – on one side the civic body is relaxing restrictions and trying to re-open maximum businesses for the economy and on the other where strict measures are being enforced to ensure that Covid-19 is contained.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pmc-puts-up-additional-barricades-in-red-zones/story-MMPTRc5hmb7G85xZllV2NM.html

We will be procuring steel beds which will cost less than Rs1,000 and the decision on the same will be taken soon.”“We also plan to erect portable oxygen ventilators and the medical teams are already guiding the engineering teams in the planning process,” said Gaikwad.Commissioner said, “PMC has already appointed the staff for building the temporary hospital at Balewadi. We are planning to hire staff from other government departments to manage the hospital. We have also requested the state and central government departments to provide us with the required staff to manage the hospital.” Recently, when Pune district guardian Minister Ajit Pawar had visited the city to take an overview of the Covid-19 situation and he had instructed the divisional commissioner and PMC commissioner that if necessary, a temporary hospital can be created at Balewadi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pmc-starts-work-on-10-000-bed-temporary-hospital-at-balewadi-sports-complex/story-W3KVKn9iyT8PYSwqBuvbdL.html

10-05-2020||World||British pubs in crisis as large beer stocks go waste amid Covid-19 pandemic||It is a symbol of British culture, but the pub faces a crisis of survival in the coronavirus pandemic: thousands face closure, while gallons of beer, ale, cider and other drinks in stock have gone waste - including in many ‘desi pubs’ in London and elsewhere.One brewery left with surplus when the lockdown was announced is giving away beer for free, with people – maintaining social distancing – lining up in Northumberland to take home the tipple that has a relatively short life span of three weeks.But in pubs across the UK – many with histories dating back centuries – the buzz of conversation is absent, so is the fizz of craft drinks. The British Beer & Pub Association says 40% of 47,000 pubs will not survive beyond September without government support.They include a large number of ‘desi pubs’ that combine the traditions of the British pub with Indian food and music, such as Bollywood songs and live ‘bhangra’ performances, particularly in parts of London, Leicester, Birmingham and the west Midlands.Ministers have indicated that pubs and restaurants would be the last to re-open, not at least until the end of August. Some pubs have diversified into delivering drinks to homes, but since there is no ban on selling liquor in shops, such sales are small.Emma McClarkin of the British Beer & Pub Association, says: “Nearly half of the UK’s pubs could close unless the government does more to help them. For the sake of communities and jobs across the UK – as well as the very institution of the great British pub – the government cannot allow that to happen”.“Nearly 19,000 pubs are at risk and 320,000 jobs too…Our ask to the government is clear, recognise the real jeopardy facing the great British pub and act now to save it, or risk losing many locals and their communities”, she adds.Industry estimates say even before the lockdown, the pubs’ historic role as a convivial place to meet, socialise and more faced challenge from the proliferation of coffee shops and restaurants. There were around 60,000 pubs in 2000; now the figure is 47,000.Some insist this reflects a progressive loss of the British way of life, and hark to novelist George Orwell’s famous 1946 essay, The Moon Under Water, that described the perfect pub: Victorian fittings, cast-iron fireplaces, food, garden, and charming family-friendly places.Calling for a 12-month business rates holiday to deal with the effect of the pandemic, Ruth Sloan of Campaign for Real Ale, the consumer group representing beer drinkers and pub goers, says: “When all this is over, many of us are looking forward to getting down to the pub for a pint with friends and family”.“Pubs are a vital part of our social fabric, helping to tackle loneliness and social isolation, providing a place for communities to meet and offering a supervised setting for responsible drinking”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/british-pubs-in-crisis-as-large-beer-stocks-go-waste-amid-covid-19-pandemic/story-HZjLdm5Y2y9vg8qA4GbZgI.html

Salve also said Pakistan has not complied with the court’s ruling to stay Jadhav’s execution and review his conviction.Foreign Office spokesperson Aisha Farooqui responded on Sunday by saying Pakistan rejects the “baseless and inaccurate” remarks by Salve. She said in a statement that Pakistan has “fully complied” with the ICJ’s judgement. “We firmly reject the Indian counsel’s baseless and inaccurate assertion that Pakistan has not complied with the ICJ’s judgment in the case. Pakistan has fully complied with the judgment and remains committed to continue doing so as the case proceeds further,” she said.“Pakistan has granted India consular access to commander Jadhav and is processing measures for effective review and reconsideration as per the guidelines provided by ICJ in its judgment,” she added.Farooqui said it was “regrettable” that Salve made statements which misrepresent facts”, adding Pakistan had abided by “all its international obligations”.There was no immediate response to Farooqui’s remarks from Indian officials.Jadhav was arrested by Pakistani security agencies in Balochistan in March 2016 and charged with involvement in spying. In April 2017, Pakistan announced he had been given the death sentence by a military court. Salve had also said during the online lection that Pakistan had refused to respond to queries about how it would carry out the ICJ’s ruling to review and reconsider Jadhav’s case. “I think we have reached a point where we have to now decide whether we want to go back to ICJ for consequential directions because Pakistan has not moved ahead,” he had said.The ICJ ruled in July last year that Pakistan had violated Jadhav’s rights under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and stayed his execution while calling on Islamabad to take all measures for an “effective review and reconsideration” of his conviction and sentence, including “enacting appropriate legislation”.India has rejected the allegations against Jadhav and said he was kidnapped by Pakistani operatives from the Iranian port of Chabahar, where he was running a business. Pakistan has so far granted consular access to Jadhav only once since his arrest in 2016.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/baseless-inaccurate-pakistan-rejects-india-s-allegations-in-kulbhushan-jadhav-case/story-rBizqxVFC1aFbGY2UHisqL.html
10-05-2020||World||Seoul closes bars and clubs over fears of coronavirus second wave||South Korea’s capital has ordered the closure of all clubs and bars after a burst of new cases sparked fears of a second coronavirus wave, and President Moon Jae-in urged the public to remain vigilant.The nation has been held up as a global model in how to curb the virus, but the order from the Seoul mayor on Saturday followed a new infection cluster in Itaewon, one of the city’s busiest nightlife districts.More than 50 cases so far have been linked to a 29-year-old man who tested positive after spending time at five clubs and bars in Itaewon last weekend.“Carelessness can lead to an explosion in infections,” said Seoul mayor Park Won-soon, adding the order will remain in effect indefinitely.Gyeonggi province -- which surrounds Seoul with a population of around 12 million people -- also ordered more than 5,700 entertainment facilities to suspend operations for two weeks starting Sunday.With around 7,200 people estimated to have visited the five establishments, health authorities have warned of a further spike in infections and have asked those who went to any of the venues to get tested.Of the 34 new infections reported on Sunday, 24 were tied to the Itaewon cluster, according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.“We cannot but feel sorry to see the emergence of the new infection cluster surrounding the Itaewon clubs,” KCDC director Jeong Eun-kyeong told reporters. The spike in new infections came as everyday life in South Korea was slowly returning to normal, with the government relaxing social distancing rules last Wednesday.President Moon said Sunday the new cluster had “raised awareness that even during the stabilisation phase, similar situations can arise again anytime”.‘Not over’ “It’s not over until it’s over,” Moon said during a speech marking his third anniversary of taking office.“While keeping enhanced alertness till the end, we must never lower our guard regarding epidemic prevention,” he added.Moon has enjoyed growing public support on the back of his government’s handling of the virus, which led to a landslide victory for his ruling party at last month’s parliamentary elections.The usually bustling streets of Itaewon were largely empty on Sunday afternoon, with bars and clubs fronting signs reading “Temporarily closed for business” or “Prevention of assembly”.“I think this incident can happen anywhere, not only in Itaewon,” said Kim Jae-sung, a chef at a neighbourhood restaurant.“What is most important is one’s social distancing, avoiding enclosed places and being aware so that incidents like this won’t happen again,” he told AFP.Lee Seung-wook, a 22-year-old restaurant worker, added: “We hope customers will be more co-operative when we ask for their names for the visiting records since we all need to work together.”The country endured one of the worst early outbreaks of the disease outside mainland China, and while it never imposed a compulsory lockdown, strict social distancing had been widely observed since March.But it appears to have brought its outbreak under control thanks to an extensive “trace, test and treat” programme that has drawn widespread praise.Facilities such as museums and churches have reopened and some professional sports -- including baseball and soccer -- have started new seasons, while schools are set to re-open starting next week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/seoul-closes-bars-and-clubs-over-fears-of-coronavirus-second-wave/story-qygCQO4j5dD79Bt4lHD1lM.html

A source familiar with the call confirmed them to Reuters.Obama said the election “is so important because what we’re going to be battling is not just a particular individual or a political party.”“What we’re fighting against is these long-term trends in which being selfish, being tribal, being divided, and seeing others as an enemy -- that has become a stronger impulse in American life,” he said.He said this is one reason why “the response to this global crisis has been so anemic and spotty.”“It would have been bad even with the best of governments. It has been an absolute chaotic disaster when that mindset -- of ‘what’s in it for me’ and ‘to heck with everybody else’ -- when that mindset is operationalized in our government,” Obama said.“That’s why, I, by the way, am going to be spending as much time as necessary and campaigning as hard as I can for Joe Biden,” he said.Obama’s office declined to comment.White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany said Trump’s response to the coronavirus “has been unprecedented” and has saved American lives.She harked back to the Ukraine inquiry launched by Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives last year that led to House passage of articles of impeachment against Trump. The Republican-led Senate acquitted Trump early this year.“While Democrats were pursuing a sham witch hunt against President Trump, President Trump was shutting down travel from China. While Democrats encouraged mass gatherings, President Trump was deploying PPE, ventilators, and testing across the country,” she said.National polls show a tight race between Trump and Biden with six months to go until the election. Biden leads in several battleground states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-leaked-call-obama-describes-trump-s-handling-of-covid-19-as-chaotic/story-PzqlpJp2cC7QoDT3QTBjrO.html

And Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergies and Infections Diseases told CNN he will be going in “modified quarantine”. All three are members of the White task force on the coronavirus outbreak.Fauci has said he will be working from home, will wear a mask and will go to office only when he will be sure to be the only one around at the time.Fauci, Hahn and Redfield are scheduled to testify before a committee of the US senate on Tuesday, but they will now not appear in person but through a video link.The source of their exposure was not identified. Katie Miller, press secretary of Vice-President Mike Pence, who tested positive for Covid-19 on Friday, used to frequently attend the meeting of the task force, which is headed by her boss. She is the second White House staffer to test positive, after a US navy personnel serving as a personal valet to the president.The White House has stepped up screening since and both the president and the vice-president are now tested every day.At least 11 members of the US Secret Service, which protects present and past presidents, have also tested positive and 60 are in self-quarantine for possible exposure, according to news reports. It was not clear if any of them had been posted at the White House at the time of their exposure.President Donald Trump has personally faced criticism for not following his administration’s Covid-19 protocols to wear a mask in situations were social distancing may be difficult. He met US military leaders at the White House on Saturday and did not wear a face covering, neither did any of the others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-us-covid-19-task-force-officials-self-quarantine-after-possible-exposure/story-AVmdvWSU7fzAsFMnn4VdzI.html
10-05-2020||World||Rare inflammatory syndrome linked to Covid-19 kills 3 kids in New York, says governor Andrew Cuomo||Three children in New York have died from a rare inflammatory syndrome believed to be linked to the novel coronavirus, governor Andrew Cuomo said on Saturday, a development that may augur a pandemic risk for the very young.Both Cuomo and his counterpart in the neighbouring state of New Jersey also spoke on Saturday about the pandemic’s growing toll on mental health, another factor on the minds of governors as they weigh the impact of mounting job losses against health risks in moving to loosen restrictions on daily life.Nearly all of the 50 US states will have taken steps to relax lockdown measures by this weekend, including states like Arizona and Mississippi, which are reporting increasing infections of Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, highlighting the risk of a new wave of outbreaks.Cuomo told a daily briefing that he was increasingly worried about a syndrome that shares symptoms with toxic shock and Kawasaki disease, which he said included inflammation of the blood vessels and potentially fatal damage to the heart.He said three children - including a five-year old disclosed on Friday - have died from such symptoms while also testing positive for Covid-19 or related antibodies, suggesting a link that was still not fully understood.Cuomo, who has emerged as a leading national voice on states’ response to the coronavirus crisis, said state health officials were reviewing 73 similar cases, which have rattled a prior assumption that children were largely not susceptible to the novel coronavirus.“We are not so sure that is the fact anymore. Toddler, elementary school children are presenting symptoms similar to Kawasaki disease or toxic shock-like syndrome,” Cuomo said. “It’s very possible that this has been going on for several weeks and it hasn’t been diagnosed as related to COVID.”Cuomo said state health officials had partnered with the New York Genome Center and the Rockefeller University to look at whether there is a genetic basis for the syndrome and have been asked by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to develop national criteria for identifying and treating cases.The syndrome shares symptoms with toxic shock and Kawasaki disease, which is associated with fever, skin rashes, swelling of the glands, and in severe cases, inflammation of arteries of the heart. Scientists are still trying to determine whether the syndrome is linked with the new coronavirus because not all children with it have tested positive for the virus.At a separate briefing, New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy said the death of a four-year old disclosed on Friday was not related to the syndrome. “This is a very specific situation with this blessed little kid and we are going to leave it at that.”‘TOXIC MIX’New York and New Jersey are at the epicenter of the pandemic in the United States, accounting for nearly half of the 77,737 American deaths from Covid-19, according to a Reuters tally, and the two states have among the strictest lockdown rules still in place.They are also at the center of a devastating economic toll underscored in government data released on Friday showing the US unemployment rate rose to 14.7% last month, up from 3.5% in February and shattering the post-World War Two record of 10.8% set in November 1982. Cuomo said his state has seen increasing reports of mental health issues, substance abuse and domestic violence, all tied to the economic stress and isolation of the lockdowns.On Friday a study released by the Well Being Trust and the American Academy of Family Physicians estimated an additional 75,000 people could lose their lives to suicide, drugs and other contributors to “deaths of despair” stemming from the crisis.Murphy echoed those concerns. “The cure for the health crisis is keeping people isolated,” Murphy told his briefing. “You add to that job loss, small businesses that have been crushed. It’s a toxic mix.”Cuomo said 226 New Yorkers died from Covid-19 on Friday, up from 216 a day earlier, but less than half the levels recorded two weeks ago. He said hospitalizations and intubations continued their downward trend, further evidence the state has gained a measure of control over the virus.Murphy said an additional 166 residents of his state had died over the past 24 hours from Covid-19, bringing its total fatalities to 9,116, while total cases rose by 1,759 to 137,085.On a positive note, Murphy said the number of people hospitalized for the disease continued to fall, with the 422 patients discharged over the past 24 hours outpacing the 364 newly admitted for treatment.Yet Murphy warned against complacency and said his constituents should continue to practice social distancing. “We are not out of the woods, folks. Let’s not forget that,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rare-inflammatory-syndrome-linked-to-covid-19-kills-3-kids-in-new-york-says-governor-andrew-cuomo/story-OqHynecg0iJNjSJWppn3YO.html

He was loved by his family and adored by millions,” his family said in a statement through their lawyer, Bill Sobel.Richard’s bass guitarist, Charles Glenn, told celebrity website TMZ the musician had been sick for two months and that he died surrounded by his brother, sister and son.At his peak in the late 1950s and early ‘60s, Richard shouted, moaned, screamed and trilled hits like “Good Golly, Miss Molly” and “Lucille,” all the while pounding the piano like a mad man and punctuating lyrics with an occasional shrill “whoooo!”Time magazine said he played “songs that sounded like nonsense ... but whose beat seemed to hint of unearthly pleasures centered somewhere between the gut and the gutter.”The music drew in both young black and white fans at a time when parts of the United States still were strictly segregated. Many white artists, such as Pat Boone, had their own hit versions of Richard’s songs, albeit considerably toned down and “safer” for the pop audience.“I’ve always thought that rock ‘n’ roll brought the races together,” Richard once told an interviewer. “Although I was black, the fans didn’t care. I used to feel good about that.”Mick Jagger, Paul McCartney, James Brown, Otis Redding, David Bowie and Rod Stewart all cited Little Richard as an influence. Jimi Hendrix, who played in Richard’s band in the mid-1960s, said he wanted to use his guitar the way Richard used his voice.FASHION STATEMENT“I am the innovator,” Richard would tell interviewers and audiences. “I am the originator. I am the emancipator. I am the architect of rock ‘n’ roll!”Little Richard’s sonic extravagance was matched by his campy flamboyance. He wore brightly colored suits, a pencil-thin mustache, a carefully curled 6-inch pompadour, mascara, pancake makeup and lipstick.“Elvis may have been the king of rock ‘n ‘roll but I am the queen,” he proclaimed.He was born Dec. 5, 1932 as Richard Penniman to a poor family of 12 children in Macon, Georgia. Religion was a guiding force in his family, which attended Pentecostal, Baptist and African Methodist Episcopal churches. His faith was so deeply ingrained that at times it would overwhelm his rock career.His first performances were as a child in his church choir and his earliest inspirations were gospel singers, including Sister Rosetta Tharpe, who let a young Richard open her show when she stopped in Macon. A singer named Esquerita also influenced Richard’s fashion and manic musical style.He first went on the road in the late 1940s, performing in medicine shows and drag shows and with bands.Richard first recorded in the early 1950s and became a dominating force on the music charts starting in 1956 with hits such as “Tutti Frutti,” “Rip It Up,” “Slippin’ and Slidin’, and “Good Golly Miss Molly.” All were infused with the frantic rhythm of a runaway train.“Shining like a quasar, the most intensely radiant object in the cosmos, he seems to tap a mystical source of mental power that is only accessible to great preachers and shamans,” McCartney wrote in the preface to the 1994 biography “The Life and Times of Little Richard.”But Richard’s career took a turn in 1957 when he decided to abandon rock in the middle of a two-week tour of Australia.Richard told a biographer that he saw a fireball shoot across the sky during an outdoor performance in Sydney and took it as a sign from God to change his life. He said he later determined the fireball was the launch of Russia’s Sputnik satellite.A few months later, however, Richard was a student at a Bible college in Alabama. For a while he played only gospel music but slipped back into rock ‘n’ roll, sharing a bill with the young Beatles in Hamburg, Germany, in 1962.It was a pattern that persisted for years as Little Richard moved between rock ‘n’ roll, alcohol, cocaine and heroin abuse and Christianity and gospel music. He would go on to become an ordained Seventh Day Adventist minister and eventually worked gospel and rock both into his shows, along with a little preaching.“I talk about my life as a homosexual and a drug addict because I think it is right to tell people what God has done for me,” he wrote in his autobiography, “The Life and Times of Little Richard.”Richard was among the first inductees into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1986 but missed the ceremony because he was recovering from an auto accident. Rolling Stone magazine ranked him No. 8 on its list of 100 greatest entertainers of all time and he received a lifetime achievement Grammy in 1993.“Little Richard bent gender, upset segregationist fault lines and founded a tradition of rock dadaists devoted to the art of self-creation,” a Rolling Stone critic said. “He went with the inspiration of the moment, be it divine or hormonal, and caromed like a shiny, cracked pinball between God, sex and rock ‘n’ roll.”As a minister, Richard officiated at weddings for Bruce Springsteen, Demi Moore, Bruce Willis, Cyndi Lauper and other celebrities.Richard suffered a heart attack in 2013 and hip problems required him to use a wheelchair at times.In a post on Instagram on Saturday, Richard’s longtime guitarist Kelvin Holly said, “Rest in peace, Richard. This one really stings.”“My thoughts and prayers go out to all my bandmates and fans all over the world. Richard truly was the king!”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rock-n-roll-pioneer-little-richard-dies-at-age-87/story-Kwx1LKDLuetI4gNh2nEzCI.html
10-05-2020||World||UK PM Boris Johnson to set out Covid-19 warning system in public address||Boris Johnson will unveil a new virus alert system, similar to how the government currently communicates terror threat levels, in Sunday’s address to Britain that will set out some of the conditions for removing restrictions on the economy.The five-level alerts range from one (green), which would enable life to return to normal, to five (red). England is on the verge of improving from level four to three, which indicates that the Covid-19 infection rate isn’t increasing significantly, Johnson is expected to say. A new mantra is also set to make its debut: “Stay alert, control the virus and save lives.”“We will take the decisions that continue to save lives and protect the NHS, proceeding with maximum caution and maximum conditionality,” Johnson will say, according to a government official.Johnson will urge workers and businesses to stay alert by following social distancing rules, potentially angering some backbenchers in his Conservative Party who want a swift end to the lockdown that has scarred the economy. A person familiar with the matter earlier suggested that rules may not change significantly until June, when small shops may be allowed to reopen.The government will also announce long-awaited measures to deal with people flying or sailing into the country. Travellers, including Britons returning from abroad, will be told to self-isolate for 14 days as part of the government’s plans to try to avoid a second peak of the coronavirus.The new rules, set to kick in next month, will force travellers to declare where they plan to stay while they’re in isolation. Anyone found breaking the rules faces a fine of as much as 1,000 pounds or possible deportation.The measures are likely to heighten criticism that the government was slow to react to contain the pandemic, which has now killed more than 31,000 people in the U.K. -- the highest toll in Europe.Even in late March, an influential group of cross-party lawmakers asked the government why it hadn’t set out plans to better monitor people arriving at the nation’s airports and ports.For the world’s beleaguered airline industry, the measures give travelers yet another reason to think twice before taking to the skies and will probably end Britons’ plans of holidaying abroad this summer.British Airways, which has London’s Heathrow airport -- Europe’s busiest with some 80.9 million passengers a year -- as its home, is cutting 12,000 jobs, and Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd. is seeking to stave off collapse.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-boris-johnson-to-set-out-covid-19-warning-system-in-public-address/story-tw7IMd8cAXzdhEPObvt3HP.html
10-05-2020||World||Covid-19: Major US airlines endorse temperature checks for passengers||A major U.S. airline trade group on Saturday said it backed the U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) checking the temperatures of passengers and customer-facing employees during the coronavirus pandemic.Airlines for America, which represents the largest U.S. airlines including American Airlines, United Airlines , Delta Air Lines and Southwest Airlines, said the checks “will add an extra layer of protection for passengers as well as airline and airport employees. Temperature checks also will provide additional public confidence that is critical to relaunching air travel and our nation’s economy.”A U.S. official said Saturday no decision has been made on whether to mandate the checks, but said the issue is the subject of extensive talks among government agencies and with U.S. airlines and added a decision could potentially be made as early as next week.One possible route would be for a pilot project or to initially begin temperature checks at the largest U.S. airports. Questions remain about what the government would do if someone had a high temperature and was turned away from a flight.U.S. officials said the temperature checks would not eliminate the risk of coronavirus cases but could act as a deterrent to prevent people who were not feeling well from travelling.TSA Administrator David Pekoske told employees during a town hall meeting Wednesday that no decision had been made regarding possible temperature checks of passengers at airports and that questions remained about where such checks might take place and which agency might perform them.“It’s been a discussion that’s been ongoing for several weeks now,” he said.A TSA spokesman did not immediately comment Saturday.Frontier Airlines said on Thursday it would begin temperature screenings for all passengers and crew members on June 1 and bar anyone with a temperature at or exceeding 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit (38 C).The move, the first among major U.S. airlines, followed the industry mandating facial coverings for all passengers and heightened cleaning procedures to address coronavirus concerns.The airline group said having temperature checks performed by the TSA “will ensure that procedures are standardized.”The endorsement comes amid signs of a modest travel rebound from historic lows. On Friday, TSA screened 215,444 people at airport checkpoints, the first time the number topped 200,000 since March 26. But that is still a fraction of the 2.6 million screened on the equivalent day last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-major-us-airlines-endorse-temperature-checks-for-passengers/story-PnWwStFz2VXI2f773PASPL.html
10-05-2020||World||US FDA gives emergency use approval to Covid-19 antigen tests||The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Friday issued an emergency use authorisation (EUA) for Covid-19 antigen tests. It is a new type of test that is easy to carry out and can help with early detection of the virus, right at the doctor’s clinic itself.This test can quickly detect fragments of proteins found on or within the Sars-CoV-2 virus by testing samples collected from the nasal cavity using swabs. The FDA has issued the EUA to Quidel Corporation for what is called Sofia 2 SARS Antigen FIA. The test has been approved for laboratory use as well as for point-of-care testing at some facilities.Antigen tests are very specific, but are not as sensitive as molecular PCR tests. This means positive results from antigen tests are highly accurate, but there is a higher chance of false negatives as well - so negative results don’t rule out the infection, the FDA said in a statement on Saturday. Negative results from an antigen test may need to be confirmed with an RT PCR test prior to making treatment decisions.“Its good to know that now there is an antigen test for Covid-19, but it remains to be seen how accurate it is. Antigen tests are rapid tests which turn positive earlier, which means they can detect an active infection... The greatest benefit of an antigen test is early diagnosis with rapid testing. But the kit has to be of high quality for the antigen test to be accurate,” said Dr Anurag Agrawal, director of CSIR Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology.Dr Shobha Broor, former head of the department of virology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, said, “The antigen test can detect antigen of the virus. The Sars-CoV-2 has spikes, which are antigens that stimulate immune response in the body. These tests turn positive earlier but sensitivity is less compared to RT PCR. But these tests can be done anywhere even in a doctor’s office.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-fda-gives-emergency-use-approval-to-covid-19-antigen-tests/story-83QtFohVXtoBJAv6T9bwYM.html

The fire has since been put out, the authorities said.Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, wrote on Twitter that all patients had been evacuated and would be transferred to other hospitals.“The causes of this incident will be thoroughly investigated,” Sobyanin wrote.Moscow and several other regions have been on lockdown since late March to stem the spread of the coronavirus, which has so far infected nearly 200,000 people and caused more than 1,800 deaths in Russia.More than half of the country’s cases and deaths have been recorded in Moscow, a sprawling city of 12.7 million.The number of Russian coronavirus cases this week overtook French and German infections to become the fifth-highest in the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fire-breaks-out-at-moscow-coronavirus-hospital-one-dead/story-qU3twM2wuKrtTcFqSTc23M.html

But the queue of applicants from India for employment-based Green Cards is already very long, with waiting periods of more than 100 years at the current rate of disposal of cases, and it could not be ascertained if Indian medial professionals will be able circumvent this queue.“Consider this: One-sixth of our health care workforce is foreign-born. Immigrant nurses and doctors play a vital role in our healthcare system, and their contributions are now more crucial than ever. Where would we be in this pandemic without them?” said Senator Richard Durbin, the Democratic who cosponsored the legislation, in a statement. “This bipartisan, targeted, and timely legislation will strengthen our health care workforce and improve health care access for Americans in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic.”“This proposal would simply reallocate a limited number of unused visas from prior years for doctors and nurses who are qualified to help in our fight against Covid-19,” said Senator David Perdue, a Republican, in a statement.Democrat Chris Coons and Republican Tod Young were the other two senators backing the bill.The Trump administration has suspended all immigrant visas for 60 days to ensure Americans hit by record layoffs caused by the Covid-19 lockdown get the first shot at remaining jobs or those that become available as businesses reopen. But physicians, nurses and other healthcare professionals were among those exempted from the temporary ban.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-lawmakers-propose-bill-to-bring-foreign-medical-professionals/story-h8MsYTa591No8CtW3fGoEM.html

They have to be removed. Even clothes in their houses have to be thoroughly washed. We are yet to assess the contamination of ground water in these villages. So, it is always better to allow people only after ensuring that everything is safe and secure in the villages after getting green signals from the experts,” Reddy said.The chief minister, too, directed the officials to see that the villagers were allowed only after taking proper sanitation and safety measures. “It requires a massive sanitation drive. A large number of animal carcasses have to be removed from the area and drains have to be cleaned, so that they would not pose further problems to the villagers,” the minister said.Till such time, the evacuees have to stay put in their relief camps. “We cannot tell immediately as to how long they would have to stay there, but we hope to restore normalcy in the area in a couple of days,” Gautam Reddy said.The minister said the anxiety of the evacuees to return to their villages was understandable, as they were worried about their belongings. “They all left homes unlocked and ran for their safety on the fateful day. And the police had to break open the doors of some other houses to bring out people who had fallen unconscious while they were asleep,” he said. He said directions had been issued to the Visakhapatnam police authorities lock the houses which were deserted by the people and keep a vigil on the other houses whose doors were broken. “We shall ensure that their belongings are safe,” Reddy said.Visakhapatnam district medical and health officer Tirumala Rao said 411 patients were undergoing treatment in various hospitals and many of them had completely recovered. “We shall discharge them and send them back, only after getting clearance from the government,” he said.The chief minister asked the officials to complete the distribution of compensation that he had announced for the bereaved families, the affected persons and the villagers who were evacuated from their homes on account of the disaster.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/styrene-gas-leak-survivors-will-have-to-wait-some-more-days-to-return-home/story-gehQWN1jGe1JUyC1ajrxVO.html

As everyone was occupied with their works, the six-year-old hopped into a car parked outside. As soon as he stepped in, the door closed he was trapped inside the vehicle.“With all doors and windows of the car closed, the minor probably suffocated inside and collapsed on the seat.

Out of the 1,786 cases reported till May 9, 85% of the cases were registered in these three red zone districts. Another red zone district, East Midnapore, has registered a decline in containment areas.“While the number of containment zones in South 24-Parganas has shot up from one to 30 in the past one week, the number of positive Covid-19 cases in Hooghly has shot up from 40 to 71 in the last one week,” said a senior official of the state government who was not willing to be named. This has prompted the state government to deploy three expert teams in the districts of North 24-Parganas, Hooghly and South 24 Parganas to identify gaps in containment zones of the three districts. Along with Kolkata and Howrah, cases are being reported on a daily basis from these three districts. “Each team will have four doctors, all experts in community medicine. The team will look into quality control and supervise the teams that are already deployed in containment areas. Increase in containment areas and rise in Covid figures in a district are an indication that there could be some gaps in containment zones. The expert teams will try to find out these gaps,” said the official.The teams will check whether samples of high-risk patents, SARI (Severe Acute Respiratory Infection) patients and ILI (influenza-like illnesses) patients are being tested, identify clusters from weekly reports and comment on the measures in containment areas, the official said. There are at least 566 containment zones in the state. Out of them, Kolkata has 326 containment areas. North 24-Parganas, with 92 such areas, comes next, followed by Howrah with 76 containment areas. South 24-Parganas and Hooghly have 30 and 23 zones, respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-sends-teams-to-plug-gaps-in-containment-zones-of-three-districts/story-gBg5aumw2SO01K6pzp7xdK.html
10-05-2020||India||Western disturbance brings dust storm, thunderstorm in northwest India||Dust storms and thunderstorms were reported in several parts of northwest India, including Delhi, on Sunday with the weather department attributing them to a western disturbance (WD) and a simultaneous cyclonic circulation.Thunderstorms may continue over the western Himalayan region and some parts of the northern plains till May 12, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD)’s Sunday bulletin.Another fresh western disturbance is likely to affect the western Himalayan region from May 14. It is likely to bring rain and thundershowers to the northern plains on May 15 and 16, the weather department said.There is also an orange alert for parts of Uttarakhand, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir for May 13 and 14 when thundershowers and gusty winds are expected. An orange alert implies that agencies should be prepared for extreme weather.The western disturbance on May 14 will be the fourth such weather event in May. Because of consecutive western disturbances and associated clouds and strong winds, the maximum temperature has not risen in most parts of northwest India as it normally does in this time of the year.“In Delhi, we record maximum temperature of up to 45 degrees during this time of the year. But this May, we have recorded 40.8 degrees Celsius only yesterday (Saturday). Maximum temperature will fall now by a couple of degrees till the impact of WDs weakens. We are not expecting rain or thundershowers in Delhi on Monday, but it will remain cloudy. The northwesterly winds due to WDs are meeting easterly winds in the lower levels — which is enhancing thunderstorm activity here,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, the regional weather forecasting centre.According to him, the maximum temperature may not peak until May 17. Following the dust storms and thundershowers on Sunday, the maximum temperature in Delhi fell to 35.5 degrees Celsius, four degrees below normal.“In April or May, the intensity of WDs reduce. There could be many reasons for this unusual pattern of active WDs this year. It could be linked to European climate anomalies because WDs originate in the Mediterranean, mid latitude circulation features may also be impacting,” M Rajeevan, secretary, ministry of earth sciences, told HT in April.Western disturbances are low pressure systems that generally originate over the Mediterranean region and are known to bring winter rain in India. Their intensity reduces in summer when they move to upper latitudes. Scientists say changes in their pattern may be due to weather anomalies in Europe, or they could also be linked to favourable sea temperatures over the Pacific.Due to a trough (area of low pressure), scattered rain and thundershowers are also likely over central and south peninsular India during next four-five days. Thunderstorms accompanied with lightning, hail and gusty winds (30-40 kmph) at some places are also likely over these regions in the same period. Heavy rainfall is likely over some places in Kerala and Tamil Nadu on Monday, and over Kerala and Coastal Karnataka on May 13 and 14. Thundershowers will continue over northeast India during next four-five days, the IMD’s bulletin added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/western-disturbance-brings-dust-storm-thunderstorm-in-northwest-india/story-QRyyD3RZjHiqY6Gsmtal4K.html

He also asked senior bureaucrats to go to the three districts. The chief minister directed infrastructure and industrial development commissioner (IIDC) Alok Kumar, and principal secretary, medical education, Rajneesh Dubey to camp in Agra. He also said he wanted a senior doctor of SGPGIMS (Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow) and senior police officers to go to Agra. Besides, he asked principal secretary, irrigation, T Venkatesh to camp in Meerut with senior health, medical education and police officers. The details of the officials who would be sent to Kanpur were not mentioned.The chief minister asked officials to make all ventilators functional, prepare a list of anaesthetists and train them to operate ventilators. Emphasising on boosting the immunity of the general public, he asked the officers concerned and the respective district administrations to encourage the use of Ayush Kavach Covid app created by the state’s ayush department. “This would help and guide people towards immunity enhancement because it has a lot of Ayurveda and yoga-related tips,” Adityanath said.He said a list of migrants returning to UP should be arranged so that the government could manage their safe homecoming. The state government is committed to the safety of the returning migrants, he said, adding that it must be ensured that no migrant would have to take a long walk home. Laying stress on strict adherence to the lockdown, he asked officials to ensure enhanced alertness on both inter-state and international borders of UP. All Covid-19 hospitals must have sufficient PPE (personal protective equipment), N-95 masks, sanitisers and other related paraphernalia, he said. All the community kitchens must maintain the highest level of cleanliness and they should be sanitised frequently, he said. These kitchens must supply good and sufficient food to the needy, he added. While all migrants must be screened, those with symptoms must be tested, he said. Those who test positive should be provided with the best of treatment, he said, adding that healthy migrants should be sent home with ration kits.Along with the Team-11 officers, medical education minister Suresh Khanna; health minister Jai Pratap Singh and minister of state for health Atul Garg were present at the meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-yogi-asks-high-level-teams-to-camp-in-agra-meerut-kanpur/story-clb1KIIoizTVS9VdRLdnTO.html

Earlier in the day, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut had said that Thackeray was not willing to contest the legislative council polls unless elected unopposed, adding that the ruling alliance partner Congress was firm on contesting two seats, which was likely to force a contest.The BJP has fielded four candidates. The coalition government in Maharashtra had earlier asked Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari to nominate Thackeray to the legislative council.On April 30, the Governor shut the nomination door on Thackeray and requested the Election Commission to hold elections for nine seats to the state legislative council at the earliest to end the political uncertainty in the state.Thackeray, who took over as chief minister on November 28, is not a member of either House of the legislature and must be elected to one of the houses by May 28 to keep his job.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-cm-uddhav-thackeray-set-to-enter-legislative-council-unopposed-after-congress-withdraws-nominee/story-zHTRXcuXsdukslm115oO9N.html
10-05-2020||India||In UP villages, migrant workers allege harassment upon return||Fear of the coronavirus disease and the stigma associated with the Covid-19 are stalking several Uttar Pradesh villages where migrant workers have returned.These migrants say that they, and even their family members in some cases, are being singled out, and harassed by villagers who suspect them to be carriers of the infection.Armed with sticks, a group of villagers last Tuesday allegedly surrounded Shekhar, a migrant worker who returned to his village in Basti district of eastern UP. The villagers were angry because he had ventured out of the primary school, where he was being quarantined, to relieve himself, Shekhar said.“The villagers were scared of contracting the coronavirus disease, so they didn’t touch me. Otherwise, I would have been killed that day,” Shekhar said.“They hurled abuses at me and threatened to beat me if I ventured out of the school,” he added. Shekhar said he had not been tested for Covid-19. He also claimed that he did not have any symptoms of the infection.Misconceptions, lack of information and caste system prevalent in villages had made things worse, some of them alleged.Ravi Maurya, a migrant worker of Prayagraj, who returned to his village by a ‘Shramik Special’ train, said, “Most of the villagers who have returned home belong to the lower castes. The upper caste villagers harass us more. An upper caste villager started abusing me one day just because I was standing on the roof of my house. Even though I am not infected, the villagers fear that I will spread the coronavirus even from roof of my house.”Migrants from villages in Barabanki, Ayodhya and other districts also complained of similar harassment.Dinesh Verma, a migrant worker from Pratapgarh district, alleged that a local grocery shop owner asked his wife to not visit his shop. “I have to request my relatives to help me in procuring things of daily need,” he said.For its part, the government has asked the village heads to ensure that the migrants adhere to home quarantine.Pankaj Yadav, husband of the village head of Mahadewa village in Basti, helps his wife in day-to-day work. The task includes asking migrant labourers to stay home and other villagers to stay away from them.“It would have been much easier to keep the migrant labourers in quarantine at government schools. Ensuring quarantine at home is very difficult and it also leads to problems with other villagers,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-up-villages-migrant-workers-allege-harassment-upon-return/story-A7b4WvgCpMAuTIoaYqtMIK.html

A slum dweller claimed that the deer was being chased by a predator.A seven member rescue team including animal welfare groups from Resqink Association for Wildlife Welfare (RAWW), Plants and Animals Welfare Society (PAWS-Mumbai), and forest officials rescued the animal in a couple of hours.“We are not sure about the cause of the sudden fall though there are several rumours. It is an unusual rescue,” said Jitendra Ramgaokar, deputy conservator of forest (Thane). “The deer fell from a height into the settlement located at the base of a hill. The animal was in shock for a while, and could not move inside Karan Parihar’s home (a resident of the slum) for some time.”The chital, or spotted deer, which is found in SGNP, was taken to the rescue centre. “The deer only had minor injuries. A full checkup will be done and based on the presence of its herd in the same rescue area, the animal will be released,” said Vijay Barabde, range forest officer from SGNP.This is the second such incident in less than a month. Another spotted deer which jumped from a hill in Hanuman Tekdi on April 21 died due to the impact. “In both cases the animals were being chased by a predator and to save themselves jumped from the hill,” said Aaba Kubal, a resident of the slum who informed animal rescue groups.Pawan Sharma, president, RAWW said, “The animal ended up in a tough spot. The joint rescue was completed amidst hundreds of slum dwellers who had gathered.”“On April 21, the deer had fallen from a great height but in the latest incident it was a much shorter jump and the tin-shed broke his fall,” said Sunish Subramanian Kunju, PAWS-Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/deer-gets-kiss-of-life-after-crashing-through-roof-of-mumbai-slum/story-SN6rSQQ4dh8YKNkLBHZWiN.html

All the States/UTs have been requested by the central government to notify and upload the assigned three types of Covid dedicated facilities on their websites for public information and 32 States/UTs have already uploaded the information while the rest are in the process of doing it. In view of the need for further increasing the testing capacity for Covid -19 at National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), the procurement of a high-throughput machine as per the recommendations of an Empowered Group was approved. The Cobas 6800 testing machine has been successfully installed at NCDC here, the statement said. NCDC is providing support for testing of samples from Delhi, NCR, Ladakh, Jammu and Kashmir and various other states, as per need. Presently the testing capacity at NCDC is about 300-350 tests per day and with Cobas 6800, which has a capacity to test around 1,200 samples in 24 hours, the capacity at NCDC will be significantly enhanced. So far, a total of 19,357 people have been cured, including 1,511 patients who recovered in the last 24 hours, the health ministry said. This takes the total recovery rate to 30.76 per cent. The death toll due to Covid -19 rose to 2,109 and the number of cases climbed to 62,939 in the country on Sunday, registering an increase of 128 deaths and 3,277 cases in the last 24 hours, according to the ministry. The health ministry has also explained the basis of classification of Covid -19 dedicated facilities into the three categories. The Dedicated Covid Hospitals are hospitals that offer comprehensive care primarily for those who have been clinically assigned as severe. These hospitals shall have fully equipped ICUs, ventilators and beds with assured oxygen support. These hospitals shall have separate areas for suspect and confirmed cases. The Dedicated Covid Hospitals shall serve as referral centres for the Dedicated Covid Health Centres and the Covid Care Centres. The Dedicated Covid Health Centres are hospitals that offer care for all cases that have been clinically assigned as moderate. The DCHCs shall have separate areas for suspect and confirmed cases. These hospitals shall have beds with assured oxygen support and every DCHC is mapped to one or more Dedicated Covid Hospitals. The Covid Care Centres shall offer care only for cases that have been clinically assigned as mild or very mild cases or Covid suspect cases. These are makeshift facilities which may be set up by the States/UTs in hostels, hotels, schools, stadiums, lodges, etc., both public and private. These facilities shall have separate areas for suspected and confirmed cases.

Bihar labour resources minister Vijay Kumar Sinha said the changes were in accordance with the guidelines issued by the centre.“We are also going to relax some more provisions in the factories act (1948) to make it more flexible to attract investment in the state in the coming months and to generate employment. We have taken the decisions as per the guidelines issued by the central government. Our objective is to enhance productivity and also safeguard the interest of workers,” he said.Asked whether the new working hours will also apply to the people employed in retail shops, the minister said the ambit of the order might increase after weighing the situation in the coming weeks. “Once the situation eases a bit, we will be able to take a decision depending on the requirement. The ambit of relaxations might increase,” he said.Punjab government has already extended the daily working hours in factories from nine to 12, while Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh have amended labour laws to boost industrial activity and attract big-ticket investments.Deputy chief minister cum finance minister Sushil Kumar Modi told HT that several states have extended the working hours and the state government was studying the relaxations given by other states in relation to labour laws. Also Read: Some states put freeze on labour laws to get business goingAuthoritative sources said the state government’s labour and industries department has held wide-ranging discussions on the relaxations in labour laws and the factories act in the last few days to evolve a strategy for the optimum utilisation of labour, and also to attract more investment in the state given the rise of unemployment after the recent reverse migration of labour to Bihar during the lockdown following the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic.‘‘A few incentives would be given to industrial units for enhancing productivity,” said a senior officer in the industry department.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesThe state government has already kick-started commercial activity following the relaxations offered by the central government.As per official figures, 671 food processing units, 95 rubber and plastic units, 678 general services units and 408 industrial units under BIADA (Bihar Industrial Area Development Authority) have been working since permission for the resumption of industrial activities was granted.

Kurnool accounts for the maximum number of Covid-19 cases in Andhra Pradesh with 566 patients. 16 people have died after getting infected with coronavirus in Kurnool.The central team members Dr Madhumita Dubey and Dr Sanjay Sadhukhan, who toured Kurnool town in the morning, held a meeting with senior officials of the district to review the Covid-19 situation in the state in general and Kurnool in particular.Also read: 14 states see dip in number of active Covid-19 cases, shows dataDubey said the state government should come out with new appropriate strategies to contain the fast-spreading virus in tune with the growing number of cases. She suggested that testing, tracing, isolation and quarantine should be done faster and, if necessary, the government should take the help of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) for contact tracing.She advised the state government to enhance the capacity of human resources, quarantine centres, Covid-19 care centres and hospitals to face the challenges effectively in case there was a largescale outbreak of coronavirus in the coming days.The central team member appreciated the way Andhra Pradesh was leading in conducting tests in a big way, which was resulting in identifying more positive cases. So far, the state government ha conducted 1,73,735 Covid-19 tests, including 8,666 tests in the last 24 hours alone.Dubey said the central team had come to Kurnool to extend handholding to the state and the district administration in preventing any further spread of Covid-19. “After examining the situation in all aspects, we shall make appropriate recommendations to the state government,” she said.Professor Sadhukhan said since it was not possible for the government to continue the lockdown for an indefinite period, the government should mentally prepare the people to live with coronavirus after the lifting of the lockdown. “We need to educate the people on how to maintain self-restraint to prevent the spread of the virus,” he said.District collector G Veerapandian explained the efforts that are being made by the Kurnool district administration in containing the virus and to bring down the death rate. He said though the number of cases was going up in the district, the recovery was also equally faster.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/central-team-expresses-concern-over-growing-number-of-covid-19-cases-in-andhra-pradesh/story-HvG5oH5eAbjq9KOwR8fOkK.html
10-05-2020||India||An ‘upset’ Uddhav Thackeray won’t contest MLC polls if not elected unopposed: Sena||Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray is not willing to contest the legislative council polls due later this month unless elected unopposed, said senior Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut, adding that the ruling alliance partner Congress was firm on contesting two seats, which is likely to force a contest. Raut said that the ongoing political drama has upset the Shiv Sena chief, who has sent a message to Maharashtra Congress chief Balasaheb Thorat to withdraw party’s second candidate.Raut clarified that Uddhav is not afraid of contesting an election but the current situation doesn’t warrant political battles. He added that the legislative council polls for 9 seats on May 21 were being held to avoid a constitutional and political crisis in the state.Raut was referring to the constitutional requirement for a chief minister or a minister of the state to get elected to either of the two houses within six months of taking oath. Uddhav is currently not an MLA and his six months as Maharashtra CM come to an end on May 28. Late on Saturday night, Thorat announced that Rajkishor Modi, the party’s Beed district president, will be its second candidate. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has already fielded four candidates. The Nationalist Congress Party and the Shiv Sena have announced two candidates each. With Congress also fielding two candidates, it would require a contest between the candidates of the ruling coalition.“Do we tell people that while they are locked up in their homes; when there is a question mark over their livelihoods and health, political parties in Maharashtra cannot unanimously decide on an election? This would be a blot on Maharashtra’s tradition. Uddhav Thackeray never was and will never be interested in such politics. He is upset over this development. He wanted to contest only if it was unopposed. We are not scared of contesting, but this is not the time to contest elections. It is time to tackle the situation. We have taken this election out of no choice as the state was heading towards instability,” Raut told reporters on Sunday.He added that if there is voting on May 21, all 288 MLAs would have to come to Mumbai and it would not send a “good message” to the people of Maharashtra at a time when it is battling Covid-19.Also Read: Covid-19 cases double in Maharashtra in 9 days, tally now above 20,000Raut, however, added that there is no “tension” between the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) allies over the issue and all leaders are currently in talks with each other to find a middle ground. He also expressed confidence that the MLC elections will be contested unopposed.Clikc here for Coronavirus Live UpdatesThe Sena leader added that both BJP and Congress didn’t have adequate numbers to get all their candidates elected. “The BJP too does not have enough numbers to get their fourth candidate elected. It is their responsibility as well that election is held unopposed. They [BJP] do not have enough votes for their candidate; they would have to engage in horse-trading. They should also think if an election should be forced upon Maharashtra at such a time,” Raut said adding that Thackeray and Devendra Fadnavis should discuss this issue.“I think Devendra Fadnavis and chief minister Uddhav Thackeray should discuss this issue. I am not saying they should take a step back or we should. The election should happen unopposed. The chief minister of a state is in the fray. The situation in the state is serious and people want a stable leadership. At such a time, nobody should take advantage of the situation to suit their politics.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shiv-sena-says-an-upset-uddhav-thackeray-won-t-contest-mlc-polls-if-not-elected-unopposed/story-xcaNqSJOCgqiT1aVKA6AXI.html

Most of them hail from Hyderabad while some were from Nizamabad and Karimnagar districts.“Only those who could afford to bear their travel expenses and also for their stay in paid quarantine centres in Hyderabad were brought from Kuwait. Those who cannot have to stay back,” E Chitti Babu, a senior official in-charge of Telangana NRI cell in state secretariat, said.He said the charges for paid quarantine facilities range from Rs 5,000 to Rs 30,000 for the 14-day period, depending on the facilities for the NRIs. “For an ordinary accommodation, it is Rs 5,000, for a two-star hotel facility, it is Rs 15,000 and for three-star accommodation, it is Rs 30,000,” he said.Chitti Babu said a couple of more flights, one from the US and another from the UK, would be bringing stranded Telugus to Hyderabad. “Similarly, some more flights from Abu Dhabi and Dubai would also be operated for the Telangana people,” he said.But thousands of people, who had gone to the Gulf countries in search of livelihood, are not in a position to return because they are not in a position to bear the expenses.According to P Basanth Reddy, president of the Hyderabad-based Telangana Gulf Migrants Welfare Association president, many people from Telangana stranded in Kuwait had registered their names with the local authorities for returning to India, but backed out after coming to know that they will have to pay quarantine charges as well. “Thousands of poor migrant labourers from Telangana, who have been languishing in the Gulf countries like Dubai, Kuwait, Bahrain and UAE, have not been getting their wages for months. How can they be expected to bear their own expenses for their return in these present conditions?” Reddy asked.A migrant worker Ganga Reddy stranded in Dammam in Saudi Arabia told Hindustan Times that the situation in his place was horrible and many people are desperate to return home. “We are afraid that we might contract Covid-19 and we are desperately looking up to the Telangana government to help us come back,” Reddy, who is from Nizamabad district, said.Basanth Reddy said his association was trying for sponsors to bring as many as people as possible from the Gulf countries. “We are also helping the families of these migrants back home, as they are in utter poverty,” he said.All India Congress Committee spokesman Dasoju Sravan demanded that the Telangana government bring back stranded labourers in the Gulf countries free of cost. He said there more than 12-15 lakh workers from Telangana, including both men and women in the Gulf countries.Many of the labourers are being laid off from their employment due to Covid-19 pandemic. Most of them do not have access to proper livelihood and medical care and are compelled to live in most hazardous conditions and are worried about the spread of Covid-19.“In these circumstances, the government of Telangana should coordinate and collaborate with central government and bring back whosoever is desirous to return to India at free of cost. It is improper on the part of the government to charge airfares to return to India as the labour is already in most vulnerable situation without income,” Sravan said.The Telangana NRI cell in-charge, however, ruled out the possibility of the government bearing the travel expenses of the Gulf migrants. “We have no such plans as of now,” Chitti Babu said.Meanwhile, the returnees from Kuwait were screened thoroughly at every stage in the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport before they were shifted to the quarantine centres of their choice in the early hours of Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cash-crunch-forces-many-telangana-expats-in-persian-gulf-to-drop-travel-plans/story-6rlwvGy5XxMmpJE3LFDUSO.html

The senior BJP leader died in August last year after a cardiac arrest.“Happy Mother’s Day @SushmaSwaraj. Miss you with every breath Ma (sic),” her daughter Bansuri Swaraj tweeted on Sunday.Sushma Swaraj had served as the external affairs minister from May 26, 2014, to May 2019 and Swas India’s first full-time woman foreign minister. Indira Gandhi held additional charge of the ministry when she was prime minister.Swaraj was replaced as external affairs minister in the second term of the Narendra Modi government by former diplomat S Jaishankar.Swaraj entered the Haryana assembly in 1977 and became a minister in the state cabinet at the age of 25.

10-05-2020||India||India needs ‘whole-of-govt approach’ for ‘strategic uncertainties’: Army Chief||The time has come for India to adopt a “whole-of-government approach” in decisively confronting the “strategic uncertainties” looming on its horizon as well as non-traditional threats like pandemics, Army Chief Gen Manoj Mukund Naravane has said, strongly pitching for broadening the country’s national security doctrine. Talking about complex geo-political power play in India’s neighbourhood, Gen Naravane said the Indian armed forces are determined to “cement” the country’s reputation as a net security provider in the region. “There is an entire spectrum of strategic uncertainties that looms on the horizon and a whole-of-government approach is the need of the hour to deal with them,” the Army Chief told PTI. Though Gen Naravane did not elaborate, his comments came in the backdrop of Pakistan-supported Taliban’s aim for a role in power structure in Afghanistan and China’s persistent efforts to expand military ties with countries like Sri Lanka, Nepal, Myanmar and the Maldives. “In dealing with issues of global nature, the armed forces with their inherent capabilities and capacities will cement India’s reputation as a net security provider in the region, taking security as a holistic concept,” Gen Naravane said. India is learnt to have been worried over the extremely fragile and dynamic situation in Afghanistan after the US sealed a historic deal with the Taliban providing for withdrawal of American troops from the war-ravaged country. The Army Chief further said that India needs to broaden its understanding of national security and must examine non-traditional threats like pandemics “de-novo” as they have the potential to inflict severe damage on the country. “We need to act and prepare ourselves accordingly.” He said the “traditional threats” facing India remained “unabated” and the armed forces are fully geared up to deal with them. Gen Naravane said that there has been no let up in Indian Army’s “posture” while guarding the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China because of the coronavirus pandemic. The LAC is the de-facto border between the two countries. “Along the LAC, patrolling continues as before though we have put the ceremonial border personnel meetings on hold. There is also greater reliance on hotlines,” he said. The Chief of Army Staff said the effort has been to adhere to the directives issued by both the governments following two informal summits between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping. “As far as our deployment along the border with China is concerned, the focus is on mutual understanding and respect for the sanctity of LAC and ensuring that no untoward incident takes place due to our differing perceptions of the LAC,” he said. “Our focus has been to ensure all misunderstandings are mitigated amicably through discussions and existing mechanisms,” Gen Naravane said. The India-China border dispute covers 3,488-km-long Line of Actual Control. China claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of southern Tibet while India contests it. Both sides have been asserting that pending the final resolution of the boundary issue, it is necessary to maintain peace and tranquillity in the border areas. Gen Naravane said troops deployed along borders in remote and high altitude areas are at minimum risk of getting infected by the coronavirus as the areas are inaccessible to ordinary people. He said only troops who are medically validated as being coronavirus-free are being allowed to replace the personnel deployed in key formations and frontiers. “You have to keep in mind that in most of these places, due to the nature of deployment and living arrangements, social distancing is not feasible. However, wherever possible, social distancing and hygiene measures are being strictly enforced,” he said. Gen Naravane said ensuring safety of his force from the pandemic is his foremost priority as the Army will be able to assist the country in dealing with the challenge if the troops are fighting fit. “The need for maintaining social distancing and hygiene norms assumes significant importance in the forces because of the higher density of personnel living inside barracks and the increased attendant possibility of the virus spreading within the forces,” he said. He said all the units and formations have been issued comprehensive instructions to maintain social distancing wherever feasible and adhere to highest hygiene standards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-needs-whole-of-govt-approach-for-strategic-uncertainties-army-chief-gen-naravane/story-X7UphthriaBEhOJXAZOGVL.html

We have so far brought back 26,054 of our stranded residents from other states in state transport corporation buses,” he said.He said that most of the people who have returned to Uttarakhand were stranded in Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Punjab. The minister also informed that the state government has been in talks with the Centre for running at least five special trains to evacuate stranded residents from far away states. “We have demanded trains from Thiruvananthapuram, Hyderabad, Pune, Surat and Ahmedabad from the Centre. The talks are in the final stage and we have got oral approval but are waiting for a written approval which will be the final one. Once it is received then the special trains would start in the next few days,” said Kaushik.He also spoke about the measures being taken for the evacuees to ensure that the infection doesn’t spread in the state. “After bringing the people to the designated centres at Haridwar or US Nagar, they are being screened for possible Covid-19 infection. As we have to do it thoroughly, it is taking some time -- about one or two days before the migrants are allowed to go to their homes. I want to appeal to all those people to have some patience as it is for their own health and safety as well as others in their neighbourhood,” said Kaushik. He also said that the government has earmarked adequate budget for village heads to make proper quarantine arrangements if any migrant in their village doesn’t have the facility for home quarantine. “The village heads will be responsible for making quarantine arrangements for them in nearby schools or any community centre,” he said.Apart from the residents who are returning to Uttarakhand, Kaushik said that about 25,730 people of other states stranded in Uttarakhand have also registered to return to their home states. “We have already sent 7,207 of them to their states in our state buses. We are making arrangements for the others in coordination with governments of their respective states,” he said adding that about 40,714 people stranded in others districts within the state have also been sent to their home districts. The minister said there has been no response from the Bengal government on the evacuation of 600 of its people in Uttarakhand.“We have communicated to the West Bengal government several occasions but haven’t received any proper response from them. Their residents here want to return and are tense. However, we are helping them in every possible manner by providing them food and other help. We are even counselling them to have patience,” said Kaushik.Earlier on Saturday evening, chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat in a video message said that he had spoken to the Centre for a special train from Delhi where about 50,000 of Uttarakhand residents are stranded. “The ministry of railways has given permission for it and the train may soon start to bring our residents back. We have already made an advance payment of Rs 50 lakh to the Indian Railways for special trains so that they don’t charge the residents for a ticket. We are committed to bring all our residents back to their home,” said Rawat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-evacuates-30-000-migrants-awaits-five-special-trains/story-KtshR8JFFmQO6S6uFbRtaI.html

This is unprecedented words that has beem used here. this is unacceptable. #backoffchina,” tweeted another.CCTN had on May 2 posted a tweet of an ‘extraordinary halo’ over Mount Everest. However, the words claiming Mount Qomolangma was the world’s highest peak ‘located in China’s Tibet Autonomous Region’ have drawn aggression from people with some of them also urging the Government of Nepal to take strict action over the social media post.Twitter users asserted that Mount Everest was in Nepal and not in China and that it will always be the ‘pride of Nepalese’. Some even shared memes of China’s President Xi Jinping and tagged Nepal’s government to bring a spotlight on the claim.“Dear @CGTNOfficial Mount Everest is in the Nepal. Not in china’s Tibet. So Please stop spreading Fake News,” said a user from Kathmandu.“Mount Everest lies in Nepal, not China. Discard such false notions Xi. #FreeTibet,” said another.“#backoffchina Stop Spreading false new Mt.Everst is located in Nepal not in China,” tweeted the third.As per experts, Nepal and China had signed a border dispute resolution agreement in 1960 according to which it was decided that Mount Everest will be divided, and southern part of it will belong to Nepal and Northern part to Tibet Autonomous Region which China claims as its own.Speaking to ANI about the CGTN tweet, Professor of Chinese studies at Jawahar Lal Nehru University, Srikant Kondapali, said, “It is a not a new thing, China is trying to consolidate its claims on Tibet and Everest.”“The Everest on the Tibet side is treacherous and very less used by the Chinese side, there is no trace of tourism from that side, as it is very steep and also visa is an issue,” Srikant added.The majority of tourism and expeditions on Mount Everest take place from Nepal, now with help of technology, China is also developing Tibet side of Everest and recent projection by the official website clearly reflects the ambitious plans of China and this move may become a bone of contention between Nepal and China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/netizens-in-india-nepal-troll-beijing-after-fake-claims-on-mount-everest/story-cvaywLkLQFDOKl5qOusKoM.html

The meeting will also be attended by home minister Amit Shah, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan along with senior officials from the centre including the home and health secretary.Hindustan Times had today reported that this meeting will likely discuss the next stage in the exit from the nationwide lockdown and will focus on a further increase in economic activities and also on ways to tackle the pandemic in containment zones.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesCabinet secretary Rajeev Gauba held a meeting with the chief secretaries and the health secretaries of all states on Sunday to review the status of Covid-19 management. According to the Centre, the states were in favour of a two-pronged strategy to increase economic activities while containing the disease. Gauba had also held two meetings with state officials on Saturday to identify areas for reopening after May 17- when the third phase of lockdown ends. The meetings also discussed the situation arising out of a sharp rise in positive cases in a few pockets of the country.Some officials familiar with the context of the prime minister’s meeting said more concessions were likely to be introduced after May 17, but the number of Covid-19 hotspots and containment zones is unlikely to change.The government had classified all 773 districts in the country into three zones- Red, Orange and Green, to indicate the level of economic activity and restrictions in place in each of these districts. 130 districts were identified as part of the Red Zone, 284 as Orange Zone and 319 as Green Zone.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19On Sunday, the total number of coronavirus cases in India climbed to 62,939, while total number of fatalities rose to 2,109.The prime minister’s meeting with chief ministers will also happen in the backdrop of two tragedies- the Vizag Styrene gas leak case that killed 13 people and led to injuries to several others and the Aurangabad train accident in which 16 migrant workers were killed. The National Disaster Management Authority issued guidelines after the Vishakapatnam incident for restarting industries after the lockdown to prevent a repeat of such industrial accidents.The meeting with the chief ministers is likely to also focus on the flight of migrant workers, which presents a difficulty for a full-scale resumption of manufacturing, industrial and construction activities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-narendra-modi-to-meet-cms-tomorrow-review-phased-exit-from-lockdown/story-rN8RmOrJUkTah6EEHY7WgI.html
10-05-2020||India||Govt sends warship with medical teams to Indian Ocean nations||India has despatched a warship with two medical teams and medical supplies to assist authorities in the Maldives, Mauritius, Madagascar, Comoros and Seychelles to prevent and control Covid-19 and dengue fever.The Indian Navy’s INS Kesari, a 5,600-tonne landing ship, was deployed in response to requests for assistance from the Indian Ocean countries in dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic, the external affairs ministry said on Sunday. The warship is carrying consignments of Covid-19-related essential medicines and food supplies.The two medical assistance teams on board the warship will be deployed in Mauritius and Comoros to help their governments deal with the Covid-19 crisis and dengue fever (in Comoros).The vessel will also deliver consignments of Covid-19-related medicines to Mauritius, Madagascar, Comoros and Seychelles and 600 tonnes of food supplies to the Maldives. It is also carrying a special consignment of Ayurvedic medicines for Mauritius, the ministry said.The consignments for Madagascar and Comoros include hydroxychloroquine tablets. India supplied 50,000 hydroxychloroquine tablets to the Maldives last month and more supplies were also sent to Mauritius and Seychelles.India had also deployed a team of select medical personnel to the Maldives to augment the preparedness of authorities there to fight Covid-19. The Indian Ocean archipelago had so far reported 766 Covid-19 cases and three deaths.The Indian Navy has also played a key role in the repatriation of some 1,000 Indian nationals from the Maldives since last week. The navy deployed two massive warships to Male to bring back the Indians.The operation to help the Indian Ocean countries, named Mission Sagar, was inspired by the prime minister’s vision of “Sagar” – Security and Growth for All in the Region. It is also in line with India’s “time-tested role as the first responder in the region”, the external affairs ministry said.India has already supported the efforts of the governments of the Maldives, Sri Lanka, Mauritius and Seychelles to control and prevent Covid-19 by providing them consignments of essential medicines.Last month, India activated a currency swap arrangement with the Maldives and said it would provide $150 million to help the country mitigate the economic impact of the pandemic. The facility is part of the $400 million currency swap agreement signed in July 2019 between the two countries.India has also deployed a medical rapid response team to Kuwait and provided hydroxychloroquine tablets to many countries in the neighbourhood as grants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-sends-warship-with-medical-teams-to-indian-ocean-nations/story-CYPvMNfsqinowFUWIruOzN.html

The factory owners have given them salary till April and now they are on their own. They have made up their mind to return home. All efforts are being made to send them, he added.The protesters dispersed after the assurance by the district collector.A district administration official on anonymity said the factory owners have conveyed the government that they have provided salary till April and are not in position to provide further and that the government should look for other ways such as using funds of employee state insurance to pay the workers.He said in rural areas the factories are working but they are shut in urban areas due to curfew. The protest happened a day after Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot appealed to migrant workers not to continue to walk and cycle back to their homes. In his appeal, Gehlot had said that the government was making appropriate arrangements to transport the workers to their respective places through buses and trains.He also directed the officials to make arrangements of food and shelter for the workers who have already left on foot, and ensure that no worker stays hungry and thirsty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/desperate-migrant-workers-protest-in-bhilwara-demand-passage-to-home/story-6dgJ91VYXMMpwF0DbE6NJI.html

10-05-2020||India||Army confirms India-China face-off, minor injuries to both sides||The army on Sunday confirmed that a heated confrontation took place between Indian and Chinese soldiers in north Sikkim on Saturday, resulting in injuries to troops on both sides.The army statement came on a day Hindustan Times reported that scores of Indian and Chinese soldiers were involved in a tense face-off at Naku La in Sikkim and the scuffle left 11 soldiers injured.“Incident of face-off as referred to in the (HT) article did take place. Aggressive behaviour by the two sides resulted in minor injuries to troops,” the statement said.The army said “temporary and short duration face-offs” between border guarding troops do occur as boundaries are not resolved. The statement said two sides disengaged after dialogue and interaction at local level. “Troops resolve such issues mutually as per established protocols,” the statement added.Four Indian and seven Chinese soldiers were injured during the confrontation that involved around 150 soldiers.The Asian giants have a long-standing border dispute that led to a war in 1962. The festering feud causes around 400 face-offs every year along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).The face-off at Naku La was not the first time Indian and Chinese soldiers got into a fistfight. In August 2017, Indian and Chinese soldiers threw stones at each other and also exchanged blows near Pangong Lake in Ladakh.The clash near the LAC aggravated bilateral tensions as it happened at a time when the two neighbours were locked in a long standoff in the disputed Doklam plateau close to Sikkim.The 73-day Doklam standoff between India and China along the Sikkim border was likely to be the new normal, the Centre for Joint Warfare Studies (CENJOWS) said in 2017, making a strong case for building military capabilities “as China respected strength.”In a paper titled Looking Beyond Doklam, the CENJOWS, a think tank set up by the defence ministry, said it was crucial for India to demonstrate strength as peace along the disputed border will be “constantly and continuously” under stress with “increase in frequency, intensity and depth of (Chinese) transgressions leading to more and more standoffs.”On Doklam, China had accused India of trespass and preventing its troops from building a road in the remote Himalayan plateau that is claimed by both China and Bhutan. The standoff ended with withdrawal of troops by both armies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-confirms-india-china-face-off-minor-injuries-to-both-sides/story-8VJk43aU1O7Vw0jWtV9ARP.html
10-05-2020||India||Earthquake of 3.4 magnitude reported in Delhi||An earthquake of 3.4 magnitude occurred on Sunday afternoon around 1.45pm near Sonia Vihar, almost the same location as a previous earthquake of 3.5 magnitude on April 12.According to officials at the National Center for Seismology helpline, people called and reported tremors from near the epicentre in Sonia Vihar.The location coordinates of the event is latitude 28.7 N and longitude 77.2 E, depth 5km. Seismologists said it’s too early to say why there is another earthquake with the same epicentre in just over a amonth.“There are many faults in and around Delhi. There is the Sohna fault, and Mathura and Mahendergarh faults, which can contribute to earthquakes. There are several lineaments (an expression of an underlying geological structure such as a fracture) also. One lineament could have activated other lineaments. But we need to refine our recordings and findings to see what happened,” said AP Pandey, a seismologist at NCS.The location coordinates, according to NCS for the previous earthquake was also latitude 28.7 north and longitude 77.2 east, depth 6.5km. It’s not unusual for epicentre of these relatively small earthquakes to be in Delhi and neighbouring Haryana, seismologists had said. But in April, the experience was much more intense for people in Delhi because of less noise associated with traffic movement owing to the ongoing lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/earthquake-of-3-4-magnitude-reported-in-delhi/story-8fiGIDlwokBYcEjsCLLSLI.html

As we pay tribute to the greatest spy that India ever had, here is a look at his life.Kao founded India’s external intelligence agency, the Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW) in the 1960s.He and his officers under him played a vital role in merger of Sikkim in India.Ramji Kao straddled the world of secret intelligence during India’s formative years as a nation. He was deputed to the Intelligence Bureau (IB) in 1947 and trained under the watchful eyes of the legendary Bhola Nath Mullick.He handled some of the legendary cases, like the ‘Kashmir Princess’ probe in the mid-1950s and contributed to the liberation of Bangladesh in 1971.He was a close adviser and security chief to three Indian Prime Ministers, and was one of the founding fathers of the Directorate General of Security (DGS) after India’s conflict with China in 1962.He later went on to head the Aviation Research Centre (ARC) and R&AW. Kao was the first chief of the ARC.But being a spymaster was not the only quality that Kao possessed. He was also a sculptor, according to a book. He also mentored two generations of R&AW spies. The team was called ‘Kao-boys’.A lesser known fact about Kao is that he had recorded his past events in a tape recorder and wanted them released to the public after his death.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/remembering-rn-kao-india-s-legendary-spymaster/story-nVDUr6OaQpdMIR6iFRcWoM.html
10-05-2020||India||NDMA issues guidelines for restarting manufacturing units||The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has issued detailed guidelines for manufacturing industries on measures they have to take when they restart units, days after the gas leak at a plant in Andhra Pradesh’s Visakhapatnam that killed 12 people.The authority has said industries to consider the first week of restarting any machinery or chemical unit as the “trial or test” period and “not try to achieve high production targets”.“Due to several weeks of lockdown and the closure of industrial units during the lockdown period, it is possible that some of the operators might not have followed the established SOP (standard operating procedure). As a result, some of the manufacturing facilities, pipelines, valves, etc. may have residual chemicals, which may pose risk. The same is true for the storage facilities with hazardous chemicals and flammable materials,” NDMA said on Saturday.“When Lockout/Tagout procedures are not in place, many energy sources can prove to be hazardous to operators/supervisors who are servicing or maintaining electrical, mechanical or chemical equipment. When heavy machinery and equipment are not maintained periodically, they can become dangerous for the operators/engineers,” it added.“Combustible liquids, contained gaseous substances, open wires, conveyor belts and automated vehicles make manufacturing facilities a high-risk environment. Improper enforcement of safety codes and improperly labelled chemicals can further pose serious health hazards.”To minimise the risk at any unit, the guidelines said, employees who work on specific should be sensitised and made aware of the need to identify abnormalities like strange sounds or smell, exposed wires, vibrations, leaks, smoke, abnormal wobbling, irregular grinding or other potentially hazardous signs which indicate the need for an immediate maintenance or if required shutdown.The factories or units have to also ensure that all lockout and tagouts, the specific practices and procedures to ensure the safety employees from the unexpected startup of machinery and equipment, are in place on a daily basis and inspection of all equipment as per the safety protocols carried out during the restart phase.The guidelines ask the industry to take the help of local administration in case it has any difficulty in managing crucial backward linkages that may be critical for their safe functioning. District magistrates have been asked to ensure that, in such instances, the industrial unit may be facilitated to run their end to end operations, in the overall interests of industrial security.NDMA has also detailed the steps that specific industry needs to take when they reopen. For example, storage or raw material units have been asked to inspect any signs of spills, wear and tear during the lockdown. They have also been asked to check for already opened storage vessels, containers, bags or silos for possible oxidation, chemical reaction, rusting or rotting etc as well as check supply pipelines, valves or conveyor belts for any signs of damage or wear and tear.The manufacturing units have been told to carry out a complete safety audit of the entire unit before taking up starting activities and they should first clean the pipelines, equipment and discharge lines.Factories working 24 hours have been asked to consider one hour gap between shifts, except factories/plants requiring continuous operations.They have also been asked to operate with 33% managerial and administrative staff as per the Union ministry of home affairs’ (MHA’s) guidelines but while deciding which particular person to be included at any given point of time, overriding priority should be given to personnel dealing with safety.Factories are also to prepare accommodation to isolate workers if needed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ndma-issues-guidelines-for-restarting-manufacturing-units/story-YHj2rH84DB8eEfGnvFMZTI.html

The first case in the region was detected in Manipur on March 24 and it took 24 days for the figure to reach 50 and another 18 days to cross 100 on May 4.Till Sunday morning, the seven states in the region had 212 cases. Tripura leads the tally with 132 cases, followed by Assam with 63, including one patient from Nagaland who was tested and treated in Guwahati, and Meghalaya with 13.Manipur had two cases and one each in Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh—all patients in these three states have recovered and have been discharged. No fresh cases have been reported there in over a month. Nagaland hasn’t recorded any case till date.There has been a sudden spike in cases in Tripura, which had claimed Covid-19 free status on April 24 after the first two patients had tested negative.But on May 2, two personnel of the Border Security Force’s (BSF’s) 138th battalion in Ambassa were found positive. A day later, 12 more people from the same battalion tested positive.The trend continued in the next few days with more positive cases getting confirmed among BSF personnel and their family members of the force’s 138th and 86th battalion—both stationed in Ambassa of Dhalai district in the state.“17 persons found Covid-19 positive in Tripura today from 86th battalion of BSF, Ambassa. No civilian found positive among them,” Biplab Kumar Deb, Tripura chief minister, tweeted late on Saturday.Alarmed with the spurt in Covid-19 cases without any known source of infection, the Tripura government has asked BSF authorities to conduct an inquiry. The state has also requested Delhi-based National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) to send a team to the state to probe the cases and arrest spread of the respiratory disease.Assam has also witnessed a rise in cases following the opening of the state’s borders for residents returning back from other parts of the country after the Union home ministry allowed inter-state movement.Two women from Jorhat, who returned from Mumbai in an ambulance, as well as the driver of the vehicle, were found to have been infected with Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, on Saturday, taking the state’s tally to 63 cases.Assam health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said the two women were bringing back a cancer patient. Questions have been raised on why the ambulance driver was allowed to leave the state.“The driver left for Mumbai and we allowed him to go as he was asymptomatic. Now on our request he has been stopped in Bihar for hospitalization (sic),” Sarma tweeted on Sunday morning.Till Sunday morning, Assam had recorded 34 recoveries and two deaths. Twenty-seven Covid-19 patients are still recovering in various hospitals.After a gap of 19 days, Meghalaya recorded another positive case on Saturday taking the state’s tally to 13 cases. While one patient has died, 10 others have recovered and two are under treatment. All cases in the state have links with the first patient, a doctor from Shillong, who died on April 15.“Unfortunately we have another positive case in Shillong. It’s a person working in the same house (the first patient’s house),” Conrad Sangma, Meghalaya’s chief minister, tweeted on Saturday.“As a precaution, health department was retesting all the primary contacts (of the first patient) and in the process we found this positive case. The person is safe and healthy and showing no symptoms (sic),” he added.(With inputs from Priyanka Deb Barman in Agartala)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-cases-in-north-east-double-from-100-to-past-200-in-just-4-days/story-iQliVrMGLlVgISGdG3LjaL.html

He had come as a tourist in a group of 23 persons and stayed at a hotel.Also read: 14 states see dip in number of active Covid-19 cases, shows data“The contact history of the first positive person was of 59 persons and they were sent for an examination to SMS Medical College, Jaipur. To rule out any possibility, the survey of whole Mandawa municipal area was conducted by 45 teams in which 42,28 houses were visited and 24,873 persons were screened. Total 52 (influenza-like illness) ILI cases were found who were later examined by medical officers. None of them was found suitable for sampling. The first episode got closed there,” said Umar Deen Khan, district collector, Jhunjhunu.On March 14, a family, which had recently come from Italy, developed the symptoms with high-grade fever, cough. The members of the family visited the district hospital for examination but didn’t get any relief. After three days, they again visited the hospital and doctors took their samples for Covid-19. On March 18, all three of them were found positive.“The cases created a great panic in Jhunjhunu as well as in the state. Immediately, the additional chief secretary, medical and health department, Rohit Kumar Singh sent a team of senior officers from the directorate to handle the situation. The next day, Dr Pratap Singh Dootar, additional director, was given the charge of chief medical & health officer who had worked in Jhunjhunu for a long time on the same post. He took over the charge and worked on the future strategy with district administration to control the virus,” added Khan.In order to control the spread, a strategic committee was formed which consisted of the collector, Dr Pratap Singh Dootar; Jhunjhunu superintendent of police JP Sharma; Ramniwas Jat, CEO and Rajendra Agrawal, Additional District Magistrate, Jhunjhunu.The team worked under the guidance of additional chief secretary, health, Rohit Kumar Singh; Jaipur range inspector general S Sengathir and transport department secretary Ravi Jain.The Jhunjhunu district magistrate said 1,500 teams were formed to tackle the coronavirus challenge. The teams carried out intense screening of the entire district for early detection of cases. A door-to-door survey of the whole district was conducted. The teams visited 40,2670 houses visited and screened 23,98,146 people. A total of 5,444 samples were taken out which 5,282 came out negative and the results of 120 samples are awaited.“The key areas identified to contain the virus were people with a history of a visit to China Italy, Spain, Iran and other foreign countries, people who came from other states, those who participated in the Tablighi Jamat congregation in Nizamuddin, Delhi and people who had come from other districts. Information about all high-risk people was collected through various sources,” said KhanFor quarantine and isolation of the suspects, the district administration identified 19 places with a capacity of 3800 people. On the basis of the inputs of the teams that conducted on-ground surveys, further strategy was formed.“In Mandawa, Nawalgarh and Gudha, the transmission of the virus took place through contact spread. For example, in Mandawa, three people got positive who had come in contact with the first positive case. In Gudha, 12 persons tested positive who had come in contact with another positive case. But, due to aggressive sampling and by shifting the people who had came in contact with the positive cases the chains of infection was broken and no secondary transmission took place,” Khan stated.The DM said that Jhunjhunu is among the top five districts in terms of total samples test and the rate of positive cases is only 0.75%. “Another good indicator is that Covid-19 has not spread in any group of service providers - administration, police and medical staff. However, we are still on our toes and not taking the situation lightly,” said Khan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/once-the-gateway-of-covid-19-rajasthan-s-jhunjhunu-has-no-positive-case-since-april-25/story-L5qtyXVgobZgm5u86ziyMK.html

In medical parlance it is called hypoxia,” the hospital’s medical director Dr Sunil Khemka said in a bulletin.“As of now, Jogi’s neurological activity is almost nil. In simple words, we can say he has slipped into coma. He is on ventilator. We are making all efforts to improve his health, but the situation is worrisome at present,” he said.In the next 48 hours, it will be assessed how Jogi’s body is responding to medicines, the official said, adding that the leader is being treated by a team of eight specialist doctors.A bureaucrat-turned-politician, Jogi, currently an MLA from Marwahi seat, served as the first chief minister of Chhattisgarh from November 2000 to November 2003 in the then Congress government, after the formation of the state.He parted ways with the Congress in 2016 after he and his Amit Jogi got embroiled in a controversy over the alleged fixing of bypoll to Antagarh seat in Kanker district in 2014.He subsequently formed his own outfit JCC (J).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-chhattisgarh-cm-ajit-jogi-slips-into-coma-on-ventilator-support-doctor/story-iYtCoVEG0AjRbZMyRkU4qN.html

These are Manipur, Sikkim, Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh and Mizoram.Mizoram’s Covid-19-free status can be attributed to the discipline of its people, Chief Minister Pu Zoramthanga said on Sunday.“Mizoram is a very disciplined state. With the help of the church, NGOs and administration, we have so far survived this crisis and are determined to continue to do so in the future,” he told news agency PTI.He, however, said acknowledged the threat from “corona carriers” looms large over the state, which shares a 510-kilometre border with Myanmar and a 318-kilometre border with Bangladesh.“This is a great threat for us as there are high chances of people from Myanmar and Bangladesh infiltrating into Mizoram due to the open borders. We are taking all measures to stop it.” he said.While Bangladesh has reported 13,134 cases of coronavirus with 206 deaths, Myanmar has 177 cases.Union minister Jitendra Singh had said on Saturday that the entire northeastern region has emerged as the model of coronavirus management and the rest of the country should emulate it.He said that people in the northeast of India - Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Manipur, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Tripura and Assam - have been following the lockdown-related guidelines in letter and spirit.“By tradition and by lifestyle, people of northeastern region are civilised and disciplined. That is why they could very easily follow the lockdown guidelines. There has been no problem in ensuring implementation of the lockdown-related guidelines there,” Singh said.Five out of eight northeastern states are free from the deadly virus now and Sikkim never had a single case throughout.The number of Covid-19 cases in India, meanwhile, reached 62,939 on Sunday, according to the Union Health Ministry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5-states-in-north-east-free-from-covid-19-govt-hails-discipline-of-people/story-zJuUIpJZAw3YP6t0aNDFzM.html

The state has recorded 527 new cases and 38 deaths in the past seven days.Thirteen of West Bengal’s 23 districts have reported new cases of Covid-19 in the last week, and the worst affected city is Kolkata. It is mainly because of the sharp increase in the numbers in Kolkata that Bengal’s overall graph is also rising.Overall, 911 persons tested positive in Kolkata and 116 of them died, with 64 deaths attributed to Covid-19 and 52 to co-morbidity.The situation is most critical in boroughs number 1 to 9 sprawling across north and central Kolkata and parts of south Kolkata, and borough no 15 in western Kolkata, covering mostly the Garden Reach area. Of the total 326 containment zones in the city, 255 are between wards no 1 and 90 of the total 144-ward Kolkata Municipal Corporation.The Centre had recently rapped the state government over its Covid-19 management which, it said, was characterised by a very low rate of testing in proportion to the population, and the highest mortality rate in the country - of 13.2 per cent.The state government, however, said less number of active cases was detected in the initial days due to lack of infrastructure, and this resulted in an apparently high rate of deaths in the state.As for the return of migrant labourers and pilgrims stuck in other states, the Home Secretary said that the state government is taking necessary steps.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-country-s-highest-covid-19-mortality-rate-west-bengal-a-concern-for-centre/story-JM8vn2KIiHStKjtFbOZtFJ.html

10-05-2020||India||Chhattisgarh demands additional levy amount of Rs 4140.21 cr on coal from Centre||Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel has written a letter to Union Minister of Coal and Mines Pralhad Joshi again requesting for the state’s rightful share of additional levy collected from coal block allottees of the state.The chief minister said that the additional levy of Rs 4,140.21 crore being deposited to the coal ministry by the eight companies, which have been allotted coal blocks in the state, should be made available to the state government immediately for effective implementation of coronavirus lockdown measures.Referring to his letter sent on January 23, Baghel said that the state government had earlier demanded the additional levy of more than Rs 4,140.21 crore deposited to the Centre by eight former coal blocks allottees out of the total cancelled blocks at the rate of Rs 295 per metric ton for mining. But, the state is yet to receive the information about the action taken by the Union Coal Ministry in this regard.Baghel also referred to the State Government’s opinion given in reply to the Union Coal Ministry’s letter dated 27 August 2015. He also mentioned the order issued by the Supreme Court in this regard, stating that the additional and prescribed amount of levy should eventually be payable to the state government.Baghel, in his letter, contends that as per Constitution, the Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Act, the rules of the Mines and Minerals Act 1951, Mineral Concession Rules 2016 and the Chhattisgarh Land Revenue Code, the state government has the ownership to collect royalty, levy and other taxes on minerals. He added that there is also a provision in favour of the state government. The chief minister emphasized that the state government has the entitlement to receive the amount of additional levy deposited to the Coal Ministry, at the rate of Rs. 295 per metric ton by the former coal block allottees.Baghel said that Chhattisgarh is also under lockdown for the last one and a half months to prevent the spread of Covid-19. Several protective measures have been implemented in the state for the prevention of the infection. As a result, only 59 corona positive cases have been found in the state so far. 43 people in the state have recovered from coronavirus and 16 are currently under treatment.The state government has taken immediate steps to prevent coronavirus infection. It has also taken measures to prevent migration of labourers of the state, provide health and food grains to the labourers living in the state and look into the arrangement of the movement of people from other states as per the guidelines issued by the Government of India.The chief minister said that providing the state’s rightful share of the additional levy amount will help the state government work more strongly and effectively in the public interest of the state during the situation arising from Covid-19 pandemic.Baghel has requested the Union Coal Minister to take action to provide the additional levy amount of about Rs 4140.21 crore as soon as possible in the state interest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-demands-additional-levy-amount-of-rs-4140-21-crore-on-coal-from-centre/story-P91klOmCLQawALaEjgrdlM.html
10-05-2020||India||At NSA Ajit Doval’s mega Kashmir meet, a stinker for Pak and a piece of advice||At his five-hour long meeting to review the operational strategies and tactics of security forces in Jammu and Kashmir, National Security Adviser Ajit Doval showered praises on security forces for the successful elimination of Kashmir’s Hizbul Mujahideen chief Riyaz Naikoo over the week. In that praise, Doval also slipped in a message: the importance of developing actionable human intelligence and operational synergy among forces fronting the counter-terror operations.The Special Operations Group of the Jammu and Kashmir Police had been working on people in the Kupwara district who had had access to Riyaz Naikoo. As J&K police chief Dilbag Singh told this newspaper later, one of them was a man who had played a role in building the secret bunker in his native village in south Kashmir’s Pulwama. The intelligence was pinpointed. The security forces didn’t give up when they couldn’t locate him in the first round and kept up the search.Riyaz Naikoo’s elimination, a serious setback to terror group Hizbul Mujahideen in south Kashmir, is considered one of the most successful security operations in recent months in Jammu and Kashmir.In a video of Naikoo’s boss mourning his death, the Hizbul founder who also leads the Pakistan’s ISI-backed alliance of terror groups United Jihad Council, Syed Salahuddin said the mujahideen (terrorists) had broken the back of the enemy (India) in Handwara Rajwar recently “but the enemy (India) has the edge”.PAK PRIMED FOR TERRORPakistan deep state is in control of PM Imran Khan’s Kashmir policyIslamabad has primed its terror factories for big action in India this summerImran Khan’s remark accusing India of looking for a ‘false flag’ sets the basePak PM’s statement is preemptive denial, implies will not pull in the reins on terror Attempts by terrorists to infiltrate from Pakistan to increase over next few weeksNew terror outfits such as TRF to claim responsibility for attacks to give Pak an alibiAjit Doval told security forces to aim higher, spot every terrorists infiltrating from PakAnalyse infiltration routes to spot gaps in counter-infiltration grid along LoCFocus on human intelligence, it led to spectacular op that eliminated Riyaz NaikooStep up offensive against foreign terrorists in Kashmir valleySecurity forces should improve synergy for pinpointed action; display mutual respectAjit Doval’s meeting with top army commanders and chiefs of all intelligence and paramilitary forces deployed in Jammu and Kashmir was convened to sharpen this edge.Pak’s deep state is inchargePakistan, by all accounts, is determined to bear down on India. This is the first summer after India scrapped Jammu and Kashmir’s special status in August last year and Islamabad has been prepping ever since.It had floated The Resistance Front late last year, a name stripped of the religious label designed to message to the world that they are India-bred. Lashkar-e-Taiba, the terror group notorious for brutal killings in Kashmir, had been tasked to handhold this newly-minted terror group and let them take the credit for all terrorist action to ward-off international pressure.Doval’s meeting felt that it was clear that the deep state was clearly incharge of Pakistan’s Kashmir policy. And Imran Khan, quite like India had anticipated right in the beginning, was letting the army run the show.Also Read: Pak launches terror’s new face in Kashmir, Imran Khan follows up on TwitterImran Khan’s recent tweet on Kashmir that attributed violence in Kashmir to an “indigenous resistance movement” and accused India of finding a pretext to launch a “false flag operation” also found a reference at the meeting.This remark has been interpreted in New Delhi to imply that the TRF model of funding terror and denying a role in terrorism in Kashmir was the template. As long as it works.What it means for KashmirA senior government official who was present at Doval’s marathon meeting - he let the officers do most of the talking - told Hindustan Times that Pakistan’s determination to have a stab at pushing terror this year coincided with his simultaneous effort to try to internationalise developments in Kashmir. The decision to place the Pakistan Air Force on alert this week pointed in this direction.For security forces in Kashmir, this implied that they would have to scale up the counter-infiltration grid along the Line of Control and the counter-insurgency grid in the Kashmir valley. Doval told security forces deployed along the line of control to ensure that terrorists from Pakistan don’t slip past them, day or night. Last month, about 25-30 of them did.There will be more attempts this month.Intelligence agencies have had to update their estimate of about 230 terrorists at the terror launch pads in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir within just about three weeks when their number shot up to 450.The biggest contingent is aligned to the Lashkar-e-Taiba (244) and the Jaish-e-Mohammed (129), which plans to carryy out simultaneous attacks on 11 May. The Hizbul Mujahideen, which has a depleted strength in South Kashmir, had about 60.The army and Border Security Force shared their plans how they intended to minimise the possibility of terrorists slipping in, plans that officials said did require some tweaks.And a word of adviceNSA Ajit Doval underscored that the blueprint put on the table at the meeting would require absolute synergy between different security forces. There cannot be a mismatch, he told them. The advice was given in context of reports that he had received about lack of coordination between ground commanders from different forces.Some of this lack of mutual respect is reflected in the controversy around “unpleasant” comments made about the Central Reserve Police Force by Jammu and Kashmir Inspector General of Police (Kashmir) Vijay Kumar.Kumar, according to a leaked report filed by a CRPF officer to his seniors, said at a meeting that the CRPF wasn’t contributing enough to the counter-terror effort but only taking credit when it was the army and the J&K police that did most of the work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-big-kashmir-meet-to-blunt-pak-s-terror-offensive-ajit-doval-also-has-some-advice/story-mCJyQAHHOgGBWXQy6YzcOM.html

There was no instance of poaching the 430 sq km park since April 1, 2019, and it had recorded three poaching deaths last year. “The carcass of the adult male rhino was found by our personnel on Saturday evening at the Agaratoli range of the park with its horn missing. It seems the poaching incident took place on Wednesday,” P Sivakumar, director of the national park, said.All the five national parks, 18 wildlife sanctuaries and zoos in Assam have been closed for tourists since mid-March due to the nationwide lockdown to prevent the spread of Covid-19. But there have been instances of movement of poachers during this period.“There was some information about the movement of eight persons allegedly belonging to some extremist group from Karbi Anglong in the Panbari area with three AK series rifles. Combing operations were carried out based on the information,” Sivakumar said.“This is the first case of use of AK-47 rifles to kill rhino in the Agaratoli range of the park. Only trained groups who know how to handle such arms can indulge in such kind of poaching. We suspect they had come from the nearby Karbi Anglong district,” he added.Last month, villagers on the eastern side of the park had caught a suspected rhino poacher with arms and handed him over to the police and forest officials.“Kaziranga did its best to keep poachers away in last 13 months. Unfortunately it was the poachers’ day (sic),” Rohit Choudhury, a wildlife activist, tweeted.With a population of around 2,400, Kaziranga is the largest habitat of the one-horned rhino in the world. It is also a hunting ground for poachers who target the animal for its horn—prized as medicine in China and some other Southeast Asian countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-lull-of-13-months-poachers-kill-rhino-in-assam-s-kaziranga-steal-horn/story-tSSd76BkCoDGapuRNVucmK.html

Four of us including my nephew and myself could survive as we were asleep a little away from the railway tracks,” said Sajjan Singh Dhruve, a resident of Mandla in Madhya Pradesh.Dhruve and his nephew Indal Singh sustained minor injuries in the mishap. They and two other labourers were part of a group of 20 labourers which left Jalna in Maharashtra for Shahdol, Umaria and Mandla districts in Madhya Pradesh.“We had some money with us but not any conveyance to reach home. Due to lockdown and no work we were running short of money. Lockdown is getting extended time and again. Our concern was if we would remain stranded till rainy season begins we would not be able to even walk home. Hence, we wanted to reach home early while walking,” he added.Shahdol is 858 kilometres, Umaria 862 kilometres and Mandla is 667 kilometres from Jalna.“All the labourers in the iron rod factory at Jalna where we worked requested the management to make an arrangement for our travel to reach home. The authorities of the factory sent an e-mail too to the administration in this regard but there was no response. I had talks with my village sarpanch at least thrice. He assured me that he would do something but there was no result,” said Dhruve.The bodies of the 16 labourers killed in the mishap near Aurangabad division reached Jabalpur in a ‘Shramik Special’ train.“Our apprehension was that there might not be any relief from the lockdown for a long time. Then we decided to walk and reach home anyhow. Had the factory management or the government made arrangements for our travel the tragedy would have not struck us,” said Dhruve.“It was on Thursday evening when we started walking. We later got along the railway tracks and had walked for about 40 kilometres up to Karmad when we got tired and hungry. It was about 4 in the morning. We all had food on the tracks itself. While 16 of the group later got into sleep on the tracks itself, four of us including my nephew and myself slept a little away from the railway tracks,” he added.He said that the labourers slept wherever they could find place. “There was nothing in our mind as to who would sleep on the railway tracks and who would not. We wanted to take rest for a while and then walk again on way to Aurangabad. We were fast asleep. Four of us sleeping some distance away from the railway tracks woke up as we got hit by stones. We saw a goods train standing on the track where 16 of us were sleeping. We couldn’t understand for a while as to what had happened. When the train started running then we realised about the tragedy,” said Dhruve.Dhruve lost consciousness after seeing the bodies of his fellow labourers and was taken to a hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lockdown-getting-extended-didn-t-want-to-remain-stranded-aurangabad-train-tragedy-survivor/story-B6hppmqOlwpas9Y2Dx86eK.html

As a result, some of the manufacturing facilities, pipelines, valves, etc. may have residual chemicals, which may pose risk,” the NDMA said in a letter to states.“While restarting the unit, consider the first week as the trial or test run period; ensure all safety protocols; and not try to achieve high production targets,” it added.The order also said that state governments should be prepared to implement a disaster management plan for major accidental hazard units.“To minimise the risk, it is important that employees who work on specific equipment are sensitised and made aware of the need to identify abnormalities like strange sounds or smell, exposed wires, vibrations, leaks, smoke, abnormal wobbling, irregular grinding or other potentially hazardous signs which indicate the need for an immediate maintenance or if required shutdown,” the NDMA said.It also said that factories should ensure 24-hour sanitisation, especially in the common areas that include lunch rooms and common tables which will have to be wiped clean with disinfectants after every single use.For accommodation, sanitisation needs to be performed regularly to ensure worker safety and reduce spread of contamination, the guideline further said.The order has been sent to all the state chief secretaries after gas leak at LG Polymers plant in Andhra Pradesh’s Visakhapatnam in which 11 people were killed.The gas leak happened before dawn, affecting villages near the factory. About 1,000 people were admitted to the hospitals with breathing difficulties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-vizag-gas-leak-centre-issues-guidelines-for-restarting-industries-post-coronavirus-lockdown/story-H7cL5POQ1UQss7UeXxrgTO.html

This is safer and acceptable,” said Alapan Bandyopadhay, state home secretary.Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla, in his letter to West Bengal chief secretary Rajiva Sinha, had stated on Wednesday that goods traffic through border crossings between India and Bangladesh, falling in the state, didn’t resume.Bhalla told that by doing so, West Bengal was not only violating the Ministry of Home Affairs’ orders under Disaster Management Act but also Articles 253, 256 and 257 of the Constitution of India.To this, Bandyopadhay had earlier stated that there were some local problems which had cropped up at Petrapole in North 24 Parganas.“In case of Petrapole there has been some public issue. People at the border are in emotive commotion. The whole thing is being navigated. We will address the issue in due time after careful consideration of all the aspects involved. There are several issues concerning trade between India and Bangladesh. They would be considered after detailed discussion,” Bandopadhyay had said on Wednesday soon after the centre’s letter.Bangladesh is India’s biggest trade partner in South Asia. India’s export to Bangladesh for the financial year 2018-19 was $9.21 billion and imports from Bangladesh for the same period was $1.22 billion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-suggests-rail-route-for-trade-with-bangladesh-after-rap-from-centre/story-rhazuYvyVERp0U0q9fqq8L.html

Using the application, people can report forest fires through geo-tagged images.The application also enables people to track the location of fire fighting vehicles and crew on a real-time basis.“Our main aim with this application is to reduce the response time. We have mapped our fire crew stations, plantations, van panchayats along with type of forests. As soon as a new fire is detected by Forest Survey of India, we can put the input received from FSI on our system and know the exact location of the fire, whether it is in a pine forest or a plantation or civil forest,” said Vaibhav Singh, divisional forest officer of Rudraprayag division.He said that officials will be able to inform a crew station and concerned person about the fire incident using the application.“By the time we send the secondary team, someone will already be there to deal with the situation. Anyone using the application will be able to find out how far the fire is from their current location and plan to use resources accordingly. The same will be monitored from the master control room,” said Singh.The mobile application also has information on fire awareness along with a provision for people to volunteer and help the forest department in controlling fires.The application has features like mapping of all fire crew stations so as to ascertain the first respondent, elaborate list of actions based on colour code circulated to the public, mapping of forest types along with density in master control room to determine the threat and ease of spreading of fire. It also has details of a person in-charge for plantations, nurseries, van panchayats to help in the fight against forest fire.This week, to spread awareness amongst locals about preventing forest fires, Rudraprayag division had also put up posters using famous dialogues from films like Sholay, Dabang, Dirty Picture and so on.Around 1,500 such posters were made, and 200 of them being put up in every forest range. The posters also give information on punishment for setting forests on fire, that is, a fine of Rs 5,000 and imprisonment up to two years. It also has the fire control room numbers mentioned so that people can call and alert the department about any fire incident.So far, no case of forest fire has been reported from the Rudraprayag division this year, but total 18 incidents of forest fire have been reported from Uttarakhand with a loss of 11.03 hectares of forest area.In Uttarakhand, 0.17% of total forest cover is extremely fire prone, 1.60% comes under very highly fire prone, 9.32% under highly fire prone, 21.66% under moderately fire prone and 67.25% under less fire prone category. Since the formation of the state in the year 2000, over 44,554 hectares of the forest area has been damaged in forest fires accruing a loss of over Rs 185 lakh, revealed an RTI reply by the Uttarakhand government last year.Uttarakhand forest department has around 174 watchtowers and 1,437 station crews across the state to keep a tab on the forest fires and take measures to check them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-s-rudraprayag-forest-division-launches-app-to-monitor-forest-fires/story-rnX8sQLWuxs7076IJVSoHN.html

Her 60-year-old father was the first in the family to get tested positive for the coronavirus disease after showing symptoms like persistent cough and high temperature.After he tested positive, the health authorities took the woman’s nasal swabs as well as her family members’ and of tenants in their house. On April 4, she was told that seven people in their household, including her 51-year-old mother, have tested positive for Covid-19. The other persons who tested positive were her 55-year-old uncle, 50-year-old aunt, and three other women in the tenant’s family.“When I was taken to the hospital in an ambulance it was surprising for me as I never felt anything. There was no cold or cough or any discomfort. I have hardly been sick in my life. So this was a strange experience,” said the woman.But more than her testing positive, she was worried over her 60-year-old father being in AIIMS Bhubaneswar all alone. “He had multiple complications including asthma, high blood pressure and diabetes. From whatever I had read, these complications were awful for anyone getting infected with Covid-19. He is mentally challenged and that worried me and my family about his capacity to cope up with the virus,” she said.First christened as Case No 5 in government records, the state government officials later made his name public. Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation commissioner PC Chaudhury, who revealed the name of 60-year-old patient said it was being done to find out if any outsiders came in contact with him apart from his family. The move, however, came in for a flak with several people slamming the government for being selective. The man, among the handful critical Covid-19 patients of Odisha was finally discharged on May 7 even though he had tested negative for the disease on April 8. However, he was under treatment for other ailments like diabetes and asthma and was discharged from the hospital on Friday after recovering from his illness.At the hospital, the woman’s mother, aunt and uncle were the first one to recover as their swab samples tested negative within a week of admission. But her swab samples taken twice in four days after her admission tested positive again.“I knew it would take some time before I can test negative for the virus. I had stopped checking WhatsApp messages worried over friends asking me about my health. I stuck to a schedule of yoga and pranayam in the morning followed by breakfast and then some reading about miracles of Saibaba. I used to listen to songs of Lord Jagannath. In the hospital, we were asked to gurgle with hot water 5 times a day and drink at least 5-6 litres of water. The nurses used to come to take body temperature twice a day and doctor once everyday,” she said. She tested negative twice in the end of April.Since she returned home, the woman has been in self-quarantine. She put her WhatsApp status as ‘I am not lucky, I am blessed’. “My friends have been supportive, but some neighbours think me and my family members still carry the virus. When my family members went out after completing the quarantine, some neighbours complained how we can be allowed out. It was a little unsettling,” she said. Now raring to join her workplace after the lockdown is over, the woman said there people should not be scared of the disease. “I implore all people to have faith in the doctors and the nursing staff, who are doing a commendable job in containing the disease. If my father who had several complications could be cured, others too. No one should hide in their homes to avoid being hospitalised.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/recovered-from-covid-19-odisha-woman-has-a-message/story-LzV06ZKh1GEWz8gXWBU50I.html
10-05-2020||India||‘Mamata is scared’: BJP’s social media campaign after no press meet by Bengal CM in 9 days||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Saturday launched a social media campaign taking a swipe at West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee for staying away from the media for more than a week. The campaign is being called Bhoy Peyechhe Mamata, which means Mamata is scared in Bengali.Top state and national leaders of the BJP began tweeting and posting on Facebook, using the hashtag #BhoyPeyechheMamata to charge that Banerjee was avoiding the media because of her failures, which they said have been exposed by the Narendra Modi-led Union government.The campaign and the social media posts came on the day that Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress took jibes at Prime Minister Modi for never taking a question at any press conference since taking charge in 2014. West Bengal’s ruling party also accused the BJP of prioritising electoral interests in light of the 2021 assembly elections over saving lives in the current coronavirus pandemic. Since March, Mamata Banerjee has been at the forefront of the state’s battle against Covid-19 and has interacted with the press almost every day. But since April 30, she has not met the media.Instead, the state’s chief secretary and home secretary are briefing reporters on administrative issues, while TMC spokespersons have been actively disseminating political messages. “PPE kit discrepancies, death toll embezzlement, ration corruption from the beginning till now @MamataOfficial’s administration has misled the people. Be patient! People will answer. #BhoyPeyecheMamata (sic),” Shiv Prakash, the BJP’s national joint general secretary (organisation), wrote on Twitter on Saturday. The party’s national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya tweeted, “Doctors crying for PPE, patients lying with dead bodies. Migrant labour not allowed to leave state. Bengalis not allowed to come back home. Hospitals not taking patients. Police attacked @MamataOfficial government is absolute disaster. #BhoyPeyecheMamata (sic)”.“Where are you Mamata Banerjee? Covid 19 cases are increasing, no of tests are still low and not giving permission to bring back Bengali migrant labour’s from other states? #BhoyPeyecheMamata,” Mukul Roy, BJP’s national executive member, tweeted.“People of Bengal are looking for their health minister, who also happens to be the Chief Minister, as number of Covid cases keep rising, doctors continue to protest, testing remains absymally low and reported data is wholly unreliable. Please help! #BhoyPeyecheMamata#SaveBengal (sic),” Amit Malviya, BJP’s IT cell’s national head, also tweeted.On Saturday afternoon, Trinamool Congress had taken digs at PM Modi for avoiding press conferences.“We hold long press conferences and take all questions. Our chief minister always leads from the front at any hour of crisis. But the Prime Minister has not taken a single question from a press conference, ever since taking charge in 2014,” Derek O’Brien, the TMC national spokesperson and Rajya Sabha member, said.O’Brien alleged that while the Bengal government and the state’s ruling party was preoccupied with fighting the coronavirus pandemic, the BJP was focussed on the Bengal Assembly elections due in 2021.“The BJP started its 2021 electoral campaign on the day the inter-ministerial central teams (IMCT) reached Bengal on April 20,” O’Brien said.Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar, the party’s Lok Sabha MP, alleged that “all the moves taken by the Centre regarding the handling of the Covid-19 situation in Bengal were, in reality, political moves. The Centre could not stand the fact that Mamata Banerjee was leading the battle from the front and was doing better than the Centre.” IMCT had accused the state administration of negligence and mismanagement.Meanwhile, following a fortnight-long controversy and since May 3, the West Bengal government has been sharing detailed information including district and state-wise daily number of new Covid-19 cases, active cases, cumulative numbers of persons testing positive and the number of deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamata-is-scared-bjp-s-social-media-campaign-after-no-press-meet-by-bengal-cm-in-9-days/story-6S0YX5KO5xUd9TLzB2irnJ.html
10-05-2020||India||Senior BJD leader Subash Chouhan who had switched over from BJP last year dies||Senior Biju Janata Dal (BJD) leader Subash Chouhan, who had switched from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) just before the Lok Sabha election last year, died at a hospital in Odisha’s Bhubaneswar on Sunday morning days after he was diagnosed with liver cancer.He was 54.Chouhan, who hailed from western Odisha district of Bargarh, was being treated at the Bhubaneswar-based hospital for the last couple of days. A bachelor, he is survived by his parents and brother.The former Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and Bajrang Dal member was made the chairperson of the Western Odisha Development Council, an official body that looks after the development of 10 western districts including Bargarh, Sambalpur, Kalahandi, Bolangir and Nuapada, in September last year.Known for his organisational skills, Chouhan had joined the BJD in March last year after a feud with BJP leader and Union petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan whom he accused of denying him the party ticket for the Bargarh Lok Sabha constituency. In the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, he had narrowly lost the election as a BJP candidate from the Bargarh seat.After he joined the BJD, Subhash Chouhan was appointed as the ruling party’s general secretary and one of its spokespersons. He was made the BJD’s observer for Kalahandi, Bolangir, Bargarh and Sambalpur districts for the 2019 parliamentary elections and spearheaded chief minister Naveen Patnaik’s election campaign at the Bijepur assembly constituency.During his three-decade-long association with the RSS and later Bajrang Dal, Chouhan was RSS’ joint prachar pramukh between 2000 and 2003 and the national convenor of Bajrang Dal. Chouhan had shot into controversy in 1999 when he alleged that the slain Australian missionary Graham Staines was proselytising tribals in the hinterlands of Keonjhar and Mayurbhanj districts. In all these years, he held forth on his strong views on proselytisation by the missionaries in Kandhamal and other districts of the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjd-leader-subash-chouhan-dies-of-liver-ailment-in-bhubaneswar/story-YHT6ZNfZxHXlEoLa52i5JN.html

10-05-2020||India||India, China face-off along Sikkim border, several soldiers injured||Scores of Indian and Chinese soldiers were involved in a tense face-off along the India-China boundary in north Sikkim on Saturday, two senior officials said on the condition of anonymity.The aggressive confrontation between the troops from the two sides happened near the Naku La sector (ahead of Muguthang), a pass at a height of more than 5,000 metres, said the first officer cited above.Several soldiers were injured in the border stand-off as they exchanged blows.“Four Indian soldiers and seven Chinese troops suffered injuries during the confrontation that involved around 150 soldiers,” said the second officer cited above.He said the face-off was resolved at the local level.Two officials Hindustan Times spoke to in the Army Headquarters denied knowledge of the face-off.The Naku La area was traditionally not prone to face-offs, a former top commander said.This is not the first time Indian and Chinese soldiers have exchanged blows along the border. In August 2017, Indian and Chinese soldiers threw stones at each other and also exchanged blows near Pangong Lake in Ladakh, close to the de facto border between the two countries.The clash near the Line of Actual Control (LAC) aggravated bilateral tensions as it happened at a time when the two neighbours were locked in a long stand-off in the disputed Doklam plateau close to Sikkim.The 73-day Doklam stand-off between India and China along the Sikkim border was likely to be the new normal, the Centre for Joint Warfare Studies (CENJOWS) said in 2017, making a strong case for building military capabilities. The stand-off ended with the withdrawal of troops by both armies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-china-face-off-along-sikkim-border/story-uuZwwSwTzVnZREmpqP0gEJ.html

It is also in this region that the security forces eliminated a top Lashkar terrorist, Haider.Then there is an intelligence alert about plans by the terror group Jaish-e-Mohammed to carry out simultaneous suicide attacks at army and paramiliary bases on Monday, May 11.Top government officials told HT that the NSA also took note of the increased air activity by the Pakistan Air Force along India’s western border that coincided with Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan, and later the foreign office in Islamabad releasing statement that alleged India was looking for a “pretext for a false flag operation targeting Pakistan”.Officials said there was consensus that the Imran Khan government’s effort to distance itself from the terrorists it supports was a pre-emptive move and indicated a renewed push from Pakistani terror launch pads over the next few weeks.The meeting noted how Pakistan was funding outfits such as The Resistance Front or the JK Pir Panjal Peace Forum to claim that terrorism in the valley was indigenous and not sponsored by it. An official said, placing the Pakistan Air Force on high alert was also designed to further Imran Khan’s narrative that asks the international community to intervene lest there is a confrontation between the two nuclear-armed neighbours. The NSA also told officials to step up the engagement with terrorists in the Kashmir valley.The five-hour-long meeting was attended by, among others, Army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane, Intelligence Bureau director Arvinda Kumar, Research and Analysis Wing chief Samant Kumar Goel, Border Security Force director general SS Deswal and Central Reserve Police Force chief AK Maheshwari.A senior counter-terror official told HT that the meeting analysed the infiltration routes used by terrorists from Pakistan and suggested tweaks at the ground level that could ensure that the terrorists were detected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/step-up-anti-terror-ops-in-jammu-and-kashmir-nsa-ajit-doval-to-forces/story-8DmjaVO31xOQQaniuI3B6N.html

He said some people have spread these rumours through social media and many have even tweeted praying for his death.“The country is currently fighting a global epidemic like corona and as I keep busy being the home minister of the country, I did not pay attention to all of this. When this came to my notice late at night, I thought that all these people should enjoy their imaginary thoughts.

So I want to clarify today that I am perfectly healthy and I do not have any disease.”Shah thanked his well-wishers and party workers for their concern about his health. He also thanked those behind the rumours. “I have no ill will or malice towards people who have spread these rumours.

10-05-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||How do you coexist with a virus?How do life, work, and play go on when a highly infective and potentially fatal disease is still extant.It is unlikely the Covid-19 disease will be wiped off the face of the Earth, like small pox was.It is unlikely that there will be a tipping point, a safe-after date, beyond which the virus will not pose a threat to humanity.And finally, even when a vaccine is discovered, it will be some time before everyone in the world has been inoculated against the virus (and knowing how flu viruses work, anyone who wants to be safe may well have to take a shot every year).Yet, life and work (even play) cannot wait. This is not a passing tornado or a storm where one can hunker down and wait for the crisis to pass. There is not going to be an it’s-safe-to-go-out-now moment in this case.Which brings us back to the original question.How do you coexist with a virus?Much of it depends on who you are. If you are a person over the age of 65, or 70, or 75 — different countries will define their senior citizens differently — be prepared to face significant restrictions on what you can and can’t do, and where you can and can’t go. This could last till a vaccine is discovered and widely available, or until we achieve herd immunity (60-65% of the population is infected, which means it is immune).Schools and offices will continue to function, but again, with significant restrictions and very strict sanitation and social distancing protocols. Many people will be encouraged to work from home, and a lot of learning and assessment will move online.Travel, especially international travel, will be restricted, cumbersome and expensive. The UK has already said it will enforce a 14-day quarantine for air passengers; many other countries will insist on similar quarantines; and that will pretty much kill business travel. No one is going to want to make a four-day business trip to another country if it is book-ended by 14-day quarantines. To be sure, there will be green travel channels, even between countries, but these will emerge over time, as more people, companies, and countries get used to living with the virus. Domestic travel will be easier, but not entirely without curbs. And both domestic and international travel may require screening for the coronavirus disease, perhaps even rapid testing.Huge recreational events are out for now. If a vaccine isn’t in place and widely available by early next year, it is unlikely that the Olympic Games will take place. Indeed, mammoth multilateral sporting games are probably going to be the very last thing on anybody’s list of what’s safe. Theatre and musical performances will move online, and we will probably see significant innovations in the space, thanks to virtual reality and augmented reality. Gyms, health clubs, and swimming pools may not open for a long time, and while restaurants will, dining out will be a very different experience and also an expensive affair.Fear of the coronavirus disease will restrict our movements and interactions, and while there may be few of us willing to risk it all, families, societies, organisations, service providers, even governments will try and insist that people follow basic safety protocols in everything they do. And all of this will happen. This is how individuals, companies, and governments are thinking right now.This, then, is the new normal.By early next year, if there is no vaccine (or even if there is), we will all know how to be safe, and how to carry on with life and work in a new world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-W6vblbEBExVcwo0XzR6ixL.html
10-05-2020||India||AAP MLA, aide held in 52-year-old doctor’s suicide case||Delhi’s ruling Aam Aadmi Party lawmaker Prakash Jarwal and his aide, Kapil Nagar, were arrested on Saturday in connection with a case of alleged extortion and abetment to suicide of a 52-year-old doctor last month. A Delhi court had issued non-bailable warrants against the two on Friday. “After questioning, Prakash Jarwal and Kapil Nagar have been arrested in the case,” said deputy police commissioner (south) Atul Kumar Thakur. A case was registered against the two after the doctor’s son blamed them for his father’s death on April 18. The doctor also supplied water tankers to the Delhi Jal Board. The family had accused Jarwal of extortion, an allegation denied by the MLA. A police officer said notices were sent to Jarwal and Nagar to join the investigation. But they never turned up. Jarwal’s lawyer Mohammad Irshaad had applied for an anticipatory bail. Later he said his client was arrested when he went for routine questioning. “We will move court for a regular bail on Monday,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aap-mla-aide-held-in-52-year-old-doctor-s-suicide-case/story-aaYETHugVZBZv9gPqZrVwN.html
10-05-2020||India||Reviving economy in Covid-19 fight to top agenda of PM meet||Prime Minister Narendra Modi may meet chief ministers as early as Tuesday, May 12, to discuss the next stage in the exit from the nationwide lockdown enforced to fight the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), government officials familiar with the matter said. They added that the focus of the meeting will be on a further increase in economic activities and on tackling the pandemic in containment zones.On Saturday, Cabinet secretary Rajeev Gauba held two back-to-back meetings to identify possible areas that can be opened up after May 17. In one of the meetings, the focus turned to areas that have witnessed a sharp rise in Covid-19 cases in the past week, a person familiar with the discussion said on condition of anonymity. According to the government officials cited in the first instance, who asked not to be named, plans are afoot for the PM’s fifth meeting with the CMs since March 20. The meeting comes ahead of May 17, when the second extension of the lockdown ends, although, with more activities permitted, and people allowed to move around in many parts of the country, this period has been more a graded exit than a continuation of a hard lockdown. The lockdown, enforced on March 25, was originally supposed to end on April 14. It was then extended to May 3, and then again to May 17. According to the people familiar with the matter, there will definitely be more concessions in terms of what’s allowed, but that there will likely be no changes in Covid-19 hotspots and containment zones. A second person familiar with the happenings at Gauba’s meeting described it as a preliminary discussion during which several ideas were tossed around about industries or sectors that can be opened up. “A final decision is expected only next week and after one or two more rounds of meetings,” this person added on condition of anonymity. “But one thing looks increasingly clear,” said this person. “It will take some time before the rail and aviation sectors can resume operations.”Apart from the economy and the management of the disease in hot spots, the meeting between Modi and the CMs could also see some discussion on the migrant workers who have returned home, and stranded Indians who are being flown back from many parts of the world. Modi’s last meeting with CMs—through video conference—was held on April 27. Most of the states expressed their willingness to partially lift the Covid-19 lockdown during that. Days after the meeting, the government issued federal guidelines allowing the functioning of industries and offices, movement of people, and the opening up of stores selling non-essentials outside the containment zones with an eye on reviving the economy. At the same time, it said the lockdown would run for another two weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/reviving-economy-in-covid-fight-to-top-agenda-of-pm-meet/story-yNuRc1T3pDWESmm7150JOI.html
10-05-2020||India||Injustice with migrants in West Bengal, says Amit Shah||Union home minister Amit Shah has written to West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee that the Centre was not receiving the “expected support” from her government in helping migrant workers reach home, an allegation the Trinamool Congress (TMC) rubbished as “outright lies”.The state government is doing “injustice” to Bengali migrant workers stranded across the country by not allowing “Shramik” (worker) trains run by the railways to reach the state, Shah wrote in the letter,according to ministry of home affairs (MHA) officials.Shah said the Centre had already facilitated the return home of more than 200,000 workers, adding that migrants from West Bengal employed elsewhere too were eager to go back home.“West Bengal government is not allowing trains with migrants reaching the state. This is injustice with WB migrant labourers. This will create further hardship for them,”Shah wrote.States with large migrant populations such as Bihar and Uttar Pradesh have received the maximum number of workers returning home on Shramik trains.West Bengal, senior officials said, has received only two special trains so far and hasn’t cleared any more trains.Until Friday, more than 250,000 migrants had been sent home on 251 Shramik trains.The TMC hit back at Shah.“Amit Shah’s letter is full of outright lies. Two trains have already reached and eight more are expected to reach Bengal in the coming three days. Overall, 80,000 people have been brought back using various means of transport. Amit Shah just woke up from his 40-day sleep but when one writes a letter still in his sleep, the person gets the facts all wrong,” TMC Rajya Sabha leader and national spokesperson Derek O’Brien said on Saturday.O’Brien presented a document showing that two trains each from Punjab and Tamil Nadu and three from Karnataka are in the draft schedule of special trains, as of May 8, for reaching seven districts of Bengal between May 10 and 12, carrying 12,714 passengers altogether. Another train is scheduled to arrive in Malda district on May 10, carrying 1,7 21 passengers from Telangana.“We have a seven-stage plan to bring back the migrants. We are doing it in a staggered manner. We did not announce a lockdown without an iota of planning. We don’t want to bring the migrant workers without a proper plan as we are considering all possible implications to find the best way to do it,” O’Brien said.Shortly after the TMC leader’s remarks, the railway ministry tweeted: “Indian Railways has so far run more then 300 trains mainly for states like UP, Bihar, Odisha, MP etc. But for WB till today morning we had received approval for only 2 Shramik special trains, 1 from Ajmer Sharif & other from Ernakulam. After request of Hon’ble HM, today afternoon WB has approved 2 trains from Punjab, 2 from TN, 3 from Karnataka & 1 from Telangana, which are being arranged. However, WB has not approved any train from Maharashtra, while there is a requirement of 16 trains to WB and presently 6 requests are pending for which approval is still awaited from WB.”The issue of migrant workers is the latest flashpoint between the Centre and the West Bengal government amid a row over the state’s efforts to control the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The two sides have clashed over a visit by interministerial central teams (IMCTs) for an assessment of the situation in seven West Bengal districts. While the teams claimed that they didn’t get any support from the state government in assessing measures put in place to control Covid-19, the state government accused the Centre of politicising a public health crisis.Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla had on Thursday slammed the West Bengal government for a low rate of testing and high rate of mortality – 13.2%, by far the highest for any state. The Centre has also accused the Trinamool Congress government of not allowing cross-border movement of goods trucks to Bangladesh, potentially jeopardising trade commitments made to the neighbour.Mamata Banerjee’s nephew and TMC youth wing chief Abhishek Banerjee wrote on Twitter that the Union home minister should apologise if he failed to substantiate the charges in his letter with facts. The Congress added another political twist.“The chief minister has given permission to eight more trains after Shah wrote to the state,” alleged Congress leader in the Lok Sabha, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, who is an MP from Berhampore in West Bengal. O’Brien denied the allegation.Bengal has reported 1,786 Covid-19 positive cases and 99 deaths until Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/injustice-with-migrants-in-w-bengal-says-shah/story-OU4qs8ZpesB3MB5tUZHuNO.html

In all, there have now been 62,715 people infected by the Sars-Cov-2 virus, which causes Covid-19, and 2,025 fatalities. Roughly 19,165 people have recovered from the disease.The highest number of cases continued to be detected from Maharashtra, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and Delhi, with the national capital reporting a lower-than-usual number as officials changed the classification of the 24-hour period.According to Union health minister Harsh Vardhan, India has now raised its testing capacity to 95,000 per day and a total 1,525,631 tests have been conducted so far across 332 government and 121 private laboratories. “We do not anticipate a very worst type of situation in our country like many other developed countries but still we have prepared the whole country for the worst situation,” Harsh Vardhan said at meeting to review the status of Covid-19 outbreak in northeastern states. The health minister said there are now 8,043 hospitals dedicated for Covid-19 patients with a total capacity of 1.67 million beds and the country was adequately prepared to handle a surge in cases. Globally, the virus has now infected over 4 million people and claimed the lives of at least 277,000 people in what is the worst pandemic the world has seen since the Spanish Flu in 1918. The health minister’s remarks came a day after a top government official said India now needs to learn to live with the virus. “We will have to learn to live with the virus, for which it is important to make critical behavioral changes and incorporate all the preventive guidelines that health ministry has been issuing on following hand hygiene, cough etiquettes and social distancing measures, as part of your daily routine. It is an everyday battle for us to keep the infection at bay,” said Lav Agarwal, health ministry joint secretary, in a briefing on Friday.Authorities are now focusing on 10 states that account for the most number of cases. “The ministry of health and family welfare has decided to deploy central teams to 10 states that have witnessed/are witnessing high case load and high spurt of cases. The teams will assist state health departments of respective states to facilitate management of the outbreak,” the health ministry said in a statement on Saturday.The expert teams consist of a senior official from the health ministry, a joint secretary-level nodal officer, and a public health expert. The states where the teams are being sent are Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.The outbreak in India began on March 2 and by the end of the month, the country was under a sweeping lockdown that helped avert a situation of the kind seen in several populous countries where tens of thousands have now died. But pressure to relax the curbs is now growing, with large number of people having lost their livelihoods – especially those from lower economic groups such as factory workers and daily wage earners who have been walking in the thousands to their hometowns hundreds of kilometers away.The movement has also raised fears of infections growing as the tens of thousands taking the trains come in potential contact that could spread the virus. Similar concerns also surround Indians returning from abroad. On Saturday, at least two foreign returnees who reached Kerala on May 7 in two separate first-day flights -- one from Dubai and another from Abu Dhabi – tested positive for the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-coronavirus-cases-hit-60k-fatalities-exceed-2-000/story-LrlAtsv1puqmppgWyqOMXL.html
10-05-2020||India||Aurangabad train tragedy: Bodies of 16 labourers brought home to MP||The bodies of the 16 labourers, who were run over by a freight train near Maharashtra’s Aurangabad on Friday, were brought to their native Madhya Pradesh on a special train on Saturday. The labourers were from Shahdol and Umaria districts and were sleeping on train tracks after a long journey on foot en route to Madhya Pradesh when they were killed. They were in a group of 20 people, who had left Jalna for their villages the previous evening without waiting for their employer to pay their wages as factories remained shut due to the nationwide lockdown imposed since late March to check the Covid-19 spread. The labourers -- 11 from Shadol and 5 from Umaria -- had unsuccessfully tried to get passes for the special trains that the railways started last week for the people stranded across the country because of the lockdown. Tens of thousands of workers have been walking home from big cities after losing their jobs due to the lockdown. “Two special bogies were attached to the train, which carried about 1,300 labourers from Aurangabad, to bring back the bodies. The bodies were later sent to Shahdol and Umaria. There were two injured labourers from Mandla, who were sent in an ambulance,” said Jabalpur police superintendent (railways) SS Jain.Last rites were performed in presence of administrative authorities, according to officials. Jabalpur collector Bharat Yadav said all the labourers, who came from Aurangabad, belong to villages in Jabalpur, Shahdol and Rewa and were subjected to medical examinations at the railway station before they were sent to their native homes on buses with arrangements for food and water.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aurangabad-train-tragedy-bodies-of-16-labourers-brought-home-to-mp/story-y60VHfkLg6CpXbxjTfrCjJ.html
10-05-2020||India||States told to document food needs of migrants amid Covid-19 lockdown||The Centre on Saturday said it is planning measures to ease difficulties that migrant workers were facing and states ought to prepare local databases urgently to be able to respond to their immediate needs of food and shelter as thousands of them left jobless because of the Covid-19 lockdown continued to leave cities. Union food and public distribution minister Ram Vilas Paswan said he has asked food ministers of states to document and locate migrant workers in major cities, give them provisional ration cards and provide estimates of ration to federal authorities.“The Prime Minister is worried. I am worried. But we need a system to take food to the migrants. That is why we have recommended state food ministers that at least basic details such as location, number of migrants, clusters, and food requirements must be prepared urgently,” Paswan said. Paswan said 810 million beneficiaries, nearly two-thirds of the population, of the public distribution system, who are eligible for subsidised food, were receiving their regular ration. Under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana, these beneficiaries are also being given double their current food entitlement free of cost for three months. The scheme was launched on March 26 to protect the poor from the impact of national lockdown imposed to contain the spread of Covid-19.“We have told food ministers if there are needy people who may or may not have a ration card, or are outside the system, like migrant workers, we have enough stocks,” Paswan said. He said states could also organise kitchens by utilizing funds under the State Disaster Relief Fund and National Disaster Relief Fund to tide over the immediate crisis.Some states have to start provisioning for migrant workers, Paswan said. “The Centre will provide grains as per the current requirements. But we need estimates. How do you intervene otherwise?” he asked. “The Delhi government has said it was reaching 10 lakhs [1 million], such people, for instance.”India has an estimated 140 million migrant workers who keep the urban economy afloat. They belong mostly to poorer states such as Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, and Bihar and shift to more prosperous ones like Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu to work as manual labour. Many haul bricks and building material at construction sites or work in shifts in factories. Jobless migrant workers were caught in a survival battle as factories, shops, and labour sites were shut with the imposition of the lockdown on March 25. Many of them began walking home hundreds of miles away under harsh conditions, hungry, thirsty and tired, and set off an unprecedented crisis. Federally held food stocks currently stand at around 56 million tonne, while 6 million tonne is needed for the next three months. “How would it feel if the weakest members of a family starve despite the household’s granary being full?” asked economist Jean Drèze, a long-time advocate of the right to food. He said food should be given without documentation to everyone who needs it. Drèze has urged for universalizing access to the public distribution system. Construction is the single largest source of employment for migrant workers in India. According to the National Sample Survey Office data, 33.3 million people moved out of farming to the construction sector between 2004-05 and 2011-12.The plight of migrant workers could have been cushioned by a federal programme launched last year to make subsidized rations portable. The programme, known as ‘One Nation One Ration Card’, is still work in progress. The scheme is still not fully geared for seamless inter-state transactions. Inter-state portability, whereby a migrant gets food in a state other than his own, is being tried in select clusters of 12 contiguous states. Paswan said he had approved the on-boarding of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Dadra & Nagar Haveli and Daman & Diu on the ‘One Nation One Ration Card’ platform. According to Chinmay Tumbe, the author of ‘India Moving - A History of Migration’ and faculty at Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad, India’s migration is circular in the sense that people keep moving from city to city until they return home at one point before moving out again. This means a portable food distribution system has to be capable of continually tracking migrant workers, who make up 29% of the nation’s workforce.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-told-to-document-food-needs-of-migrants/story-eSlT6b3a4MfTRyCmm4qnCM.html
10-05-2020||India||55 arrested after police, migrants clash in Gujarat’s Surat||Police in Gujarat’s Surat fired tear gas shells on Saturday to disperse angry migrant workers, who had taken to the streets at Mora demanding that trains be arranged for their return to their homes in Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, and Bihar. This is the fifth such protest in Surat over the last month amid job losses because of the national lockdown that was imposed in March to check the Covid-19 pandemic.“Thousands of workers gathered on streets at the Mora village next to the industrial belt of Hazira. They were demanding that they be sent to their home states. When police stopped them, they pelted stones and attacked them,” said Surat’s police commissioner D N Patel.He said the police resorted to “mild” lathi-charge and tear gas shelling to disperse the crowd. “We have arrested 55 people so far and around 50 others have been detained. More accused are been identified with the help of drones and CCTV footage,” Patel said.A team of State Reserve Police has been deployed in the area to monitor the situation.On Monday, 204 people were arrested in Surat on charges of attempt to murder and rioting after migrant workers allegedly attacked policemen as they gathered to demand their return to their native place. On April 29, five people were detained and another 300 booked for alleged rioting and violating the Covid-19 following a clash between migrant workers and police.The state government on Tuesday formed a committee to ensure the management and coordination for sending migrant workers from Surat to their native districts. Gujarat police chief Shivanand Jha said attacks on “corona warriors” will not be tolerated at any cost and the attackers will face strict actions.“During the lockdown, some people are making efforts to mislead the citizens of the state to protest against the lockdown while the lockdown is for the benefit of the citizens. Such individuals will be traced and subjected to legal action,” Jha said.Ashwani Kumar, Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani’s secretary, said 327 special trains have been operated for migrant workers across India. “Out of that, Gujarat has operated 147 trains, or 45% of the total trains, to ensure a safe return of over 2.04 lakh migrant workers to Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Orissa, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. The chief minister has urged the migrant workers to be patient as the process for sending them back home demands time,” said Kumar.Ramdev Kumar, a construction worker from Rajasthan, said, “We have run out of money and other resources. We work hard on daily basis to feed our families. But for 50 days, we have not had any work. That is why we want to return to our native places...”. .Surat is India’s diamond hub and according to an Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad study, migrants account for about 70% of its workforce and 50% of that of Ahmedabad.Gagan Bihari Sahu, an associate professor at Surat’s Centre for Social Studies, said that the nationwide lockdown has hit migrant workers badly. “The production has come to a standstill, machines are quiet and markets are closed. In spite of the government’s appeal, many employers have either removed their workers, deducted salaries or simply closed doors,” he said. “How are these migrants and their families going to sustain...”Migrant workers have continued to walk and cycle back to their homes even as the railways last week began running special trains and some state governments deployed buses for the people stranded because of the Covid-19 lockdown. Some do not have documents needed to register for the trains. Others do not want to wait any longer. And in other cases, the trains have not been approved by states that have to receive the migrant workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/55-arrested-after-police-migrants-clash-in-surat/story-KC2XFIGcbwtAPeeMyeTkXO.html
10-05-2020||India||Covid-19 cases surge in 4 states after returning migrants test positive||A spurt in Covid-19 cases in Bihar, Odisha, Rajasthan and Jharkhand since May 1, has been linked to migrant workers who have returned from various cities across the country, state officials said, confirming the fear that rural India is no longer safe from the coronavirus pandemic that has affected 62750 people nationally so far. This realisation has also caused panic among health experts, as till now nearly 80% of the cases recorded have been seen in urban areas, where the infrastructure needed to treat a victim of a pandemic, is better.Ever since a nationwide lockdown was announced starting March 25, migrant workers from across the country began to walk and cycle back to their home states even as a few states like Delhi deployed buses to ferry some of them home. Last week, the Indian Railway began running special trains for migrants separated from their families on account of the lockdown and stranded without any earnings. However, as they have begun to reach their home states and are being placed in quarantine centres, governments are grappling with the ramifications of the pandemic reaching rural areas.According to the union health ministry, across India there is a shortfall of primary healthcare centres and community healthcare centres by 22% and 30% respectively. The largest shortfall is in states like West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh —incidentally, most of the migrant workers who travel the length and breadth of the country for work in factories and other industries, like construction, hail from these six states.“Although Asha workers in rural areas monitor health, there is no quality infrastructure to deal with a pandemic like coronavirus. Around half of the health personnel posts in rural India are vacant,” said Amulya Nidhi, member of Jan Swasthya Abhiyan, a network of non-governmental organisations working in the area of public health.New cases linked to migrants Bihar, where 70% of the new cases since May 1 have been detected in migrant workers, has not as yet revealed where they have returned from. But Jharkhand and Odisha, which has seen a similar spurt in cases, have revealed that information. So far, Surat, a textile hub in Gujarat which has the second highest number of Covid cases in the state after Ahmedabad, has emerged as one of the biggest centres of Covid-19 for migrant workersIn Jharkhand, one-third of the 154 positive cases spread over 13 districts have been reported in the past week, around the time that migrant workers began to reach their home state. According to the state health department’s bulletin issued on Saturday morning, 20 confirmed cases were found in Garhwa district and two cases were detected in Koderma district. “All the 20 migrant labourers, aged between 18-40 years, had arrived in Garhwa on May 5. They were part of 51 passengers who came here by a bus from Surat. All of them are in quarantine,” said district’s said sub-divisional officer Kamleshwar Narayan. The quarantine centre is an under-construction jail. At present, it houses 158 migrants, a majority of whom have returned from Surat, Narayan said. “Results of samples collected on May 6-7 have not yet come,” he said, indicating that these numbers may well rise.While Covid-19 positive migrant workers have been shifted to a dedicated hospital in the district, Koderma was reverted to an orange zone after two workers who arrived from Surat and Varanasi, tested positive.All the 100 fresh Covid-19 cases reported in the last 24 hours in coastal Ganjam district of Odisha are returnees from Surat, said Ganjam district collector Vijay Aamrita Kulange. In other Covid-19 hotspots such as Jajpur, Bhubaneswar, Balasore, Bhadrak and Rourkela, most of those who have tested positive in the past fortnight are migrant workers who have returned from Surat.In Bihar, 100 workers tested positive on Saturday taking the total number of cases to 589. “Going by our experience over the past 10 days, almost 60% to 70% of the tested samples which came positive were of people who came from outside the state,” said Bihar’s principal secretary (health) Sanjay Kumar. That’s 224 new cases already. Health secretary Lokesh Kumar Singh said that migrant workers housed in quarantine centres at Khagaria, Samastipur, Muzaffarpur and Begusarai have tested positive till now.As the number of cases increase, state governments have decided to expand the period of quarantine for returnees to 28 days. “Returnees from other states will have to undergo an institutional quarantine of 21 days followed by home quarantine for next 7 days,” Odisha’s chief spokesperson on the state’s pandemic efforts, Subroto Bagchi, said. On Saturday, Kulange said, Section 144 was imposed around all Covid-19 temporary medical camps/institutional quarantine centres where migrants have been quarantined after reports emerged that people had violated lockdown norms. In one quarantine centre of Sergarh block, where 80 migrant workers recently returned from Surat are housed, family members were seen delivering food and betel nut violating social distancing norms. The DM has issued orders that no one would be allowed to enter within 100 metres radius of these centres.Numbers expected to swellOn Saturday, five special trains carrying migrants from Gujarat, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu set out for Odisha. They are expected to reach on Sunday. So far about 46,000 migrant workers have returned to Odisha and another 500,000 migrants are expected to arrive in the following week.Since May 2, 78,706 migrant workers have reached their home state in Bihar through 69 special trains. Twelve trains carrying 14,245 migrant workers reached Bihar on Saturday; 14 more, carrying 17,054 workers, are lined up for Sunday, Anupam Kumar, secretary, information and public relations department said.Officials in Rajasthan also said the majority of new cases were reported from the border districts of Gujarat, from where the migrant workers have returned. Since Friday, the government has sealed its border with Gujarat and other states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cases-surge-in-4-states-after-returning-migrants-test-ve/story-kF5P3sHciQWQmUZwpqsskK.html
10-05-2020||India||Rahul Gandhi reiterates demand for audit of PM-Cares fund||Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Saturday reiterated his demand for an audit of the Prime Minister’s Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations (PM-Cares) Fund, created in March to fund relief measures aimed at easing the distress caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown.“The #PmCares fund has received huge contributions from PSUs {public sector undertakings} & major public utilities like the Railways,” Gandhi tweeted. “It’s important that PM ensures the fund is audited & that the record of money received and spent is available to the public,” added Gandhi, who voiced a similar demand at a news conference on Friday. “The PM-Cares Fund should be audited. We should know about the donors and the donations. We should know who gave how much. There is no problem in saying that,” Gandhi had said.Last week, he had hit out at the railways for charging fare to transport migrant workers returning to their home states and giving donation to the PM-Cares Fund. In a tweet in Hindi, Gandhi had said, “On one hand the Railways is extorting ticket fare from labourers stranded in different states, on the other hand the Rail Ministry is depositing donations of Rs 151 crore in PM Cares fund. Please solve this puzzle. “Earlier in the day, the Congress accused both the Centre and the Delhi government of being non-transparent in reporting the coronavirus cases.Senior Congress leader Ajay Maken told reporters that there was “confusion” within the Centre in its fight against the Covid-19, and asked how India would tackle the pandemic if officials continued to speak in different voices.Maken referred to “differing” comments made by some officials on the Covid-19 situation in the country and urged the government to tell the people clearly about the exact state of the pandemic to enable them to prepare accordingly.He also asked the Arvind Kejriwal-led government in Delhi to be more transparent in reporting the coronavirus cases.Maken’s comments came as confusion prevailed over the number of deaths due to the coronavirus in the national capital, with data from four hospitals showing that 92 people succumbed to the infection as against 68 deaths reported by the Delhi government.“It is a matter of shame that the national capital is witnessing a sorry state of affairs” n the fight against the pandemic,” the Congress leader said.He said there should be more coordination between states and the central government, and urged the Centre to spell out a clear exit strategy for the lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-reiterates-demand-for-audit-of-pm-cares-fund/story-mSNo4mRMg5iww6rCGX2UTK.html
10-05-2020||India||Central govt teams rushed to 10 states with high Covid-19 caseload||The Centre decided on Saturday to rush teams of health experts to 10 states with the maximum number of Covid-19 cases to help state governments contain the rapid spread of the infection.“The ministry of health and family welfare has decided to deploy central teams to 10 states that have witnessed/are witnessing high case load and high spurt of cases. The teams will assist the state health departments of respective states to facilitate management of Covid-19 outbreak,” the ministry said in a statement on Saturday night.The expert teams consist of a senior official from the health ministry, a joint secretary-level nodal officer, and a public health expert. The team is meant to support the state health departments in implementation of containment measures in the affected areas within the respective states’ districts or cities.The teams will be deployed to Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Between them, the 10 states have 38,000 infections that make up 60% of India’s total Covid-19 caseload, as of Saturday, according to the HT dashboard.Last week, the Centre had rushed 20 central teams of public health experts to 20 high case load districts. Another high-level team, led by joint secretary in the health ministry, Lav Agarwal, had also visited Mumbai to support efforts in Covid-19 response and management in India’s worst-affected state, Maharashtra.Earlier in the day, Union health minister Harsh Vardhan said that as of Saturday, the Covid-19 fatality rate in the country is 3.3%, and recovery rate 29.9%. He also said the doubling rate stood at 9.9 days over the past week. HT’s internal dashboard puts the figure at 10.7 days.The announcement came at a review of Covid situation in north-eastern states that have reported a total of 194 cases. The maximum cases have been reported from Tripura (118).“As of yesterday there are 2.41% present active Covid-19 patients in ICU [intensive care unit], 0.38% on ventilators and 1.88% on oxygen support. The testing capacity has increased in the country and it is 95,000 tests per day, with 332 government laboratories and 121 private laboratories operation for Covid testing. Cumulatively, 15,25,631 tests have been done so far for COVID-19,” said Harsh Vardhan.He also said that surveillance for Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (SARI) and Influenza Like Illness (ILI) should be intensified in unaffected districts and districts that have not reported cases for the last 14 days through the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme network in collaboration with medical college hospitals.Appreciating the efforts of states that have banned the use of chewing tobacco and imposed fines for spitting in public places, he said, “In view of the larger prevalence of non-smoking tobacco usage in some of the states, they should take concrete actions for prohibiting their wide usage and for prohibiting spitting in public places which shall help in preventing the spread of Covid-19. Strong reforms are needed in this direction.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/central-govt-teams-rushed-to-10-states-with-high-caseload/story-oxq9H6ywQy0vYUTGT34tRO.html
10-05-2020||India||Aarogya Setu gave forecasts regarding 650 Covid-19 clusters||The Aarogya Setu predicted 650 potential coronavirus disease (Covid-19) hotspots correctly and more than 300 others that could turn into one, the government’s advisory body Niti Aayog said in a statement, while adding that close to 100 million people have now registered on it. The tool is meant to speed up tracing of contacts of an infected person so that they can be isolated before they spread the disease further, but has become controversial due to the amount of personal data – such as location details – it requires and possible vulnerabilities in its design and coding that could expose such information. With the new details, the developers now suggest the analysis of the data could be helpful. “Using syndromic mapping and trace history of Covid-19 positive people combined with their movement patterns and exposure of different regions to Covid-19, the Aarogya Setu team has forecasted more than 650 hotspots across the country at sub-post office level, in addition to more than 300+ emerging hotspots which could have been missed otherwise,” the Niti Aayog said. In Maharashtra, which is one of the worst-affected states, the app identified at least 60 hotspots across 18 districts. Officials in Maharashtra, however, said the application was more useful for individuals than the administration “because authorities already have this information with them”. “As such, it will be easier for individuals to find such hot spots to avoid further spread of the disease. In fact, this application will be more useful after the end of the lockdown,” said Pradeep Awate, Maharashtra’s state health surveillance officer.“For the 130 hotspot predictions made by the app across India at the sub-post office level between April 13 and April 20, every forecasted hotspot has since been declared a real hotspot by the health ministry 3 to 17 days after it was first predicted. This ability to accurately forecast hotspots is a much-needed breakthrough, first of its kind in the world which India will deploy as a powerful tool to fight the contagion and help the world do the same. Aarogya Setu is not just predicting hotspots, it is enabling prevention of hotspots,” said the Niti Aayog release. HT could not verify these hotspots since the agency did not release a list of these locations.Since its launch on April 2, the app has already seen 96 million registrations. It is now mandatory for people going to work during the lockdown period, which makes India the only democracy where the mobile phone software is compulsory in some form. Health officials say the tool will help fill gaps in human resources to monitor the outbreak. “It is definitely an application for the future as far as disease surveillance is concerned because India is a huge country and it is practically not possible to cover the entire population over and over again manually. That’s when this kind of technology can be made use of. However, the only thing that needs to be considered is that it will be most effective when everyone has downloaded the application,” said Dr Sujeet K Singh, director, national centre for disease control. Principal scientific advisor to the Prime Minister, Prof K VijayRaghavan, added: “The app allows consent-driven identification of individuals who were in proximity to those who are tested positive; amongst these there will be several who are eligible for tests. When these people were tested, several turned out to be positive.”Aarogya Setu gets real-time testing alerts on Covid-19 positives from across India. Of the 12,500 users with the app installed who tested positive so far, Bluetooth-based interaction data led to more than 60,000 people being assessed and alerted as at various degrees of risk and, advised accordingly whether to self-isolate, quarantine or go for a test. Of the 8,500 tested from the set of people assessed as high-risk (and recommended to be tested), around 23% tested positive so far, the developers said.“While this is a valuable consequence of using the app, there is another consequence that is being used and is also very valuable. By mapping symptoms and trace history of Covid-19 positive people, and combining with their movement patterns, the team also studied these in relation to available exposure of different regions to Covid-19. This analysis showed an ability to forecast hotspots a short while in advance of their becoming so. Many of these hotspots were already on the health ministry’s radar but a substantial number were novel. This information, when relayed to the health system, allows this additional information to be used in helping to prevent hotspots from maturing, along with other data available,” VijayRaghavan added.So far, 69 million people have taken the app’s self-assessment test, with an adoption rate of about 71%, of which at least 3.4 million have self-declared themselves as unwell (showing one or more of the three symptoms). A dedicated team of more than 70 doctors and healthcare workers have reached out to about 650,000 individuals with Covid-like symptoms and triaged their medical condition. More than 16,000 people have been administered follow-up tele-consultation by doctors, free of cost.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aarogya-setu-alerted-about-650-clusters/story-1kvGonSkLz77dwH3zMYOQI.html
10-05-2020||India||Maharashtra crosses 20,000 Covid-19 cases with 1,165 new infections||Maharashtra reported 1,165 Covid-19 cases on Saturday to cross the 20,000 infection mark and also registered the highest single-day fatalities with 48 deaths. The state capital of Mumbai recorded 722 cases, taking the tally in India’s worst-affected city to 12,864.The spike came on a day new commissioner of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) Iqbal Singh Chahal said his two priorities are to minimise the number of coronavirus cases in Mumbai and have the city prepared for the upcoming monsoon season.Chahal, an 1989 batch IAS officer, took charge late on Friday after the state government transferred previous BMC commissioner Parveen Pardeshi to the urban development department.Maharashtra reported its first Covid-19 case on March 9 and took nearly 53 days to reach the 10,000 mark. The next 10,000 cases were registered in just nine days.The state health department said 178 patients from the Mumbai Metropolitan Region were added to the Indian Council of Medical Research data of cases on its portal, but the reconciliation of the figures by the state was yet to be done. The state also stated that since the collection of data was a progressive process, so the numbers could vary.Of the 48 deaths registered on Saturday, 27 were in Mumbai, nine in Pune and eight in Malegaon in Nashik district. Pune rural, Nanded, Akola and Amravati saw one death each. Twenty seven of the patients who died on Saturday were above 60 years of age, while 18 were in the age group of 40-59years. At least 28 of them had high-risk comorbidities.The mortality rate in the state stood at 3.83%, down from 7.21% on April 12, but the number of deaths is increasing. The country’s mortality rate hovers around 3.32%. According to a report by the medical education and drugs department, the highest (21.91%) chunk of patients are between 21 and 30 years, followed by those in the 31 to 40 age group (21%).The report also highlighted 73% of the fatalities had high-risk comorbidities like diabetes, hypertension and heart ailment, among others. At least 59% of patients found positive after their tests were asymptomatic. Among the municipal corporations, Mumbai, Thane, Pune, Aurangbad, Navi Mumbai are the most affected cities. 86.48% of the total cases till Friday are from the Mumbai Metropolitan Region and Pune Metropolitan Region, which house roughly 30 % (35 million) of the state’s population.. The state government, which has hinted at an extension of the ongoing lockdown in MMR and PMR, has directed the municipal corporations in the worst-affected cities to concentrate on containment zones “We may extend some relaxations for the industries after third phase of lockdown ending on May 17 in the orange and green zones. Red zones too may have a brief relaxations outside the containment zones, but at the same time the implementation of the lockdown in containment zones would be stricter,” said a senior bureaucrat.The number of tests in the state touched 227,804 on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maha-crosses-20k-cases-with-1-165-new-infections/story-EJ7rF7vS2EXv75M3sSGC8H.html

Edited excerpts:Do you think the TMC government has failed to tackle the Covid-19 outbreak?Nationally and globally, monumental lapses of Mamata Banerjee in tackling Covid-19 [outbreak] are headlines. Gruesome reports of the disposal of Covid-19 dead bodies from several areas with heartless, indescribable insensitivity is unconscionably shocking. People are traumatised at this callous stance. Their sentiments are outraged and mercilessly trampled. We would never be able to come out of the sordid saga and shame of Dhapa [a garbage dumping ground where Covid-19 victims are cremated]. It will haunt us for long. Bengal, unfortunately, is emerging as a police state with anyone posting on social media to the distaste of the ruling dispensation gets a police knock and thereafter…Is the state solely responsible for this failure or, did the Centre also react late, as alleged by TMC?The Prime Minister’s handling of Covid-19 has been nationally and globally appreciated. His consensual approach with statesmanship stance resulted in rare support by the people. Mamata Banerjee is the only CM to be in stand-alone mode.The Centre has been in affirmative mode. The home ministry’s eye opener communication on April 10 came as a relief to the people. Because of her political antenna being ever up and [her] eye being on vote bank politics, the fight against Covid-19 has been severely compromised. Do you think the state government tried to conceal the actual death toll by forming the audit committee, as alleged by the BJP?Right from the word go, the cover up operation to fudge and stagger figures was operationalised. There is no credibility to the state’s data.Some things are looking up after the IMCT”s catalysed and affirmative action. Yet, much is to be done. After coming under fire from every quarter, she [Banerjee] had to virtually disband the cover up operation [of the] audit committee.How do you see this as a government’s role in protecting citizens?This is a cause for serious concern. She looks at issues through the political prism and this resulted in dilution of lockdown protocol, ineffective enforcement of social distancing and holding of banned religious congregations under the very nose of the police. TMC leaders across the board openly say on television that you speak the language of the BJP. Do you see this as an insult to your Constitutional position?All of them are playing to the tune of the remote control authority. I lament their lack of freedom. It is an open secret. I have a personal equation with many of them. It is worrisome how these leaders have been emasculated and tamed. Such a spineless stance is a challenge to democracy. A recent phenomenon that is in circulation is that even [their] social media accounts are controlled.Never before have we seen a Bengal governor writing so frequently on social media on issues that are generally perceived to be internal matters between the state and Raj Bhawan. Why do you do it?Firstly, social media is a recent phenomenon and thus comparison is inappropriate. Nationally and globally you will notice people in public life using social media. Taking to social media per se should not be an issue. I would be enlightened if content thereof is inappropriate. No one has so far said so. I can’t help if there is fear of truth. I am motivated only by the welfare of the people, whom I am constitutionally ordained to serve.Trinamool Congress leaders and even some from the Congress and Left parties say no governor behaved with the state government the way you do. Do you think your predecessors never found any reason to point out to the government that they were doing anything wrong?Earlier governors too got the taste of her [Banerjee’s] mercurial behaviour. I adhere to the script of the Constitution while she acts on an external script. I have never transgressed constitutional limits and no such act has ever been pointed out to me by the government.There are no takers for her recent stance that the governor is making efforts to usurp powers. All these are diversionary tactics to cover up her monumental lapses, particularly during the Covid-19 [outbreak].||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-s-fight-against-covid-compromised-guv-dhankhar/story-kP21M8FGqUnBwcKhVY9wvJ.html

A central team led by All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) director Randeep Guleria visited the state on Saturday. following a request made by Gujarat’s chief minister Vijay Rupani to the Centre. The AIIMS director interacted with government and private doctors in the state and also spoke to health care workers at the frontline of the fight against the disease, the Gujarat government said in a statement. “People do not need to be afraid of it (Covid), but precautions are a must. One should consult a doctor as soon as they notice any symptom of Covid-19. Elders and patients with co-morbid conditions could be in trouble if there is delay in reporting the symptoms,” Guleria said.He said that it is difficult to win this battle without public awareness and co-operation, adding that social distancing and protective measures are essential.The statement said that additional chief secretary, Pankaj Kumar and other officers on Covid -19 duty across the state had extensive discussions with Dr Guleria. Of the 394 cases on Saturday, the most are from Ahmedabad, 280, followed by Surat, 30, and Vadodra, 27. Out of 23 deaths, 20 were reported from Ahmedabad and one each from Banaskantha, Jamnagar and Panchamahal.Jayanti Ravi, principal secretary (health) said the least number of deaths in the past week was reported on Saturday. “The recovery rate in past 15 days has improved by 450%. So far, 2019 people have been discharged,” she said.Flights from Singapore, Philippines, USA, U.K, and Kuwait , carrying a total of 1099 people, will land in a phase wise manner at Ahmedabad airport from 10th May, 2020 . “All the passengers will undergo thermal screening and necessary medical checkup followed by institutional quarantine,” said Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aiims-director-visits-gujarat-on-cm-request/story-IPLYS8ZnjZJrI7EjiLXSOP.html
10-05-2020||India||ICMR will develop indigenous vaccine to treat Covid-19||India has taken the first step in developing the first make-in-India vaccine against coronavirus disease (Covid-19), with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and Bharat Biotech partnering to develop a vaccine candidate, the research body announced on Saturday.“ ICMR and Bharat Biotech International Limited (BBIL) have partnered to develop a fully indigenous vaccine for COVID-19 using the virus strain isolated at ICMR’s National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune,” the apex research body said in a statement.“ ICMR has shared one of the 11 virus strains that it managed to culture with Bharat Biotech. The industry partnership is to develop the vaccine candidate and ICMR has transferred the technology to them,” explained Dr Raman R Gangakhedkar, head, department of epidemiology and communicable disease, ICMR.  ICMR’s apex laboratory, NIV, managed to isolate the virus as early as February, using the swab samples of the initial Covid-19 positive cases reported from the state of Kerala.Coronavirus is a difficult virus to isolate; however, scientists at NIV managed to isolate and culture 11 strains -- the basic requirement to develop a vaccine in future or any research related to the viruses.One of the strains has now been successfully transferred from NIV to Bharat Biotech International Ltd. (BBIL) in Hyderabad as part of the partnership.“The work on vaccine development has been initiated between the two partners. ICMR-NIV will provide continuous support to BBIL for vaccine development. ICMR and BBIL will seek fast-track approvals to expedite vaccine development, subsequent animal studies and clinical evaluation of the candidate vaccine,” said the ICMR statement.Dr Krishna Ella, chairman and managing director, Bharat Biotech, confirmed the development.“We are very proud to participate in this project of national importance with ICMR and NIV. We will do everything to make this programme successful in our endeavour to combat Covid-19 pandemic. We also take pride being the only company in the developing world having Biosafety Level 3 production manufacturing facility,” he said.Bharat Biotech announced early last month that it was working on a unique intranasal vaccine for Coronavirus ‘CoroFlu’ in collaboration with the University of Wisconsin–Madison and the vaccine companies FluGen in the US.It will take a few months before the vaccine candidate is ready.“It normally takes about two-three months for the vaccine candidate to be ready, and then different studies are undertaken to test the vaccine candidate,” said Dr Gangakhedkar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/icmr-will-develop-indigenous-vaccine/story-SmYIh29JA5Rldejh7mMjpI.html

His son, Amit Jogi, said his father had suffered cardiac arrest.According to a health bulletin released by the hospital, Jogi was given cardiopulmonary resuscitation at his residence before he was taken to the hospital.“Jogi suffered a cardiac arrest at his house. As of now, his ECG [electrocardiogram] and pulse have returned to normal which means his heartbeats are returning to normal functioning. But his respiration is still not normal. He is on a ventilator and his condition is critical,” it said.Chief minister Bhupesh Baghel spoke to Amit Jogi over the phone about his father’s health and assured him the state government will take every possible step to ensure his treatment, an official statement said.A bureaucrat-turned politician, Ajit Jogi served as the first chief minister of Chhattisgarh from November 2000 to November 2003 after the formation of the state.Ajit Jogi parted ways with the Congress in 2016 after he and Amit Jogi were involved in a controversy over the alleged fixing of a by-election (2014) held to the Antagarh seat in Kanker district. Subsequently, he formed the Janata Congress Chhattisgarh (J).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ajit-jogi-on-ventilator-after-cardiac-arrest/story-2gESSnPid2nTn3IcG6qzUO.html
10-05-2020||India||CBSE set to begin evaluating papers||The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) will set rolling the process of evaluation of Class X and Class XII board examination answer sheets on Sunday; the ministry of home affairs has approved a human resource development (HRD) ministry proposal to this effect.Answer sheets will be moved from 3,000 designated schools to the residences of qualified evaluators who will mark them from their homes. The process is expected to be completed in 50 days.With nearly 1.8 million students awaiting their Class X results and 1.2 million awaiting their class 12 results, the CBSE has been pushing for government permission to carry out the evaluation process, stuck because of the Covid-19 lockdown.HRD minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank said permission had been granted for evaluation in 3,000 schools. He expressed hope that 15 million answer sheets in 173 subjects would be evaluated soon. “From these 3,000 schools these copies will go the evaluators and evaluation will begin tomorrow. Teachers will evaluate from home and we will be able to complete the process in 50 days,” he said. According to a government official who requested anonymity, permission has been granted for the evaluation to take place in all areas except containment zones.The CBSE will now formulate a detailed plan according to which the evaluation will have to be conducted while maintaining social distancing norms. Teachers have traditionally marked the answer sheets in evaluation centres, but this time, keeping in mind the pandemic and lockdown, the work if being done at the homes of evaluators.On Friday, the HRD ministry had cleared the way for holding the pending CBSE Class X and XII board exams. These will be held from July 1 to July 15, the HRD ministry said.While exams for 12 subjects of class 12 will be held across the country, the exams for class 10 will be held only in north-east Delhi, where some of the tests could not be held earlier because of communal violence in the area in February. Overall the CBSE would conduct 29 exams.Given the situation, it is not an easy task and even HRD and CBSE officials admit that the decision will be reviewed in case the situation is not conducive. Randeep Guleria, the director of All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), recently said that the Covid-19 pandemic in the country may not have peaked yet.“According to modelling data and the way our cases are increasing, it is likely that peak can come in June and July. But there are many variables..,” Guleria said.Government officials said while the hope was that the exams will be conducted, the capacity and preparedness will be reviewed in light of the existing circumstances.“A lot of work needs to be done regarding norms as to how students will come to exam centres, the seating arrangement etc. CBSE will bring out certain directions from time to time in this regard. School managements will also have to do their part so that social distancing takes place,” said a senior CBSE official who requested anonymity.The HRD ministry has already announced that the JEE (Main) will be conducted from July 18 to 23 and the National Eligibility and Entrance Test, from July 26.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbse-set-to-begin-evaluating-papers/story-cKwAIRnln2bV3ejLgGbNTJ.html
10-05-2020||India||ED attaches part of building worth Rs 6.38 crore in AJL case||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Saturday partly attached a nine-storey building in Mumbai’s Bandra worth Rs 16.38 crore in connection with an investigation involving Associated Journals Limited (AJL), publisher of National Herald newspaper and controlled by the Gandhi family.The ED said it had attached a part of the building that has been established as “proceeds of crime” and that notices on the action taken under Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) had been issued to AJL and veteran Congress leader, Motilal Vora, chairman and managing director of the company.The nine-storey building, located on plot number 2, Survey number 341, near Kala Nagar in Bandra (East), has two basements and a total built-up area of 15,000 square metres; its total value is around Rs 120 crore.Former Haryana chief minister, Bhupinder Singh Hooda, is named as an accused in the case and both the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and ED chargesheeted him in 2018 and 2019, respectively, along with Vora.Senior Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi said, “This is a part of the continuing governmental tirade against National Herald. Since the primary allegations against National Herald are baseless, such attachment orders are equally baseless and untenable. They will be suitably challenged by proper legal recourse. There is also a continuing process of spread of misinformation by authorities in this regard. Government would be far better advised to use its energies to battle Covid instead of such wasteful exercises of energy.”The ED has alleged that AJL pledged a plot, number C-17, Sector 6, Panchkula, Haryana, which was allegedly allotted illegally to it, to avail a loan from the Syndicate Bank branch on Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg in Delhi to construct the building in Bandra.“Thus, the said asset at Mumbai that germinated out of the proceeds of crime has been attached to the extent of Rs 16.38 crore. Further investigation is going on,” the agency said in a statement. The Panchkula plot has already been attached by the agency.The money laundering probe was based on allegations that the property was allotted to AJL in1982 but was taken back by the Estate Officer, Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA), a decade later, on October 30, 1992 because AJL did not comply with the conditions of the allotment.“However, Hooda blatantly misused his official position and dishonestly allotted the said plot afresh in the guise of reallotment to the AJL at original rates plus interest in violation of necessary conditions and policy of HUDA by an order of August 28, 2005 for Rs 59,39,200,” ED has claimed. The actual value of the property (Panchkula) is about Rs 64.93 crore, it said.The anti-money laundering probe agency has further stated that Hooda, as the then Haryana CM, caused a wrongful loss to HUDA, and wrongful gain to AJL, by ignoring legal opinion and recommendations of HUDA officers and financial commissioner and principal secretary, Town and Country Planning.Senior Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi said, “This is a part of the continuing governmental tirade against National Herald. Since the primary allegations against National Herald are baseless, such attachment orders are equally baseless and untenable. They will be suitably challenged by proper legal recourse. There is also a continuing process of spread of misinformation by authorities in this regard.

10-05-2020||India||Villagers demand Vizag unit closure after Styrene gas leak killed 12||The Andhra Pradesh government on Saturday announced a door-to-door survey in all villages close to LG Polymers India Limited to identify residents exposed to the leak of Styrene gas near this coastal city that claimed 12 lives, as hundreds of villagers staged a sit-in protest with bodies of the victims at the plant, demanding its immediate closure.LG Polymers, a unit of the Korean conglomerate  offered an apology to the people affected by the gas leak and condolences to the families of the dead and said normalcy had been restored at the plant .“We would like to assure everyone that the company is committed to work closely with the concerned authorities in India to investigate the cause of this incident, prevent recurrence in the future, and secure the foundation for care and treatment,” a statement by the company said.State industries minister Mekapati Gautam Reddy said situation at the plant was under control and normalcy would return to Visakhapatnam in 48 hours. “We shall conduct door-to-door survey soon to identify the affected people and extend all possible to help to them. There is no need for the people to get panicky,” he said.In the morning, tension prevailed at the LG Polymers plant in R R Venkatapuram village, where hundreds of people belonging to the surrounding villages staged a sit-in protest demanding the immediate closure of the plant.Several men and women tried to barge into the plant’s premises even as state director general of police Gautam Sawang was inspecting the storage tank from where the leak took place. “We want justice,” chanted the protestors.“Close down the company.”The villagers stopped ambulances carrying the bodies of three of the victims from King George Hospital mortuary to their villages for cremation after a post-mortem examination and kept the bodies on the road in front the company’s gates.The protestors tried to gherao Sawang as he emerged from the plant. A distraught woman protester fell on his feet, but she was pushed away by women constables. Sawang was escorted out of the premises by the police.“It has been two days since the cases were filed against the management of LG Polymers. But no action has been taken against any of the company officials till date. We shall not allow the company to run under any circumstances,” an angry villager told reporters.The police resorted to a lathi charge to disperse the protestors. They bundled scores of protesters into vans and took them away to the Gopalapatnam police station. Many others assembled at the spot and gatecrashed into the premises.Visakhapatnam police commissioner R K Meena intervened and with the help of additional forces, managed to force the protestors out of the premises. The police managed to shift the bodies from the spot to Venkatapuram village for cremation.State minister for tourism M Srinivasa Rao and other ruling YSR Congress Party leaders tried to soothe the angry villagers saying the government would make efforts to see that LG Polymers shifts from the location.“The government has appointed a high-powered committee which would go deep into the mishap and take stern action against the company. Please bear with us,” Srinivasa Rao appealed to the villagers with folded hands.Sawang told reporters the situation was under control. He said more technical teams from Delhi would be arriving later in the day to study the situation and suggest the way forward.Sawang, who had a meeting with technical experts, scientists and a special team from the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), appealed to the people not to rush back to their villages but remain in relief camps for another 48 hours, which was mandatory period to restore normalcy as per the safety protocol.He said the high-powered committee would take up the investigation soon and based on its report, action would be initiated against the company. “There is no need for us to protect anybody. Depending on the progress of the case, we shall invoke more sections of the Indian Penal Code against the company,” he said.In a statement, LG Polymers said initial investigations suggested that the cause of the incident on Thursday was a leakage of vapour from the Styrene Monomer storage tank.The statement said that while focusing on stabilizing the plant, the company was doing its best to extend support to ensure those who had been exposed to the leak were taken care of.A special task force has been formed to help the victims, which would contact all the families shortly and provide medical care and emotional and psychological counselling, the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/villagers-demand-vizag-unit-closure/story-qU7PwICTH7m4Snm0qkbpBP.html
10-05-2020||India||In Bengal, man recovers from Covid-19 after 38 days on ventilator||Nitaidas Mukherjee, a resident of south Kolkata, may well be one among the over 17,800 persons cured of Covid-19 till date in the country, but his doctors term his recovery a miracle. The 52-year-old was kept on a ventilator for 38 days before he returned home on Friday, free of the coronavirus. Doctors at AMRI in Dhakuria where Mukherjee was admitted, said that it was a remarkable feat, as a Covid-19 patient on a ventilator is not considered to have a high chance of survival.“This is my second life you can say. Without the doctors I would have been dead by now. They are the actual heroes,” Mukherjee, who is still frail and felt too weak to speak over phone, said.Mukherjee first began to exhibit symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection in mid-March. Having suffered a bout of pneumonia in 2017, his family comprising his wife, Aparajita, his 75-year-old mother and septuagenarian aunt thought that his bouts of cough were par for the course. However, it’s when he developed fever that his family decided to have him tested for Covid-19. One of the guidelines for testing issued by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) at the time was that a person could only be tested if they had travelled abroad. “We didn’t have any travel history. But as the symptoms were similar to that of Covid-19, so we decided to take him to a private hospital on March 29. As his condition deteriorated he was put on ventilator the same night. The next day his test results came positive and his battle with death started,” said Aparajita (39).As his condition worsened doctors performed a procedure called tracheostomy, which involves making an incision in the throat to open a direct airway to the trachea for ease of breathing.Coronavirus disease is a type of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Normally, ARDS is something that happens over time, but with Sars-Cov-2, it’s faster: the lungs get inflamed, and fluid leaks into the alveoli. Doctors typically put patients on ventilators to help them re-oxygenate the bloodstream. In a worst case scenario, a “cytokine storm” is possible: that’s when the body’s white blood cells and other antibodies, produced to fight the viral infection, end up attacking the body’s own cells. “Doctors had told me that his condition was extremely precarious. But they never lost hope and continued to fight. I was not sure whether I would be able to see him anymore and prayed to God. He is a social worker and runs a NGO. I believe the prayers of all those he had helped in the past worked and helped him to survive,”A statement issued by AMRI hospital on Friday said: “[Mukherjee] has created a record of sorts in India by being the first patient of COVID-19, to have defeated the virus despite being on ventilator for 38 days.”“This is indeed a remarkable feat. Staying on ventilation and then returning home is something uncommon,” said Sukumar Mukherjee, one of the doctors in the advisory panel set up chief minister Mamata Banerjee to tackle the state’s response to the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-bengal-man-recovers-after-38-days-on-ventilator/story-oN6YwSX9KnFPu3wUKR7FbP.html
10-05-2020||India||Rural housing schemes key for MGNREGS success amid Covid-19 lockdown||The Centre’s flagship housing scheme for the rural poor is likely to be key to the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS)’s success this year amid a surge in demand for jobs as millions of migrant workers left jobless by the Covid-19 lockdown in big cities have returned home.Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana (Gramin), or PMAY (G), the housing scheme, employed 51% of MGNREGS job seekers last year, according to official data. There has been much focus on the PMAY (G) in view of the social distancing required to check the Covid-19 spread. Hardly 3-4 workers are required to build a rural, concrete house for the poor in comparison to works like road constructions undertaken under the MGREGS, which require hundreds of workers. A Union rural development ministry note last month told states and Union territories that “maximum sanctions to beneficiaries [under PMAY (G)] be issued against the 2020-21 targets” and underlined the urgency of creating more jobs. The note added that “not exceeding 2-3 workers, excluding the beneficiary [of a house] may be engaged in house construction”.The Centre plans to construct 6.15 million houses for the rural poor under the PMAY (G) this financial year. Madhya Pradesh has been allotted the highest quota of 1.06 million houses under the scheme followed by West Bengal’s 920,000 and Bihar 806,000’s. Until Saturday, 116.5 million workers were active under the MGNREGS, according to the official data. The Centre has set an initial target of creating 2800 million person-days of work—the highest ever—under the flagship scheme for 2020-21 amid rising unemployment due to the Covid-19 pandemic. It is 40 million higher than the previous year. The MGNREGS last year generated 2767.6 million person-days of work.The Centre has allotted Rs 19,500 crore for the housing scheme and Rs 61,500 crore for the MGNREGS, which provides at least 100 days of employment annually to at least one member of every rural household.Union rural development minister Narendra Singh Tomar said the government is aware that more people might need jobs under the MGNREGS as millions of migrant labourers have returned to their homes. “We have already approved Rs 33,300 crore under the MGNREGS for the states out of which Rs 20,752 crore has been released, liquidating all pending liabilities on wages and material. There is no pending bill on account of wages,” he said.The Centre’s added emphasis on the rural housing scheme is also a reflection of its inability to complete its target last year. In 2019-20, the Centre has targeted building 6 million houses but only managed to allot 4.47 million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/housing-schemes-key-for-mgregs/story-YpoSoZitKXQkl5T9SAThhL.html
10-05-2020||India||Privatise MGNREGS to revive aggregate demand||The impact of the ongoing lockdown is evident in the manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index number for April that came out on Monday (a contraction after 32 months of expansion; and the lowest since the index began, 27.4). Data on GST collections aren’t out — businesses have been given time till May 5 to pay their GST — but CNBC TV18 reported that Goods and Services Tax (GST) collections for the month of March, recorded in April are likely to have fallen to less than Rs 30,000 crore. In normal times, these figures have been around Rs 90,000-1,00,000 crore. This means that economic activity has reduced to less than a third of its normal levels.Bringing the economy back on track is going to take a concerted policy effort and will require shedding entrenched orthodoxy such insisting on fiscal prudence. At the same time, resources will have to be employed in an intelligent manner.Five factors need to be kept in mind while devising such a strategy. One, unlike disruptions such as war or natural disasters, there has not been any physical destruction of capacity in this crisis. This rules out a reconstruction led path to exit the crisis. Such a strategy was key to overcoming the Great Depression in Europe after the Second World War.Two, large parts of the private sector have accumulated heavy losses due to loss of business activity. They will continue to face bearish prospects. This is because a sharp drop in economic activity has adversely affected mass demand. Any short-term aid without a sustained revival in mass demand is likely to fail. Three, even if the government were to shed fiscal conservatism, money will be tight because of loss in revenue due to fall in economic activity levels. Four, the lockdown has triggered a huge reverse migration to India’s villages. Even if the lockdown is lifted, the workers are not likely to come back anytime soon, thanks to the trauma and uncertainty they have faced in the past forty days. This means they will continue to suffer a loss in incomes, which will translate into weak demand . Five, even before the pandemic hit, the Indian economy was not in a very good shape. Economic sentiment, as captured in the RBI’s Consumer Confidence Surveys, had plummeted to an all-time low. So, how should we go about reviving aggregate demand? Export markets are unlikely to help in the short to medium term. Everybody has been hit. And there is no ruling out another outbreak of the virus, which will only make matters worse. Any recovery strategy must be inward looking. Here’s one way in which it can be done.Food accounts for almost 40% of the average Indian household’s consumption basket. This is pretty high by international standards. Data from the United States Department of Agriculture shows that share of food consumed at home had a share of 29.1% in consumer expenditure in India. In a list of 104 countries, India was ranked 34th on this aspect. The centrality of food spending in household budgets has emerged a major fault line in economic policy making in India. Efforts to keep food prices low to protect the poor have put a squeeze on farm incomes. Spikes in food prices, on the other hand, especially in an environment of tepid income growth, hurt non-food demand. The current crisis provides an opportunity to resolve this dilemma. Because villages will have a glut of labour supply due to reverse migration, rural wages are bound to go down sharply. Hired labour is an important cost component of agricultural production in India. For a crop such as paddy, it accounts for as much as 25% of the A2+FL cost measure, which takes into account the following: value of agricultural inputs such as seeds and fertilizers; hired human, animal and machine labour; land revenue and irrigation charges; depreciation of farm implements and buildings; interest on working capital; rent paid for leased in land; and imputed value of family labour. The current government has been using the A2+FL measure to justify its Minimum Support Prices (MSP) providing a return of 50% over the cost of production. This is as high as 30% in the case of important vegetables such as potatoes and onions. While the share is low for a crop like wheat, labour saving techniques have imposed their own costs such as pollution due to stubble burning in northern states. (See Chart 3)What if the government decided to allow employment of MGNREGS workers in private agricultural activity? This will lead to a significant reduction in cost of cultivation by easing or even eradicating the cost of hired labour. A suitable mechanism can be worked out to ensure that farmers who avail this arrangement pass on their savings in terms of lower prices in both public procurement and private markets. Once the logistics have been worked out, there will be multiple benefits for such a policy. MGNREGS will see a significant enhancement in its employment capacity. The government could gain from this arrangement by saving in terms of procurement expenditure. The most important benefits of this will be outside the agriculture sector though. A possible reduction in food prices will free large parts of household budgets for buying things from the non-food economy. Even if nominal wages fall as firms try and compensate for losses and tepid economic activity, low food prices without hurting farm incomes can be an effective way of boosting real incomes of the masses in India. India spent Rs 71,000 crore on MGNREGS in 2019-2020.

As of May 7, Pune has registered a total of 137 deaths due to Covid-19 and 2,245 positive cases.Though the containment zones in Bhavani Peth and Dhole Patil Road wards continue to show the highest number of Covid-19 positive cases in the city, the flattening of the curve was clearly visible in the containment clusters of two other wards in the city, namely Shivajinagar-Ghole Road and Kasba Vishrambaugwada.As of May 6, the containment clusters in Bhawani Peth ward had 451 positive cases, followed by Dhole Patil Road (347), Shivajinagar-Ghole Road (247), Yerawada-Kalas-Dhanori (236) and Kasba-Vishrambaugwada (172).On May 7, Pune’s Additional Municipal Commissioner Rubal Agarwal noted that the recovery and discharge of Covid-19 patients was on the rise from around 27 patients on April 28 and 29, to 50-55 from May 1 to May 6.The mortality rate for Pune had also dropped from a high of 9 percent to 5.8 percent as of May 7 and the doubling of positive cases had increased to 12 days in Pune, she said. Agarwal attributed this positive trend to early detection of positive cases and increased testing.“Micro-containment and aggressive reaching out has been happening and in the last two days the number of tests has almost doubled to 1,600 per day,” said data analyst Sahil Deo, whose team at CPC Analytics has been tracking Covid-19 trends at the ward level on a daily basis with data provided by the PMC.He noted that yet another important indicator was the ratio of recoveries to new cases which stood at 61% for Pune as of May 8 as against 21% for Mumbai and 15% for Maharashtra.“61% is not an anomaly because it has constantly been around 50% for the last 5-6 days. This shows that recovery is also happening in a significant way,” he said. For every 10 new cases, 6 to 7 patients had shown a recovery over the last three days,” Deo said.The slowdown that was visible in the containment clusters of Shivajinagar and Kasba wards was not seen in the containment areas of Bhavani Peth and Dhole Patil Road wards which continue to be the worst affected localities in Pune.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-two-of-five-worst-hit-clusters-in-pune-show-flattening-of-curve/story-6UxqLgNMeoSqUfvKQDCpgN.html

10-05-2020||Editorials||Be more transparent about the PM-Cares fund||In the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, the government created the Prime Minister’s Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations (PM-Cares) Fund. While questions have been asked about its need when the PM’s National Relief Fund already exists, the government is entitled to come up with institutional innovations for special situations.The PM-Cares fund has received substantial contributions. There has, however, been a lack of transparency. The government has not made public the amount of donation received by the fund. It has also not yet outlined the composition of the board of trustees, which, besides the PM and three top ministers (defence, home and finance), is meant to include three eminent persons. The government has also not clarified if the fund is already being used, and if so, for what purpose. This is surprising because it is clear that India is under great fiscal stress, and the objectives of the fund include “creation and upgradation of health care or pharmaceutical facilities, other necessary infrastructure, funding relevant research and other types of support”. They also include rendering financial assistance, providing grants of payments of money and taking “any such steps as may be deemed necessary by the Board of Trustees” for the affected population. India responded to the PM’s call for support to the fund. It is now the government’s turn to tell citizens what is being done with it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/be-more-transparent-about-the-pm-cares-fund/story-2U6a5QJTacVZcuOj81U5PL.html
10-05-2020||Editorials||Securing the Aarogya Setu app||The Aarogya Setu application was born out of a need to bring a 21st century technology-based solution to an unprecedented problem. India is not alone in deciding to leverage the ubiquitous smartphone for tracking outbreaks, a strategy that fundamentally involves a compromise with privacy. But it is the only democracy which has, without the requisite legal architecture in place, made the app almost mandatory for mobility and to resume work. This compromise is evidence of how the Sars-Cov-2 has upended conventional disease containment efforts, with a higher degree of government supervision, and even control, over the lives of citizens than usual. But it is crucial that this necessity does not lead to a lasting change in how we approach privacy. By design, the app goes a step further than most such tools developed around the world. It tracks where people have been, instead of merely determining who they were in close contact with. While such functionality can theoretically help identify disease hotspots, it will need to be corroborated with the exactness of physical contact tracing.The other concern stems from the nature of computer programmes. They are prone to vulnerabilities, particularly in early iterations. This was proved by a French programmer who demonstrated the possibility of accessing parts of the Aarogya Setu app that store a person’s contact records. Common cybersecurity and hacking techniques have proven capable of reverse engineering such data to dig out information that was meant to be hidden. What the researcher demonstrated was the penultimate step before someone can be traced without the need to break into a government database. An increasing number of countries are discovering flaws — in design or code — and are going back to the drawing board. The United Kingdom’s National Health Service is considering abandoning its version of a centralised contact-tracing app, where data is sent to government servers, to switch to the decentralised platform being developed by Apple and Google, where data is matched on phones.As the approaches around such tools evolve, India must look at the experiences and experiments in other countries. One of the main demands by privacy as well as cyber security experts around the world is to throw open the code behind these contact-tracing applications so that they can be audited for design and programming flaws. At the very least, the developers of Aarogya Setu must consider doing this, since it will not only be a step toward transparency but also help quash bugs. After all, the current gold standard of such tools, Singapore’s Trace Together, is an open-source programme. Beyond this, India must seriously contemplate a legal design around the app, which strikes a balance between disease containment and privacy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/securing-the-aarogya-setu-app/story-A3lGwuWgqJVvtwEoM9FNSM.html
