11-05-2020||News||India will have to contest charges of religious bias||There is disquiet in some sections in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), among other Islamic countries, that parts of Indian society and polity are exhibiting signs of Islamophobia, especially manifest after the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. Prime Minister Narendra Modi tried to counter this sentiment. In a tweet on April 19, Modi emphasised the need for unity and brotherhood in combating the virus for it targets all. He was conveying that it was wrong to hold all Muslims responsible for the actions of the Tablighi Jamaat. The same view was expressed more directly by a senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) office-bearer in these pages.As in the past, this year too, Modi extended Ramzan greetings. He tweeted, “May this Holy Month bring with it abundance of kindness, harmony and compassion”. Two years ago, Modi recalled Prophet Mohammad’s message of equality, brotherhood and the value of charity. And in an address to the World Sufi Forum in 2016, Modi spoke of the “rich diversity of the Islamic civilisation that stands on the solid bedrock of a great religion”. In the same speech, he said, “It is this spirit of Sufism, the love for their country and the pride in their nation that define the Muslims in India. They reflect the timeless culture of peace, diversity and equality of faith of our land…” These stirring words reflect neither Islamophobia nor a bias against Muslims. Why is it then that sections of the Islamic ummah are troubled by India’s emerging orientations? This was not witnessed during Modi’s first term when, building on past policies, he strengthened relations with mutually-antagonistic West Asian nations. Hence, the Modi 2.0 government’s policies and actions that impact or are perceived to impact on India’s Muslims have to be examined. It must also be examined how Pakistan has sought to exploit these issues. Four developments stand out: The constitutional changes in Jammu and Kashmir, the Citizenship (Amendment) Act or CAA and fear of Muslims that it would be the precursor to the National Register of Citizens (NRC), the Delhi riots, and the reaction to the Tablighi Jamaat congregation.The constitutional changes in Jammu and Kashmir were looked upon in the peninsular Arab countries as political and within India’s domestic jurisdiction. Pakistan’s accusations of India violating international law, United Nations resolutions, seeking to change the demographic structure of the Valley and disregarding human rights found no traction. Its diatribe against the Modi government and its ideological Hindutva roots was also ignored.The exclusion of Muslims from CAA was premised on the consideration that the Pakistani, Bangladeshi and Afghan polities being theocratic are inherently discriminatory and sometimes persecutorial. The Modi government correctly asserted that the CAA did not impact Indian Muslims. However, large numbers of Muslims were alarmed because they felt that it was the precursor of NRC, which could make many of them stateless. The long agitations which followed were noticed in the Muslim world, including the Gulf countries. While international liberal opinion was further alienated because of religion becoming a factor in granting nationality, despite Pakistan’s best efforts, the Gulf countries did not become hostile. However, Malaysia and Turkey did.The Delhi riots and, in some cases, the inflammatory reactions to the Tablighi Jamaat’s actions which contributed to the spread of Covid-19 soured sections of Gulf opinion. This was on account of reports in the international media that Muslims were particularly and violently targeted. Some reprehensible comments made against Muslims in general in the wake of the Tablighi Jamaat’s conduct, and some irresponsible demands that Muslims be boycotted, caused dismay and anger among some in the Gulf. This was heightened by the objectionable social media comments of a few Indian expatriates living in Gulf countries. This somewhat fertile setting has given Pakistan the opportunity to fan anti-Indian flames through bogus social media accounts and also by dredging up its entire litany of charges against the Modi government. Its current specific endeavour is to make the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) pass strictures, at a high level, against India for officially encouraging Islamophobia. A few days ago, in a four-page note to OIC countries, it stressed that the BJP rose to power on the “central plank” of “hatred for Muslims” and has fostered it thereafter. Clearly, these charges of Islamophobia have to be challenged and combatted. It is true that Islamic countries as theological polities are basically discriminatory. They are also not condemning China’s oppression of its Uighur Muslims. Making these points may work in a school debate but not in the world of diplomacy, which, in any event, is not about scoring points but securing national interest. What is necessary, without being on the defensive, is to assure Islamic nations that India is not moving away from its constitutional moorings by ensuring harmony and effective action against those who disturb it irrespective of their party affiliations. It is also necessary not to show disdain for global liberal opinion, but to engage with it.Vivek Katju is a former diplomatThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/india-will-have-to-contest-charges-of-religious-bias/story-gDHSpCdnQq4hFeC8yRYV2N.html

11-05-2020||Delhi||SC orders setting up of panel headed by MHA secy to consider pleas seeking 4G in J&K||The Supreme Court on Monday ordered setting up of a “special committee” headed by Union home secretary to consider pleas for restoration 4G internet services in Jammu and Kashmir, saying that the national security and human rights needed to be balanced in view of the fact the Union Territory has been “plagued with militancy”.The top court said it was desirable to have better internet services in the UT in view of the worldwide pandemic and a national lockdown.“However, the fact that outside forces are trying to infiltrate the borders and destabilise the integrity of the nation, as well as cause incidents resulting in the death of innocent citizens and security forces every day cannot be ignored,” said the bench comprising Justices N V Ramana, R Subhash Reddy and B R Gavai.The top court said it takes “with utmost seriousness” the sensitive task of balancing “national security and human rights” and referred to its earlier judgement in which it held that “the degree of restriction and the scope of the same, both territorially and temporally, must stand in relation to what is actually necessary to combat an emergent situation.” “At the same time, we do recognise that the Union Territory has been plagued with militancy, which is required to be taken into consideration. These competing considerations needs to calibrated in terms of our judgment …,” Justice Ramana, who wrote the order for the bench, said.The bench said since the issues involved affected both the Union Territory and the nation, the review committee should comprise their senior officials to look into the entire issue.“We, therefore, find it appropriate to constitute a special committee comprising the following secretaries at national, as well as state level, to look into the prevailing circumstances and immediately determine the necessity of the continuation of the restrictions in Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir,” the order said.The ministry of home affairs (MHA) secretary will head the special panel and the secretary of ministry of communications and the chief secretary of the Union Territory would be the members.“The special committee is directed to examine the contentions of, and the material placed herein by, the petitioners as well as the respondents. The Committee must also examine the appropriateness of the alternatives suggested by the petitioners, regarding limiting the restrictions to those areas where it is necessary and the allowing of faster internet (3G or 4G) on a trial basis over certain geographical areas and advise the respondent no. 1 (Centre) regarding the same, in terms of our earlier directions,” it said.The court took note of the submissions of the Centre that continuous infiltration, foreign influence, violent extremism and issues of national integrity are prevalent in the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir, which are serious issues. The Centre had also pointed to certain material, which indicate that cyber terrorism, is on the rise within the valley and the Pakistani Military in its “Green Book 2020” has called for an information warfare on Kashmir, after the revocation of special status of Jammu and Kashmir, the order noted. The apex court directions came on pleas filed by Foundation for Media Professionals, Soayib Qureshi and Private Schools Association of Jammu and Kashmir seeking restoration of 4G in the UT on grounds such as right to access doctors is an inherent under article 21 (right to life) of the Constitution and it’s deprivation should be judged in view of the coronavirus or Covid-19 pandemic. They had also alleged that the right of children to access schools through the high speed internet service have been hampered. Earlier, the Centre and the Jammu and Kashmir administration, had justified the restriction on 4G service in the Union Territory saying high speed internet might be used for sending information about troop movement, and referred to the recent “tragic” deaths of security personnel in an encounter with terrorists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sc-orders-setting-up-of-panel-headed-by-mha-secy-to-consider-pleas-seeking-4g-in-j-k/story-k4DEMdwlza6vk6JIlJ3SKK.html

However, the difference was barely marginal in 2017 and 2018 when rates went down from 21 to 20, respectively.In 2018, infant mortality rate in rural areas at 21 was higher than that of urban areas at 19. In all, from 26 cases in 2013, the IMR rate went down to 24 in 2014, 23 in 2015 and 21 in 2016. In comparison, Haryana recorded 30 deaths per 1,000 births in 2018.

In Haryana it was lower at 5.9 (2018).On the other hand, birth rates in Punjab were 14.8 against Haryana’s 20.3. The national birth average was 20 per 1,000 (2018). Commenting on the report, Dr Avneet Kaur, director health and family welfare department, said, “We have been successful in reducing the infant mortality rate because we have strengthened our labour room quality programme called Lakshya, fitting all parameters of this programme for better care of mothers and their newborn babies.”“In Punjab, the infant mortality rate is higher in the first four weeks of pregnancy. Therefore, sick newborn care units have been established in every district, all of which are functional now. We have also focused on a care companion programme in which we educate caretakers of infants on how to take better care of them,” she said.HOW THE STATES FAREDInfant Mortality Rate/1,000 populationIndia: 32Punjab: 20Haryana: 30Overall birth and death rate/1,000 populationIndia 6.2Punjab 6.6Haryana 5.9Birth RateIndia 20Punjab 14.8Haryana 20.3||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/infant-mortality-rate-down-23-in-punjab-in-five-years/story-vBagpkvEZbIBfc8DoMmBZP.html
11-05-2020||Lucknow||Women give birth on special trains for migrants||The joy of finally getting back home after remaining stuck without work for over a month due to the nationwide lockdown turned into a moment of bliss for two women migrant workers when they gave birth to healthy kids onboard the trains in which they were travelling on Sunday.Mamta Yadav, 35, had decided to be with her mother in Manoharpur village of Chapra district in Bihar after her husband, a factory worker in Jamnagarin Gujarat, was rendered jobless due to the lockdown. Though being in an advanced stage of pregnancy she decided to board the Jamnagar-Muzaffarpur Shramik express on the first opportunity after the Centre and state governments decided to allow movement of migrants. “My husband Suresh Yadav decided to stay back in the hope that the factories may resume work shortly and he would get work. But I wanted to be with my mother. On Sunday around midnight I started having severe pain in my abdomen. Seeing my condition some co-passengers informed the ticket collector,” she said over phone.The train was about a couple of hours away from its next stoppage at Agra Fort. The railway staff alerted the station manager about the situation. A team of doctors along with railway staff was kept on alert. As soon as the special train reached Agra Fort station at 4:43 am the passengers were asked to move to other compartments as the coach in which Yadav was travelling was converted into a labour room.“Then a team of doctors supervised the delivery. Both the baby girl and the woman are healthy and safe. They were allowed to move on. The train left at 6:08am,” said S K Srivastav, divisional commercial manager of Agra division.A similar story unfolded on board Akbarpur-bound Shramik express. Subhadra, a 30-year-old migrant worker and native of Ambedkar Nagar district, gave birth to a healthy baby boy at Moradabad railway station.Subhadra was with her husband Durgesh and the railway officials said the couple had boarded the train from Jalandhar station. Rekha Sharma, senior divisional commercial manager (SDCM) of Northern Railways, Moradabad division, said “The railway protection force (RPF) deployed in Shramik special train had informed them before the train arrived in Moradabad. It reached at 6:10 am. Our medical team led by Dr Piyush Rana was fully prepared for the task. The team suggested that they stay here at railway hospital, but they just wanted to reach home. Since doctors were satisfied with the health of mother and newborn, they allowed them to go,” the SDCM added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/women-give-birth-on-special-trains-for-migrants/story-wHAK9zaCkWPBGRKJySDxnI.html

11-05-2020||Mumbai||Ratnagiri accident: High court orders crime branch to probe||The Bombay high court (HC) on Friday transferred an accidental death case to the local crime branch of Ratnagiri police after noticing that it could be a murder.“Prima facie, there seems to be some substance in the allegations made by the petitioner,” said justice Revati Mohite-Dere, regarding the death of Sachin Narkar, who his mother Sheela Narkar claimed was murdered.On March 6, the Sagari police station in Ratnagiri district registered an accidental death case after Narkar was found dead in his car. Local police claimed that the car turned turtle and he died in the accident.His mother, however, approached the high court, alleging that her son was murdered and his body was placed in the car to make it look like an accident.She pointed out that though Narkar was purportedly driving the car, his body was found upside down on the back seat. Besides, her lawyer advocate PR Pandey also pointed out that the post-mortem report revealed that the deceased had multiple incised wounds, which could not have happened in the accident.Justice Mohite-Dere also noted some other aspects which created doubts about the accident. “Prima facie, it appears that if the car had turtled in the manner as alleged, the car would have several dents and huge damage,” said the judge. “The photos of the car show none.”Besides, the judge said, the injuries sustained by the deceased were only on the head and neck and there was no fracture of ribs as normally found in motor accident cases.Against this backdrop, the judge thought it appropriate to transfer the investigation to the local crime branch.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ratnagiri-accident-high-court-orders-crime-branch-to-probe/story-uC45aj6217v77BrMlwglnM.html

But, as he had returned from Gurugram, my team on Sunday evening reached his house to paste ‘home quarantined’ poster where we faced opposition from his family members.”“On Monday morning, I came to know that I have been shifted to the anti-malaria unit. The man is politically connected and used his power to remove me from the post of quarantine in-charge,” he claimed. Chief medical officer Dr Yogesh Sharma, however, said, “Ramesh Punia basically works under the district malaria officer. Hisar has no malaria case and we intend to maintain that status. Punia has been asked to control malaria spread in the district.

11-05-2020||Pune||No food, no money, no work, will return when situation normalises, says labourers||There was chaos in a lane near Dandekar bridge on Monday as labourers from nearby areas, who had filled application forms to go to their hometowns, gathered to check if the special police officers called out their names among the list of people who will return home.A group of labourers did not even realise that the list of names being called out was only for trains which will be leaving for Uttar Pradesh. Among them was a group of cloth handiwork - stitching and embroidery - workers from Darbhanga in Bihar. They sat at the end of a 130-150-metre long line waiting for their names to be called out.Mohammad Salauddin Ansari, 42, a native of Darbhanga, who currently lives in the interiors of Dattawadi, said, “I am staying here for the past 10 years, but I have to return as I do not have food or money left.”“Pre-Diwali is the peak season for the business. During this time we get money to survive during the low seasons. Currently, work has come to a standstill. We work for some shops owners and they have shut shops now,” said Ansari.“I will come back if the almighty wants me to come here and I hope this pandemic ends soon,” said Ansari.The workers get paid per piece they stitch or embroider - dupatta, saree, dress, scarf among other cloth items. Among the same group was Mohammad Hashim Shaikh, 27, who had come to the city a year ago and hopes to come back when the pandemic is over.“Ration was distributed in the areas close to the main road. Nobody bothered to come in the interiors of the lanes where we live,” he said before turning his attention back to the public announcement system.While the two workers waited with 25-30 others with them, a family of three waited for their names to be called by the group of special police officers helping the staff of Dattawadi police station.“I have been working at a laundry for a few months now. My wife came here to visit me around January with my 5-year-old daughter. She was scheduled to leave on April 3. Now I will go back with her and wait for the lockdown to be over,” said a well-dressed Pravesh Kumar Sishad, 37, who waited for their names to be called out along with his 30-year-old wife Sushma Devi and their daughter - all wore masks.“Afterwards, I will try to come back. We last got paid in March. No money in April,” he added. They were hoping to make their way to Jaunpur in Uttar Pradesh.While their fate was not shared by others, the sentiment was shared by Shyam Sundar Maurya, 25, who wanted to reach Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh.“I work in a furniture shop. I came here in January. My brother came here, two months before me, in November 2019. We could hardly work for two months before work stopped completely and we had to ask for money from home where nobody is earning,” said Maurya.While Shyam’s name was on the list of applicants approved and returned from Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh, his elder brother’s name was missing.However, Pornima Gaikwad, deputy commissioner of police, zone 3, who was present on the spot assured them that his brother will receive help.“I have 15,000 labourers in my zone. Today (on Monday) 1,310 labourers will be leaving - the first batch from my zone. PMPML is providing buses from verification points to railway stations,” said DCP Gaikwad.“The process is challenging - first registration because of the sheer number of people as against the 30-40 police staff and second was the assessment. All 15,000 people in my zone got medical certificates before it was not a requirement anymore. Now their mobilisation is our task,” said DCP Gaikwad.When asked about the issue faced while dealing with a desperate crowd, DCP Gaikwad said, “They are just poor people wanting to go home after being here without work or money for 45 days.”In zone 3 there were seven other points like the one near Dandekar bridge where labourers had gathered - two managed by Sinhgad road police station, three (including Dandekar bridge) in Dattawadi, one in Kothrud and two in Warje, according to DCP Gaikwad.The ones who made it through the lane and onto the PMPML bus left Pune on a train scheduled to leave Pune station at 8:30 pm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/no-food-no-money-no-work-will-return-when-situation-normalises-says-labourers/story-4W5CwRQKXf2zdexiG5kZzN.html
11-05-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra CM files nomination for legislative council elections||Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray filed his nomination papers for the Maharashtra Legislative Council (MLC) election on Monday. Besides Thackeray, four other candidates of the ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) too filed their nominations for the biennial election of the upper House of the state legislature.Thackeray becomes the first Shiv Sena chief to enter the legislature as he along with others are set to get elected unopposed. He is the second member from the Thackeray family to contest an election after his son and minister Aaditya, who contested assembly polls in October 2019. Thackeray was accompanied by wife Rashmi and sons Aaditya and Tejas while he filed his nomination papers.As Congress decided to withdraw one of its candidates from the upcoming legislative Council polls on Sunday evening, the elections to the nine seats will be unopposed. Thackeray will be elected to the upper House of the state legislature without an election being held.Shiv Sena’s Neelam Gorhe also filed her nomination papers. Gorhe is the deputy chairperson of the legislative Council. Nationalist Congress Party’s (NCP) candidates Amol Mitkari, who is known to be close to Ajit Pawar, filed their nomination papers. Mitkari is the state general secretary of the party who played a vital role in last year’s assembly polls. NCP’s Shashikant Shinde also filed nomination. Congress party fielded Rajesh Rathod; he too filed his nomination papers later in the afternoon.Besides the candidates announced by the four parties, two more candidates from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and NCP, and one Independent also filed nomination today. BJP’s Sandeep Lele and Ramesh Karad, and NCP’s Kiran Pawaskar and Shivajirao Garje along with Rathod Shahbaaz Allauddin, an Independent filed nomination on Monday. However, sources said that these are dummy candidates and would withdraw their nomination by May 14, which is the last day of withdrawal of candidature.“The election will be unopposed. In the end, only nine candidates will remain in the fray. We did not want to engage in any politics, as it is not the time for politicking. The chief minister said that this was a time to tackle the situation and the Congress party responded to his appeal and fielded only one candidate,” said Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut.Senior leaders from the Shiv Sena, Subhash Desai, Eknath Shinde Arvind Sawant, among others were also present with the CM at the Vidhan Bhawan. Deputy chief minister and NCP leader Ajit Pawar, NCP’s Jayant Patil. Congress leaders Ashok Chavan, Balasaheb Thorat and Nitin Raut were also there to lend support.On April 30, the Governor shut the nomination door on Thackeray and requested the Election Commission to hold elections for nine seats to the state legislative council at the earliest to end the political uncertainty in the state.

11-05-2020||Chandigarh||Rural belt of 5 Haryana dists hit harder by virus, health dept worried||As the state continues to grapple with increasing Covid-19 cases, a data assessment has revealed that the rural areas of five Haryana districts — Sonepat, Jind, Rohtak, Dadri and Bhiwani — stand more affected by the contagion than their urban sectors.These districts have witnessed 136 cases till now, out of which their villages make up for 86 (63%) infected patients.As per the data crunched by Hindustan Times, Sonepat has 105 Covid-19 cases, of which 61 pertain to rural areas and 44 to its urban localities. Of Jind’s 17 cases, 15 are from villages and two from the urban part. Rohtak has seen four of its five cases from the villages, while Dadri has reported all three cases from rural areas, and Bhiwani got three cases from villages and three from Vidya Nagar area, which lies in the heart of the city.Sonepat district has the highest number (27) of affected villages in the state. Also, Sonepat and Gurugram each have 91 actives Covid-19 — highest in the state.Going by village-wise data, Khubru in Sonepat is the most affected village with 10 cases, followed by Gayaspur (7), Pubnera (5) and Rasoi (3) villages. In Jind, Ghaso Kalan village is the most hit by Covid-19 with four infected patients, all of whom are undergoing treatment at PGIMS, Rohtak.When contacted, Jind civil surgeon Jai Bhagwan Jattan said they have reported 15 Covid-19 cases from seven villages, and most of them are linked to Delhi.“We have sealed these villages and conducted sampling of 3,400 persons in the district. Both the patients of Nidani village have been cured. On tracking the history of patients, we found that Delhi’s Azadpur mandi is a big threat to us as far as the contagion is concerned,” he added.Sonepat civil surgeon B S Rajoura too attributed the rise in cases to the Delhi connection.“The villages have reported more infected patients as we had tracked them by carrying out random sampling. We have collected samples of vegetable sellers, who frequented Delhi’s Azadpur mandi. Those commuting from Delhi on a daily basis are also being tested. Our main focus is to carry out more sampling in rural and urban areas so that patients can be cured on time,” said Rajoura.Requesting anonymity, a health official from Sonepat said that the cases in villages were increasing because patients were not approaching them till the field staff would visit their homes.“On many occasions, people don’t cooperate by revealing their contacts and travel histories,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/rural-belt-of-5-haryana-dists-hit-harder-by-virus-health-dept-worried/story-p6w2Ynh93GZCu6qRSRryJN.html

11-05-2020||City||Former Punjab DGP Multani was tortured in Saini’s presence: Eyewitness||Though former Punjab DGP Sumedh Singh Saini has been granted anticipatory bail in connection with the disappearance of one Balwant Singh Multani of Mohali in 1991, an advocate got her statement recorded before a magistrate, claiming she was witness to the victim’s (Multani’s) torture in police custody. Saini and six others were booked recently in connection with the disappearance of Multani, a junior engineer posted with Chandigarh Industrial and Tourism Corporation (CITCO), after a terrorist attack in 1991.“Multani could hardly walk when I last saw him then how could he escape from custody,” said advocate Gursharan Kaur Mann. She got her statement recorded under Section 164 of the CrPC before judicial magistrate Amit Bakshi on Monday.“We could hear Multani scream through the night. Next day (December 13) when I went to the bathroom, I saw him (Multani) lying in the verandah bleeding. Saini came and asked the policemen to throw Multani in the vehicle and that was last we saw him (Multani),” said Mann whose husband was Multani’s classmate in engineering.Claiming to be the eyewitness to Multani’s torture, Mann said she, along with her husband and 2-year-old son, was picked up by the police on intervening night of December 10-11, 1991. Mann said she later came to know that they were arrested in connection with a 1991 blast (assassination attempt on Saini).“We were taken to Sector 17 police station Chandigarh. Next day, I saw Multani in pain owing to the torture by police. He could hardly walk, Saini kicked him multiple times, threatening to kill him,” said Mann. “One witness got statement recorded before the court. We are hopeful more people will follow,” said Pradeep Virk, counsel for the complainant.Mann, along with her husband, was an accused in the 1991 blast case and was acquitted later. She recorded her statement in connection with a fresh FIR registered Mataur police station against former DGP Saini on the complaint of Palwinder Singh Multani, brother of Balwant Singh Multani.The case was registered under Sections 364, 201, 330, 344, 219 and 120-B of the IPC on May 6, 2020.

11-05-2020||Chandigarh||PM-CMs video conference: Captain Amarinder Singh for continuation of lockdown, with exit plan||Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Monday pitched for extension of the ongoing lockdown, but with a carefully crafted strategy for fiscal and economic empowerment of the states. At a video conference of chief ministers with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Amarinder said the states needed to be given greater flexibility in micro-planning as part of an exit strategy in view the increasing Covid-19 cases across the country.“The exit strategy should consider and focus on fiscal and economic empowerment of the states, which are responsible for the real action directly affecting livelihood of the common man. Micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) to be allowed to function in red-zone districts with proper safeguards. The decision on designating the red, orange, yellow and green zones should be left to the states,” the Punjab CM said.Amarinder demanded immediate financial assistance to the states to meet at least 33% of their committed liabilities, along with revenue grants for three months to meet the shortfall in revenue and to fund expenditure on Covid-19.He also called for a national strategy on testing for making the battle against Covid-19 more effective, pointing out that he had also written to the PM to direct central institutions in Chandigarh and Punjab to increase their testing capacity.Punjab has so far carried out 40,962 tests with current daily testing rate at 2,500, which the state government is planning to scale up to 6,000 a day by end of the month, he informed.Pointing out that the state has procured 115 lakh metric tonnes wheat, adhering to the Covid protocols, Amarinder requested for an early declaration of minimum support price (MSP) for paddy and a bonus on non-burning of stubble.Besides, he informed Modi that Punjab was losing ₹3,000 crore every month in revenue. The Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) was facing a loss of ₹30 crore daily, he claimed.He reiterated his demand for immediate release of the state’s Goods and Service Tax (GST) arrears of ₹4,365.37 crore.He said around 56,000 persons from Punjab stranded in other states had registered on the government portal.As many as 11.50 lakh migrants in Punjab have registered for moving to their home states, mainly UP, Bihar and Jharkhand, with 50 trains carrying migrants having already left, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pm-cms-video-conference-captain-amarinder-singh-for-continuation-of-lockdown-with-exit-plan/story-ulNzqtGqXi7QQr0ssrTsJN.html

All of them are Nanded returnees and this protest came two days after a 34-year-old patient had fled from the hospital on Saturday; he was later caught and brought back. “Most patients in the hospital had returned from Nanded on April 27, and our tests were conducted on April 28. Reports were received between May 1 and May 6. Fourteen days have passed since we came here, but our retesting has not been done. Most patients are asymptomatic,” claimed a 24-year-old patient, who was among the protesters. The protesters also claimed that in eight families, only the child had tested positive, but with parents staying with them, their cases needed priority. “At least, the re-testing of such children, who have completed 14 days must start,” said a protester. Protesters were finally pacified after the assistant deputy commissioner (ADC) assured them their grievances will be resolved.Civil surgeon Dr Anoop Kumar said, “Patients have been assured that their retesting will be conducted. They have also been informed about relevant government procedures.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/seeking-re-testing-patients-protest-at-tarn-taran-hospital/story-ig2dXawrFwa5gVUi7x4OSK.html
11-05-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh’s quarantined cop links copper wire thief to TikTok video, cracks case||Being quarantined for Covid-19 can have its benefits, as proved by a Chandigarh police constable who used the spare time to crack a case of theft after getting leads from TikTok videos and CCTV camera grabs, police said on Monday.Constable Gurjant Singh, working with deputy superintendent of police (DSP) central, Krishan Kumar’s team, identified Mukesh Singh, 20, and Manish alias Golu, 18, as the men who had attacked and injured city advocate Amit Sethi as he tried to stop them from stealing copper wire from the rooftop of his Sector 9 house on March 17.Gurjant Singh, who was given the task of scrutinising the social media accounts of people who worked in Sethi’s house while quarantined, found similarities between the suspect spotted in a CCTV grab and the TikTok videos of a domestic helper.Further investigations revealed that the helper was Mukesh’s sister and that he too had been worked for some time at Sethi’s residence.“The… person in the TikTok video resembled the thief seen in the CCTV video. That was our first clue that led us to Mukesh,” said Krishan Kumar.After his arrest Mukesh admitted that he had worked in the past with Sethi and had decided to steal the copper wires from there. But as Sethi, on hearing noises, decided to come up and investigate, Mukesh and his accomplice attacked and injured him.After committing the crime the two wanted to escape to West Bengal and had also booked train tickets, but the Covid-19 lockdown forced them to stay back, Krishan Kumar added.The two men were booked under Section 34 (acts done by several persons with common intention), 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt), 379 (punishment for theft), 511 (punishment for attempting to commit offences punishable with imprisonment for life) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

11-05-2020||City||Gym owner with criminal record shot dead in Kherki Daula||Gurugram: A 35-year-old gym owner was allegedly shot dead by at least three men over personal enmity at Naurangpur village in the Kherki Daula area on Monday morning. The gym owner, who had a criminal record, sustained at least 14 gunshot wounds, the police said.According to the police, the incident took place around 5.30am when the victim, Manjeet Yadav from Shikohpur, was taking a morning walk at a mini stadium in the village with his son, aged 8, and 15-year-old daughter. However, his two minor children escaped unhurt as they were in a separate area of the stadium at the time of the incident, said the police. Yadav was accused in at least five criminal cases, including the murder of a toll operator at Kherki Daula in 2011, in which he was later acquitted, the police said. Deepak Saharan, deputy commissioner of police (DCP), Manesar, said, “The victim was also accused in at least three cases of assault and possession of illegal weapons. Preliminary probe suggests that the suspects had conducted a recce. Past enmity seems to be the motive. Several crime teams are trying to trace the suspects.”When Yadav was sitting on a bench, at least three armed men alighted from an SUV outside the stadium and approached him, the official said, adding that he was shot at from a close distance. The victim sustained at least 14 gunshot wounds in the chest, abdomen, head and legs. “Yadav was rushed to a private hospital, where he was declared brought dead. At the time of the incident, his children were playing at a distance and heard the commotion. We are questioning them to identify the suspects,” said the police official, adding that Yadav was earlier an associate of gangster Bhanwar Singh, who was killed in a police encounter in 2018. In a police complaint, Yadav’s maternal uncle said that personal enmity was suspected to be the reason for the murder. “I received a phone call around 5.30am and immediately asked two relatives to rush to the spot,” he said in the FIR. A case was registered against the suspects under sections 302 (murder) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code and sections 25/54/59 of the Arms Act at Kherki Daula police station on Monday. In 2011, a toll operator was allegedly shot dead after an argument over payment of Rs 27 toll fee in Kherki Daula. In the subsequent probe, Yadav was arrested as an accomplice of the main accused. However, he was acquitted in the case in 2015 for lack of evidence, the police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gym-owner-with-criminal-record-shot-dead-in-kherki-daula/story-aCRRJTuJ70J05X25iwwQyO.html
11-05-2020||City||State ASHA workers battle abuse, poor salary and lack of proper training||Gurugram On April 23, Rekha Sharma, 39, an ASHA (Accredited Social Health Activists) worker in Ballabgarh, had gone to a society in Sector 65, Faridabad, to conduct a door-to-door survey for coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak. As she was questioning the members of a family about their travel history, they started insulting her. Within minutes, a crowd gathered around her and started abusing her. “People were aggressive and abusive. They fished out wooden sticks from their houses and threatened to take us hostage. Within ten minutes, a police team arrived at the spot. Although they tried to intervene, they too were assaulted sticks and rods,” she said.Five people were arrested in the incident, which left Sharma and two police officials injured. Sharma’s case is not an isolated incident. A day later, another ASHA worker was allegedly assaulted by three men who had accused her of collecting data for the controversial National Register of Citizens (NRC), while conducting the survey in Nuh. Last week, another ASHA worker was harassed while her daughter, who was accompanying her, was allegedly assaulted by a family when it was asked to quarantine.Incidents of physical violence against frontline workers, such as medical professionals and ASHA workers, have been reported from across the state. The ASHA workers are tasked by the district administration to conduct door-to-door surveys in residential areas and collect data on people’s medical history. They are also required to advise residents about precautions, use of masks and social distancing norms. However, despite their difficult job requirements and stressful conditions, the ASHA workers in the state are battling several other challenges. These include harassment, violent attacks, inadequate training and lack of devices such as smartphones.Fighting misinformationOne of the toughest challenges faced by ASHA workers is the misconceptions people harbour against the exercise of collecting information. Parmila Sarvakar, an ASHA worker in Gurugram, said, “When we ask questions related to symptoms or travel histories, people get agitated and refuse to cooperate. They are sceptical and assume that the government is gathering information for other purposes. Some assume that the government will provide them with free ration. We are helpless at times as we are not giving away any free ration but simply taking down medical details,” said Sarvakar.Sajida, an ASHA worker in Nuh, said that she was assaulted after people thought that she was collecting details for the National Population Register (NPR). “On April 21, I had gone out to conduct a Covid-19 survey along with an Anganwadi worker in Nuh. In one house, people got irritated upon seeing us and asked us as to why we were conducting an NPR survey. They took away all our forms. I was beaten up in front of the sarpanch when I asked them about their symptoms,” said Sajida.As the ASHA workers come under the National Health Mission (NHM) the Haryana head of NHM said that workers have to write to the chief medical officer (CMO) and the deputy commissioner (DC) of their respective areas, asking for security. The mission director (MD) of NHM Haryana, Prabhjot Singh, said, “Assigning police does not fall under my domain; rather it is the duty of the deputy commissioner. The superintendent of police (SP) and the DC are required to maintain the law and order situation of their area.”Challenges of collecting informationThe health department has directed the ASHA workers to cover at least 50 houses in a day. Several ASHA workers said that people often withhold information about their illnesses due to the stigma attached to the disease and the fear of being quarantined.Hemlata Goyal, an ASHA worker in Faridabad, said, “In certain cases, people do not disclose the correct information. People are scared to report that a family member has flu-like symptoms as they fear that the health department will quarantine them,” said Goyal.Several ASHA workers said that the changes in guidelines for collecting information have also compounded the problem. Before April 9, the ASHA workers were given a three-point survey form requiring details, such as a person’s name, address and whether or not they were feeling well. The workers said that two days later, another elaborate form was given to them, asking them to return to the houses, where the survey had been completed.Meera Devi, a senior ASHA worker in Gurugram, said, “On April 11, we were given a 13-point form, requiring details of high-risk people, including details about a possible pregnancy, diabetes, high blood pressure, a heart condition, cancer, tuberculosis, kidney ailments, asthmatic conditions and their age.”“People got irritated when they were asked for additional details for a second time. A few of them even abused us,” said Sajida.Lack of trainingASHA workers alleged that they were provided training for barely two hours, which included inputs on how to differentiate between symptoms of coronavirus and influenza and how to recognise people who were at a higher risk of contracting the virus.“We were given training only for a few hours on how to do the survey. The training was verbal and nothing was given to us in writing,” said, Rekha Kumar, an ASHA worker and facilitator in Mewat.The ASHA workers also said that earlier they were given physical forms to fill up the information, which was handed over to their supervisors, who would then upload the information. But now they have been asked to upload the information on a smartphone, which many of them do not have.“Our seniors told us in the last week of April that we need to buy smartphones to fill in the details of the coronavirus survey. Most of the ASHA workers come from poor families and they cannot afford an android phone,” said Devi, an ASHA worker from Gurugram.Officials of NHM said that buying android phones won’t be an issue for the frontline workers but they can’t specify any date by which the phones will be given to them.“We have not sent out any written guidelines for the ASHA workers to purchase android phones. The process to procure mobile phones is underway,” added Singh.No monetary rewardsAnother issue bothering these workers is that while Haryana government has doubled the salaries of some frontline health workers, such as doctors, nurses and health workers, the ASHA workers have been left behind. Several ASHA workers complained of discrimination and demanded higher salaries and smartphones that would enable them to carry out their jobs.“The state government has discriminated against us. We are only getting ₹4,000 as salary. We don’t even know if the insurance announced by government covers us and whether our family members will even get the sum insured after our death,” added Goyal.Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar, however, had earlier announced that a life cover of ₹50 lakh against Covid-19 announced by the Government of India will be given to all doctors, nurses and Group C and Group D employees posted in Covid isolation wards, Covid ICU and Covid OTs. The ASHA workers fall under Group D category of employees. Khattar also announced an additional life insurance cover of ₹10 lakh for various employees including ASHA workers, Anganwadi workers, police personnel and sanitation workers who are working in the containment zones and for all accredited and recognised journalists in Haryana, up to June 30, 2020.“The insurance cover is for ₹50 lakhs and government of Haryana is providing another ₹10 lakh ex-gratia amount also to them,” said Prabhjot Singh.Personal protectionThe ASHA workers said that they are provided with personal protective equipment (PPE) when they go out to the containment zones. Sarita, an ASHA worker in Gurugram, said, “We are given PPE kits when we go out and do a survey in a high-risk zone. When the survey had started initially, we were not given masks but then after a week or so we were provided with masks, one soap and a hand sanitiser.

The two other positive cases include a man from Krishna Nagar and another from Sector 105. A total of 145 Covid-19 cases have been reported in Gurugram so far of which 67 persons have been discharged.Dr Jaswant Singh Punia, district chief medical officer (CMO), said, “Three positive cases have been reported on Monday. A five-year-old from Basai Enclave contracted the Sars-Cov-2 virus from her mother, who had tested positive last week. The mother and daughter were in contact with the family of a Covid-19 positive man who works as a driver for Delhi Police.” The man had confirmed positive for Covid-19 on May 3. In April, a two-year-old boy, a resident of Jharsa, had tested positive for the deadly infection, and was the youngest Covid-19 patient in Gurugram. Last week, he was discharged from the Covid-19 facility at SGT Medical College Hospital along with his mother. A 45-year-old bank employee, a resident of Krishna Colony, also tested positive for Covid-19. CMO Punia said the man was in contact with a colleague who was admitted to a private hospital last week after testing positive for Covid-19. The colleague has now been shifted to ESIC hospital. The health team is trying to trace the contacts of man from Sector 105 who tested positive on Monday. The man works as a taxi driver. “We are still probing how the man contracted the virus. Based on the information he gave, he used to visit a milk booth in his neighbourhood from where he seemed to have contracted the infection. The contact tracing in the case, however, is ongoing,” the CMO said.The district health team on Monday collected 139 samples for testing. Till now, over 8,356 samples have been collected in Gurugram as a part of contact tracing, targeted and random sampling. Out of these, 7,738 have tested negative, while test results are awaited for 473 samples. As many as 61 persons are under institutional quarantine in a Sector 9 facility.FOURTH COVID FATALITY IN FARIDABADA 65-year-old man died of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in Faridabad on Monday. This is the fourth Covid-19 death in the district. The man was a Sector 18 resident, and his death is the second Covid-19 fatality in the district in the last two days after a 72-year-old died of the virus on Sunday. Six more people also tested positive for Covid-19 on Monday in Faridabad, and the total number of cases in the district is now 102.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/five-year-old-among-three-new-covid-19-cases-gurugram-s-total-count-reaches-145/story-5qM66Cs5AwxLuEAFooxVzK.html

In a statement released on Monday, district education officer Indu Boken said that the department had received around 175 complaints against 36 private schools in the district, following which action was taken against them as per rules. “We served a notice to the erring schools and asked them to comply with the government orders. All schools have resolved the concerns. Further action is not required since they are now complying with the government directives,” said Boken. Boken further said that the livelihood of many people had been adversely affected amid the lockdown due to which the government had prohibited payment of additional fee heads. She reiterated that schools could not take any punitive action against students for non-payment of fees.As per rule 158 of Haryana School Education Rules, the department can check the accounts of a school and take appropriate action in case of fee-related complaints. Schools are required to submit the details of fees charged in Form-6 every year.In the wake of the Covid-19 crisis, the Haryana government had issued orders regarding the payment of fees on April 23, according to which only monthly tuition fee can be sought during the lockdown. Payment of other charges such as building fund, maintenance fund, entrance fee, and computer fee, under additional heads has also been deferred. The government also prohibited private schools from hiking the tuition fees or introducing hidden charges in the fee, and asked them to collect the tuition fee on a monthly basis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ggm-36-private-schools-issued-notice-for-flouting-fee-rules/story-NibuGYixtIg6ZpldojkzuM.html
11-05-2020||Lucknow||How prepared are you to tackle health crisis amid Covid-19: HC to hospitals||The Allahabad high court on Monday asked the state government to apprise it of medical facilities available in 11 hospitals of Prayagraj to cope with current health crisis risen due to spread of Covid-19.The hospitals are SRN Hospital, Prathamik Chikitsalaya Kendra, Dufferin Hospital, Colvin Hospital, Kamala Nehru Hospital, SN Children Hospital, Sardar Patel Memorial, TB Sapru Hospital, TB Hospital, Rajkiya Medical Care Unit, Phaphamau and Government Hospital, Prayagraj.The court has also asked the state government to inform it whether these hospitals have intensive coronary care units, intensive care and dialysis units, ventilators and mobile X-ray machines or not. The bench comprising chief justice Govind Mathur and justice Siddhartha Varma further asked the state government to inform it about the number of qualified doctors and nurses working in these hospitals. Further, the state government was asked to furnish details regarding sanitisation and cleanliness drives carried out in these hospitals. On May 7, the high court took cognizance of a letter addressed to chief justice raising the issue of death of one Virendra Singh (of Prayagraj) who was corona positive and allegedly died due to laxity in treatment.The court also took cognizance of a video clip which is in circulation disclosing pathetic conditions at quarantine centres here.On Monday, the state government counsel apprised the court on the issue after which the bench observed, “The video which had been floated by the wife of the deceased also showed certain slackness on the part of the administration so far as the maintenance of the quarantine centres were concerned.”“The instructions as have been received by the e-mail show that there were sufficient steps taken by the state to improve the quarantine centres. The treatment which was administered to Sri VK Singh also appears to be appropriate,” said the bench on allegations that Singh died due to laxity in treatment. On May 5, advocate Gaurav Kumar Gaur sent an email to chief justice that wife of Virendra Singh had informed him that the quarantine centre where her husband and other family members were kept lacked hygienic conditions and that no adequate treatment was provided to her husband who later succumbed to Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/how-prepared-are-you-to-tackle-health-crisis-amid-covid-19-hc-to-hospitals/story-Oc1vhSa4sdMXuvTKz2bexK.html
11-05-2020||Gurugram||Colleges yet to receive guidelines on exams, summer vacations||College students in the city, whose semester schedules have been disrupted by the ongoing lockdown to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), said that they were uncertain about the future course of action with little clarity over exams and results. Students said that they were worried about missing summer internships and placements and were hoping that the situation is resolved soon.The University Grants Commission (UGC) recently issued guidelines for examinations and the academic calendar, and suggested that colleges may adopt the calendar or modify it as per their needs. The state higher education department, however, is yet to issue any direction on the subject. College principals said that they had not received any specific directive from the higher education department on exams, assessments, and in the absence of any guidelines, remote classes would take place until the end of the lockdown.Pooja Khullar, principal, Dronacharya Government College, said that colleges were awaiting directions from the department and until then, online classes were taking place. “We have been informed that we will get an update soon. We will apprise students as and when we get clarity from the administration but until then, we can only wait and watch,” Khullar said.She added that teachers had been receiving many queries from worried students. “We have been receiving a lot of queries from students. Students in the final year, especially, tend to get worried as many of them plan to pursue higher education,” Khullar said.Satyamanyu Yadav, principal of Government College in Sector 9, said that though the UGC had issued guidelines, the state government was yet to issue the guidelines that were to be adopted. He said that online classes would continue routinely till May 17 until there is clarity on the lockdown. Yadav said that the resumption of physical activities in the college might take a long while since it had been turned into a quarantine facility. “We are trying to utilise online resources wherever possible. While placement couldn’t take place on campus, we have tied up with a tech company for online courses which will help students in placements in the future,” Yadav said.Deepakshi Antil, a 20-year-old student of the Government Girls College in Sector 14, said that while there was no clarity on the final exams, classes were continuing remotely. “Class notes and assignments are shared with us. We also took an online internal assessment exam comprising multiple-choice questions,” Antil, a final-year student of History honours, said. She added that students were stressed since placement prospects looked bleak and there was little they could do in the absence of a clear schedule. “A job fair that was supposed to take place at our college was cancelled due to the lockdown. Right now, we cannot initiate anything new on the job front. We don’t even know when and how the exams will take place. Ambiguity prevails over the final exams and results too,” she said.Deepak Swamy, a final-year English honours student of Dronacharya Government College, said that many universities had already started seeking applications while exams were yet to start. “Some universities have already given out forms. With the current state of affairs, some of us are unsure if we should apply or wait until the situation improves,” Swamy said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/colleges-yet-to-receive-guidelines-on-exams-summer-vacations/story-b1JYhwrTAsKE3fcwXu6NhP.html
11-05-2020||Gurugram||Three private hospitals collaborate to run a designated Covid-19 hospital||In a one of a kind initiative, three private hospitals in the city—Medanta, Fortis and Artemis—are collaborating to operate the Medeor Hospital in IMT Manesar as a designated Covid-19 hospital. The three hospitals will be providing their doctors, health staff and equipment to tackle Covid-19 cases. Officials and senior doctors said that setting up the dedicated facility will also help resume normal functioning and surgeries in city hospitals.The facility will be in addition to the other Covid-19 hospital, ESIC in Sector 9A, which is already under considerable strain after a surge in the number of cases in the city. Of the city’s 142 cases, over 60 patients are admitted to the 100-bed ESIC hospital. The district administration and the health department have also roped in six private hospitals—Metro, Naryana, Signature, Columbia Asia, Park and W Pratiksha—which will reserve 100 beds each for Covid-19 patients, adding 600 beds to the existing capacity.VS Kundu, monitoring in-charge for Covid-19 in Gurugram, said, “Medeor wasn’t functional initially as it lacked the adequate manpower and experience required to handle the Covid-19 load. The state health department’s initial plan was to requisition health staff and equipment from other districts to run the hospital but it was not sufficient. Instead, we thought of collaborating with private hospitals to make it functional.” The health department had first declared Medeor a dedicated hospital for Covid-19 treatment in March.According to Kundu, the idea to run a collaborative designated Covid-19 hospital was floated by chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar and Medanta’s chairman and managing director Dr Naresh Trehan.Each of the three hospitals will provide four doctors along with 18 nurses in the first two weeks. Later, 18 additional nurses will be deployed. This will be in addition to Medeor’s current staff of 100 nurses and 30 doctors. Currently, Medeor has dedicated 120 beds for Covid-19 patients, which will be increased to 180 beds. A 20-bed ICU facility has also been set up to take care of critical patients. “We are currently limiting hospital services for Covid-19 patients. It is a 500-bed hospital, of which at least 120 beds are dedicated for Covid-19 patients,” Nihaj Muhammed, COO, Medeor Hospital, said. Dr Naresh Trehan said, “The hospital will cater to all Covid-19 patients, whether asymptomatic or critical. Later the plan is to involve a hotel or a facility in the vicinity of the hospital to keep asymptomatic patients or patients with mild symptoms.”“With this initiative, we will be able to help non-Covid-19 patients who are waiting for their surgeries and treatments. Surgeries have been paused in the last five weeks,” Dr Trehan said, adding it would help take away the psychological fear that visiting a hospital would make people contract the virus.Ashutosh Raghuvanshi, CEO, Fortis Healthcare, said, “A 120-bed hospital is sufficient for a couple of months. If necessary, we will increase the number of beds. We are utilising good infrastructure by pooling in resources. It will be easy for us to take care of non-Covid patients who are in immediate need of therapy, surgery and dialysis.”The three hospitals have been admitting patients since March after Covid-19 cases with travel history started being reported. Dr Sushila Katariya of Medanta hospital will handle the team of doctors at Medeor. She was a part of the team that treated 14 Italian tourists who tested positive in March and were admitted in Medanta.The state health department has also permitted home isolation of Covid-19 patients who have mild symptoms or are asymptomatic, only in case of requisite arrangements at the house.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/three-private-hospitals-collaborate-to-run-a-designated-covid-19-hospital/story-xSMxxnJEUECIsqFMkmq4RL.html
11-05-2020||Gurugram||Migrants, students distressed, anxious as landlords push for rent||A fortnight ago, Dinesh Kumar, his wife and his three children were allegedly evicted from their rented room in Bas Kusla village, Manesar, after Kumar, the sole breadwinner in the family, could not pay the monthly rent of ₹2,900 to his landlord. Kumar, a migrant worker, had arrived in the city in March from Panchhi, Kanpur, and started working at a garment company. After the lockdown was imposed, he lost his job.“The landlord asked me to either pay rent for April or to vacate the house. I pleaded with him and said that since I could not go to work, I did not have any income with which to pay him. He started misbehaving with us and asked us to leave,” Kumar said.Kumar packed his essentials in two bags and set off for Kanpur on foot, but was asked by the police to return. Finding no refuge, he settled in a vacant shanty in a slum near IMT Chowk. “We have been surviving on pulses and rice distributed in a government school nearby. Twice a day, I get food from the school. If the situation does not change and the lockdown continues, I shall try to start walking back to my village in Kanpur again,” he said.Kumar is among the many people in the city who have been hit the hardest due to the lockdown that was imposed to prevent the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Struggling to foot bills as economic activity remains restricted, many—especially migrant workers and students—have been unable to pay rent and face eviction. The tenants said that they had been living in ‘perpetual anxiety’ as landlords continued to ‘push’ for rent. Several alleged that landlords had issued veiled threats of eviction and in certain extreme cases, threatened police action, to force them into paying rent.In April, the Haryana government had issued directions stating that landlords should not demand house rent for a month from migrant workers, students and paramedics in rural areas of the state. In the order, the authorities had said that if any landlord was found forcing such tenants to vacate, they would be liable to face strict criminal action. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) had issued an order on March 29 asking landlords to stop demanding rent from students, workers and migrant labourers for a month.Despite the order, tenants allegedly continue to face harassment and repeated warnings. In April, at least seven landlords were booked and arrested for forcibly demanding rent from tenants in the city. Mukul Arya from Uttarakhand, who is a BA student in the city, has been renting a room for ₹6,000 per month at U-block in DLF Phase 3. “My father sends me the rent money but since the pandemic, his travel business has suffered. I told my landlord to defer the rent collection for a few weeks, hoping that the lockdown would end. But the landlord kept asking me for the rent. Last week, I vacated the room and have been staying with a friend since I did not want to burden my parents for the rent money in such a crisis,” he said.Anand Shankar, a postgraduate student of law at a private university, said that he had to borrow ₹10,000 from a friend to pay his rent for last month. “I do not know how I will pay another month’s rent. My father used to wire me money from Punia, Bihar, every month for rent. Since the lockdown, he has not been able to go to the bank and he is not well-versed with online payment methods. I have requested the landlord for some relaxation. Otherwise, I shall have to move to a smaller room with more affordable rent. But how do I hunt for a house during the lockdown?” he asked.As the lockdown continues, migrant workers continue to face the uncertain choice of leaving for their far-flung hometowns for an indefinite period or surviving on a pittance, hoping for work and economic activity to resume. Many, who were forced out of their shanties due to non-payment of rent, took shelter at relief centres run by the district administration for a few days before opting to return to their villages.Rohit Rawat, who worked as a cook in the city, stayed in a relief camp in Sukhrali as he could not afford to pay rent after losing his job. “I had no money or savings. The eatery where I worked closed down, forcing me to leave. I took shelter at a relief centre. But one cannot stay there forever. So, I returned on a bus to my hometown in Pauri Garhwal in Uttarakhand. I do not think I shall ever return,” he said.Harish Chand, who worked as a mason in the city for nine years, said that three days after the first lockdown was announced, his landlord asked him to pay rent or vacate his shanty in Gurgaon Gaon. “I was not getting any work and the landlord was continuously threatening me for the rent. So, I vacated the shanty and left for Tikamgarh, Madhya Pradesh, leaving all my belongings behind,” Chand said. He, his wife and five children walked 60 kilometres, took several buses along the way and hitched a ride from a truck driver to finally reach their village. It took them five days.Varinder Singh Kundu, the additional chief secretary of Haryana and nodal officer for Covid-19 in Gurugram, said, “In this regard, the administration is ensuring compliance with the orders of the government. Till the orders are not revised, they will be implemented. We had received feedback that some people were forcibly demanding rent and action has been taken in those cases,” Kundu said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/migrants-students-distressed-anxious-as-landlords-push-for-rent/story-VqxqxlwtaceoLb0asU7aeJ.html
11-05-2020||Chandigarh||Warring’s bid to cash in on migrant labourers’ travel home raises eyebrows||The local Congress leadership is facing social media flak and opposition disapproval for trying to draw political mileage out of migrant labourers’ crisis, after its Gidderbaha MLA Amrinder Singh Raja Waring and other party workers distributed pamphlets among them, crediting the party with paying for their travel.The first such train from Bathinda, the Shramik Express, carrying 1,388 passengers had left for Muzaffarpur in Bihar on Sunday morning in which pamphlets were distributed. The pamphlets were distributed from the platform, with a video of the incident going viral on social media on Monday. Another train for Daltonganj in Jharkhand left Bathinda Sunday evening. To take credit, Congress leaders verbally said to labourers that its their party president Sonia Gandhi and chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh who paid for their travel. The pamphlets claim that its the Congress party which has come to help the people. “The central government is wrongly claiming that its making contribution in paying the rail fare of labourers but the fact is that Punjab government is fully paying the fare,” claim the pamphlets. Sharing the video over Facebook, a user Jagsher Sidhu commented, “People doing this should be ashamed, as irrespective of who paid for the travel, taking political mileage out of the plight of stranded migrant labourers is not done.” Bathinda deputy commissioner B Srinivasan said the administration had paid for travel expenses of migrant labourers from the State Disaster Relief Fund. NGOs helped with making arrangement for food, he added. Former Bathinda (urban) MLA and SAD leader Sarup Chand Singla said, “It is unfortunate that Congress leaders are trying to draw political mileage out of the condition of migrant labourers. The Congress has failed to provide help to the needy during the lockdown.” Bathinda Improvement Trust chairman KK Aggarwal, who also distributed these pamphlets said, committees of Congress workers had been formed to coordinate with the administration to ensure that the migrant labourers don’t face any problem. “There is no politics in what we did as it is not even certain if these workers will back and vote in Punjab. The state party leadership had designed these pamphlets.”Warring couldn’t be contacted despite repeated calls on his mobile phone. The former Youth Congress president, however, is no stranger to controversies. During a campaign address in Pilibanga assembly segment in Rajasthan assembly polls in December 2018, Warring had spoken of giving “Khansi Wali Davai” (cough syrup) to those who come to Punjab after electing a Congress candidate. He was accused of promoting liquor consumption.During panchayat elections in Punjab in December 2018, his video of allegedly saying that state government has many methods to reject or accept the nomination papers had also gone viral on social media. At the time, the SAD and the AAP had been accusing the Congress of rejecting nomination papers of their nominees on frivolous grounds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/warring-s-bid-to-cash-in-on-migrant-labourers-travel-home-raises-eyebrows/story-mMzdxsUy0v3x96qug5mZ7L.html

The Lohgarh village resident, who returned from Nanded in one of the buses sent by the Punjab government on April 29, was quarantined at the congregation centre of Dera Radha Soami at Verka on the outskirts of Amritsar city.Her husband said, “The health department collected swab samples of my wife and other pilgrims who were quarantined on May 1. Of the 41 persons, 14 tested positive and were admitted to the Guru Nanak Dev Hospital (GNDH0, Amritsar. The rest of 27 who tested negative were kept in isolation till May 9.”“I received a phone call on Sunday afternoon. The person on call informed me that they are coming to take my wife again as her report was positive. I brought it to the notice of the tehsildar concerned who too said the reports of 27 pilgrims, including my wife, were negative. But a health department team along with police personnel took my wife along,” he added.“I demanded from them the report in which she had tested positive. The report they provided me has no stamp and signature and looks like a forged one. The matter should be investigated thoroughly,” he said.Verka senior medical officer (SMO) Dr Desh Raj said, “This happened because there were two women of the same name.”On the other hand, Amritsar civil surgeon Dr Jugal Kishore said, “She had not tested negative, but her report was pending. She along with other Nanded-returnees was sent home because we had to vacate the quarantine centre for more persons to be put under quarantine. Her report came on Sunday evening, according to which she tested positive.”Charandeep Singh Bhinder, a social worker who raised the issue with the health department, said another test should be conducted on the woman.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/covid-19-woman-sent-home-for-testing-ve-brought-back-next-day-as-infected/story-YCbitGz1nzEUxx3Y5c4PnL.html

The commission agents said that they were “the victims of the faulty policies of the government”.“We had raised this issue with the government in 2015 and 2016 but they did not take it seriously. The commission agents even took Sangita to the police station but no action was taken against her and other accused,” said a commission agent of Karnal grain market.They alleged that Sangita had come to Karnal to sell her plot and was arrested by the police who failed to take prompt action against her and she was later bailed out, they alleged. Responding to the allegations, Karnal superintendent of police Surender Singh Bhoria said, “The incident was reported in 2016-17 and I was not much aware of it. But the Karnal police were ready to extend all support to the CBI and other investigating agencies in the case if required.”Secretary of Haryana Ahrtiya Association Vikas Singhal said the government has a policy for procurement of parmal rice varieties which is procured by government agencies, but in case of procurement of Basmati varieties, the government does not have any role. “The government should take steps to protect arhtiyas so that such incidents can be stopped in future”, he added.“On one hand, the government has formulated a policy on procurement of paddy for government agencies, but on the other hand they do not intervene in case of procurement of basmati rice as it depends on the relationship between the buyers and arhtiyas”, said Karnal District Food and Supplies Controller Anil Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/411-crore-loan-fraud-arhtiyas-allege-cheating-of-9-5cr-by-3-karnal-exporters/story-Dp1c0mhOkOS0AJvBYDbnKL.html
11-05-2020||Chandigarh||As migrant workers head for home, BJP, Cong play politics in Punjab||In the midst of the battle against the dreaded Covid-19 pandemic, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress in Punjab are attempting to make the most of the migrant workers’ crisis.As members of the state unit of the BJP claimed that the Congress-led government did not provide the migrants any relief or benefits, because of which they had left the state, the Congress blamed the worker exodus from around the country on the BJP, saying it had “abandoned” them.In Mohali, around 1 lakh migrant workers from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand have registered with the administration to go back to their states, of which around 12,000 have already left by trains and buses. Some have walked back. More trains to Uttar Pradesh and Bihar are scheduled for the coming week from Mohali.Sahibee Anand, national executive member, BJP Youth Wing, said on Monday: “We tried to stop some of the migrants who were going to Bihar, but they were adamant, saying that for the past two months they had not received any dry rations from the government.”“The state government has not done anything to stop them. This will result in huge economic loss to industry and agriculture,” added Arun Sharma, BJP councillor.Accusing the BJP of stooping “low in this time of crisis,” Rajinder Singh Rana, former district president of the Congress, Mohali, said, “migrant workers are not only leaving from Punjab, but the entire country as the Union government has failed to provide them food and shelter in the most difficult times.” “It’s BJP’s habit to play dirty politics every time. Now the migrants have understood BJP politics in the entire country, and how they have been treated in this bad phase in their life,” said Rishabh Jain, senor deputy mayor.He said he hoped they would be back in two months when the situation normalised.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/as-migrant-workers-head-for-home-bjp-cong-play-politics-in-punjab/story-cjLKDZYmfAdXhmbXPjXY9O.html
11-05-2020||Lucknow||UP govt to build database of migrant workers||The Uttar Pradesh government has directed the revenue department to prepare a data base of migrant workers coming back to UP from various states. This database will be uploaded through software.Giving this information, additional chief secretary, home, Awanish Kumar Awasthi said chief minister Yogi Adityanath directed officers of all the state government departments to prepare a work plan for generating 20 lakh jobs for employing migrants in various sectors. Work in this regard has started.The revenue and labour departments will register the details of all the migrants, whether they are skilled or unskilled, he said.Around 22.27 lakh labourers were given jobs in various schemes being run in 44,242 gram panchayats, he said, adding 17 lakh workers will be employed in 64,912 medium and small scale industries in the state. Besides, 11,000 labourers have been employed in 544 projects launched by the public works department and another 10,000 labourers have been employed in construction of expressways, he said. MIGRANT INFLUX: SURVEILLANCE PANELS PUT ON ALERTThe state government has alerted the surveillance committees headed by gram pradhans in rural areas and ward councilors in urban areas about to the arrival of a large number of migrant workers from across the country to Uttar Pradesh.Giving this information, additional chief secretary, home, Awanish Kumar Awasthi and principal secretary, health and family welfare, Amit Mohan Prasad said the gram pradhans and ward councillors were directed to maintain vigil on the migrant workers arriving at the quarantine centres in the respective gram panchayats. They will also have to keep watch on the migrants who have been sent to the villages for 21 days’ home quarantine.They will have to ensure that migrant workers adhere to the state health department’s Covid protocol by remaining in home quarantine, not mixing with local people and going for regular screening. Their health report will be dispatched to the district magistrate and the chief medical officer’s office.The surveillance committee will have to alert the district administration and the health department if the migrant workers reach their native place without screening or completing 14 days quarantine.The officers said several migrant workers were returning from red zones. Hence, the surveillance committees have been directed to ensure that migrants do not go home directly from the railway station. They should first visit a shelter home and get screened, the officers said.

11-05-2020||City||19-year-old design engineer becomes first plasma donor in Noida||19-year-old design engineer Neha Jha on Monday became the first patient to donate her plasma for the convalescent plasma therapy after recovering from coronavirus disease (Covid-19).The design engineer is an employee of fire solutions company Ceasefire —which is responsible for at least 44 coronavirus cases in Gautam Budh Nagar. Jha donated her plasma at the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS), Greater Noida. According to officials at GIMS, a total of four patients who have recovered from Covid-19 will donate their plasma for the experimental procedure. “We are extremely thankful to Neha for donating her plasma, as it can prove helpful in treating critically ill patients. She is the first one who has donated plasma in our hospital, but there are other recovered patients, who are willing to donate their plasma. The plasma can help in treating Covid-19 patients as it can increase the fighting capacity of their immune systems. We will soon collect plasma from other patients, and use it for treating patients,” Dr Rakesh Gupta, director, GIMS, said. Jha was admitted to GIMS on March 26, and had tested Covid-19 positive on March 29. After she recovered from the deadly disease, she was discharged from the government hospital on April 22.“I decided to donate my plasma because I want to help others against coronavirus. I want to tell people that if one is mentally strong and motivated, then defeating the virus is not very difficult. Doctors at GIMS kept us motivated through counselling sessions and regular interactions,” she said. Jha is a resident of Sector 27, and working at Ceasefire— where she got infected with Covid-19— was her first job experience.Meanwhile, doctors GIMS and all officials handling the Covid-19 outbreak are all set to create a plasma bank at the Greater Noida facility.Narendra Bhooshan, chief executive officer, Greater Noida authority, who is also the district in-charge of handling Covid-19 efforts, said the plasma bank can help in treating serious Covid-19 cases at GIMS in the future.“We have expressed our gratitude to Neha for being brave and coming forward to donate her plasma. She is a corona warrior in the true sense because after defeating the disease she is helping others to fight it. With the plasma bank treating patients in future at GIMS and other hospitals can be easier,” said Bhooshan, who thanked Neha via a video call.GIMS officials said they have received the green signal to start clinical trials for convalescent plasma therapy “We will give the plasma to critically ill Covid-19 patients. One plasma donor can help many others in getting this treatment. The plasma therapy involves taking antibodies from the blood of a person who has recovered from Covid-19 and transfusing those antibodies into an active Covid-19 patient to help initiate the immune system to fight the infection,” Dr. Gupta said.So far, a total of 135 patients, out of 224 Covid-19 cases, have been cured in Gautam Budh Nagar. Two patients have died in the district so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/19-year-old-design-engineer-becomes-first-plasma-donor-in-noida/story-cf5mdzfoNxdOf8fGqkPBWL.html
11-05-2020||Noida||Many sneak out for work from sealed Khoda, cops stop their re-entry||Hundreds of daily wage earners who had snuck off to work on Monday morning from Khoda colony —a locality that was sealed by the Ghaziabad administration on Sunday after 15 Covid-19 cases were reported from there— were unable to return home in the evening with the police stopping them from entering the locality.On Sunday afternoon, about 50 of the 52 entry/exit points of the colony were barricaded and entry and exit to the general public was disallowed, except for those involved in essential services. According to the Ghaziabad health department officials, Khoda has reported about 17 cases (including two residents testing positive on Monday) since April 22 and a death, though the death audit report is yet to confirm the cause. The man, however, had tested positive for Covid-19.On Monday, as certain industrial units resumed operations in Gautam Budh Nagar, many daily wage earners left their residences in Khoda for their workplaces in Noida in the morning. But while returning, they were stopped at the Noida border and not allowed to enter Khoda.“We returned by the same route that we took in the morning but now we are not being allowed to go back because police say that the border is sealed. If so, why were we not stopped in the morning? I have children waiting for me at home. Now police are chasing us away from the border. How will my children manage if I don’t go back home?” said Sumita, a resident of Khoda working at a factory in Sector 58.According to estimates, Khoda spreads over an area of about five square kilometres and is located between Noida, Ghaziabad and Delhi. The officials say Khoda’s population is about 2.85 lakh but it’s estimated that the actual population may be more closer to four lakh.Khoda is vital to all three surrounding cities as a majority of workers in industrial areas, domestic helps and others engaged in small-time jobs in these cities live in the colony.Noida police said that any interdistrict movement is not allowed as per the government guidelines and most of these people often fine alternative routes to enter the district.“Crossing district boundaries is a violation of lockdown norms. Only people involved in essential services are allowed to do so,” additional deputy commissioner of police, zone 1, Kumar Ranvijay Singh said.The Ghaziabad district magistrate did not respond to calls seeking his comment on the matter.“In Red zone and Orange zone (areas with most number of Covid-19 cases) , movement of people is not allowed without passes. We have made repeated announcements in Khoda that there is a restriction on people’s movement. If any person sneaks out from Khoda, then that person has violated a law and will face consequences,” Manish Mishra, superintendent of police (city), Ghaziabad, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/many-sneak-out-for-work-from-sealed-khoda-cops-stop-their-re-entry/story-Uo5hmmGHpkIT4cGwp0iOGP.html
11-05-2020||Noida||Lok Nayak Hospital nurse among six new Covid-19 patients in GB Nagar||Six new Covid-19 cases were reported in Gautam Budh Nagar on Monday, taking the total number of positive cases to 224 in the district. The new cases include a woman from Sector 12 who works as nurse at Delhi’s Lok Nayak Hospital and three residents of Sector 66, health officials said. Giving details of the new patients, the officials said that a 22-year-old man undergoing treatment for some neuron disorder at Kailash Hospital in Sector 27 was found positive for coronavirus. The man is a resident of Sector 8 which is the most problematic cluster for the officials to contain the Covid-19 spread in the district. Around 52 persons have been found positive for the deadly virus from the JJ Colony of sectors 8, 9 and 10 till now.“The contact tracing team of the health department is identifying all the medical staff of the hospital and others who came in contact with the infected person. All such persons will be put under quarantine for 14 days,” said a senior official from the health department. Kailash Hospital authorities could not be contacted for comment despite multiple attempts.Also, a 40-year-old woman related to the 62-year-old man from Sector 66, who died of Covid-19 on Friday night, was found positive for coronavirus. Besides, two men, a 27-year-old and another 29-year-old, were also found positive for the infection from Sector 66. The duo had links with another patient from the area who was found positive earlier.Another two Covid-19 patients include a 53-year-old woman and her 48-year-old husband from Sector 12 of Noida. The woman is a staff member at the Lok Nayak Hospital in Delhi. The officials suspect that she contracted the infection at the hospital.Till now, over 37 medical and paramedical staff of different hospitals have been found positive for Covid-19 in the district.Meanwhile, district magistrate Suhas LY said that around 90% of the patients admitted by May 1 have been cured in GB Nagar. Till now, 135 patients have been discharged from various hospitals after being cured, while two people have succumbed to Covid-19. “We are giving hydroxychloroquine for one week and Tamiflu for five days in the first week. If the viral clearance report is positive, then only hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin are given in the second week. Our results have been very good. Condition of none of our patients who had developed pneumonia got deteriorated as the treatment is working on them,” said Dr Saurabh Shrivastava, head of medicines, Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS).Meanwhile, GIMS has started collecting plasma from the discharged patients to upgrade the treatment of Covid-19 patients as per the guidelines of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). Four recovered patients have donated their plasma for the treatment of others.As per the ICMR guidelines, the convalescent plasma therapy will be used on moderately severe patients. The officials said they have identified one patient who has been recently admitted at GIMS to use the new therapy on. By Monday night, the health department collected a total of 4,034 samples. Currently, there are 87 active Covid-19 cases in the district, while 452 persons are under institutional quarantine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/lok-nayak-hospital-nurse-among-six-new-covid-19-patients-in-gb-nagar/story-oDqJ8yxZVbxfIAGflFyvaK.html
11-05-2020||City||Ramprastha colony sealed 8 days after woman tested Covid positive||In an alleged case of laxity, the district administration took more than a week to seal an area of Ramprastha Colony, after a woman living in the area tested positive for Covid-19.According to norms, an area is to be sealed within 24 hours of a positive case being detected.Officials on Monday also said that they had issued notices to three highrises and sought their response over certain directions issued by their respective RWAs.In connection to the Ramprastha Colony issue, a 43 year-old-woman from the area had tested positive on May 1. But the sealing of the area was allegedly taken up a week later, on May 9, as per directions issued by additional city magistrate Devendra Pal Singh, who is also the incident commander of the assigned area.“It was probably after someone called up and informed the officials that they arrived to seal the area on May 9. Restrictions had been put in place before the sealing and one back gate of the colony had been locked,” said AK Gupta, a resident.The residents said that about 100-125 houses are affected due to sealing.Additional city magistrate Devendra Pal Singh, however, claimed that he issued directions for sealing as soon as he received the written information from the health department.“We issued the order of the sealing only when we received the letter from the health department. There was probably some delay on part of the health department in issuing the order. The total houses affected could be about 12-15, as per our estimates,” he said.Chief medical officer of the district, Dr NK Gupta, said that the sanitization of the areas is to be taken up immediately once a patient is identified as Covid-19 positive. The area is to be sealed immediately.“We issue the order to request sealing on same day or the next day. We will probe to find out when the order was sent to the administration officials,” he added.Meanwhile, the district administration on Monday also issued a statement stating that they have issued notices to three highrises — Gaur Green Avenue, Apartment Owners Association of Neelpdam Kunj and River Heights Phase-1 — after they allegedly issued some orders which were beyond their purview.Subodh Tyagi, the president of the River Heights Phase-1 apartment owners’ association (AOA) said that they had put up notices in their society in which they had threatened to levy penalty of Rs 11,000 against anyone who brings in outsiders in side the society, which has 750 flats.The notice put up by the AOA also said that in case the penalty is not deposited, the light and water connection of the resident may be disconnected“We simply put up a notice as a deterrent and have not collected any fine till date. The notice was put up as people have been bringing their relatives, friends and outsiders, whose health status we don’t know. They also misbehave with the guards. We have sent a communication to the district magistrate and sought his permission to implement the order,” Tyagi said.“But there has been no response till date. What do we do if the infection spreads in the highrise? ,” he added.The RWA of Gaur Green Avenue also said that they will speak to the district magistrate about the notice.“We have put up certain restrictions about entry of domestic helps and milk vendors. Some resident might have complained. We will speak to the administration,” said Deep Pant, secretary of Gaur Green Avenue RWA.A notice was also issued to Apartment Owners Association of Neelpdam Kunj. Office bearers of Neelpdam Kunj association said the notice might be due to an earlier letter issued by them, which was based on an “appeal” issued by CMO and the municipal-commissioner.In their letters, the two officials had asked the zonal in-charges to get in touch with the respective RWAs and councillor and request doctors and healthcare workers, working in Delhi, to restrict their movements to Delhi.“The matter was resolved after a detailed meeting by district magistrate along with Indian Medical Association u=in which we were present there. Our communication was withdrawn on the same day. It was based on an appeal issued by the CMO. We will approach the administration about the notice issued,” said Ram Tiwari, president of the board of managers of the association.District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey did not respond to calls and chose not to reply to a detailed query sent to him about the issue.The members of the federation of association of apartment owners said that they had written letter to the district magistrate last week and sought directions for entry or restricting activities of domestic-helps, plumbers, technicians etc among other points.“The Gautam Budh Nagar district magistrate had issued certain guidelines in this regard but no such guidelines have been issued in Ghaziabad. It is because there is no clarity from the administration, the RWAs or the AOAs are forming their own set of directions which are creating confusion,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ramprastha-colony-sealed-8-days-after-woman-tested-covid-positive/story-ks1QmUV2wMgNaPhfjlPVwM.html
11-05-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt invites suggestions on protocols for classroom learning after lockdown lifts||: The Delhi government on Monday invited suggestions from students, parents, teachers and school principals to develop a protocol for schools once they open after the Covid-19 lockdown.Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia said he will initiate a dialogue with key stakeholders of school education before finalising protocols. “We have faced challenges in the past; the difference this time is that the entire world is facing it together. Soon, we will learn to live with the coronavirus disease. Slowly, things will open up and so will the schools. However, this also means that new ideas of schools and learning will have to be scripted,” he said.The education minister said that the time has come to think out of the box. “For decades, schools had a set pattern, standardised classes, times, way of functioning. These need to be re-imagined now,” he said.The Directorate of Education (DoE) has also put up a form, through which suggestions can be made, on its website. “Students, teachers, principals and parents whose children are studying in schools can give their inputs. Respondents submitting practical and out of the box suggestions will be invited to share their thoughts with the Education Minister of Delhi through an online platform,” the Delhi government said in a statement.Sisodia will invite stakeholders from across the city for discussions in the next few weeks. “The dialogue sessions will be centred on how each stakeholder views the challenges and opportunities created by the Covid-19 situation, constraints we are likely to face in times to come and steps that need to be taken from now onwards to create an education set up that ensures equitable quality learning and well being of all children in post lockdown phase,” the statement read.Principals of private schools in the city said that the way schools operate will now completely change. Principals say that social distancing, rotational classes, regular sanitisation of the buildings and discontinuation of large gatherings, for annual day and sports days, will be the new norm when schools reopen.Amita Wattal, principal of Springdales School on Pusa Road, said that the schools will have to make major changes in the allocation of funds. “We will have to spend more on technology, buying licences of online platforms, sanitisation and hygiene. The schools will have to cut down on functions like annual events and sports day to avoid gathering and unnecessary expenditure. We will have to spend more on online training for teachers,” she said.Some said they will explore the possibility of holding both online and offline classes to avoid all students on campus.Manju Sethi, principal of Bluebells School International, said, “We will have to call students in batches only. We can’t call all of them at a time since it’s unsafe for them to travel in buses in a large number. For that, we need a blend of online and offline modes of education throughout the year. We will wait for the DoE protocols.”Experts say that the schools should hold have only one-fifth of the class strength on campus and rotate the students in batches. “This could be done till the vaccine is found or we are able to handle the peak,” said educationist Meeta Sengupta.However, if students were to be divided into multiple batches to ensure social distancing measures, completing the usual syllabus can be a challenge. “Schools could think of dividing curriculum into red, orange, and green zones and divide them into concentric circles, depending upon their importance. The division should be such that core syllabus should enable students to do self-study in non-core areas,” said Sengupta.On newer avenues for the education system, Sengupta recommends a community-based learning model where schools could function as smaller units, locally. “The Delhi government has already created a mohalla clinic model. They could think of something similar, like a mohalla education model where students could approach a parateacher or support staff to help them with their learning,” said SenguptaThe National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) is also preparing school safety guidelines to be followed when classroom learning resumes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-govt-invites-suggestions-on-protocols-for-classroom-learning-after-lockdown-lifts/story-TRDfSuoqpRHx7QXVhuS8KM.html
11-05-2020||Noida||Covid test results stuck after NIB’s machine malfunctions||Gautam Budh Nagar district is facing delay in getting Covid-19 test reports, following a technical snag in the sample testing machine at National Institute of Biologicals (NIB) in Noida. Over 100 samples from NIB have been shifted to the Government Institute of Medical Sciences in Greater Noida after the snag was reported.The district health department has been facing trouble in getting Covid-19 sample reports for the last few weeks. Following the crisis, GIMS was asked to develop its lab for Covid-19 testing, along with NIB. In the month of March and the beginning of April, samples were being sent to labs at Aligarh Muslim University, Meerut, National Centre of Disease Control and other places. Later, NIB and GIMS were roped in to exclusively test Covid samples for Gautam Budh Nagar district .Till Monday, the district had reported 224 Covid-19 positive cases and two deaths.In the last week of April, GIMS authorities had to face criticism after hundreds of samples were ‘wasted’ and most reports came out to be ‘inconclusive’.The inconclusive reports forced officials to collect samples from suspected Covid-19 patients a second time, leading to panic and restlessness among those who are currently under quarantine at various government centres in the district.On Sunday night, samples from NIB were shifted to GIMS, which led to delay in results. GIMS authorities started conducting tests from 6am on Monday, with a target of testing at least 250 samples. “We have received samples from NIB and are conducting the Covid-19 tests. We started testing from 6am on Monday because we wanted to complete testing of around 250 samples. Our teams are working round-the-clock to clear the pending lot,” said Dr Rakesh Gupta, director GIMS.Uttar Pradesh government has also given its nod to use the molecular labs of Sharda Hospital in Greater Noida and Jaypee Hospital in sector 128 in Noida for testing samples. These two were waiting for a final go ahead from the state government.“We have sent all Covid-19 samples to GIMS as our testing machine has malfunctioned. The problem started from Saturday evening. We are expecting that the problem will be resolved by Thursday and we will be able to conduct tests again,” said a senior official from NIB.Meanwhile, the family of a 55-year-old woman continued waiting to claim her body from GIMS mortuary till Monday evening, despite her Covid test result coming negative. The woman was a resident of sector 128 and her husband is a constable with the Delhi police. The woman had complained of vomiting after which she was taken to the district hospital in Sector 30 of Noida.Doctors at the district hospital suspected her of having the virus and her sample was collected. On May 6, the condition of the woman deteriorated after which she was referred to GIMS, where she died during treatment.Authorities were not able to hand over the body before they get her Covid-19 reports.“We will now be handing over the body to her family members as she has been found negative for the virus,” said the GIMS director.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/covid-test-results-stuck-after-nib-s-machine-malfunctions/story-YfIv6bmdEWQLQ3JcpzjliI.html

11-05-2020||City||Match the following: Projects needing workforce, shelter home inmates desperate for jobs||As thousands of migrant workers, many of whom have been rendered jobless by the nationwide lockdown imposed to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), continue to return to their villages and home towns, infrastructure agencies such as the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and the NCR Transport Corporation (NCRTC) are struggling to find the workforce needed to complete their projects in Ghaziabad.The district administration on Sunday said it has sent about 3,000 migrant workers to their respective home towns on buses and, last week, had sent another lot of 350 workers to Rajasthan. A majority of migrant workers were taken to shelter homes set up in the district soon after the lockdown was announced and they have now been dispatched in buses to their home towns.The officials, however, seem to have no plan at hand about using these workers for infrastructure projects, a move that could help address two crucial problems -- joblessness and workforce shortage.“Currently, we have got permission to restart work on the Delhi Meerut Expressway (DME) project but we have only about 27% of our workforce available for the construction of Phase 2 and Phase 4 of the DME. The workers who are at shelter homes can help with our project, provided they are ready to work and has the required skill set. We have proper arrangements to house workers at two of our bigger camps in Dasna and Bhojpur -- both have a combined capacity to accommodate about 1,000 workers,” RP Singh, project director, NHAI, said.The NHAI contractors, who require unskilled, semi-skilled and skilled workers, are presently hecticly searching for labourers, even in nearby districts of Aligarh, Bulandshahr, etc. “We require about 1,200 workers for Phase 2 of the DME project and currently we have only about 350. We are searching for workers in areas such as Bulandshahr, Bareilly and Muzaffarnagar. But most workers have returned to their home towns. We also tried to search for workers in Khoda, but that locality is sealed now. We will now try to contact workers at shelter homes. If they are willing and have the required skill set, they can be hired. We will get in touch with the district administration about this,” said Vinod Kumar, senior engineer (planning) from Apco Chetak, the concessionaire company taking up Phase 2 construction of the DME project, said.The NHAI said the ongoing lockdown will further delay the completion of the DME project and will overshoot its revised deadline of May 2020. The shortage of workforce has only aggravated the delay.Likewise, the work on the Regional Rapid Transit System project, being carried out by the NCRTC, will also be affected, though work has restarted at its casting yard.The NCRTC officials, too, feel that migrant workers can be gainfully employed by them, if they have the required skill set.“Covid-19 pandemic has impacted the demand and supply of manpower. While workers staying in shelter homes are looking for employment opportunities, employers are facing worker shortage after their regular workers returned to their home states. As such, matching available skill set with the demand is one of the challenges being faced by officials and any idea that can help bridge the gap is welcome and will help both the industry and workers,” Sudhir Sharma, chief public relations officer, NCRTC, said.Sources in NCRTC said they have restarted work with a workforce of about 1,000 and their numbers will have to be scaled up once construction picks up speed.District labour commissioner Rajesh Kumar Mishra said the possibility of such an engagement of migrant workers can be facilitated with the help of the district administration.“It is up to the workers in the shelter homes if they wish to work for these agencies. We have about 28,700 registered workers with us who work at different construction sites. Even agencies like NHAI and NCRTC have to get their workers registered with us. At present, there is no such mechanism wherein the workers sitting idle at shelter homes can be engaged. But the agencies will have to get in touch with district officials on how to go about engaging them,” he said.District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey did not respond to calls and messages, seeking his response on the issue.The Uttar Pradesh government had asked district officials concerned to get forms filled up by migrant workers, specifying their work experience and skill set. Using this information, the state government plans to build a database of about 20 lakh workers who can be provided with employment opportunities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/match-the-following-projects-needing-workforce-shelter-home-inmates-desperate-for-jobs/story-UiES5dYXkOO0qGbg0lUZCL.html

Authority officials said that these commercial activities will be able to engage thousands of skilled workers and construction labourers. In 356 industrial units, a total of 24,220 employees will get work, while 12,186 labourers will be engaged in work at the various construction sites, the officials said. The authority hopes that allowing construction projects to resume work would help stop migration of labourers to some extent.“We have issued permission to the industrial units and housing projects to resume work as per the guidelines issued by the state government. We have rejected permission to those entities, which do not fulfil the laid down norms. The move is likely to engage construction labourers and skilled workforce,” said Narendra Bhooshan, chief executive officer of Greater Noida authority.Of 1,105 industrial units, which had applied, 749 were rejected permission to operate as they did not fulfil the conditions mentioned in the guidelines of the state government, said the authority officials.The industrial units have been told to properly sanitize their premises before starting operations, and they will have follow all standard operating procedures and social distancing norms. If any unit fails to adhere to norms, then it will be shut immediately and action will be initiated against the company, the officials said. Similarly, the real estate developers will have to sanitize their respective sites before resuming construction works. The developers can resume construction at those sites only where labourers are staying. Pankaj Singh, president of Greater Noida industry association, said that those industry owners who have got permission are engaged in the task of opening up their respective units. “Resuming operations after the closure of one-and-a-half months is not easy as it takes time to arrange workers and restart machines. Besides, the industries will have to face problems with restrictions at Noida-Delhi borders because many workers travel between the two cities. It will take time to come to normalcy,” Singh said. According to the officials, there are at least 60,000 migrant workers and dependent people, who are staying in Greater Noida.“If the migrant workers get jobs and food, then they will not need to go to their hometowns. We aim to allow operations at as many industrial units and construction sites, which want to resume work following social distancing norms,” said another authority official, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/greater-noida-allows-356-industries-91-housing-projects-to-resume-operations-36-000-workers-to-be-engaged/story-MYdKGdMb11KePD0hXKH9vK.html
11-05-2020||Delhi||Students write to state govts seeking financial assistance to pay rents||: A section of students living in rented accommodations — private hostels, PGs and apartments — in Delhi have written to chief ministers of all 28 states and the principal secretaries of eight Union Territories seeking financial assistance to pay their rents. The students, part of a recently formed students’ group called Student Tenants’ Union Delhi, on Sunday sent emails to their respective states and union territories for help. The group has around 250 students residing in different parts of the city.“We are writing to you to draw your attention towards the plight of a large number of students who are finding it difficult to pay rents due to the financial instability that has been placed on them and their families due to the nationwide lockdown. Even after the lockdown is lifted, it won’t be possible for them to pay a bulk amount of rent for all the proceeding months, which fall under the period of lockdown,” the letter read.“The ministry of home affairs and the Delhi Disaster Management Authority has issued two separate orders, stating that eviction of any student tenant from their rented accommodation in any circumstances during the lockdown period is illegal. However, the orders does not mention anything about forgoing rent. Many students, despite the order, have had to face eviction threats and attempts have been made by the landlords to coerce them into paying complete or partial rent,” the letter added.The students said they understood that the landlords will incur losses owing to non-payment of rents, and have therefore requested the state governments to intervene. “Please have a dialogue with the Delhi government to compensate these landlords in a way you might deem fit,” the letter added.The students contended that an order issued by the Delhi government on April 22 — wherein it had asked landlords not to demand payment of rent for one month — will expire soon. “Wherever the workers, including the migrants, are living in rented accommodation, the landlords of those properties shall not demand for a period of one month. And if any landlord is forcing labourers and students to vacate their premises, they shall be liable for action under the Disaster Management Act, 2005,” the order had stated.Media advisors to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal refused to comment on the issue.Landlords are saying they will take full rent from this month citing the fact that the order was for last month. Students are really under stress. We had written to the Delhi government last week. Now we have approached our respective state governments to seek help. Till now Kerala and Chandigarh have responded to the requests and said they will take up the issue,” said Varkey Parakkal, a member of the students’ group and a Delhi University student.BS Vohra, president of East Delhi RWA joint front said they would welcome assistance from the state governments. “It will be better if the state government help students to pay rent to landlords. Some landlords completely depend on the rent for their existence. We have already requested the landlords to cooperate during the lockdown, if they can afford,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/students-write-to-state-govts-seeking-financial-assistance-to-pay-rents/story-ReaB970XuqNAn7737fFpxJ.html
11-05-2020||Chandigarh||SAD demands dismissal of Congress-led Punjab government||The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Monday urged Punjab governor V P Singh Badnore to dismiss the state government on grounds of breakdown of the constitutional machinery even as it condemned Congress ministers for browbeating the executive in the meeting of council of ministers.Addressing the media here, former minister and SAD leader Bikram Singh Majithia said the state cabinet should resign on moral grounds or be dismissed for refusing to acknowledge the head of civil services appointed by the chief minister. He also made it clear that the entire drama had been enacted by the ministers to safeguard their illegitimate loot at the cost of the state exchequer.Majithia added that the ministers took on the chief secretary because the latter had earlier pointed out in a pre-cabinet meeting that the state had incurred revenue loss because Congressmen were patronising illicit liquor, with special reference to Bathinda district. “A free and fair inquiry by a sitting judge of the Punjab and Haryana high court is needed to unravel the Rs 2,000-crore scam,” he demanded. The SAD leader said Karan Avtar Singh was handpicked by the government by superseding other officers. He said that the officer had always been given outstanding reports during the Congress regime, but had now turned “bad” suddenly four months before his retirement. “It is clear that the ministers have ganged up against him as he is the last defence and bulwark of the system,” Majithia alleged.Holding finance minister (FM) Manpreet Singh Badal solely responsible for the current state of affairs, Majithia said the FM had announced only a short while ago that the state was revenue surplus. “Now, he is stating the opposite even though the lockdown happened in the last week of March when the financial year closes,” he added.Stating that it was the people who were suffering while Congress ministers tried to bully bureaucrats to do their bidding, the Akali leader said Punjab had the worst mortality rate in the country as far as Covid-19 was concerned. He said even as the health system was in a shambles, people were being denied ration which had led to one suicide already.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sad-demands-dismissal-of-congress-led-punjab-government/story-nnVFgh4cZTWMacAAK8fBjJ.html
11-05-2020||Noida||Staring at heavy losses, realty sector seeks waiver on taxes, deferment of payments for a year||The global coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic that has entailed a nationwide lockdown since March 25 to control its spread has brought sales to a halt in the realty sector, stopped all business activity and suspended constructions for the last 46 days. The unprecedented crisis has prompted developers to seek a slew of relief measures from the Uttar Pradesh government and the Centre, without which, major developers Monday said, the survival of the sector itself would become a challenge. “Without a relief package from both the Uttar Pradesh government and the Centre, we do not believe that the business will survive in the post-Covid-19 days. The revival of this already crisis-ridden sector is a distant dream in view of recent liquidity crisis if the government will not announce quick financial help. As of now, we are focusing on survival and need immediate help from the government,” Prashant Tiwari, president, western UP wing of Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (Credai), a builders’ lobbying group. Credai is set to demand the postponement of land cost dues, waiver on taxes, waiver on stamp fee and other benefits in an interaction via video conferencing on Tuesday with the Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister for industrie Satish Mahana and principal secretary (infrastructure and industrial) Alok Tandon. The developers’ demands also include mortgaging unsold stock (ready flats), the reduction of interest on project loans, waiver of interest on land cost dues if civic amenities are delayed, a waiver on time-extension charges, financial dues delinked from occupancy certificate issuance, the postponement of financial dues on housing projects, a waiver in stamp duty for one year, the reduction of prevailing impractical circle rates (property cost at which flats or plots are sold) to boost sales, and a waiver on electricity charges for builders during the lockdown period, among others.Around 50% of total the 3.5 crore daily wage labourers, who were earlier employed in realty projects in different cities across the state, have lost their livelihoods and more may stand to lose jobs in the absence of a relief package, said a survey conducted by the National Real Estate Development Council (NAREDCO), another builders’ group. The same survey said this crisis will not only affect livelihood of seven crore (in the country) daily wagers and skilled or semi-skilled professionals, but also negatively impact homebuyers who have invested around ₹32.24 lakh crore in the real estate sector across the country. In Noida, Greater Noida and Yamuna Expressway region alone have an investment of around ₹50,000 crore, according to an estimate done by NAREDCO.“If the Uttar Pradesh government will not quickly address the crisis, then things will get out of hand. The UP government must declare one year after Covid-19 as a “zero period”. During the zero period, the UP government must postpone collection of housing land cost. Besides that, the government should not charge lease rent, stamp fee and other taxes for the period so that the sector can get a chance to stand on its feet. The ministry of finance should restructure business loans, reduce interest rates, reduce goods and services tax, simplify fresh loans, ensure handholding by banks and make way for last-mile funding from banks at low interest rates if they want this sector to survive. Realty has already lost ₹2 lakh crore in the past 45 days of closure,” said RK Arora, president, NAREDCO, Uttar Pradesh.In Noida, 20 builders have sought permission to resume constructions and Greater Noida has given permission to restart work on 91 realty projects. In Noida, Greater Noida and Yamuna Expressway region, around 600 ongoing housing projects owe the government around ₹40,000 crore in land dues. And they are repeatedly failing to repay land cost dues owing to a the dip in sales over the last two to three years. On repeated defaults, these three authorities are imposing compound interest that can go up to 20%. And now the Covid-19 crisis has further aggravated the financial distress, developers said.“Our sales offices are shut, nobody can come out of their homes or purchase inventory, and construction sites are already closed. Labourers are leaving for their home towns. Covid-19 has made things worse for most builders who were already battling a financial crisis. And as the business is hit, all other dependent businesses such as supply of labour, construction material, and small scale industries are suffering. The UP government should give us a year’s time to finish construction and deliver projects. Along with the time extension, the government should also defer payment of all kinds,” said Amit Modi, vice-president, Credai.Industries minister Satish Mahana said the government will extend the zero period sought by developers. “The UP government will certainly give a zero period as the real estate sector was affected due to Covid-19 pandemic as all activities including construction remained shut. The government is seriously considering all demands made by builders because we do not want homebuyers, who have invested their hard-earned money to suffer. And the livelihood of labourers and professionals who are employed with developers and the survival of other dependent businesses are interlinked with real estate sector. Therefore, the government will address all issues being faced by them (developers).”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/staring-at-heavy-losses-realty-sector-seeks-waiver-on-taxes-deferment-of-payments-for-a-year/story-wi7H8fBuIm1zjK77Z9YbLJ.html
11-05-2020||Delhi||Digital farewells in the time of Covid-19||Earlier this year, Ritika Agarwal, a final-year undergraduate student at Delhi University’s Miranda House, picked out a purple saree for her college farewell, which was to take place in the second week of April. With the nationwide lockdown in place due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the 20-year-old had given up all hope of saying a proper goodbye to her classmates and teachers. Her juniors, however, had other plans.“We didn’t expect anything because of the pandemic. One day, out of the blue, our juniors shared an Instagram account with us. What we saw overwhelmed us,” Agarwal said.Through the Instagram account, the Economics department of Miranda House organised its first-ever virtual farewell for the outgoing batch, complete with activities, testimonials, Instagram filters, and dance performances.Bahana Saikia, president of the Economics Society, said they realised that holding a farewell on a video conferencing session with over 200 students would be a difficult task. “So we created an Instagram account with a virtual yearbook that had a small note on each of our 68 seniors,” she said.The group also worked on a customised Instagram filter with the departmental logo on a graduation cap and asked their seniors to put on their farewell outfits at home.Those who attended the four-day farewell, which began on May 5, said the filter was an instant hit and photos started pouring in the moment it was up online. “We asked our seniors to dress up since we knew many of them had already bought sarees for the farewell. With the north-east Delhi riots in February, followed by the Covid-19 pandemic in March, they were already stressed out. They didn’t even know that the last day they attended college would end up becoming their actual last day at college. We just wanted to do something nice for them,” Saikia said.The juniors posted dance performances and several photographs to the private Instagram account.“All of us were excited and kept waiting for the posts throughout the day so that we could comment on them simultaneously. When we were all asked to dress up, I video-called some of my friends and we even danced together at our homes,” Agarwal said. “This virtual farewell let us acknowledge our memories and talk about things. This might not have happened at the actual farewell since there is very little time and people are mostly engrossed in clicking photographs. The best part is that we can keep revisiting the page.”Miranda House principal Bijayalaxmi Nanda said that the college was also planning to hold a virtual Founder’s Day ceremony and graduation farewell programme towards the end of the month.Students from several other higher educational institutes in the Capital besides Miranda House, including Gargi College, St Stephen’s College, IP College for Women, Hindu College, and Delhi Technological University (DTU), have also been organising virtual farewells for their seniors.Like Miranda House, DTU created an Instagram account for the farewell of its outgoing batch. While the event was scheduled to wrap up by May 10, the account is still active as students continue to upload posts for their seniors.The account saw live artist performances, a DJ night, and messages from the university’s cultural council which organised the farewell for around 2,000 graduating students.“At previous farewells, students would have a Scribble Day where they’d write messages on each other’s shirts. For the virtual version, we created an online form to collect personalised messages for final-year students and create their own scribble-board on Instagram,” Bhavya Akhoury, 20, a member of the cultural council said, adding that they hosted performances on Instagram between May 8 and May 10.Pranav Gupta, 22, a final-year student at DTU, said, “It cannot be compared to a regular farewell but it did cheer us up during a trying time. The DJ night was a unique experience. We have organised multiple farewells and so we were expecting to have fun during our own as well. The most fun part was the titles they bestowed on us. They made customised posts as well.”The filmmaking society at Gargi College took things further and organised movie and game nights during the three-day virtual farewell celebrations, asking their seniors to follow the “strict no-casual wear policy.”Karnika Gupta, 19, said that for the movie night, the seniors decided to watch Bollywood flick Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham with the members of their society. “We were simultaneously dissecting the movie on WhatsApp and making memes. Next day, the four-hour-long game night was held over a video conferencing app since our society has only 24 members. We also recorded a video for them wherein each member recited a line of the poem written for them superimposed on photos.”But did these efforts match up to the excitement of a real-life farewell? Zara Khan, 22, a final-year student at DTU, said. “The event shone like a ray of hope during an uncertain time. Maybe digital is the way forward and this is what the new normal will be. The event gave us a chance to get comfortable with that.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/digital-farewells-in-the-time-of-covid-19/story-hQZg2Lbtgc2ZyRihc0YdXP.html
11-05-2020||Lucknow||UP: Liquor costlier, new excise policy starts on gloomy note||The Uttar Pradesh excise policy for 2020-21 came into effect from Monday, 10 days behind schedule, with liquor business starting to a low-key response. The new liquor prices, announced by the state government on April 6, also came into effect from Monday but vendors said the business was doing badly due to the lockdown.“Shops have opened but the lockdown is also in force and this means that customers are hardly able to visit us. Curtailed sales’ timings – by three hours – has also impacted trade. The increase in liquor prices too could deter some. The rush for buying liquor was seen on May 4, when liquor shops opened to long queues. Ever since, barring some centres in western UP, the queues have died,” a vendor said.“New rates have come into effect from Monday. Excise inspectors visited our shop on Sunday night to find out how much old stock we have left and told us that only new stock with latest prices will be sold,” a liquor seller, who had applied for renewal of his shop, said.“The excise department made it mandatory for new licensees, who took over the liquor business on Monday, to procure licences before starting their business, as against the previous practice of allowing them to function even as licenses were being made,” another liquor seller said.Many liquor sellers said that they plan to approach the government citing relaxation in minimum guarantee quota (MGQ) for country liquor as well as in the liquor licence fee, which has already been deposited for the entire year by nearly all shopkeepers. The government is looking to mop up an additional revenue of Rs 2,350 crore from the increase in liquor prices.For most of Sunday, excise officials were in their offices finalising fresh liquor sales’ arrangements as those sellers whose liquor licence expired on March 31, but were given seven days time to clear stock, would now hand over the shop to new licensees. “There are several renewal cases and all in all, from Monday, several new liquor sellers will arrive in the business,” an official said.The state government had set an excise target of Rs 31,600 crore for 2019-20, against which it earned Rs 27,323 crore till March. The lockdown started at the end of March and the six-week closure of liquor shops cost the state exchequer heavily.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-liquor-costlier-new-excise-policy-starts-on-gloomy-note/story-CMWQEKfoFFW1XIna1ktyAP.html

11-05-2020||Chandigarh||All arrangements in place, train returnees to be tested, quarantined: J&K principal secy||All set for the return of J&K residents stranded across the country, UT principal secretary Rohit Kansal said on Monday that arrangements were in place and the special trains would start reaching Udhampur from Tuesday.The inflow through trains was preceded by the regulated road transportation of the stranded persons via Lakhanpur and airlifting of Kashmiri students from Bangladesh.Kansal told HT that each one arriving in Jammu and Kashmir, be it by road via Lakhanpur, trains or by air is being tested for Covid-19. “Same procedure will be followed for those coming to Udhampur in trains,” he said.Two trains from Bengaluru and Goa, which are already on their way to J&K, will reach Udhampur on Tuesday morning.The UT administration has decided to allow arrival of only two trains in a day, keeping in view the handling capacity of the railway station and testing facilities at Udhampur.“While adhering to social distancing guidelines, the passengers will be ferried in state road transport buses, which would be disinfected twice before and after each trip,” said Kansal.Stating that a proper quarantine protocol had been put in place, the principal secretary said, “While some returnees will be sampled and tested in Udhampur, those hailing from Jammu, Kathua, Samba, Kishtwar, Doda and Kashmir division will be tested in their respective districts.”All of them will be sent to administrative quarantine facilities in their respective districts.Kansal informed that the administration has made an app — transit management information system —wherein records of all passengers will be available.“After deboarding the trains, details of the passengers will be uploaded in the app at the control room. It will have all their particulars, including information of sampling and results for easy and efficient monitoring,” he said.As per rough estimate, over one lakh J&K residents are away from home.“They include students, labourers, families and people working in various sectors. As of now, J&K has four modes of entry — by road via Lakhnapur, through Shramik Special trains, other trains and air travel. Irrespective of the mode, every single person entering the UT shall be tested for Covid-19 infection. This hasn’t been done by any other state or UT, but we are doing it to be doubly sure that the infection doesn’t spread into the community,” the principal secretary ensured.The Udhampur administration has created a fresh sample collection capacity of 1,000 per day for the train returnees.District commissioner Dr Piyush Singla said magistrates along with other staff members have been deployed to receive these passengers at the Udhampur railway station. Data entry operators have been deployed to guide the passengers about the process of online registration on the app.The nodal officer at the control room will get the real-time data for database management, which will facilitate the allocation of buses for onward journey of these people to their hometowns immediately.“Returnees shall be provided refreshment and water bottles at the railway station. We have earmarked a holding area with district-wise seating arrangements, proper shade and chairs. Sanitisation tunnels have also been established and sanitisers will be made available. Packed meals with water bottles will be served to these people ahead of their bus journey. Sufficient staff has been deputed to guide these passengers for registration and sitting in the buses concerned,” Singla said.Meanwhile, Union minister Dr Jitendra Singh said that the first passenger train that was scheduled to leave from Delhi to Jammu on May 12, will now depart on May 13.“This has been done to give authorities more time to make necessary arrangements,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/all-arrangements-in-place-train-returnees-to-be-tested-quarantined-j-k-principal-secy/story-gWvK0Zvt8FuD8PXYKbkDLJ.html

11-05-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh admn to test all incoming NRIs for Covid||All non-resident Indians (NRIs) returning to Chandigarh from abroad will be tested for coronavirus disease (Covid-19) three days after they have arrived in the city.“A confirmatory Covid-19 test and a 14-day quarantine in the city’s hotels will be mandatory for the returnees,” said a senior UT official, requesting anonymity.In the daily review meeting on Monday, Punjab governor and UT administrator VP Singh Badnore directed the health officials to ensure that all foreign returnees are duly tested.Officials have maintained that around 5,000 NRIs are expected to return to Chandigarh. But the number may vary depending on foreign approvals and Indian government’s capacity to fly them back.Most of these are expected to come via Delhi, and the rest from Amritsar and Chandigarh international airports.“Presently, we have not got any list of persons coming. But, on Tuesday and Wednesday, two international flights are arriving in Delhi. We are expecting to get more details about them soon,” said the official.In March too, around 2,200 NRIs and city residents travelling abroad had returned to the city. Notably the first positive case in the city was that of a foreign-returnee.CTU BUSES TO BRING BATCHESEven though two foreign-returned persons have already landed in Delhi, they haven’t been brought back to the city. They have been quarantined in a Delhi hotel.“Chandigarh Transport Undertaking (CTU) buses will be sent to Delhi for bringing back the foreign-returned persons to the city in batches. Till then they will be quarantined there,” said the official.Earlier on May 8, the UT administration had decided that all those landing in Delhi will be quarantined there and those landing in Amritsar as well as Chandigarh airports will be isolated in city hotels on payment basis.But the decision had to reversed after Delhi authorities on May 9 said they can’t keep them there for more than three days. 5 PRIVATE HOTELS SHORTLISTEDMeanwhile, the administration on Monday shortlisted five private hotels for quarantining the persons returning from abroad. “Hotel Lemon Tree, Industrial Area Phase 1; Hotel Fern Residency, Industrial Area Phase 2; The Piccadilly, Sector 22; Homtel Hotel, Industrial Area, Phase 2; and Hotel Regent, Sector 35; have been shortlisted. Their final confirmation is awaited,” the official said.Chandigarh Industrial and Tourism Development Corporation (CITCO) hotels - Mountview in Sector 10, and Shivalikview in Sector 17 - have already been declared as quarantine facilities.Principal secretary, health, Arun Kumar Gupta said necessary arrangements have been done to enlist a panel of hotels for accommodating the foreign-returnees.Badnore directed the UT officials that since the paying capacity of the returnees will vary, there should be a range of payment option.Meanwhile, Hotel Mountview premises have been sanitised and the staff has undergone requisite training for handling the guests. Hotel Shivalikview is also all prepared to provide the facility, said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-admn-to-test-all-incoming-nris-for-covid/story-0Oo5VYeuex6Oc6hKGLlwGP.html

11-05-2020||Delhi||Gas cylinder delivery man dragged for 50 metres while trying to recover cash robbed by three Iranians||A 29-year-old man clung on to the window of a Honda City car that dragged him for about 50 metres after three men, suspected to be Iranians, robbed him near the Chirag Delhi Flyover in south Delhi on Friday afternoon, police said.The desperate effort of the man, who delivers LPG cylinders, to recover his money did not go in vain as motorists on the road came to his help and blocked the car from escaping.Atul Kumar Thakur, the deputy commissioner of police (south), identified the gas cylinder delivery person as one Satish Pathak, a resident of Khanpur.“Around 2.30pm on Friday, Pathak was riding towards Chirag Delhi Gaon with gas cylinders on his bicycle. At a U-turn near the Chirag Delhi Flyover, three people, including a woman, pulled up in their silver Honda City next to him and asked him for the rate of a gas cylinder,” DCP Thakur said.When Pathak told them the rate, the woman allegedly pretended not to understand either Hindi or English and asked him to show him the amount.“When Pathak brought out ₹11,800 from his pocket, one of the two men stepped out of the rear of the car and snatched the money. He then pushed Pathak down and got back in the car,” the DCP said.But Pathak got back up immediately.“It was a lot of money to lose. I couldn’t let go, so I clung on to the car’s window and refused to let go,” Pathak said. “The man occupying the rear seat repeatedly kicked my hands, but I didn’t let go,” he added.DCP Thakur said the car dragged Pathak for about 50 metres, but he escaped unhurt by keeping his legs in the air.“Suddenly, I noticed a scooter rider pass by. I shouted for help and he parked his scooter in front of the car. Soon, another man parked his motorcycle in front of the car,” Pathak said.Pathak and the public cornered the suspects. The police soon arrived at the spot and took the suspects to the Hauz Khas police station where they booked and arrested them for robbery.The police identified the arrested persons as a couple and their male friend from Iran. “We are investigating if this is their first offence or if they have been involved in more such crimes,” the DCP said.The attempted robbery took place amid the Delhi Police’s claims that most crimes have dipped in the national Capital since the lockdown came into effect. According to their data, robberies and snatching dipped by 62% and 253% respectively between April 1 and 15, compared to the corresponding period last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/gas-cylinder-delivery-man-dragged-for-50-metres-while-trying-to-recover-cash-robbed-by-three-iranians/story-TvuxsotKTDqTbn5GB5fRxJ.html

After strangling his wife, the man walked to the Ambedkar Nagar police station and confessed to the crime. The police rushed to his home, where they found the woman dead on the bed.Police said the man, Vijay Sonewal, told them that he was angry because his wife, Hemlata, had stepped out of house during the lockdown. His wife’s family, however, alleged that Sonewal was an abusive husband and often got violent during arguments.Sonewal, an auto driver, had found his house locked and his wife talking to some people in the neighbourhood when he returned with food from a nearby eatery around 9pm on Sunday, said deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Kumar Thakur, quoting Sonewal’s statement.Hemlata’s family members on the other hand alleged that Sonewal used to torture her ever since their marriage in December 2018. They said that Hemlata had filed for divorce barely six months into the marriage because of the domestic violence and Sonewal’s abusive behaviour.“However, the court had asked my sister and Sonewal to resolve their marital discord by staying together. But Sonewal never mend his ways and the domestic violence continued,” said Hemlata’s sister Asha. Police couldn’t immediately verify if the case was indeed filed. Around 12.30am on Monday, Sonewal came to the police station and claimed that he had murdered his wife at home. A police team was sent to his home, where his wife was found strangled to death on the bed on the ground floor, said deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Kumar Thakur said.“A case of murder was registered and Sonewal was arrested. His wife’s body was sent to AIIMS mortuary for autopsy,” the DCP said.The police said Hemlata was Sonewal’s third wife while her’s was also the second marriage after her husband passed away almost five years ago. Hemlata’s eight-year-old daughter was at her maternal grandparents home when her husband allegedly murdered her after a fight.Asha said that her sister worked as a caretaker in a private school. “She had to leave the job because of her husband,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/man-kills-pregnant-wife-for-stepping-out-of-the-house-in-dakshinpuri/story-VESof7ONFd7BFf8n2PMPWI.html

The attack was speculated as militants have also targeted security forces in the valley on this day on several occasions in the past. Last year also, there were similar reports about the possibility of attack on 17th Ramadhan.“Keeping in view, the past experiences when militants chose this day to target security forces on this day, the security was beefed up in Kashmir,” a senior security officer said.Meanwhile, mobile internet that was suspended last week after Hizbul operational commander Riyaz Naikoo was gunned down by security forces at his village Beghpora in Pulwama was yet to be restored.Keeping in view the two attacks on the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) in north Kashmir’s Sopore and Handwara areas which left six CRPF personnel dead and more than five injured, the officials were apprehending similar attacks on CRPF.During a high level meeting in Baramulla last week, IG Kashmir Vijay Kumar had asked forces personnel, especially CRPF, to maintain vigil on ROP and Naka duties to foil militants bid to attack them.Meanwhile, additional checking points were set up on national highways and other sensitive places and messages were passed to security installations asking them to be on alert. Even the army’s RR units have enhanced the mobile patrolling in towns and villages.Meanwhile, the day passed off peacefully without any attack on forces in the Valley.2G INTERNET TO BE RESTORED AFTER RAMADAN 17 Top officials told HT that only once Ramadan 17 passes of peacefully that the 2G services could be restored in the Valley.Sources said that the government had decided to restore prepaid mobile phones on Friday night, however, during a high level meeting attended by top officials of security agencies in Srinagar, it was decided that mobile internet would remain suspended till Monday.“It was decided to restore internet only after Ramadhan 17, as there were inputs that security forces might come under attack on this day ,” the security officer said.Kashmir divisional commissioner Pandurang K Pole termed the suspension of internet as temporary. “The mobile internet will be restored soon,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/kashmir-on-high-alert-amid-threat-of-attack-on-security-forces/story-oggRon1DgmzqcixBHPVYnK.html

11-05-2020||Chandigarh||Schools in and around Chandigarh chalking out plan to reopen with precautions||Making use of odd-even scheme, combining online with classroom education, providing disinfectants and sanitizers at every point, and training on social distancing—these are a handful of practices that various schools of Chandigarh, Mohali and Panchkula are planning to adopt after the lockdown ends and institutes reopen.After reports that the ministry of human resource and development and the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) were planning to reopen schools, many heads in the region have written to officials for clarification.Niyati Chitkara, principal of Chitkara International School, Chandigarh, said, “The reopening of the school would require infrastructural changes. It should be done in phases with skeletal faculty and students to begin with.”Reema Dewan, principal of Delhi Public School, Chandigarh, said, “Calling a limited number of students, staggered recess timings, no functions and assemblies, thermal scanning, hand hygiene practices, and using masks, gloves and sanitizers will become the new norm.”“Schools will pose the biggest challenge in terms of social distancing,” she added.‘PARENTS WON’T SEND KIDS’On the other hand, parents remain sceptical. Nitin Goyal, president of Chandigarh Parents Association, said, “Social distancing is impossible even at 50% strength. Even if the schools open, the parents are not willing to send their children just yet.”The summer vacations announced in UT government schools will be over by May 14. Rubinderjit Singh Brar, director school education, said, “We could start with senior classes in shifts of 50% student strength subject to the approval of competent authorities.”‘WILL NEED GOVT SUPPORT’President of Panchkula Public Schools Association Piyush Punj said, “Already, schools are struggling with unpaid fees. To provide disinfectants, sanitizers etc, we will need some monetary support from the government.”Chandigarh-based Independent Schools Association (ISA) has requested the UT education department to allow a skeletal staff to visit schools to make videos for students.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/schools-in-and-around-chandigarh-chalking-out-plan-to-reopen-with-precautions/story-0PRVNY9mFh9Xo7mvW9LRJP.html
11-05-2020||City||Delhi records jump in severe cases, central team visits containment areas||New DelhiDelhi recorded 310 new Covid-19 cases on Monday, taking the city’s count to 7,233, according to the daily health bulletin released by the Delhi government. The death toll remained at 73 as no fatalities were recorded on Monday.The government had on Sunday mandated that all Covid-19 hospital send death reports at 5pm everyday to ensure the timely reporting of deaths. HT had earlier pointed out a discrepancy in the number of deaths being reported in Delhi government’s health bulletin and individual hospital toll count.The new cases bring Delhi’s doubling rate to just over 10 days from 13 days in April end. The number of people in the intensive care units of the city have doubled from around 50 persons in April end to 97 on May 11. The number of people on ventilators has gone up from disproportionately from just 5 on April 30 to 22 on May 11.Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung hospital said, “The number of people on ventilator going up does not mean that the severity of the disease is going up. We know that around 2 to 3% of those infected will develop severe symptoms and as more cases come more people will need ventilators. But why it has not gone up proportionally is because a person on a ventilator will not recover in just seven days and go home unlike those with mild symptoms.”“The doubling rate shows how much time it takes for the number of cases to double, which indicates the spread of the disease. We have to aim to increase this doubling rate. Although positivity -- or the percentage of people who test positive among those tested -- is a better metric of understanding the spread in the population, but it will only work when a lot of tests are being done,” said Dr Kishore. Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain had blamed the spike in the number of Covid-19 cases in May on reports of pending samples coming in. “The doubling rate of Covid-19 cases in Delhi has come down and the reason for this is that several pending reports – in thousands -- are now coming back,” Jain had said.Of the 5,031 people still with the infection, 1,623 are admitted to 10 designated Covid-19 hospitals in the city. Another 1,560 people with mild to moderate symptoms have been admitted to the Covid Care Centres or Covid Health Centres. In Delhi, 981 people with the infection have been put under home isolation, according to the data.The report shows that so far 2,129 people have recovered from the viral infection. The recovery rate of Delhi is over 29%, almost the same as the national average. It is much better than Mumbai, which has the highest number of cases in the country and a recovery rate of almost 19%.A team of central experts visited some containment area and a migration camp in Delhi on Sunday. “The report is being prepared,” said an official not wanting to be named. The Delhi government on Monday de-sealed A-block in Mansarovar Garden in west district after no new Covid-19 case was reported from the locality in the last 28 days.This visit is part of an ongoing exercise in which central teams assist the state in containing the spread of the disease. So far, 50 such teams have been sent to different states. The latest batch was sent to 10 states where the maximum cases were being reported -- Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-records-jump-in-severe-cases-central-team-visits-containment-areas/story-piapQrcfByhXCaaVpqk8aP.html

They will also mark their protest by wearing black ribbons on May 13 to highlight the plight of nurses employed under National Health Mission, Chandigarh.“On Nurses Day, the staff will observe two minutes of silence and light candles in the memory of those who died for humanity, while serving in the Covid-19 epidemic. We hope their families will be paid the insurance provided by the Centre,” says the official statement.On May 13, the union will protest to highlight the ‘exploitation of nurses’ by the government, said Amit Kumar, general secretary of CNEU. “The wages of contractual nurses under NHM are meagre as compared to those outsourced and the regular cadre who perform the same duties and have the same responsibilities,” he said.He added that the Punjab government had hiked the salaries of Punjab NHM employees by 18%, but the Chandigarh NHM employees have had no annual increment for three years.“A nurse under NHM draws just ₹9,000 to ₹11,000, while the outsourced cadre and regular employees draw ₹28,000 to ₹75,000 respectively.

Initially only two to three benches were constituted. But now 10 benches have been constituted and only those cases where the court thinks some urgency is involved, are being allowed to be listed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-and-haryana-high-court-bar-association-wants-normal-court-proceedings-to-resume/story-ekfUZWWDy8oCS0l5Uf7FpL.html

The virus survives on gloves and masks for three days, they should be kept in paper bag for 72 hours. Besides, residents should also cut these in pieces before dumping, so that used ones are not reused by someone, said PPCB officials.As per officials, the board had also issued a public notice a few days ago to sensitise the masses about the correct usage and discarding of masks and gloves.Citing that residents have been dumping used masks and gloves as domestic waste, board officials said that this puts sanitation staff and workers involved in door-to-door lifting of garbage at risk of infection.The officials said these have to be dumped with the domestic waste but, separately, and residents should apprise the garbage collectors about the same.They said the gloves and masks, being collected from isolation centres and quarantine facilities, have to be treated as biomedical waste, but those collected from houses are domestic waste only. Member secretary, PPCB, Krunesh Garg, said, “It is a precautionary step to avoid spread of the virus through masks and gloves, which are used by residents at large.”Earlier, the municipal corporation (MC) had also issued directions to its staff to bury gloves and masks collected from houses in soil at the dump site.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/keep-used-gloves-masks-in-paper-bag-for-72-hrs-before-dumping-ppcb/story-QL6Kp1NenahpFT6sTph4xO.html

And some students of Deen Dayal Upadhyay (DDU) Gorakhpur University have shown these qualities in them as they have been feeding the needy, including rag pickers, rickshaw pullers and slum dwellers, ever since lockdown on announced to check corona spread in March.Shiv Shankar Gaur, 25, a student leader and a Samajwadi Chhatra Sabha activist, and his team of 8 students ensure food for the poor who can’t afford it on their own as they are jobless these days. Eminent people, well-off families and teachers make monetary contribution to keep the social service going. Sporting a red cap, kurta and Nehru jacket, diminutive Gaur, a law student, along with his team reaches out to the poor living under Dharam Shala overbridge, Tarang overbridge and in slum areas around railway station.So far, Gaur and his team have fed roughly 8500 poor people hailing from West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand, Nepal or other regions. Resources are limited and hired car of a team member is used for delivering food. For 45 days, the team cooked and served meal to the poor. However, from Sunday (May 10) onwards, the team started distributing raw ration as they no longer can sustain food preparation cost.They have set a target of distributing 100 ration packets daily. Each packet has pulse, rice, flour, vegetables and other essential items like soap and tooth paste. Food grain is enough to last two times.“In the last 45 days, I have developed an emotional bond with these people who also share their pain with us,” Gaur said. A positive change that Gaur has noticed in them is that these poor people have started wearing masks and washing their hands as the result of an awareness campaign that he undertook while distributing food packets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/feeding-the-poor-in-corona-times/story-4TCjODd2PYAekxOYnyyg2N.html

Unregulated movement of vendors who are not screened could exacerbate the epidemic, says the letter.Talking about this, CRAWFED chairman Hitesh Puri said, “When asked to show licences, many vendors with their vegetable carts who come to our sectors are unable to produce a licence. They are usually seen wearing protective equipment just for the heck of it. Their reusable masks and gloves are not washed. They keep their masks lowered which makes residents nervous.”Speaking more about the issue, Kuljinder Singh Sra, general secretary of Sector 33-B resident welfare association (RWA), said, “There are around 10 veggie vendors using the same permission slip to enter the sector. Many times they are found going into streets which have quarantined houses, that too without masks.” The RWA’s finance secretary, Nimit Gupta said he had informed the local police about it but no action has been taken.Many vendors were using fake licences said Vijay Chakarsal, president of Sector 41-A RWA. “The spellings of words such as vendors is written incorrectly in the licences they show me. They usually come here from Punjab side. I have asked them to stop coming at least until the lockdown is over but they couldn’t care less.”Kuldeep Singh Gill, president of Sector 21-B RWA said residents there too were facing similar problems. “Police must deploy policemen in civilian clothes to catch these vendors who enter our sector without permission,” Gill said. Meanwhile, UT officials said all vendors are screened when they come to purchase vegetables from the wholesale mandi being set up at Inter State Bus Terminal (ISBT) in Sector 17. Police officials, too, said that vendors were being stopped at nakas in the city and vehicles of those found without passes are being seized. As many as 227 people have been booked for not wearing masks since March 23, police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/fake-licences-no-masks-chandigarh-residents-body-complains-to-ut-adviser-about-veggie-vendors/story-tS19xraCi32bDXWiAQo8xH.html

Reason: Their 24-year-old son Rupesh who suffers from a rare disorder, Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS) commonly known as progeria. They want a safe shelter for Rupesh to save him from contracting the deadly virus as his immunity is very low due to his medical condition. This rare incurable disorder accelerates ageing process of children leading to premature death. Although the kids who are in the grip of this rare disorder die by the time they reach 15 years of age, Rupesh is one of the oldest living progeria patients. Ramapati, who is a rickshaw puller, claimed that despite several requests, no government support for his ailing son had been made available so far.“Covid-19 pandemic is spreading at a fast pace and has several cases in Prayagraj. A man, who had returned from Mumbai recently to Chatnag of Jhunsi locality, around 12 kilometres from our house in our Bahadurpur block has tested positive. It is a cause for concern for me as even a slight brush with virus can make him susceptible to the unthinkable,” he said.Rupesh’s mother Usha Devi also raised her concern about her son’s safety amid corona times. “My son has become very weak. The lockdown has left us penniless. If my son is not provided a safe shelter, he won’t survive,” she said.Social activist and managing trustee of Ashutosh Memorial Trust Dr Girish Tripathi, who looks after Rupesh, said, “If a room on the outskirts of the village in any government building is made available, Rupesh could be kept there till corona threat is over.”Meanwhile, chief medical officer, Prayagraj, Dr GS Bajpai said no special arrangement was available for such a case and that quarantine centres were made only for suspected Covid-19 cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-s-corona-death-toll-13-tally-of-infected-patients-773/story-aUUQqHUeIRCGnsur0wX26L.html

People have already faced a lot of problems due to Indira Gandhi Medical College (IGMC) being turned into Covid-19 dedicated hospital and now turning DDU into a dedicated hospital and shutting its OPD will cause huge problems to the people as people from within and outside the town visit these hospitals for treatment.CPI(M) leader Sanjay Chauhan said that more than 45 days have passed since nationwide lockdown was imposed but the state government still has not been able to formulate any concrete strategy to deal with coronavirus. Neither the government is able to conduct enough tests nor they have any concrete plan to quarantine the patients.Most of the districts do not have proper quarantine centres as many of them lack essential services like food and cleanliness whereas some quarantine centres in Chamba and Kullu districts and in Jogindernagar in Mandi district are in very poor conditions, he added.He alleged that due to the state government’s discriminatory attitude towards people who are being quarantined and allowing people to home quarantine, Covid-19 cases have increased in the state in the last four days.CPI(M) has demanded that Indus Hospital, Shimla should be turned into a dedicated Covid-19 hospital and to make better arrangements for quarantine at the local level. If the state government cannot provide quarantine in government buildings then arrangements should be made in hotels like in other states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/revoke-decision-to-turn-ddu-hospital-into-covid-19-facility-cpi-m/story-AGDweLt5iBEJA0794dbm0N.html

In case of any discrepancy observed during operation, boiler must be stopped immediately to avoid any mishap,” said instructions issued by director, boiler, SK Gupta.There are also general instructions issued in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, like regular sanitization of boiler premises, ban on chewing paan/gutkha and spitting in the boiler premises and mandatory medical insurance of all the staff working on boilers.UP, according to sources, is extra cautious in view of a massive boiler explosion in the NTPC’s Unchahar thermal plant in November, 2017. More than 30 employees working on the boiler were killed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/vizag-tragedy-fresh-on-mind-up-orders-safety-check-of-all-hazardous-units/story-YyF9c5JIhTxhKtOzHjokNK.html

The CM had assured him of taking care of it.Earlier, an audio clip of a patient also went viral in which he tried to expose mismanagement and inadequate treatment of Corona patients and lack of facilities, including timely delivery of food in isolation ward.Another patient Abid also released a video clip from the ward exposing pity condition of arrangements and made an appeal to authorities to improve facilities. Meanwhile, in view of the increasing cases of corona here, the state government has sent a team of Dr Suryakant and Dr Vivek Kumar to take stock of the situation.“The team discussed various issues at length for improvement of existing facilities and we were working on their suggestions”, said Dr Gupta. The district has witnessed 14 deaths due to coronavirus and the total cases has risen to 245 out of which 139 cases were registered only in 10 days of May against 106 cases during entire month of April.While five persons died of Covid-19 during April, nine patients lost their lives in first 10 days of May, which triggered an alarm for health officials and the district administration.Meanwhile, the state government also has authorized 10 private hospitals for treatment of Covid-19 patients in order to ease the burden of treatment on government hospitals.Dr Gupta said, “It is a good decision and let’s see how they come up with their plan for providing treatment.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/cctvs-installed-in-ward-after-videos-of-apathy-surface-in-meerut/story-oMizko2xlE4vEQicjrnJFK.html
11-05-2020||Lucknow||Former BSP MP arrested on extortion charges||Former Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) MP Dhananjay Singh was arrested on Monday in connection with alleged kidnapping of an Uttar Pradesh Jal Nigam (UPJN) project manager with the intent to grab a contract of material supply in construction of sewage treatment plant (STP) in Jaunpur, said police officials.Superintendent of police (SP) of Jaunpur, Ashok Kumar-III said the former MP was arrested from his house under Line Bazaar police station limits early morning on Monday and sent to 14-day judicial custody by a court of chief judicial magistrate.UPJN project manager Abhinav Singhal had registered a case against him at Line Bazaar police station on Sunday night.“Along with former MP, his aide Vikram Singh and two other unidentified persons, involved in kidnapping the project manager have also been named in the FIR registered under Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections 364 (kidnapping with intent to murder), 386 (extortion by putting person’s life under threat), 504 (insult with intent to provoke breach of peace) and 506 (criminal intimidation),” said another police official associated with the case.According to the FIR, Singhal alleged that the former MP’s aide Vikram Singh was randomly calling him on his mobile number asking to meet Singh at his house since May 4. He said he had earlier met former MP before Holi when he was pressurised to allow contract for supply of aggregate sand used in the construction of the STP.“On May 10, Vikram, along with two others, visited the project manager’s place and forcibly took him along in a SUV to the former MP’s place. He was held captive there for over an hour and the former MP threatened him holding pistol in his hand as well as hurled abuses,” the FIR reads and added, “The former MP then talked to the UPJN MD Mohan Lal Singhal after which he freed the project manager after assurance on the contract.”“The material supplied by the former MP’s aide was of poor quality following which their supply contract was cancelled. The project manager stated that the former MP’s aides were forcibly trying to supply low quality material,” the FIR further stated.The project manager had apprehended threat to his life while registering the FIR.He was reluctant to talk about the case when approached over phone.He said he had been trapped in a net and unable to think what to do further in the case.The role of the mafiosi-turned politician is also under scanner in the killing of gangster Prem Prakash Singh alias Munna Bajrangi.Bajrangi was shot dead inside Baghpat district jail by another gangster Sunil Rathi on July 9, 2018. Bajrangi’s wife Seema Singh had alleged the involvement of the former MP by hatching the entire conspiracy from outside the jail and getting it executed through Sunil Rathi. The Central Bureau of Investigation is probing the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/former-bsp-mp-arrested-on-extortion-charges/story-cgjBOgqvSlEYKhHYZMx7dO.html
11-05-2020||Today's||Lessons from the migrant worker mess | Opinion||The much-maligned migrant worker lubricates the wheels of the Indian economy. We know his value when he is not available; then the machine grinds to a halt.Estimates vary but their numbers could be up to 120 million, more than the population of all but 13 countries. Periodically, the migrant goes back home. That is the day his or her value is recognised. The only question the employer then asks is, “How soon can you come back?” When the country was locked down to fight the virus, supplies of newspapers, milk, vegetables, groceries and medicines were ensured. Virtual schools and work from home policies gave a semblance of continuity. With additional free provisions and money transfers for the poor, the state seemed to take care of everything.BLIND TO PLIGHT OF WORKERSYet, the migrant, without a below poverty line (BPL) card, or any other ID showing his workplace address, remained invisible to the state. India is not alone in this blindness. Singapore is considered the development model for Southeast Asia and even China. When the virus travelled from Wuhan to Singapore, the migrant workers, living twelve to a room, with dozens sharing a toilet, suddenly became visible as the scapegoats.While the state forgot the migrants, the “poor” employers expressed their inability to pay wages without work and work was impossible during the lockdown. The master sat on his wealth, while the worker stared at his dwindling savings.When the lockdown was extended beyond April 14, the dam burst. As migrant workers trekked and crowded rail stations, the state woke up to their presence. Assurances of food were held out but the trust had been breached. Finally, the state agreed to run trains and buses for their repatriation.The master, complacent so far, suddenly woke up from his stupor. The state had allowed him to run his industry, but the lubricant was gone. The master pleaded with the workers to stay on; he asked the old question, “How soon can you come back?” There was no answer. Many returning migrants repeated to the press the harsh words used by employers when asked for monetary help to tide over the lockdown. They vowed never to return.FORWARD THINKING COULD HAVE HELPEDIt is easy to be wise in hindsight. Yet, the government could have visualised that the migrants will be stuck without income and will go away. The state could have allowed the industries to run, while other institutions, markets, and offices were locked down. While shutting off passenger transport, goods movement could have been permitted to keep the supply chains open.The workers could have lived in tents on the industries’ premises, enjoying better social distancing and healthier meals instead of existing cheek-by-jowl in slums, whiling away the days sitting idle and surviving on one meal a day.The state governments would have avoided the “no production, no taxes” conundrum, with enough tax revenue. But all that is hindsight.It is clear that the economy is sick and is likely to get sicker if course correction is not done immediately. The questions are simple: How to prevent the remaining migrants from fleeing and how to bring back those who have gone away? The migrants have only one goal: To feed their families through their labour, even far away from home for a wage which often is not enough to buy a cup of coffee at one of the popular international franchisees. Workers in the legal loop have been allowed provident fund advance but migrants are deprived of it due to the collusion of our inspectors with the employers. Can the state give them an advance for survival for a month if they report to work within a prescribed period? Can the employer pay for their fare from home? Punjab farmers used to form reception committees for seasonal agriculture labourers at railway stations. The banners promised, among other perks, free liquor! To be back in business, the industrialist has to take a leaf out of the Punjab farmer’s book.LIFE-BLOOD OF THE ECONOMYThe much-criticised US president Donald Trump allowed goods transport to run during the lockdown; he held a reception for the truckers at the White House, calling them “the absolute life-blood” of the economy. The US did not shut down industries. When some meat plants closed down due to the virus, Trump used the Defence Production Act to reopen them. He directed supplies to six companies, including carmaker General Motors, to shift to making ventilators and N95 masks!This is not the first time that a virus has come out of the wet markets of China, and probably not the last time either. These wet markets, where faecal matter and body fluids mingle with meat, are open again. Next time, we should close borders much earlier but not shut down our industries and goods transport.Production, consumption, and the resultant multipliers are the life-blood of the economy. Come what may, the economy should not be allowed to bleed dry.(The writer is a Panchkula-based retired IAS officer of the Haryana cadre and formerly chairman, Haryana Electricity Regulatory Commission.

11-05-2020||Chandigarh||Former Punjab DGP Sumedh Singh Saini granted anticipatory bail in 1991 abduction case||Former director general of Punjab police Sumedh Singh Saini was granted anticipatory bail on Monday by the court of additional district and sessions judge, Mohali, Monika Goyal,in a case related to the disappearance of Balwant Singh Multani, a Chandigarh Industrial and Tourism Corporation (CITCO) employee in 1991.Saini had moved the Mohali court on May 8, seeking anticipatory bail in the 29-year-old abduction case, claiming he had been falsely implicated because of “vendetta”.Being granted bail means he will not be arrested in this case. Multani, a junior engineer with CITCO, was allegedly picked up by two officers after a terrorist attack on Saini, then senior superintendent of police, Chandigarh, in which four policemen in his security posse were killed. The police later claimed that Multani had escaped from the custody of Qadian police.A case was registered under Sections 364 (kidnapping or abduction in order to murder), 201 (causing disappearance of evidence), 344 (wrongful confinement), 330 (voluntarily causing hurt to exhort confession) and 120 (B) (criminal conspiracy) in Mohali on May 6 on the basis of a complaint filed by Multani’s brother Palwinder Singh Multani.Former deputy superintendent of police Baldev Singh Saini, inspector Satvir Singh, sub-inspectors Har Sahai Sharma, Jagir Singh and Anoop Singh and ASI Kuldip Singh were also named in the case.Hours after he was booked Saini was stopped from entering Himachal Pradesh by the state’s police for not carrying a curfew pass. He was reportedly headed for his property in Karsog (Mandi district) in Himachal when he was stopped at the HP border at 4 am on May 7 and sent back.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/former-punjab-dgp-sumedh-singh-saini-gets-bail-in-1991-abduction-case/story-Q72O214KCyEVmwMb8ygDlI.html
11-05-2020||Chandigarh||Covid-19 positive truck driver reaches Uttarakhand from Punjab, detained at border||A Covid-19 patient, who had tested positive in Fatehgarh, Punjab, last week, was detained by the Uttarakhand Police in the Bazpur border area in Udham Singh Nagar on Monday.The patient is a truck driver. Officials are trying to figure out how he managed to come all the way from Punjab.A health bulletin issued by the Uttarakhand government on Monday stated that the Fatehgarh district commissioner had confirmed that a 47-year-old male patient had tested positive in the area on May 7.The district administration immediately isolated the patient at Susheela Tiwari Hospital in Haldwani and has started treatment as per protocol.Udham Singh Nagar chief medical officer Dr Shailaja Bhatt said, “We are trying to find out how the patient managed to come here all the way from Punjab. In the meanwhile, we have isolated him at the hospital.”“Another person, a resident of Nanakmatta, accompanied him. The patient’s companion has been quarantined at a health facility and his samples have been sent for testing again as he had tested negative on May 7,” said Dr Bhatt.According to officials, the truck driver was detained by police officials by tracing the location of his vehicle after the Punjab administration notified the Uttarakhand government.The Uttarakhand health department will not count the new patient in the state’s tally of cases.Public relations officer of the state health department JC Pandey said, “Since the patient tested positive in Punjab and not Uttarakhand, he is not being included in the state’s tally. However, he is being treated here as per protocol.”As of Monday, with nine active cases, Udham Singh Nagar has the maximum number of active cases in the state. The doubling rate of cases in the district (based on the average of the past seven days) was found to be 9.9 days, whereas the doubling rate in the state is 45 days.Uttarakhand has had 68 positive cases and 46 recoveries. At present, there are 21 active cases in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/covid-19-positive-truck-driver-reaches-uttarakhand-from-punjab-detained-at-border/story-4bSByLhrwPAfhhCMNms4hL.html
11-05-2020||Pune||Monday Musings: When will Bhavani peth yield on Covid-19 front?||Week after week, fortnight after fortnight, Bhavani peth-- the highly-congested, low income locality with as many as 22 slums in the heart of old Pune-- has dominated the coronavirus situation in Pune. No other part of Pune has been as badly hit by Covid-19 and is as worrisome as Bhavani peth. As of May 6, of the total 1,900 positive cases in Pune, Bhavani peth had 451- nearly one-fourth of the total and a good 104 cases more than the second worst-affected ward, Dhole Patil road.As of April 15, Bhavani peth had 96 positive cases, exactly twice the number of cases in Dhole Patil road, and almost a month ago, on April 12, 11 of the total 34 deaths in the city had occurred in Bhavani peth. While the whole of Pune is a red zone district, the most serious situation now stands limited to micro-containment clusters in five of the 15 wards, namely, Bhavani peth, Dhole Patil road, Yerawada-Kalas-Dhanori, Shivajinagar-Ghole road and Kasba-Vishrambaugwada. Of these, Kasba and Vishrambaugwada have begun showing a flattening of the curve, as reported on May 10, and of the three remaining wards, the growth rate in positive cases is not as high in the Yerawada ward as compared to the other two. The fact that the number of positive cases and deaths have been continuously rising in Bhavani peth indicates that the situation here is quite challenging. One of the poorest sections of Pune city, this locality is dominated by Muslims, Dalits, and the underprivileged labour class belonging to various communities. It has wholesale markets dealing in timber, hardware, grains and steel. The locality draws its name from the Bhavani Mata mandir and the other famous landmark is Phule Wada - birthplace of the revolutionary social reformer, Mahatma Jyotiba Phule, in the neighbouring Ganj peth. Health officials of Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) say that the situation here is very challenging because of the high population density. People live in extremely small houses and slums where it is difficult to maintain social distance. The summer heat makes it difficult to stay indoors and so, they are out on the streets. The situation is compounded with common toilets and the civic body has taken to cleaning them thrice a day to keep them sanitised. The poor people of this locality have become restless because of the loss of income brought about by the lockdown. Late reporting of cases from this area has meant two disastrous consequences: the spread of the virus in the community and a rising death toll as the critical cases could not be saved in the hospitals.With two months having passed since the first Covid-19 case of Maharashtra was reported from Pune, the city’s health authorities would certainly have a better understanding of the challenges of Bhavani peth today. There will be no relief for Pune till this locality is brought under control. abhay.vaidya@hindustantimes.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/monday-musings-when-will-bhavani-peth-yield-on-covid-19-front/story-gZqkceRFSS1xsP0jy2AvBO.html

11-05-2020||Bangalore||Karnataka CM to discuss Covid-19 issues in state with PM Modi||Amid pressure from the opposition to seek a special Covid-19 economic package from the Centre, Karnataka Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa on Monday said he will discuss all issues with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and put forth the state’s stand. “As Chief Minister of the state, I would clearly state our stand and suggest what needs to be done to the Prime Minister during the meeting,” Yediyurappa told reporters here. Asked whether he will seek any package, he merely said, “I will discuss about everything.” With the focus on boosting economic activities amid a graded exit from the coronavirus-induced lockdown, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will interact with chief ministers of various states via video conference later on Monday. This will be his fifth interaction with the chief ministers after the outbreak of the novel coronavirus in the country. Demanding that Covid-19 be declared a national disaster, a delegation of opposition parties led by leader of opposition Siddaramaiah that met Yediyurappa on Friday had asked the state government to pressurise the Centre to provide it a Rs 50,000 crore special economic package to help those in distress due to the lockdown induced by the pandemic. Former Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy too on Monday asked Yediyurappa to urge Modi to announce ‘COVID package’ for the state. He said people, industrialists and parliamentarians have generously contributed towards PM Cares fund for the fight against the coronavirus and Yediyurappa should remind Modi about lack of financial assistance from the centre to face Covid-19. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi will discuss with Chief Ministers of various states regarding coronavirus control and lockdown. In this meeting state CM B S Yediyurappa will also be present...he should urge Modi to give special COVID package for the state,” Kumaraswamy tweeted. Sating that the numbers reflect that Covid-19 is increasing in the state, Kumaraswamy said along with tightening medical measures, financial compensation need to be given to those who have faced losses. “A big state like Karnataka that contributes hugely to the centre by collecting taxes, should get package,” he said.During the meeting along with COVID package, Yediyurappa should also ask about GST amount,drought and flood relief amount that are pending, he said. Due to lockdown the state is facing financial distress and if there is no adequate assistance from the centre, controlling Covid-19 will be difficult,the JDS leader added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/karnataka-cm-to-discuss-covid-19-issues-in-state-with-pm-modi/story-RUHkOt2IxPPEZKA5k3ZqzH.html

11-05-2020||Mumbai||‘It could be murder’: Bombay High Court asks police to probe accidental death||The Bombay high court on Friday transferred an accidental death case to the local crime branch of Ratnagiri police after noticing that it could be a murder.“Prima facie, there seems to be some substance in the allegations made by the petitioner,” said justice Revati Mohite-Dere on the suspicion raised by Sheela Narkar, mother of the deceased, Sachin Narkar.On March 6, Sagari police station in Ratnagiri district registered an accidental death after Narkar was found dead in a car which he was driving. The local police claimed that Narkar’s car turned turtle and he died in the accident.His mother, however, approached the high court alleging that her son was murdered and his body was placed in the car to make it look like an accident.She pointed out that though Narkar was purportedly driving the car, his body was found upside down on the back seat, behind the driver’s seat. Besides, her lawyer also pointed out that the post-mortem report revealed that the deceased had multiple incised wounds, which could not have possible in the accident.Apart from these aspects, justice Mohite-Dere noted some other aspects which created doubts about the accident. “Prima facie, it appears that if the car had turtled in the manner as alleged, the car would have several dents and huge damage to the car,” said the judge. “The photos of the car show none.”Besides, the judge said, the injuries sustained by the deceased were only on the head and neck and there was no fracture of ribs as normally found in motor accident cases.Against this backdrop, the judge thought it appropriate to transfer the investigation to the local crime branch.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/it-could-be-murder-bombay-high-court-asks-police-to-probe-accidental-death/story-8iemOLKHusLBlJbhlw1yhL.html

Bhatia said four people, including the driver’s two-year-old daughter, had contracted the virus due to his negligence. “The number may further increase, as the three newly diagnosed patients have met others in the area,” he said.Bhatia said this incident is also a lesson for others who don’t follow social distancing norms or jump quarantine.“People coming from outside the state should religiously follow home quarantine norms. Even at home, they should stay away from immune-compromised, co-morbid and vulnerable family members,” he said.To deter people from jumping home quarantine, the Chamba district administration has also launched a naming and shaming campaign. Photos and names of those who jump quarantine are published on social media every day.Himachal Pradesh has witness a jump in Covid-19 cases with a total of 18 cases reported in last week, including one fatality. The number of active cases has jumped from one to 17, in one weekSo far, state has recorded 58 cases. including two casualties. The first case in the state was reported on March 20.Una is the worst-hit district with a total of 17 cases followed by Chamba with 12 cases.Nine cases each have been recoreded in Kangra and Solan, four in Hamirpur; three in Mandi and two each in Sirmaur and Bilaspur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/three-in-chamba-test-positive-for-covid-19-after-meeting-infected-truck-driver-over-drinks/story-OlzuGkQYbpNAM7EwJ4wYIM.html

11-05-2020||Mumbai||Cleaner air could bring down pollution deaths by 6.5 lakh in India: Study||If the low levels air pollution reached during the lockdown period are maintained, India’s annual death toll could reduce by 6.5 lakh, says a study by the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi, and two Chinese universities – Fudan University in Shanghai and Shenzhen Polytechnic.Restricted economic activity during the first month of the lockdown, which was the most stringent, saw a 52% average reduction in excessive risk (health risk assessment due to air pollution exposure) for particulate matter (PM) across India. The latest study also estimated a four-time decline in health risks associated with other pollutants.Researchers studied concentrations of six pollutants, PM10 and PM2.5, carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), and sulphur dioxide (SO2) between March 16 and April 14 from 2017 to 2020, in 22 cities across India. The study – ‘Effect of restricted emissions during Covid-19 on air quality in India’ – was published in the peer-reviewed science journal Elsevier Public Health Emergency Collection, earlier this month.“If this low concentration during one month persisted for a year, it would save the lives of 6.5 lakh people, which would have otherwise been lost due to air pollution health effects,” said Sri Harsha Kota, corresponding author from IIT-Delhi.A study by the Lancet Planetary Health journal, one of the first assessments for annual deaths due to air pollution, had recorded that close to 12.4 lakh deaths were attributed to air pollution in 2017 in India.In the latest study, researchers calculated the average annual concentration for previous years (2017 to 2019), compared it with the reduced average concentration during the lockdown, and analysed it for the rest of the year. “At the same time, we calculated the health risk in both scenarios using base-line mortality and population data to arrive at this conclusion,” said Kota.The pollutant measuring indicator – air quality index (AQI) – reduced by 30% pan-India, with a 44% drop in north India, 33% in the south, 32% towards the west, 29% for east, and 15% for central parts of the country, the study found.Among major cities, Delhi observed the maximum AQI improvement of 49%. The study used air quality dispersion modeling (AERMOD) for the National Capital Region (NCR) where they considered meteorological factors during the lockdown and compared it with unfavourable weather conditions during November 2019.“The results show that predicted PM2.5 could increase only by 33% during unfavourable weather. This means a significant improvement in air quality can be expected if strict execution of air pollution mitigation plans is implemented even if meteorological conditions are adverse,” said Kota.Delhi NCR was followed by Kolkata at 44%, Mumbai at 38%, Bengaluru (32%), and Chennai (28%). “Using simulations such as chemical transport models, we saw that cities in north and east India, with very high air pollution, generally persisting during this time of the year, benefited most from the lockdown. However, with the advantage of sea breeze, Mumbai witnessed maximum reduction across peninsular India,” said Kota.PM2.5 concentration reduction was a maximum across most regions, the study said. India witnessed a 43% drop for PM2.5, 31% for PM10, 10% for CO, and 18% NO2 during the lockdown compared to previous years. While there were negligible changes for SO2, a sharp rise (17%) was recorded for ozone concentration. Ozone, which affects climate, increased marginally (10-20%) across northern, western, and central India, but eastern parts saw a mammoth 89% increase compared to previous years.“Whenever there is a decrease in PM, ozone increases as there is more sunlight [photochemical] penetration through the atmosphere,” said Kota, explaining that various Chinese studies had similar results during their lockdown period.An independent expert, who was not part of the study, said the lockdown had helped identify new background air quality levels for different regions but cautioned about the surge in air pollution post lockdown. “The comparison with the World Health Organization (WHO) safe limits is not rational anymore, and we will realise after the lockdown that we can never reach the lowest levels of 10 micrograms per cubic metre, even if all anthropogenic sources are on hold. There is a need now for region-based air quality standards based on land-use pattern and socio-economic conditions,” said Dipankar Saha, former additional director, Central Pollution Control Board. “To boost the economy when the lockdown is called off, there will be a surge in emissions again but we must realise activities need to be opened up in a phased manner. Exceeding standards by 10-20% are acceptable but levels rising over 150% the safe limit will nullify all positive developments witnessed during the lockdown.” ‘NCAP needs to consider O3 as a secondary pollutant for city action plans’India’s National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), which seeks to reduce pollution levels by 20-30% by 2024 across 122 non-attainment cities, identifies PM as the primary pollutant. However, the study suggested that secondary pollutants such as ozone also needed to be considered. “China’s Blue Skies Project went through a similar transition. India is already showing the indication of higher O3 levels when other pollutants reduce. During summer months, the Centre should consider precursors to ozone when they talk about non-attainment cities, and in addition to PM, O3 has to be kept in mind while preparing action plans,” said Kota.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cleaner-air-could-bring-down-pollution-deaths-by-6-5-lakh-in-india-study/story-KbvzbebpYakX2MYpPz2smN.html
11-05-2020||Mumbai||KEM Hospital in Mumbai receives ICMR nod for plasma therapy clinical trials||The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has given its approval for King Edward Memorial (KEM) Hospital’s convalescent plasma therapy clinical trials. Doctors are hopeful that the therapy might be effective in saving more lives as the Parel-based tertiary-care hospital receives the highest number of critically-ill patients. The therapy involved injecting the plasma with antibodies of a recovered patient into an infected person to boost the latter’s immunity response to the virus. “We received the permission to conduct plasma clinical trials on Saturday itself but are yet to start the procedure,” confirmed Dr Hemant Deshmukh, dean of KEM Hospital. According to ICMR, 450 patients across India will be enrolled for the Phase-II trial of plasma therapy to see its efficiency. Four other medical institutes in Maharashtra — Sir HN Reliance Foundation Hospital (Mumbai), BJ Medical College and Poona Hospital (Pune), RCSM Government Medical College (Kolhapur) and Government Medical College (Nagpur) — have also received ICMR’s consent to conduct the clinical trials. To be able to conduct convalescent plasma therapy clinical trials, a medical institute has to receive the consent of four bodies —the hospital’s authority concerned, the ethics committee, the Drug Controller General of India, and finally the ICMR.Fourteen hospitals are also awaiting the ICMR approval to start the clinical trials. These include Bombay Hospital, Sir JJ Hospital and Kasturba Gandhi Hospital from the city as well as Apollo Hospital in Navi Mumbai. In the absence of a vaccine or a specific drug, plasma therapies have been tested globally, albeit in limited numbers, as a treatment for coronavirus patients suffering from severe complications.Dr Sanjay Mukherjee, secretary of Medical Education and Drugs Department (MEDD), said, “There is a belief among the medical fraternity that the antibodies developed among recovered patients may help in neutralising the Sars-Cov-2 virus, which causes Covid-19. Through clinical trials, in which plasma therapy is tested on patients after the requisite approvals, we can establish if the theory can be proved true or not.”In Mumbai, the first plasma transfusion was conducted on a 53-year-old patient from Lilavati Hospital. However, the patient died 10 days after the treatment, despite his condition improving initially. Earlier, KEM Hospital was the first civic-run hospital to run a clinical trial of Itolizumab — a drug used for the treatment of psoriasis — on critically-ill coronavirus patients. Within five days of administering the drug, a patient’s oxygen intake improved and he was kept off the ventilator.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/kem-hospital-in-mumbai-receives-icmr-nod-for-plasma-therapy-clinical-trials/story-oOfIOmQoZhZmIcU793CCMK.html
11-05-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai’s SevenHills, Nair hospitals to get more staff members for fight against Covid||The expansion plan of the civic-run SevenHills and BYL Nair hospitals, which was delayed owing to a staff crunch, has now gathered momentum after the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) hired additional medical staff.By the end of the week, the civic body will add 500 more beds at both of these facilities, taking the combined capacity in both the isolation wards of the two hospitals to 1,900. To help the two facilities in arranging private doctors for the centres, both Maharashtra Medical Council (MMC) and Indian Medical Association (IMA) have come forward.“We recruited 500 nurses for Covid-19 isolation wards, of which 175 will be recruited at SevenHills Hospital. Also, we have recruited doctors from medical colleges and private practitioners to run these two facilities,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner (health), BMC. The civic body also plans to recruit doctors from green zones of the state to deploy them at these two facilities.MMC president Dr ShivKumar Utture said that at SevenHills Hospital, 15 of the newly-recruited medical staff are consultant doctors and around 20 are MBBS doctors.To cater to the growing number of cases, the BMC had in the second week of April converted Nair Hospital into a dedicated hospital for Covid-19 patients. The civic body plans to start 800 isolation beds at the hospital, 50 of which will be in the intensive care unit (ICU) for Covid patients. However, until now, only 550 patients were being admitted at the Covid facility. After the expansion, the facility will have a maximum capacity of 900 beds.Similarly, in the last week of March, BMC decided to convert SevenHills Hospital into the biggest isolation facility in India with 1,500 beds. However, currently it has only admitted 825 patients at the hospital. After the expansion, the facility will get an additional 175 beds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-s-sevenhills-nair-hospitals-to-get-more-staff-members-for-fight-against-covid/story-YEuazKYMjFwCFRPspwfSXM.html

11-05-2020||Mumbai||Spotted: Deer inside home after crashing through ceiling, rescued||Crash. Bang. Next thing you see is a deer plopped down right in the middle of your home. Residents of a house in a Powai slum woke up with a start around 1.30am on Sunday after a deer crashed through a tin ceiling into their home. The incident happened in Mahatma Pule Chawl near Hanuman Tekdi, between Powai and Bhandup, close to the Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP)A seven-member rescue team, including animal welfare groups from Resqink Association for Wildlife Welfare (RAWW), Plants and Animals Welfare Society (PAWS-Mumbai), and forest officials rescued the two-year-old male chital, or spotted deer, in a couple of hours.“We are not sure about the cause of the fall, although there are several rumours. It is an unusual rescue,” said Jitendra Ramgaokar, deputy conservator of forest (Thane). “The deer fell from a height into the settlement located at the base of a hill. The animal was in shock for a while, and could not move inside Karan Parihar’s home (resident of the slum) for some time.”Following a safe rescue, the animal, which is found in the SGNP, was taken to the rescue centre. “The deer only had minor injuries on his hind left leg. A full check-up will be done, and based on the presence of its herd in the same rescue area, the animal will be released,” said Vijay Barabde, range forest officer from SGNP. This is the second such incident in a month. Another spotted deer fell from a hill and died, owing to impact, at Hanuman Tekdi on April 21. “In both cases, the animals were being chased by a predator and to save themselves, jumped from the hill,” said Aaba Kubal, a resident of the slum who informed animal rescue groups.Pawan Sharma, president, RAWW, said, “The deer found itself in a tough spot after a suspected chase from a leopard at a slum adjacent to the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Powai. The joint rescue was completed amid hundreds of slum dwellers who had gathered.”“On April 21, the deer had fallen from a great height, but in the latest incident it was a much shorter jump and the tin shed broke his fall,” said Sunish Subramanian Kunju, PAWS-Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/spotted-deer-inside-home-after-crashing-through-ceiling-rescued/story-WbQnedWL1FbzkjdHILQCcL.html
11-05-2020||Mumbai||Biggest one-day spike takes Maharashtra virus tally, toll to 22,171 and 832||Maharashtra on Sunday recorded a single-day jump of 1,943 coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases, including highest number of new cases —1,278 — in a day and 665 patients from the past few days as per the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) list, taking the state tally up to 22,171. Maharashtra also registered its highest one-day toll of 53 Covid-19 deaths on Sunday, which took the toll to 832. Mumbai crossed the 500-mark for Covid-19 fatalities as it recorded 19 deaths, taking its toll to 508.Of the day’s cases, Mumbai accounted for 875, which is also the highest the city has recorded in a day. Total cases in Mumbai now stand at 13,739. Pune recorded 402 new Covid-19 cases on Sunday, taking its count to 2,377.Besides Mumbai, Pune and Jalgaon recorded five deaths each; three deaths were recorded in Dhule; and one each in Vasai-Virar, Pimpri-Chinchwad, Ahmednagar, Aurangabad, Nandurbar, Solapur. In addition, 14 deaths were registered in Malegaon between Apr 27 and May 10. One person from Madhya Pradesh also died in Mumbai, the state health department said.As Pune city crossed 2,000 Covid-19 cases, the city municipal commissioner issued orders to close all shops, except medical stores and hospitals, in the 69 containment zones from May 11 to May 17. The order further stated that the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) will deliver milk and vegetables home in case there is a shortage in containment zones.Maharashtra has recorded over 50% of its toll in the past 12 days. According to the data of the Medical Education and Drug Department (MEDD), out of the 832 Covid-19 victims in the state, 432 or 51.92% of deaths were recorded between April 29 and May 10.Even as the mortality rate has reduced drastically from 7.12% on April 12 to 3.85% on May 9, the toll continued to rise. The Union health ministry, too, has expressed concern over the deaths in Maharashtra. State health minister Rajesh Tope said that besides comorbidities, late admission in the hospitals is one of the major reasons for the rise in death count.Tope said that aggressive behavioural changes and communication exercises need to be taken for removing the stigma against reporting Covid-19, which shall contribute towards timely reporting, clinical management, and reduction in fatality rates. The minister said that around 30% of the deaths reportedly occurred between 24 to 48 hours of admission to the hospital.“Comorbidity, as we know, is the major factor, but besides that, people today are scared of social boycott if their community gets to know that they have tested positive for coronavirus. Therefore, they do not report despite showing symptoms. Addressing this stigma would lead to people reporting early for diagnosis and treatment,” he said.According to MEDD data, around 72% of the people who died had an underlying illness, while 28% of the people did not have comorbidities. The data also said that around 250 people are currently “critical” at various locations.The health minister accepted that the situation is “complicated” in Mumbai, which alone has recorded over 13,000 Covid-19 cases. He said that slum pockets in Mumbai are the problem areas where the virus is spreading fast.“The situation is complicated in the slums. If we leave Mumbai, cases are not much in other places. I accept there are issues in Mumbai. There is a shortage of beds and institutional quarantine facilities. We are trying to double the institutional quarantine facilities by adding facilities with additional 15,000 beds. The sheer volume is huge,” Tope said.Maharashtra health department will start implementing the new discharge protocol after a revised guideline was issued by state health secretary Pradeep Vyas. With the new guidelines, mild, very mild and pre-symptomatic cases admitted to a COVID care facility will undergo regular temperature and pulse oximeter monitoring and the patient can be discharged after 10 days of symptoms onset and no fever for three days in such cases. There will be no need for testing prior to discharge. At the time of discharge, the patient will be advised to follow the home isolation for further 7 days.According to the guidelines, the government said that the cases that are clinically classified as “moderate cases” will undergo monitoring of body temperature and oxygen saturation. “If the fever resolves within three days in moderate cases and the patient maintains saturation above 95% for the next four days without oxygen support, such patient will be discharged after 10 days of symptom onset in case of absence of fever without antipyretics, resolution of breathlessness and no oxygen requirement,” said an official from the health department.For severe patients, clinical recovery and one coronavirus test by RT-PCR after the resolution of symptoms is required as against two RT-PCR tests mandatory earlier.Tope said that the new discharge protocol would reduce the stress on laboratories in the state. “The new protocol says patients with certain symptoms can be discharged in 10 days. I had followed up with the Centre over the number of days before asymptomatic patients can be discharged. The labs are also burdened,” he said. Maharashtra has so far tested 2,38,766 samples. A health department official added that the revised protocol will reduce the burden on institutional quarantine facilities and other healthcare infrastructure.Dr Lancelot Pinto, an epidemiologist from Hinduja Hospital welcomed the move by the Centre. He said, “Basically the thought process behind it is that the swab can remain positive for a long time, but a positive swab does not necessarily mean that it is live virus. In cases of Tuberculosis too, PCR-based tests sometimes remain positive even two years after a person had TB. These tests are extremely sensitive. The RNA from a dead virus will be detected by the test and therefore, giving so much importance to the swab becoming negative may not be important. All of this in the context of the shortage of beds is also important. The guideline is just not for a negative swab. Once the patient is stable, just waiting for the swab to turn negative is not very scientific. It is an excellent move.” He added that if there is a necessity to remain in the hospital, nobody would remove the patient.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has convened a meeting with all chief ministers of the state via video conference on Monday afternoon to discuss the response to the relaxation in lockdown as per zones and further course of action.The state government on Sunday issued an order stating that Chief Minister Relief Fund would sponsor the train ticket fare of the migrant labourers that are stuck in Maharashtra and also for train tickets of the state’s migrants that are stuck in other states. As per the government resolution issued by the state, those migrants who are unable to bear the ticket fare for the ‘Shramik Express’ trains, the Chief Minister Relief Fund would pay for it through the district collectors. The facility will only be applicable for the special trains that depart till May 17, the order stated.According to the Pune district collector office, 1,172 labourers from Madhya Pradesh who were stuck in Daundh and Purandar talukas of the district were sent back to their state via the Shramik Express train on Sunday evening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/biggest-one-day-spikes-take-maha-virus-tally-toll-to-22-171-and-832/story-twjgKrsyoAWSi5jZ73NrjM.html
11-05-2020||City||Sion hospital wing in Mumbai’s Dharavi to get 100 beds to fight coronavirus||Taking the rising number of cases in Dharavi into account, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) plans to start 100 isolation beds at the Urban Health Training Centre (UHTC), a branch of the Lokmanya Tilak Municipal General Hospital or Sion hospital, to cater to Covid-19 patients in the area. Meanwhile, a section of Sion hospital will be converted into an exclusive Covid-19 treatment centre with 400 beds.Dharavi — one of the biggest slums in the city with a population of 8.5 lakh — has already recorded over 800 positive cases of the coronavirus. Being the nearest municipal hospital to Dharavi, Sion hospital receives a large number of patients from the area. Many Covid-19 patients are brought to the hospital at a later stage, when they are in critical condition. The new isolation facility in the area could help save more patients.On Saturday, newly appointed BMC commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal paid a visit to the slum along with additional commissioner (health) Suresh Kakani and ward officer Kiran Dighavkar, after which a decision on the upgrade was taken. “UHTC doesn’t have oxygen lines and we are trying to get beds with oxygen supply facility. We have started talks with our team of technicians. If it is not possible, we will start the isolation facility without oxygen,” said Dr Pramod Ingale, former dean of the hospital.Since March 25, Sion hospital has catered to 579 Covid positive patients and 212 patients suffering from severe acute respiratory infection. At present, the hospital has 221 non-Covid patients in the general medicine ward. “The hospital will get more isolation beds, to increase its capacity from the existing 250. Most of these beds will have oxygen lines for Covid patients,” said Dr Ingale. “The hospital already has more than 250 Covid patients, but we have decided to expand its capacity further, considering the growing demands of treatment. It will be done partially as the hospital also needs to attend to non-Covid patients,” said Kakani. Recently, the hospital has come under several criticism after videos showing bodies of Covid patients in the same ward as patients under treatment went viral.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sion-hospital-wing-in-mumbai-s-dharavi-to-get-100-beds-to-fight-coronavirus/story-qRWbYFDJA6ObUg24iFqgxL.html

This is the question the authorities at the Arthur Road prison in Byculla are struggling to answer amid the Covid-19 outbreak on the premises. So far, 158 inmates and 26 jail staff have tested positive.The jail, which was upgraded in 1994 to make it a central prison, has a capacity of 800 inmates. The spread came to light only when a 45-year-old prisoner, who had complained of high fever since April 30, suffered a paralytic attack on May 2 and was taken to JJ Hospital. His report, which arrived on May 5, showed that he was infected. The JJ Hospital team then tested 150 inmates and staff, of which 103 – 77 inmates and 26 staff – tested positive. Further testing of 200 more inmates and staff showed 81 more inmates are infected.The patients were reported in three of the 16-20 barracks, each with an area of 20ftx60ft. “Circle number 3 and 10 have been made quarantine centres to keep positive patients,” said a jail official, adding that the situation looks grim. “It is not possible to maintain social distancing within a barrack which was built in 1926 to accommodate 50 inmates, and now houses 200-250 inmates. We are sanitising the areas regularly,” said a senior jail officer.The jail authorities, however, said they had envisaged the situation much in advance. Nitin Vayachal, superintendent of Arthur Road prison, who has opted for quarantine at the house provided on the jail premises after his orderly tested positive, had written to all courts in the city to grant bail to inmates as early as March. The superintendent had requested the courts to give regular bail to inmates accused of crimes which are less serious in nature, and temporary bail to inmates accused in heinous crimes. A copy of the two letters, which is available with Hindustan Times, stated the jail authorities will not be able to control an outbreak of Covid-19 on the premises as it is “impossible to maintain social distancing with 2,700 inmates”.Ahead of the outbreak, a single judge bench of the Bombay high court denied bail to a 43-year-old man, suffering from diabetes, hypertension and high blood pressure, saying that a number of aged inmates are residing in the jail and they are more prone to the virus. The court noted: “The situation no doubt is precarious…If it’s true that more than 100 patients have tested positive in Arthur Road jail, it is for the authorities to arrange for their affairs and to ensure that the inmates are not infected by the virus.” Relief was also not granted to a 66-year-old inmate, who has now tested positive for Covid-19.The prisoners are panicking. The senior jail officer said the jail is now being run by the deputy superintendent with a staff of 70 jail officials who are put on day and night shift. “It was never easy to handle criminals on jail premises, and in the midst of a pandemic, it becomes tougher,” said the officer, who confirmed that there was clamour from prisoners for release on Friday night, with some threatening of hunger strike. Alarm bells had to be sounded and inmates had to be strictly instructed to get back to their barracks, said the jail officer, adding that extra manpower had to be called in.What’s the solution? The officer said: “Decongesting is the only way out. At least half the inmates need to go so that social distancing can be practised.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/184-positive-in-mumbai-s-arthur-road-jail-social-distancing-a-challenge/story-k4TZr2rk0tIjpLxGm4DRVO.html
11-05-2020||Chandigarh||Just 12 houses in Chandigarh’s Bapu Dham Colony account for three-fourths cases||The vulnerability of a congested area like city’s major Covid hotspot — Bapu Dham Colony — can be gauged from the fact that three-fourths (84) of 110 positive cases in the colony are from just 12 houses.Figures obtained from UT’s official data reveal that the remaining one-fourth cases (26) are from another 16 houses. Among these, the highest number of cases from a single house is 18. All these 28 houses are situated in four of the 20 pockets in the colony that has 2,500 multi-storey houses. These four pockets are completely sealed, and essentials are being provided to the families of those affected. Apart from those infected, 1,000 residents are under quarantine, of whom 64 have been kept in institutional quarantine outside the colony.Director health services Dr G Dewan said effective containment of the area was key to breaking the chain of infection. Yet, reports of people sneaking out of the area, despite claims of strict police enforcement and installation of CCTV cameras, continue to pose a challenge.Seven residents of the colony, working at a meat shop in Sector 28, left the containment zone and moved on rent to Sector 29. Even as police booked them and sent them to the temporary Manimajra jail, they did manage to sneak out from the “high security” area.Similarly, a man was found out and about in grain market, Sector 26, and was also arrested.RTI activist RL Garg said while residents were at fault for flouting norms, laxity in enforcement had also come to the fore. “Such carelessness may cost the entire city dear,” he said. Dr Rajesh Dhir, president of Chandigarh chapter of Indian Medical Association, said health teams had done well in screening all houses and sampling suspected cases, but residents should also cooperate and police should step up their efforts, completely seal outer boundaries of the area and guard these round-the-clock.INTERNAL MOVEMENT ON UNABATEDMovement within the colony in unsealed areas also remains unchecked.Area councillor Dalip Sharma said people were forced to head out for food or other necessities. “Even as the supply of essentials is erratic, there is a sizeable population with no resources to buy ration. Only a handful of people got free ration under the PDS scheme. Local authorities must distribute free ration among all households, so people don’t come out looking for food,” Sharma said. This was the need of the hour, he said, as daily wagers here were mostly dependent on the nearby grain market, and with restrictions in place, all their income sources had dried up. The councillor also raised concerns over the presence of a large number of labourers staying just outside the colony in the transport market. He said many of them were willing to go back to their home states, so the administration should work the logistics out.EVERY THIRD SAMPLE TURNING POSITIVEDiscovery of the Covid samples turning out positive cases is also on the higher side in Bapu Dham Colony.The UT health department has collected 300 samples since detection of the first positive case on April 24. Of these, 110 people have been found infected, which means every third sample has become positive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/just-12-houses-in-chandigarh-s-bapu-dham-colony-account-for-three-fourth-cases/story-aVGgA7uNY01WLw9JHrX1lM.html

This interest benefit will also be available on other expenses up to a maximum of ₹20,000 per employee for a period of six months, an official said.The state government, as per the cabinet decision, had also decided to pay up to 8% interest for six months on the loan amount taken from banks by the MSMEs.Officials said that industrial units whose electricity tariffs for March, April and May would be half of the average of January and February would be entitled to get a 25% rebate on the fixed charge. The remaining 75% amount will have to be deposited from July to December in six equal instalments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-to-pay-fee-for-loans-taken-by-msmes-to-disburse-wages/story-MR3gB12x6YmE42XdFTqdcN.html
11-05-2020||Chandigarh||Defying norms, Chandigarh schools prescribe textbooks of private publishers||Disobeying orders of the Chandigarh education department, Chandigarh Commission of Protection of Child Rights (CCPCR), Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR), most private schools in the city are prescribing textbooks of private publishers. In the last month, more than six complaints have been filed with district education officer by parents, yet the department has failed to initiate action. Books of private publishers are available only with select bookshops in the city, which caused huge rush and long queues, as the lockdown was eased in the city last week. The UT administration had first decided to let booksellers open without the odd-even rule, and later, permitted them to start home delivery. In 2018, the education department had directed schools to prescribe only NCERT books for all subjects except language and mathematics for Classes 1 and 2 and language, EVS and mathematics for Classes 3 to 5. It was also made mandatory for schools to prescribe and use only NCERT books taking cognizance of CBSE circular dated released in 2017. Moreover, there were similar instructions from the Madras high court and ministry of human resource development.The district education officer’s order on NCERT books was challenged by an association of private schools, National Independent Schools Alliance (NISA), in the Punjab and Haryana high court, which was dismissed on February 3.However, this has not been implemented in the private schools in the city so far. Nitin Goyal, president of the Chandigarh parents’ association said, “By ignoring complaints against private schools over prescribing non-NCERT books, the education department is supporting the nexus of private schools and publishers. The commission business is an open secret, and because of the inaction of the department, parents are now demanding for a vigilance probe.”Director of school education, Rubinderjit Singh Brar said, “We have issued requisite instructions to all recognised schools. We have no direct control over booksellers, but we do take action as per the complaint.” When asked about the status of the complaints, DEO Alka Mehta refused to comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/defying-norms-chandigarh-schools-prescribe-textbooks-of-private-publishers/story-oHtzYIwahyUgv3EgfQhEqJ.html

11-05-2020||Mumbai||Yes Bank case: Wadhawans remanded to judicial custody till May 22, court refuses interim bail||The special CBI court on Sunday remanded Kapil Wadhawan and Dheeraj Wadhawan to judicial custody till May 22. The court refused to grant them interim bail sought on the ground of spread of Covid-19 in jail.The two brothers were produced before the special court on Sunday after their CBI custody ended. As the maximum period for custodial interrogation was exhausted by CBI, they were remanded to judicial custody.Meanwhile, the defence lawyers for Wadhawan had moved the court for bail for the two on Friday. The CBI submitted their reply objecting the bail. On Sunday, the defence pleaded for interim bail considering the condition and spread of Covid-19 in the jail. The court rejected the plea for interim bail. While their plea for regular bail is now scheduled on May 13.The Wadhawans have pleaded that the allegations against them are not true and their arrest was illegal. The defence has claimed that all dealings are bank transactions, which are well documented. Hence, there is no need to keep them in custody.It further submitted that the segment in which Yes Bank invested, was oversubscribed by 2.37 times. There was no need therefore for any quid pro quo to Rana Kapoor, the defence has pleaded. Further, for the loan to Radha Kapoor, the brothers have claimed that there was enough security taken and all the process was followed by them and there were no irregularities.According to the CBI FIR, between April and June, 2018, Yes Bank invested ₹3,700 crore in short-term debentures of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd (DHFL), which is till date not redeemed. It is further alleged that Yes bank had sanctioned loan to RKW developers, where Dheeraj is a director and the whole amount was siphoned off by Kapil. CBI has alleged that in return, Wadhawan allegedly “paid a kickback of ₹600 crore” to Kapoor and family members in the form of loan to DoIT Urban Ventures (India) Pvt Ltd.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/yes-bank-case-wadhawans-remanded-to-judicial-custody-till-may-22-court-refuses-interim-bail/story-lKwHeBrKSy8SdFxraCGlKO.html
11-05-2020||Mumbai||Uddhav Thackeray to elect unopposed as Congress withdraws claim||With Congress deciding to withdraw one of its candidates from the upcoming legislative Council polls on Sunday evening, the elections to the nine seats will be unopposed. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray will be elected to the Upper House of the state legislature without an election being held. The Congress which seemed adamant on contesting two seats took a decision to contest only on one seat in a meeting held by senior leaders of all the three parties of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government — Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress. Rajesh Rathod will be the Congress candidate from the party for the polls. On Saturday, it had declared Rathod as well as Rajkishore alias Papa Modi as its second candidate. It is learnt that Congress took a step back after Thackeray irritated with the politicking sent a message through his party leaders that he will not contest elections unless it is unopposed during a pandemic. Monday was the last day for filing nominations. Congress leaders said that they took the decision following a request made by the chief minister. “We wanted the MVA to contest on six seats but for that, all the MLAs have to be brought to Mumbai for the polls. During Covid-19 pandemic, it would have created difficulties. The chief minister is also contesting the polls and he has requested us to make the elections unopposed. Considering all the aspects, we have now decided that the MVA will contest on five seats that would help in making the elections unopposed,” said state Congress chief and revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat at Sahyadri guest house where the meeting was held on Sunday evening.BJP is contesting four seats while NCP and Sena are contesting two seats each leaving one seat for the Congress. It is learnt that NCP chief Sharad Pawar and Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut called state Congress chief to ask him to reconsider the decision. Late Saturday night, Shiv Sena leader Milind Narvekar, a close aide of the chief minister, is also learnt to have met Thorat and requested him to withdraw a candidate. But, in a meeting held by senior Congress leaders, the party decided that they don’t want to withdraw their claim. Thorat, PWD minister Ashok Chavan, energy minister Nitin Raut and minister of state Satej Patil were present in the meeting held on Sunday morning at an undisclosed location. This irked the chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, who expressed his unhappiness in no uncertain terms. If Thackeray would not have contested the polls, he would have to resign by May 27 followed by his entire cabinet. Sena MP Sanjay Raut also told media persons on Sunday afternoon that the Chief Minister would not contest polls unless it was unopposed. “Do we tell people that while they are locked up in their homes; when there is a question mark over their livelihoods and health, political parties in Maharashtra cannot unanimously decide on an election? This would be a blot on Maharashtra’s tradition. Uddhav Thackeray never was and will never be interested in such politics. He is upset over this development. He wanted to contest only if it was unopposed. We are not scared of contesting, but this is not the time to contest elections. It is time to tackle the situation. We have taken this election out of no choice as the state was heading towards instability,” Raut told reporters on Sunday.He added that if there is voting on May 21, all 288 MLAs would have to come to Mumbai and it would not send a “good message” to the people of Maharashtra at a time when it is battling Covid-19.BJP used the opportunity to taunt the MVA over differences after Shiv Sena suggested the saffron party to reconsider its decision of contesting on four seats.“The BJP too does not have enough numbers to get their fourth candidate elected. It is their responsibility as well that election is held unopposed. They [BJP] do not have enough votes for their candidate; they would have to engage in horse-trading. They should also think if an election should be forced upon Maharashtra at such a time,” Raut said.Former BJP minister Ashish Shelar, in his reply, asked Shiv Sena not to drag them if their own ally (Congress) is not listening to them.“Respecting the chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and considering the current situation of the state, the elections should be held unopposed. This is the responsibility of the ruling parties. We have fielded candidates on the basis of our strength. Do not drag us if Congress is not listening to you,” Shelar said in his statement.Meanwhile, NCP has declared Shashikant Shinde and Amol Mitkari both seen as close to Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar as its candidates for the polls. BJP will field Ranjitsinh Mohite Patil, Pravin Datke, Dr Ajit Gopachade and Gopichand Padalkar for the four seats while Thackeray and senior party leader Neelam Gorhe will be Shiv Sena’s candidates. They will all now be elected unopposed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/uddhav-thackeray-to-elect-unopposed-as-congress-withdraws-claim/story-5UiQabXZv2gvMjwVidOfxH.html

11-05-2020||Delhi||Five migrants on their way home assaulted, robbed near Patel Nagar||Five migrants who were walking to Old Delhi railway station to try and catch a train to their hometown in Bihar were robbed of their cash and mobile phones by four drug addicts who assaulted them with iron rods and sticks and threatened to stab them if they resisted in the early hours of Thursday, the police said. Left with little hope of getting back home, the migrants decided to fight back, chased the suspects and caught one of them. “The robbers had left us with nothing. So, we thrashed the one we managed to catch hold of,” one of the victims, Vijender Kumar, said. The police later nabbed the remaining three suspects and recovered the robbed items, but they remain in their custody as case property.“We have returned to our rented homes and abandoned the plan of walking to our homes. A journey that earlier felt doable suddenly feels impossible now. We are afraid there would be many people waiting to rob us along the railway tracks,” Vijender said. The five men, who work in the furniture markets of Hari Nagar and Kirti Nagar in West Delhi, had heard about trains leaving for Bihar from Delhi stations. They said they hardly had any money left and were surviving on the food distributed at hunger centres. “We didn’t know that we had to fill forms to be eligible for the journey. No one told us that trains were departing only from New Delhi railway station. Since we always boarded our trains from Old Delhi railway station, we decided to walk till there,” Vijender said. “We had decided that if we didn’t find a train, we would walk along the railway tracks to our villages,” he said. Having packed sprouted grams and some beaten rice, the men began their walk in the early hours of Thursday.But when they neared a railway gate in Prem Nagar, close to Patel Nagar in central Delhi, they were intercepted by four men with sticks, iron pipes and knives, said Sanjay Bhatia, deputy commissioner of police (central). “The robbers beat us with sticks and rods and threatened to stab us if we did not hand over our phones and cash,” Bijay Kumar, another victim, said.The migrants lost ₹2,100 in cash, three mobile phones and their Aadhar cards. “I had kept my phone in my bag, so it didn’t get robbed,” Vijender said. As the suspects began to flee with the robbed items, the migrants decided to chase them on the railway tracks. “We had nothing to lose. So, we thought we would fight them, no matter the cost. One of the robbers wasn’t able to scale the railway crossing gate. We caught hold of him,” Vijender added. Soon, the police arrived at the scene and interrogated the nabbed the suspect, 21-year-old Amar. “Amar’s interrogation, the CCTV camera footage of the routes the suspects took while fleeing, and local intelligence helped us catch the other suspects too, including a 12-year-old boy. They are all drug addicts, DCP Bhatia said. All the stolen mobile phones and cash were recovered from them. “We provided the victims with food and stay for the night,” the DCP said. But the migrants walked back to their rented homes in the morning. “We haven’t told our families about the robbery. Instead, we lied to them that the police sent us back,” Vijender said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/five-migrants-on-their-way-home-assaulted-robbed-near-patel-nagar/story-hcyBnsOB73NsMcWEzAWtQM.html
11-05-2020||Delhi||Continuous server error disappoints Delhi migrant workers attempting to register on portal||Sia Shankar Rai (56), a migrant worker, has been trying register on the Delhi government’s website to go home to Chapra in Bihar for four days now.But he hasn’t even been able to access the portal. “It just isn’t working,” he said.Sia Shankar came to Delhi two days before the Janata Curfew on March 22 and now lives in Najafgarh’s Dhansa village. He has been coming to the Capital to work in the fields during the harvest season every year for nearly a decade now. “But I couldn’t earn much here this time and have run out of money. My family back home is also finding it difficult to make ends meet,” Sia Shankar said.He got his hopes up when the Delhi government decided to send migrant workers back to their home states last week, and more so when a train with 1,200 migrants left for Muzaffarpur in Bihar on Friday. Migrant workers are supposed to fill an online form on the Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board’s (DUSIB) website. Registrations began on May 4. Bipin Rai, member DUSIB, said, “They are supposed to enter basic details such as the number of family members, name of their home town, and others, along with their identity card.” But when people try to open the link, they said they are met with a server error.Pradeep Dagar, a resident of Dhansa village has been taking care of Sia Shakar Rai and 10 other migrant workers since the lockdown began. “We have been trying register their names in the list of people who want to go back to Bihar. But the link on the DUSIB website has not working for the past few days, and we can’t get through the nodal officer,” Dagar said.He added, “We have been giving them everyday essentials because they don’t have much money left. The government should do something for people stranded in various parts of the city.”A senior DUSIB official, however, said the registration process is on. “There are a lot of people trying to register at the same time on the weblink, which has caused some problems. Ever since we started the registration process, we have got 17,000 applications from families who want to go back to Bihar, which adds up to around 45,000 people,” the official said.When contacted, Delhi labour minister Gopal Rai’s office said the priority is to send those living in government-run shelter homes back to their native states.“Migrant workers who are living in various parts of the city and want to go home will be considered in the second phase. Currently, our priority is to send back those living in our shelter homes, and want to return,” an official at Gopal Rai’s office said.“Those who are not living in shelter homes will be informed by their area’s district magistrate about travel arrangements. Currently, we are sending people who are in our shelter homes on priority basis,” Bipin Rai said.While Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday urged migrant workers to stay back in the city, assuring them that there will be jobs very soon, people have been getting restless.A senior official with the chief minister’s office said that lots of people are applying to go back to their homes, that’s why there’s load on the server. Bhola Rai (42), who has a family of six to feed in Bihar’s Sonepur, said, “Our family needs us. We couldn’t earn much here. We don’t know what the situation will be in the next few months. We want to be with our families right now.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/continuous-server-error-disappoints-delhi-migrant-workers-attempting-to-register-on-portal/story-5eptULIU9IBZxSAHnUEYDN.html
11-05-2020||Delhi||‘Lockdown not indefinite, stay back in Delhi’: Kejriwal appeals to migrants||Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday urged migrant workers in the city to stay back, assuring them that there would be jobs soon, as lockdown curbs are gradually eased — a process that kicked off last week.“I am concerned with reports of migrant workers headed home on foot — with minimum food and water with them — walking for days. Some of them have left with children and elderly relatives. It is absolutely unsafe. I assure migrant workers in Delhi that, so far, we have taken care of food and shelter, and we are now doing our best to arrange for transport to send them home,” Kejriwal said.“But my first appeal for them will be to stay back. This lockdown is not going to be indefinite. It will be scaled down soon and the process has already begun. There will be jobs again. But still, if someone has no other option than to return home, I urge them to show some more patience. We have come across report of accidents on roads and rail tracks. This is concerning.”Delhi on Sunday recorded 381 new cases of Covid-19, taking the total number of cases in the city to 6,923. The Capital also recorded five deaths, increasing the city’s toll to 73. The government had, on Saturday, revised the time cycle for which it reports cases of the coronavirus disease. Cases are now recorded between 12am and 12am, instead of 4pm to 4pm earlier.In a video briefing, Kejriwal said a majority of Covid-19 patients in the city — over 75% — were either asymptomatic, or displayed mild symptoms and were either in home isolation or lodged in Covid care centres. The rest, as many as 1,476, were being treated in the Covid-designated hospitals across the city. Kejriwal said that of the admitted patients, 91 were in intensive care units (ICU), and among the 73 dead, more than 82% were above 50 years and had other health issues.He also said the Delhi government has roped in ambulances from private hospitals to make up for a shortage of the ones run by the state government. These ambulances will now cater to calls from both government and private hospitals, he said.Kejriwal on Sunday asserted that Delhi has contained the number of Covid related deaths and criticised the opposition for “politicising” a recent order providing hotel facilities for front line workers — such as health care staff, sanitation workers, police, etc – and announcements of financial aid in the event of their deaths.The Delhi unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) hit back, saying none of the party’s leaders had criticised any such government orders. Delhi BJP Manoj Tiwari on Sunday said, “Arvind Kejriwal should disclose the actual number of Covid-19 deaths in Delhi instead of talking about insignificant things to divert attention.” To ensure timely reporting of Covid-19 deaths in the city, the Delhi government on Sunday released standard operating procedures according to which all the designated centres for treatment of Covid-19 patients will have to send details of the deaths by 5pm each day.The SOPs released by the Delhi government on Sunday states that even if there have been no deaths, centres have to send a ‘Nil’ report by 5pm. Each hospital will have a nodal officer to ensure that the deaths are reported in a timely manner.On Saturday, Delhi’s health minister Satyendar Jain had assured that a single case would not go unaccounted for.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lockdown-not-indefinite-stay-back-in-delhi-kejriwal-appeals-to-migrants/story-bFgzCq8PgH3sffmtJ6OZFP.html
11-05-2020||Delhi||Covid-19 lockdown fallout: German man living at Delhi airport since March 18||A 40-year-old German man has been living in the transit area of New Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International airport for the past 54 days in a story not dissimilar to that of Viktor Navorski, the fictional character played by Tom Hanks in the 2004 Steven Spielberg film “The Terminal”.The German national, Edgard Ziebat, was on his way from Hanoi to Istanbul on March 18, the day India cancelled all flights to and from Turkey in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. Four days later, India stopped all international flights, and then, on March 25, imposed a national lockdown that is now scheduled to continue till May 17.While there were other stranded passengers at the airport at the time, what complicated things for Ziebat is that he has a criminal record in his home country, which has refused to take custody of him because he is at a foreign location, according to two security officers from the airport who asked not to be named. India, too, did not give him a visa because of his criminal record, the officers added.Watch | Will PM-CMs decide on lockdown exit & the man living at airport for 2 months There was no immediate response from the German embassy to calls and text messages regarding the development.On March 18, Ziebat landed in New Delhi from Vietnam in a VietJet Air flight  as a transit passenger to Istanbul, only to realise that all flights to his destination were cancelled, one of the officers cited above said.“After spending around a week in the transit area, with four other stranded passengers who arrived in Delhi on different dates — two from Sri Lanka and one each from the Maldives and the Philippines — airport authorities alerted their respective embassies,” the officer said.“While others were facilitated by their embassies concerned and were taken for quarantine, officials from the German embassy informed the Indian bureau of immigration that Ziebat is a wanted criminal in their country with several cases of assault and other crimes registered against him. Since he was on a foreign land, they did not take his custody. The Delhi Police and airport operator DIAL (Delhi International Airport Limited) were also apprised of the situation,” the officer said.He added that because India did not give Ziebat a visa due to his criminal background — criminal offences are taken into consideration when assessing individual visa cases in India — he remains unauthorised to leave the airport’s transit area. In India, an international passenger can normally stay in transit for just one day, and requires Indian visa to step out of this designated space for travellers passing through the country. The officer added that Ziebat has also not formally applied for an Indian visa.In the film, The Terminal, Navorski (played by Hanks) arrives at New York’s John F. Kennedy airport from the fictional Eastern European country Krakozhia, only to discover that the US no longer recognises Krakozhia as an independent country after the outbreak of a civil war, and Viktor is not permitted to either enter the country or return home because he is now stateless. He goes on to stay in the terminal for nine months because he can’t enter the US.Ziebat, too, has been staying in the terminal with only his luggage. The airport, in any case, has not opened to regular traffic since March 22, but is operating cargo flights and some special evacuation flights, and is currently involved in the massive repatriation exercise in which about 15,000 Indians stranded in 12 countries are being brought to different airports across India in the first week of the operation.According to the second airport official, Ziebat has mostly spent the last 54 days reading magazines and newspapers, talking to his friends and family over the phone, eating at some of the fast food outlets still in operation within the terminal, interacting with housekeeping and security staff, taking walks within the transit area, and using the airport’s washrooms and toilets. Authorities also provided him with a recliner, mosquito net, toothpaste, food and other basic essentials.“He told officials that he can manage his expenses. He sleeps on the beds, benches, on the floors, wherever he feels like. He is alone in the transit area as it is not being used because the airport is closed for passengers,” said the second officer.“We confirm that a foreign national is currently in the transit area of the international terminal of Delhi airport due to non-availability of regular flight to transit onwards. Appropriate authorities were informed about this in good time. They are in dialogue with the foreign national,” a spokesperson for Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL) said.HT could not immediately contact Zeibat for a comment.The second officer cited above said that around mid-April, some officials were worried about Ziebat’s health. “On this, some of the officials were sent to meet Ziebat and they found that he was fine, physically and mentally. He interacted clearly, and was in all his senses. CCTV footage was also checked, and nothing suspicious was found. Since then, some officers visit the German man regularly to interact with him just to get an idea of his well-being,” he added.During such interactions, the second officer said, Ziebat had said that he can pay for his tickets if his travel is arranged. “It was found that he has visas of multiple countries. The officials concerned have told him that it will only be possible for them to send him away once international flights resume,” the officer added.No date has been specified for when regular international transit will resume from India.The officer quoted above said Ziebat was asked to leave and go wherever he wants, but since no flights are operational, he has been stranded. “About a week ago, attempts were also made to accommodate him on a relief flight to Ankara (Turkey) but Turkish authorities turned down the proposal stating that the flight was only for Turkish nationals or for their permanent residents,” the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/german-man-living-at-delhi-airport-since-mar-18/story-VIJm8lsHTNxaws4mo99YDN.html
11-05-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt sets deadline for hospitals to report Covid-19 deaths||The Delhi government on Sunday asked all designated Covid-19 treatment centres in the city to send details of deaths caused by the pathogen by 5pm every day to facilitate the timely auditing of fatalities, and said action would be taken against centres under the Disaster Management Act if there are violations in the reporting protocol and deadline.The government also released a standard operating procedure (SOP) detailing when and how the death reports are to be submitted, and asked for a detailed written explanation in the case of delays. The SOP comes days after reports surfaced of confusion over coronavirus disease death numbers in the Capital, with doctors from at least two designated Covid-19 centres suggesting that more people had succumbed to the disease than was being reflected in the daily bulletins put out by the state government.It was not immediately clear if such a discrepancy existed, and if it did, what was behind it. The Delhi government denied any underreporting, and some state officials said that there may be a lag in the auditing and reporting process.“It has come to notice that both public and private hospitals are not reporting the deaths of positive cases of Covid-19 occurring in their hospitals in a timely and regular manner. It has further been observed that despite repeated reminders, the death summaries of the deceased patients are not being provided to death audit committee, resulting in incorrect or delayed reports being submitted,” said Sunday’s order, issued by Delhi chief secretary Vijay Dev.The government stressed in the SOP that its death audit committee for Covid-19 -- it was set up last month -- needs to audit each and every Covid-19 death daily to ensure proper reporting.Speaking to HT last week, a member of the three-member committee said on condition of anonymity: “The death audit committee goes through the patient case sheets, investigations, and death summary to include the death in the Covid-19 toll. The committee can report the cases as soon as all the relevant documents are received and this may take a while. Like, for example, the one death reported yesterday was of a patient from May 1. Yes, there is a lag but it is not deliberate underreporting.”Death numbers are critical in analysing the spread of the disease and its impact. With 73 deaths out of 6,923 infections in the Capital until Sunday, the fatality rate in Delhi is 1.05%, which is among the lowest in the country. Any anomaly in the numbers, however, could severely hamper the city’s fight against Covid-19 because all projections on infrastructure required to fight the disease going forward are based on these calculations.The new SOP says that even if there have been no deaths, centres have to send a “nil” report by 5pm. It adds that each hospital will appoint a nodal officer to ensure that the deaths are reported in a timely manner. The matter will be escalated to the level of state surveillance officer and then the director general of health services if the report is not received by the state Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) at 5pm.The three-member death audit committee will meet at 5.30pm each day to review the deaths that day.For centres that fail to send a report by 6pm, the nodal officer will have to report the numbers to the state health secretary the next morning, along with details of the deceased, and an explanation of the delay in sharing the information.These protocols will be applicable for both government and private hospitals. There is, however, no mention of how hospitals other than the Covid-19 designated facilities have to report any deaths at their centres.Action can be initiated under the Disaster Management Act if the protocols are not followed, according to the SOP. “In exercise of powers conferred under Section 22 of the Disaster Management Act 2005, the undersigned, in his capacity as the chairperson, state executive committee, DDMA (Delhi Disaster Management Authority) hereby directs that the reporting of death cases of Covid-19 positive persons from health facilities (government and private) in Delhi, shall be strictly as per the Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) annexed in this order,” the order read.The Distaster Management Act, 2005, gives various emergency powers to Union and state governments in the face of natural disasters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-govt-sets-deadline-for-hospitals-to-report-covid-19-deaths/story-g6dvyrClpVSWIxLRddCF7L.html
11-05-2020||Delhi||With regular services shut, many hospitals turn away non-Covid patients||AMIT RAWAT, 30, NEEDS SPINAL SURGERYAmit Rawat, 30, cannot sit or lie down because of an excruciating back pain. He was due to undergo a spinal surgery, which was scheduled to take place right before routine services at Delhi’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) were stopped due to the coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak.“I have been under the care of neurosurgeons from AIIMS since August last year. I was advised a surgery and got a date for February. However, it was later deferred to March. But the lockdown was enforced by then and I could not get the surgery done,” Rawat told HT.He received tele-consultation and was asked to continue taking the painkillers he had been prescribed.But the pain worsened, and he was rushed to the AIIMS emergency department on May 2.“The doctors there told me that I would not die if I did not get the surgery. While that may be the case, I am in so much pain. The medicines let me sleep only for half an hour before the pain gets unbearable again. And, the drug store nearby even refused to give me the medicines once saying that I had been on them for too long and it might affect my kidneys,” he said.When he asked for a date for the surgery during another tele-consultation on Friday, he was told to come back to the neurosurgery department when the services resume. “Routine services have been halted for the moment because of Covid-19. However, if someone has an acute problem, then they can always come to the hospital emergency and any required procedure will be done. However, we have to trust the opinion of the doctor, which might be different from the perception of the patient. The other option is to seek their doctor’s opinion via teleconsultation and if the doctor feels that they do need surgery urgently then they can always ask the patient to come to the hospital emergency,” said Dr DK Sharma, medical superintendent, AIIMS.MEHFUZ ALI, 65, NEEDS DIALYSIS TWICE A WEEKMehfuz Ali, 65, is in kidney failure, and needs dialysis twice a week. The Laxmi Nagar resident went to Dr Ram Manohar Lohia hospital’s emergency department in desperation on May 2.He hadn’t received dialysis in nine days because private hospitals where he used to go previously refused to perform the procedure without a Covid-19 report, because another patient in the hospital had tested positive.“My brother took him to a hospital to get tested on April 24, but the sample collections for the day were over. The next day, he took him to RML hospital. You know how hard it is to travel during lockdown. We had to get an ambulance on both days, which cost us ₹4,000 in total. The sample was collected and they said the reports would be in by April 30, which means he would miss the April 28 dialysis session,” said Fouzia Raza, Ali’s daughter.But the family did not get the Covid-19 report even on April 30, so they started enquiring at other private centres for dialysis. “No centre wanted to take in a new dialysis patient. They were saying every slot is full. One of the centres asked for our names, and then refused. I think they probably declined because we are Muslims,” Raza said. With no alternative, the family decided to go to RML’s emergency department, pleading with them to either give his report or admit him for dialysis on May 2.“He was having breathing difficulties by then. Still, the hospital refused to admit him. Finally, in the evening we received his report, which showed he was Covid-negative, and took him to a private hospital in Patparganj for dialysis,” she said.“We try to take in every patient who comes to our hospital. However, there are a limited number of beds or dialysis machines that we have. So, in case we are at capacity, we even try to reach out to other hospitals that can provide the required care to the patient,” said Smriti Tiwari, spokesperson from Dr Ram Manohar Lohia hospital. SABEENA, 31, nine-months pregnantSabeena, a 31-year-old pregnant woman, travelled from Loni in Uttar Pradesh on May 3 for medical attention at a hospital near Jama Masjid. She was in pain and complained of blood spotting. “All her check-ups during the pregnancy had happened at that hospital, so we wanted to take her there despite the lockdown. However, when we reached Delhi, doctors told us that some people in the hospital had tested positive for Covid-19 and they could not admit her,” said Asim Ali, her husband.They were asked to go to a hospital in Shahdara. “We had taken an auto from home, and it dropped us to the hospital, but left soon after. However, doctors there kept asking us to go back to the first hospital. We did not know what to do,” he said. He then contacted a volunteer with a local NGO, who took them to Lady Hardinge Medical College in his car.Even there, the doctors said they could not admit her as she had not been undergoing her ante-natal check-ups with them. “It was only after the volunteer requested the doctors that they admitted her. By then, she was in a very bad condition,” Ali said. They had left home at 4pm and Sabina was admitted to a hospital only at 11.30pm. “We do not deny admission to anyone, but yes there might be some delays when it comes to deliveries. This is because we have 91 beds in the ‘orange’ section where those suspected to have Covid-19 are admitted and all precautions such as doctors wearing PPE kits are taken. However, these beds are always at 100% capacity and we cannot admit more than one patient on each bed like it used to happen before because social distancing has to be maintained,” said Dr NN Mathur, director, Lady Hardinge Medical College.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/with-regular-services-shut-many-hospitals-turn-away-non-covid-patients/story-Oc6L1WagOhSeqVcbGF7r4H.html
11-05-2020||Delhi||When work from home is a matter of life and death||Every time Abdul Mabood gets a call on his mobile, he rushes to a room upstairs at his south Delhi home and shuts the door from inside as his wife and daughter watch in consternation. And he remains in the room, sometimes for a couple of hours, calmly listening to the caller, often only speaking lines such as ‘yes, ‘you are right’, ‘I completely understand your feelings’. Mabood is founder of Snehi, a Delhi-based suicide prevention helpline, and these days with his office closed due to lockdown, he is having to take many distress calls at home.“The number of calls has gone up five times in past one-and-a-half-month, and some of them can be emotionally wrenching. Working from home is not so simple when your job is to counsel those on the brink,” says Mabood.Uncertainty, isolation, and economic despair, caused by the Coronavirus crisis, have led to a spurt in distress calls to the country’s 30-odd suicide prevention helplines and those working for them—mostly volunteers -- are faced with a new challenge: how to maintain the confidentially of the calls, give a patient and undisturbed hearing to the callers and ensure their own families are not sucked into the vortex of emotions while they work from home.The nature of the calls to the helplines has also changed—unlike in the past when most were about relationship issues, exams, chronic illness and general financial woes, now they are about loneliness, isolation, fear of losing job, inability to pay EMI / rents, and issues related to domestic violence.“One of the recent calls was from a young IT professional. While she tried to juggle demands of work and home, her in-laws continuously accused her of neglecting them. She was pained that her husband did not support her despite knowing her situation. She was sliding into depression but did not want to discuss her problem with her old parents,” says Mabood.“In our office we get time to recompose ourselves before we return home. I try hard to maintain my emotional equilibrium as I take these calls at home, but my daughter is already complaining that I am not in a good mood these days, and do not give her enough time.”The volunteers working for these helplines come from different backgrounds, a lot of them from social sciences, and are trained to ‘listen proactively, and not be carried away by the call. Home with its many distractions, they say, is not the best place to handle such calls.“Working from home requires multitasking. But we have to remain emotionally invested in the calls we take. However distressing these calls, I cannot discuss them with anyone at home, not even with mu husband, ” says Vaishali Mahindra, who volunteers for Sumaitri, one of Delhi’s oldest suicide prevention helplines. Started in 1988, it is one of the 16 helplines that are affiliated to Befrienders India, the nodal body which coordinates the activities of its 16 member helplines across the country.In normal times, at Sumaitri’s office in central Delhi, two volunteers work in shifts—one answers a landline telephone, and the other ‘befriends’ visitors. “Our job is not to counsel people, but to befriend them, which means going into callers’ core feelings and making them feel we understand, thereby making a difficult situation more bearable,” says Nalini Malhotra, director Sumaitri. “Our volunteers’ work is more crucial during the ongoing Coronavirus crisis, given the country’s inadequate mental health infrastructure,” she adds. Rajesh Pillai, president, Befrienders India, says, some of their helplines are unable to function under the lockdown because the volunteers cannot reach their centres and do not have private space at home. “We have issued clear guidelines to our volunteers to create a set-up at home which is similar to the one at our centres where they take calls at landlines. They cannot be casual while taking a call diverted to their mobile phones. Our volunteers generally take call for four hours in a day, and we have told them to remain in one room during the assigned period, waiting for a call, and they should maintain the confidentially and should not discuss the calls with any family member,” says Pillai adding the calls to his organisation’s helplines have increased by 30 per cent. “ But I think this increase does not cover all who need help during the current crisis. Many people experiencing emotional stress may be unable to call the helplines because of lack of privacy as everyone in the family is at home”. Vishal Demla, an HR professional with a multinational recruitment company, who has studied Social Work, is one of Snehi’s volunteers. Managing calls at helpline’s centre, he says, has its own benefits. “If I was unable to handle a call at the helpline’s centre, I could always seek the help of a fellow counsellor, but this is not possible at home,” says Demla, who before the lockdown, would travel from Gurgaon, where he lives, to Snehi’s office in south Delhi to take call between 8 pm and 10 pm. “ Now during this time I remain shut in a bedroom at home while my wife sits in the next room trying to convince my relatives and friends to not call me during these two hours. ” Mumbai-based Aasra is one of the country’s first 24-hour suicide prevention helplines, and because of the lockdown, the number of its volunteers has come down from 26 to 6, crippling its ability to take 200 odd calls it gets these days. Many are have to be missed. “We are left with a small number of volunteers because not everyone has a private space at homes to take calls,” says Jonhson Thomas, director, Aasra.So, these days Thomas spends hours taking calls at home—not an easy proposition, considering he lives in a joint family. “Taking distress calls at home is difficult as there are so many distractions– the noise of children playing, of dogs barking, the doorbell ringing. You cannot talk to a person who is emotionally broken with such noises in the background. So, the backyard is the palace where I end up spending a lot of time these days,” says Thomas. Talking of the nature of the calls his helpline receives, he says most are related to the ongoing Coronavirus crisis. “The other day, there was a call from a woman whose husband has bipolar disorder. She was having trouble dealing with him as he was not taking medicines and getting aggressive, having remained at home for over a month because of the lockdown. She was worried he might physically harm her and children. The call lasted more than an hour,” says Thomas. “In many cases, people just need to ventilate to feel better. ”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/when-work-from-home-is-a-matter-of-life-and-death/story-V8J7RJXYZrT9Ml54060NwK.html
11-05-2020||Delhi||Delhi doctors employ oxygen treatment to keep Covid patients off ventilators||Giving oxygen, after making patients afflicted with severe coronavirus disease (Covid-19) lie flat on their stomach, helps in improving the oxygen saturation in the blood and boost recovery without ventilation, critical care experts treating patients in the intensive care units have observed. Oxygen saturation refers to the extent to which haemoglobin is saturated with oxygen.The patients are oxygenated while lying on their stomach for around two hours, then they are given oxygen while being made to lie on both their sides for one hour each and finally on their back for another hour, before repeating the cycle.“This method — known as Awake Proning — is used on patients whose oxygen saturation level is low. When the patient is in a prone position, the fluid in their lungs shift, helping them breathe better. We have seen dramatic results – with oxygen saturation in patients increasing from 87% to 95% after a session (normal oxygen saturation is 95% to 100%). With such results, we prevent people from going on a ventilator,” said Dr Amit Kohli, intensive care specialist from Lok Nayak hospital, which is handling the highest number and most serious Covid-19 cases in the city.Providing high flow oxygen through the nose or breathing masks has also helped in keeping people off ventilators.“If you see the ratio of people on ventilators, it is not that much. This is because most Covid-19 patients in respiratory distress seem to be responding well to various other techniques of oxygenation,” said Dr Kohli.Of the 4,781 people who currently have the viral infection in Delhi, 91 are in intensive care unit with only 27 — less than 5% — are on ventilators. Across the country, around 1.8% of all Covid-19 patients are on ventilators.Most Covid-19 patients land up in the intensive care units with acute respiratory distress, with fast breathing rates of 25 times or more. A healthy adult breathes in about 12 to 20 times in a minute.“Around 3 to 5% of our patients also show gastric symptoms. Reports from other countries also suggest viral myocarditis or inflammation of the heart wall. We do not have conclusive evidence from India, but it can be happening here as there have been cases of young, generally healthy, people suddenly dying. Then, there are other unusual symptoms that have started showing up like the Covid Toe,” said Dr Abhijeet Kumar working in the Covid-19 ICU at Safdarjung hospital.Covid Toe is a bluish discolouration of the toes.“So far, we have seen Covid Toe in only one patient in the second week of illness. We still do not know the reason for the symptom, it could be lesions caused by thrombosis or blood clot. There have been reports from around the world about blood clotting faster in Covid-19 and we have started giving anti-coagulants (medicine to prevent blood clots) to many of our patients,” said Dr Anjan Trikha, professor of anesthesiology at All India Institute of Medical Sciences. The doctors use a Modified Early Warning Score scale to determine who might get these severe symptoms. Patients are graded according to their age, oxygen saturation, heart and respiratory rate, comorbidities — such as chronic kidney disease, cancer. The most common comorbidity in these patients is chronic kidney disease, the doctors say.The doctors also look at chest X-Ray or CT scan to see whether the patient might get severe symptoms. “In fact, the radiological findings can show up much earlier in pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. A patient might be very comfortable, but their X-Rays show damage to the lungs,” said Dr Kohli.Early intervention is needed as the symptoms can progress rapidly. “Death from Covid-19 may occur in five to seven days of a patients first developing symptoms,” said Dr Kohli.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-doctors-employ-oxygen-treatment-to-keep-covid-patients-off-ventilators/story-6BoGMs5TZqPW6zhNT7nMFP.html
11-05-2020||Chandigarh||Cheaper properties, costlier construction predicted for Chandigarh’s real estate sector after lockdown||As the real estate sector resumes construction activity after lockdown restrictions are eased in the tricity, it faces a sharp increase in construction costs and buyer despondency.Already struggling with sluggish prices in the pre-lockdown period, the realty sector is set to be hit by another wave of low demand and price corrections as home buyers are likely to struggle with economic uncertainty, say industry insiders.After the lockdown was announced on March 24, the real estate sector, like all other economic activities, came to a stand still. There were no property transactions, and registration of properties stopped as the government closed down public dealing except provisioning of essential and emergency services.“Even as most buyers are expected to adopt a wait and watch approach in the coming days, they can expect cheaper properties. The uncertainty in the economy, expectations of cheaper loans and price restructuring will keep most buyers on the sidelines,” said Rakesh Kerwell, ex-director (north) of DLF.At the same time, for developers, constraints on project completion will mount.“There is a severe liquidity crunch in the market. Most projects in the tricity are construction linked wherein payment to the builder is made on the level of construction completion. With construction stopping and no new projects coming their way, builders are struggling with low capital inflows. This will impact the delivery of projects,” added Kerwell.RISING CONSTRUCTION COSTSMeanwhile, developers contend with the fact that costlier construction material will restrict steep price corrections in the tricity. Prices of construction materials like cement, steel, gravel, etc have increased by 30% to 50%. Some of these will have to be passed on to the home buyer, say builders.Harish Gupta, president of Builders’ Association, Zirakpur, said, “The price of a cement bag has increased by around ₹80. Before the lockdown it was ₹300, now it is ₹380. Prices of steel have increased by around ₹2,000-2,500 per metric tonne. Similarly, there has been a 50% increase in gravel prices from ₹21 per sq ft in early March to ₹31 per sq ft.”FEAR OF LABOUR SHORTAGEMore than 25,000 migrant workers have registered with the Mohali administration for returning back to their native states. “There is growing concern about construction getting delayed as migrant workers begin to leave the tricity. But with builders restarting work, more workers are likely to continue with work. Contractors are also urging them to stay back,” said Sanyam Dudeja, director of the Jubilee Group.In Zirakpur, builders on Sunday decided to restart construction on their projects. “Having sat idle for more than 50 days, labourers had started moving back to their native places. With the beginning of construction work, hopefully they will start earning their livelihood once again,” said Gupta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/cheaper-properties-costlier-construction-predicted-for-chandigarh-s-real-estate-sector-after-lockdown/story-kFDKoRijo1hyUEfYFoiTmI.html

11-05-2020||Gurugram||Woman raped by two men; one arrested||A woman in her late 30s alleged that she was raped by two men and threatened with murder if she reported the incident at a village in Sector 33, the police said on Sunday. According to the police, one of the men was arrested on Saturday night and the other is still at large.The police said that the arrested man was identified by his first name as one Vikram. He is in his 30s, from Rajasthan and lives in Gurugram. According to the police, the woman is from Madhya Pradesh and works as domestic help. She has known Vikram for the past one-and-a-half-year. The incident took place around a month ago when Vikram allegedly called her to his cousin’s room at a village in Sector 33.In the police complaint, the woman alleged that when she reached the room, Vikram and his cousin raped her and then threatened to kill her if she informed anyone about the incident. She approached the police on Saturday and a case was registered against the men.A police officer privy to the investigation, requesting anonymity, said, “We arrested the prime suspect in the case on Saturday. His cousin is still at large. We are investigating the matter.”A case was registered under sections 376D (a woman raped by one or more persons constituting a group or acting in furtherance of a common intention), 376 (2) (n) (commits rape repeatedly on the same woman) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) at Sector 51 police station on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/woman-raped-by-two-men-one-arrested/story-pSlO7AZksm2upnWpg9AAHM.html

This had also made it an accident-prone zone.In mid-February, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) had installed 734 LED streetlights on the 11.1-kilometre stretch of the road between Khusbhoo Chowk and the toll plaza at Bandhwari. However, work on connecting the streetlights with the main power lines remained.The remaining 14 kilometres of the 25-kilometre stretch falls in Faridabad, where the responsibility for installing and maintaining streetlights would fall under the Municipal Corporation of Faridabad (MCF).Raman Yadav, executive engineer, electrical division, MCG said that this work has now been completed.“We have spent around ₹1.69 crore on the project and it has taken around 18 months to complete. Although we had not set a deadline for the project, the model code of conduct for general elections and state elections, NGT order last winter to stop construction and the coronavirus epidemic had resulted in interruptions. Otherwise, work would have been completed late last year,” said Yadav.The streetlights were dismantled in July 2012, when the state highway was being widened from a two-lane road to a four-lane one.In a report in January, the Gurugram traffic police had identified Ghata crossing, on Gurgaon-Faridabad Road as one of the seven major points in the city where accidents were taking place frequently due to lack of illumination at night.“Lack of illumination is one of the major contributors to accidents. Sharp cuts and several blind spots have made driving on the Gurgaon-Faridabad Road even more dangerous. The reinstallation of streetlights would, thus, make a major difference in bringing down accidents at the stretch,” said Sarika Panda Bhatt, programme coordinator with Haryana Vision Zero (HVZ).Besides connecting the two cities, the Gurgaon-Faridabad Road also provides an alternative route to reach destinations in south Delhi, along the heavily congested Mehrauli-Gurgaon (MG) Road.As per a June 2016 study on traffic and transport by the Haryana Mass Rapid Transport Corporation (HMRTC), nearly 1.3 lakh people crossed the Gurgaon Faridabad Road at Baliawas on a daily basis. It is estimated that over 1.7 lakh people use the stretch on a daily basis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurgaon-faridabad-road-lit-up-after-8-years/story-AdwCCbIGCNFlYfe1HTcOiJ.html

11-05-2020||Noida||Noida: Constable suspended for assaulting two men out to fetch water in Sector 22||A police constable who works with the Lucknow commissionerate, and is currently posted in Noida, was suspended Saturday night for allegedly assaulting two men who were out to fetch water in Sector 22.The alleged incident took place on Saturday afternoon near some barricades placed in Sector 22. The alleged incident was captured on camera and has been doing the rounds on social media.The two men are reportedly from Chauda village, a containment zone in Sector 22.In the video, the two locals had purportedly crossed the police barricades and were out to fetch water from a nearby source. A man can be seen trying to stop them from going any further leading to an argument between the two parties with several people watching them.This man later called out a policeman standing nearby, who came to the spot and purportedly kicked one of the victims first, and then took his water container to hit the second person. While threatening the duo to go back home, the policeman allegedly used abusive language against the two persons. According to the police, it wasn’t clear initially whether the assailant was a policeman or a private security guard. However, a probe in the matter revealed it was a police constable who had assaulted the two men.“The constable was later identified as Manish Yadav. Yadav works with the Lucknow commissionerate, but is from Noida. When the lockdown was enforced and all public transport came to a halt, Yadav was in town and reported for duty here itself on April 16. On April 24 he was told to work with the Sector 24 police and was deployed in a hot spot area,” said Rajneesh Verma, assistant commissioner of police (zone 1), Noida, who also led the inquiry against Yadav.Verma said the men who were assaulted were identified from the video, and their statements were taken along with those of several witnesses. The police said the two men have not filed a police complaint in the matter.The police added the matter had escalated after the two people allegedly ignored the constable’s instructions after he had asked them not to step out to fetch water earlier in the day as well.Based on the inquiry by the Noida police, the constable was immediately removed from active duty and was suspended for “indiscipline” and for “misbehaving with the public”. The orders for his suspension came from the Lucknow commissionerate, based on the recommendation by the Noida police. Police officers said that Yadav has been handed over to Lucknow police and a departmental inquiry has also been ordered against him.“A probe is still underway, and if the role of any other person who could have instigated the violence in any way is established then action will be taken against him as well,” the ACP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-constable-suspended-for-assaulting-two-men-out-to-fetch-water-in-sector-22/story-BQwPDsNjidnJiZhhInIPQI.html

The migrants had assembled there to collect the ration sought through the district administration’s helpline 1905.Most of them said that they had run out of all supplies and their children had been sleeping on an empty stomach for several days. “We can endure the pain of the lathi but can’t beat to see our children crying for food. Aren’t we human? The authorities should understand our plight,” he said.Some others blamed the administration’s lack of planning which led to the large queues of people. “The department sends SMS to 1,000 people at each station 24 hours before the ration distribution starts. One has to go through various checks it takes nearly 10 minutes before all the formalities are completed. Imagine the plight of the man standing last in the queue,” said one of the persons in the queue.A police officer, who was on crowd control, while expressing his helplessness said that such scenes have become a routine. “People swam at the place where ration is being distributed. We feel bad that we have to use the stick but we have no other option,” said the cop deployed at Amarpura.SDM ASKS PEOPLE TO FOLLOW SOCIAL DISTANCING NORMSOn the other hand, sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) AS Bains urged people not to panic and follow social distancing norms. “If such situation continues, then we will call lesser number of people but it will result in pendency. So people should also cooperate with the government and follow social distancing norms,” said SDM Bains.Area councillor Gurdeep Singh Neetu flayed the ration distribution scheme. He said that the police was distributing ration among those people who had applied on 1905, and the area councillor has no role in it. “Instead of making people stand in a queue, authorities should deliver it at their doorsteps to avoid the chaos,” said Neetu.Meanwhile, some migrants alleged that since they were not the councillor’s vote bank, they were struggling to get essential supplies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hungry-anxious-migrants-jostle-for-dry-ration-packets-in-ludhiana/story-da0GL7R4XatIfXIV994s3N.html

11-05-2020||City||Railway police in Ludhiana agitated as migrants continue trespassing tracks||Keeping migrants away from railway tracks is one of the most difficult tasks for the railway police personnel in Ludhiana these days. Even though regular checks are conducted on the 20km-long stretch of railway line from Phillaur to Dhandari Kalan in Ludhiana, migrant labourers are found sitting on and crossing the tracks.On Sunday afternoon at around 3pm, over a dozen labourers were found sitting along the railway lines, taking refuge from the hot sun under the railway over bridge near the Dholewal Chowk.Meanwhile, a few workers were also found running temporary stalls along the tracks under the bridge. Some of these migrants were rickshaw pullers who did not have rooms and spent their nights either sleeping on the roadside or on their vehicles. Other migrants were daily wagers residing in labour quarters located alongside the tracks.One of the migrant labourers who resided in the labour quarters, Jugal Kumar, said, “We feel very congested inside the quarters, which is why we come out and sit either along the roadside or on the tracks in the shade to get a breath of fresh air.”Kumar said that he had applied to return to his village in Lucknow and was waiting for his turn to board the train. “The factories are closed and we have been out of work for the last one month,” he said, adding, “We cannot sit idle for so long within a small room.”A daily wager Yamuna said, “Sometimes, some people come to distribute langar here at the Dholewal Chowk. We visit the area in afternoon and also in the evening in a hope of getting some food.”However, after alerting the railway police official, sub-inspector Balvir Singh, station house officer (SHO), Government Railway Police (GRP), along with his team and two railway protection force personnel, reached the spot. On seeing the police, the migrants dispersed and fled from the tracks.SHO Singh said that the police teams were making rounds of the area. “As soon as the migrants see the police, they leave only to come back later after the personnel have left,” he said.He further said that the police are trying to curb the menace, however, it is not easy. “It is not possible to deploy so many police personnel on the 20km long track. At present, a number of GRP personnel are already deployed at the railway station to maintain law and order as a huge number of migrants are availing the facility of Shramik Special trains,” he added.Meanwhile, a few police personnel, on the condition of anonymity, said that nothing will change the situation. They said, “On regular days when hundreds of trains were running every day, the migrants still trespassed the tracks,” while questioning, “How we can expect these migrants to change their habits now when only a limited number of trains are running.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-railway-police-personnel-agitated-as-migrants-continue-trespassing-railway-tracks/story-67fx3OP0hBOFvmFiCQ8bdL.html

The close contacts of these cases are being taken to the swab centre. The positive cases will be sent for treatment immediately and the negative ones will be kept in observation for some time in either Ladkat school or a hall in Wadia College.”Rajender Kumar, 30, a native of a town in Basarahi village in Jaunpur district of Uttar Pradesh, said, “We have filled out forms when they were made available. The company where we work is located in Tulapur. We walked from there to here because buses were shut and then we found that the trains were shut down too. If we get to Lucknow, we will make our way home. Just send us home.”He is accompanied by three others who were living in Jyotiba Phule School and are now stationed at Kasturba Gandhi School in Koregaon Park along with close to 120 others. There are labourers from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, and Chhattisgarh in these shelters.While the city administration is dealing with the increasing number of Covid-19 cases, the health officials require more space to quarantine suspected patients. The city administration is turning to spaces used as shelters for homeless and migrant labourers. In the form of hope for the labourers, however, the special trains for migrant labourers have begun.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/shelters-for-homeless-turn-into-covid-19-quarantine-facilities-swab-centres/story-RkM2bpnMOf2YZXuzvmQB5M.html

The state government will provide them with all necessary help.”Sanjay Shirsath, manager of A1 spices, said, “ We are into manufacturing coriander and turmeric powder. We have got all the requisite permissions and we operate between 9am and 5pm.”“Currently, we are working only with 20 per cent of our strength and expect our staff strength to grow in the next few months. The Covid-19 crisis has hurt us badly and the revenues have fallen flat. We expect the government to provide us with the necessary support like financial packages and other amenities, so that we don’t end up being sick units in the future,” he said.Ambalal Chaudhary of Shree Samartha Ice Cream Factory in Katraj, said, “The Covid-19 crisis and lockdown has led to the downfall of revenue earnings as we were shut during the summer season which is the peak season for business. However, there is a demand from the market now and we are catering to it.”“More than fifty per cent of the staff have stopped coming to work citing the dangers of the contagion,” he said.Paras Bhagat, detergent and soap manufacturer, said, “We have been sustaining losses from the last forty days as the entire manufacturing has been shut. Now, restoring the supply chain is a tedious task, but we are confident that business will become stable in the long term future,” he said.

While the victim’s kin say he ended his life as he was unable to arrange ration for his family, police said some personal problems prompted him to take the extreme step. The incident occurred late on Saturday night when the victim’s wife and two children were sleeping outside their room. His wife said they had nothing at home to eat and had been borrowing groceries and money from their neighbours to meet their daily needs. The victim’s son said the 38-year-old had registered himself on the administration’s helpline number (1905) for ration but to no avail. The victim had also queued up for ration outside Focal Point police station on Saturday, but returned empty handed, his son added. Meanwhile, around 500 labourers gathered in the colony and staged a protest against the police, district administration and Punjab government, alleging no transparency in ration distribution. They claimed that ration is not reaching the needy.Additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP, city 4) Ajinder Singh said the allegations of not getting ration were baseless, but the police were investigating the case from all aspects. “Ration distribution process is totally transparent. Due to space constraint in the police station, we have chosen a ground to distribute ration among the needy,” he said.Earlier on May 3, around 250 migrant labourers living in Sherpur, Dhandhari, Focal Point and nearby areas had blocked National Highway near Dhandari, alleging that they were not getting ration. They had also pelted stones and damaged at least 10 vehicles. Former UP minister says migrants being ignoredReacting over the incident, former cabinet minister in Akhilesh Yadav government, Balwant Singh Ramoowalia, said labourers working in Ludhiana are not getting ration and he had received many complaints in this regard.He said only migrant labourers are facing problem, while the locals are being provided ration.“I don’t say the Punjab government and administration are not providing ration to labourers, but the distribution system is not correct. The government should take care of migrants for another 10 to 12 days, after which all labourers will be brought home,” said Ramoowalia.“Punjab should also speed up the process of sending migrants to their native places. I do not doubt the intention of the government, but it needs more determination. If the government is really committed to controlling the spread of Covid-19, it should make all necessary arrangements and facilitate their transportation,” he added.RK Yadav, general secretary, Punjab, Samajwadi Party, and TR Mishra, chairman of Purvanchal Party, said that they had also raised the issue of discrepancies in ration distribution multiple times, but nothing was done.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/migrant-worker-from-up-hangs-self-kin-say-failing-to-arrange-ration-forced-him-to-end-life/story-2Xel3RAtfy1OEyEyiVpD8M.html

11-05-2020||Pune||Students stranded in Pune get to go home via special buses||Students from Kolhapur stranded in Pune were sent home by two private buses on Sunday from the Swargate bus depot. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) state president Chandrakant Patil and Kothrud legislator arranged for the travel of these students who were stranded in the city due to lockdown.“We received registration forms from students who were stranded in Pune and belonged to Kolhapur district. So after completing all the necessary procedure to get the legal passes and permissions, all these students have now been sent back to their homes today,” Patil said. Rishikesh Joshi, a student who travelled in the bus to Kolhapur, said, “It had become very difficult for us to survive in Pune and my parents were worried about me. I had applied to go back to Kolhapur and today we are being sent by a bus back home, it is a great relief to us.”Similarly, for long distance travel of stranded migrant labourers in the city, two shramik trains departed from Pune railway division carrying registered workers back home. The Pune district administration coordinated with the workers and sent the list to the railways after which trains have been running from different railway stations in the district. “We have started running special trains for stranded people for which we get all the necessary data of passengers and permissions from the Pune district administration. All our railway staff from different departments with utmost precautions have carried out running of these special trains, keeping in mind all the social distancing norms during the operations,” said Manoj Jhavar, spokesperson, Pune railway division.In another instance, a special state transport bus of the Maharashtra State Transport Corporation (MSRTC) carrying 44 students who were preparing for competitive exams were sent to Jalgaon. A medical check-up was conducted for all students, they were also given a meal packet, a water bottle and a hand sanitiser before departing the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/students-stranded-in-pune-return-home-via-special-buses/story-sA3wm88b5x6lIUCR1RxbmM.html
11-05-2020||Pune||Dhabas, wedding halls in Pune district to provide food, shelter to migrant labourers||Left without jobs and desperate to return home amid the lockdown, migrant labourers have set off on foot from Pune for their native places. The Pune administration has asked the officials concerned to make necessary arrangements for such migrants at dhabas and wedding halls/mangalkaryalays available on highways in the district and set up camps for them.Pune district collector Naval Kishore Ram on Sunday issued an order for tehsildars and block development officers (BDOs) to immediately establish labour camps along main roads. The camps would be established at reasonable distances from each other on the three roads leading to Nashik, Bengaluru and Hyderabad. The number and location of the camps would be determined by the tehsildars based on the requirement.Ram said, “Ever since we lifted travel restrictions for migrants, most of them are trying to reach home either on foot or on bicycles. This long distance travel will hamper their health, and hence, I have ordered all tehsildars to set up camps at dhabas and wedding halls along the national highways so that the workers can rest in between their journey. The will be provided with food and shelter at these camps.”According to Ram, at each camp, there would be facility of water, toilets, safe place to stay, food and basic medical care, including facility of check-up for flu-like symptoms. Adequate police security would also be deployed at the camps for the safety of migrants, women and children and an official would also be appointed as the camp manager. Migrants can also register online through the state’s ‘Aaple Sarkar portal’ to access transport facilities being provided by the government.“The camp expenses would be met through the state disaster relief fund. Each taluka has been given Rs 10 lakh to Rs 20 lakh as advance to provide relief. I am hoping that other travellers will pitch to pay for these labourers at the dhabbas or even the dhabba owners can help in providing them food during their long walk,” said Ram.Exit plan for migrantsRam is leaving no stone unturned to get transportation arranged for the migrant labourers. “We recently sent 900 tribal students to Nandurbar from Ambegaon via state transport bus and are talking to the railways to arrange five more trains to Bihar,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/dhabas-wedding-halls-in-pune-district-to-provide-food-shelter-to-migrants-who-set-off-on-foot-for-their-hometowns/story-CTzOrgFke8fbnVPDmsNvRI.html
11-05-2020||World||Row over lockdown messaging as UK toll crosses 32,000||The Boris Johnson government on Monday came under fire from the opposition Labour, leaders of Scotland, Wales and members of the public for allegedly confusing messages on easing lockdown curbs, as the UK-wide death toll reached 32,065. Johnson dropped the hitherto core message to ‘stay home’ in a widely watched televised address on Sunday evening, but Scotland first minister Nicola Sturgeon pointed out that his announcement applied only to England and that Scotland would retain the ‘stay home’ advice.The number of coronavirus cases in the UK rose to 223,060, the Department of Health and Social Care said.Instead of the ‘stay home’ advice, Johnson said people should now ‘stay alert’ and those who cannot work from home should be “actively encouraged” to return to work. But the new advice was promptly criticised by Labour, trade unions and people for lack of clarity.A 60-page document setting out details of the new official advice was published on Monday afternoon, which included covering the face in public places. A five-stage alert system was also announced.Labour leader Keir Starmer said: “I was actually quite surprised the prime minister said, effectively in 12 hours’ time, start going back to work without those (guidelines on making workplaces safe) in place”.“We needed that clarity and it is unravelling a bit this morning because I think the foreign secretary (Dominic Raab) has now said, ‘Well, go back to work doesn’t really mean until Wednesday’, so suddenly it has shifted.”First ministers of Scotland and Wales said they would retain the ‘stay home’ message.Sturgeon said: “I think the prime minister has to make it clearer when he is talking only for England. What I don’t think is right for any government to do is to say we’re encouraging people to go back to work who haven’t worked so far before the guidance on what a safe working environment is has been published. That’s the bit that should come first.”Wales first minister Mark Drakeford added: “There are some differences in the messaging between England and Wales which I am concerned may cause confusion”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/row-over-lockdown-messaging-as-uk-toll-crosses-32-000/story-6LJ1k3gvFUJeIet07QjKfK.html
11-05-2020||World||13,500 British nationals repatriated from India on 58 flights||Around 13,500 British nationals stranded in India due to the coronavirus lockdown have been repatriated to their homes in the UK, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) said on Monday.More than 30,000 British travellers have now returned to the UK on 142 special UK government charter flights from 27 different countries and territories since the outbreak of the coronavirus. The 30,000th passenger returned home on a special charter flight from India’s Amritsar city on Saturday evening.“On top of the 1.3 million Britons we’ve helped return on commercial flights, we’ve now brought back 30,000 UK travellers from 27 countries,” said UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab.“We remain tirelessly focused on helping the most vulnerable Brits around the world get back home safe and sound,” he said.The FCO said it has been working around the clock with the airline industry and host governments across the world, with a 75-million pound fund for special charter flights to priority countries, focused on helping the most vulnerable travellers.So far, charter flights have returned British nationals to the UK from countries ranging from India, Pakistan and Nepal to Bolivia, Bermuda and New Zealand. India leads with 13,500 travellers returning so far since April 8, followed by 4,000 British nationals on 19 flights from Pakistan since April 20. Over 2,000 British nationals have returned from South Africa from April 9-17, more than 1,500 from New Zealand since April 25 and around 1,600 from Bangladesh since April 21.In one case, British High Commission staff in India masterminded a 60-hour, 1,700-mile-long trip involving five different drivers and crossing seven states, even receiving a police escort at one point, to make sure a British citizen could take one of the special return flights to the UK.The FCO said other efforts included a group of volunteers rescued from a remote part of Madagascar, climbers extracted from mountains in Nepal by British Gurkhas and backpackers reunited with their families after being flown home from South America.“The FCO helped passengers return home by providing consular assistance, working with local authorities, local military teams and cruise operators to allow ships to dock. The FCO will continue to send charter flights to bring back vulnerable British nationals who have no other way to return to the UK,” the Foreign Office said.A package of measures to support British nationals who are still waiting to return to the UK has also been put in place. The support package addresses financial issues, healthcare concerns and visa extensions, as well as loans for those who cannot afford flights to the UK where they have exhausted all other options.Some UK residents are also using the Air India flights from different Indian cities laid on by the Indian government to fly back stranded Indians from the UK as part of the Vande Bharat Mission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/13-500-british-nationals-repatriated-from-india-on-58-flights/story-sqMdUnNYgoranw54zYRIzL.html
11-05-2020||World||Covid-19 crisis: Paris awakens after 2-month slumber to world of yore, slowly||After a two-month freeze, Paris slowly awakened on Monday to the world it had lost under lockdown as hairdressers, florists, nail salons and some other businesses reopened - but under mandatory social distancing requirements.Like a just-awakened sleeping beauty, the City of Light needed to rub its eyes on the first day of relaxed home confinement rules. Shopkeepers trying to recover losses may need to wait days for Parisians to rediscover the daily habits from before the coronavirus halted most public life.“It’s a bit an act of faith today,” said Edouard Lefebvre, who heads the business district on the Champs-Elysees Avenue, packed with crowds of locals and foreign tourists in normal times.Only half of the avenue’s shops were open Monday, Lefebvreon said, reflecting the extensive preparations needed to safely receive customers and the hesitant steps many people took toward pre-pandemic routines.“Clients won’t come back on day one. It takes time to get used to coming back to the Champs-Elysees, to come back to Paris,” Lefebvre said in an interview with the Associated Press.Vehicles began filling streets again, but there were no traffic jams reported, and numerous people used bicycles to get around.Restaurants and bars - at the heart of France’s proverbial joie de vivre - are still waiting to learn when they will be back in business and cafe life can resume under the French government’s phased-in lifting of restrictions it imposed to stem the country’s coronavirus outbreak.France was hit hard by Covid-19, recording more than 26,000 virus-related deaths as of Sunday night. The virus still is circulating. Authorities, trying to strike a balance between public health and boosting the economy as cases plateaued, reopened numerous sectors around the country. They will reassess the situation in three weeks, wary of a second wave.Parisians grown used to hearing birds and smelling clean air during lockdown may find some aspects of deconfinement unpleasant, like motorists honking their horns and the heavy equipment at the capital’s thousands of construction sites, a source of inconvenient detours and noise that drowns out the sounds of nature.A construction worker on a Left Bank residential project that’s been in the works for two years said it was a pleasure to be back on the job after a period of home confinement that got a bit long. To guard against exposure to the virus, masks are obligatory for workers, hand sanitizer dispensers are in place around the huge site, and crews use one-way routes to move from floor to floor to maintain social distancing.Parisians donned heavy coats against a blustering wind and colder weather to stroll through their neighbourhoods without the permission slips they needed to venture out for just a few permitted purposes: food shopping, short jogs and imperative business.Now, the French can travel legally within a radius of 100 kilometers (60 miles) from their homes.For many shopkeepers, survival may depend on quickly enchanting everyone again, a special challenge with distancing rules that keep some waiting at the door to enter.“It will be a return, but slowly,” said florist Iswar Boodhoo whose shop is located on a strategic corner of the Montparnasse area, a Left Bank entertainment haunt.“People haven’t been working. They have lots of problems and flowers are a luxury,” he said.Lefebvre, of the Champs-Elysees business district, bemoaned what he said has been an 18-month-long economic “disaster” for Paris, from the weekly demonstrations by yellow vests movement protesters, to a major transportation strike over pension reform and then the coronavirus crisis.“Despite this, we are opening full of hope, even if it will take a long time to reconquer,” he said. “It’s important for a city like Paris to live again.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-crisis-paris-awakens-after-2-month-slumber-to-world-of-yore-slowly/story-wQ4ovHG0V78KcVUyJyTqrM.html
11-05-2020||World||Covid-19 update: Restart or re-stop? Countries reopen amid second-wave fears||Plastic spacing barriers and millions of masks appeared on the streets of Europe’s newly reopened cities Monday, as France and Belgium emerged from lockdowns, the Netherlands sent children back to school and Spain let people eat outdoors.All faced the delicate balance of trying to restart battered economies without causing a second wave of coronavirus infections.Fears of infection spikes in countries that eased their restrictions have been borne out over the past few days in Germany, where new clusters were linked to three slaughterhouses; in Wuhan, the Chinese city where the virus started; and in South Korea, where one nightclub customer was linked to a 85 new cases.Health officials in the U.S. will be watching closely in the coming days for any resurgence of the virus two weeks after states began gradually reopening.Authorities have warned that the scourge could come back with a vengeance without widespread testing and tracing of infected people’s contacts, and efforts to assemble contact-tracing teams are underway in Europe and the U.S.While some countries such as Germany have established robust tracing abilities, other countries are far behind. Britain abandoned an initial effort in mid-March when the virus’s rapid spread made it impossible. Now it is recruiting 18,000 people to do the legwork of tracking contacts.Britain and other countries are also developing contact-tracing cellphone apps that can show whether someone has crossed paths with an infected person.In the hardest-hit corner of the U.S., contact tracers in New York began online training Monday. A May 15 goal for reopening parts of the state hinges on the ability to track the spread of the virus.Gov. Andrew Cuomo set a requirement of 30 contact tracers per 100,000 residents for areas to reopen. That translates to about 6,000 workers statewide.Contract tracing across the rest of the U.S. is a patchwork of approaches and readiness levels.In loosening up the country’s lockdown, German authorities have spelled out a specific level of infection that could lead to the reimposition of restrictions in local areas. Other countries — and U.S. states — have been vague about what would be enough to trigger another clampdown.With Monday’s partial reopening, the French did not have to carry forms allowing them to leave their homes. Crowds formed at some metro stations in Paris, but the city’s notorious traffic jams were absent. Only half the stores on the Champs-Elysees were open.Parisian hairdressers planned to charge a fee for the disposable protective gear they will have to give customers. Walk-ins will be a thing of the past, said Brigitte L’Hoste, manager of the Hair de Beauté salon.“The face of beauty will change, meaning clients won’t come here to relax. Clients will come because they need to,” said Aurelie Bollini, a beautician at the salon. “They will come and aim at getting the maximum done in the shortest time possible.”In South Korea, the government clamped down again, halting school reopenings planned for this week and reimposing restrictions on nightclubs and bars. It is trying to track down 5,500 patrons of a Seoul nightlife district by checking credit-card transactions, cellphone records and security camera footage.In China, Shanghai Disneyland reopened but with limited visitors who had to wear face masks and have their temperatures checked.Roughly half of Spain’s 47 million people shifted into looser restrictions, beginning to socialize, shop in small stores and sit outdoors at restaurants. Its biggest cities, Madrid and Barcelona, remained under lockdown.Spanish hotels were allowed to open with precautions, but their financial prospects were bleak with people not allowed to travel outside their provinces and few flights from overseas.“Unfortunately this year’s business is lost already. It’s going to be catastrophic,” said Manuel Domínguez, manager at Seville’s Doña María Hotel.In Belgium, Brussels’ City2 shopping mall reopened, and “everyone was impatient to open their shops, see their customers, so it is a relief despite the tremendous work they did to adapt their shops, to create paths with entries and exits for customers,” said manager Jurgen De Gelas.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a modest easing of the country’s lockdown but urged citizens not to squander the progress made. Some people, however, were confused as the government shifted its slogan from “Stay at Home” to “Stay Alert.” Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland stuck with the old motto.At the risk of more confusion, the British government did an about-face on masks Monday, telling people to cover their mouth and nose in stores and on buses and subways.People in jobs that cannot be done at home “should be actively encouraged to go to work” this week, Johnson said. He also set a goal of June 1 to begin reopening schools and shops if Britain can control new infections. Johnson himself is the only world leader to suffer a serious bout of COVID-19.At London’s Waterloo train station, not everyone was convinced.“I am nervous about going back, because I have a family and they have been isolating since the start. I feel like I am now putting them at risk,” said Peter Osu, 45, who was returning to work at a construction site.In the U.S., Trump administration officials spoke optimistically about a relatively quick economic rebound from the pandemic — but then announced that Vice President Mike Pence is “self-isolating” after an aide tested positive.The U.S. has seen 1.3 million confirmed infections and about 80,000 deaths, the most in the world by far, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. Worldwide, 4 million people have been reported infected and more than 280,000 have died, over 150,000 of them in Europe. Health experts believe all those numbers understate the true toll of the outbreak.Dr. Christopher Murray, director of the University of Washington institute that has created a widely cited model projecting the course of the outbreak, said that moves by states to reopen businesses “will translate into more cases and deaths in 10 days from now.” Infections and deaths are going up more than expected in Illinois, Arizona, Florida and California, he said.India reported its biggest daily increase in cases Monday as it prepared to resume train service to ease a lockdown that has hit migrant workers and their hungry families especially hard.In South Africa, authorities in Cape Town and the surrounding province considered reimposing a stricter lockdown as the area became the country’s coronavirus hotspot. The province accounts for about half of South Africa’s 200 virus deaths.___Perry reported from Wellington, New Zealand.

The total number of coronavirus cases in Nepal now stands at 134, it said, adding that 33 patients have recovered so far. Eight of the 22 cases reported from Kapilvastu district were those who returned to Nepal from India (Mumbai) last month, according to local authorities.“As we have reported new cases, we will expedite contact tracing now,” Yogendra Bhagat, chief of the health office, told Republica Online. Kapilvastu district is on high alert after a number of Covid-19 patients were reported from there, according to Chief District Officer Dirgha Narayan Poudel.He also added that the newly-confirmed cases and all others who returned from India have been kept in quarantine centres. The total number of active coronavirus patients in the Himalayan nation has reached 88 as 33 patients have been successfully treated. So far, Nepal has conducted PCR tests on 17,809 people for detecting the novel coronavirus.Earlier, confirmed coronavirus cases have been reported in Nepal from persons returning from the Tablighi Jamaat gathering in New Delhi’s Nizamuddin area in March.On May 4, sixteen people, including 15 who were already on quarantine after they came in contact with a religious leader who returned after attending the Tablighi Jamaat gathering in Delhi in March, were tested coronavirus positive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-s-covid-19-cases-reach-134-after-8-more-returnees-from-india-test-positive/story-rdjjckTWVaLInCJzQQfmhN.html

The US last week announced it was limiting the visa-period for Chinese journalists to 90 days with the option to extend it.The Chinese foreign ministry said Washington to correct its mistakes against Chinese journalists immediately or it will face countermeasures.Opposing the US move, spokesperson Zhao Lijian on Monday said the US was escalating political suppression of Chinese media.It will affect their normal reporting in the US and affect bilateral people-to-people exchanges.“We are resolutely opposed and strongly dissatisfied with this,” Zhao said.“We require the U.S. to immediately correct its mistake, or China will have no choice but to take countermeasures.”Beijing and Washington have been involved in a series of tit-for-tat actions against journalists in recent months amid the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.In March, China expelled American journalists from three US newspapers, soon after the US said it would begin to treat five Chinese state-run media entities as foreign embassies.Weeks earlier, China expelled three Wall Street Journal reporters - two Americans and an Australian - after the paper published an opinion column calling China the “real sick man of Asia”.The two countries have been engaged in a series of critical diplomatic exchanges in recent weeks with Washington accusing Beijing of mishandling the pandemic, which first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.The coronavirus has infected more than 4.1 million people and killed over 282,000, according to the US’s Johns Hopkins University.China has retaliated by accusing the US of falsehood and having failed to tackle the outbreak in the country.On Sunday, China released an essay titled “Truth in China’s pandemic battle smashes absurd US allegations”, accusing American politicians of distorting facts to serve “political and propaganda purposes”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-warns-of-countermeasures-after-us-tightens-visa-rules-for-chinese-journalists/story-1CDbQkdu6MvnGUzoWaXLSP.html

But the White House, America’s safest workplace, has become a “scary” place to work after recent infections, a senior official has acknowledged.“Vice President Pence will continue to follow the advice of the White House Medical Unit and is not in quarantine,” Devin O’Malley said in a statement.But with two staffers testing positive for Covid-19 recently and three top members of President Donald Trump’s coronavirus task force going into self-quarantine after contacts with one on them, the White House may not look as safe as it ought to be, with all the resources available to it.“It is scary to go to work,” Kevin Hassett, a top economic adviser to the president who works in the White House, said on the CBS Sunday.On CNN, Hassett described his workplace, the West Wing that houses the president’s office and all his senior aides, as something that “with even all the testing in the world and the best medical team on Earth, is a relatively crammed place”.A US navy personnel, who was a personal valet to the president, was the first to test positive of Covid-19 last week. The day after, Katie Miller, press secretary to the vice-president, followed bringing the virus right into the inner sanctum of the White House. She is married to Stephen Miller, a senior adviser to the president on immigration., and regularly attended meetings of the coronavirus task force, which s headed by her boss, the vice-president.Though Miller was not identified as the source, three top members of the task force — Anthony Fauci, head of the national institute of allergies and infection diseases; Stephen Kahn, head of the Drug and Food Administration; Robert Redfield, head of the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention— ent into self-quarantine on Saturday for “low-risk” exposure.Questions are being asked in the aftermath if the country’s safest workplace — as described last week by the president’s chief of staff Mark Meadows — what does it say for businesses, manufacturers and offices that are reopening and have far fewer resources to draw upon.Large parts of America are gearing up to reopen or have reopened as the rise in infections and fatalities continued to slow down. Deaths went up by 731 over the last 24 hours, in what is possibly the lowest single-day toll in weeks, to 79,531; and infections went up by 19,710 to 1.32 million.New York state, the epicenter of the American epidemic, accounted for more than a third of both the infections and fatalities with 1.8 million 26,641 respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-updates-us-vice-president-mike-pence-is-fine-but-senior-white-house-staffer-says-scary-to-go-to-work/story-Bmw05iKnyoFZRvhPJy7ujO.html

11-05-2020||World||New rise in Covid infections raises fears of a second wave||New clusters of coronavirus infections are igniting concerns about a second wave even as calls grow in some countries to relax restrictions even further.In Germany, where thousands have protested in recent days against the remaining restrictions, health officials said the number of people each confirmed coronavirus patient infects rose above 1 again, reflecting a renewed increase in cases.The number must be below one for outbreaks to decline.Worldwide, health officials are anxiously watching to see just how much infection rates rise in a second wave as nations and states emerge from varying degrees of lockdown.China reported 14 new cases on Sunday, its first double-digit rise in 10 days.Eleven of 12 domestic infections were in the northeastern province of Jilin, which prompted authorities to raise the threat level in one of its counties, Shulan, to high risk, just days after downgrading all regions to low risk.Authorities said the Shulan outbreak originated with a 45-year-old woman who had no recent travel or exposure history but spread it to her husband, her three sisters and other family members. Train services in the county were being suspended.Officials on Sunday also reported the first case of coronavirus in over a month in Wuhan, the city where the outbreak first started in December last year.“Epidemic control and prevention is a serious and complicated matter, and local authorities should never be overly optimistic, war-weary or off-guard,” said Jilin Communist Party secretary Bayin Chaolu.South Korea reported 34 more cases as new infections linked to nightclub-goers. It was the first time that South Korea’s daily infections were above 30 in about a month.Germany has seen regional spikes in cases linked to slaughterhouses and nursing homes. German officials have expressed concerns about the growing number of large demonstrations against the lockdowns, including one in the southwestern city of Stuttgart that drew thousands of participants. Police in Berlin had to step in Saturday after hundreds of people failed to respect social distancing measures at anti-lockdown rallies in Berlin. Australia and Switzerland also witnessed similar rallies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-rise-in-covid-infections-raises-fears-of-a-second-wave/story-RgpcvHUiGtmU2FG9DhW8rK.html

As governments try to balance health and economic priorities, medical experts have said that new flare-ups are inevitable.One such incident was reported in California’s Pasadena where a cluster of new infections was discovered.Health officials said that a large group of extended family and friends had attended a recent birthday party, despite a stay-at-home order in effect, leading to the spurt in infection, The Washington Post reported.CNN reported that one guest - a woman - at the party was coughing and not wearing a face mask. She was joking with people that she may have Covid-19, the channel reported. There were other people, said CNN, who ignored social distancing norms and did not cover their faces.Some of the guests who CNN spoke to called the woman’s behavious selfish.Through contact tracing, investigators discovered more than five confirmed cases and “many more ill individuals” linked to the party, the local public health department was quoted as saying.More than 65,000 people are infected with the coronavirus disease in California and at least 2,687 have died, according to Johns Hopkins University data.The controversy over when, and how much, to ease the restrictions have taken on a sharp political overtone, with protests especially in the United States, with occasional violence against those trying to keep the rules in place.Meanwhile, health authorities are also investigating 73 reported cases among New York children of the syndrome, which has symptoms similar to Kawasaki disease or toxic shock syndrome, Governor Andrew Cuomo said during a news conference on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coughing-patient-at-a-birthday-party-results-in-covid-19-cluster-in-california/story-Ai7vty2RD9F9Lt5C1vLXuI.html

This was the highest daily increase in new cases since April 28.Mi Feng, spokesperson for the National Health Commission, warned people to “remain alert and step up personal protection against the virus.” This is the second double-digit increase in 10 days.Mi also asked people to “seek medical advice or testing in designated hospitals if they exhibit symptoms such as fever, cough or fatigue”. Of the 17 new cases, seven were listed as imported, while five were in the city of Wuhan, where a strict lockdown was lifted last month.The five new confirmed cases in Whuahn live in the same residential compound. One of them was the wife of an 89-year-old male patient reported a day earlier in the first confirmed case in the city since April 3.All of the latest confirmed cases were previously classified as asymptomatic - people who test positive for the virus and are capable of infecting others but do not show clinical signs such as a fever. Hundreds of asymptomatic cases in Wuhan, which was released on April 8 from a months-long lockdown, are currently being monitored, according to the city’s health authority. The number of new cases reported in China since April have been small compared with the thousands confirmed each day in February, thanks to a nationwide regime of screening, testing and quarantine.The National Health Commission, meanwhile, said that there had been no new Covid-19 death in China on Sunday. It has been a month since China reported any Covid-19-linked death.The country has reported 4,633 deaths from the virus among 82,918 total cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wuhan-reports-first-covid-19-cluster-authorities-ask-people-to-be-alert-amid-fears-of-resurgence/story-eVxXWjckPbIqlOYuQ5c09O.html

We’ve repeatedly stated our position on these. However, since the US kept repeating these lies, we must strive to help the world see the truth through facts time and again,” foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said at a press briefing. 24 LIES & FACTS about #COVID19https://t.co/STrpX9itri pic.twitter.com/BOGLSdISbOTalking about the allegations, she said, “They claimed China didn’t act fast enough. China is among the first countries hit by Covid-19. We have repeatedly shared the timeline of China’s response... they questioned the factuality of China’s numbers. People in their right mind will not assert blindly that other people are lying just because others’ numbers look better than their own. This is not children playing make-believe.”The spokesperson further sharpened the attack on the US, saying it did not act fast enough.“They questioned the factuality of China’s numbers. People in their right mind will not assert blindly that other people are lying just because others’ numbers look better than their own. This is not children playing make-believe,” said Hua.The Chinese foreign ministry has dedicated most of its press briefings over the past week to rejecting accusations by US politicians, especially Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, that China had withheld information about the new coronavirus and that it had originated in a laboratory in the city of Wuhan.“They talked about accountability and compensations. As was mentioned just now, survey results from Singapore show the Chinese people giving their government the highest rating for its response to Covid-19,” said China’s foreign ministry spokesperson.The article on the website of China’s foreign ministry also cited media reports that said Americans had been infected with the virus before the first case was confirmed in Wuhan. There is no evidence to suggest that is the case.Keen to quash US suggestions that the virus was deliberately created or somehow leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, the article said that all evidence shows the virus is not man-made and that the institute is not capable of synthesising a new coronavirus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-refutes-24-lies-by-us-over-covid-19-says-washington-did-not-act-fast-enough/story-6dyV8n800KN1YByq8VtjMP.html

He did not provide details of how the disease spread in the facility or if safety measures had been in place. He said that the 533 positive cases, which represents around 11.3% of Ghana’s total infections, were part of a backlog of about 921 cases going back as far as April 26 that are only recently being reported.The new cases pushed Ghana’s total since the pandemic was first reported in the West African nation in mid-March to 4,700 as of Sunday night, the highest number of infections in West Africa.The president said 22 people have died of coronavirus-related causes, while 494 have recovered. With 160,501 tests since the outbreak, Akufo-Addo said Ghana had carried out more tests per million people than any other country in Africa.“The implementation of our strategy of aggressively tracing, testing and treating is our surest way of rooting out the virus,” Akufo-Addo said.He announced an extension of a ban on public gatherings until the end of May, and schools and universities will remain closed.Akufo-Addo eased a three-week lockdown on Ghana’s two main cities, Accra and Kumasi, on April 19 amid concerns over a prolonged lockdown on the economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/one-person-infected-533-with-covid-19-at-ghana-fish-factory-president/story-nFgVdFJAHnaSbC1YjNOKdL.html

And Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergies and Infections Diseases told CNN he will be going in “modified quarantine”. All three are members of the White task force on the coronavirus outbreak.Fauci has said he will be working from home, will wear a mask and will go to office only when he will be sure to be the only one around at the time.Fauci, Hahn and Redfield are scheduled to testify before a committee of the US senate on Tuesday, but they will now not appear in person but through a video link.The source of their exposure was not identified. But Katie Miller, press secretary of Vice-President Mike Pence, tested positive for Covid-19 on Friday, used to frequently attend the meeting of the task-force, which is headed by her boss. She is the second White House staffer to test positive, after a US navy personnel serving as a personal valet to the president.The White House has stepped up screening since and both the president and the vice-president are now tested every day.At least 11 members of the US Secret Service, which protects present and past presidents, have also tested positive and 60 are in self-quarantine for possible exposure, according to news reports. It was not clear if any of them had been posted at the White House at the time of their exposure.US fatalities went up by 1,615 over the past 24 hours to 78,794 Sunday morning and the number of confirmed and reported infections increased by 25,621 over the same period to 1.3 million.President Donald Trump has personally faced criticism for not following his administration’s Covid-19 protocols to wear a mask in situations were social-distancing may be difficult. He met US military leaders at the White House on Saturday and did not wear a face covering, neither did any of the others.Questions have continued to be raised about President Trump’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak, which has ranged from being dismissive initially to finger-pointing when the situation spiraled out of control to self-congratulatory even while fatalities and infections mounted. President Barack Obama joined in in a recent conference call with about 3,000 erstwhile members of his administration. “It would have been bad even with the best of governments,” he said, in a recording first reported by Yahoo News. “It has been an absolute chaotic disaster when that mindset — of ‘what’s in it for me’ and ‘to heck with everybody else’ — when that mindset is operationalized in our government.”Trump had not responded to the attack yet, but he has frequently sought to blame his administration’s failures in the handling of the epidemic on Obama, saying he had left “empty shelves” of essential medical supplies such as masks, testing kits (despite the fact that this is a new virus), protective gear for healthcare workers and ventilators.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-us-public-health-officials-self-quarantine-obama-slams-trump-s-handling-of-epidemic/story-J0TLH1NkT2Yvbq5G9Gv88H.html

11-05-2020||India||1,700 women undertrials released since lockdown began: NCW||Since the lockdown was announced, over 1,700 women undertrials have been given parole by seven states to ensure social distancing in jails, the National Commission for Women (NCW) said on Monday.With 1,039 paroles, Uttar Pradesh let go of the maximum number of women undertrials, followed by Haryana with 223 women undertrials. Chhattisgarh (107), Gujarat (102), West Bengal (93), Delhi (73), Telangana (61) and Manipur (4) were the other states. The women’s agency had asked prison authorities from 25 states to take part in a review meeting on Monday to take stock of their reform measures for women inmates. The NCW had on April 22 asked states to implement a slew of measures for safety of women during the Covid-19 pandemic. On Sunday, a woman in Byculla jail was found to be positive for Covid-19. Most of the states reported 50-80% occupancy after authorities gave bail to women undertrials. “No cases of Covid-19 positive have been found in women’s prison wards and barracks,” the NCW said. NCW chairperson Rekha Sharma said the virtual meeting was necessitated by several states not following up on the April 22 advisory. Some jails, she said, had pregnant women. “Haryana, with 7 pregnant women, had the highest and Bihar has three. They are taken care of,” she said. Karnataka, she said, was giving jobs to women who have finished jail term or were on parole in a petrol pump run wholly by women. The prisoners in the state of Kerala have manufactured nearly 500 litres of sanitisers under the lockdown. “The state of Tamil Nadu has made total of 2900 video calls and other states were advised to advertise E-Mulaqat on a bigger scale. A commendable task is done by the state of Kerala, where 10,000 (female and male) prisoners were presented before the court for their (parole) proceedings,” the NCW said in a release. The women’s agency had in a letter on April 22 to Director General and Inspector General of Prisons in states, recommended that to decongest jails under the lockdown, women undertrials even in non-bailable offences be given bail application under Section 437(I)(ii) of the CrPC. Services of the respective state or District Legal Services Authority (SLSA/DLSA) should be provided to women so that they can place the applications of the inmates before a competent court, the letter said. The NCW had also suggested that the legal help should come with positive recommendation from the prosecution side. It also asked prison officials to maintain hygienic conditions and ensure supply of toiletries, masks, hand gloves and sanitisers, provide adequate medical and healthcare services. “Provisions for medical check-up and arranging for services of specialists like psychologists, psychiatrists, psychiatric social workers, gynaecologists on visit basis in the prison ... authorities should also arrange and encourage video conferencing of the prisoners with their family members, for the psychological and mental wellbeing and strength of the prisoners,” read the NCW’s recommendations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/1-700-women-undertrials-released-since-lockdown-began-ncw/story-81QsFc9hlBldXF2qqW27eI.html

It will, however, be some time before anything conclusive can be said on the results of this therapy,” said Dr Rajni Kant Srivastava, spokesperson for ICMR.In Delhi, seven institutes, including the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Indraprastha Apollo Hospital, Batra Hospital, Lady Hardinge Medical College, Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) Hospital and Max Hospital Saket have been approved to participate in the trials. Max Hospital in Saket had transfused plasma last month into a Covid-19 patient with good results. The patient was on ventilator, and the hospital sought approval on compassionate grounds as the family of the patient insisted.The patient recovered and was recently discharged, “but it is important that we also understand that plasma therapy is no magic bullet. During the patient’s treatment at Max Hospital, Saket, other standard treatment protocols were followed and we can say that plasma therapy could have worked as a catalyst in speeding up his recovery. We cannot attribute 100% recovery to plasma therapy only, as there are multiple factors which carved his path to recovery,” said Dr Sandeep Budhiraja, group medical director – Max Healthcare.The ICMR earlier this month came out with a detailed document on the study model using plasma therapy. The sample size finalised for the multi-centre clinical trials is 452.Currently, no effective treatments are available for the Covid-19 disease. Scientists and Researchers are working on many aspects of treatment options for the development of vaccination and medication to combat this life-threatening problem.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/icmr-nod-to-28-institutes-for-plasma-therapy-trials/story-GJjAehRZDI71maJWkq7skM.html

Mr. Vinay Mohan Kwatra at a meeting held at MoFA today and handed over a diplomatic note in this regard.”No further details were available. There was no immediate response to the development from Indian officials.The border row erupted months after Nepal was irked by the depiction of Kalapani, a region claimed by Kathmandu, as part of Uttarakhand in new Indian maps showing the Union territories of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh. Nepal sought talks to address the Kalapani issue, but New Delhi rejected Kathmandu’s protest, saying the new maps accurately depicted Indian territory.Earlier on Monday, Gyawali said Nepal could not wait for the end of the Covid-19 crisis for holding boundary talks with India. Gyawali, who was summoned by the Nepal parliament’s international relations committee, also said Nepal will hold talks with China after sorting out the issue with India, The Kathmandu Post reported.The Nepal parliamentary panel had summoned Gyawali to discuss the opening of the road to Lipulekh by the Indian government last week.“Nepal, India and China are yet to ascertain the tri-junction in Lipulekh. So after talks with India, we will hold talks with China as well,” Gyawal told the committee.“We are ready for talks at any level with India – at the Prime Minister’s level or the foreign secretary level,” he added.On Saturday, Nepal expressed regret at the inauguration of the route from Dharchula in Uttarakhand to Lipulekh, with the foreign ministry contending the road “passes through Nepali territory”.Defence minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated the 80km road on Friday to curtail the time taken for the pilgrimage to Kailash Mansarovar. The road ends at Lipulekh Pass, and will help pilgrims avoid dangerous high-altitude routes through Sikkim and Nepal.“The recently inaugurated road section in Pithoragarh district in the state of Uttarakhand lies completely within the territory of India. The road follows the pre-existing route used by the pilgrims of the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said on May 9.India and Nepal have an established mechanism for boundary issues, and the delineation of the border with Nepal is ongoing, Srivastava said. India is also committed to resolving outstanding boundary issues through diplomatic dialogue, he added.Nepal’s foreign ministry had sought talks between the foreign secretaries and Srivastava had said the two side are in the process of scheduling these talks, which would be held after they have dealt with the Covid-19 crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nepal-summons-indian-envoy-over-construction-of-new-lipulekh-road/story-hQp6xSgSPjSDcWznkMcXSJ.html

Applications seeking transfer of cases from one high court to another or from a trial court in one state to one in another state will also be heard by single-judge benches.The decision has been taken to reduce the backlog of cases as a large number of transfer petitions and bail matters clog up the docket at the top court.“It is a welcome move. Besides helping combat pendency, the kind of cases which will be heard by a single judge, that is bail matters and transfer petitions, require limited judicial application of mind. They are mostly matters involving questions of fact and, to a large extent, require application of discretion by the judges. Therefore, it is always better that a single judge hears such matters”, Supreme Court advocate Sriram Parakkat said.The Supreme Court had amended its rules in September 2019 to allow single-judge benches to hear matters.Before the amendment, Order VI, Rule 1 of the Supreme Court Rules of 2013 stated that every case in the top court has to be heard by benches that have at least two judges.To pave way for single-judge benches, a new clause was inserted in Order VI, Rule 1 carving out an exception. After the amendment last year, this would be the first time the change is being implemented.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/single-judge-benches-to-hear-cases-in-sc/story-zV7k9EJgBIFDNQzz1B0TgO.html
11-05-2020||India||SC tells panel to decide on J&K 4G restoration||The Supreme Court on Monday tasked a high-level committee of civil servants with deciding on the restoration of 4G mobile internet in the Union territory of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K), responding to a petition that argued the absence of high-speed connectivity had hindered access to the latest information and advisories about the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.The committee, which will comprise the secretary of the ministry of home affairs, secretary of the ministry of communications and the chief secretary of J&K, was directed to examine the arguments made by the petitioner, Foundation for Media Professionals, which had cited the detrimental effect of restrictions on mobile internet during the pandemic.“The Special Committee is directed to examine the contentions of, and the material placed by the petitioners as well as the respondents. The aforesaid Committee must also examine the appropriateness of the alternatives suggested by the petitioners, regarding limiting the restrictions to those areas where it is necessary and the allowing of faster internet (3G or 4G) on a trial basis over certain geographical areas,” the bench headed by justice NV Ramana said.The petitioner had approached the top court challenging an order issued by the J&K administration on March 26 restricting the internet data to 2G and called for 4G services to be restored.It claimed that patients, doctors, and the general public of J&K were unable to access the latest information, guidelines, advisories and restrictions related to Covid- 19 because of the restrictions.“Severe restrictions on the speed of mobile internet services directly limits the right of the public to know the latest information about the spread of Covid-19, the measures being taken to address it, and the restrictions imposed on the general public,” the petition said.The apex court bench, which also comprised justices R Subhash Reddy and BR Gavai, observed that while the court was aware of the difficulties faced by the citizens because of the restrictions, the court will have to balance the rights of citizens with considerations of national security cited by the government.“We have already laid down that the fundamental rights of citizens need to be balanced with national security concerns, when the situation so demands.” The court thus acknowledged that the restrictive orders do not provide any reasons warranting such restrictions in all the districts while making it clear that the militancy in J&K cannot be disregarded.“These competing considerations needs to calibrated in terms of our judgment in the Anuradha Bhasin case,” the court said.It was a reference to a judgment passed on January 10 in the Anuradha Bhasin case which held that access to information and the freedom of trade and commerce via the internet were fundamental rights under the Constitution of India. It had, therefore, ordered the central government and J&K administration to periodically review the orders passed to restrict internet services.Towards this end, the court had ordered that orders restricting the internet should be placed before a review committee that provides for adequate procedural and substantive safeguards to ensure that the restrictions are not sweeping in nature.Pursuant to the judgment, the J&K administration had passed various orders gradually lifting the restrictions on internet access in J&K. Orders were passed by the J&K authorities on March 4, 17 and 26 restricting internet speed for mobile data services to 2G.It was the petitioner’s case that 2G services only permit the sending and receiving of messages (SMSs and MMSs) on the mobile phone and the web browsing speed using 2G was limited. The restriction of mobile internet speed is unreasonable and unconstitutional during the time of a pandemic and consequent lockdown, the petitioner argued.“Various public health practitioners, medical professionals, and doctors have repeatedly expressed their concern about wasting precious time trying to download the latest studies, protocols, manuals and advisories on treatment and management of Covid-19. In some cases, doctors are not able to access these resources at all due to the internet speed being too slow to download heavy files,” the petition said.The Union territory, in its response, had stated that the right to access internet was not a fundamental right and mobile internet speed had been restricted to 2G in the interests of national security. Protection of the sovereignty and integrity of India and ensuring security of the country are good grounds to reduce the speed of the internet, it said, adding that the restrictions had been placed to ensure that the rights and interests of the citizens were not adversely affected, an affidavit by the J&K administration said.The affidavit was also pointed out that mobile phone services had been restored and restrictions on internet access also progressively lifted. Initial access was restricted to whitelisted sites (approved websites) which had been widened progressively to lifting of all restrictions on social media.“Fixed-line Internet connectivity with Mac-binding (can we explain), is available without any speed related restrictions,” the affidavit said.Mac-binding may be explained as binding together hardware identification number and IP address so that change in any of the address will block access to the Internet.Advicate Vrinda Grover said: “In today’s judgment, the Supreme Court has foregrounded the issue of balancing human rights against the interest of national security. This, to my mind, is a departure from the judicial approach in the Anuradha Bhasin judgment, where the Court had foregrounded rights as fundamental and located the power of the State to restrict rights in very limited and restricted situations, and subject to the tests of reasonableness, necessity and proportionality. A Special Committee comprising exclusively of persons from the Executive may tilt the balance further away from rights. Interestingly figures presented by the State show that terrorism and militancy continue even without 4G internet services. The question that confronts us then is for what kind of balancing are inalienable rights like right to healthcare, education and the right to access legal remedies being put in peril. This shift towards rights being subservient to national security and executive determination is worrisome.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-tells-panel-to-decide-on-j-k-4g-restoration/story-NYAnU8PXbV9I9QlvqTNZnM.html

With this, the state has also crossed the 23,000-mark within eleven days after it crossed 10,000 cases on April 30. The state’s case count has now jumped to 23,401.The death toll of the state also touched 868 as 36 deaths were recorded on Monday. Of them, 20 are in Mumbai, Solapur 5, Pune 3, Thane 2 and one each in Ratnagiri, Amravati, Nanded, Aurangabad and Wardha. In addition, one patient from Uttar Pradesh also died in Mumbai on Monday.Of the total number of deaths, 27 patients had co-morbidity conditions, health officials said.ALSO READ | ‘Mumbai’s local trains should resume only for essential services’: Uddhav ThackerayIn Mumbai, the worst-hit city in the country, the Covid-19 case count crossed the 14,000 mark as 782 cases were registered in a day, the second highest so far. Mumbai’s case count is now at 14,521. On Sunday, 875 cases were recorded. The death toll in Mumbai also reached 528. The rise in the number of cases is higher this month as compared to the fresh cases that were reported last month. The new cases that were in three digits till April end have turned into four digits since the last five days. On May 6, the daily cases rose to 1233, May 7 - 1216 cases, May 8 - 1089, May 9 - 1165 and on May 10 -- 1278 cases were reported. Besides, on May 10, the state also declared 665 cases respectively saying that they were registered in the last few days and are being declared as per the central government’s directive to bring the data at par with the national figures on the ICMR website. Between April 19 and 30, the state was reporting around 500 new cases on a daily basis but from May 1, the figures started showing a significant rise.In the last eleven days since May 1, the state has reported as many as 12,903 cases, whereas the total number of cases registered in April was 10,201.The officials indicated a further rise in cases and said that the curve will be flattened only after May 17 when the state would be completing the fourth incubation period. They are expecting a decline in cases from this month end.Dr Tatyarao Lahane, Director, Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER) said, “The containment areas have thick population and is likely to affect a large number of people for various reasons. So the number of new cases is likely to increase for a few more days till May 17. After this, the curve will flatten as by then we will be completing the fourth incubation period and the number of fresh cases will start coming down by this month end.”“By next month, we are expecting that things will be completely under control,” he added.The first Covid-19 positive case was found on March 9 and it took 30 days for the state to cross the 1000 mark.So far, 15,192 people have been kept in institutional quarantine in the state and over 2,48,301 people have been put under home quarantine. On Monday, the state also completed 49 days of lockdown that was imposed on midnight of March 23, a day before the nationwide lockdown was imposed by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It was partially lifted on April 20 in the areas where there are no cases or minimal in number.On Monday, the health department also declared that it had conducted 2,18,914 tests at various public and private facilities across Maharashtra. Of them 1,93,457 people tested negative. This is 19,852 less than what was declared on Sunday when the state declared it had tested 2,38,766 samples. It has clarified that they have declared figures following ICMR’s website.“Today, the state government has quoted sample testing figures posted on the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) website and that’s the reason there is disparity in figures compared to Sunday’s figures. It may have happened that many laboratories have not updated their figures on the ICMR website. We will ask them to do that and so the differences in the number of sample testing will be removed,” Dr Archana Patil, Director, directorate of state health services said.Maharashtra currently has 1256 active containment zones. Around 12,027 survey teams comprising doctors and assisting staff have screened more than 53.71 lakh people for the coronavirus infection. With the rising number of cases, the number of patients who have recovered so far also jumped to 3301 as 207 positive patients recovered on Thursday.The doubling rate in the state now stands at 10 days. The state government has decided to take the rate to 20 days in the days to come, health minister Rajesh Tope said. The state government has also resolved to bring the entire state into the green zone by this month end.The state government has recently changed the top brass of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) as the situation in Mumbai has gone from bad to worse. It has transferred civic body chief Praveen Pardeshi and appointed IS Chahal as the new BMC commissioner. The government has also appointed Sanjeev Jaiswal and Ashwini Bhide as additional municipal commissioners replacing AB Jarhad and Jayshree Bhoj.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-registers-36-deaths-1230-new-covid-19-cases-state-tally-is-at-23-401/story-Ql7u0CqDRJuEQiS8n9UqhI.html

State minister V S Sunil Kumar said symptomatic passengers will be shifted to hospitals from the stations and others would be transported to their home districts in specially arranged Kerala State Road Transport (KSRTC) buses.“These special trains will have only three stops in Kerala--Kozhikode, Ernakulam and Thiruvananthapuram.The Railways will provide us with the full address details of the passengers. We will segregate them according to their respective districts and finalise the list of people alighting at the three stations.Those who reach the state will be screened and tested for symptoms,” Sunil Kumar told PTI. As per central government guidelines, Railways has to ensure that all passengers are compulsorily screened and only asymtomatic passengers are allowed to board the trains. Passengers will be provided with hand santisers at entry and exit points at stations and in coaches and all passengers will have to wear face masks.On arrival at their destinations here, they will have to adhere to the state’s health protocols , he said.The minister said counters like those at the airports to screen passengers would be in place at the three stations.“We will open separate counters like we have done in the airports. We expect at least 1,400 people in each train and they will alight at three different stations. The final plan will be made by Wednesday evening,” he said.The passengers will be subjected to thermal screening at the railway stations. A passenger having high temperature would be segregated and sent to the hospitals for a formal check-up, he said.“Those who are symptomatic will be sent to hospital.Non-symptomatic persons will be allowed to board KSRTC buses, taken to their districts and home quarantined,” he added.Various departments and the local self government institutions will enquire whether the passenger has facilities at their residences to go into home quarantine and if not, they would be shifted to institutional quarantine.“We will also enquire whether the person has a facility to stay under home quarantine.For home quarantine, we will enquire whether the house has a bath-attached room, whether it is possible for the person to stay alone in the room and if there is anyone above the age of 60 years in that house. If not, we will arrange institutional quarantine. Paid quarantine is also available,” Kumar said.There was no need for any relatives or friends to reach the station to pick the passengers as the state has arranged transportation facility by KSRTC buses,he said.Kumar said Kerala has been following the Centre’s guidelines, which state that anyone arriving in Kerala from other states will have to be in strict 14 day quarantine. There will be local level monitoring committees to ensure that those who are under home quarantine do not move around to visit friends and relatives, he said. The state has 519 confirmed cases of COVID-19 till now and currently 27 are under treatment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-plans-to-have-airport-model-covid-19-screening-at-3-railway-stations/story-Wq0Sg4MMIX1wJs6fqkVt3M.html
11-05-2020||India||Committed to peace: China on LAC face-off||Beijing: China on Monday sought to downplay the confrontation between Indian and Chinese soldiers in Sikkim’s Naku La over the weekend, saying the two countries should jointly uphold peace and handle differences.The Indian army on Sunday confirmed an HT report on the clash and said a “heated confrontation took place between Indian and Chinese soldiers in north Sikkim on Saturday, resulting in injuries to troops on both sides”. The troops disengaged after talks at the local army level.The Chinese foreign ministry did not share details about the clash but attempted to subtly shift the blame to the Indian side, saying Chinese soldiers were always upholding peace and tranquillity along the border. “China and India stay in close communication and coordination concerning our border affairs within existing channels,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said at a regular briefing on Monday.He referred to the 70th anniversary of India-China diplomatic ties this year and added the two countries were joining hands in the fight against Covid-19. “Under such circumstances, the two sides should work together with each other, properly manage and handle the differences, earnestly uphold peace and stability in border region so as to create enabling conditions for our bilateral relations as well as the joint fight against Covid-19.”Zhao denied suggestions that Beijing was adopting an aggressive approach in its diplomacy as it is fighting the Covid-19 pandemic, which originated from China. “The relevant assumption is groundless,” he said in response to a question on it. “Since the outbreak of the Covid-19, China and India have been staying in close communication and cooperation on prevention and control, to jointly meet the challenges.”He called solidarity and cooperation against Covid-19 the most pressing concern for the international community. “We shouldn’t allow any politicisation or stigmatisation in a bid to create more differences or confrontation.”India and China have held a dozen rounds of talks to resolve the dispute over the 3,488 km border between the two countries stretching from Jammu & Kashmir to Arunachal Pradesh. The longstanding border dispute led to the 1962 India-China war. In 2017, China accused India of trespass and preventing its troops from building a road in the Himalayan Doklam plateau, which is under the Chinese control but claimed by Bhutan. The standoff began in June 2017 and ended after 73 days with the withdrawal of troops from both sides.Qian Feng, a senior fellow at the Taihe Institute, a think tank, said the China-India border issue was a leftover from the past and both sides had a different perception about it. “Despite this, the two countries’ leaderships and related authorities have established communication mechanisms. Their effectiveness was demonstrated by this incident as the problem was solved at the local level and did not escalate to a national level,” Qian told Chinese state media.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/committed-to-peace-china-on-lac-face-off/story-DrI7tHwwftUystmTVLNMRN.html
11-05-2020||India||On exiting Covid-19 lockdown 3.0, PM Modi asks chief ministers to come up with blueprint||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday asked chief ministers to spell out how they want to deal with the lockdown regime after May 17 when the third spell of the lockdown expires. PM Modi, who has described stopping the coronavirus disease from spreading to rural areas as the big challenge, said social distancing was the biggest weapon to fight the virus “till we do not find a vaccine or a solution”.“We must all plan for the new reality,” PM Modi told a marathon meeting of chief ministers that started at 3 pm and continued well past 9 pm. PM Modi and his top cabinet ministers including Home Minister Amit Shah sat through the conference, listening to each chief minister via video conference“We have a twofold challenge – to reduce the transmission rate of the disease, and to increase public activity gradually, while adhering to all the guidelines, and we will have to work towards achieving both these objectives”, he said.The national lockdown that the prime minister had first announced on March 24 is due to end on May 17.The last version of the lockdown that came into effect from 4 May had introduced considerable relaxations in districts that had not reported Covid-19 cases and eased restrictions elsewhere. The Centre’s objective all along was to gradually resume economic activity.“Slowly but surely, economic activities have begun to pick up in several parts of the country. In the coming days, this process will further gather steam,” PM Modi told the chief ministers.But as governments look at a gradual withdrawal of the lockdown, PM Modi said everyone must understand that the world had changed fundamentally over the last few months.“Now the World will be pre-corona, post-corona just like the case of the World Wars. And this would entail significant changes in how we function,” PM Modi said.The prime minister said the new way of life would be on the principle of “Jan Se lekar Jag Tak”, from an individual to the whole of humanity, a statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office later said.“I request you all to share with me by 15th May, a broad strategy on how each one of you would want to deal with the lockdown regime in your particular state. I want states to make a blueprint on how to deal with various nuances during and after the gradual easing of the lockdown,” PM Modi said.Before they get down to the task, PM Modi underscored that India would “need an all-encompassing approach” to deal with various challenges. Like the many non-Covid-19 diseases that could proliferate with the onset of monsoon. “We must prepare and strengthen our medical and health systems,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-exiting-covid-19-lockdown-3-0-pm-modi-asks-chief-ministers-to-come-up-with-blueprint/story-ivf8UZkSRbhmjRuswuRr5I.html
11-05-2020||India||Covid-19: Home quarantine for Odisha’s urban asymptomatic, mild symptoms patients||The Odisha government on Monday said that those living in urban areas who test positive for coronavirus disease Covid-19 but are asymptomatic or with mild symptoms can stay in home quarantine instead of institutional quarantine as per central guidelines. The government’s decision has come in the wake of a surge in the number of cases in the state which have doubled in just one week.Additional chief secretary of health department PK Mohapatra said a person in urban area who tests positive but has no symptoms or mild symptoms can stay in home quarantine for 14 days if all facilities as prescribed are available at home. Before being allowed to stay in home quarantine, the person will be stamped on the hand and a band will be tied on his wrist. A quarantine sticker will also be pasted at his house. Children less than 5 years old, pregnant women and divyangs or differently abled will be tested on priority, he added.Odisha has seen a steep rise in coronavirus infections in the last 16 days as the number of positive cases jumped to 414 on Monday as per the state government’s data, up from 103 on April 25, mostly due to the influx of migrants from Surat and Bengal, two Covid hotspots. Of the total positive cases in the state, more than 300 are Surat and Bengal returnees.Officials said the decision to put the Covid positive patients in urban areas in home quarantine was also driven by the reality that the number of hospital beds in the state may not be adequate in the coming days. Odisha has about 5,500 beds and 293 ICU beds in different Covid hospitals. However, health department officials estimate the requirement to be more than that as the number of positive cases are expected to rise in the coming weeks with more than 5 lakh migrant workers likely to return to the state. “Once more symptomatic cases come in, we have to keep beds free for them. We will also need to keep more ICU beds considering a possible spike in people having respiratory issues,” said a health department official.As the number of positive cases from quarantine centres populated by migrants from Gujarat, Bengal, Karnataka and other states went up, the Naveen Patnaik government has now directed the sarpanches or village heads to remain vigilant and keep an eye on the inmates of the centres. State government’s Covid-19 spokesperson Subroto Bagchi on Monday said an analysis of positive cases reported in the last few days has established that of the 241 positive cases, 229 were detected in returnees staying in quarantine centres in panchayats.Bagchi said the sarpanches have been asked to inform the government if they find Covid symptoms in any person staying in their quarantine centres so that immediate treatment can be extended to him or her. He added that following the initiative of Ganjam district collector, the government has directed the officials to impart training on Covid-19, its symptoms and remedial measures to those staying in quarantine centres. To keep the inmates of quarantine centres engaged, the Ganjam district administration has drawn up a daily schedule of activities that includes physical exercise, Covid community health work as well as cleaning and plantation work during the 28-day stay.Meanwhile, four doctors and two attendants of All India Institute of Medical Sciences in Bhubaneswar were sent in mandatory quarantine for 21 days on Monday after a road accident victim from Maharashtra they had treated tested positive for Covid-19. Ten homeguards of a police outpost in Janla under the jurisdiction have also been sent on quarantine for coming in contact with the injured truck driver.Officials said the 42-year-old truck driver from Mumbai was seriously injured in a road accident last week near Bhubaneswar. He died soon after being admitted to AIIMS. His blood and swab samples tested positive after his death.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-home-quarantine-for-odisha-s-urban-asymptomatic-mild-symptoms-patients/story-aIaCgfWxdoAWf79XSTDllI.html

The suggestion came at the meeting on Monday that the prime minister held via video conferencing with chief ministers of states and union territories to discuss the Covid-19 situation in the country. This was the fifth such meeting that PM Modi has held with the CMs on this matter. . Baghel further urged the PM that the state governments should have the right to decide on the conduct of economic activities within the state.“Chhattisgarh CM suggested to the PM that the state governments should be entitled to categorize the areas as red, green and orange zones in view of the status of spread of the infection, which has been done by Centre on the base of Covid-19 risk profiling,” said the press release issued by the state government after the video conference.The release added that the chief minister also requested the PM to provide financial assistance to the state.“Baghel requested the PM for financial assistance of Rs 30,000 crore to the state. He also urged that the credit limit for his state this year should be relaxed to 6 per cent and its fiscal deficit should be kept at 5 percent of the GSDP,” the release said.“The Chief Minister said that large amount money has been donated to the Prime Minister’s Care Fund by the industrial institutions of the state of Chhattisgarh. In order to provide relief to the needy people of Chhattisgarh in the hour of this crisis, the funds should be transferred to the state,” the release stated.Like the health workers, the Chief Minister requested the PM to include employees and officials of police department, municipal corporations, district administration and other departments under the PM Garib Kalyan Package. “He also urged to increase 100 days of employment fixed under MGNREGA to 200 days,” the release stated.“The Chief Minister also said that the state government had sought permission for a total of 28 trains to bring back labourers of Chhattisgarh, out of which only 15 trains have been approved. The state government is bearing the entire cost of bringing back the migrant workers, students, sick persons from other states. He said that about 1.2 lakh labourers of Chhattisgarh state are in other states,” the press release stated.CM Baghel also said that regular train and air services and inter-state bus transport should be started in consultation with the state governments.The nationwide lockdown to curb the spread of Covid-19 will continue till May 17.EOM||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/allow-states-to-categorize-areas-under-red-green-orange-zones-chhattisgarh-cm-to-pm-modi/story-O22zspe6p56XJepJ19xDNP.html

The same day, five other trains bound for Delhi will leave from Patna, Bengaluru, Howrah, Mumbai and Ahmedabad, the railways said. The fares will be equivalent to Rajdhani fares, it said.However, several Shramik Special trains have run from the station over the last week to transport thousands of stranded migrant workers to their native places. Northern Railways in a statement has said that entry to the New Delhi station will be from the Paharganj side for all confirmed ticket holders. No entry for passengers holding such tickets will be permitted from the Ajmeri Gate side, it said. For now, the railways has issued a timetable for trains to be run between May 12 and May 20. These trains will have only AC classes i.e. first, second and third AC. The fare structure shall be as applicable for the regular time-tabled Rajdhani trains(excluding catering charges). On May 13, eight trains will depart from the national capital headed for Howrah, Rajendra Nagar, Jammu Tawi, Thiruvananthapuram, Chennai, Ranchi, Mumbai Central and Ahmedabad.

This was the seventh week since the first case of Covid-19 was reported in the state from Dehradun on March 15.In the eighth week, from May 3-May 9, only 1,881 samples were tested with a reduction of 493 samples or 21%. This reduction in testing comes when locals stranded in other states have started returning to Uttarakhand amid lockdown 3.0.Clock here for full Covid-19 coverage.Dr. SK Gupta, director (in-charge) of medical and health department Uttarakhand said that testing is being done following all guidelines of the central government.“We are conducting tests based on the guidelines given to us. The guidelines state that contact persons of positive patients, those who are highly exposed to positive patients and symptomatic patients, or those with severe acute respiratory diseases are being tested,” said Dr. Gupta.When questioned whether the state government is planning to increase testing given the influx of migrants from different states, Dr. Gupta said, “Wherever we feel a person is suspected or has minor symptoms, s/he is being tested in the state. We have not received any updates from the state government yet on random sampling at a large scale.”Uttarakhand has so far tested 9,915 samples with maximum tests being conducted in Dehradun, Haridwar, Nainital and Udham Singh Nagar districts. Of this figure, 9,229 samples have been tested at government test centres and 686 samples tested at private labs.Only 691 samples have been tested so far in the state from remote and hilly districts of Uttarakhand. These districts include Almora with 116 tests, Bageshwar with 25 tests, Chamoli with 33 tests, Champawat 61 tests, Pauri Garhwal 106 tests, Pithoragarh 28 tests, Rudraprayag and Tehri Garhwal have tested 41 samples each and Uttarkashi district has tested 240 samples till now since March 15.Experts have raised an alarm and pointed out that with more people returning to the state, sampling should be increased to curb the spread of the deadly virus.Anoop Nautiyal, founder of Social Development for Communities, a Dehradun-based think tank, who has been analysing Covid-19 data in the state, said that apart from government’s efforts, responsible community participation is equally important.“People need to strictly participate and follow instructions along with the government’s efforts to control the spread of the disease. The role of a responsible citizen is very important here. Along with this, increasing the sampling size by the state government is also needed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-testing-rate-falls-in-uttarakhand-even-as-migrants-head-home/story-0eGwZDOzJ6V9qfR6FWbOkM.html

He, however, cautioned the villagers not to use air-conditioners and cook food at home till the experts give clearance.“The government itself would supply food to the villages for some more time. We shall have a night stay in the villages and assess the situation,” the minister said.An expert committee, from CSIR-National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI), which visited the LG Polymers plant and extensively toured the affected villages, is learnt to have observed that food and water stored by the people in the villages was not fit for consumption because of presence of Styrene residue in them.The experts’ team, which had a meeting with the high-powered committee of officials constituted by the state government, recommended that vegetables and fruits grown in the surrounding villages should not be consumed and even fodder should not be fed to the cattle.“The NEERI team suggested that even the local milk products in the area should not be consumed. The open water sources like wells and borewells should not be used for cooking till a final evaluation is done,” an official in the GVMC said on condition of anonymity.Meanwhile, the government distributed cheques for Rs 1 crore to eight out of the 12 families of the deceased in the Vizag gas leak incident on Monday afternoon. The compensation for others would be paid once their legal heirs are identified, minister Kanna Babu said.He said 13,000 tonnes of Styrene gas stored in a few tanks in Vizag port was being sent back to South Korea.“The GVMC staff has been creating awareness among the locals about the safety measures after the gas leak and how to dust away the residue,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jagan-reddy-tells-ministers-to-spend-night-in-villages-hit-by-vizag-gas-leak/story-RKiU8YukkdcIQfP5Gqlo2L.html

He said that the states needed to be extra vigilant while giving them entry, or else, the infection is likely to spread across the nation.Thackeray has also batted for additional central forces in support of the state police to relieve them from stress. The CM said that the Centre should make the central security forces available whenever there is need. The Maharashtra CM apprised the PM about the steps taken by the state government in augmenting the bed, quarantine facilities at Racecourse, Nehru Science Centre, BKC and Goregaon Exhibition Centre in Mumbai. He expressed the need to encourage the pharmaceutical companies that are into the production of drugs related to Covid-19.

The lockdown was earlier scheduled to be lifted on May 3.The chief minister said coronavirus is going nowhere and it is impossible that cases of coronavirus will be zero.“Corona(virus) has come. It is impossible that there will be no cases of coronavirus because it has not happened across the country,” the CM said then.Union health minister Harsh Vardhan shot down his proposal of reopening Delhi.“It would not be right for me to comment as it will be seen as a political statement. On a personal level, I think a lot needs to be done to halt the spread of the coronavirus. In this lockdown 3, I think that minimum relaxations should be given by the Delhi government. But this decision has to be taken by the state. Guidelines have been issued by the home ministry but the states are free to decide,” the minister told reporters last week.Highlighting the adverse impact of coronavirus on the exchequer, Kejriwal said in April 2019, the government earned Rs 3,500 crore while in April this year, it only received Rs 300 crore. He said the Centre has put the entire Delhi under red zone due to which markets, malls cannot open.“We have suggested the Centre to seal those areas where cases of coronavirus have been reported and rest of areas can be allowed for the operation of all activities,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/allow-economic-activity-in-all-of-delhi-except-containment-zones-kejriwal-to-pm-modi/story-npels4quzAl2L6Oanvxk5I.html
11-05-2020||India||Single-judge bench to hear cases in Supreme Court, a first in 70 years||The Supreme Court will have single-judge benches hearing cases from May 13, the first time ever in its 70-year-old history. A notice announcing the same was published on the website of the apex court on Monday.Till now, benches in the top court used to sit in combinations of 2 judges to hear normal cases while special matters are heard by 3-judge benches. Cases involving constitutional questions are heard by benches composed of 5 or more judges.According to the new scheme, a single-judge bench will hear appeals arising out of bail and anticipatory bail cases involving offences which are punishable with less than 7 years of imprisonment.Besides, applications seeking transfer of cases from one high court to another or from trial court in one state to trial court in another state will also be heard by single-judge benches.The Supreme Court had amended its rules in September 2019 to allow single-judge benches to hear matters.Before the amendment, Order VI, Rule 1 of the Supreme Court Rules of 2013 stated that every case in the Supreme Court has to be heard by benches which comprise at least two judges.To pave the way for single-judge benches, a new clause was inserted in Order VI, Rule 1 of the Supreme Court Rules carving out an exception. After the amendment last year, this would be the first time the change is being implemented.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/single-judge-bench-to-hear-cases-in-supreme-court-a-first-in-70-years/story-Q9d98nBiD1uyO5t3fQgoRK.html
11-05-2020||India||Nirav Modi to be lodged in Mumbai’s Arthur Road jail, UK court told||Diamantaire Nirav Modi would be lodged in barrack number 12 of the Arthur Road jail in Mumbai after being extradited to India to face charges of financial fraud running into thousands of crores, the Westminster Magistrates Court was told on Monday.Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) lawyer Helen Malcolm, who is representing India in the court, informed district judge Samuel Mark Goozee that Modi would be placed in the same jail that was earmarked for businessman Vijay Mallya, who is also facing extradition.Malcolm, who opened the five-day extradition trial with a forensic account of Modi’s alleged lies and attempts to threaten and bribe witnesses, set out details of the financial fraud that included some officials of a Mumbai branch of the Punjab National Bank (PNB).Modi, 49, listened to the proceedings from the Wandsworth jail via video-link. His lawyer, Claire Montgomery, will open the defence from Tuesday morning, besides presenting witnesses, including expert Alan Mitchell, who deposed in the Mallya case on conditions in Indian prisons.Malcolm cited from named bank officials and cited documents to recount Modi’s alleged laundering of money and transfer of funds through accounts of members of his family, entities and properties in various countries, including in the United States.According to the CBI, Modi, brother Nehal Modi and two business associates tried to threaten witnesses and destroy evidence, which came to light after nine employees submitted details of how Modi and others took them to Cairo against their will, offered bribes and threatened them.India has submitted a cache of documents to substantiate its request for Modi’s extradition. The court was told that loans and credit were obtained by Modi and his companies fraudulently and when the fraud was discovered, Modi allegedly began a campaign to intimidate witnesses. Mobile phones and a server were destroyed, Malcolm said.Modi is now the subject of two extradition requests; one processed by the CBI and the other by the Enforcement Directorate (ED). The CBI case relates to large-scale fraud upon PNB, through the fraudulent obtaining of Letters of Understanding (LOUs/loan agreements); the ED case relates to the laundering of the proceeds of that fraud.The second extradition request was made on the basis of two additional offences as part of the CBI case. It was certified by home secretary Priti Patel on February 20 as required under the 1993 India-UK extradition treaty.The additional offences relate to allegations that Modi interfered with the CBI investigation by “causing disappearance of evidence” and intimidating witnesses (”criminal intimidation to cause death”). They have not been joined to the CBI case, but will be dealt with at a separate later hearing likely in July, the CPS said.Despite offering to raise the bail security amount to 4 million pounds, UK courts have refused Modi bail on the ground that he posed a flight risk and had the means to influence witnesses and tamper with evidence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nirav-modi-to-be-lodged-in-mumbai-s-arthur-road-jail-uk-court-told/story-xCK6Abc6xvSMLmSWbmp4LL.html

I request him to come back after spending 14 days at a quarantine centre.”According to West District Health Surveillance officer Dr. Sangeeta Chakraborty, people in the locality gathered to prevent Gobinda from entering into his flat while clearly not following social distancing norms.“ Police even failed to convince the residents and seeing no way, Gobinda was taken to a quarantine centre near capital city,” said Dr. Chakraborty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tripura-man-denied-entry-into-own-home-despite-being-tested-negative-for-covid-19/story-YjWH1oO2oQtytgJKKK2yDK.html
11-05-2020||India||Kashmir: Strict arrangements put in place as security forces fear attacks||Strict security arrangements were been put in place across Kashmir on Monday for the 17th day of the Holy month of Ramzan - or the day of Badr - as security forces feared there could be attacks on their installations in the region.Mobile internet connectivity, suspended last week since Hizbul Mujahideen’s operational commander Riyaz Naikoo was killed at his village of Beghpora in Pulwama along with an aide, is yet to be restored.Top officials said only the 2G services could be restored in Kashmir only after the 17th day of Ramzan passes off peacefully .People familiar with the situation said the government had decided to restore prepaid mobile phone services on Friday night. However, a high-level meeting in Srinagar, which was joined by top officials of security agencies, decided mobile internet connectivity would remain suspended till Monday.The day of Badr marked the first and decisive battle in the history of Islam, when the first few hundred Muslims led by Prophet Mohammed took on their powerful opponents in Arabia and won, according to Islamic tradition.“It was decided to restore internet only after the 17th day of Ramzan, the day of Badr, as there were inputs that security forces could be attacked on this day. Keeping in view the past experiences when militants choose to target security forces on this day, security was beefed up in Kashmir,” a senior security officer said.Last year too, there were similar reports about possible attacks on the 17th day of Ramzan. Keeping in view two attacks on the CRPF in north Kashmir’s Sopore and Handwara areas, which left six CRPF troopers dead and more than five injured, the officials had apprehensions that there could be similar attacks on the CRPF.During a high-level meeting in Baramulla last week, Kashmir IG Vijay Kumar had asked security forces, especially the CRPF, to remain on high alert and maintain extra vigil especially for road opening patrols and Naka duties to prevent attacks.The divisional commissioner of Kashmir, Pandurang K Pole, described the suspension of internet connectivity as temporary. “The mobile internet will be restored soon,” he said. Meanwhile, additional check points were set up on the national highway and other sensitive places, and messages were passed on to security installations to remain on high alert during the night due to possibility of attacks. The army’s Rashtriya Rifles units enhanced mobile patrolling in towns and villages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kashmir-strict-arrangements-put-in-place-as-security-forces-fear-attacks/story-QGHgcPV9mhG5DlnDqGCaLJ.html
11-05-2020||India||Uttarakhand shows 98% dip in forest area gutted this year compared to 2019||A fresh data released by the Uttarakhand forest department on the area affected by forest fires showed around 98% dip between April 5 and May 10, as compared to the corresponding period last year.In 2019, 675.84 hectares were gutted by the raging forest fires, but this year 12.03 hectares have been affected owing to the nationwide lockdown restrictions imposed since March 25 to contain the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak coupled with intermittent rainfall, said BK Gangte, nodal officer for forest fires in the state.“There is around 98% difference between the forest area affected till May 10, 2019, and this year. This is primarily due to two factors: intermittent rainfall maintaining the moisture level of the forests and the strict enforcement of lockdown restrictions,” said Gangte.In Uttarakhand, 0.17%, 1.60%, 9.32%, 21.66%, and 67.25% of total forest cover comes under extremely fire-prone, very highly fire-prone, highly moderately fire-prone, and less fire-prone categories, respectively.The state forest department is using innovative pine needle check-dam technology in a bid to reduce the forest fire incidents. This technology helps in reducing the forest fuel load, improves the soil-moisture regime, and enhances the water availability in remote areas in the hill state. Soil conservation technology also aids plant regeneration.The resin-rich pine needles are highly inflammable and have been found to be a major cause of forest fires.Parag Madhukar Dhakate, the chief conservator of forests (CCF) for western circle in Uttarakhand, said that the pine-needle check dam concept is being used in almost all the divisions of the hill state, including Nainital, Pithoragarh, Champawat, Tehri Garhwal, Almora, and Ranikhet among others.“A fire triangle of air, temperature, and fuel load is needed for forest fire incidents to occur. If even one of the factors from this triangle is removed, then such incidents can come down drastically. We can manage the fuel load, as temperature and air are beyond human control. Forest fires will reduce if the fuel load from pine needles is removed,” said Dhakate.“Pines account for around 50% of forests in Uttarakhand. Forest fire incidents have come down due to the making of check-dams that also prevent soil erosion. The water in the hills has a high calcium content, which over a period of time helps the making of check-dam from pine needles that solidify and, in turn, prevent soil erosion. Plant regeneration is the other spin-off factor,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-shows-98-dip-in-forest-fires-this-year-compared-to-2019/story-Wny8PBQIPLoSdVVCj8gUTJ.html

The BMS also asked states to reverse decisions to allow labour law holidays and changes to such legislations.States such as Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat announced a raft of changes to labour laws last week, from allowing longer working hours to a 1,000-day labour law holiday for new investors.In a statement issued on Monday, the labour wing of the RSS said state governments have been unable to convince the public as to how labour laws are hurdles to economic activities and about the emergent situation requiring the extreme step of suspending labour laws.“…On the contrary, for the labour, the Covid-19 situation has created an extraordinary situation of massive economic losses and job losses; losses of livelihood, besides financial, psychological and social issues. Urgent measures need to be taken to address this,” said a statement issued by BMS general secretary Vrijesh Upadhyay.Referring to the recent gas leak at a chemical plant in Visakhapatnam and the death of migrant workers sleeping on a railway track in Aurangabad as examples of the ”grave situation in the labour sector”, the BMS demanded the Union and state governments should make arrangements for free train travel by migrant workers.“Those workers who want to resume work should be given free transport facilities to workplaces in the absence of public transport. In green and orange zones, where activities have started in a phased manner, Government should give work support and support of wages,” the BMS demanded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bharatiya-mazdoor-sangh-asks-states-to-outline-post-covid-road-map-for-economic-activity/story-OTw1GvsaPV1ulMwxkEuJFO.html

The Army commander interacted with the commanders of the field formations and was briefed about the operational and logistics preparedness and plans to upgrade the security infrastructure,” said Jammu-based defence spokesperson Lt Col Devender Anand.He also interacted with troops and lauded them for their high morale and motivation.“He appreciated the high state of preparedness of the Rising Star Corps to thwart any threat manifested by inimical and anti-national elements. He also commended the efforts of the formations in the fight against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic,” Col Anand added.Lt Gen Singh’s visit to the strategic western border comes close on the heels of two back-to-back terror attacks in north Kashmir’s Kupwara district, where eight security personnel, including Col Ashutosh Sharma, Major Anuj Sood, a J&K Police sub-inspector, two soldiers and three Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel, were killed.Pakistan had reportedly increased its flying operations within its territory, as it fears retaliation from India after the recent attacks.Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan had also tweeted about a possible false flag operation by India after New Delhi stated that Islamabad was the brain behind a spurt in violence in Kashmir.“I have been warning the world about India`s continuing efforts to find a pretext for a false flag operation targeting Pakistan. The latest baseless allegations by India of `infiltration` across LoC are a continuation of this dangerous agenda,” Khan had tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/western-army-chief-visits-indo-pak-border-reviews-operational-preparedness/story-WNV014wy0aWvuFkGl1HeQM.html

11-05-2020||India||KCR opposes passenger trains, Jagan bats for restoring public transport||Telangana chief minister K Chandrashekar Rao on Monday appealed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi not to restore the passenger train services immediately as it could exacerbate Covid-19 infection across the country while his Andhra Pradesh counterpart Jagan Mohan Reddy sought the removal of all restrictions on public transport.At the Prime Minister’s video conference with the chief ministers of all the states to review the Covid-19 situation, Rao said several cities in the country, particularly major metropolises like Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Hyderabad, were still reeling under high incidence of coronavirus.“Under these circumstances, if passenger trains are operated, people in large numbers travel from one city to another and it is not possible to trace if there are any Covid-19 patients among them and who they get in touch with. It is not possible to conduct tests for everybody and it is also not possible to quarantine such a large number of train passengers. So, it is better to avoid running of passenger trains so hurriedly in the present circumstances,” the chief minister said.KCR, as Rao is better known, however, supported the Centre’s move to introduce Shramik Trains for ferrying migrant labourers to their native places. “It is natural for the workers, who are stranded in other states due to lockdown, to long for returning to their villages to see their families. If we stop them, it would unnecessarily lead to agitations. They will come back to work after spending some time with their families,” he said.He reminded that workers from Bihar who had gone back to their native places had returned to Telangana to work in rice mills. “So, we are also arranging special trains for migrant labourers who want to go back to their respective states,” he said.The chief minister said the lockdown on account of Covid-19 had a serious impact on the country’s economy and the revenues of the states. “No state in the country is in a position to repay its loans. The Centre should take initiative in rescheduling all their loans, just as banks reschedule recovery of crop loans,” he said, adding that the Centre should also increase the limit of borrowings by relaxing norms of Financial Restructuring and Budgetary Management Act.He also appealed to the Centre that the districts in Telangana which have not been reporting any positive/active cases for 14 days be designated green/orange zones to help restore economic activities in those areas.On the other hand, Andhra Pradesh chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy requested for restoration of public transport by removing all restrictions immediately. He said people should be allowed to take up their normal activity, whether they were migrant labourers or others who would like to attend to their duties.“Many migrant labourers have gone back to their native places and unless there is a public transport facility, they cannot come back to their workplaces and if it doesn’t happen, economic activity cannot come back to normal. However, adequate care should be taken to prevent spread of Covid-19,” he said.Jagan expressed concern over inadequate supply of raw material, which had severely affected the manufacturing sector in Andhra Pradesh “Since markets and retail sector are completely closed due to lockdown, there are no takers for agriculture products,” he said and demanded that the inter-state transport be allowed by removing all restrictions.The Andhra CM also suggested reopening of all shopping malls with adequate safeguards.“Standard Operating Procedures should be introduced to run commercial activity,” he said.Jagan also demanded liberal funds from the Centre to develop hospital and health infrastructure in the state which required at least Rs 16,000 crore. Besides, long-term loans with less or zero interest be given to the states without bringing them under FRBM purview.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kcr-opposes-passenger-trains-jagan-bats-for-restoring-public-transport/story-cERxDAbRuTwMasNHFRB3AL.html

11-05-2020||India||Covid-19: Rajasthan govt allows movement of people without pass||Jaipur: Rajasthan became the first state to allow free movement of people within the state between 7am and 7pm, except in containment zones, as states began relaxing norms a week before the third phase of the federal lockdown draws towards its scheduled end on May 17.“No pass will be required for interdistrict and within district movement of people between 7am and 7pm except in areas under curfew,” announced chief minister Ashok Gehlot after a meeting with legislators and members of Parliament.Gehlot authorised the district and subordinate officers to issue passes to people to travel by bus or train to other states and containment zones. Earlier, the state home department had this power. The new travel guideline also made a 14 day quarantine mandatory for any person entering the state. The guidelines also allowed district officers to give permission to run industries.While the Telangana government has extended the lockdown till May 29, it has given additional relaxations for private companies and industries located in the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation area, a red zone. They resumed operations on Monday.Cyberabad Commissioner of Police, VC Sajjannar, told industry owners have been allowed to use 33% of the manpower in a phased manner. “And this 33% of strength is across all shifts, including critical operations, during night hours, contract staff, etc,” he said.In Gujarat, the government decided to make the delivery of essential goods to home cashless from May 15, the first state to do so. “As a part of preparation strategy post lockdown, all retails and home deliveries agencies have been asked to get 100% screening of the staff. Those who get their staff screened would be able to run their operations without any hassle,” said an official order.The order also said that just to be abundantly cautious about the spread of the pandemic through currency notes, it has been made mandatory to accept digital mode of payment through unified payment interface and other platforms from May 15. So far, Gujarat has nearly 7,000 Covid-19 positive cases.In Uttarakhand, the government has allowed shops to function between 7am and 4pm, an extra three hours from this week. Government spokesperson and minister, Madan Kaushik, said, “We have increased the time limit of the opening of shops from 7am to 4pm in the state and more industries have been allowed to start operations.”However, Kerala, which has seen a new spurt of cases with expats returning, has decided against any relaxation for the time being. With train services also resuming, it expects more cases. Last Sunday it observed a complete shutdown, a symbolic move to strengthen its ongoing fight against the virus.In Rajasthan, a majority of MPs and MLAs welcomed the chief minister’s decision to bring stranded workers to their homes. The lawmakers suggested that additional trains and buses be arranged for them. They asked to simplify the pass process, arrange institutional quarantine for the people coming from other places to the village school or panchayat building and adding the names of new labourers to the MGNREGA list.On the demand of MPs and MLAs to remove the farmers’ welfare fee on purchases in agricultural markets, Gehlot said that the fee has not been imposed on the farmers but on the traders. The meeting was attended by speaker, Dr CP Joshi, former CM, Vasundhara Raje, leader of the opposition, Gulabchand Kataria, deputy leader of the opposition, Rajendra Rathore, and former Union minister, PP Chaudhary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-rajasthan-govt-allows-movement-of-people-without-pass/story-g8Qbj6tkn9sgYAkx6QlarM.html

But for Pankaj Kumar, who has always been a busy man, it was completely alien. However, rather then let his frustration get the better of him, he chose to venture out.For two weeks across the month of April, he drove daily from his home in Assagao in North Goa to Vasco in South Goa and then to Bicholim back in North Goa to help ensure that those in need could get one square meal a day. With government agencies struggling to put in place the arrangements for hundreds of people who found themselves without work and without food, stranded in the state, Kumar and his daughter Hiya Nandini began pooling together resources -- daily necessities like rice, atta and oil -- even before the government could mobilise, to ensure that no one went hungry. “All my life I’ve been extremely busy, but the lockdown kept me isolated within the four walls of my house while at the same time I began hearing stories of people being trapped in Goa without food and water. But what really got me to step out was a story about a man whose wife was pregnant and didn’t have access to food and water. That’s when we stepped out,” Kumar recalls. Over the next few weeks, Kumar began arranging for food to be delivered to the areas where migrants were being held up be it in temples or later in government shelters where they were provided accommodation but not food. “I used to drive up and down in my car one and a half hours everyday for the first few days until the government began to get its act together and arrange food. Even the deputy collector was surprised that I was doing this,” Kumar said. “I did what I could and that was to try and arrange for each of them to get one meal a day but the number kept growing. I used to deliver at Vasco da Gama and Bicholim where the labourers were being housed and the number of people soon grew to around 400-500,” Kumar recalled. “Wherever I tried to help, I used help of a local panch member or a government official in order to reach out to more people,” he said. As the government began to step in, Kumar began inquiring in his own village of Assagao and soon realised that there were many people including senior citizens staying alone. “Now since the government has stepped up its outreach and things have also opened up, we have focussed on two old-age homes as well as those who are in need in Saligao, as well as in my village of Assagao,” Kumar recalls. So far, Kumar has ended up spending around Rs 2 lakh on sourcing and distributing the food with a little help from his friends as well as starting a crowdfunding platform through the Ketto website. “It has been a very fulfilling experience, I used to volunteer during my early days with the Missionaries of Charity. These are people who even on a normal day struggle and manage to get by. I thought that I might just handhold them through the crisis,” he said. “There are many who are willing to help but do not know where to start,” Pankaj says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/one-car-4-000-meals-how-a-father-daughter-duo-in-goa-fed-those-in-need/story-0JMIbSpFbhnHypGxOZfVsJ.html
11-05-2020||India||In Goa, volunteers create web portal to help daily wagers find work during lockdown||A network of volunteers in Goa that was formed to provide food to the needy in the early days of lockdown has now gone a step further and helping them – mostly daily wage labourers – find work.The Goa Covid Outreach, which began as a relief service during the lockdown to curb the spread of Covid-19, also provides documentation services. “We started by doing delivery of rations for around 200 migrant labourers who were building the new high court complex opposite the secretariat and had been abandoned by the contractor. It began with the idea that we do some relief work and then let the government to take over,” said Miriam Koshy, an artist and former business student who is associated with the organisation. However, as the network and scale of the operation grew, the volunteers began to help document stranded migrants to hand over to the Goa government which had by then begun providing cooked food to stranded labourers in its relief efforts.Soon enough, the volunteers realised that they could put all the data they had gathered to good use. “We were anyway collecting data to give to the government, then we realised that to take what we are doing to a logical conclusion, we could help these labourers find work,” she said. “Now that the lockdown is partially lifted and the monsoon is approaching, many people are looking to repair the roofs of their houses or are looking to grow their own food or even doing rainwater harvesting. So our idea was to provide these available labourers to the community,” Koshy explained. The database set up on the website goacovidoutreach.in was quickly circulated amid the community and now hosts a pool of more than 1,500 people willing to do odd jobs that include painting, masonry, housekeeping, plumbing, carpentry, appliance repairs, car mechanics, etc. All these people were left without any work during the coronavirus pandemic. “As the government started taking over the primary relief operations, we thought that the best way to help them was to help them get on their own feet so that everybody’s needs can be met. That’s how the portal was born,” Koshy explained. The network is now also helping educate the labourers on the kind of central government and state government schemes they can avail of to help them during the lockdown.“There are literally hundreds of stories of agony from the migrants which we heard since we were engaging with them every day and we could see their anguish. But help has also come from all sides and we involved everyone at every level,” Koshy said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-goa-volunteers-create-web-portal-to-help-daily-wagers-find-work-during-lockdown/story-WgXE7m8nxpjsyLUhyP9LbP.html

Lodged in the Wandsworth prison since arrest in March 2019, Modi appeared in the trial via videolink.India has submitted a cache of documents to substantiate its request for Modi’s extradition to face charges for fraud amounting to over Rs 11,300 crore. Malcolm mentioned names of PNB officials while setting out the charges.The court was told that loans and credit were obtained by Modi and his companies fraudulently and when the fraud was discovered, Modi allegedly began a campaign to intimidate witnesses. Mobile phones and a server were destroyed, she said.Modi is now the subject of two extradition requests; one processed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the other by the Enforcement Directorate (ED). The CBI case relates to large-scale fraud upon PNB, through the fraudulent obtaining of Letters of Understanding (LOUs/loan agreements); the ED case relates to the laundering of the proceeds of that fraud.The second extradition request was made on the basis of two additional offences as part of the CBI case. It was certified by home secretary Priti Patel on February 20 as required under the 1993 India-UK extradition treaty.The additional offences relate to allegations that Modi interfered with the CBI investigation by “causing disappearance of evidence” and intimidating witnesses (”criminal intimidation to cause death”). They have not been joined to the CBI case, but will be dealt with at a separate later hearing likely in July, the CPS said.Despite offering to raise the bail security amount to 4 million pounds, UK courts have refused Modi bail on the ground that he posed a flight risk and had the means to influence witnesses and tamper with evidence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nirav-modi-s-extradition-trial-begins-uk-court-told-details-of-his-fraud/story-6KHIkOy4i20wl8yvqTIzyN.html

11-05-2020||India||Rajasthan: Over 1.6 lakh job cards added under MGNREGA in the past two months||Rajasthan topped the country on Monday as far as labour engagement under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) is concerned, as over 1.6 lakh new job cards under the scheme have been added in the past two months, state government officials said. On Monday morning, deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot, who holds the rural development portfolio, announced the state government’s unprecedented feat via a tweet amid the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak.“Rajasthan regained its first position in terms of labour engagement. It’s a matter of pride for us. We’re focusing on the job guarantee scheme to provide financial security to our rural population,” he tweeted.Reverse migration, trigged by the pandemic, has led to an uptick in new enrolment under the rural job scheme.Data showed that 105 lakh MGNREGA job cards were available in the desert state as on March 20, five days before the nationwide lockdown restrictions were imposed to contain the spread of Covid-19 outbreak and on Monday this figure has risen by another 1.6 lakh.“Usually, the number of job cards remains static. An increase in 2 lakh cards per year is considered to be normal. But 1.6 lakh new job cards in two months is unprecedented,” said PC Kishan, commissioner, MGNREGA, Rajasthan. “Lakhs of migrant labourers have returned to their native villages and are registering for job cards and work under the MGNREGA,” he added.He cited last year’s data, which showed that 102 and 103 lakh job cards were added between April 29 and May 30, respectively --- a normal annual trend.“Usually, this kind of increase in MGNREGA job cards occurs in a year. For example, there were 103 lakh cards in 2019, and it rose to 104 lakh this year. Besides the migrants returning home, even local villagers are seeking job under the scheme because of lack of employment opportunities in the state,” said Nikhil Dey, a social activist.“Many people, who never thought about the scheme as a viable employment option, are making a beeline for it, as jobs are few and far between. We’ve been demanding a disaster management employment guarantee scheme for a crisis situation like this,” he added.The Ashok Gehlot-led Congress government said that it would issue job cards to all migrant labourers and engage them under the MGNREGA.“Our next milestone is 30 lakh job cards and the final target is 35 lakh, which can be achieved by developing around 100,000 green assets in the field with an increased focus on natural resource management (NRM) and activities allied to the farm sector,” Kishan said.The state government had sanctioned a pasture, playground, crematorium or burial ground and model pond in each of the 10,000-odd gram panchayats last year under the MGNREGA, which was introduced by the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government at the Centre in 2005.“This year, we’re focusing on implementing these four kinds of tasks in each of the 43,000 revenue villages,” Kishan added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-over-1-6-lakh-job-cards-added-under-mgnrega-in-the-past-two-months/story-SRCnQm0qwFuCD0LNweWY1K.html
11-05-2020||India||At 15-minute Punjab Cabinet meet, ministers want chief secretary to be sacked||Punjab cabinet ministers on Monday asked Chief Minister Amarinder Singh to sack chief secretary Karan Avtar Singh and declared that they would not attend cabinet meetings as long as he attends these meetings.Karan Avtar Singh had taken on the ministers at a pre-cabinet meeting on the excise policy on Saturday, insisting that the changes recommended by the ministers to the policy could not be taken on board. The face-off had led to ministers storming out of the meeting on Saturday; finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal was the first one to walk out. Saturday’s cabinet meeting was deferred to Monday.At an informal meeting ahead of the cabinet meeting, the ministers decided to stand their ground and walk out of the meeting if the chief secretary is present.The chief secretary was advised to stay away from Monday’s cabinet meeting and additional chief secretary (home) Satish Chandra was tasked to officiate in his absence.As soon as Monday’s cabinet meeting started, the ministers told chief minister Amarinder Singh that they would not attend cabinet meetings in case the chief secretary is present.This could be a little problematic. According to the rulebook, the chief secretary of a state is also the secretary to the cabinet, coordinates all meetings of the cabinet and signs off on the official records.“The chief minister has accepted our demand because he asked all of us to bring our grouse on record,” said Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, the minister of cooperation and jails, told Hindustan Times.“Manpreet (finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal) and I said that the behavior of the chief secretary is not acceptable. He is rude and doesn’t understand that officers and elected representatives are two sides of a coin,” technical education minister Charanjeet Singh Channi told HT.Channi said the chief secretary had been rude to him in the past too and had even questioned his integrity.Channi said the chief minister had promised to act.A senior Punjab minister said the chief secretary Karan Avtar Singh had signalled that he was ready to apologise to bury the hatchet. But Manpreet Singh Badal has insisted that he isn’t game.“Some ministers want to give the chief secretary a second chance but the finance minister is adamant,” said a cabinet minister on conditions of anonymity.The row over the chief secretary has its origin in a pre-cabinet meeting held on Saturday when minister Charanjit Channi demanded that someone be held accountable for the loss of revenue due to the state’s flawed excise policy. Chief secretary Karan Avtar Singh, who found some of the suggestions made by ministers to be unacceptable, reminded the minister that policies are only implemented after the approval of the ministers.Finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal promptly shot back at the official’s reply that was perceived to be too curt.“If the officers have already made up their mind on the policy, what was the fun of discussing the matter with the ministers?” Badal said moments before storming out of the meeting. Other ministers also left soon after.On the agenda item that was before the cabinet, the ministers decided to authorise chief minister Amarinder Singh to take the decision. The liquor contractors in the state want the government to compensate them for the 45 days that liquor vends had to be closed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/either-him-or-us-punjab-ministers-vs-chief-secretary-plays-out-at-cabinet-meet/story-AfQ6fBlByZ8nwBU6w2YOfK.html

The state government has been bringing its migrants from various states of the country in buses and trains. It has brought back about 34,000 migrants till Monday morning by state transport buses with 2,400 more to reach after the first two special trains left Surat and Pune Monday. A senior government official privy to the developments in the evacuation of migrants said on the condition of anonymity, “The state government is expecting the return of at least 3 lakh migrants back with every online registration comprising about two-three persons each on average.”The official said, “Though the government had shown its commitment to bring all of them, it will be a Herculean task for it considering the limited resources of the small Himalayan state.”Estimating the number of buses and trains required to bring all of them, he said that “At least 100 trains and 3,000 buses will be needed to bring all of them while maintaining precautions amid the pandemic.”“The government at present is working on a war footing with most of the available resources being pressed in the evacuation. We have been already running buses from Rajasthan, Haryana, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh where most of our residents are stranded. In the far away states like Gujarat, Maharashtra, Telangana and Kerala, we had asked for special trains which are being run gradually,” said the official. He also said that there is also another challenge of taking the migrants to their home within the state once they reach here from outside. “Resources are needed not only to bring them back but also to send them home in the state. And this is to be done after all those mandatory screening and precautions in which thousands of our health workers are involved,” he said. Chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat also acknowledged that the state faces a big challenge because many of those returning to the state would be infected. “The state is expecting at least 2-2.25 lakh migrants to return of which about 25,000 are expected to be infected.”Minister and government spokesperson Madan Kaushik who has been monitoring the evacuation process and state’s response to the pandemic, refused to reveal the total number of migrants who have registered with the government to return. “We cannot reveal the total number of migrants but the total number of registration which is about 1.87 lakhs. But yes, it is a big challenge for our government to bring all our residents safely while following the precautions,” said Kaushik.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-faces-huge-covid-19-challenge-as-3-lakh-migrants-prepare-to-return-home/story-0iWLPBKzrSeByhZif8u8bM.html

Aggressive behaviour by the two sides resulted in minor injuries to troops,” the Indian army statement said.The troops disengaged after talks held at the local army level.The Chinese foreign ministry, however, did not share specifics of the incident.“Chinese Border troops have always been upholding peace and tranquility along our border areas. China and India stay in close communication and coordination concerning our border affairs within existing channels,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian said at the regular ministry briefing on Monday.“This year marks the 70th anniversary of our establishment of diplomatic ties and the two countries are joining hands in the fight against Covid-19,” he said.“Under such circumstances the two sides should work together with each other, properly manage and handle the differences, earnestly uphold peace and stability in the border region so as to create enabling conditions for our bilateral relations as well as the joint fight against Covid-19,” Zhao added.Zhao denied that China is adopting an aggressive approach in its diplomacy as it fights off the Covid-19 in the country.“The relevant assumption is groundless,” he said, answering a question on the subject.“Since the outbreak of the Covid-19, China and India have been staying in close communication and cooperation on prevention and control, to jointly meet the challenges. Now, the most pressing concern for the international community is solidarity and cooperation against Covid-19. We shouldn’t allow any politicisation or stigmatisation in a bid to create more differences or confrontation,” Zhao said.India and China have held dozen rounds of talks to resolve the 3,488 km of disputed border stretching from Jammu and Kashmir to Arunachal Pradesh.In 2017, China had accused India of trespassing and preventing its troops from building a road in the Himalayan plateau Doklam (Donglang in Chinese), which is under Chinese control but claimed by Bhutan.The standoff began in June and ended in August after troops from both armies withdrew.Speaking to state-controlled media, a Chinese scholar said the China-India border issue was left over from the past and both sides have a different perception.“Despite this, the two countries’ leaderships and related authorities have established communication mechanisms. Their effectiveness was demonstrated by this incident as the problem was solved at the local level and did not escalate to a national level,” Qian Feng, a senior fellow at the Taihe Institute and director of the research department of the National Strategy Institute at Tsinghua University in Beijing told state media.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/should-work-together-fight-covid-19-china-to-india-after-sikkim-face-off/story-jfIylTI1T71y1TLfFutWAN.html

11-05-2020||India||Bihar sends homes stranded Kashmiri traders, migrants from Bengal and Jharkhand||The Patna district administration brought back smiles on the faces of nearly 160 stranded people, mostly migrant workers by facilitating their return home in the last three days.All these people were scheduled to leave Patna after March 24, but found themselves stranded due to the lockdown.Among them were 107 migrant labourers from West Bengal, 30-35 workers from Jharkhand’s Godda district, 17 Kashmiri woollen hawkers and a three-member group from Srinagar that was here to attend a marriage.Most of them had registered with the helpline numbers of their respective states hoping to be bailed out. They were running low on hope as they continued to be stranded in Bihar almost a month since their registration for help. Every passing day was proving to be a mental and financial drain.Patna district magistrate Kumar Ravi took up the case for evacuation of the stranded people after Hindustan Times highlighted the plight of Kashmiri woollen hawkers last week. “I tried to get buses arranged and contacted officials of their state. When my officers got in touch with their counterparts, they got to know that two buses were coming, carrying stranded pilgrims to Bihar. The same bus was used for the return of the Kashmiri people stranded in Patna,” said Ravi.“(Rohit Raj) assistant commissioner, labour resources department, worked hard to coordinate it. The driver and staff of the bus, which came to Patna, were very reluctant…” he added.“It was the cheapest and safest option available. We have informed the officers of J&K about every development orally,” said Ravi, when this reporter asked him about their payment. Each Kashmiri had to pay the bus staff ₹2,500 for their return up to Jammu.The Patna district administration screened all passengers and gave them food packets and drinking water before the Kashmiri entourage left Patna on Sunday evening.“We also facilitated the return of 107 migrant labourers by three buses from Bihta block in Patna to West Bengal on May 9. Today, we are trying to send back to Godda 30-35 migrant workers in a bus, which has come along with a magistrate, from Jharkhand,” said Rohit Raj, assistant labour commissioner.It was not easy for the Kashmiris, most of who had been coming to Bihar for the past two decades, to cope with Bihar’s oppressive summer.“We are not used to such heat and were developing rashes on our skin, as our return was delayed by a month-and-a-half,” said Md Shafi Bhawani, 45, who was among the 17-member group of Kashmiri hawkers.“We are thankful to the Bihar government for facilitating our return home, we so desperately wanted to during the holy month of Ramzan,” said Nawaz Amin Bhawani, 35, whose marriage is scheduled in June.The joy on the face of Gulshna Akhtar, who is Md Shafi’s spouse, said it all.“A mother can only realise the pangs of separation from her small children. I’ll get to meet my children after two months,” she said. Her children — Bashrat Shafi (18), Saima Shafi (15) and Fida Hussain (10) — who came to tour the hinterlands of Bihar, had left for Srinagar after Holi, in anticipation of their schools reopening. The couple, however, stayed back to collect some outstanding payments, which some of its customers owed, and got stuck during lockdown.Around 8,000 people from outside Bihar were stranded in the state due to the lockdown, as per information available with Bihar’s disaster management department till May 4.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-sends-homes-stranded-kashmiri-traders-migrants-from-bengal-and-jharkhand/story-I6h93RtSWowR4Xs0bXnAYJ.html

We are surrounded by international borders and other bigger states and have challenges to deal with,” Banerjee said at the video-conference with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.“All the states should be given equal importance and we should work together as Team India,” she said, adding that the federal structure should be respected.The Centre had recently rapped the West Bengal government over its Covid-19 management which, it said, was characterised by a very low rate of testing in proportion to the population, and the highest mortality rate in the country - of 13.2 per cent.The state government, however, said less number of active cases was detected in the initial days due to lack of infrastructure, and this resulted in an apparently high rate of deaths in the state.The Centre had also come down heavily on the Mamata Banerjee government for not allowing movement of goods traffic through border crossings between India and Bangladesh that could jeopardise India’s international commitments to the neighbouring country.In a scathing letter to West Bengal chief secretary Rajiva Sinha, Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla said that by doing so, West Bengal was not just violating the ministry of home affairs’ orders under Disaster Management Act including the guidelines but also Articles 253, 256 and 257 of the Constitution of India. Article 253 of the Constitution deals with the legislation for giving effect to international agreements while articles 256 and 257 give powers to the Centre for issuing directions to the state that are obligatory for latter.He reminded the state government of lockdown measures issued on May 1 according to which no state/union territory shall stop movement of cargo for cross-border land trade under treaties with neighbouring countries.After this, the West Bengal government suggested that trade between India and Bangladesh can continue through Gede in south Bengal’s Nadia district during the coronavirus lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-should-not-play-politics-mamata-banerjee-at-video-conference-with-pm-modi/story-CHt3L107ucbYhfHj1ApaNI.html

State governments have played a major role in this fight. They have understood their responsibility and served their roles in countering this threat,” the Prime Minister said.“We stressed that people should stay where they are. But it’s human nature to want to go home and so we had to modify or change our decisions. Despite that, we have to make sure that the disease doesn’t spread and go to villages, that’s our big challenge,” he added talking about the movement of migrants.This is PM Modi’s fifth video-conference with the chief ministers on tackling the Covid-19 outbreak.Home Minister Amit Shah, who was also present in the meeting, highlighted the importance of the Aarogya Setu mobile application and urged the chief ministers to popularise its download as it will help in tracking the spread of the virus.At the previous meetings, the Prime Minister has taken suggestions from chief ministers on the contours and extension of the national lockdown, put in place to check the spread of infections.Cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba met state chief secretaries on Sunday and advised them to ensure that “green zones” - areas that are largely Covid-19-free - remain insulated from the spread of the pathogen, according to an official who was present during the interaction and spoke on condition of anonymity.

11-05-2020||India||Nepal summons Indian envoy to protest opening of road to Lipulekh||The Nepal government summoned the Indian envoy on Monday to protest against the construction of a road in Lipulekh area that is claimed by Kathmandu, signalling an intensification of the diplomatic row on the matter.India has on Saturday rejected Nepal’s initial protest against the construction of a road to Lipulekh on the border with China, saying the region is “completely within the territory of India” and both sides could resolve such boundary issues through diplomatic dialogue.People familiar with developments said India’s envoy Vinay Mohan Kwatra was summoned to the foreign ministry in Kathmandu, where foreign minister Pradeep Gyawali handed over a diplomatic note of protest.The foreign ministry also tweeted: “Foreign Minister Hon. @PradeepgyawaliK conveyed Government of Nepal’s position on boundary issues to Ambassador of India to Nepal H.E. Mr. Vinay Mohan Kwatra at a meeting held at MoFA today and handed over a diplomatic note in this regard.”No further details were immediately available. There was no immediate response to the development from Indian officials.The border row erupted months after Nepal was irked by the depiction of Kalapani as part of Uttarakhand in new Indian maps showing the union territory of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh. Nepal had sought talks to address the Kalapani issue but New Delhi rejected Kathmandu’s protest, saying the new maps accurately depict Indian territory.Earlier on Monday, Gyawali said Nepal could not wait for the end of the Covid-19 crisis for holding boundary talks with India. Gyawali, who was summoned by the Parliament’s international relations committee, also said Nepal will hold talks with China after sorting out the issue with India, The Kathmandu Post reported.The parliamentary panel had summoned Gyawali to discuss the opening of the road to Lipulekh by the Indian government last week.“Nepal, India and China are yet to ascertain the tri-junction in Lipulekh. So after talks with India, we will hold talks with China as well,” Gyawal told the committee.“We are ready for talks at any level with India – at the prime minister’s level or foreign secretary-level,” he added.On Saturday, Nepal had expressed regret at the inauguration of the route from Dharchula in Uttarakhand to Lipulekh, with the foreign ministry contending the road “passes through Nepali territory”.Defence minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated the 80-km road on Friday to curtail the time taken for the pilgrimage to Kailash-Mansarovar. The road ends at Lipulekh Pass, and will help pilgrims avoid dangerous high-altitude routes through Sikkim and Nepal.“The recently inaugurated road section in Pithoragarh district in the state of Uttarakhand lies completely within the territory of India. The road follows the pre-existing route used by the pilgrims of the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava had said.India and Nepal have an established mechanism for boundary issues, and the delineation of the border with Nepal is ongoing, Srivastava said. India is also committed to resolving outstanding boundary issues through diplomatic dialogue, he said.Nepal’s foreign ministry had sought talks between the foreign secretaries and Srivastava had said the two side are in the process of scheduling these talks, which would be held after they have dealt with the Covid-19 crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nepal-summons-indian-envoy-to-protest-opening-of-road-to-lipulekh/story-OXCVKTo0Mgewms66pOVU2J.html

This led to clashes between the two groups.As the news got out, Nirmal district superintendent of police C Shashidhar Raju and Karimnagar range Deputy Inspector General P Pramod Kumar rushed to Bhainsa to review the situation.Around 200 and 300 policemen and a rapid action force was deployed for preventing untoward incidents. Commercial establishments remained closed on Monday.“One person was injured in the clashes and a few vehicles got damaged, including window panes of a four-wheeler,” Shashidhar Raju told Hindustan Times. He said the situation was completely under control.“So far, 25 people have been taken into custody. Police pickets posted in the town and prohibitory orders under Section 144 of Criminal Procedure Code have been promulgated in the town. Lockdown will be implemented more strictly in Bhainsa,” the SP said.As the groups attacked each other with stones and sticks, the police, patrolling to enforce the lockdown, entered the scene, dispersed the agitators and brought the situation under control.Bhainsa witnessed large scale violence between two groups at Korbagalli area of the town on January 13 this year, in which at least 10 people and four policemen were injured. Scores of houses were gutted in arson and several vehicles were burnt in the clashes.As many as 59 persons were arrested for their alleged role in the riots and internet services were disconnected in the entire district.“The latest incident is just a stray one, compared to the communal clashes in January,” Shashidhar Raju said.In 2008, communal violence claimed nine lives, including six members of a family in Bhainsa town.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dispute-over-social-distancing-results-in-clashes-in-telangana-25-held/story-Z0JU7ywUWcjf86UibPgFQK.html

11-05-2020||India||In Bihar, migrants testing positive for Covid-19 pose new challenge||An alarmed Bihar government is gearing up to face the rising number of cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in the state, especially after trainloads of mostly asymptomatic migrant labourers came back and many of them tested positive. Bihar has seen the number of Covid-19 cases rise steadily and it has picked up in the last 10 days, coinciding with the return of migrants. There were just 66 cases of the coronavirus disease in the state on April 14 and now it has reached 646, with 119 cases adding from May 5-10, mostly from amongst migrant workers. Sanjay Kumar, principal secretary of the department of health, said out of the 49 people who tested positive on Saturday 44 are migrants and had come back from different parts of the country.Chief minister Nitish Kumar has already directed officials to do random testing in districts and strengthen isolation wards at the block level with more beds and facilities, as the number is set to grow.“The focus has now shifted to the panchayat and block levels, as it is where the migrants will spend their mandatory 21 days at the isolation centres. The figures say that Bihar will need to move more cautiously now with migrants, including those from foreign countries, returning in large numbers,” a minister, who did not want to be named, said.“We got a hint of it long before special trains started running, as some people still managed to reach the state through makeshift arrangements or on foot and later tested positive despite being asymptomatic. Some of the districts reported their first case through migrants and later more cases were detected during contact tracing,” the minister added.The spread has engulfed the entire state—from just 12 districts in Bihar with Covid-19 cases at the end of the first phase of the lockdown to 30 at the end of the second and 37 of the 38 districts midway through the third phase—raising concerns for the government machinery.Bihar has an estimated 40-45-lakh migrant population working across several states, though there is no definite statistics on it. More than 29 lakh migrants had registered with the Bihar government app to avail Rs 1000 assistance to them, though the number is expected to be much higher. “We knew the challenging phase for the state will begin with a large number of migrants returning to their native places and the government has made plans accordingly on the lines of what the state did during Kosi tragedy,” said a senior official of the government. “The chief minister has clearly directed that all facilities should be provided to the migrant labourers so that they also cooperate in respecting the mandatory quarantine for their own good and for the safety of others,” the official cited above said.“He has said that with Covid-19, there was no room for any complacency at any level and the people should also be made aware of the seriousness without creating any scare so that they come forward to cooperate with testing and screening,” the official added.In rural Bihar, the number of households reporting out-migration per 1000 households reporting outmigration was 745 – much higher than the all-India average of 365. In the urban area, it was 614 against the national average of 240, says a study by Tata Institute of Social Sciences’ (TISS) Patna centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-bihar-migrants-testing-positive-for-covid-19-pose-new-challenge/story-QOHsl4p3X0cWOCyqzHVAdJ.html

They’ve been lodged at a quarantine centre in Angul district,” the SP said.In a separate incident, a bus carrying 30 migrants from Odisha, who were coming home from Tamil Nadu’s Kanchipuram district, dropped 15 of them in Cuttack town on Monday morning instead of taking them to a quarantine centre in Jagatsinghpur district. The authorities put up six of them at a Cuttack college, which has been converted into a quarantine centre, and the remaining nine travelled to Jagatsinghpur district in an auto-rickshaw. The state government had announced three days ago that it would be mandatory for returning migrant workers to be quarantined for 28 days after it took note of a longer incubation period for the Sars-CoV-2 virus that causes the disease.The return of migrant to Odisha from Gujarat, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka has been blamed for a spike in Covid-19 positive cases over the past fortnight including 300 of the total of 391 reported from the state so far.There have also been incidents of migrants fleeing quarantine centres in Odisha in the past week. For instance, 150 migrants in Ganjam district’s Beguniapada block fled the quarantine centre because of the poor quality of food and lack of potable water in the facility.Some migrants from coastal Bhadrak district, who came back from Gujarat’s Surat, got off the bus several kilometres ahead of the quarantine centre and went directly to their homes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/20-odisha-migrant-workers-jump-off-train-to-evade-quarantine/story-04DcfpA7rA1xnXu69bLWHP.html

The court was hearing a plea by an advocate named Alok Alakh Shrivastava who had sought directions to the Delhi government to remove Islam from the chairman’s post.Following submissions, the court said that since the Delhi government is taking action, there is no need to pass any order.A bench of justices Rajiv Sahai Endlaw and Sangita Dhingra Sehgal disposed of the plea directing the government to expeditiously decide the matter because Islam is retiring on July 30.In his plea, Shrivastava had said that the social media post made by Islam was provocative, deliberate and seditious, intended to cause disharmony and create a rift in the society.“By making such hateful statement, the Respondent No 4 (Islam) who is holding such a responsible post, has endangered the unity and integrity of the country, tried to tarnish the secular image of India and spread hatred among two communities,” the plea had said. A detailed order in the matter would be later uploaded on the high court’s website.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/notice-issued-to-delhi-minorities-panel-chief-over-controversial-social-media-post-court-informed/story-IuF6zZFHoOG02RMx3CEYqI.html

We are fighting together against Corona[virus], but this cannot be an excuse to trample human rights, allow unsafe workplaces, exploit workers and suppress their voices. We cannot compromise on the basic principles [protecting the rights of workers],” tweeted the Congress leader in Hindi. Earlier, eight political parties wrote to President Ram Nath Kovind protesting the changes to labour laws, including extending the daily working hours from eight to twelve in six States, on the grounds of fighting the Covid-19 pandemic.Also Watch | ‘Deposit Rs 7,500 in poor people’s accounts immediately’: Rahul Gandhi The BJP-ruled Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, two states with substantial workforces, have frozen major labour laws, except basic ones, in the hope that businesses will recoup from the blow of the Covid-19 pandemic and create more jobs on a net basis.The changes give industries more flexibility in hiring and firing employees, determining their wages, and reduce their liabilities in terms of providing employee benefits. Some economists welcomed the move for clearing structural bottlenecks, possibly leading to greater investment, creating employment opportunities for migrant workers returning home, and positioning India to be able to take advantage of disruptions in global supply chains.The move, however, also sparked intense criticism from the Opposition, particularly left parties, trade unions including those affiliated to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, and civil society activists for undermining worker rights, removing decades-old protective measures and slowly dismantle the welfare architecture.To be sure, 90% of India’s workforce, which is employed in the informal sector, won’t be affected by these changes. These apply to those who are in the organised workforce and registered firms.UP suspended key labour laws for three years on May 6 through an ordinance, even as MP announced on May 7 it was taking a similar course to put all labour laws on hold, barring some provisions of the Factories Act, 1948, for the next 1,000 days. The move comes after the BJP held consultations with stakeholders back in April.Uttarakhand labour minister Harak Singh Rawat said his state too was contemplating “similar moves” to give exemptions to industry to help them deal with losses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/can-t-exploit-workers-stifle-voices-rahul-gandhi-on-labour-laws-dilution/story-FKfjfPDizJsQ3kcSdJHevM.html

Nearly 40% of the committed assistance has been delivered, the rest will reach the SAARC countries this week, a foreign ministry official said.Apart from medical aid, India has also sent teams of medical personnel called Rapid Response Teams to Kuwait and Maldives, is setting up, conducting webinars to train personnel in other countries and extend technical assistance in other formats.

The Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress government in Bengal has, however, decided to make an exception because the couple will be carrying Covid, their first child born on Sunday morning, back home.The state government will bear all the hospital expenses for the birth of Covid in a bid to celebrate Mother’s Day on Sunday.Bibi (21), who was in her advanced stage of pregnancy, was stopped, along with her husband and some other labourers, on Sunday, when they were found trying to sneak into Assam on the back of a truck. Police personnel, who had stopped the vehicle at Ethelbari checkpoint in Bengal’s Alipurduar district, and some healthcare staff rushed Bibi to Birpara General Hospital in central Dooars, as she was writhing in labour pain. The doctors and nurses at the hospital named the baby boy Covid after the raging pandemic that has brought life to a standstill across the world.The labourers were travelling from Jalpaiguri district’s Binnaguri to Bhumabari in lower Assam’s Kokrajhar district. “Some police personal and healthcare staff took Bibi to the hospital, where the baby was born,” said Amitava Maity, superintendent of police (SP), Alipurduar. “We contacted the Kokrajhar SP immediately after we stopped the truck. It’s a proud moment for us, as we could help a woman give birth to a baby on Mother’s Day,” said Maity. Covid’s parents are impressed with the West Bengal Police.“My wife could give birth safely because the police helped us. They gave us baby soaps, clothes, food and some money as well. I shall never forget their kind gesture,” said Rahman. “We had a wrong notion about policemen. Sunday’s incident has changed that perception for good,” he added.“The baby was born at 11.25am on Sunday, and weighs 2.44 kg. The mother and the baby are doing fine. All hospital expenses are being borne by the state health department,” said Puran Sharma, chief medical officer of health, Alipurduar district.“The state administration will send the couple home in an ambulance after the woman gets discharged from the hospital,” said a senior district official, who did not want to be identified.The other stranded labourers have been sent to Assam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/migrant-worker-from-assam-gives-birth-in-bengal-on-mother-s-day-names-boy-covid/story-0igqQdHP5rFvMTVFQt6TfL.html

India’s Covid-19 cases breached the 67,152 mark on Monday. Amid the nationwide coronavirus lockdown, which will come to an end on May 17, the government has decided to start some interstate passenger trains from May 12. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will hold a meeting with chief ministers later in the day over the prevailing coronavirus situation in the country.Here are the top developments:1.

11-05-2020||India||Railways allows more passengers, three stops for Shramik Specials||Indian Railways on Monday approved an increase in the number of passengers allowed on board Shramik Special trains it is running for migrant workers returning home after being stranded by the post-Covid-19 lockdown, and allowed the trains to make three stops en route to their destinations.Shramik Specials, which have so far been running without any stops on the way, are now allowed carry up to 1,700 people. The special trains have 24 coaches, each with 72 seats. Until now, only 54 people have been allowed in each coach, with the middle berth left empty to maintain social distancing, meaning each train carried about 1,200 passengers. According to the new guidelines issued by Indian Railways, a copy of which was reviewed by Hindustan Times, a train’s capacity should now be equal to the number of sleeper berths it has.The Union home ministry, meanwhile, asked all states and Union territories to cooperate with the railways in running more Shramik Special trains, which started on May 1 after state governments requested the Centre to facilitate the return of migrant workers stranded in various parts of the country because of the lockdown imposed on March 25 for the Covid-19 pandemic. “I urge upon you all to allow receiving of all Shramik Special trains without any hindrance and facilitate faster movement of stranded migrant workers to their native places,” a letter written by home secretary Ajay Bhalla to state and Union Territory administrations said. He also asked states and Union territories to ensure that migrant workers do not resort to walking on the roads and rail tracks and use the special trains for travel home.The developments came a day after railway minister Piyush Goyal said Indian Railways had geared up to run 300 trains a day to ferry migrant labourers to their hometowns. He also appealed to the states to ramp up efforts to ensure these workers reach their destinations across the country in the next three-four days.“The minister has appealed to all states, especially states that have allowed very few trains (so far)...Same was discussed in the home secretary’s VC (video conference) with states yesterday (Sunday), and he has written a letter to them. The home minister (Amit Shah), in particular, has appealed to West Bengal, which has very low numbers (of trains that it has approved),” a railway ministry spokesperson said. According to the ministry, West Bengal, which has a significant number of migrant labourers, has allowed two trains so far, and later approved two special trains each from Punjab and Tamil Nadu, three from Karnataka and one from Telangana. West Bengal has previously denied that it was dragging its feet in facilitating the return of migrants home Until May 11, a total of 468 Shramik Special trains had run from various states. Of them, 363 reached their destinations: Andhra Pradesh (1 train), Bihar (100 trains), Himachal Pradesh (1 train), Jharkhand (22 trains), Madhya Pradesh (30 trains), Maharashtra (3 trains), Odisha (25 trains), Rajasthan (4 trains), Telangana (2 trains), Uttar Pradesh (172 trains), West Bengal (2 trains) and Tamil Nadu (1 train). The remaining 105 were in transit, the ministry said. Experts have suggested that the total number of stranded migrants is far more than government estimates. According to the Economic Survey 2016-17 that used new metrics to give updated data on migration, there was an annual interstate migration flow of close to 9 million from 2011 to 2016 in a “circular” fashion (to and from), based on the data from the railways. In the first week of April, a status report submitted by the Centre to the Supreme Court said a little over a million migrant workers and others were housed at 26,476 relief and active shelter camps across the country. Of them, 630,000 were in government camps and the rest in those run by non-government organisations.The railways will also begin passenger services gradually with trains to 15 destinations from May 12, the government announced on Sunday, green-lighting the resumption of these operations close to two months after it stopped them as part of a strategy to slow the spread of the coronavirus disease.Bookings for these trains — all of them will start from the New Delhi Railway Station — will begin at 4pm on Monday only on the website of the Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC).These trains will run to Dibrugarh (Assam), Agartala (Tripura), Howrah (West Bengal), Patna (Bihar), Bilaspur (Chhattisgarh), Ranchi (Jharkhand), Bhubaneswar (Odisha), Secunderabad (Telangana), Bengaluru (Karnataka), Chennai (Tamil Nadu), Thiruvananthapuram (Kerala), Madgaon (Goa), Mumbai Central (Maharashtra), Ahmedabad (Gujarat) and Jammu Tawi (Jammu and Kashmir).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/railways-allows-up-to-1-700-passengers-in-shramik-specials-three-stoppages/story-gcGKDR49etBWtS4ducF5pK.html

Both of them tested positive for the respiratory disease. They have been now sent to the Covid-19 hospital in Haldwani. Neeraj Khairwal, US Nagar’s district magistrate, has ordered an inquiry into the matter.“This is a case of direct dereliction of duty and a serious matter. I have ordered an inquiry into the case and action will be taken accordingly against the accused health officials. People who came into their contact after they were sent home have also been kept in isolation now,” Khairwal said.The two patients from Mahtosh village of Gadarpur had come from Maharashtra on a three-wheeler on Wednesday. They were intercepted by Pulbhatta Police in Kichha while crossing the inter-state border.Health officials checked them and sent them to Pantnagar for quarantine. Later, they were shifted to the Rudrapur district hospital for isolation.Doctors discharged them on Friday evening when the sample reports received from Dehradun said their samples had tested negative. But their test results positive came on Saturday.Both the patients were then called back to the hospital and put under isolation. Later, they were shifted to the Covid-19 hospital in Haldwani and others who came into their contact were identified and quarantined.“It happened due to confusion. We receive sample reports daily from Dehradun. Nodal officer of these Covid-19 patients was at Radha Swamy Satsang quarantine centre on Kichha road on Friday when the reports were received,” Dr TD Rakholia, chief medical superintendent (CMS) of the district hospital, said.Dr Rakholia said the nodal officer received a message that all the reports were normal following which he asked his staff that quarantined people should be discharged.“Quarantined people are also creating problems by pressurising us to discharge them immediately for home quarantine. In confusion, the two patients were sent to home quarantine. We will take care of such cases in future and it won’t happen again,” he said.He said the nodal officer, a physician, is overburdened with work.“He has to visit all the quarantine centres and has to sit in the district hospital also. The mistake was unintentional,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-suspected-uttarakhand-covid-19-patients-sent-home-before-test-reports/story-QIGzEgovUzyTNDDK8BqDqJ.html

However, a few states are reluctant to take back the migrants,” said a state government official.Maharashtra government is also expected to request for the deployment of central forces in the containment zones in a bid to relieve the stressed state police force.Thackeray, in his address via Facebook Live on Saturday, had said that he might ask for the deployment of additional force from the Centre as many state police personnel have taken ill due to Covid-19-related stress. “We’ll ask for deployment of an additional security force from the Centre, if required,” the CM had said.PM Modi is expected to discuss the extension of lockdown and also an alternative exit plan by opening up economic activities across the country, which have been suspended since March 25 to contain the Covid-19 outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-s-virtual-meet-maha-cm-likely-to-discuss-extension-of-lockdown-and-trains-for-migrants/story-WtR2lbd5sANnr5oYv17jVP.html

This is the first time in history that the dates for the opening of portals of the shrines have been changed.“Only the chief priest or I have the authority of touching the idols and performing the prayers and the prayers of Badrinath shrine are performed following South Indian rituals as the chief priest comes from Kerala,” Shah had said while announcing the change of date.“We did not want someone else from northern India to perform the prayers as the rituals are not the same, which was another reason for changing the dates. With the new dates, the chief priest would have completed the quarantine period,” he said. One of the most visited pilgrimage centres of India, Badrinath is one of the Char Dhams or the four main pilgrimage centres of the Hindus located in Garhwal hills. The Badrinath Temple is along the banks of the Alaknanda River in Chamoli district at a height of over 10,000 feet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/badrinath-s-chief-priest-tests-negative-for-covid-19-twice-reaches-joshimath-ahead-of-portal-opening/story-yPzwCyD7xRNzVmSBGeTqVM.html

The carcass, with its skin intact, was found in the Bagori range of the park.Forest officials and veterinarians conducted the post-mortem examination of the tigress, which had died six to seven days ago, in the afternoon.This is the second tiger death reported in the park this year.Last month, the carcass of an adult tiger was found near Mihibeel in the Kohora range of the park. Old age and infighting was the cause of death.On Saturday, forest officials had found the carcass of an adult male rhino in Agaratoli range of the park with its horn missing.Recovery of empty AK47 cartridges at the spot led forest officials to surmise that the poaching could have been done by some insurgent group in the state.Kaziranga, which is the largest habitat of one-horned rhinos, is home to a total of 121 Royal Bengal Tigers.Though it is peak tourist season, all national parks, wildlife sanctuaries and zoos in Assam have been closed since March 16 as a precautionary measure against the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/carcass-of-tigress-found-in-assam-s-kaziranga-death-likely-due-to-infighting/story-MkjqKBzuHecXkBxHX50cNJ.html

Lodged in the Wandsworth jail since arrest in March 2019, he has been refused bail five times.The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), which represents India in UK courts, said Modi is likely to take part in the extradition trial by video-link. Charges against Modi involve a Mumbai branch of the Punjab National Bank (PNB) that extended his companies loans worth over Rs 11,300 crore.Modi is the subject of two sets of criminal proceedings. The CBI case relates to large-scale fraud upon PNB, through the fraudulent obtaining of Letters of Understanding (LOUs/loan agreements); the ED case relates to the laundering of the proceeds of that fraud.The second extradition request was made on the basis of two additional offences as part of the CBI case. It was certified by home secretary Priti Patel on February 20 as required under the 1993 India-UK extradition treaty.The additional offences relate to allegations that Modi interfered with the CBI investigation by “causing disappearance of evidence” and intimidating witnesses (”criminal intimidation to cause death”). They have not been joined to the CBI case, but will be dealt with at a separate later hearing likely in July, the CPS said.Despite offering to raise the bail security amount to 4 million pounds, UK courts have refused Modi bail on the ground that he posed a flight risk and had the means to influence witnesses and tamper with evidence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nirav-modi-s-5-day-extradition-trial-set-to-begin-in-london-court/story-m7AKas4ujL3Fsx9akCrAeL.html

After three of the inmates tested positive on Saturday evening, the migrants demanded to undertake Covid-19 test. Sources said some of them even tried to escape from the vicinity, but officials foiled their attempt using mild force.A senior officer from Musahari block, requesting anonymity said, “A few inmates tried to create ruckus demanding proper food, facilities of safe drinking water and mosquito nets among other facilities.”“We have informed our superiors at the district headquarter about the incident but have not got any response from them,” he added.Meanwhile, every effort to contact district magistrate Chandrashekhar Singh went in vein.The sub-divisional officer of east sub-division of Muzaffarpur Kundan Kumar feigned ignorance about any such incident. “I have neither been informed by any officer from Musahari block nor the local police officials. So, I am not aware of it,” he said, adding, that at least 107 migrants, from different parts of the country, have been kept there.“They are being provided proper food, including two meals a day and breakfast. Even other facilities are being made available to them. If any shortfall will be come to our notice, we will get it redressed at the earliest,” said the SDO (east).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/isolated-migrants-go-on-rampage-at-covid-19-quarantine-centre-in-bihar-s-muzaffarpur/story-cIJSg5V92dw0lScdwJNbdP.html

Almost two weeks ago, Roy Barman wrote to the chief minister about alleged embezzlement of government funds estimated to be around Rs 39.28 lakh to procure kits to prevent spreading of coronavirus.The state received about 9,000 PPE kits of different categories. Of these, only 914 PPE kits supplied by HIL were found to be appropriate while the rest were found to be permeable to liquid, as alleged by Roy Barman. He also alleged that the goggles procured by the state was not so much protective for eyes and a 500 ml hand sanitiser bottles ‘VENTIZ CLEAR ALL’ were found to have only 57.68 per cent alcohol, that is much less than the required. “....these substandard PPE kits & component articles of PPEs, the frontline soldiers are bound to be vulnerable to the Virus & requested him to purchase kits conforming to the standards laid by Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. I would also request you to blacklist those companies/ traders who have provided such substandard materials,” his letter read.He also alleged of improper disbursement of the funds allocated by the state government for the Tripura people stranded in other parts of the country.“ ....there are a huge number of stranded persons in actual who have not received single farthing assistance to date in spite of fulfilling all formalities. It is a matter of concern that it is not clear as to what mechanism has been adopted by the State Government to ascertain the genuineness of the claims made & reimbursement made to that effect,” said Roy Barman in the letter. The state government on May 5 launched a WhatsApp number where the people could lodge their complaints regarding any corruption.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-tripura-lawmaker-requests-cm-to-blacklist-companies-selling-substandard-ppe/story-wccnLlACG0zgpTC5Zr2NkO.html

Meanwhile, more than 1.87 lakh more people have registered to come back to the state.Chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat on Saturday during a Facebook live session with an organisation said that the government is expecting around 2.25 lakh people to return to the state from different parts of the country, out of which it is being anticipated that 25,000 people could be infected.“We are making all preparations with regard to boosting our health infrastructure and installing intensive care units and ventilators at government hospitals in all the districts. We are expecting that around 2-2.25 lakh people will be returning to the state and it is being anticipated that around 25,000 of them could be infected. Out of these 25,000, there might be a need to hospitalise around 5000 people of which 500 might need ventilators,” said Rawat.“Thus looking at the extreme possible scenario, we are preparing to deal with the situation and boosting our infrastructure accordingly. We cannot leave our people on the roads,” added the chief minister.One person, who returned to the hilly district of Uttarkashi on May 7 from Surat in Gujarat, tested positive on Sunday. This is the first case in the green zone district of Uttarkashi. With this, total of 68 positive cases have been reported from Uttarakhand so far, with 21 active cases and 46 recovered.On May 7, four people reached Chinyalisaur in Uttarkashi district from Surat on two bikes when one of them a 32-year-old man was isolated at the district hospital after he showed symptoms and three others were quarantined at a health facility. The man who was isolated in the hospital tested positive on Sunday.Dr DP Joshi, chief medical officer of Uttarkashi said that the other three youths have also been isolated and their samples have been sent for testing.“The man who tested positive on Sunday came in contact with his brother, therefore he has also been isolated. As a precautionary measure we have stopped movement of vehicles in the district hospital,” said Dr Joshi.On Saturday, four persons including those who returned from Gujarat, Haryana and Mumbai to Udham Singh Nagar district had tested positive. All these people returned using their travel arrangements and not the government arranged transport. Officials said that some persons had used multiple modes of transport making the process of contact tracing difficult.Speaking on the challenges in front of the government with people returning in private vehicles, Madan Kaushik, cabinet minister and official spokesperson for the Uttarakhand government said that the government is finding it difficult to manage those who are returning to the state using private vehicles.So far, the state government has received around 15,000 registrations for those wanting to return in private vehicles.“People returning to the state in their private vehicles are not always following all the norms of home quarantine. We have learnt that they are first staying at their relatives’ places in the plains for a few days before going to their village and there also not following home quarantine strictly. I appeal to them to strictly follow all norms for their own and families’ safety,” said Kaushik.When asked about what is the strategy of the the state government now, Nitesh Jha, secretary for health in the state said, “With hundreds of people returning to the state every day and positive cases being reported from hilly districts like Uttarkashi, the only strategy of the state government is to test, isolate and treat.”Abhishek Tripathi, chief operational officer for Covid-19 in the state said that checking at border points of the state is being intensified now.“The person who tested positive from Uttarkashi on Sunday, was stopped at the district border itself along with those he was travelling with and was immediately quarantined at the district hospital. We cannot ensure institutional quarantine for everybody and that is why home quarantine is a must, where they are being monitored regularly by ASHA and aaganwadi workers,” said Tripathi.Uttarakhand has so far tested 9,668 samples with maximum tests being conducted in Dehradun, Haridwar, Nainital and Udham Singh Nagar districts.As per the health bulletin released by the state government on Sunday, out of total samples tested only 0.75% samples have tested positive in Uttarakhand. The percentage recovery for COVID-19 patient in the state stands at 67.65%, with 46 out of 68 cases having successfully recovered.(with inputs from Vipin Negi in Uttarkashi)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-25-lakh-people-want-to-return-to-uttarakhand-govt-fears-25-000-could-be-covid-19-positive/story-G9nLBp7nrxbOqxuYQEFzjP.html

And Prime Minister Narendra Modi saluted all those who are leveraging technology to bring a positive difference in the lives of others.“On National Technology Day, our nation salutes all those who are leveraging technology to bring a positive difference in the lives of others. We remember the exceptional achievement of our scientists on this day in 1998. It was a landmark moment in India’s history,” PM Modi said on Twitter referring to India’s nuclear test in Rajasthan’s Pokhran. On National Technology Day, our nation salutes all those who are leveraging technology to bring a positive difference in the lives of others.

It was a landmark moment in India’s history.“The tests in Pokhran in 1998 also showed the difference a strong political leadership can make,” he said in another tweet. The tests in Pokhran in 1998 also showed the difference a strong political leadership can make. Here is what I had said about Pokhran, India’s scientists and Atal Ji’s remarkable leadership during one of the #MannKiBaat programmes. pic.twitter.com/UuJR1tLtrLThe day has a historical perspective as it was on May 11, 1998, that India achieved a major technological breakthrough by successfully carrying out nuclear tests at Pokhran when Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the Prime Minister.The underground tests marked the country’s arrival on the world’s nuclear stage and set the scene for some impressive developments in its strategic programme.The first three detonations took place simultaneously at 3.45pm on May 11. These included a 45 kT thermonuclear device, a 15kt fission device and a 0.2 kt sub-kiloton (which is less than a kiloton) device. The two nuclear devices detonated simultaneously on May 13 were also in the sub-kiloton range, 0.5 kT and 0.3 kT.The test happened months after then foreign secretary K Raghunath told his US counterpart that India did not have any intention of testing a nuclear device.The test opened floodgates of trouble for India: Sanctions, economic and military, and interactional isolation. What followed were discussions between Strobe Talbot, then US secretary of state, and then foreign minister Jaswant Singh - they were held in seven countries, 10 cities, and included 14 rounds of talks.For Americans and the west, India was gatecrashing the nuclear club. With Pakistan seeking nuclear parity, the Americans feared South Asia would become a nuclear flashpoint. A great deal of the Talbot-Singh conversation covered this ground.The immediate challenge was to mitigate international opposition and eventually bridge the trust gap with the US.But over the years, India successfully managed everything and its nuclear programme matured significantly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-national-technology-day-pm-modi-remembers-pokhran-test-hails-vajpayee-s-leadership/story-EOUvMWoQh4PwIlV78GWfsI.html

11-05-2020||India||Freshers stare at an uncertain future as Covid hits job market||In the midst of lay-offs, a possible economic contraction and shrinking job opportunities, a sense of fear and uncertainty is palpable among the Class of 2020, who will enter a world changed by the Covid-19 crisis to look for their first jobs. According to the All India Survey on Higher Education 2018-19, over 23 million students are enrolled in undergraduate-level programmes across universities and colleges. A section of these students, pursuing their last year of the programme, will graduate in August as per University Grants Commission guidelines for central universities, while states are still determining their own exam schedules.The students now fear that the job market will dry up as companies pause hiring to recoup the losses that piled up as the economy ground to a halt in an attempt to check the disease spread. “We were lucky our placements happened in February,” said Indranil Palit, a third-year computer science student, who has offers from two top-tier companies. “We’ve signed a letter of intent but there is no news regarding offer letters. We were scheduled to join August. We fear they may rescind the offer.”Third-year marketing student Sneha Roy, however, changed her plans to focus on a Masters instead. “It makes no sense to go for a job at present. The pay scale in the commerce sector has been on a decline in any case,” said Roy, a student at St. Xavier’s University, Kolkata. “Many of my friends and I will be focusing on a Masters programme since the offers we have received are not what we expected.” Industry experts say the situation is set to take a particularly dire turn, as the economy will open slowly and at rock bottom. “We have to realise that the job market was in extremely poor shape even before we entered the Covid-19 crisis,” said human development economist Santosh Mehrotra, who has recently authored Reviving Jobs: An Agenda for Growth. “In 2018, unemployment was at a forty-five year high, it will only get worse, since we are likely to see an economic contraction, that is, the growth rate will fall below zero.” According to Mehrotra, in 2018, the unemployment rate for secondary educated people was 14.4%, for those with technical degrees it was 37% and 36% for graduates. “These rates are double those found in 2012,” he said. “In 2018, we had nearly 30 million people who were unemployed,” said Mehrotra. “I expect the number to rise by another 50 million this year.”“Unemployment will at least double for new entrants this year, it will be catastrophic,” he added. Manish Sabharwal, chairman and co-founder of Teamlease Services, one of India’s largest staffing and human capital firm concurred with Mehrotra that the job sector may see a decline but reserved his judgment until the lockdown is lifted. “It will depend from industry to industry,” said Sabharwal. “We will have to see if the recovery is in a V-shaped, U-shaped or a bathtub curve, bathtub being that the particular sector spends a long time at the bottom.” Sabharwal added that the sunrise would be a ‘gentle one’, as companies will be biased towards retaining present employees and not hiring new ones at the moment. “We are definitely going to see salary adjustments and job losses,” said Sabharwal. “Hospitality, retail and airlines will take a hit. But the impact will be distributed across the board.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/freshers-stare-at-an-uncertain-future-as-covid-hits-job-market/story-0apRwwJJKrZV37LAtUfS8I.html

11-05-2020||India||New guidelines for recording Covid-19 deaths released||The deaths of those with negative or inconclusive test results but with symptoms of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) will be recorded as probable Covid-19 deaths, the Indian Council of Medical Research said in fresh guidelines on recording Covid-19 deaths released on Sunday.The 11-page document states that Covid-19 is known to cause pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, cardiac injury, and clotting throughout the bloodstream, which may lead to death but Covid-19 would be recorded as the underlying cause of death. It adds that co-morbid conditions, like asthama, heart disease, diabetes or cancer, of a patient will not be recorded as the underlying cause of death. It adds that in a person with multiple co-morbidities, only those that could have contributed to the death should be mentioned on the death certificate.“Patterns of disease and patterns of death can come from only standardised recording of clinical disease history and cause of death, and therefore epidemiological surveillance of disease and death are important. Robust data is needed from every district,” the document stated.A draft of guidelines for performing autopsy, packing the dead body of a suspected or confirmed Covid-19 patient, transporting it, and storing it in mortuary was also released on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-guidelines-for-recording-covid-19-deaths-released/story-toSoYKWo6TBYLxYoEZf74M.html
11-05-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||Prime Minister Narendra Modi is meeting chief ministers of states for the fifth time in 51 days on Monday.There’s exactly a week to May 17, a date that can be called either the end of the first phase of India’s graded exit from the lockdown, or the extension of the second phase of the lockdown but with the easing of some restrictions.It’s important to understand the context in which the meeting is happening.The number of cases in India rose to 67,085 on Sunday night, the number of deaths to 2,140, and the number of recoveries to 20,901. Recoveries crossed 20,000 on Sunday, the kind of number that needs celebration. The world over, according to worldometers.info, 98% of the currently active 2.4 million cases are mild, and only 47,565 are “serious or critical”. Anecdotal evidence from India suggests that the situation here is no different.States with a science-based approach to dealing with Covid-19, and with reasonably good public health systems, seem to be getting the better of the disease — Kerala, with three deaths out of 505 cases may be an outlier, but even Tamil Nadu, where administrative bungling (the chief minister announced an unnecessary hard lockdown, with everything being shut, forcing thousands of people out on to the streets, trying to stock up on essentials) resulted in a spike in cases, has done well. The state saw 6,535 cases till Saturday — 526 of these were discovered on Saturday alone — but has recorded only 44 deaths thus far. Maharashtra (22,171 cases; 832 deaths, till Sunday), Gujarat (8,195 and 493) and Madhya Pradesh (3,614 and 215) are the outliers on the other extreme. Together, the three states account for 50.6% of all cases and nearly 72% of all deaths. And Madhya Pradesh, for a state that has been hit hard by the virus, is definitely not testing enough (both Gujarat and Maharashtra are testing twice the number of people per million as Madhya Pradesh is).In the week between May 3 and May 10, the number of Covid-19 cases in India has increased from 42,527 to 67,085, and the number of deaths from 1,393 to 2,140. The number of daily cases was more than 3,000 for four consecutive days since May 6 and exceeded 4,000 for the first time on Sunday. In the last five days (including Sunday), the number of daily deaths have exceeded 100 on all but two days. Yet, as this column has pointed out, most of cases are from a few states. On Saturday, for instance, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Gujarat accounted for two-thirds of all new cases. On Sunday, this proportion was 69%. Vast parts of the country continue to have only a few cases of Covid-19; many are completely free of the disease (or haven’t recorded any cases).It is evident that the lockdown has not helped India flatten the curve, although there is no doubt that the number of deaths and infections would have been higher without one.At least quantitatively, if not qualitatively, India has used this period to strengthen its health care system, and specifically prepare to deal with all aspects of Covid-19 — from testing to treatment. For instance, India is now well on its way to producing locally many RT-PCR tests, the best way of testing for the coronavirus disease.Going by the current trend of daily cases, it is also evident that the number of cases and deaths in India will continue to rise. And collateral damage of the lockdown on the economy, on industrial activity, on businesses, big and small, and on workers of all hues, is significant.The Prime Minister and the chief ministers must discuss ways to restart more economic and other activities even as they work towards finalising restrictions and protocols for disease hot spots that have a high concentration of cases and the most vulnerable population (people over the age of 70).India needs to learn to live with Covid-19 for now but it needs to find a way that protects both lives and livelihoods.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-xaVxvPpm0bB4ZXoyvyUdZO.html

A ghost is on the prowl in a village in Odisha. Apparently hired by the gram panchayat, the sari-clad woman with chalk-white skin roams around at night to ensure that people follow the lockdown. As excepted, her payal goes chhan chhan when she walks. Villagers scream and retreat as soon as they see her.“This does seem like a scene from a comedy horror film!

11-05-2020||India||Trains to restart tomorrow, bookings open online today||The Indian Railways will resume passenger services gradually with trains to 15 destinations from May 12, the government announced on Sunday, green-lighting the operations close to two months after it stopped them as part of a strategy to slow the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).Bookings for these trains — all originating from the New Delhi Railway Station — will begin at 4pm on Monday only on the website of the Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) while ticket counters will continue to remain closed, according to the railways ministry order on the gradual resumption of passenger services.A government functionary who did not want to be named said similar plans are in the works for the aviation sector but he did not elaborate on them.Sunday’s order is seen as another big step towards normalcy with the government already providing area-specific relaxations to private employers, businesses and small shops that are gasping for survival due to the economic fallout of the Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdown prompted by it.“Railways plans to gradually restart passenger train operations from 12th May, 2020, initially with 15 pairs of special trains [30 trips] connecting New Delhi with major stations across India. Booking in these trains will start at 4 pm on 11th May,” railways minister Piyush Goyal tweeted.These trains will run to Dibrugarh (Assam), Agartala (Tripura), Howrah (West Bengal), Patna (Bihar), Bilaspur (Chhattisgarh), Ranchi (Jharkhand), Bhubaneswar (Odisha), Secunderabad (Telangana), Bengaluru (Karnataka), Chennai (Tamil Nadu), Thiruvananthapuram (Kerala), Madgaon (Goa), Mumbai Central (Maharashtra), Ahmedabad (Gujarat) and Jammu Tawi (Jammu and Kashmir).Face masks are a must for passengers boarding these trains, which will only have air-conditioned (AC) coaches and charge fares equivalent to that in premium Rajdhani trains, according to a railway ministry official who did not want to be named. People will be screened at the station and those not showing symptoms of the Covid-19 disease will be allowed to travel.The railways ministry said no counter tickets, including platform tickets, will be issued to passengers. “Only passengers with valid confirmed tickets will be allowed to enter the railway stations,” the ministry official said. Passengers could be asked to reach the station with time in hand for smooth security clearance. Passenger flight and rail services as well as operations of metro trains have been suspended since March 22, three days before the first phase of a national lockdown was imposed in the country of 1.3 billion people. Cargo and special services for the army have continued during the lockdown though. The railways will resume more special services on other routes based on the availability of coaches after reserving 20,000 coaches for Covid-19 care centres and to “enable operation of up to 300 trains everyday as Shramik Special for stranded migrants”, according to the ministry. While the Centre has drafted a plan to deploy railway coaches as isolation wards, or Covid-19 care centres, it has also said it is ready to operate 300 trains — each carrying up to 1,200 passengers — a day to ferry stranded migrant workers to their hometowns. The government flagged off these special trains, or Shramik Specials, on May 1 after requests by states. These will continue to run simultaneously with the passenger trains.The rail network of India would run nearly 14,000 passenger trains and ferry 23 million passengers a day before the lockdown. “Further details including train schedule will be issued separately in due course,” the ministry official said. The schedule for these is expected to be shared on Monday.It was not immediately clear if people above 65 years will be allowed to board these trains. The federal guidelines dictating the terms of the third phase of India’s lockdown advise elderly people not to venture out.According to the ministry official quoted above, these special trains will have AC 1, AC 2 and AC 3 classes, and will run with near-full capacity. The trains will also have stoppages at major routes, he said.The passengers travelling in these trains may not be given blankets and linen, the official said. “These precautions will have to be taken, just as we had in the initial phase of suspending services before the lockdown. We will also have special norms for air conditioning inside the coaches. Temperatures will be kept slightly higher and we will ensure maximum supply of only fresh air,” the official said.The rationale behind the resumption of passenger trains in the third phase of the lockdown is to allow stranded people to return home. “This is also for those who need to get back to work and have been stuck since the lockdown. Our priority is to allow their movement and gradually more trains will begin after that regularly,” the official added. A regular AC 2 coach has sleeping berths across eight bays. Berths are usually arranged in two tiers — four across the width of the coach and two berths on the other side of the corridor with curtains along the gangway. An AC 3 coach consists of 72 seats. “In third AC, some social distancing may be done in berth allotment,” the official added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trains-to-restart-tomorrow-bookings-open-online-today/story-eK3UlLB7OG0vdBZ99YPCXK.html
11-05-2020||India||Covid-19 may have originated from recombined bat, pangolin coronaviruses||A new study has suggested that the Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, might have originated from a recombination of coronaviruses in a bat and pangolin. The findings strengthen the theory that pangolins could be the intermediate host for transmission of Sars-CoV-2 to humans.The paper, published in the journal Nature by researchers from College of Veterinary Medicine, South China Agricultural University, also flags that pangolins, being the most trafficked mammal in the world, could be a future threat to public health if wildlife trade is not controlled because they harbour Sars-CoV-2-like viruses.A coronavirus isolated from Malayan pangolins by a team of Chinese scientists showed 100%, 98.6%, 97.8% and 90.7% amino acid identity with Sars-CoV-2 in 4 genes. The Malayan pangolin coronavirus was found to be particularly identical to Sars-CoV-2 in its receptor binding domain of the spike protein (which SARS-CoV-2 uses to bind to its host’s cells).Genome sequencing found that the pangolin-CoV was very similar to both SARS-CoV-2 and Bat Sars-CoV RaTG13 (from which SARS-CoV-2 is suspected to have originated) but the only difference was the spike or S gene.Further analysis of S gene sequences has suggested recombination events on May 8. For this study, the team used lung tissues from four Chinese pangolins and 25 Malayan pangolins in a wildlife rescue center during March-August 2019. RNA from 17 of the 25 Malayan pangolins were found to be positive for Sars-CoV-2 like viruses and they gradually showed signs of respiratory disease, including shortness of breath, emaciation, inactivity, and crying. Out of 17, 14 pangolins later died. Generally, a natural reservoir host does not show severe disease, while an intermediate host may have clinical signs of infection, the authors said.Pangolins and bats are both nocturnal animals, eat insects, and share overlapping ecological niches which make pangolins the ideal intermediate host for some Sars-related coronaviruses. The paper recommended more systematic and long-term monitoring of coronaviruses in pangolins and a complete ban on illegal pangolin trade, international cooperation and strict regulation against consumption of game meat and wildlife trade.“Of particular interest here is that the entire genome of the pangolin coronavirus is not similar to the Sars-CoV-2 but they’re almost identical in the receptor-binding area (which the virus uses to bind to its host’s cells). Interestingly, the genome of Sars-CoV-2 is 96% similar to the bat coronavirus RaTG13 (found in the intermediate horseshoe bat) but differs in the receptor-binding site (which means that the RaTG13 cannot directly infect human lungs because its receptor cannot bind to human lung cells). Put these two pieces of information together and you arrive at the hypothesis that has the most amount of support so far,” said Rohit Chakravarty, wildlife biologist and PhD student at the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research in Berlin, Germany who read the paper.“Which is, a bat coronavirus jumped from a bat to a Malayan pangolin (either in the wild or in captivity), the virus recombined in the pangolin and incorporated the pangolin coronavirus’s receptor-binding region, and then it evolved into Sars-CoV-2 that causes Covid-19 in humans,” he added.Pangolins are trafficked because it is believed that their scales and blood have medicinal properties, and their flesh is considered a delicacy in some parts of southeast Asia. “As many reports have shown, pangolins are now the most trafficked wild animal species in the world. As with all wildlife trade, the answer to how it can be controlled is quite complicated, because the flow chain goes through several layers of society. Ultimately, we are all culpable because the scale of operations is directly correlated to wealth in consumer countries. It is very easy to say that the eating habits of the Chinese are responsible for all the current problems we face. However, it is much harder for us to acknowledge, that actually the consumerist lifestyles of all developed and developing economies is actually the engine that’s driving this thriving trade,” said Abi Tamim Vanak, Fellow, Wellcome Trust/DBT India Alliance Program and senior fellow at Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-may-have-originated-from-recombined-bat-pangolin-coronaviruses/story-tWiWuhucSv2UtMM3mDNFPN.html
11-05-2020||India||India sees biggest jump in new coronavirus cases but recoveries hit 20,000||The number of people who have so far recovered after contracting the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in the country crossed 20,000 on Sunday, with a recuperating rate of 31.2%, or about one in every three patients, even as the number of infections of Sars-CoV-2 crossed 67,000.Studies have shown that after recovery — globally, 35% of the total patients have so far recovered — nearly all people develop antibodies, which could give them protection against the infection. Public health experts have warned against the stigmatisation of Covid-19 patients, even as research shows that about 80% of all patients across the world develop mild or no symptoms.Of the 67,085 Covid-19 cases, at least 44,000 patients are undergoing treatment at various hospitals across the country. In the last 24 hours, 1,736 people were confirmed as recovered — the biggest jump so far — even as 4,370 fresh infections were added to the national tally, the highest single-day spike. The recovery rate on April 10 was 10.3%, improving to 31.2% in a month.“The recovery rate shows that almost one-third of the infected persons have recovered in India. It is a positive sign as it is increasing by the day,” Lav Agarwal, joint secretary, Union health ministry, said recently.The rate of increase of Covid-19 cases in the country has, however, increased over the past week, with the doubling rate, which stood at 11.5 on May 3, reducing to 10.6 on Sunday. The last 10,000 cases of the infection, which has halted life across continents, came in just three days in India.The ratio of the number of Covid-19 cases recovering in relation to the number of people dying of the viral infection has shown improvement. Data collected from official bulletins from states shows the ratio to be 9:1 – for every 10 deaths, 90 people have recovered from the disease. In mid-April, the ratio was 8:2.“The increase in the recovery rate will go hand in glove with the increase in the number of cases for a while. That is because Covid-19 is a novel infection and it will spread till the population gets immunity against the virus. Now, as for how many people will get infected before there is herd immunity, the estimates vary from anywhere between 30% of the population to 70%. The reason for a high recovery rate is that 90% to 95% of the infections are either mild to moderately symptomatic or asymptomatic,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at the Safdarjung Hospital.“What the high recovery rate shows is that the infection is not highly fatal in the Indian population; we are capable of managing the infection, and the treatment protocols are working,” he added.Experts say implementing a complete national lockdown has yielded results in the form of significant improvement in India’s case doubling rate. While the number stood at 3.4 days before the restrictions kicked in, it went up to 11.5 on May 3. It, however, has come down to 10.6, indicating a quickening of infections. On average, India has reported about 3,500 new cases every day over the last week.Of the states that have reported more than 1,000 cases, the highest recovery rate is in Telangana, where 62.8% of the patients are now Covid-19-free. This is followed by Rajasthan, where over 58% of those who were infected have recovered, and Andhra Pradesh, where almost 46.7% have recovered.Kerala’s battle against the respiratory illness has shown promise. Only 20 people of the total 512 cases so far are currently designated as active infections. The state has reported only three deaths so far. Maharashtra, which has the highest number of cases, 22,171, has one of the lowest recovery rates of 18.9% in the country.Tamil Nadu and Delhi have managed to keep the number of deaths low despite a surge in cases initially linked to the Nizamuddin gathering of the Tablighi Jamaat. Delhi’s recovery rate of 29.9% is similar to the national figure.On Sunday, Delhi recorded 381 new cases, taking the total tally to 6,923.A third of Rajasthan’s 33 districts now have either no or up to two active cases. According to the state health department’s data, two districts have zero active cases, five have one each, and two have two active cases each. Two districts – Bundi and Sriganganagar – have not reported any case since the outbreak in Rajasthan in the last week of March.Urban hot spots across the country remain the biggest challenge in India’s battle against the disease, which had overwhelmed health care infrastructure across countries, including many metropolises even across the developed world.Maharashtra, Delhi and Gujarat are the three worst affected states by the disease. On Sunday, Maharashtra reported 1,943 cases, while the national capital added 381 cases. In Gujarat, which has requested All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) director Dr Randeep Guleria to fly to the state to assist in disease management, 398 people were infected by the pathogen on Sunday.The number of tests performed to detect patients of the new disease was 1.6 million on Sunday, as the government indicated that it intended to scale up its testing capacity to 100,000 diagnoses per day. The development came after experts expressed concern over low testing numbers and limited scope, which they said could lead to the disease spreading undetected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/biggest-jump-in-new-cases-but-recoveries-hit-20-000/story-7xmlrtODGwlXjrh9UXxzKP.html
11-05-2020||India||ICMR develops test kit to detect Covid antibodies||The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has developed ‘Covid Kavach ELISA’, a test kit for detection of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) antibodies, Union health minister Harsh Vardhan announced on Sunday.The ICMR’s apex virology laboratory- National Institute of Virology-Pune (NIV) has both developed and validated the test to detect IgG antibody. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) is the most common antibody in blood and other body fluids that immune system makes to protects against bacterial and viral infections and allergens. However, IgG can take time to form after an infection, and can be useful in detecting a past infection. “…there is an augmented demand of various types of diagnostic tests by countries all across the globe. Most of the diagnostic material for Covid-19 is imported into India from other countries. Therefore, Indian scientists are tirelessly engaged in developing indigenous diagnostics for Sars-CoV-2, the causative agent of Covid-19…” said Harsh Vardhan in a statement.“NIV’s competent scientific team successfully isolated the Sars-CoV-2 virus from laboratory confirmed patients in India. This in turn has paved the way for development of indigenous diagnostics for Sars-CoV-2,” he added. While real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the frontline test for clinical diagnosis of Sars-CoV-2, robust antibody tests are critical for surveillance to understand the proportion of population exposed to infection, say experts.“We currently have the requisite technology to develop good quality antibody based tests in weeks. These tests are a good tool for surveillance purposes,” said Dr Shobha Broor, former head, department of microbiology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi.The test was validated at two sites in Mumbai and has been found to have high sensitivity and specificity.“…the test will have the advantage of testing 90 samples together in a single run of 2.5 hours. Moreover, ELISA based testing is easily possible even at district level as the ELISA kit has inactivated virus. There are also minimal bio-safety and bio-security requirements as compared to the real-time RT-PCR test. The test has an advantage of having much higher sensitivity and specificity as compared to the several rapid test kits which have recently flooded the Indian market,” said health ministry in a statement.The ICMR has partnered with Zydus Cadila for mass scale production of these test kits. The research body has already transferred the technology for mass scale production to the company.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/icmr-develops-test-kit-to-detect-covid-antibodies/story-QAWGfOwRyVJ2Ac7zt4VwqL.html
11-05-2020||India||Regulator approves first trial of lab-grown antibody drug||The Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) on Sunday approved the first multi-centric trial of Tocilizumab in India after the second-line drug to treat rheumatoid arthritis emerged as a treatment option for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).Tocilizumab won the green light because of its ability to lower aberrant host immune response that leads to an inflammatory cytokine storm -- an overreaction of the immune system -- and death in hospitalised patients.Tocilizumab is a monoclonal antibody that acts against interleukin-6 (IL-6), a chemical that causes inflammation. “The deterioration in the Covid-19 patients’ condition in the majority of cases is due to hyper-immunity, or an excessive response of one’s own immune system. This cytokine storm or Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) is caused by the release of inflammatory chemicals in the body namely IL-6, TNF-alpha and IL1 among others. Tocilizumab is an antibody against IL-6, which is already available, licenced and effective in treating CRS caused by other conditions,” Dr A S Soin, chairman of the Medanta Liver Transplant Institute, Medanta-The Medicity, Gurugram.Dr Soin is the national lead investigator for the randomised control trial for the use of Tocilizumab in Covid-19 in India. The trial will be conducted in several hospitals in Delhi-National Capital Region, Haryana, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Telangana and Tamil Nadu.Monoclonal antibodies are lab-made proteins that act like natural antibodies and that work by identifying and binding to the virus to destroy it. They have been able to block coronavirus infection in labs in the Netherlands and Israel and are emerging as a critical new tool against Covid-19, which has infected 4 million people and killed at least 280,000 since December 219.The antiviral remedesvir is the only drug that has been approved for emergency use to treat Covid-19 by the US Food and Drug Administration. In the absence of a vaccine or drug to treat Covid-19, clinicians are relying on repurposing existing drugs to identify a therapy that is both safe and effective.“The indications are very strong that its use early in the course of Covid-19 infection will mitigate CRS and prevent patients from going into the full blown syndrome and progression to acute respiratory syndrome needing ICU admission and ventilation, multi-organ dysfunction, and death,” said Dr Soin.Inflammatory cytokine storm stops oxygenation by impeding gas exchange in the lungs, leading to death. “Our research has identified that pathogenic T cells and inflammatory monocytes incite inflammatory storm with large amount of interleukin-6, therefore monoclonal antibody that targets the IL-6 pathways may potentially curb inflammatory storm. Tocilizumab treatment that {involves} blocking IL-6 receptors showed inspiring clinical results including temperature {that} returned to normal quickly and respiratory function. Tocilizumab is an effective treatment in severe patients of Covid-19 to calm the inflammatory storm and reduce mortality,” according to a study from China published in the Journal of Translational Medicine on April 14.“Tocilizumab is undergoing clinical trials in many countries, where the treatment protocols include severely ill patients who may be too sick to respond to treatment. In India, the majority of hospitalized patients have moderate illness that doesn’t need ICU or ventilator support, and the idea is to prevent them from progressing to the severe stage,” said Dr Soin.“As soon as we reboot, the infection rates will surge. We eagerly await the results of this trial. If it works, it could save thousands in India and have a real global impact,” said Dr Naresh Trehan, chairman, Medanta-The Medicity which was the first private hospital to admit Covid-19 patients in India.The World Health Organisation has begun multi-country clinical trials to assess the effectiveness of four of the most promising experimental therapies to treat Covid-19. The drugs undergoing trials are antiviral remdesivir, which shuts down viral replication by inhibiting a key viral enzyme; the anti-malaria drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine that work by decreasing the acidity in endosomes; a combination of the antiretrovirals ritonavir and lopinavir that are used to treat HIV; and ritonavir/lopinavir and interferon-beta, which regulates inflammation and is used to treat multiple sclerosis and chronic hepatitis-C infection.Other drugs may be added, based on emerging evidence, said the WHO.“Monoclonal antibodies are an established cancer therapy that is used to treat specific types of cancers, such as cancers of the breast and blood. It’s against Sars-CoV2 is promising but needs extensive and robust human trials to establish whether it stops Covid-19 infection and helps patients recover,” said Dr SVS Deo, head of surgical oncology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/regulator-approves-first-trial-of-lab-grown-antibody-drug/story-83M7NUBUsEoRW3TcuPS9UM.html
11-05-2020||India||State govts on alert as new superspreaders make tracing tough||Ten vegetable and fruit vendors in Jaipur, three in Ahmedabad, a biryani delivery boy in Bhubaneswar and a kirana shop owner in Tuglakabad in Delhi are among new potential superspreaders of the coronavirus disease identified by the authorities in various states.According to officials, the common factor in all these cases was that the source of the virus was not traceable. As most of these people were asymptomatic, their identification was a challenge for the authorities. In most of the cases, they were identified only after a large number of cases were reported from the places they had visited, officials said.These new cases are markedly different from the superspreaders identified earlier. In March and April, most of the Covid-19 superspreaders were people with known travel history to places highly infected with Covid-19. Except the 11 vegetable vendors in Jhajjar, authorities have not been able to track the travel history of any other service provider to a known Covid-19 hotspot.Kerala’s Wayanad remained Covid-19 free for 32 days before a truck driver from Chennai’s Koyambedu vegetable market got the virus. The market, now described as a major node for the infection, contributed to a sudden spurt in Covid-19 cases in Chennai in the last week. “The market is linked to hundreds of cases. We don’t know from where the virus came in the market,” said corporation commissioner G Prakash. This truck driver is said to have spread the virus to 20 other people including his 82-year-old mother, a 49-year-old wife and his co-driver’s 21-year-old son. In Rajasthan, the Jaipur municipal corporation identified 10 fruit and vegetable vendors as superspreaders after they infected at least 150 persons in the city. Jaipur has the highest number of Covid-19 cases in the state at 378.Nineteen superspreaders including vegetable vendors, milk vendors and grocery shop workers, became the carrier for the virus in 30 new localities in Ahmedabad, which accounts for about 70% of the total cases in Gujarat that have crossed 8,000.In Odisha’s Bhubaneswar, a biryani delivery boy was identified as Covid positive. In Lucknow’s Qaiserbagh, eight persons were infected from a vegetable vendor.In Haryana’s Jhajjar, which had no case till April 24, 11 vegetable sellers who visited Delhi’s Azadpur fruit and vegetable market tested positive for the virus days later. Jhajjar civil surgeon Dr Randeep Punia said they came to know these vegetable vendors only when cases started coming up from the places the sellers frequented in the town“Identifying such persons is the biggest challenge,” said Ajitabh Sharma, principal secretary, department of energy and nodal officer for Covid-19 management in Jaipur. “They have no symptoms. And even if they mild symptoms, they tend to hide them fearing loss of work.”These instances of some essential service providers getting infected have pushed the authorities to look at new strategies to check the spread without hampering the supply of goods to localities.In Jaipur, Sharma said all vendors in the city are being tested and their visits have been restricted only to a few localities.“We have colour-coded their carts depending on their municipal ward to restrict their movement. Not more than 10 vendors are being allowed in a locality,” he said.Punia added that in Jhajjar, they have decided to test all those who come in contact with people frequently such as milk booth operators and shop owners. Giving daily health update on Aarogya Setu app has been made mandatory for them.Dr Rajesh Malhotra, head of Covid-19 centre at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Delhi, said the recent emergence of superspreaders show that travel history of a person is no more relevant as most of them don’t have any travel history.“We need to have a strategy to identify such persons quickly and isolate them before they spread the virus to a large number of people,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/state-govts-on-alert-as-new-superspreaders-make-tracing-tough/story-MxdjVfnIBpD6tKJN5PEt0M.html
11-05-2020||India||Rape talk not from boys’ group, sent from fake profile, say cops||There was a twist in the controversy surrounding alleged remarks of sexual assault made by schoolboys in a closed social media chat when the Delhi Police on Sunday said that the conversation which brought the issue to light was never discussed on the “Bois Locker Room” group.In fact, the police said that the conversation — in which a boy was ostensibly instigating his friends to assault a girl from their class — was a separate chat that was instigated by the same girl who was the supposed target of the crime.“The girl had created a fake Snapchat account to test the values and character of her male friend. She wanted to check the boy’s reaction when someone suggested something like that to him, and particularly when someone spoke about her. So she created a fake account in the name of a fictional boy called Siddharth. Using that fake account, she began a one-on-one conversation with him, and suggested the sexual assault idea,” said Anyesh Roy, deputy commissioner of police (cyber crime). “The screenshots of their private conversation were mixed with the objectionable screenshots from the Instagram group ‘Bois Locker Room’,” he added.Screenshots of the objectionable conversation surfaced earlier this month, leading to social media outrage, and prompting the Delhi Police to register a case. An 18-year-old and a minor boy have been held in connection with the “Bois Locker Room” group’s activities, and 24 members of that group, including 16 minors, have so far been identified, examined, and their mobile phones seized for forensic analysis. Many of them study in reputed schools across Delhi-NCR.Roy said that when the police began investigating that conversation, it turned out that the conversation in question and the group were not connected.“On Snapchat, the boy refused to participate in any discussion against the girl, and ended off any further conversation with the fictional Siddharth. He also took screenshots of that chat, reported it to his friends, and to the same girl who had created the fake account. Since the girl knew the truth behind that conversation, she did not report it to anyone,” said the DCP.One other recipient of the screenshots posted it as an Instagram story, which went viral on social media. When the “Bois Locker Room” chats emerged, this Snapchat conversation got mixed with them, Roy said. The police are unlikely to pursue any punitive action against the girl, said another investigator who did not want to be identified. “The girl and boy who were part of this conversation had nothing to do with the Instagram group chat. Both are separate issues,” the investigator said.The police, meanwhile, are continuing to investigate the ‘Bois Locker Room’ episode.“We have received a response from Instagram who we had asked for details of the members of the group. They have shared partial information about three Instagram accounts,” Roy said.On the Instagram group, the members were allegedly discussing about morphing the images and leaking photos of girls known to them. The police have screenshots of the same.Jyoti Duhan Rather, a member of the Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR), said that the incident should be treated with maturity. “The children at this age are vulnerable, be it a boy or a girl. Children of both genders need proper guidance, counselling and supervision of parents, family and teachers. We must be as a reformer for them and they must not be treated as criminals,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rape-talk-not-from-boys-group-sent-from-fake-profile-say-cops/story-8rs6jiCJQAlEHHdrn8TBZJ.html
11-05-2020||India||Indian Army confirms face-off with China in Sikkim||The Indian Army on Sunday confirmed that a heated confrontation took place between Indian and Chinese soldiers in north Sikkim on Saturday, resulting in injuries to troops on both sides. Soldiers from the two countries also clashed in eastern Ladakh last week, a senior officer said, asking not to be named. The army statement came on a day Hindustan Times reported that scores of Indian and Chinese soldiers were involved in a tense face-off at Naku La in Sikkim and the scuffle left 11 soldiers injured.“Incident of face-off as referred to in the (HT) article did take place. Aggressive behaviour by the two sides resulted in minor injuries to troops,” the statement said.The army said “temporary and short duration face-offs” between border guarding troops do occur as boundaries are not resolved. The statement said the two sides disengaged after dialogue and interaction at the local level. “Troops resolve such issues mutually as per established protocols,” the statement added.Four Indian and seven Chinese soldiers were injured during the confrontation that involved about 150 soldiers.Such face-offs do take place along the disputed border but this has possibly happened for the first time at Naku La, said Lieutenant General Vinod Bhatia (retd), a former Director General of Military Operations.“There are rare occasions when the two sides get into heated arguments over their perceived land claims, leading to pushing and shoving. On the positive side, the last shot was fired along the India-China border in October 1975,” said Bhatia, who has commanded the Sukna-based HQs 33 Corps, which is responsible for Sikkim.He said face-offs were on the rise as both sides were patrolling the borders more than before because of better access and improved infrastructure.A scuffle broke out between Indian and Chinese soldiers near Pangong Lake in eastern Ladakh last week (the night of May 5-6) but a flare-up was avoided as both armies stuck to protocols to resolve the stand-off, said the senior officer cited above. He said a few soldiers on both sides suffered minor injuries.The Asian giants have had a long-standing border dispute that led to a war in 1962. The festering feud causes around 400 face-offs every year along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).Indian and Chinese soldiers have been involved in fistfights earlier, too. In August 2017, they threw stones at each other and exchanged blows near Pangong Lake. The clash near the LAC aggravated bilateral tensions as it happened at a time when the two neighbours were locked in a long stand-off in the disputed Doklam plateau close to Sikkim.The 73-day Doklam stand-off between India and China along the Sikkim border was likely to be the new normal, the Centre for Joint Warfare Studies (CENJOWS) said in 2017, making a strong case for building military capabilities “as China respected strength”.In a paper titled Looking Beyond Doklam, the CENJOWS, a think tank set up by the defence ministry, said it was crucial for India to demonstrate strength as peace along the disputed border will be “constantly and continuously” under stress, with “increase in frequency, intensity and depth of (Chinese) transgressions leading to more and more stand-offs.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-confirms-face-off-with-china-in-sikkim/story-0T8pmdTXYDOy5yK5jro1cI.html
11-05-2020||India||Migrant workers battle stigma, bias back home||Migrant workers returning from India’s industrial states are battling stigma and bias in their home villages in some parts of Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand and Odisha because local residents suspect that the labourers are potential carriers of the coronavirus disease, or Covid-19 . The workers say they and their families have been singled out, sneered at, and harassed by villagers. In some villages, they face ostracisation even after completing the mandatory 14-day quarantine period.Last week, a group of villagers armed with sticks in Uttar Pradesh’s Basti district allegedly surrounded Shekhar, a migrant worker who returned from Maharashtra, which is the state worst hit by the pandemic.“The villagers were angry because I had ventured out of the primary school, where I was quarantined, to relieve myself,” Shekhar said. “Okani ke corona ke dar rahal na ta mariye det sa (The villagers were scared of contacting the coronavirus, so they didn’t touch me. Otherwise, I would have been killed that day),” he said, claiming that he had no symptoms of Covid.In some districts, workers alleged caste slurs were hurled at them because they hailed from lower castes. Ravi Maurya, a migrant worker from Prayagraj, who returned by a ‘Shramik Special’ train, said, “Most of the villagers who have returned home belong to the lower castes and therefore, upper caste villagers harass us more,” he said, adding that one day he was abused by the upper caste men when he was standing on roof of the house. “They said that I can spread coronavirus even my standing on the roof of my house.”Dinesh Verma, a migrant worker from Pratapgarh district, said a local grocery shop owner asked his wife not to visit his shop. “I have to request my relatives to help me in procuring things of daily need,” he said.Migrants in Barabanki and Ayodhya complained of similar harassment. Pankaj Yadav, husband of the village head of Mahadewa village in Basti, said, “The fear of coronavirus has become bigger than the virus itself. This is the biggest problem we are facing right now.” There were reports of similar discrimination from Odisha and Jharkhand.On May 7, residents of Sana Aryapalli village in Ganjam district pelted stones at the police in protest against 40 labourers from Surat who were being kept at government school in the village. The police lathi-charged the villagers to disperse them. On May 9, 12 people from Kandhamal district who returned from pilgrimage in Uttarakhand had to be given police protection to enter a local quarantine centre because villagers were protesting against the centre. Local village head Ranjan Kanhar said the villagers agreed to keep the 12 in the quarantine centre for the time being. “We will request the local block development officer to shift them to some other quarantine centre as villagers are apprehensive regarding infection they may be carrying,” he said.Rakhi Singh, an ayurvedic doctor, was not allowed to stay in home quarantine after she returned from Telangana with her three children . Her husband Sudhir Kumar, lodged a complaint with the police after the local village chief refused to allow his wife to quarantine herself at home, saying he had not received any ‘official communication’ in this regard. The doctor had to spend an entire night in a car.In Jharkhand’s West Singbhum district, migrants alleged they were not allowed to enter the villages. “When was taken to a quarantine centre in my village, the locals opposed it saying that I am carrying the virus. They even prevented my family members to meet me. I had no symptoms and I even offered to get myself tested. They did not listen. The police then took me to another quarantine centre,” said 22-year-old Shamu Munda, who was among the first to return from Telangana.Another tribal in Dumka district, who came back from Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh, Surin Soren, said that his family has been socially ostracised since his return. “They (villagers) claim that all of us are carriers of the virus and will infect them all. They have put barricades outside her house with a poster saying our house is infected with corona,” he said over phone .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/migrant-workers-battle-stigma-bias-back-home/story-0uuRSEZfoickVOrPU2agGL.html
11-05-2020||India||Prepared to run 300 trains daily for migrants, says railways minister Piyush Goyal||The Indian Railways is geared up to run 300 trains a day to ferry stranded migrant labourers to their hometowns, railways minister Piyush Goyal said on Sunday, while also appealing to states to ramp up efforts to ensure that the workers reach their destinations across the country in the next three-four days.According to his ministry, the railways ran till Saturday a total of 364 Shramik Special trains. Out f the 90 planned on Saturday, 64 were already in transit till the filing of this report. So far, railways ferried 450,000 passengers.“As per the directions of Hon’ble PM Narendra Modi ji, Railways is fully geared up to run 300 Shramik Special trains every day at short notice since the last six days,” Goyal tweeted.“I appeal to all the States to give permission to evacuate and bring back their stranded migrants so that we can get all of them back to their homes in the next 3-4 days itself,” he said in another tweet.Shramik Special trains, which began on May 1, are bound for a single destination without any stoppages. Usually, they have 24 coaches with each carrying a little over 50 passengers in place of the total capacity of 72, taking the total number of passengers per train to up to 1,200. This means 300 trains a day for the next four days would be able to carry over 1.4 million passengers.The Shramik Special trains are being run only after a concurrence is given by states that are sending the passengers as well as those receiving them, the ministry said. In an earlier guideline, the Centre asked both sides to coordinate for the transit of migrant workers who are stuck across India due to the ongoing lockdown prompted by the coronavirus disease.According to states’ estimates on April 30, around 10 million workers were stranded across the country; many of them struggling after losing their jobs in the wake of the lockdown. Experts, too, pointed out that the number of stranded migrants could be more than the central government’s estimates even though several of them have already reached their homes by special buses and these trains.In the first week of April, a status report submitted by the Centre to the Supreme Court said a little over a million migrant workers and others were housed at 26,476 relief and active shelter camps across the country. Of them, 630,000 were in government camps and the rest in those run by non-government organisations.“The estimates by the railway minister are based on the figure of roughly 600,000 migrants in government relief camps...However, it is estimated that there are roughly 60-65 million interstate migrant workers. Even if we assume that only 50% of them want to travel back, then the number of trains being suggested are not enough,” said Rajendran Narayanan, assistant professor, Azim Premji University.According to the railways ministry, a total of 287 trains have reached their destinations across 11 states — Andhra Pradesh (1 train), Bihar (87 trains), Himachal Pradesh (1 train), Jharkhand (16 trains), Madhya Pradesh (24 trains), Maharashtra (3 trains), Odisha (20 trains), Rajasthan (4 trains), Telangana (2 trains), Uttar Pradesh (127 trains), West Bengal (2 trains). These trains have departed from states such as Gujarat, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, Karnataka, Kerala, Punjab, Rajasthan and Telangana.Uttar Pradesh and Bihar have taken in the maximum number of migrants back with more than 80,000 people each, according the internal railway ministry data. They were followed by Madhya Pradesh and Jharkhand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/prepared-to-run-300-trains-daily-for-migrants-goyal/story-IjBQV32bYaWNDpoNvgOVLN.html
11-05-2020||India||6 migrants die in Madhya Pradesh accident||Six migrant workers were killed and 12 injured when the truck they were travelling in overturned in Madhya Pradesh late on Saturday, police officials familiar with the matter said.According to police, the group of 15 labourers, including 14 from Uttar Pradesh and one from Madhya Pradesh, was travelling to Agra from Telangana’s Hyderabad in a truck carrying raw mangoes when the accident took place in Narsinghpur district, around 240 kilometers from state capital Bhopal. “Five of the labourers were killed on the spot while another died during treatment at a hospital in Jabalpur. All the deceased labourers belonged to Uttar Pradesh. They have been identified as Nihal Singh, 40, Ranvir Lodhi, 42, Nem Singh, 38, Indresh Pandey,40, Chhotu Tiwari,40, and Sandip Dixit, 42” Narsinghpur additional superintendent of police Rajesh Tiwari said. He added that they were trying to ascertain how the accident took place.They were engaged as labourers, mainly at construction sites and factories.Gurukaran Singh, superintendent of police, Narsinghpur, said that they do not have knowledge of any payment made to the driver or owner of the truck. The truck driver or owner was perhaps known to some of these labourers, said Singh.Apart from the migrant workers, the truck’s driver and cleaner were also injured in the accident and undergoing treatment, officials said. Yogesh Kumar, of Hinona in Etah district, said they had been quarantined in Hyderabad. After quarantine, they didn’t have enough money for food, due to which they decided to return home, Kumar said.The officials from district administration said one of the injured labourers showed symptoms of the cold.Dr R Tiwari, superintendent of the teaching hospital of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Medical College, Jabalpur said, “One of the two labourers who were referred to our hospital had symptoms of cold. His sample had been taken in Narsinghpur itself. He was admitted here in an isolation ward but he left the hospital without telling anyone.”Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan termed the incident as unfortunate and said: “The truck accident in Narsinghpur has claimed several precious lives. The untimely deaths and grievous injuries have caused me immense pain. I pray their souls rest in peace and their families get the strength to overcome their grief.”On Friday, 16 migrant workers were run over by a freight train near Maharashtra’s Aurangabad as they slept on train tracks after a long journey on foot in an attempt to find transport to go back to their home towns in Madhya Pradesh. The incident triggered widespread discussions on the need to ensure safe travel for migrants to their home towns amid the nationwide lockdown to check the spread of coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/6-migrants-die-in-mp-accident/story-xomSHsVPpfvakDzmFpN3wO.html
11-05-2020||India||CBSE charts plan to hold remaining exams||The logistics seem daunting. Hundreds of thousands of students appearing for a test, the need to make sure social distancing norms are observed in these days of the coronavirus disease and students and invigilators get safely to the examination centres. The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) thinks it can pull it off. All students and the invigilators will wear face masks and carry hand sanitizers when Class XII board examinations are held from July 1 to 15 for an estimated 1.2 million students . No more than a dozen students will sit in an examination hall. In addition, in north-east Delhi, Class X exams are scheduled for students where because of communal violence in February, some had to be postponed. “It is a challenging task to conduct an exam of such a vast proportions when the country is still facing the pandemic but we feel it is doable because the previous exams in March were also conducted at a time when the onslaught of the disease was being felt and accordingly modifications made. We believe learning from that experience, we will be able to put a detailed safety mechanism in place,” said an official who didn’t want to be named.The maximum number of candidates who will be appearing for a test on a single day will not exceed 400,000 he said. And in March, the CBSE conducted exams where up to 1.95 million lakh sat for a test on a single day.“Even in that test we tried to ensure there are not more than 12 students in one room. Therefore, it will not be difficult to ensure there are not more than 12 students in one room to take care of the social distancing aspect,” said a second official.The maximum number of students -- at least 350,000 -- will appear for the business studies exam for class 12. The Hindi exam will see around 300,000 candidates taking the test, Geography has over 100,000, home science around 60,000 and sociology some 50,000 candidates.“There is still time and we will accordingly plan and bring suitable norms. However, there will be proper social distancing and precautions when the exams are conducted,” said the second official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbse-charts-plan-to-hold-remaining-exams/story-31nwR5mMv2oucjwyohxYjI.html
11-05-2020||India||Central teams chart Covid plan with states, flag gaps||The Centre has sent at least 50 health and disaster response teams to various states since March when cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) started rising to assist state governments in managing cases and containing the spread of infection.The latest batch of experts has been rushed to 10 states from where maximum cases currently are being reported: Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.The team in Andhra Pradesh from the All India Institute of Hygiene and Public Health (AIIHM & PH) visited Kurnool town, and expressed concern over the growing number of cases.Kurnool accounts for maximum number of 566 of the 1,980 cases and 16 of the 45 deaths reported in the state so far.The team members, Dr Madhumita Dubey and Dr Sanjay Sadhukhan, held a meeting with senior officials of the district to review the situation in the state in general, and Kurnool in particular.Dubey said the state government should come out with new appropriate strategies to contain the fast spreading virus in tune with the growing number of cases. She suggested that testing, tracing, isolation and quarantine should be done faster and if necessary, the government should take the help of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) for contact tracing.She advised the government to enhance the capacity of human resources, quarantine centres, Covid-19 care centres and hospitals to face the challenges effectively in case there was a large-scale outbreak of the virus in the coming days.So far, the state government has conducted 173,735 tests, including 8666 tests in the last 24 hours alone.Dubey said the central team had come to Kurnool to extend handholding to the state and the district administration in preventing spreading of the Covid-19 further. “After examining the situation in all aspects, we shall make appropriate recommendations to the state government,” she said.Prof Sadhukhan said since it was not possible for the government to continue lockdown for an indefinite period, the government should mentally prepare the people to live with Coronavirus after the lifting of the lockdown. “We need to educate the people on how to maintain self-restraint to prevent the spread of the virus,” he said.District collector G Veerapandian explained the efforts being made by the Kurnool district administration in containing the virus and bring down the death rate. He said though the number of cases was going up in the district, the recovery was also equally faster.The director of All India Institute of Medical (AIIMS), Dr Randeep Guleria, led a two-member team that visited Gujarat to assess the situation in the state that has reported over 7,000 cases and has a death rate of around 6%, which is nearly double of country’s death rate of about 3.3%.The AIIMS, Delhi, chief, has attributed high mortality rate to underlying medical conditions in most of the admitted patients and also delay in seeking treatment. “Late reporting to hospital due to stigma seems to be one cause and comorbidities in patients for high mortality rate in Gujarat,” said Dr Guleria.Earlier, another set of 20 central teams were sent to 20 high disease burden districts on May 3.“The main objective of sending the teams of experts is to assess the situation on ground and advise the state government accordingly on how best to implement containment measures and manage cases so that they do not turn critical. Their job is to see if there are any loopholes, and help the states plug these,” said Lav Agarwal, joint secretary, health ministry, on the teams being sent to states.Agarwal last week had led a second team of experts that visited Mumbai in the past one month as the city has been reporting high number of cases since past few weeks.Apart from the health teams, the central government had also constituted Interministerial Central Teams (IMCT) to look into other aspects such as implementation of lockdown, market activities etc. and sent to places from where more cases were being reported. One of the teams was sent to Mumbai, the main problem is of congested spaces because of which maintaining social distancing successfully can be difficult.“The experts had found in many congested areas people share community toilet for which people have to come out of their homes despite the lockdown, especially in slums like Dharavi.It was suggested creating separate toilet structures. And to ensure people did not stay in close proximity, the teams had suggested moving people to different areas in make-shift quarantine facilities,” Puniya Salila Srivastava, joint secretary, home ministry, had said on the feedback. In Indore, Madhya Pradesh, the Covid-19 testing capacity was found to be inadequate, and lockdown measures not followed properly, by the team. “One of the main reasons initially for high cases testing positive in Indore was that the chain of transmission couldn’t be broken as people didn’t really stay indoors during the initial lockdown period. What we saw in subsequent weeks has been a result of that,” said a team member, requesting anonymity.“Mostly the problems that have been found in states where the numbers are high or death rate is high that either lockdown measures were not followed properly, or they weren’t following the testing protocol, or late hospitalization,” the expert added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/central-teams-chart-covid-plan-with-states-flag-gaps/story-yXbBM4irbXHhTbGui3w31O.html
11-05-2020||India||PM Modi to discuss lockdown exit plan with CMs at today’s meet||The Centre told states on Sunday to ensure strict adherence of containment zone guidelines and clear demarcation of the areas with coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases, adding that they should not let any relaxation of the national lockdown lead to chaos, a development that came a day ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s meet with chief ministers.The Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) announced that Modi will hold the fifth video-conference on tackling the Covid-19 outbreak with the chief ministers at 3pm on Monday. At the previous meets, the Prime Minister has taken suggestions from the CMs on the contours and extension of the national lockdown, put in place to contain the infections. Officials have told HT that at Monday’s meet, the PM is likely to discuss further increase in economic activity in the country while also tackling the infections in the containment zones.Also Watch | Will PM-CMs decide on lockdown exit & the man living at airport for 2 months Also read: Number of critical Covid-19 patients has halved across the country, shows dataCabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba met state chief secretaries on Sunday and advised them to ensure that “green zones” – areas that are largely Covid-19-free – remain insulated from the spread of the pathogen, according to an official who was present during the interaction and spoke on condition of anonymity. The states were also asked to allow unhindered movement of health care workers, the official added.An official statement on the meeting also said that many chief secretaries said that “while protection is required from Covid-19, the economic activities also need to be stepped up in a calibrated manner”. The deliberations came a day after Gauba held two back-to-back meetings to identify possible areas that can be opened up after May 17.The country has been under a complete lockdown since March 25, a move aimed at breaking the chain of infections. The number of infections, which have affected more than four million people across the world, rose to 67,085 in India on Sunday. Experts say that a recent relaxation in the lockdown to boost economic activity may lead to an increase in Covid-19 cases.Also read| Covid-19: What you need to know todayWhile restrictions were considerably relaxed on May 4 to boost a sluggish economy, the government is expected to further ease the curbs after May 17, when the lockdown is scheduled to end.The government has begun internal discussions on possible additional relaxations and unlike the previous meet between the PM and the chief ministers, Monday’s video conference will have all CMs speaking on the issue, according to a person aware of the matter. Due to the paucity of time, the previous deliberations had limited numbers of CMs sharing their views.On Sunday, Gauba told the chief secretaries that containment areas have to be well-demarcated to avoid confusion among the public as well as police or health officials and “stringent implementation” of rules has to be ensured, the official quoted above said.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here The Centre has regularly received reports about loosely earmarked containment zones leading to non-adherence of health safety norms and free movement of people, the official added.While the Centre is worried about a surge in the number of Covid-19 cases, the states have been asked to keep an eye on the green zones to ensure these areas remain unaffected.The cabinet secretary also cited reports about the frequent harassment of medical workers and underlined that their movement should be unhindered and they must not face any difficulty due to the restrictions, another official said.As the Centre seeks states’ inputs for the next course of action, senior Congress strategist Jairam Ramesh argued that the Union government must give the states complete freedom to design their own action plans. “It is ridiculous that the Centre is making all plans and asking states to follow it. It should be the other way round. The battle against Covid needs to be de-centralised. States should be free to make their own plans and decide which areas are vulnerable. This green, red and orange zone concept is not working,” Ramesh said.At Sunday’s meet, state officials shared data to show how they were tackling the Covid-19 outbreak. Bharatiya Janata Party-ruled Tripura flagged concerns over a number of positive cases found in Bangladesh’s districts adjacent to the state. The Tripura chief secretary pointed out that the international border was porous and the Centre must ensure that Bangladesh citizens can’t enter Tripura, the second official said.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage The Assam chief secretary underlined that while a large number of migrant workers were returning to the state in special trains, it needed to be given advance notice and sufficient time to set up quarantine facilities for such a large number of people. He was assured that the state would be informed about in-bound train schedules in advance. West Bengal home secretary Alapan Bandopadhyay said that the state has reconciled its Covid-19 data with the Centre’s after the administration was accused of under-reporting of cases. He read out a written demand that for the next phase, the government should adopt a more decentralised approach and a zone-specific plan should be allowed, the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ensure-adherence-to-guidelines-govt-to-states-ahead-of-pm-meet/story-9iORdrCtoBn3CqRgAuWR7N.html
11-05-2020||India||Govt sends aid to Indian Ocean states||India has despatched a warship with two medical teams and medical supplies to help authorities in the Maldives, Mauritius, Madagascar, Comoros and Seychelles combat Covid-19, symbolising the importance attached by New Delhi to its maritime neighbourhood.The Indian Navy’s INS Kesari, a 5,600-tonne landing ship, was deployed following requests for assistance from the Indian Ocean countries, the external affairs ministry said on Sunday. The warship is carrying consignments of essential medicines and food supplies.The two medical assistance teams on board will be deployed in Mauritius and Comoros to help their governments deal with the Covid-19 crisis and a dengue fever outbreak in Comoros.A person familiar with developments said the operation, named Mission Sagar, “implicitly conveys the inclusion of Madagascar and Comoros as part of India’s Indian Ocean vision” and the growing importance of the Indian Ocean region in foreign policy.“This is the first time a single assistance mission is covering all island countries of the western Indian Ocean,” the person said on condition of anonymity. “It also reflects the contiguity of the government’s Indian Ocean policy.”INS Kesari will also deliver consignments of Covid-19-related medicines to Mauritius, Madagascar, Comoros and Seychelles and 600 tonnes of food supplies to the Maldives. It is also carrying a special consignment of ayurvedic medicines for Mauritius in response to a request made by foreign minister Nandcoomar Bodha to his Indian counterpart.The consignments for Madagascar and Comoros include hydroxychloroquine tablets. India supplied 50,000 hydroxychloroquine tablets to the Maldives last month and more supplies were also sent to Mauritius and Seychelles.The Indian Ocean region is now getting the same importance as India’s immediate neighbours, the person cited above said. The Maldives, Sri Lanka, Mauritius and Seychelles were among the first countries to receive Covid-19-related aid from India and a team of select medical personnel was sent to Male to augment the preparedness of authorities there to tackle the pandemic. Special flights have carried two consignments of medicines to Sri Lanka.“This is also the only region where three medical teams have been sent – to the Maldives earlier and now to Mauritius and Comoros. This conveys India’s readiness to deploy manpower and also the confidence in Indian expertise in these countries,” the person said.“Though all the assistance is request-based, these operations display our readiness and capability to step up even as we have challenges at home, and also cement our status as first responder in any crisis,” the person added. The Indian Navy has also played a key role in repatriating some 1,000 Indian nationals from the Maldives since last week. The navy deployed two warships to Male to bring them back.The name of Mission Sagar was inspired by the prime minister’s vision of “Sagar” – Security and Growth for All in the Region. It is also in line with India’s “time-tested role as the first responder in the region”, the external affairs ministry said.Last month, India activated a currency swap arrangement with the Maldives and said it would provide $150 million to help the country mitigate the economic impact of the pandemic. The facility is part of the $400 million currency swap agreement signed in July 2019.India has also deployed a medical rapid response team to Kuwait and provided hydroxychloroquine tablets to many countries in the neighbourhood as grants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-sends-aid-to-indian-ocean-states/story-fF7Xfr4tsLoJd1ploCuoyK.html
11-05-2020||India||One man, 8 profiles and an elaborate hoax||Sameer Chaturvedi woke up on April 1 to a raft of WhatsApp messages. His college friends were discussing the paucity of ventilators to treat Covid-19. On his extended family group, relatives were blaming people who attended a religious congregation in New Delhi for the outbreak. And, a close friend was holding forth on how beauty and brains could come together in his dream woman.The common thread: A woman named Nisha Jindal, supposedly a resident of Chhattisgarh’s capital city Raipur, who had posted in her widely popular Facebook account that representatives of the World Health Organization (WHO) had flown down to Raipur to meet her, and that 10,000 ventilators were being dispatched to the state as a result of the meeting. Screenshots of the post were doing the round of WhatsApp groups.“I first thought someone was pulling an April Fool’s prank on me, so I quickly logged onto Facebook and found her profile. Not only did she have some mutual friends with me but I saw many big people were on her list. I thought she must be someone important,” said Chaturvedi, a small-time businessman in Raigarh town. “She seemed very pretty so I also thought of sending her a request and starting a chat,” he added.Unknown to Sameer, the Facebook post, made on March 26, had stoked suspicion at the police headquarters in Raipur, especially because officials had received several previous complaints that the profile was putting out communal content. A month later, they arrested a 31-year-old man from a small two-room flat in Raipur’s Kabir Nagar locality. In their investigation and questioning, they found that the man, an engineering college drop-out, had put together an elaborate hoax on Facebook with eight fake profiles to churn out misinformation to tens of thousands of people and gained tremendous traction on Facebook and WhatsApp when Covid-19 hit India. At the centre of the fake news machinery was Nisha Jindal, a supposedly 35-year-old mother of one who managed to add top industrialists, journalists, photographers, politicians, activists, bureaucrats and police officers in her social media circle. The bait: Illegally borrowed photographs of Pakistani actor Miraha Pasha, rabid communal commentary and hints of bonhomie with important politicians and bureaucrats. “When we arrested him, he told us he had studied from Harvard. He was laughing at having made a fool out of thousands. He didn’t want money, it seemed he did it for popularity,” said Arif Sheikh, the Raipur superintendent of police.When asked why he impersonated an actor and used a fake name, his answer to the police interrogators was straightforward. “Look at my face, do you think any of those thousands would have followed me if they knew how I really look? What Ravi could never, Nisha Jindal was able to, become famous.” Modest beginnings Pujar was born in a lower-middle class household in Raipur to a state government employee. He studied in the Adarsh Vidyalaya, where students and teachers described him as an unusually quiet boy who kept mostly to himself. “We would joke that we would never see him talking to girls,” said one of his friends, Rahul Kamakar. A second friend, who didn’t want to be named said he was always interested in news. In school, Pujar did poorly in other subjects but was surprisingly good at maths, pursuing a degree in information technology at a local private engineering college after his board examinations in 2009. In 2012, after falling behind on his assignments and failing year-end examinations, his college informed Pujar that he would not be allowed to graduate and he dropped out. It was then that Jindal was born. He lived with his parents in government quarters and spent most of his time on the phone. “We lived in the same house and yet I never knew what he was up to. I don’t know what happened to him but one thing I am sure, he was not anti-Muslim,” said his father, Jagdish Pujar. “He has never fought with anyone or has been violent. My son was very simple, I don’t know what happened to him,” added Jagdish.For the next four years, his friends unsuccessfully asked Pujar many times to take up a job, but they couldn’t even get him to admit that he had failed college. “He would always say, I don’t want to do a small job,” said Rahul. Pujar told his parents that he was preparing for the civil services examination. “I met him a day before the lockdown, he said he was preparing for a competitive exam,” said a third friend who refused to be named. In his spare time, he would share an evening drink of cheap beer with two or three friends. “He would never get drunk. In fact he would take care of us if one of us got out of hand,” said Kamakar. His other passion was cooking chicken that was a favourite snack with friends. “I wonder why he did it, whether he was lonely, or simply ambitious. After all, remember that every important person in our state followed the profile and no one in our circle could ever dream of knowing these people,” said the third friend. Creating a fictitious lifeNisha Jindal first appeared on Facebook in the summer of 2012. Within the span of a couple of months, Pujar created eight supporting profiles of friends, sister, family members of the Jindal family, all of whom were connected on Facebook and amplified Jindal’s photos, posts and comments. All the photos were taken from Pasha’s account.In the first few years, Jindal gained some traction but never made it beyond a small group of friends and people – a common phenomenon on a website that pulled down three billion fake accounts last year – according to data put out by Facebook in 2019 -- with India among the top three markets with such profiles. Apart from biological details, her profile listed professional skills that included archaeology, biology, computer science, fashion designer, weapons expert, microbiologist and classical dancer.In these early years when most updates were personal photos, anecdotes and flirty texts, Jindal mirrored one of the most common fake profiles on Facebook, Angel Priya, of which hundreds of iterations are made by young men every year and which inspired director Raaj Shandilya to make 2019 Ayushmann Khurrana-starrer film, Dream Girl, where the lead actor pretends to be a woman over a telephone service. The nationwide protests that broke out last year after the government amended the citizenship law propelled Jindal’s reach and gave a distinctive communal colour to its content. “We found that the anti-Muslim rhetoric became shriller and she started writing fake things about politicians. Many influential people started sharing her content,” said Abhishek Maheswari, the city superintendent of police.This is also the time Chaturvedi received the first screenshot of Jindal’s post on his WhatsApp group – it was about how the anti Citizenship (Amendment) Act protesters were destroying the country. The likes and shares on her posts went up dramatically. “Pujar would spend 12-14 hours every day on his phone, finding news and then making something up to post on his profile. In our interrogation, we found that he had tremendous knowledge of random trivia; almost everything was copied from the internet,” said Sheikh.Growing bolder with the profile, Pujar started sending out friend requests to important people – including one to Sheikh. “I saw that the profile said she was California-based and there were many prominent business people on the profile... I didn’t accept,” the police officer said. From January, Jindal started posting more about Covid-19 and her supposed meetings with officials of international organisations, including the International Monetary Fund. At the same time, Pujar kept up a steady stream of reposted TikTok videos and personal updates – including one where Jindal declared she is 35 and unmarried. Her posts came at a time fear of the virus was gripping the hinterlands and news about mystery illnesses and miracle cures were flying about not just on social media but also on local newspapers and television channels. Jindal’s misinformation fit neatly into this matrix. “We saw that thousands of people started following her and her posts were getting shared much more on WhatsApp. Everyone thought she knew big people,” said a top police officer on condition of anonymity. The Tablighi Jamaat congregation in New Delhi that the government held responsible for 4,000 cases fuelled her reach and fit neatly into her anti-Muslim tirade. “Her reach was tremendous and her Covid updates were very popular. If someone accused her of being fake, hundreds would crash the comments section defending her. They would say they know her, have met her in real life – just to win her trust and favour,” said Maheswari. The penny dropsOn April 12, Maheswari sent a friend request to Jindal. By then, police had already searched thousands of houses in Shankar Nagar, the address listed in the profile, but come up short. Another effort to get Facebook to cough up details had also come up short. Jindal immediately accepted the request. “She was fond of adding government officers, I saw many other top officials in her list, about 100 senior officers and 200 journalists,” he said. To track the IP address, Maheswari adopted a very Indian routine: Sending “good morning” messages every day with photos of a bouquet of flowers. But for a week, Jindal responded with just emoticons, which were not enough to track down her connection. He finally sent Jindal her profile photo on her messenger inbox and said, “You are very beautiful.” Within minutes, there was a response and the two had started chatting.By the next day, on April 20, the police had traced the mobile phone and found the Pujar house in Kabir Nagar but were still taken aback when they walked into the house. “We were expecting someone very sophisticated. But it was a very modest house and when I looked at Pujar, I started laughing. We realised it was a fake profile,” said Maheswari.Multiple police accounts say when Pujar was arrested, he was amused by how popular the profile had become. The investigation initially focused on possible financial transactions but officers quickly realised that Pujar’s motive was not monetary. “He was proud of the popularity and how many people proposed to him over messenger. But he also seemed biased against Muslims and that may have been another motive,” said the unnamed police official quoted above. Pujar has been arrested under sections 153A (Promoting enmity between different groups) and 295A (Deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and under relevant Sections of Information Technology (IT) Act.Shortly after his arrest, police made Pujar post his real photo on Jindal’s profile and tell thousands of her followers that the account was fake, and that he was fake. “He was still confident, he told us that he was Nisha Jindal and that there was no difference between the two,” said Maheswari. The final post on Jindal’s profile went viral within hour and was screen grabs are still doing the rounds of WhatsApp, Reddit and meme factories. When it landed in Chaturvedi’s inbox a day later, it shocked his circle of friends in Raigarh. The profile was still up – it was taken down a day later – and later that evening, five or six friends gathered. “We drank and laughed at how we had been fooled. One of us even had a crush on her. Actually, in our small town, it was a big deal for someone to know so many big people, to have prominent people, industrialists and politicians follow you,” he said.While scrolling, they saw that a fight had broken out in the comments section between a small group of Jindal faithful and others. One of the profiles, named Avichal Sharma, still defended Jindal, or Pujar. “What’s in the body, the mind, the brain is everything,” was his comment. “As if we shared her content because of its intellect,” Chaturvedi said with a laugh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/one-man-8-profiles-and-an-elaborate-hoax/story-2vWx4Ot7lqrsasXK2UylCI.html
11-05-2020||India||Guidelines for factories to resume operations safely||The first week in which factories reopen after the national lockdown must be used as a trial period in which safety protocols are ensured and high production targets are not set, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) said in detailed guidelines issued on Sunday. These guidelines came days after 12 people were killed in an industrial accident in Visakhapatnam that may have been caused by the long duration of inactivity at the facility.“Due to several weeks of lockdown and the closure of industrial units during the lockdown period, it is possible that some of the operators might not have followed the established SOP (standard operating procedure). As a result, some of the manufacturing facilities, pipelines, valves, etc may have residual chemicals, which may pose risk. The same is true for storage facilities with hazardous chemicals and flammable materials,” NDMA said in its guidelines.Such units should consider the first week of restarting any machinery or chemical unit as the “trial” or “test run” period and “not try to achieve high production targets”, the agency added.Industrial scale operations include the use of chemicals and machinery that require specific cycles of use and maintenance to keep them operating safely and free of hazardous materials that may accumulate as a result of disuse. Since March 25, most of these units have virtually been shut down, raising the risk of accidents.At least 12 people died after a chemical from a factory spread to several villages in Visakhapatnam district in the early hours of Thursday, affecting more than 1,000 people who woke up from their sleep choking and with burning sensation in their skin. The leak was of styrene, which is believed to have turned into gas after a cooling unit at the LG Polymers factory failed, raising the chemical’s temperature to dangerous levels, according to a preliminary incident report filed by district officials.The same day, 14 others were hurt in two other industrial accidents. The first one involved a group of seven cleaning staff who were clearing out an enclosure filled with poisonous gases at a paper mill in Chhattisgarh’s Raigad. The other was an explosion in a boiler that left seven workers hurt at the Neyveli Lignite Corporation’s plant in Tamil Nadu’s Cuddalore.“When Lockout/Tagout procedures are not in place, many energy sources can prove to be hazardous to operators/supervisors who are servicing or maintaining electrical, mechanical or chemical equipment. When heavy machinery and equipment are not maintained periodically, they can become dangerous for the operators/engineers. Combustible liquids, contained gaseous substances, open wires, conveyor belts and automated vehicles make manufacturing facilities a high-risk environment. Improper enforcement of safety codes and improperly labelled chemicals can further pose serious health hazards,” the NDMA advisory said.The NDMA’s directives is with a clear intention to ensure precautionary measures for complete safety and security of labour, employees and the environment, said DK Aggarwal, president, PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry. “There is cost involved for each non-productive day and a delay of a week for trial runs will bring additional cost, but industries should not restart in haste and at the cost of safety and security of workers, staff and the public at large,” said Aggarwal.“There needs to be several layers of early warning systems in place like there is for nuclear plants. All emissions and other data on dashboard should be made available to Central Pollution Control Board, state boards, state disaster management authorities and national disaster management authority,” said SN Tripathi, head of civil engineering department at IIT Kanpur. The NDMA guidelines said that employees should be made aware of the need to identify abnormalities such as strange sounds or smells, exposed wires, vibrations, leaks, smoke, abnormal wobbling, irregular grinding or other potentially hazardous signs that indicate the need for an immediate maintenance or, if required, a shutdown.The guidelines also asked the industry to take the help of local administration in case of any difficulty, and district magistrates were told to ensure that in such instances the industrial unit may be facilitated to run end-to-end operations in the interest of industrial security.NDMA further detailed the steps that specific industry needs to take when they reopen. For example, storage or raw materials units have been asked to “inspect for any signs of spills, wear and tear during the lockdown” as well as check for “already opened storage vessels/containers/bags/silos for possible oxidation/chemical reaction/ rusting/ rotting etc”.Manufacturing units were told to carry out a complete safety audit of the entire unit before taking up starting activities and they should first clean the pipelines, equipment and discharge lines, and factories working 24 hours were asked to consider a one-hour gap between shifts, except those factories or plants that require continuous operations.They were also asked to operate with 33% managerial and administrative staff as per MHA guidelines; but while deciding which particular person to be included in 33% at any given point of time, overriding priority be given to personnel dealing with safety, and to prepare accommodation to isolate workers if needed.The reopening of factories was permitted by the easing of restrictions to the national lockdown from May 4 for all zones as long as factories and industrial units were access-controlled, with employers required to put in place social distancing rules for workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/guidelines-for-factories-to-resume-operations-safely/story-eIaCpWH5gLLyfvr3cshVBK.html
11-05-2020||India||Saifullah Mir aka Ghazi Haider, 26, is Hizbul’s new face of terror in Kashmir||Saifullah Mir aka Ghazi Haider, the 26-year-old who was radicalised to join the Hizbul Mujahideen by Riyaz Naikoo six years ago, will be the Hizbul Mujahideen’s new face of terror in Jammu and Kashmir, a senior security official said on Sunday evening. The official said Saifullah Mir’s appointment to lead the Hizbul in Jammu and Kashmir had been announced by Saleem Hashmi, the spokesperson for the terror group headquartered in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir’s Muzaffarabad.Hashmi also named Zafarul Islam as the so-called deputy chief operational commander in jammu and Kashmir and another terrorist, Abu Tariq Bhai, as his chief military adviser.Naikoo along with his associate Adil Ahmed was killed in an operation carried out by Jammu and Kashmir police and troopers from the 21 Rashtriya Rifles. Naikoo was hiding in a secret bunker in his village.Saifullah Mir, who is also known as Musaib and ‘Doctor Saif’ because he treated terrorists injured in police encounters, is a class 12 pass out from Malangpora in south Kashmir’s Pulwama district unlike his mentor and predecessor Riyaz Naikoo who had completed his graduation. Saifullah Mir opted for vocational training after school. Once he was through with the bio medical course at the government-run ITI in Pulwama, Saifullah got himself a job at Srinagar’s National Institute of Electronics and Information Technology as a technician, according to security officials.He held onto the job for three years before Riyaz Naikoo finally had his way and motivated him to join terror.Security officials said Saifullah had been classified as an ‘A category’ terrorist and had mostly been active in south Kashmir districts of Pulwama, Kulgam and Shopian. He is also said to be completely familiar with Riyaz Naikoo’s network and activities to raise funds by looting orchard owners and get cuts from illicit cultivation of opium in south Kashmir.Police officers in Kashmir said apart from terrorism, the Hizbul Mujahideen has also been involved in narco trade.Investigators had recently busted a Hizbul Mujahideen terror funding module with the arrest of Hilal Ahmad Wagay, a resident of Nowgam, Awantipora, Jammu and Kashmir. Wagay was caught with Rs 29 lakh cash in Amritsar, by Punjab Police on April 25.“This money was being transported to the Kashmir valley to be handed over to Riyaz Naikoo (now killed), Chief operational commander of Hizbul Mujahideen. This case has been taken over by NIA,” the National Investigation Agency had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/saifullah-mir-aka-ghazi-haider-26-is-hizbul-s-new-face-of-terror-in-kashmir/story-NOgRn012nF6Ks752QxvjJL.html

He is stable and currently under observation with specialists examining him,” the hospital source said..There was no official statement by AIIMS on Manmohan Singh’s admission to the hospital.Singh’s office later confirmed that he had been admitted but underlined that he was doing fine.“He is okay. He was taken to the hospital as he had fever due to the side-effect of the medication given yesterday. He is under observation,” the former PM’s office said.Senior politicians from the Congress and other political parties wished the 87-year-old leader a speedy recovery.Congress president Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi also enquired about the health of the distinguished economist who joined the Congress and served as prime minister for two terms. With the Congress back in the opposition, he plays a lead role in advising his party on economic issues. Last month, he accepted a request from Congress-ruled Punjab to guide the state’s economy to recovery after the Covid-19 crisis is over.Among the other prominent politicians who expressed concern at the former PM’s health was Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot.“Much worried to know former PM Dr Manmohan Singh ji has been admitted to AIIMS. I wish him speedy recovery and pray for his good health and long life,” Gehlot tweeted.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted he too was deeply concerned about Dr Singh’s health. “Hope he makes a full recovery soon. All of India is praying for our former PM,” said Kejriwal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-pm-manmohan-singh-admitted-to-aiims-cardio-thoracic-ward-report/story-HNhlLxqin1xKMtDTP2UmTP.html
11-05-2020||India||Security forces on red alert over terror bombing threat in Kashmir||Security forces in Jammu and Kashmir have been placed on red alert over the plans of Pakistan-backed terror group Jaish-e-Mohammed to carry out attacks targeting army and paramilitary forces on Monday. Security forces expect the terrorists to carry out the attack using a car bomb or a suicide bomber.The heightened security in Kashmir coincides with the terror group Hizbul Mujahideen naming Ghazi Haider aka Saifullah Mir as the next chief chief of the terror group in Kashmir to replace Riyaz Naikoo who was killed in an encounter this week.“Ghazi Haider is a nom de guerre. Ghazi means Islamic warrior, Haider is brave,” a security official in Kashmir said, adding that operations to locate the new Hizbul chief would begin soon. The terror outfit has also readied its second line of leadership. Ghazi Haider would have a deputy, Zafar ul Islam, and a chief military adviser Abu Tariq Bhai.For now, the immediate priority of the security forces is to neutralise the Jaish-e-Mohammed threat to convoys of security forces on May 11. The terrorist group has been planning the possible attacks on Monday for days. Last week, according to intelligence reports, Mufti Abdul Rauf Asghar, the de facto chief of Jaish, had met his handlers at Pakistan military’s Inter Services Intelligence.Also Read: At NSA Ajit Doval’s big Kashmir meet, a stinker for Pak and a piece of advice Security officials said the choice of May 11 for an attack coincides with the 17th day of Ramadan when the Battle of Badr was fought and won by a few hundred soldiers in Saudi Arabia. In Islamic history, it is seen as a huge victory in the early days of Islam and a turning point.It is also the 22nd anniversary of India’s second round of Pokhran nuclear tests in 1998 when India became a nuclear weapons state with a capability to deliver airborne and land-based nuclear devices.The Jaish-e-Mohammed, which has a large proportion of foreign terrorists in its ranks, is expected to use local Kashmiris for the bombing as it had done in the Pulwama car bombing last year that targeted a convoy of CRPF troopers.This lowers the cost of a terrorist attack for Pakistan-based terror groups, a Kashmir police officer said. It is also convenient because it helps its backers in Pakistan claim that the attack was carried out by local Kashmiris and is part of, as Prime Minister Imran Khan calls it, an indigenous resistance movement.Counter-terror officials in North Block said the Northern Army commander and chiefs of Central Reserve Police Force and Jammu and Kashmir police’s special operations groups had already been sensitised about the possible attack.As a precaution, all movement of convoys has been placed under strong monitoring and will move out under strong protection with road opening parties in accordance with procedures. This will keep everyone safe, an official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/security-forces-on-red-alert-ahead-of-terror-bombing-threat-in-kashmir/story-duMlV2f8SX3oBURPD353PN.html

11-05-2020||India||No money left, Shikara owners struggle to survive in Srinagar||The road along Dal Lake in Srinagar ordinarily brims with tourists, who come to bask in the commanding views of the snowcapped mountains.But for the last months, with the tourism sector reeling under a massive loss followed by the coronavirus enforced lockdown has left many houseboat owners worried to fend for themselves and fight for their survival.Bashir Ahmad, 50, a Shikara owner who has been rowing his boat for tourists on Dal Lake for 25 years now, has seen many bad patches in his life but he said life in Covid-19 lockdown has been worse.All his savings have exhausted and now he is struggling to feed his wife and three daughters. “Whatever money I had earned has been exhausted. We are sustaining on rice which the administration has provided us with. As age is not by my side, I cannot do hard labour and there is no other work anywhere,” he saidAijaz Ahmad Chachoo’s story is no different. His Shikara which was built at a cost of ₹120,000 in 2018 has been idle for months now. “We are somehow sustaining by limiting our daily food intake,” he said.The 32-year-old had taken a loan of ₹30,000 to build his boat and hoped that tourist arrival in 2019 would fetch him good returns which were dashed after Centre’s decision to put the region under restrictions for months. Now the lockdown since mid-March has things worse for him.Around 30,000 people are directly dependent on the tourism industry including people owing some 4,500 registered Shikaras while there are lakhs who indirectly benefit from the sector. Many of these Shikara owners are poor and earn hand to mouth.Javaid Ahmad, a Shikarawala who also does tailoring work, says that the situation of many families dependent on Shikaras was critical. “It is total shutdown and many families are suffering. Most of these families are poor and dependent on 4-5 months of tourist season. They would sustain their families for the whole year only if the tourist season succeeded,” he said.Tourism nosedived from August last year as days before the August 5 decision of the Centre to revoke the special status of Jammu and Kashmir and with the government asking tourists to leave the region. Then restrictions, communication blockade, and uncertain situation kept tourists away in most of the previous year as well this year.Umar Zaroor, 28, a Shikara owner who is taking care of his six younger siblings and mother after his father’s death, has now started to do labour work as he feels that the tourism is not going to revive here this year as well even after the lockdown will be lifted.“We know it is going to be the same even after the lockdown period is over. It is better to be prepared than relying on false hopes of tourism revival here,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-money-left-houseboat-owners-struggle-to-survive-in-srinagar/story-3TmoBpI5h3Jp46ah5UqOeO.html
11-05-2020||India||Railways geared up to run 300 Shramik Special trains a day: Piyush Goyal||The Indian Railways is geared up to run 300 trains a day to ferry stranded migrant labourers to their hometowns, railways minister Piyush Goyal said on Sunday, while also appealing to states to ramp up efforts to ensure that the workers reach their destinations across the country in the next three-four days.According to his ministry, the railways ran till Saturday a total of 364 Shramik Special trains. Out f the 90 planned on Saturday, 64 were already in transit till the filing of this report. So far, railways ferried 450,000 passengers.“As per the directions of Hon’ble PM Narendra Modi ji, Railways is fully geared up to run 300 Shramik Special trains every day at short notice since the last six days,” Goyal tweeted.“I appeal to all the States to give permission to evacuate and bring back their stranded migrants so that we can get all of them back to their homes in the next 3-4 days itself,” he said in another tweet.Shramik Special trains, which began on May 1, are bound for a single destination without any stoppages. Usually, they have 24 coaches with each carrying a little over 50 passengers in place of the total capacity of 72, taking the total number of passengers per train to up to 1,200. This means 300 trains a day for the next four days would be able to carry over a million passengers.The Shramik Special trains are being run only after a concurrence is given by states that are sending the passengers as well as those receiving them, the ministry said. In an earlier guideline, the Centre asked both sides to coordinate for the transit of migrant workers who are stuck across India due to the ongoing lockdown prompted by the coronavirus disease.According to the Economic Survey 2016-17 that used new metrics to give updated data on migration, there was an annual interstate migration flow of close to 9 million from 2011 to 2016 in a “circular” (to and from) fashion based on data from railways. According to states’ estimates on April 30, around 10 million workers were stranded across the country; many of them struggling after losing their jobs in the wake of the lockdown. Experts, too, pointed out that the number of stranded migrants could be more than the central government’s estimates even though several of them have already reached their homes by special buses and these trains.In the first week of April, a status report submitted by the Centre to the Supreme Court said a little over a million migrant workers and others were housed at 26,476 relief and active shelter camps across the country. Of them, 630,000 were in government camps and the rest in those run by non-government organisations.“The estimates by the railway minister are based on the figure of roughly 600,000 migrants in government relief camps...However, it is estimated that there are roughly 60-65 million interstate migrant workers. Even if we assume that only 50% of them want to travel back, then the number of trains being suggested are not enough,” said Rajendran Narayanan, assistant professor, Azim Premji University. “Another issue that the migrants are facing is also for registering themselves for the trains. For a migrant to travel, he has to register in both states’ (originating and terminating) websites. There is a huge mess with the compatibility on their portals and this is why there should have been one central platform to do that. The other issue is that most of them do not have smartphones, and most who have not been paid have not had the currency to be able to recharge their phones. The government should ensure a paper-based registration in every ward and town,” he added. According to the railways ministry, a total of 287 trains have reached their destinations across 11 states — Andhra Pradesh (1 train), Bihar (87 trains), Himachal Pradesh (1 train), Jharkhand (16 trains), Madhya Pradesh (24 trains), Maharashtra (3 trains), Odisha (20 trains), Rajasthan (4 trains), Telangana (2 trains), Uttar Pradesh (127 trains), West Bengal (2 trains). These trains have departed from states such as Gujarat, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, Karnataka, Kerala, Punjab, Rajasthan and Telangana.Uttar Pradesh and Bihar have taken in the maximum number of migrants back with more than 80,000 people each, according the internal railway ministry data. They were followed by Madhya Pradesh and Jharkhand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/railways-geared-up-to-run-300-shramik-special-trains-a-day-goyal/story-2we3GaJxZcysi0DWnJNvuI.html
11-05-2020||Editorials||Open up after May 17||As India enters the final week of its extended lockdown, there is a paradox confronting policymakers, which was visible in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s meeting with chief ministers on Monday. The lockdown was imposed when the country had just over 500 cases. Today, India has close to 70,000 cases. The lockdown has not flattened the curve, though it has slowed the spread of the infection. Is this, then, the right time to end the lockdown? The answer is yes — but with caveats. Each phase of India’s lockdown has looked different, with varying degree of relaxations introduced in red, orange and green zones since May 4. But given the intricate ways in which supply chains are tied together, urban spaces are organised, and the difficulties in implementation, it is clear that while sound in principle, this has been too complex and nuanced a policy framework to be implemented smoothly. It has also not led to the adequate opening of the economy. The government seems to recognise this, and has increasingly begun preparing citizens to learn to live with the virus. Opening up of rail travel, even if in a limited manner, is another hint at the resumption of activities. At the same time, as the PM indicated, the Centre wants to ensure a degree of control over activities to prevent an unmanageable spread of the disease. While opinion among the states is divided on the lockdown, there is a consensus on the need for more economic activities. Given the economic distress, the fiscal pressure on the states, and the fact that the lockdown is yielding diminishing returns on the health front, the government now needs to open up India. This should be accompanied with five measures. One, give states the authority to declare red, orange and green zones and let them decide on the restrictions they may want, particularly in containment zones — even as the Centre provides them whatever support they need. Two, allow inter-state travel — but primarily by road, while keeping rail and air travel limited, meeting social distancing norms. Three, allow opening up of offices — but with an advisory, not a directive, that work from home should be preferred where possible. Four, keep educational institutions and recreational public places shut for another month. And five, each time a case is reported, institute a firm drill of testing, contact tracing, and isolation. It will be difficult, but India can’t remain closed anymore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/open-up-after-may-17/story-6Sx5PSTBiKJ4tF9KtPDMiP.html
11-05-2020||Editorials||Scoring on the diplomatic front||This is a peculiar moment in global politics. There is no sign greater than the coronavirus pandemic that the fate of nations are intertwined, and that there challenges which do not respect borders. This should have, logically, given strength to multilateralism. But the opposite has happened. Countries have turned more insular, focused on their domestic priorities. The fact that the rift between the United States (US) and China has grown hasn’t helped the cause of global cooperation. And international institutions which are supposed to provide leadership such as the World Health Organization face a serious crisis of credibility. Given this backdrop, India has done well on the diplomatic front. It has stayed away from the US-China diplomatic tiff, seeking to leverage its relationship with both in the quest to battle the pandemic. It has used every platform to push its point of view, from convening a meeting of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc) to participating in a meeting of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) countries to nudging a conference of G20 countries. Both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and external affairs minister S Jaishankar have been in touch with counterparts across the world. Most significantly, as reported by Hindustan Times on Monday, it has decided to provide assistance to over 90 countries, including drugs, testing kits and other medical support. Quiet and effective diplomacy at this stage, including building goodwill with other countries, will help India at a moment of realignment in the international system.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/scoring-on-the-diplomatic-front/story-8XdY0KiRg8gKZycXCRHa8H.html
