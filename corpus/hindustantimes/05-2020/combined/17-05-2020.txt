Under the Vande Bharat Mission, as the first schedule dovetails into the second schedule of flights, the Government of India (GoI) plans to bring 50,000 stranded Indians back to the country by the end of May. These are some of the responsibilities that the GoI has been engaged in as a response to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) crisis, even as we contemplate reopening domestic aviation. But what has the Opposition been engaged in during this critical time? A credible Opposition is imperative for democratic functioning. This becomes even more important in times of crises. The challenges of governance to deal with the pandemic are setting a new template. The changing stances of the Opposition that seek to use this humanitarian crisis as an opportunity to reclaim their lost political relevance will be scrutinised with the same care that the government’s activities will be subjected to. India was among the first to wake up to the threat of the pandemic by screening passengers, stopping flights and enforcing a nationwide lockdown. When the nation emerged as a prescient and responsible nation globally in having taken pre-emptive measures to stop the spread of the virus, the Opposition called the lockdown sudden, harsh and unilateral. If it was not for the lockdown, we would have found ourselves in the same boat as many of the more developed nations where more than thousands have been dying every day. Even as GoI initiated immediate support to farmers, construction workers, poor women, elderly, labourers, low-salaried workers and other vulnerable sections under the ~1.7-lakh crore Pradhan Mantri Gareeb Kalyan package, the Opposition suggested that the government doesn’t care for the poor. Several facts such as the approval of 6.3 million loans worth ~86,600 crore in agriculture between March 1 to April 30, and an additional allocation of ~40,000 crore under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme as compared to last year, to benefit wage seekers fly in the face of such falsehood. The Opposition’s response to the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan (Self-reliant India Campaign) has been particularly surprising. Before the announcement, the Opposition talked of improving liquidity and extending support to micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). When the details of the ambitious and holistic package extending several innovative measures for MSMEs, at the cost of over ~6 lakh crore were announced, prominent members of the Opposition changed the goalpost, suggesting that no measures had been taken for migrant workers. In their zeal to criticise, they were perhaps blind to the fact that most migrant workers are in fact employed in MSMEs, and these steps would benefit them. The next day, when specific measures to assist our migrant workers by giving them one-nation, one-ration card for access to Public Distribution Scheme (PDS), affordable rental housing through public-private partnership, interest subvention for the Mudra Shishu Loans and credit for street vendors were announced, some Opposition members tried to belittle them by suggesting that street vendors do not go to banks for credit and take loans at 1% per day. Through the several initiatives over the past six years such as the Jan Dhan Yojna, direct benefit transfer, Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, Ayushman Bharat Yojana and Ujjwala Yojana, the Centre has used technology to provide the benefits of governance to the most vulnerable sections. The government will partner with non-banking financial companies, microfinance institutions and banks to extend working capital loans to street vendors, and interest subvention scheme under the Deendayal Antoyodaya Yojana-National Urban Livelihoods Mission will be worked out to reward vendors for good repayment behaviour and upscale their entitlement for bigger loans. Under the one-nation, one-ration card initiative, 670 million beneficiaries in 23 states, covering 83% of PDS population, will be covered by national portability by August.Changing track, some Opposition members have held that easy loans for MSMEs do not constitute a stimulus as a loan is normal banking practice and only fiscal measures count. But people understand that a stimulus is anything that helps people, especially getting their businesses back on their feet. By giving credit guarantees, the government is trying to stop companies from going bankrupt and improving liquidity to MSMEs will help them to restart activities quickly. If this is not a stimulus, what is?Similar intellectual ineptitude has been shown in response to the prime minister’s call to undertake far-reaching land, labour, liquidity and legal reforms to make India self-reliant by leveraging demand in the country. Even though the prime minister specified that the approach is to be self-reliant by participating and leading the global value chains without being self-centred or inward-looking, the Opposition resorted to scaremongering about multinational corporations being shown the door when the exact opposite is being attempted by the government.As more steps are announced for the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan , the Opposition will be further exposed. In a democracy, when the main Opposition party fails to win even 10% of the seats in the Lok Sabha, a certain level of desperation is understandable. But, if it loses its ability to engage in constructive criticism in this haste to weave false narratives, it further compromises its relevance in the political system.

17-05-2020||News||Indian states are short of money. They need help | Opinion||The announcement by Prime Minister Narendra Modi of the Rs 20-lakh crore Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan (Self-reliant India Campaign) package left many scrambling with the fiscal maths — where would the resources come from and how would they be structured? Over the past five days, details have emerged; these include increasing the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) allocations, easing concerns of micro, small and medium enterprises, ending coal monopoly, and ensuring farmers credit. The last tranche also focussed on a much-needed aspect — addressing the fiscal health of states.We analysed the revenue and expenditures of 17 states to ascertain the status of their finances prior to the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and assess their capacity to deal with the crisis. Our findings suggest that recent changes in India’s fiscal architecture — including the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime, and increase in state shares for the Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs) — had placed state finances in a precarious position, even prior to the crisis.The dependency of states on the Centre for revenues has increased, with the share of the revenue from own sources declining from 55% in 2014-15 to 50.5% in 2020-21. While part of this is inherent in India’s fiscal structure, wherein states are the big spenders and the Centre controls the purse strings, the situation has been exacerbated by the introduction of the GST. Barring a few exceptions, such as petroleum products, property tax, and alcohol excise, indirect taxes have, to a large degree, been subsumed under the GST regime, eroding the ability of states to raise their own revenues.Typically, some of this imbalance is corrected through a release of tax devolution to states. Moreover, to offset the loss in revenue due to the changed taxation system, the GST regime includes a provision wherein if tax collection falls below a growth rate of 14% for state GST, the Centre disburses a GST compensation. Our analysis, however, finds that actual taxes devolved to states have remained consistently lower than those projected by the 14th Finance Commission (FC) — a shortfall of around Rs 6.84 lakh crore between 2015-2020. This has been driven by an increase in the share of gross revenues coming from cesses and surcharges imposed by the Centre — which aren’t shared with states — from 2.3% in the early 1980s to as high as 15% in the recent period as per the Reserve Bank of India, and a shortfall in actual tax collection. While the Centre released Rs 46,038 crore in April as per the original budget, subsequent instalments will tell us whether the trend of shortfalls will continue. Adding to state woes is the significant divergence in past periods between the amount of GST compensation owed and the actual payments made, including for states such as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand that need greater fiscal support. Even before Covid-19 hit, 11 states estimated a revenue growth rate below the estimated 14% level, implying higher amounts will be owed as GST compensation. With the bulk of the states’ GST coming from goods such as electronics, fashion, and entertainment — all of which have been impacted by the pandemic — these revenues are likely to decline further. The second major source for revenues from the Centre is CSSs that are aimed at ensuring a minimum standard of public service provision across the country. Though the overall funding through CSSs has declined for many states following the 14th FC recommendations, they still constitute a significant portion of revenue. However, CSSs tend to be unpredictable, with releases determined on meeting certain conditionalities. In 2019-20, the total shortfall between estimated budgets and revised estimates was Rs 14,794 crore. One such conditionality is the requirement of states to put a portion of their own funds for CSSs. In October 2015, this share increased from 15%-25% to as high as 50% for several schemes, curbing the fiscal flexibility of states by ring-fencing revenues back into CSSs. The recent circular by the Centre, clarifying that it would not cut CSS funds, but will also not decrease the State share, will be of little comfort to states at a time when the greatest need is one of flexibility to meet local needs.Expenditure analysis shows that in 2020-21, states expected only around 75% of their total expenditure to be met through revenue receipts, with the rest coming from other sources such as external borrowings. This is even after many states had anticipated lower expenditure for health and the social sector. While expenditures are likely to rise in response to the pandemic, with over one-third of funding already committed to salaries, pensions and interest payments, finding additional resources will be hard. The increase by 60% in the limits for short-term borrowings are unlikely to meet the high, longer-term borrowing requirements. Sunday’s announcement of increasing states’ borrowing limits from 3% of GSDP to 5%, resulting in an additional Rs 4.28 lakh crore also comes with reform conditionalities and only 0.5% — or Rs 2,140 crore — as untied, which states can spend as per needs.There is no question that the pandemic and the lockdown have brought various aspects of socioeconomic life to a standstill. The slowdown of production and consumption is expected to generate medium- and longer-term repercussions on the economy, in terms of its revenue-raising abilities as well as expenditures. The ability of the State to respond effectively will be determined by how quickly it can move away from a business-as-usual model to what some have referred to as a war-time economy. It remains to be seen if the measures extended by the Centre and RBI will be adequate for states to tide over the crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/indian-states-are-short-of-money-they-need-help/story-PiS7gwc1dxpuJZCZqSdJiO.html

17-05-2020||Chandigarh||Rebel AAP MLAs question tweaked mining policy||Four rebel Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLAs, led by Kanwar Sandhu, have raised questions over the state government’s tweaked mining policy in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, alleging that the state was staring at huge losses. The other three legislators are Jagdev Singh Kamalu, Pirmal Singh Khalsa and Jagtar Singh Hissowal.“If the interim policy announced on May 12 for the next one month is any indication, the state is set to suffer a monetary loss of more than Rs 150 crore,” Sandhu claimed, adding that the government must clarify to the people as to how much money had accrued to the state from mining since June 2019, when the auctions were done. He claimed that under this, 196 quarries had been auctioned across seven blocks for Rs 306 crore a year (roughly Rs 25 crore per month). Sandhu claimed that now only 16 sites are being operationalised for a month against which a paltry sum of Rs 4.85 crore would come to the government. Sandhu alleged that even as the state government was not being given any royalty and revenue on the plea of not environmental clearance, most quarries had started operating illegally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/rebel-aap-mlas-question-tweaked-mining-policy/story-PacYrkCTcjWkqT4SPOoruM.html

17-05-2020||Chandigarh||Exporters flush with orders, good season expected for basmati growers in Punjab||Basmati exporters have asked the growers of this aromatic variety in the state to increase area under cultivation, saying that they have orders in hand, despite the covid-19 pandemic affecting most other sectors of the economy. “We are flush with orders from West Asia, Arabian countries, Europe, Canada and the US. We have asked farmers to increase area under cultivation and would purchase the entire basmati crop at a good remunerative price,” says Ashok Sethi, president, Punjab Rice Exporters’ Association. He added countries around the world were securing buffer stocks, leading to the orders. He added exports of basmati from the country were expected to touch Rs 40,000 crore this year, an increase of 15% over Rs 35,000 crore last year. Punjab is expected to contribute around 40% of the exports, at around Rs 15,000 crore. Sethi added the association has asked basmati growers to grow 1718, 1509 and 1121 varieties as these were in huge demand, both in national and international markets. Sethi added that the market was buoyant despite the fact that Iran was not importing (its share in India’s total export was around 33% till two years ago) due to trade sanctions. “Despite the fact that there is no change is the sanctions scenario there is buoyancy in basmati export from India,” said Sethi.The export market has also come alive as rice exporters and state agriculture department learnt from the challenge the industry faced three years ago, when European countries rejected basmati consignments on traces of insecticides. “The impact of the state-wide campaign we ran then has shown results, as farmers have saved Rs 400 crore by cutting down on usage of pesticides,” said Punjab agriculture secretary Kahan Singh Pannu, adding that his department was in touch with basmati farmers and the state was committed to growing the aromatic variety over 17-18 lack acre. The total crop output is expected at 30 lakh tonne, and with the yield at 18 quintal per acre, a farmer can earn more the traditional paddy. Basmati is grown over large tracts in Tarn Taran, Amritsar, Gurdaspur, Ferozepur, Fazilka, Muktsar, Hoshiarpur and Kapurthala districts. Last year, the Minimum Support Price (MSP) of basmati was Rs 1,840 per quintal, which is expected to cross Rs 1,900 in the current season, though Punjab government has demanded Rs 2,900 from the Centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/exporters-flush-with-orders-good-season-expected-for-basmati-growers-in-punjab/story-9vfYkzetaZ0NDj6OVchDyJ.html

17-05-2020||City||Realtors welcome Centre’s relief package, hope it will revive the sector||NOIDA: Real estate developers in Gautam Budh Nagar have welcomed the Centre’s relief package to revive economy amid the Covid-19 crisis and said that it will impact the realty sector positively. One of the decisions that will benefit in the long term is that now corporate insolvency and bankruptcy proceedings will not be initiated against any company, including real estate ones, for the next one year, they said. In the district, there are a number of developers facing corporate insolvency. Many other realtors, who have failed to finish and deliver the flats to homebuyers, were on the verge of facing insolvency proceedings. But after the recent announcement of the Union ministry of finance, they will not face any legal proceedings for the next one year. In corporate insolvency, homebuyers have failed to get any justice in the past, said the developers, adding that builders will not be put into defaulters’ category if they defaulted on loans due to the Covid-19 pandemic.“The extension of project completion date by six months for housing projects, allocation of Rs 75,000 crore for non- banking finance companies and housing finance companies, reduction in TDS by 25% and other measures would help stimulate demand and improve liquidity in the real estate sector to a great extent. Although the relief as sought by the realty sector has not been addressed, the stimulus has something to offer for the industry. But the government must allow one year additional time to finish and deliver delayed projects. We hope it will be done soon,” said RK Arora, Uttar Pradesh president for National Real Estate Development Council (NAREDCO), a builders’ group.The district has at least 600 ongoing realty projects and the builders hope that after the Centre, the UP government will also make positive announcements to revive the sector. Following instructions from the UP government, on Friday, the Noida authority officials held a meeting in Sector 6 administrative building with the developers on the measures to revive the sector. The meeting was held after the UP industry minister assured of help to the builders.“We are brainstorming on the demands made by the developers and soon the government will take final decisions on their issues,” said Satish Mahana, UP industry minister.Experts hope that recent announcements made by the Centre will create a positive sentiment in the real estate sector.“The ministry of finance announced that any debt incurred during Covid-19 for a company will be excluded from the default category under Indian Bankruptcy Code. Additionally, the ministry announced that no fresh insolvency will be initiated for one year, so impacted businesses can focus on survival and recovery for this period. This measure, along with previously announced sops such as extension of loan moratoriums and project completion deadlines can come to the rescue of small developers who are particularly impacted by the funding crunch and low sales,” said Prashant Thakur, director and head (research), Anarock Property Consultants.Dr Harish Sharma, executive director of Rudrabhishek Enterprises Limited, an urban development & infrastructure consultant, said that the relief package announced by the government will not only give a big push to the economy but will also infuse the positivity among the businesses in the country.“The first tranche provided the much needed liquidity support to the MSMEs and a breather to the real estate sector, the second trance while focusing on migrant workers, street vendors and farmers provided an impetus to the housing sector by extending CLSS and promising affordable rental accommodation to migrants and urban poor,” Sharma said. ,||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/realtors-welcome-centre-s-relief-package-hope-it-will-revive-the-sector/story-hhpbZU7pU63AAxBQuVRtWO.html

I was coughing and had visited a government hospital to seek help. There, they gave me some medicines. About a week ago I developed some mild fever and visited a private doctor. He advised a Covid test. I got tested from a private lab and the result came out positive on Saturday,” the woman, who lives in Sanjay Colony in Arthala, said.“Since then I was staying home with my family, which consists three minors and my husband. They were all anxious. After the reports came, I visited two government hospital to get myself admitted but they told me that admission can only be done when health department teams recommends so as per procedure,” she added.The woman’s son said that a health department team finally arrived around12.30pm on Sunday and took her to ESI Hospital in Sahibabad for getting admitted.“The other five members, including me, were sent to quarantine at a facility in Dasna. Since Saturday, all of us were living in anxiety. We live in a small house and the chances of the infection having spread is pretty high. Although I made my mother stay in the corridor of the house, but the delay on part of the hospital may cost us dear,” he added.Dr NK Gupta, chief medical superintendent (CMO), confirmed that the woman tested positive for Covid-19.“Her reports did not arrive at our office till Saturday night. I spoke to the concerned department and was told that the report was finally received on Sunday morning. We immediately rushed a team to take the woman to ESI hospital. The woman had more complications, like tuberculosis, so we later shifted her to a L3 category hospital of Meerut Medical College at Meerut. There has been a delay in getting her admitted,” CMO added.Meanwhile, residents of Kaushambi also said that they had one more Covid-19 positive case on May 15 but the apartment from where the case was detected was yet to be sealed.“The building has not been sealed till date and no sanitization has been taken up. Besides no history or tests of close contacts have been taken up. We have told officials about the issue. There has been delay on part of the health department,” said VK Mittal, president of Kaushambi apartments’ RWA.Likewise, the residents of Ramprastha also said that their locality had another Covid-19 positive case.“We had a positive case in block C on May 15 and the patient is admitted to a hospital in Delhi. The first case here was reported on May 1 and the area was sealed a week later. Now, there is a second case which has emerged. But there has been no sealing and no testing of residents living in the same building,” said AK Jain, resident of Ramprastha. CMO Gupta responded by saying that recommendation for sealing has been sent to the concerned department in both cases.“We have taken activities of sanitisation in the two areas and recommendation for sealing has been sent to the concerned officials. Our containment activities have started,” he added.On Sunday, the tally of Covid-19 positive cases in Ghaziabad stood at 186 with addition of eight cases, out of which two are from Khoda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-40-year-old-covid-patient-forced-to-be-home-for-24-hrs-before-hospitalisation/story-VtQGzKPncJFqSkQV7usw6N.html
17-05-2020||City||Gzb: Occupancy in shelter homes swells as cops pick up migrant workers from city roads||Ghaziabad: A day after the Uttar Pradesh chief minister directed that no migrant worker should be allowed to walk afoot or boarding trucks for their home towns, the Ghaziabad police on Sunday brought in thousands of such people to various shelter homes set up across the city during the Covid-19 lockdown.As a result, almost all the temporary shelter homes on Sunday were packed to capacity. However, the migrant workers who were picked up by the police complained of non-availability of food and poor basic facilities at these shelter homes. Some migrants were even brought to the Angel Mall in Kaushambi, officials said.Mohammad Naseem, a migrant worker who is a native of Barabanki in UP, was picked up by cops and taken to the shelter home at a government school near Sahibabad railway station. He had come to the city from Shahdara in Delhi. “I started from Delhi at 4pm, but was picked up by cops in Sahibabad and brought to the school where about 2,000 people are already there. They also misbehaved with me. The toilets at the school cannot cater to such a large gathering. Nobody is following the social distancing norms. Many women, some of them pregnant, are left in lurch as they are waiting for a bus home,” Naseem said, adding that the people are given only some bananas to eat.Kaushal Pal, a pregnant woman from Auraiya district in UP who reached Ghaziabad from Maujpur, Delhi, was also brought to the school on Saturday night along with her two minor children and husband, a daily wager.“We were hoping to get some bus or truck to our home town. But the cops brought us to the school around 9.30pm. I could not get food as it is distributed only to people who are at the main entrance of the school. There are people from UP and Bihar, with children and women sitting in the scorching heat. There is no social distancing here and we are scared if any one of us is Covid-19 positive,” she said on Sunday.Senior police officials said that all the migrant workers are being made to stay at the shelter homes for some time, and the administration will arrange food and other essential services for them. “We expect that the shelter homes are fully occupied as over 5,000 migrants were taken to these facilities in Kaushambi, Sahibabad and other city areas. The administration will arrange food and water for them. Also, we will arrange buses for them to take them to their respective home towns,” said Manish Mishra, superintendent of police (city).When asked about the complaints of poor basic facilities at the shelter homes, district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said, “We are making all the arrangements at the shelter homes and also trying to improve any shortcomings.” Regarding the lockdown 4.0 that will come into effect from May 18 (Monday), Pandey, in a statement issued on Sunday, said that the current situation will prevail in the district till further instructions are received from the state government.The cops even fined some taxi drivers found to carry migrant workers. “I was ferrying two migrant workers from a shelter home at Sukh Sagar Farm House in Kavi Nagar around 10am to Ghanta Ghar Ramlila Ground when some cops stopped me. They issued challan of Rs 1,300 and threatened to book me in a theft case. Then they shooed the migrants away,” said Sanjay Kumar, a private taxi driver from Shastri Nagar.Migrants like Dileep Kumar, a native of Unnao who stays in Noida’s Sector 12/22, were lucky enough to reach up to Lal Kuan in Ghaziabad from Noida.“Wherever the cops stopped us, we requested them to let us go. My two children are sitting on the cart which I use for selling vegetables and my wife is walking alongside. We had been going to administration offices in Noida for the past five days, but were driven away by cops. So, I decided to start the journey at 9am on Sunday,” Dileep said.“We were 15-20 people and had booked a mini truck for Rs 15,000 for taking us to Unnao. But the cops did not allow us to move out when we started at 2am on Sunday. I was staying at a friend’s house as my landlord turned me out. We are dependent on local people for food and water,” he added.The officials said that two trains were arranged for migrant workers to Bihar from Ghaziabad railway station.“A train left on Sunday from Ghaziabad to Darbhanga in Bihar carrying 1,470 passengers. The second was bound for Purnia and will take along 1,420 migrants. In order to tackle the rush, on Sunday, we allowed even those to board the trains who had not registered online. But this is only for Sunday and a review will be done,” said Santosh Kumar Vaishya, additional district magistrate who is supervising the passenger operations at Ghanta Ghar Ramlila Ground.Meanwhile, the administration officials on Sunday night said in a statement that there is a proposal of running three Shramik special trains that will leave Ghaziabad everyday for UP cities of Gorakhpur (via Lucknow, Barabanki, Gonda, Basti and Khalilabad), Varanasi (via Lucknow, Fatehpur and Prayagraj) and Azamgarh (via Lucknow, Barabanki, Faizabad, Akbarpur, Shahganj and Sarai Mir).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gzb-occupancy-in-shelter-homes-swells-as-cops-pick-up-migrant-workers-from-city-roads/story-hZr5N5ibbYjFrGakgLye5K.html

This led to a massive build-up at the Delhi-UP Gate border — which was sealed by authorities two weeks ago— on Delhi-Meerut Expressway near Indirapuram, with police stopping and taking them to shelter homes.The Yogi Adityanath government had asked police and administrative officials to ensure that no migrant worker travelled on foot or in vehicles, after 24 people were killed in UP’s Auraiya district when the truck they were travelling on met with an accident on Saturday morning . Sixteen people on the truck had boarded from an area under the jurisdiction of Indirapuram police station in Ghaziabad.On Sunday, most of the migrants trying to cross over were people who had been working in Delhi and were stranded there after the lockdown was announced. Almost all of them HT spoke to said that they now desperately wanted to get back to their hometowns.Ghaziabad police, however, said that they could not let migrants enter as they were on foot. Only those having valid train tickets will be allowed to enter.“We have not allowed them to walk on the highway and only those having valid train tickets will be allowed entry. We have also not allowed any vehicles carrying migrant workers into Ghaziabad. Any vehicle ferrying migrants is being stopped and workers are made to de-board. Such vehicles ,like trucks, will also face legal action,” said Anshu Jain, circle officer (Indirapuram).The migrants complained that they couldn’t make train reservations since many of them didn’t know how to do online booking.“We were made to sit at the border and not allowed to enter Ghaziabad, from where we hoped to get on to a bus or a train to our hometowns in Bihar. We don’t have any work in Delhi and we need to go home. We are not able to book train tickets online as many of us either don’t know how to do it or don’t have mobile phones to do it,” said Iftekhar, a migrant worker from Purnia in Bihar, who worked at Azad Market in Sadar Bazar area of Delhi.“There were people who even asked for Rs 3,000 to get our train tickets booked. We do not have so much money. So we decided to come to Ghaziabad and are now stranded at the border,” he added.Like Iftekhar, another man Tauseef , said he had been stuck ever since his small factory in Delhi’s Sadar Bazar, which made curtain rings, was shut down.“My factory has shut down and the only way we can survive is by going home. But we are now stuck at the border while hundreds of migrant workers like us have already moved to UP and are headed to their home towns. When we arrived here on Saturday afternoon by a bus, which was headed to Noida, the cops stopped the bus and made us de-board,” said Tauseef, who is native of Arariya in Bihar.“There were hundreds of migrant workers like us at the UP border, but walking alongside the (Hindon) canal area. We know that buses and trains are going from Ghaziabad but we are stranded here and have no means to book online tickets. We were stopped at the border, but food was provided to us,” he added.Later in the day, as hundreds of workers started pouring in towards the border, authorities took them to different shelter homes in Ghaziabad, from where their travel arrangements are being made.“The workers on the Delhi side were not allowed to enter and they were taken away by Delhi Police. Those on our side and those found walking on roads in Ghaziabad were taken to temporary shelter homes,” said Manish Mishra, superintendent of police (city).The UP government has given permission for the operation of Shramik Special trains from Ghaziabad and Noida and trains have been running from these stations since May 15.The Uttar Pradesh government officials on Sunday said that 522 trains have arrived from other states while another 87 will arrive soon.“Within next 2-3 days when these trains arrive, about 16.5 lakh migrant workers will arrive back home in UP. On Saturday, about 1.5 lakh workers arrived in UP,” said Awanish Awasthi, UP’s additional chief secretary (home).“We have also requested the Railways to allow short distance travel of about 200-300km, so that workers can travel between Ghaziabad and Bareilly and Ghaziabad and Mordabad. We have asked the Railways for permission of running Mainline Electric Multiple Unit (MEMU) or EMU trains to ferry workers,” he added.The administration officials on Sunday night said in a statement that there is a proposal of running three trains, which will leave Ghaziabad everyday for cities of Gorakhpur (via Lucknow, Barabanki, Gonda, Basti and Khlilabad), Varanasi (via Lucknow, Fatehpur and Prayagraj) and Azamgarh (via Lucknow, Barabanki, Faizabad, Akbarpur, Shahganj and Sarai Mir).The train services are free of cost for migrant workers, but they have to register online and wait for an SMS which is sent by the state government that serves as their ticket.Apart from the trains, UP roadways is also plying buses to different districts of the state. The UP Roadways till Saturday evening had sent about 600 buses to different areas from Morta in Ghaziabad, with an average seating capacity of 35 passengers.The bus services have been operational for migrant workers for past one week and will continue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hundreds-of-migrants-on-foot-stopped-at-delhi-ghaziabad-border-taken-to-shelter-homes/story-hxZafM7kt9z2capRH0x4mM.html
17-05-2020||Chandigarh||Farmers in Patiala villages ignore PAU advisory, start direct sowing of paddy||Farmers in Patiala district’s villages of Kallarmajri, Thuhi and many others have started sowing paddy, using the direct seeding rice (DSR) methodology, ignoring Punjab Agricultural University (PAU’s) advise of doing so only from June 1. Most of them lack the specialised equipment to do so, and claim that they are doing this early, apprehending labour shortage.Normal sowing of paddy is allowed to start from May 10 and transplantation can be started from June 10. These are both 10 days earlier from previous years.Farmers in some villages also claim to be modifying wheat seed drills to sow paddy. In Thuhi village, a Super Seeder, used for wheat, has been used for direct sowing of paddy. Farmers in the region have uploaded several videos of themselves on YouTube, while they undertake such changes from traditional agricultural practices.Government officials, however, are not impressed and added that this technique entailed the problem of higher weed growth. The use of weedicides, in proper quantity and at the correct time, was critical with this technique, they added.“PAU has advised June 1 as the date to start paddy direct seeding, as it also takes into account climatic conditions. Farmers should follow it. Farmers have also been advised to use it on only 20% of their field size, as it is new,” said SS Walia, Patiala chief agricultural officer, adding, “There are no instructions to forcibly stop farmers from direct sowing before advised date.”He added, “On being advised, farmers tell us that they will plough the field and replant paddy using the old technique, if they do not see favourable results by June 1st week.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/farmers-in-patiala-villages-ignore-pau-advisory-start-direct-sowing-of-paddy/story-hLMOL0GOIqLyinMC1yFKnK.html

They said the water entered the village around 4am. Even as they tried to plug the breach, they could not stop the flow of water.They claimed that while some pigs died in a farm outside the village, water destroyed wheat fodder as well. “Around 3.30am, my mother woke me up and I heard people screaming as they found their houses inundated,” said Balinder Singh, a local. Nishant Kumar Yadav, deputy commissioner of Karnal, reached the village and issued directions to plug the breach. He said, “The water entered only one village, but it later submerged some fields. It was, however, diverted to the Yamuna through a drain near the village.”The DC said there wasn’t any report of loss of life and the cattle were safe. The administration has pressed roadways buses and divers into service for evacuation, if required, he added. DC Yadav said the flow of water was stopped at Yamunanagar, but it will take some hours to reduce its level. About the cause of breach, he said the reason could not be ascertained yet, but in the initial findings it was revealed that it was due to weak lining of the canal.Local MLA Harvinder Kalyan also reached the village and assured all support to the villagers from the government. He said the water was being diverted to the empty fields and officials were working to seal the breach. However, locals accused the government and administration of not taking the required measures to repair the banks of canal and claimed that the water was flowing above the canal capacity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/breach-in-canal-floods-karnal-s-ranwar-village/story-ehNHrJ3yJrDjMlS49HPC0I.html

The incident was reported around 11.30am when a passerby called the police helpline (112) about the body. The body has been sent for an autopsy and the case is being investigated, the Sector 49 police said.“It was a baby boy barely a few days old. There are no external injury marks on the body and it has been sent for an autopsy,” said Dharmendra Kumar Sharma, station house officer (SHO), Sector 49 police station.Prima facie it appears that the child died due to drowning, but the exact cause of death will be ascertained only after the autopsy report comes in, the police said.“The drain begins at Sector 62 and somebody must have dumped the child in it at any point after which it floated down to where it was found. We are investigating the case and all angles are being looked into,” said Sharma.According to the officials, cops suspect that an unwed mother might have thrown the baby into the drain.The SHO also said that legal action will be taken once the autopsy report comes in.The police said that a case will be registered after the responsible party is apprehended, and if the need arises a suo motu cognizance of the matter may also be taken.On the evening of April 28, the Noida police had found an abandoned newborn girl child at the Parthla roundabout after which she had been sent to the adoption centre in Mathura.

Even vegetable vendors were not allowed, they said. They even held a protest in the village raising slogans against the administration on Thursday.All 46 patients from the village have been discharged. In its 200-year-old history, the village has never borne such a brunt before where a virus has made it a no-go zone. The number of positive cases in the village account for 45% of the total 105 cases in the district. On April 4, the village was declared a hotspots and containment zone and it was sealed. The administration had claimed that they would be providing food and ration at the doorsteps of the residents. A resident, Gurpreet Singh, said, “It has become difficult to even get medicines and most of the time, we get it after a gap of four days. For the first time we have seen such restrictions in our village.”When contacted, sub-divisional magistrate of Dera Bassi Kuldeep Bawa said the allegations were false. “We have the list of the residents of the entire village and have provided them everything. Only issue is they want to step out of the village and we cannot allow this.”The village located on the Ambala- Chandigarh highway has a population of around 3,000. With a special police force called Covid Commandos assisting health officials, sample testing continues to take place here.One of the first persons to test positive on April 4 here was Malkit Singh and his cousin, the village sarpanch, who reportedly defied curfew norms to organise community meals and interact with the locals, because of which 46 villagers were infected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/after-being-sealed-in-for-45-days-residents-of-jawaharpur-village-in-mohali-beseech-administration-to-be-let-out/story-J5HU30G8wRdXdrOJPmdUvK.html

17-05-2020||Chandigarh||Parole, bail of 30% prisoners in Chandigarh’s Model Jail extended||Undertrials and convicts at Chandigarh’s Burail Model Jail granted special bail or parole between March 27 to May 9 due to the Covid-19 outbreak have been given an extension by the state legal services authority (SLSA), it has been learnt.The decision was taken at an SLSA meeting on Sunday between Justice Jaswant Singh of the Punjab and Haryana high court with inspector general of prisons Ombir Singh and home secretary Arun Kumar Gupta.Interim bail and parole of prisoners released from March 27 to April 25 will be extended by five weeks (35 days) and for others freed from April 26 to May 9 by three weeks (21 days). However, those released after May 10 will be given no extension.The prisoners’ return will be staggered to prevent undue crowding of the prison with only 20 undertrials/convicts taken back at one time. They will then be sent to isolation wards. The decision to release undertrials was taken to decongest the prison during the Covid-19 lockdown.“The prisoners released on special bail for a period of 60 days will be due to return shortly. In the prevailing Covid-19 situation, readmitting prisoners has enormous risk and will defeat the whole purpose of releasing them” observed the committee.Special lok adalatThe superintendent of police at Burail has also been asked to inform the SLSA about undertrails committing petty offences within one week, which will then hold a lok adalat to dispose of cases, reportedly exercising leniency.Since March 27, in three special lok adalats, 147 cases were taken up, in which the release of 104 prisoners was ordered but 72 were actually let off.Besides this, at least 42 prisoners were released after furnishing personal bonds.Convicted prisonersUp till May 15, jail authorities processed 332 parole applications, of which 229 prisoners were released and only 174 granted special parole. About 55 persons were not released for want of sureties and applications of 56 were rejected. The committee decided that convicts who had already availed one parole/furlough peacefully and surrendered on time at the jail gate could be granted a onetime six-week special parole, on the same set of sureties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/parole-bail-of-30-prisoners-in-chandigarh-s-model-jail-extended/story-Zthouj4E9gkCGRjgnMl6sM.html

The district administration has recently decided to close the quarantine facility at the hospital, and to develop it into a dedicated Covid-19 hospital. However, the matter was resolved in a few hours after the district administration, taking cognizance of the agitation, constituted a two-member probe committee, including Gautam Budh Nagar chief development officer (CDO) Anil Kumar Singh and additional chief medical officer Dr Amit Vikram, to look into the matter and immediately redress their demands.“Things have been sorted out. They are happy and willing to work again,” said the CDO. When contacted, the agitators also said that their dues have been cleared. “We were left with no option but to stage a protest as our demands would fall on deaf ears of the hospital administration. We have got our pending payments today and don’t have any grievance now,” said a demonstrator, preferring anonymity.Singh said that after the decision of making the district hospital a dedicated Covid-19 hospital, these employees had doubts that they would not get their pending salaries. “After this matter came into the cognizance of the administration, I personally met them and asked the reason behind the agitation. They said that they were apprehensive about their payments, and had no option other than to demonstrate to catch the attention of higher authorities,” he said.Singh said that the administration has made immediate payments of the pending amounts to the demonstrators.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/district-admin-clears-dues-of-women-employees-at-quarantine-centre-after-protest/story-bCf6uZzKtfVDgGrZAwlYFL.html

It had already started eliminating the use of plastic tokens in January and replaced it with paper QR tickets. “We will encourage commuters to use the mobile application and smart cards more to limit contact. There will be limited usage of paper tickets too,” said a source in the know.He added that alternate seats in the coaches that have to be left unoccupied will be marked, entries will be restricted with only a few gates open and thermal scanners and sanitisers will be provided at the entry to the station.Around 4.5 lakh commuters travel via the 11.5-km corridor.Meanwhile, the Mumbai Monorail, which relies mainly on plastic tokens for ticketing, is also developing a mobile application for ticketing. “We have a backup system of paper tickets but we will do away with tokens,” said an official who did not wish to be named. The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), which runs the Monorail, is also planning to develop a common mobility application which will allow commuters to plan and pay for trips across all transport modes.Several mobility organisations are also suggesting measures so that public transport can resume even as cities fight the pandemic. ITDP India Programme, in its report, for transport undertakings dealing with bus operations have suggested several measures which include only allowing commuters wearing masks, conductors ensuring queue during boarding and alighting buses and contactless ticketing options and digital payments.“Covid-19 provides Indian cities with an opportunity to transform their public transport services by improving user experience through technology, investing in public transport as a social good, reforming informal transit services, and promoting walking and cycling for shorter trips,” said Parin Visariya, senior urban development associate at ITDP India Programme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-metro-says-no-plastic-token-to-curb-covid-19-spread/story-WNBbWfiMrwaRgVJr7XDfcL.html

17-05-2020||Chandigarh||Public transport to be back on track in Chandigarh||After nearly two months of remaining off road, public transport in Chandigarh is all set to be back on track.With the central government issuing fresh guidelines for the lockdown 4.0 post May 17, the UT administration is planning to resume public transport, allow interstate movement of vehicles and persons without passes and opening of Sector 17 and Madhya Marg markets among other relaxations in the city.The final decision on relaxations will be taken in a meeting to be presided over by UT administrator VPS Badnore on Monday.The city was placed under lockdown on the midnight of May 3, after the curfew imposed since March 24 was lifted. A number of relaxations were also allowed between 7am and 7pm.Manoj Kumar Parida, UT adviser, said, “As per the central government guidelines, we are considering to resume local and interstate bus services. Apart from this, a decision will also be taken on whether to open Madhya Marg and Sector 17 markets besides other congested ones in Sectors 19 and 22. Chandigarh is a union territory, and directions of the ministry of home affairs will be followed. The final decision will be taken by the UT administrator on Monday. Status quo will continue till formal orders are issued by the administration.”Manoj Kumar Parida, UT adviserDiscussion will also be held on whether to continue with odd-even formula for opening shops in inner sector markets.On Sunday, the Centre allowed interstate transport in public and private vehicles in the fourth phase of lockdown, with mutual consent of states and UTs. The public transport will be opened with partial capacity, as only 50% of the seats will be allowed to be used. Decision on red zone tooWith the Centre empowering states and UTs to delineate red, orange and green zones, the UT administration will also be deciding on the red zone designation for the city. As many as 191 Covid-19 cases have been reported in the city till Sunday evening with no fresh case reported for the last four days.“Majority of the cases are from six containment zones, and there has been no fresh case for the last four days. The administrator will take the final decision on whether to keep the entire city under red zone or only limited areas,” said a senior UT official, who didn’t want to be named.The city, designated as a red zone on April 15, has six containment zones. Within these containment zones, only essential activities will be allowed. There will be strict perimeter control to ensure that there is no movement of people in or out of these zones, except for medical emergencies and for maintaining supply of essential goods and services.LOCKDOWN 4.0 IN CHANDIGARHNight curfew will continue to remain in force on the movement of individuals, for all non-essential activities, between 7pm and 7amWHAT WILL REMAIN CLOSEDAll domestic and international air travel of passengersSchools, colleges, educational/training/coaching institutionsHotels, restaurants a, bars and other hospitality servicesCinema halls, shopping malls, gymnasiums, swimming pools, entertainment parks, theatres, auditoriums, assembly hallsAll social, political, sports, entertainment, academic, cultural, religious functions, other gatherings and large congregationsAll religious places, places of worshipWHAT’S LIKELY TO OPENAs per the central government’s directions, all other activities will be permitted except those specifically prohibited under the guidelinesLocal and interstate bus serviceIntercity movement of people and vehicles without passesMarkets on sector-dividing roads and Sector 17E-commerce activities for non-essential goodsRestaurants permitted to operate kitchens for home delivery of food itemsSports complexes and stadiums, without spectatorsCycle rickshaws, auto rickshaws, taxis and cab aggregatorsBarber shops, spas and salons||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/public-transport-to-be-back-on-track-in-chandigarh/story-O7aFffZf9YYED3UJcosoTK.html
17-05-2020||Mumbai||In less than a year, 59 fishermen awarded ₹11.9L for rescuing protected marine animals||In less than a year, the Maharashtra fishing community has rescued 64 protected and endangered marine mammals caught in their fishing nets. The state mangrove cell on Sunday said 59 fishermen were compensated with ₹11,94,350 for the safe release of these marine species over the past 10 months. Within the last seven days, 19 fishers were compensated with an amount of ₹3,65,000 across Thane, Raigad and Palghar.The compensation scheme for the conservation practice was launched by the mangrove cell and fisheries department on December 21, 2018, and was subsequently passed by the state Cabinet. Endangered marine animals, protected under various schedules of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, get caught in large trawler fishing nets and are rescued by cutting these fishnets. However, while the animals survive once the nets are cut, the fishing community endures a loss due to damaged nets. Hence, for such rescues a monetary compensation of up to ₹25,000 was proposed if the fisher can submit evidence of the rescue and damaged nets to the state. “Through several awareness drives and local outreach programmes, we managed to convince 1,100 members of the fishing community along the Konkan coast about the value of endangered marine species. The efforts have resulted in mutual benefit of marine life and the community,” said Virendra Tiwari, additional principal chief conservator of forest (mangrove cell).So far, 27 olive ridley turtles, 17 whale sharks, 16 green sea turtles, one case each for hawksbill turtle, leatherback turtle, Indian Ocean humpback dolphin and giant guitar fish, all majorly Schedule I species under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, have been rescued. While maximum cases have been reported from Thane district (23), Sindhudurg reported 16 cases, Raigad 13, Palghar 9, Ratnagiri 2, and one case in Mumbai.“Of the total of 64 cases reported so far, five fishermen are yet to be compensated as we are still verifying the evidence,” said Tiwari. “Our researchers are also benefitting from this scheme as the fishing community has been sharing vital information about habitat preferences and occurrences of rare marine life along the state’s coastline. We are planning detailed conservation studies across such zones.”The state’s coastline had witnessed a surge in marine mammal deaths and stranding incidents (143 cases) between 2016 and 2019. However, the frequency of such cases has reduced over the past year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/in-less-than-a-year-59-fishermen-awarded-11-9l-for-rescuing-protected-marine-animals/story-W7UDDDsuIjFDPLexdzNtKI.html

On Sunday too, until 2pm, 14 cases had been reported from the two jails.Health minister Raghu Sharma said the department had started random sampling in jails to prevent the spread of the infection.“We are also trying to find out how the virus got into the jails,” he said. Sharma said a Covid care centre has been set up in Jaipur district jail as isolation facility for positive cases. “We are shifting only positive cases with co-morbidities to outside hospitals,” he said.The Rajasthan high court had earlier taken suo motu cognizance of the Covid-19 outbreak in jails and ordered the state government to form committees in every district comprising secretary of district legal services authority, chief medical and health officer and president or secretary of district bar association to check if jails were following government’s guidelines on prevention of infection.It said the committees will visit the jails and submit their report to Rajasthan State Legal Services Authority, which, in turn, will collate all district reports and present them in the high court.Rajasthan has been reporting more than 200 new cases of Covid-19 every day since May 13. The number was 202 on May 13, 206 on May 14, and 213 each on May 15 and 16.Rajasthan’s tally crossed the 5,000 mark on Sunday morning before ending day at 5,202, which includes 61 Iran evacuees and 49 of Border Security Force (BSF) personnel.Out of the 5,202 cases, 3,055 have recovered and 2,655 of them even sent home. The number of active cases in the state is 2,016.Five deaths were also reported in the state on Sunday – two from Jaipur and one each from Bharatpur, Bikaner and Kota.Rajasthan has so far tested 231,946 samples, out of which 221,764 tested negative and 5,103 are under process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/rajasthan-records-highest-single-day-spike-of-242-covid-19-cases/story-7AgqjNH90cxMLgUrw1sDiJ.html
17-05-2020||Mumbai||Sudden spike in air pollution, may worsen further: SAFAR||The city’s air quality deteriorated on Sunday with a sudden spike in pollutant measuring indicator. Air quality index (AQI) for PM2.5 — breathable particulate matter of 2.5 microns or less in size — increased from 55 on Saturday to 90 on Sunday, both falling under the ‘satisfactory’ category. AQI for PM10 (larger coarser particles) shot up from 62 to 96 during the same time, according to the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR). City’s AQI levels had not crossed 65 from April 8 to May 16.SAFAR categorises AQI for pollutants in the 0-50 range as good; 51-100 as satisfactory; 101-200 as moderate; 201-300 as poor; 301-400 as very poor and above 400 as severe.“A moderate dust storm that originated in Afghanistan is beginning to sweep past Rajasthan and western parts of India. We expect pollution levels to rise, especially for PM10, over the next two to three days unless these areas receive rainfall,” said Gufran Beig, director, SAFAR.Researchers said pollution levels are expected to increase further on Monday with AQI for PM2.5 likely to be 121 and for PM10 105, both falling in the ‘moderate’ category.Among the 10 monitoring stations in the city, Andheri had the worst air at 188 for PM2.5, followed by Bhandup at 139 and Colaba at 115, all under the ‘moderate’ category. The concentration for PM10 was 138 micrograms per cubic metre (μg/m³) against the safe limit of 100 μg/m³ for 24 hours. PM2.5 levels were 60 μg/m³, which was at the 24-hour safe limit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sudden-spike-in-air-pollution-may-worsen-further-safar/story-SXdCgNmtnOQ5IdP1vhzYEI.html
17-05-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh administration to set up appointment system for buying alcohol||Want do enjoy a quiet drink at home in the evening, need to replenish your alcohol stock and don’t want to queue up for bottles of wine or whiskey in the May heat? Well, soon you will be able to book an appointment online with a liquor vend, get a token, and go pick up your bottle(s) at a specified time.The move comes after crowds thronged vends, serpentine queues formed and people forgot social distancing rules in their eagerness to get their hands on alcohol on May 4 after 40 “dry” days of lockdown due to Covid-19 restrictions.An appointment system, the administration hopes, will keep away the crowds.It will allow people to book an appointment online, get a token and reach the vend at a specified time to pick up alcohol.Dates to start the facility are yet to be fixed.“Dedicated mobile and web based applications have been developed with the help of National Informatics Centre, Chandigarh. A buyer will have to register on it, book his purchase and get an electronic token to show at the time of purchase,” said a senior UT official privy to the development.A fixed number of about 40 tokens will be issued in an hour even though the exact number is yet to be fixed.The application and the website for getting the e-token is likely to be known as ‘liquor e-token’. Buyers will have to register online and share details like name, address, mobile number and age.Currently, around 66 liquor vends are operational in the city under the excise policy of 2019-2020, which has been extended till June 30. On Saturday, the department announced that the licence fee will be paid in terms of pro-rata basis.An excise department notification read that the fee already paid by the retail sale licensees for March 23 to March 31 when they could not run their vends due to the lockdown and curfew would be adjusted in the licence fee to be paid for the extended period. People who have not applied for extension/renewal of licences and those not getting licences extended/renewed for the extended period will have their licence fee refunded for the March 23 to 31 period.Also, cow cess will be levied at the rate of Rs 5 per bottle of 750ml of country liquor, Rs 5 per bottle of 650ml of beer and Rs 10 per bottle of 750ml of whiskey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-administration-to-set-up-appointment-system-for-buying-alcohol/story-06ScIUXyDctc1s6WzWxQHK.html
17-05-2020||Mumbai||State wildlife board hasn’t met since December 2018||Key development projects, wildlife mitigation measures and crucial decisions on translocation of big cats have been put on hold since the State Board for Wildlife (SBWL) has not met since December 2018. What’s worse is that the wildlife body, chaired by the chief minister, has not been reconstituted since the Uddhav Thackeray government came to power in November 2019.The details were revealed after the state chief wildlife warden recently wrote to the Maharashtra government about the defunct SBWL requesting for an immediate reconstitution of the board. “Unless it is reconstituted, only official members will remain part of the board, and the board cannot function if non-official or non-government members are not present,” said Nitin Kakodkar, principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife), Maharashtra. “A communication has been sent to the state about this. SBWL does not only issue clearances for projects but it is also the recommending body for notification of new protected areas, decisions on major research projects in wildlife zones, and is crucial in allowing translocation of big cats.”When major linear infrastructure or irrigation project proposals are placed before SBWL, the body orders site inspection first. The inspection report is then tabled before SBWL, following which the said proposals can be recommended and sent to the standing committee of the National Board for Wildlife (NBWL) under the Union environment ministry, said another SBWL member.Final recommendations on projects including the Mumbai-Ahmedabad Bullet train, wildlife mitigation measures for Mumbai-Nagpur expressway (Maharashtra Samruddhi Mahamarg), 126-km Virar-Alibag multi-modal corridor, Railways’ dedicated Delhi-Mumbai freight corridor, Goregaon-Mulund tunnel passing through boundaries of Sanjay Gandhi National Park and Tungareshwar Wildlife Sanctuary, and two interstate irrigation projects between Maharashtra and Telangana — Pranahita Chevella Project and Chanaka-Korata Project, are pending, said Kishor Rithe, former SBWL member who was present during the last meeting on December 5, 2018. “SBWL is an important board for deciding policies regarding wildlife conservation and management. It also deals with several infrastructure projects that are likely to have negative impact on protected areas. So both the issues wildlife management and infrastructure projects get stuck if SBWL does not function. I hope the state will constitute the same soon,” said Rithe.Former member Anish Andheria said SBWL should meet at least once every six months. “There are many issues ranging from human-animal conflict, biodiversity protection and systematic reviews of conservation decision. Considering such problems are on the rise, SBWL is an integral body with powers to address these concerns. We request the state to expedite to take this up at the earliest,” he said.After repeated attempts to reach additional chief secretary (revenue and forests) Manu Kumar Srivastava, he did not comment. However, a senior state government official, requesting anonymity, said, “The Covid-19 pandemic has stalled the agenda of a number of subjects, and SBWL is one of them. Official members are all handling pandemic related problems. However, the final decision on this will be taken by the chief minister soon.”Meanwhile, various bodies of the Union environment ministry, including the standing committee of NBWL, have been meeting through video conferencing and taking calls on projects. During the first week of April, NBWL issued the final clearance for the ₹55,335-crore Mumbai-Nagpur super highway. “Overall, bodies that are supposed to ensure the protection of wildlife have made a mockery of their responsibilities,” said environmentalist Stalin D.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/state-wildlife-board-hasn-t-met-since-december-2018/story-kQjzTKYTuP7XohPDVLgZnJ.html

Senior police inspector from Kalwa police station, S Darekar, said, “We decided to celebrate his recovery. We joined the residents and showered him with flower petals. We performed aarti and gave him a bouquet. Some of the residents sang patriotic songs for him.”The 50-year-old constable was overwhelmed with the welcome. “It was a difficult time. Being strong is the only option during the quarantine period,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/recovered-cop-gets-a-warm-welcome/story-kyA9BEUfF3LdOQdhVvjR6K.html
17-05-2020||Mumbai||80% of stored blood used up; city stares at acute shortage||The city is on the verge of facing acute blood shortage as the current blood storage across blood banks is likely to suffice only ten days. This is a result of donors staying away from hospitals and blood banks in fear of contracting Covid-19.Mumbai generally requires 900 units of blood a day, but the number has dipped to 400 units a day since the outbreak of Covid-19 and the subsequent lockdown. Officials at the State Blood Transfusion Council (SBTC) said that almost 80% of stored blood across the 58 blood banks in the city has dried up. The shortage came to the fore last week when Nashik resident Suwarna Pawar, 25, had to wait for four days for a foetus blood transfusion at Wadia Maternity Hospital. The seven-month pregnant woman had rushed to the Parel-based hospital on Wednesday after the foetus was diagnosed with a rare-genetic disorder and immediately needed blood transfusion. However, the hospital didn’t have his blood group O- (negative).“My blood group is A- (negative) and my child is O- (negative). We kept searching for blood for four days. Finally, doctors transfused blood on Saturday. I thought I would lose the child,” said Pawar who is still undergoing treatment at the hospital. In another case, Sohini Mazumdar, 38, a patient of thalassemia — a blood disorder wherein the body produces less haemoglobin — struggled for four days to arrange one unit of blood. “I need blood transfusion every 15 days to survive since my body can’t produce enough blood. If I don’t get blood on time, I may even die. Arranging for blood is my monthly struggle, but the pandemic has made it worse,” said Mazumdar.While all elective surgeries have been put on hold for the moment, the blood shortage crisis is likely to worsen once the government allows surgeries. In view of the state government’s rule that mass gatherings at one place will not be permitted, all major blood donation camps between March and May have been cancelled. With no alternative in sight, SBTC is planning to organise micro-blood camps in housing societies by adhering to physical distancing measures.“At present, we have a stock of around 10 days. Sometimes, willing donors who want to donate get stopped by police. Though demand for blood in accident cases has decreased owing to the lockdown, patients suffering from cancer, thalassemia and haemophilia are facing a lot of trouble,” said Dr Arun Thorat, in-charge of SBTC, Maharashtra. Two days before the nationwide lockdown was imposed on March 25, Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope had appealed to citizens to donate blood in light of a shortage of blood. Blood Donors India, which works with the Union health ministry, said people’s response on social media platforms has decreased by almost 40%. “The crisis is not only in Mumbai but across the country. Earlier, we would get around 15-20 requests from the city, however, the response is far less now as people are scared to even go near hospitals,” said Balu Nayar, founder of the group. Another bottleneck is the lack of manpower to efficiently operate blood banks round the clock. “Many staffers who stay in far-off areas like Nalla Sopara or Virar are not coming to the hospital since the lockdown. As a result, there is not enough staff to arrange blood donation camps,” said a blood donation official from King Edward Memorial (KEM) Hospital, Parel.In view of the pandemic, it has also become harder for hospital administrations to reach out to patient’s relatives for blood. “If anyone wants to donate blood, they can call on the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) helpline number — 1916 — to get details about their nearest blood bank. All blood banks are given special instruction to main sanitation and physical distancing norms,” said Dr Thorat.With growing awareness about convalescent plasma therapy, people are seeking blood from people who have recovered from Covid-19. As HT reported earlier, convalescent plasma therapy involves injecting patients with blood plasma from recovered patients. In this process, the plasma with antibodies is transfused into an infected person to boost his immunity response to Sars-Cov-2, which causes Covid-19. In the last one month, Blood Donors India has received around 20 such demands from Mumbai. “Once, we get such requests, we tweet about the post and circulate it on social media platforms requesting recovered patients to come forward to donate their blood for plasma therapy,” said Balu Nayar, founder.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/80-of-stored-blood-used-up-city-stares-at-acute-shortage/story-oK1EOIZYt69ROyrELYcLKO.html
17-05-2020||Chandigarh||Former Union minister terms Centre’s stimulus package as merely ‘public relation exercise’||Former Union minister Pawan Kumar Bansal on Sunday termed the economic package announced under ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan (Self-reliant India Mission)’ scheme as merely a ‘public relation exercise’.Bansal, in a video press conference, said, “It is wrong to call the package a stimulus as it is only a mirage to mislead people.”“After remaining impassive to the sufferings of people for an inordinately long time and failing to alleviate distress of traders, industry workers, farmers, salaried-class employees and labourers, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on May 12 said that the government will provide a stimulus of ₹ 20 lakh crore to give a boost of self reliance to the economy, which had come to a complete halt due to the covid-19 pandemic. The hope generated to overcome despondency is however short-lived,” said Bansal.There is no immediate relief in the form cash assistance or exemptions to anyone, but only an intent to undertake some programmes in the future, he added.The former Union minister said that scheme without compensatory interest benefit or exemption to trade and industry and cash assistance to the economically poor people cannot be called a stimulus.“In the last four days, it seems that the announcements made by the finance minister lack sensitivity. Instead, it appears that the government is mocking at all sections of society,” added Bansal.Criticising the government for allowing foreign direct investment (FDI) in defence production, Bansal said, “In the name of stimulus and with the avowed objective of self-reliance, permitting more FDI in defence production and opening space exploration to private sector is tantamount to democracy giving way to oligarchy and rendering vulnerable critical security concerns of the country.”Advocating direct transfer of money to poor, Bansal said, “The government will have to spare ₹ 65,000 crore for it, which it hasn’t done as yet. At most, the so-called stimulus is of ₹ 3 lakh crore against the touted ₹ 20 lakh crore.”The National Food Security Act was enacted in 2013 to ensure ration to every Indian. However, as per the finance minister, 8 crore Indians including internal migrants are not covered under this system and are deprived of ration, he said, adding, “For the last two months, these people have not been given any ration.”He suggested that the government should borrow or even print more money, if it is required to help people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/former-union-minister-terms-centre-s-stimulus-package-as-merely-public-relation-exercise/story-pr8MkDZVEEJZcnkjAgdg2L.html
17-05-2020||Mumbai||Students want TISS to waive outstanding fees for the poor||Students at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), Mumbai, are demanding a waiver of outstanding fees for those belonging to marginal sections like scheduled caste (SC), scheduled tribe (ST), other backward classes (OBC) and economically weaker sections (EWS).For the graduating batch of 2018-20, the final date for paying the tuition fee, dining fee and hostel fee is May 31. However, owing to the Covid-19 pandemic that has affected the means of income of many families, the Progressive Students’ Forum (PSF) at TISS has claimed that students are not in a position to pay their outstanding fees. Students eligible for the Government of India Post-Matric Scholarship (GoI-PMS) have not received their scholarship fee from the central government, said PSF in a letter to the administration.The PSF has, therefore, demanded a complete waiver of outstanding fees of graduating students coming from SC, ST, OBC (NC) and EWS sections of the society. The forum has also sought a partial fee waiver of 50% for the students not falling under these categories but are unable to pay the money due to the lockdown. “No student should be levied a late fine because of the delay in reimbursement of scholarships,” the letter said.A source in the institute’s administration, however, indicated that any kind of waiver — partial or full — was not possible, given the institute’s financial health. The institute has been incurring deficits to the tune of Rs 9 crore annually, according to its annual reports. “The institute is doing its best to raise student aid to support students coming from marginal communities. We have raised over Rs 2.15 crore as student aids in 2019-20. Waiving off outstanding fees would mean waiving off around Rs 80 lakh, which is not feasible for the institute,” said the official.Last year, following protests over the fee issue, the institute had allowed final year students, particularly those from marginal communities, to pay their fees by May 2020 after their GoI-PMS funds had been disbursed, instead of the regular deadline of June 2019.“We will not be able to give any further extensions,” said the source. A final decision from the institute is awaited.Group condemned over webinar An independent student forum at the TISS campus, Democratic Secular Students’ Forum, has come under criticism for holding a webinar on “five things the youth must do to become an intellectual Kshatriya”. The student union of the institute has condemned the webinar and called it “an attempt to sabotage the anti-caste movement” on the campus. Asha Banu, dean student affairs at TISS, said that since the seminar was happening on social media, the institute administration had no jurisdiction over the same. “As long as they are not using the TISS campus or the logo, the administration has no jurisdiction over such activities,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/students-want-tiss-to-waive-outstanding-fees-for-the-poor/story-ceEJgcBlDyC1BC7HHsTnqN.html
17-05-2020||Mumbai||Balanced diet, breathing exercises and Yoga helped boost immunity: Cop who recovered from Covid-19||A sub-inspector, who recovered from Covid-19 on May 7, has come out with an awareness video on his recovery process, stressing on having a balanced diet, coupled with breathing exercises and Yoga. The policeman was posted at JJ Marg, one of the police stations worst-hit by the pandemic. Meanwhile, the Mumbai Police in western suburbs provided vaporisers to their personnel to clean their respiratory tracts and prevent them from getting infected. Over 538 police personnel in the city have been infected with Covid-19 and eight of them have died so far. Sub-inspector Sham Bise, who made the recovery video, had high fever on April 26 and tested positive on May 1. Two days later, his wife also tested positive but was asymptomatic. On May 7, he recovered from the disease at a Thane hospital. In the video he states, “There is nothing to fear. A strong diet and Yoga boosted my immunity. I had a high fever since April 29 and it came down only on May 7. I was admitted to Vedant Hospital in Thane. Every morning, I gargled with warm salty water. I had two eggs and jaggery mixed with nuts every day. I ate dry fruits like almond, cashew nuts and dates. Before sleeping at night, I used to drink hot milk with turmeric, followed by warm water. I used to start my day with Yoga exercises like Pranayam and Kapalbharti to increase my breathing capacity.”The total number of infected police personnel at JJ Marg station in south Mumbai till Sunday rose to 59, of which 10 have recovered. This includes 14 personnel from the State Reserve Police Force (SRPF). Sangramsinh Nishandar, deputy commissioner of police, zone 1 confirmed the development.Senior police officers in the western suburbs (Bandra to Jogeshwari) have distributed steam vaporisers to their personnel. The policemen have been asked to use them twice a day to keep their respiratory tracts clean. “It is a good initiative. But it is also important to take other safety measures like using PPE kits and maintaining social distancing,” said Dr SM Patil, police surgeon. Ankit Goyal, DCP, zone 10 said “In my zone, we gave vaporisers to almost everyone. Some of them were bought from additional commissioner of police’s (welfare) fund while others paid for it from their pocket.” Four police personnel, including an assistant commissioner of police (ACP) from Thane commissionerate, tested positive of Covid-19 on Sunday. The 38-year-old ACP was posted at the administration department of the Thane commissionerate headquarters. The other police personnel were a 32-year-old police officer and two constables, from Wagale Estate and Kopri police stations respectively. The ACP’s residential complex in Thane has been sealed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/balanced-diet-breathing-exercises-and-yoga-helped-boost-immunity-cop-who-recovered-from-covid-19/story-CZMh1Fy0YofHfBYzOsbtGL.html

17-05-2020||Mumbai||Indians stuck in Thailand seek government to operate more rescue flights||Hundreds of Indians stranded in Thailand, who are finding it difficult to survive, have appealed the central government to operate repatriate flights for those wanting to return to India, particularly Mumbai. The second phase of the Vande Bharat mission that commenced on Saturday has just one flight scheduled to fly between Bangkok and Delhi. No other flight has been scheduled to bring back Indians wanting to return to Mumbai, Kolkata, Kerala and Chennai. Speaking to these stranded Indians in Bangkok, HT learnt that most have exhausted their finances, hence have no money to pay for their hotel stay and have been asked by the Indian embassy to wait for a month to be able to fly back to Mumbai and other places.Vijay Kale, a marine engineer, couldn’t stop his tears while narrating his current situation. He said, “I am residing in a private room since the lockdown and I am not able to live here anymore due to exorbitant rents. Despite registering myself to be evacuated, I have not received any help. The embassy here is providing dry ration which is of no use to me as I am staying in a hotel room.The Indian embassy in Thailand, on April 7, had asked all the stranded Indians to register themselves so that they could be flown back in the repatriation flights. However, in the first phase of the Vande Bharat mission that commenced on April 8, no flight was scheduled between the two countries.In the second phase too, the only flight from Bangkok to India will be operated on May 20 between Bangkok and Delhi. Another stranded passenger, Rahul Mahajan, said, “My friend and I used to work here, but because of the current situation, we got laid off by the company. My wife is pregnant and is expected to deliver by June 10. She is alone in Pune. I request the government to operate flights back to India.”A Kerala-based senior citizen too appealed to the government to operate flights and help them urgently. Jigishaben Shah, a tour operator from Gujarat, said, “I had come here on February 17 and was to return on March 29, but now I have started selling my ornaments to pay rent.”Kishorraje Nimbalkar, secretary, relief and rehabilitation, said, “I am not aware of any such demand for the permission that has come to us. Generally calls in such cases are taken by the ministry of external affairs.”A response from MEA was still awaited at the time of going to the press.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/indians-stuck-in-thailand-seek-government-to-operate-more-repatriate-flights/story-UGwaxV0bYnrhrIXio3dhsK.html
17-05-2020||Chandigarh||After 65% jump in IT investments last fiscal, Covid-19 may hit growth in Punjab this year||Before the coronavirus pandemic led to a nationwide lockdown and brought business activity to a grinding halt two months ago, Punjab saw a 65% jump in investments in the information technology (IT) and IT-enabled services (ITeS) in the financial year 2019-20.The state received investments worth Rs 605 crore in the sector in the year gone by as compared to Rs 365 crore during 2018-19. Sweden-based Target EveryOne IT Private Limited, Aeren IT Solutions, Vertex Infosoft Solutions, Mark Software Systems, Entella Private Limited, Miran Informatics and EON Infotech are among the firms, including some start-ups, that have set up their software development units and IT services facilities in the state.Invest Punjab chief executive officer Rajat Agarwal said the bulk of the fresh investment, which is estimated to generate 4,600 additional jobs for IT professionals, has been made in the Sahibzada Ajit Singh Nagar district (earlier known as Mohali). “Aggressive policy advocacy and proactive follow up with the investors helped. Also, special incentives have been given over and above the non-thrust sectors to IT, ITeS, and Electronics System Design and Manufacturing (ESDM) industry to promote this sector,” he said. While several of these IT companies have already started their operations, others are expected to come on stream soon. The investments in the IT sector have grown 400% in the past two years, going up from Rs 121.49 crore in 2017-18 to Rs 605 crore last year. Though the IT sector, particularly software service providers, has shown tremendous resilience in the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak, the outlook for growth and investments in the current year does not appear to be encouraging.Crisil, a domestic rating agency, recently said the sector is staring at revenue growth sliding to a decadal low of up to 2% and narrowing margins due to the global pandemic. “The companies will lose out on new deals which will compromise future revenues,” the agency said in a report. An IT solutions firm based out of SAS Nagar, which also has operations in the USA and Europe, is already feeling the impact as its negotiations that were at an advanced stage with two big prospective overseas clients have gone into cold storage now.IT sector experts say there are many variables because no one knows for how long the lockdown will continue. “Then, things will also depend on the global scenario, how overseas clients are doing, and the cash flow situation,” they say. A large number of customers of IT services companies in the state are in the USA and Europe, which are among the most-affected regions.However, these companies, particularly software service providers, have made a quick transition to remote working to serve their existing clients that include some of the biggest names in the airline, banking, insurance, and other businesses. Software Technology Parks of India (STPI), Mohali, additional director Ajay Prasad Shrivastava said there has not been much impact on IT and ITeS sector in the region so far because the companies were quick to adapt to work from home to curtail the spread of coronavirus. “Also, there are not many hardware companies in the region. But how things pan out from here for different IT services firms will depend on the sectors in which they operate,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/after-65-jump-in-it-investments-last-fiscal-covid-19-may-hit-growth-in-punjab-this-year/story-HaS5LWKRHsClzgeFS7G42H.html

Karwal has lodged a complaint with commissioner of police Rakesh Agrawal in this regard.Karwal said the call from an unknown number appeared to be from some foreign country. The caller claimed he was a gangster and his name was Ladla. “The caller asked me in a threatening tone, ‘Tera Bains naal ki rola hai’ (What is the controversy between you and Bains,” he said, and added that he told the caller it would be better if he asked Bains about it instead of him.“The caller again threatened me saying ‘jyada syana na bann’ (don’t try to be over smart). I also replied in the same tone and asked him to be in his limits,” Karwal added. He said after 33 seconds, the caller disconnected the call and never called again.Karwal said, “I know Bains well and he cannot indulge in such cheap tactics. It could be someone of his family members, a follower or a sympathiser behind the call, but if he (Bains) did this, I want to tell him that I don’t care about such threats.”Despite repeated attempts, Bains was not contacted as his mobile phone was found switched off. Friends-turned-foes Karwal and Bains are on a war of words since they have parted their ways.

In a press conference in Jalandhar, the former hockey Olympian said the CLP meeting was the need of the hour to identify the government’s shortcomings and address them since the MLAs will have to face the people in the 2022 assembly polls. “We will have to tell people as what actions were taken by the government with regards to our core pre-poll issues like power purchase agreement (PPA), Bargari sacrilege, mining and other mafia. “These issues can’t be suppressed under the Covid-19 crisis which will stay here. People gave full mandate to the Congress and now we have to tell them what is stopping us from take pro-public decisions,” the MLA added. “We had promised to create a liquor corporation on the lines of states like Tamil Naidu which would help the state government earn revenue up to ₹30,000 crore. “Who stopped us from creating the corporation even as former minister Navjot Singh Sidhu took the matter in the cabinet meeting?” Pargat quesstioned.He also questioned as why Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal was silent at a time when the central government was snatching the rights of the states by centralising everything. “The Akali Dal always stood for more rights to states but now they are silent due to their vested interests,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/cong-mla-pargat-demands-clp-meet-to-review-capt-govt-s-3-year-performance/story-TSh26Buz5xUGzn9L2oUuVK.html

His family had installed a chair outside the tin containment seal right outside the lane where their house is located. However, the 108 ambulance failed to arrive even after repeated phone calls, according to family members. The ambulance service is run by the state government of Maharashtra and is managed by the BVG group, a private company.“We have issued notices to three authorities and sought a detailed response on why did the ambulance not report. Action will be taken based on their response,” said PMC Commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad.According to Dr Dnyaneshwar Shelke of BVG’s Emergency Medical Service (EMS) they have not received any show-cause notice. “I am hearing this information form you (HT),” he said.“A person named Sofian had called and he said that the person is dead. As per protocol of 108, the ambulance was not dispatched as they wanted a hearse and the doctor told them that 108 does not provide hearses,” said Dr Shelke.“The second call was from a police officer and he said there was an unknown unconscious person. The ambulance reached the location thinking it is a separate patient. The location of the ambulance is on record. They called the police, but could not connect or find them. The ambulance stayed there for some time before returning,” said Dr Shelke.“We are serving patients all over the state. So far we have served 71,000 corona patients - either suspected or positive. Why will we refuse service?” he added.Havaldar Deepak Tatey and Hawaldar Dhanaji Gophane of Samarth police station were with the family till the end and finally stopped a vehicle carrier tempo which took Francis to Sassoon General Hospital around 4 am on Friday.“We have called for call recording from 108 service. We are checking there was misinformation from either of the sides. Once we have the recordings from the ambulance service, we will ask the police what had happened,” said Nitin Udas, deputy commissioner, PMC.The PMC officials have, however, not contacted the family.“Some news was published that the police had not helped us. So the only visit we got was from the police asking us why we had said so. We assured them that we had not said anything of that sort,” said Shobha Francis, wife of the deceased man.The family is reeling from the loss and are worried about the financial future that awaits them post the pandemic is over.The family now comprises of two sisters of the deceased man, his wife and his son, Max Francis, 23, who works as an office boy at a local private company.“First the police came, then we went to the cemetery to mark the third day since his death. And now we are sitting at home,” said Shobha.The police have also agreed that the ambulance service had caused the delay and had a history of such instances in the past two months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delay-in-ambulance-service-pmc-serves-show-cause-notice-to-pmc-officials-bvg-manager/story-wWZY8gMbOdRDkiYBWRgD0O.html

With this and the resultant migration, many schools might see poor enrolments even after they start operations post-lockdown. If teachers are considered “surplus” based on this, it would be unfair. We have asked the government to stay the system for the academic year 2020-21,” said Anil Bornare, coordinator for BJP teachers cell. While several deputy directorates in the state have also written to the education department requesting that teachers in red zones be exempted from the rule for a year, an official from the department said that an official decision was yet to be taken.As per the norms of the department, if a school has more teachers than the student-teacher ratio of 30:1 per class, appointments of such surplus teachers are cancelled and they are transferred to other schools with vacancies. The department is currently providing online learning material to students and is meanwhile coming up with possible plans for reopening after the lockdown is lifted. It is likely that each region would have different reopening schedules depending on the situation at the local level.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/don-t-transfer-surplus-teachers-in-red-zones-teachers-body/story-7SDXHB2jn2JGR2Q8XHwGYJ.html

17-05-2020||Chandigarh||In Covid battle, Punjab ITI girl students sewing masks for frontline warriors, needy||Shiv Kumari, 18, a student at Industrial Training Institute (ITI Women), Ghumar Mandi, in Ludhiana has sewed around 2,500 masks in a little over past one month for the frontline warriors battling the Covid-19 pandemic and those living in slum areas. She is among over 4,600 girl students of 78 ITIs in the state who have made more than 10 lakh four-layered washable masks from their homes during this period. The state directorate of technical education and industrial training is arranging for the raw material either through the administration or with contributions by the ITI staff, residents, NGOs and industrialists. The masks are provided to the district administrations, healthcare workers, municipal corporation employees, police, asha and anganwadi workers, panchayats, farmers, migrant labourers.“I learned to make mask from my institute teacher. Also, my father motivated me to contribute for the social cause. Initially, I was able to make 30-40 masks daily but now I can fabricate more than 80 in a day,” says Kumari who is pursuing embroidery course at the institute. Beant Kaur, a student at ITI (Women), Jagraon, says, “I decided to make masks after I was encouraged by the teachers and principal of the ITI.”Mother of two joins the causeCharanjeet Kaur, a first-year student of ITI, Bathinda, devotes about four hours a day at her one-room house at Harbans Nagar locality for stitching masks. The cloth to make masks is being provided by State Bank of India officials for free distributions.A mother of two school-going children, she is among 35 ITI students from the district who have made about 20,000 masks.“During the lockdown, our ITI instructor Jaswinder Kaur held online classes on mask-making. I also learnt about sewing masks from YouTube videos,” says Charanjeet.Sakshi Taak, a former student of the institute, is assisted by her mother, sister and neighbours in making of masks.Sakshi’s father is an employee at the local ITI and their colony community started with making masks for themselves.“As most of the women in our colony are expert in sewing, they pooled money and started distributing the masks to vegetable vendors. Then, officials of SBI and some NGOs approached the ITI faculty members for making masks as a community service,” she adds.‘Teachers available on phone to help us’Neha, a student of Government Institute of Garments Technology (GIGT), Amritsar, says, “We did not have experience of mask-making. Our teachers first made a video of how to make a mask and shared it to us through WhatsApp. They remain available on phone to attend to our queries.”“If I work for 4-5 hours, I make 30-40 quality masks in a day. We have met first target and in case need arises in future, we are ready to work for noble cause”, added Neha, a resident of Guru Nanak Pura locality.“Apart from stitching masks assigned by the institute, I also got opportunity to prepare same for the residents of my locality. For example, the local gurdwara management provided me fabric for making masks which were distributed to the needy in the area. I also used the fabric I had at home,” she adds.Institute principal Jatinder Singh, who played an active role in facilitating the students in the cause, says, “Around 100 girls from the institute have stitched 28,000 masks. Five staff members and two volunteers also made their contribution.”“The district administration provided us most of the cotton fabric for making the masks. We could not provide fabric to the students who live in distant villages, but we asked them to contribute at village level,” he added.Savita Bawa, an instructor, says, “Our principal provided us electric cutter to cut the fabric. We prepared bundles of fabric after cutting it at the institute. We delivered these bundles with thread and needles at the doorsteps of the students.”Additional director (directorate of technical education and industrial training) Daljit Kaur Sidhu, said, “For the first two weeks, over 2,200 ITI girl students stitched 2.23 lakh masks. Thereafter, the department motivated more students to contribute for the cause and deputed nodal officers in every district for better coordination. The preparation of masks by students was monitored regularly.” Work recognised nationallyTo appreciate the initiative taken up by the ITIs across India, the Union ministry for skill development and entrepreneurship held a video conference with principals and students of 28 ITIs recently. Of the 28 ITIs, six were from Punjab. The state department has recommended the names of six ITI principals (Patiala, Rajpura, Raiya, Amritsar, Moga and Mohali) for motivating the students to stitch masks. The department has also sent names of eight students who made maximum masks in the last 32 days to the ministry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/in-covid-battle-punjab-iti-girl-students-sewing-masks-for-frontline-warriors-needy/story-15mPM7pkoBbeD9OHPPJzmO.html
17-05-2020||Mumbai||BMC takes U-turn on Wankhede stadium quarantine facility||Three days after the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) had written a letter to the Maharashtra Cricket Association (MCA) asking them to handover Wankhede stadium for it to be converted into a Covid quarantine facility, the civic body has now clarified that it is not going to take over the stadium, saying that the open ground will not be useful for the purpose during the monsoon season.On Sunday, municipal commissioner IS Chahal said, “I am surprised by reading news about a quarantine facility centre at the stadium. We are not taking over the cricket stadium or any other open space because, in Mumbai, it sometimes rains continuously for a week. It will not be useful at all for the administration to take care of people there.”Considering the outbreak of the novel coronavirus in the city, on May 14, assistant commissioner of A ward, Chanda Jadhav, had written a letter to MCA asking them to hand over the stadium temporarily, under the guidelines issued by the BMC commissioner as per the Epidemic Act 1897. The letter further stated that the stadium will be used for emergency staff of BMC and also to quarantine asymptomatic Covid-19 patients.After news of the letter, several residents associations from Marine Drive and neighbouring areas opposed BMC’s move to set up a quarantine facility at Wankhede stadium. Raj Purohit, former Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) MLA from the area, wrote a letter to the BMC chief on Saturday and demanded that the civic body reconsider its decision to set up quarantine centre at the stadium. It was said that residents threatened to protest if BMC went ahead with its plan.BMC’s u-turn on the plan follows on the heels of a tweet by Shiv Sena leader and minister Aditya Thackeray which pointed out the challenges of Covid centres during monsoon.Thackeray’s tweet was in response to Sena leader Sanjay Raut’s tweet, supporting BMC’s move to take over Wankhede Stadium. Raut had suggested making a similar facility at nearby Brabourne stadium as well.Despite its claims about monsoon issues for facilities set up on open grounds, Chahal announced that an 800-bed facility set up at the MMRDA ground in Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC) will be operational from Monday and appointment of staff is underway.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-takes-u-turn-on-wankhede-stadium-quarantine-facility/story-NPFXLWFcPJDOxbfP16Qo8L.html

Deshmukh said that the entire fare is being borne by the state government, which has sent 2.92 lakh migrants in 224 trains to their respective states.Deshmukh, who spoke to a news agency on Sunday, said that the Union finance minister’s claim was surprising. “She has said that 85% of the burden of fare for trains carrying migrants to various states has been borne by the Central government. It is not true. After migrants were forced to bear the entire fare initially, Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray requested the Centre to bear the entire cost instead,” he said. “Since the Centre did not respond, the state government made provision of ₹55 crore from the chief minister’s contingency fund. We would not hesitate to allocate more if needed,” Deshmukh added.The home minister said that other states have been hesitant about accepting their citizens who are stuck in Maharashtra. It was only after the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar and Thackeray spoke to the chief ministers of West Bengal and Bihar, the trains carrying migrants to these states started plying. The second train to West Bengal departed on Sunday, against the need of at least 10 trains per day.“Besides the migrants sent via rail, we sent more than one lakh migrants in 11,500 state transport buses to various states. We will need 700-800 special Shramik trains to transport the remaining stranded migrants. We are ready to pay if the Indian Railways is ready to make the trains available. The slow response from other states is posing a hurdle. We have at least 20 lakh migrants eager to go to their home states, but we are getting permissions for only 10% of the trains required,” Deshmukh said.Additionally, the minister confirmed that the Centre has positively responded to Maharashtra government’s demand for deploying Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF) to assist the Maharashtra Police which has been burdened with the workload. He said that nine companies (about 100 personnel each) of CAPF have arrived and have been deployed in various parts of the state, including Mumbai and Pune — the cities worst affected by Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-government-not-centre-funded-migrant-travel-anil-deshmukh/story-x9da0xqUmhwzhBzPzJi6qJ.html
17-05-2020||City||Bihar deputy CM welcomes Centre’s move to raise borrowing limit of states to 5% from 3%||PATNA Bihar’s deputy chief minister cum finance minister Sushil Kumar Modi on Sunday welcomed Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s announcement of increasing the borrowing cap of states from 3% to 5% of the state gross domestic product( SGDP), saying it would fulfil fiscal needs of the states.“At a time, when Bihar’s revenue has declined drastically following lockdown with the state earning only 14% of revenue in month of April this year as against corresponding period last year, the increase in borrowing limit is the only alternative to meet the resource gap. We had requested the Centre to increase the borrowing limit and it has been fulfilled,” said Modi.He said the increase in borrowing limit would help the state to take additional Rs 12,922 crore as loans as against the existing limit of Rs 39,341 crore. In addition to that, Modi said the government can take additional Rs 3,230 crore at the rate of 0.5% without any condition. On the states having used only 14% of the borrowing limit with 86% remaining unutilized, the finance minister said the state would take more loans as per need after assessing the fiscal situation and utilise the increase in borrowing limit.He said the announcement of allocation of additional Rs 40,000 crore in MGNREGA would benefit Bihar for creating more employment opportunities for migrants returning home.“ We have already issued 2.17 lakh new job cards and 3.50 lakh schemes are under implementation . Bihar has already Rs 1,124 crore as allocation under MGNREGA in month of April and the state is expecting allocation of Rs 2,535 as allocation under the job guarantee scheme,” he said.Modi also praised the focus of financial package on online education and the health sector. “ The decision of opening infectious disease hospitals in each district and public health labs at block level will facilitate in advanced health care system,” he said. “ In totality, this package is not only an interim assistance but would prove as a milestone in giving a big boost to the infrastructure and strengthening the economy in the long term,” Modi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bihar-deputy-cm-welcomes-centre-s-move-to-raise-borrowing-limit-of-states-to-5-from-3/story-ZXCU1dIYmbR2XluCtLcfFJ.html

17-05-2020||Patna||Bihar reports 8th Covid death, state tally touches 1,284||A 55-year-old resident of Khagaria who returned from Mumbai, died due to coronavirus on May 15, in what was the first reported death of a migrant labourer due to Sars-CoV-2 in the state, and the eighth so far to the virus in Bihar, as the number of cases swelled to 1,284, after 106 people tested positive for the pandemic Sunday.Patna reported a sharp spike in case, after 57 people, including 21 police personnel of the Bihar Military Police (BMP-14) tested positive from Khajpura locality. Two others reported positive from RPS More and one each from Agamkuan and Patel Nagar localities in the heart of the state capital. Seventeen other cases were reported from Barh, 12 from Athmalgola, two from Belchhi and one from Fatuha, satellite townships of Patna.Besides Patna, other cases were reported from Madhubani (16), Rohtas (14), Muzaffarpur (5), Arwal, Buxar, East Champaran (3 each), Kaimur (2) and one each from Sitamarhi, Nalanda and Saran.Among those testing positive from Patna on Sunday were two nurses — one each of the Nalanda Medical College Hospital (NMCH) and another from the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS), said Dr Ajay Kumar Sinha, medical nodal officer, NMCH.Among frontline health workers, a doctor from Nalanda, six health personnel, including four nurses from the IGIMS, and two nurses from the NMCH have so far tested positive for Covid-19, said sources.The health department, despite persistent requests, had, however, not provided a breakup of frontline healthworkers testing positive for Sars-CoV-2 in the state so far.As for the migrant’s death, Bihar’s principal secretary, health, Sanjay Kumar shared the information through a tweet on Sunday, even as health secretary Lokesh Kumar Singh did not mention about it at the customary government briefing on Sunday.The deceased, who was initially taken to the block quarantine centre at the Sharda Gayatri College, Maheshkoot, after reaching Khagaria from Mumbai via Saharsa on May 13, had complained of breathlessness the following day. He was rushed to the referral hospital, Gogri, within two hours of complaining about breathlessness to the medical team on May 14. He even showed signs of recovery, but passed away in the wee hours of May 15, said the doctor’s death report that Kumar had shared through a tweet.The doctor mentioned “cardio-pulmonary arrest” as the cause of death.Diabetic for the past two years, the deceased and his wife were tested for Covid-19 and both were found to be positive on May 16. The deceased had travelled with his wife and grandson by a Shramik Special train from Mumbai on May 11.“The man had shared space with 15 persons at the block quarantine centre. All of them will now be tested for Covid-19. The place is being sanitized,” said Khagaria district magistrate Alok Ranjan Ghosh.Ninety-nine samples of the 2,066 tested among the 3.53 lakh migrants at block quarantine centres had tested positive for Covid-19. Around 4.8% of the migrants have tested positive as compared to their samples tested (2,066), based on a set pattern of testing, said Singh.A total of 481 migrant workers of whom 423 had returned to the state after May 3, had so far tested positive for coronavirus, Singh had said on Saturday.Around 2.60% people in the state had tested positive for the virus so far as compared to the total samples (45,752) tested so far, he added.The recent spike in the number of positive cases of the virus was due to testing of migrants, contacts of Covid-19 cases and people who were symptomatic, added Singh.Over four lakh migrant workers from different parts of the country had reached Bihar by 272 Shramik Special trains so far this month. Another 438 special trains are in the pipeline to get all migrants who wanted to return to their home state, said Anupam Kumar, secretary, information and public relations department, during the media briefing.He said the figures on the total count of migrants expected to come to Bihar by these trains were being calculated.Forty-three trains, carrying 69,650 passengers had been planned to reach Bihar on Monday. Of them, eight pairs of trains would ply within the state from Kaimur, Gopalganj and Danpaur, he added.Meanwhile, 22 Covid-19 patients had recovered during the past 24 hours and discharged from different health facilities, taking the total number of people to have been cured from the disease so far in the state to 475.As of Sunday, Patna had surpassed Munger (125 cases) and topped with 163 cases. Rohtas reported 91 cases, followed by Nalanda (68), Buxar (62), Begusarai (54), Madhubani (69), Siwan (45), Khagaria (43), Kaimur (36), Bhagalpur (38), Bhojpur (36), Nawada (35), Banka, Gopalganj (32 each), Purnea (29), Jehanabad (27), West Champaran (25), Aurangabad (22), Sheikhpura (21), Muzaffarpur (25), Kaitihar (17), Darbhanga, Madhepura (16), East Champaran (19), Samastipur (15), Lakhisarai (14), Saharsa (13), Arwal (15), Jamui, Kishanganj (12 each), Supaul, Vaishali, Saran (11 each), Gaya (8), Sitamarhi (8), Araria, Sheohar (4 each) till the time of filing of this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/bihar-reports-8th-covid-death-state-tally-touches-1-284/story-BtvCRRx0dehi1wOkUYC8RI.html

17-05-2020||Chandigarh||Defeated virus, unable to dodge stigma: Chandigarh Covid survivors||After the coronavirus, a different battle awaits those who survived the deadly infection—stigma. A small microbe has managed to precipitate an alarming rift among the public, with Covid patients being the casualties, and undeservingly so. Those who have survived the virus and have come home are greeted to hostile stares or shifty glances from those who were once friendly neighbours.A month on, Parul Kalia, a London-based doctor, has recovered from the virus, but she is not stepping out of her home. “I have seen people suffer the ill effects of this virus. I treated them for two months. I saw young, healthy and happy people crash and die in no time,” said Kalia, who developed symptoms—high fever, cough, mild breathlessness and chest pain—after she returned to India.For her, the isolation period was the most traumatic, when she worried about her parents and wasn’t sure how her disease would run its course. Her details were shared on social media and people began stalking her, calling her names. “People didn’t respect my confidentiality which was most distressing,” she said.The fight is not over, she said, as she is fatigued, sleeps long hours and has mild breathing issues. “These residual effects improve with time. It people’s response I can’t come to terms with. They look at me as if I am a thing to look at,” said Kalia, who has been writing articles for journals and shot a video for Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) amid the lockdown.“The virus is here to stay and it going to impact mental health, too,” she warned.Chandigarh’s first Covid-19 patient, Fiza Gupta, and her brother Arnav Gupta who is also a survivor, recently donated plasma to save lives. A month on, people still think they are ‘virus carriers’.The 23-year-old Fiza said, “I have become more grateful about the good things in life. I had many plans, but this virus taught me to take life as it comes. I also realise now what it means to give back to society.”“Life, as we know it, has been turned upside down by the virus,” she said, adding, “The good part is that we as a family have bonded even more, and the sad part is that people avoid us as they still think we are infected. Some don’t come home while others are reluctant. It will take its own time.”Her brother, Arnav, 25, who tested positive a day after she did, was discharged on April 4. “People still look at me differently. I don’t blame them. If you see or hear about Covid 24x7, you are bound to panic. The ordeal gave me time to introspect and start meditation,” Arnav said, adding that he was grateful his family and friends stood by him.Meanwhile, the first health worker to catch the Covid virus after he treated a patient in PGIMER said he was aghast that people in his community think he is still a carrier. “I recovered and completed the isolation period. But when, after a month, I stepped out for an evening walk, unfriendly stares from my neighbours compelled me to go back home. It’s disturbing.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/defeated-virus-unable-to-dodge-stigma-chandigarh-covid-survivors/story-XuIKVpo67cpwUuqEdiUcGM.html

Earlier, over 50 schools out of Chandigarh’s 77 private schools had expressed their inability to pay salaries to their staff in view of the UT administration’s order.Following this, the education department had asked schools to upload their balance sheets online, by invoking the Punjab Fees Regulation Act, 2016. The Chandigarh Parents’ Association had also made several complaints against charging of fees. Even after two reminders, at least 60 schools are yet to upload their balance sheets.The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) affiliation bylaws, Punjab Fee Regulation Act, 2016, and several Supreme Court as well as high court rulings have stated that schools should not indulge in profiteering and commercialisation.As per the Punjab Fee Regulation Act, an “unaided educational institution cannot indulge in profiteering”, while making it mandatory for schools to upload income, expenditure account and balance sheet on their website. In case of violation, a regulatory body headed by the education secretary takes a call on it.A CBSE regional officer, who was not authorised to speak to media, said: “In case we receive any formal complaint, we will forward it to the central affiliation branch.”Rubinderjit Singh Brar, director, school education, UT, said the department will start issuing show-cause notices to the schools in the upcoming week. “We will issue show-cause notices and put up the issue for decision before the fee regulation authority,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/8-pvt-schools-in-chandigarh-upload-balance-sheets-online-show-surplus/story-cKUkjm7Zmri1eSlu09M1iO.html

With the summer turning on the heat day by day, they want a change in timings of relaxation hours.Many senior citizens claim they wake up early and 7 am is too late for a walk. Brigadier Keshav Chandra (retd) , founding member and former president of Chandigarh senior citizens association, suggested morning timings be revised to coincide with sunrise timings. “Retired army officers still wake up at ‘first light’ which is 30 minutes before sunrise. We used to attend a morning yoga class before the Covid-19 epidemic. The morning timing should be revised to coincide with sunrise which is around 5.30 am till June,” he said.President of senior citizens council of Sector 38, Major (retd) DP Singh said, “It is harmful for seniors to be walking outside after 7 am. Shifting the time to 6am or even 5am will be of great relief. The senior citizen bodies will ensure that seniors maintain social distancing and follow all safety norms.”A regular at Sukhna Lake for his evening walk, advocate Ajay Jagga now walks in Sectors 18 and 21 parks in the morning. He said, “I see the governments logic in keeping relaxation hours limited. Preventing the spread of Covid is our priority. However, frankly speaking, more relaxation would be nice. The sun is too bright now and even if relaxation is extended to 6 am it would be a relief.”Several youngsters are asking for more relaxation in evening hours so they can go for a workout in parks after sunset, which happens around 7.10 pm these days. An employee with an e-commerce firm, Chirag Puri, said, “Youngsters are working from home and work up till 6.30 pm. They don’t have the chance to step out before 7 pm. We urge the administration to consider at least a 30-minute extension of relaxation period.”Meanwhile the police continues to register cases under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code against those found outdoors during the night curfew hours. Police have booked more 213 morning and evening walkers since March 24, when the curfew was declared in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/relaxation-hours-inconvenient-morning-evening-walkers-in-chandigarh-seek-change/story-zmt7SBkFpyqixNefJEgzZJ.html

However, the premier institute has no plans to resume operations for now.The OPD services at PGIMER, Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, Government Multi-Specialty Hospital, Sector 16, and other allied hospitals were suspended on March 19 as the OPDs are overcrowded and norms like social distancing could not be followed to curtail the spread of coronavirus disease.Only emergency wings continued to remain open at the three medical institutes and three civil hospitals in Manimajra, Sector 45 and Sector 22.Chandigarh is a medical hub for the north Indian states where patients from as far as Jammu and Kashmir and even parts of Uttar Pradesh reach for treatment.UT health secretary Arun Gupta said they had not taken a decision on opening services at GMSH-16 and GMCH-32. “We will consider it after PGIMER opens. Besides, hospitals should be able to relieve some staff from Covid-19 duties and afford some crowd. Meanwhile, both hospitals are offering telemedicine facility,” he said.PGIMER also plans to start teleconsulations for various OPDs from Monday. But, has no plan on reopening the OPDs.“We are currently working on strengthening the teleconsultation services and thus cannot give any exact date and time for reopening the OPDs,” said Dr Jagat Ram, director, PGIMER.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/resumption-of-opd-services-chandigarh-hospitals-waiting-for-pgimer-to-take-the-lead/story-5fu0hx6RwJLtvS4g6DQzsL.html
17-05-2020||City||Slow start for Mohali industries, production down to 10% after lockdown norms ease||Two weeks after Covid-19 restrictions were relaxed and industries allowed to start work to revive the district’s economy, production is down 10%, only 40% labour remains after the migrant exodus and employee salaries have been slashed from 30% to 60%.Unable to bear losses after production was completely shut down by March-end and April, businessmen have been swift in imposing salary cuts, which has been demoralising for staffers already worried about an uncertain future. Most of the units are grappling with labour shortage, unable to increase productivity with 60% migrants leaving the state.Ever since industries opened on May 4, production levels have fallen 10%, claim industrialists, because of which salaries were cut. Some people also say they had to sign agreements for employers wanting to avoid legal action in case they fired anyone.“We’ve managed 10% production in the last two weeks. Earlier we used to supply tractor parts for Rs 80 lakh per month, but in the past two weeks we’ve managed sales worth Rs 6 lakh and not been able to meet monthly expenses of salaries, power bill and transportation,” says Mukesh Bassi, managing director, India Harness, which manufactures tractor parts.On salary cuts, Vivek Kapoor, vice president of Mohali Industry Association (MIA) says, “We requested the state and Central government to support small industries and help them pay salaries for the lockdown period from either the Employees’ State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) funds or from the labour cess funds. It would be appreciable if someone could pay from their own funds, but we could at least take care of the daily needs of the staffers.”An employee at an industrial unit in Phase-8-B, who had his salary cut by 50%, however, said it was strange that a month of lockdown had forced companies to slash salaries. “These units have been making profits for several years and now they are not able to pay staff after a month.”There are around 13,000 MSME units and 49 major industrial houses in Mohali district employing 1.30 lakh workers.INDUSTRIAL AREA: FACTS YOU MUST KNOW About 10 industries became operational in Mohali in 1978, growing to about 10,000 units, including manufacturing and IT/ service industry. The Industrial Area is divided in different phases: Phase 1 to 4 fall under the Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA), Phase 7, 8-A and 8-B under the Punjab Small Industries Export Corporation Limited (PSIEC) and Phase 9 under Punjab Infotech.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/slow-start-for-mohali-industries-production-down-to-10-after-lockdown-norms-ease/story-zGlY63KpAbAHMlmo0IpbZP.html

All the six fresh death were from Kolkata, it said in a health bulletin. The total number of coronavirus cases reported in West Bengal so far stands at 2,677.At least 8,668 samples were tested in the last 24 hours, the bulletin said adding that a total number of samples examined so far is 77,228.Sixty-seven COVID-19 patients were discharged from hospital following their recovery since Saturday, according to the health bulletin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/6-more-die-of-covid-19-101-new-cases-detected-in-west-bengal/story-9d034xKu3dvkjC3KBmEHzJ.html
17-05-2020||City||Renew passport, driving licence via genuine govt sites||As state governments begin to lift the lockdown, albeit cautiously and in stages, and government departments dealing with public services slowly start opening their doors, consumers have many anxious queries and I have been receiving quite a few of them recently.A senior citizen, for example, says his driving licence has expired and every time he has to take his car out to buy vegetables and fruits, he is worried about the police imposing a fine of ₹5,000 on him. His other worry is that when the regional transport office starts working again, there would be large crowds of people there, and therefore it may not be a safe place for someone like him, since he is part of the most vulnerable category susceptible to contracting Covid-19, as he suffers from diabetes and a heart ailment, besides being a senior citizen.In fact, from several such queries pertaining to vehicle registration certificates and driving licences, it is apparent that several consumers have not read the circular of March 30, 2020, issued by the union ministry of road transport and highways, extending the validity of all such documents, including driving licences and registration certificates that expired between February 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020.The circular has been sent to all states and union territories, with a request to implement the advisory. That should answer the queries of consumers with regard to expired driving licences, learners licences and the temporary registration of new vehicles.As for the worry about exposure to Covid-19 at the RTO, I am sure the RTO will make special arrangements to ensure the safety of those visiting their offices, particularly with respect to maintaining social distance. Many offices dealing with the public are also insisting on everyone wearing a mask, bringing sanitiser and having the Aarogya Setu app on their cellphones.Besides, these days many RTOs have provisions to apply for the renewal of driving licence online and even making the payment online. One may not be required to visit the RTO at all, or only make a brief visit if necessary.I must also mention that RTOs in many cities have changed for the better in recent years. In fact, I have noticed that in some RTOs, you get a token indicating your number in the queue and you need to go in only when that number flashes on the screen.Lastly, I must warn consumers to be extremely careful about fake RTO sites. Remember, the ones run by the government will end with nic.in or gov.in and not org.in or co.in. So do not fall for counterfeits and lose your money.In fact, the official website of the ministry of external affairs (Consular, Passport and Visa division—Passport Sewa) has issued a warning against fake passport sewa portals and stated that citizens/consumers should not mistake sites that end with .in or .org or .com for the genuine government site. The authentic site for the online submission of an application for passport-related services is www.passportindia.gov.in. Alternatively, one can use the official mobile app mPassportSeva by downloading it from the Android or iOS application stores.Speaking of passport services, a consumer from Shimla says the passport offices may be open, but going there would be tough in the absence of public transport. Keeping in mind these issues, the MEA has said it has relaxed the restrictions on the number of reschedules allowed for applicants in case they cannot come on the day of their appointment. I would also suggest that consumers send their queries to the official Twitter handle of the passport service: @passportsevamea.Since there are many consumer queries pertaining to different services vis-à-vis the lockdown , the consumer affairs ministry should act as the nodal ministry, compile all relevant information and make it available for consumers in one place.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/renew-passport-driving-licence-via-genuine-govt-sites/story-YSrhdcq3e5x5dSRNSAGXUM.html
17-05-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh’s medium pacer Siddharth makes fitness top priority, eyes Indian squad||If Covid-19 had not gripped the whole world, along with other global sporting events, Indian Premier League (IPL) season 13 would have been underway at the moment and Chandigarh-based medium-pacer Siddharth Kaul would have been seen in action for Sunrisers Hyderabad. In this national lockdown period, 29-year-old Kaul is spending time with his family at his house in Zirakpur and also making sure he is keeping mentally and physically fit. “I miss being there with Sunrisers Hyderabad during this time of the year. Before our first camp could get underway, first lockdown period had started. I hope the situation is way better in coming months and normalcy could resume. Nevertheless, I am spending time with my family. Otherwise I was always travelling or playing cricket,” said Kaul, who made his ODI and T20 debut for India in 2018.One hour of cycling in his housing society early morning, followed by yoga in the adjacent garden is how Kaul likes to start his day and keep fit. Kaul lives with his parents, Dr Tej Kaul and Sandhya Kaul, brother Uday Kaul and his wife, along with his own wife Dr Harsimran Kaur. “We have made two teams who do household chores and cooking every alternative day. I am placed in the team comprising my brother and mother. It is good to be helping out each other in this difficult time,” added Kaul, who meditates everyday for one hour at noon.One thing to which Kaul is hooked onto these days is the newly formed WhatsApp group of the Indian U-19 team, which won the 2008 Youth World Cup in Malaysia. Virat Kohli led the U-19 team to World Cup victory 12 years ago. “Tanmay Srivastav created this group. It was nice get in touch with everyone and reminiscing those amazing memories. Everyone has time at hand these days, so all are chipping in. Virat paaji also chats in the group and recalls the victory. We all have decided to organise a reunion once the lockdown ends and the virus scare is over,” said Kaul, who was hoping to earn India team call-up through a good showing in IPL. Punjab might not have qualified for the Ranji Trophy quarter-finals this season, but their most experienced bowler Kaul had a memorable showing in the tournament taking 27 wickets in five matches.While Kaul’s father was once Indian cricket team’s physiotherapist and also a retired coach from Sports Authority of India (SAI), his mother is still a coach with SAI. His brother has played first-class cricket for Punjab and now represents Chandigarh. “In the evening, we all indulge in fun-filled games on our terrace. Ludo, carrom, cards, etc., all indoor games have suddenly become our favourites taking us back in childhood. I also do weight training every evening,” said Kaul, who is hopeful that IPL takes place once Covid-19 subsides.“I hope the world is a happy place once this disease is beaten. So many lives have been lost to this pandemic. It is best to stay at home and maintain social distancing,” concluded Kaul, who has taken 232 wickets in 63 first-class matches.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-s-medium-pacer-siddharth-makes-fitness-top-priority-eyes-indian-squad/story-XmqcJvarmiCBVMp6ZKkTFP.html

The move is intended to plug the cases or prevent any community outbreak from happening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-drug-stores-to-submit-details-on-buyers-of-medicines-for-fever-cold/story-ORze49qUmmhIZalTmV8LDN.html
17-05-2020||Delhi||Over 60% of sex workers in Delhi return to their home states||Over 60% of Delhi’s sex workers have returned to their home states due to loss of means of livelihood amid the coronavirus-induced lockdown that pushed many of them to the brink of starvation. The fear of contracting the deadly pathogen has kept customers away, leaving a debilitating impact on sex workers in the city. Kusum, who is president of the All India Network of Sex Workers (AINSW) - a group of sex workers that assists others with legal rights, health issues and social security across the country, said over 60 per cent of the sex workers in Delhi have already left for their home states. “The 60 per cent population accounts for around 3,000 sex workers. According to government figures, a total of registered 5,000 sex workers reside in Delhi,” Kusum said. She said they were forced to leave the city after enduring weeks of struggle for basic facilities like food and medicines. Shalini, one such worker, moved back to her village in Uttar Pradesh after living for eight years in Delhi. “I ran away from my abusive home in UP at the age of 18. I wanted to be an actress but got into sex trade to support myself,” 26-year-old Shalini told PTI. “After getting into this business (sex trade), at least I was not struggling for food, I was not on streets. But ever since the coronavirus outbreak and the lockdown, I have zero customers and money is drying up,” she said. Another sex worker Rajni (name changed) said she and her four-year-old son have not eaten properly in the last two months. “When my son fainted out of weakness two weeks back I decided to move back. I have some relatives in UP who do not know what I do here. I will stay with them for some days before figuring out what to do next,” she added. Sharmila (name changed) who grew up as an orphan on the streets of Kanpur became a sex worker in Delhi five years ago to make ends meet. “But now there is no food, no medicines and no customers. It is impossible to survive any longer in Delhi with the savings that I have. The social distancing is going to hit our business more than anything so there is no point staying here,” Sharmila, who is planning to move back to Kanpur, said. Rajni, Sharmila and Shalini are residents of the Garstin Bastion Road, or more famously G B Road, and now renamed Swami Shradhanand Marg. There are around 100 brothels on the one-kilometre stretch housing approximately 1,500 sex workers. Activists fear that many of these women who were on medication for different diseases, including HIV-AIDS, will not be able to get proper treatment in their home towns. “We feel all the work which we did in the past years for HIV and other diseases would be of no use. Many of them who escaped abusive homes can again become victims of domestic violence. There are many concerns but mostly we are worried about their health,” Kusum said. She further said that similar migration of sex workers is taking place in other cities too. Amit Kumar, the national coordinator for the AINSW, said the GB Road has completely shut down and most of its residents have returned to their home towns. “We were doing our best to provide dry ration, medicines, masks and sanitiser. We also gave them basic information on HIV treatment,” he said. Kumar said many of the sex workers went to their homes during Holi but they did not return after that. India is currently under the biggest lockdown with around 1.3 billion people asked to stay home in view of the coronavirus pandemic. The nationwide lockdown was initially imposed from March 25 to April 14, but was later extended till May 17 to contain the spread of the deadly disease. The virus has so far claimed 2,872 lives and infected over 90,000 people in the country.

17-05-2020||Pune||Districts asked to look for spaces to be used as temporary jails||Ten days after a temporary prison was started in Yerawada, the Maharashtra state home department has released a government resolution to set up such facility in all districts of the state.Sunil Ramanand, additional director general, prison, Maharashtra will formulate the rules and operation of set-up. Narayan Shrikrishna Karad, deputy secretary, signed the government resolution.In Pune, the facility is set up at the girls, boys hostel which is used by the students of school run by Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Research and Training Institute (Barti). The organisation is run by the social justice and special assistance department of the state government.The property is located at a quiet area close to the central jail. It is sprawling with trees and a lawn - a location apt for a school. However, the children’s rooms have now been occupied by inmates.The staff quarters are located on the campus at a distance of 150 metres from the buildings that now house undertrials in cases ranging from petty theft to murder. While the men’s facility has 53 inmates, the women’s facility houses one person.“We get one-day duty here. Our job is simply to man the gate which is the single entry point here,” said senior inspector Gajendra Jagtap of Pune police crime branch.The jail staff manage the facility, but the security of the outer perimeter is the responsibility of the city police, Jagtap said.“Initially, 80 boys and 80 girls from the school stayed here. These are students from primary school to Class 12. At the beginning of the lockdown, they were asked to leave with all their belongings. The school building and staff quarters are in the same premise,” said a security official on anonymity.In April, the people arrested in Pune who were remanded to judicial custody, were taken to Satara jail. However, the inmates from Pune started testing positive for Covid-19, putting safety of all its inmates in jeopardy. The temporary facility got approval from the district collector office on May 3. The facility began operation on May 6, said officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/districts-asked-to-look-for-spaces-to-be-used-as-temporary-jails/story-3svggbsIyrDTc86Ni52IGM.html

It is said that Ma Narmada ka kankar kankar is Shankar (Lord Shiva) and Narmade Har-Jeevan Bhar,” Patel told PTI on Sunday.“As the Supreme Court, High Court and National Green Tribunal (NGT) have banned the excavation of sand with the help of machines in all rivers, those indulging in it are trying to kill the river.“Therefore, I have directed collectors of 11 districts under Narmadapuram and Jabalpur divisions to register attempt to murder FIRs against those indulging in illegal sand mining with machines,” he said.“They should be treated like any person accused of attempt to murder as Narmadaji is a living entity for us,” Patel, who is the minister in charge of the Narmadapuram and Jabalpur divisions, said.He said he would shortly be writing to collectors of other districts as well through which the river passes to register attempt to murder cases against illegal sand miners.Patel said he had ordered for the installation of CCTVs along the routes leading to the river and asked police to take action if trucks are found overloaded.Collectors have been asked to send daily reports in the action taken against sand miners, he said, adding that such moves would go along way in curb illegal sand mining and protecting and conserving the river.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/narmada-sand-mining-file-attempt-to-murder-cases-says-mp-minister/story-GPA25BGPit9O6takgXUFtO.html

17-05-2020||Pune||Pune’s largest slum, Janata Vasahat, which was Covid-free now has 6 +ve cases in 2 days||Janata Vasahat, a slum spread on 2.5 km area on Sinhgad road in Pune had largely stayed away from the Covid-19 pandemic due to self-discipline and a canal that kept the slum population segregated. Till the beginning of last week, this slum with a population of around 60,000 people had reported just one Covid-19 positive and the person had recovered and was discharged.In the last two days however, six fresh cases have surfaced here, casting a shadow on this slum which was emerging as an example of a success story for others. In Pune, many other slums have seen a major spike in positive cases, posing a major challenge before civic authorities.“There are a total of six cases reported from Janata Vasahat. We have sent a few more samples for testing and the reports are awaited,” said Chetan Kabade, Pune Municipal Corporation’s (PMC) ward officer from Sinhgad road.Located between Parvati hill on one hand and a canal on the other, the slum does not have too many entry-exit points which restricted the movement of its habitants. This helped the PMC staff to implement social distancing. According to civic officials, of the total positive cases in Pune, over 65 per cent cases have come from slums, mostly from Kashewadi slum in Bhavani Peth and Tadiwala road slum Dhole Patil road wards.As of May 15, Pune had 174 deaths and 3,093 positive cases due to the Covid-19 disease.While a number of slums were sealed by the civic body and declared as containment zones, Janata Vasahat, which is adjacent to Dandekar bridge, did not figure in the list of containment zones till Saturday.However, with fresh cases, the PMC sealed the entry and exit points of the locality freezing public movement here. Most of the people living here had migrated from Marathwada and other parts of Maharashtra during the 1972 drought. Pune municipal commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad said one reason why Janata Vasahat had largely remained free of Covid-19 till recently was the preventive measures adopted by the people. They did not come out in the open unnecessarily, avoided public toilets and there was no inter-mingling, he said. With the help from the local doctors, PMC staff and the police, people at this slum managed to keep Covid-19 at bay, unlike other slums, he said. With six cases from Janata Vasahat, the number of positive cases in Sinhgad road ward has risen to 23. It was Sinhgad road area which had reported Pune’s first Covid-19 case on March 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-s-largest-slum-janata-vasahat-which-was-covid-free-now-has-6-ve-cases-in-2-days/story-De1k8gqu4oLvcJTeDsmrxJ.html

A few cases have also been reported from the central jail.“All the inmates and staff members of Jaipur district jail have been tested for coronavirus. Cases have come up from one ward in Jaipur’s central jail also and now we have decided to conduct random sampling in other wards of the central jail,” DG (Prisons) NRK Reddy said.For random sampling in other jails where there is no case so far, the official said a decision would be taken tomorrow in a meeting with home department officials.“We would take a call on sampling in other jails tomorrow in a meeting,” he said.He said after a lockdown was announced in March, separate/isolation arrangements for new entrants were made in all the jails. A new entrant is kept in the new ward before shifting to regular wards after a period of 14-21 days.“Only during that time we found anyone suspicious or with symptoms; we used to refer him to hospital for check up,” he said.In Jaipur district jail, he informed, a prisoner who came into the jail in early April was the source of infection. He was asymptomatic when he was kept in isolation in initial days and later suffered from low BP and diarrhoea. He was tested for Covid-19 and the report came positive on May 9.In the meantime, the jail superintendent and a few other inmates got infected.The cases in Jaipur district jail spiked on Saturday when 119 prisoners tested positive. On Sunday, 14 prisoners (12 from central jail and two from district jail) tested positive for the virus.So far, more than 140 prisoners (maximum from district jail) have tested positive for the virus in Jaipur.After the prisoners tested positive, the jail department decided to shift new prisoners -- who come to Jaipur, Alwar and Sawaimadhopur jails -- to Dausa jail temporarily.Dausa jail has been vacated and the inmates and staff were sent to another jail in Dausa to create room for the new prisoners coming from Jaipur, Alwar and Sawaimadhopur.The officer said that 156 prisoners in the state have been released on parole, parole of 21 prisoners was extended and 11 prisoners have been released from jails after remission of sentence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/rajasthan-govt-to-decide-on-random-sampling-of-prisoners-for-coronavirus/story-zEIROf8s7cP1VD1FzL35FN.html

The couple along with their 10-year-old son had recently returned from institutional quarantine after completing their isolation period at a centre in Baran.

17-05-2020||Lucknow||UP prison admin starts random Covid-19 testing in jails||After the death of an inmate in Agra Central Jail due to Covid-19, the Uttar Pradesh Prison Administration and Reform Department has started random testing of samples for coronavirus in all the prisons of the state, a senior official said on Sunday. Fourteen jail inmates were quarantined following the death of the prisoner on May 8, Anand Kumar, DG of the Department of Prisons Administration and Reform, told PTI on Sunday. He said 13 jail officials who looked after the barrack where the prisoner was lodged were also tested for COVID-19. At present, there are 71 operational jails in Uttar Pradesh with over 94,000 inmates. So far, more than 16,000 inmates have been released either on bail or parole, Kumar said. To boost the immunity level of the inmates, yoga sessions are being conducted in jails. “The jail inmates are voluntarily attending the yoga classes. Yoga sessions are taking place in most of the jails as per the Ayush Ministry guidelines. ‘Kaadhaa’ is also being given to the inmates twice a day,” Kumar said. He also said that social distancing is being adhered to the extent possible in the jails. “Even today, there are 94,000 inmates in jails against a capacity of 60,000. Overcrowding is a problem. We are still 1.5 times above the sanctioned capacity,” he said. Kumar said every jail inmate has two-three masks and the prisons are being fumigated and sanitised regularly. “We are worried about older inmates whose immune systems are weak. There are around 4,000 convicted inmates who are above the age of 60. Barring exceptions, heinous offences and prohibited categories of crime, if these inmates can be released on interim parole for two months then overcrowding will come down in the jails. Deliberations are also going on in this regard,” Kumar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-prison-admin-starts-random-covid-19-testing-in-jails/story-zkiYFs5ENNf3sbs6HXpJYK.html

However, they had left their states to come to Punjab for work, and now that the restrictions are easing and the state has opened factories and other business establishments, I appeal to all of them to stay where they are,” said Upadhyay.Those who had made up their minds, however, should not walk and instead opt for buses and trains for their own safety and that of their dear ones, she added.Lehragaga deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Buta Singh said Upadhyay herself wanted to go home, but when she asked the civil administration for help she was asked to wait. That was when she decided to do something about the migrant crisis.“Ashu appealed to the migrants to work in Punjab as the government has opened the economy and there was huge demand of labour in factories, agriculture and other fields. She visited different markets and offices with police personnel to convince migrants to work in the state or leave by buses and trains, and not walk,” added Buta Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/up-migrant-is-policewoman-for-a-day-asks-workers-not-to-leave-punjab/story-zuhbESHmrxxXqBXlzWfJBK.html

17-05-2020||Noida||Lockdown: Day after UP govt’s order, migrants on foot stopped at Delhi border by police||Hundreds of migrant workers arrived on foot at Ghazipur in Delhi near the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border on Sunday morning to cross into Uttar Pradesh, hoping for authorities to make arrangements for them to travel in buses or trains for onward journey to their homes. This led to a build-up at the Delhi-UP Gate near Indirapuram when police stopped them from entering Ghaziabad.The Yogi Adityanath government had on Saturday asked police and administrative officials to ensure that no migrant worker travelled on foot or in vehicles such as trucks after 24 migrant workers were killed in UP’s Auraiya district when the truck they were travelling met with an accident in the early hours of Saturday morning. Sixteen of the dead had boarded the truck in an area under the jurisdiction of the Indirapuram police station in Ghaziabad.On Sunday, the police stopped the migrant workers at the UP-Gate border while they were trying to cross over to Ghaziabad in UP. Most of those who gathered there were people who had been working in Delhi and now wanted to go back to their states due to the lockdown.Ghaziabad police said that they could let migrants to enter as they were on foot and only those having valid train tickets would be allowed to enter.“We have not allowed them to walk on the highway and only those having valid train tickets will be allowed in. We have also not allowed any vehicles carrying migrant workers into Ghaziabad. Any such vehicles which have been spotted have been stopped and workers were made to de-board. Such vehicles like trucks will also face legal action,” said Anshu Jain, circle officer (Indirapuram).The migrants complained that they couldn’t make train reservations since many of them didn’t know how to do online booking.“We were made to sit at the border and not allowed to enter Ghaziabad from where we hoped to get on to some buses or trains to our hometown in Bihar. We don’t have any work now in Delhi and we need to go home now. We are not able to book train tickets online as many of us either don’t know how to do it or have mobile phones to do it,” said Iftekhar, a migrant from Purnia in Bihar who worked at Azad Market in Sadar Bazar area of Delhi.“There were people who even asked us for Rs 3000 to get the train tickets booked. We do not have so much money. So we decided to come to Ghaziabad and are now stranded at the border,” he added.Like Iftekhar, Tauseef also worked in a small factory in Delhi’s Sadar Bazar and was making curtain rings of late.“My factory has also shut tdown and the only way we can survive is to go home. But we are now stuck at the border while hundreds of migrant workers like us have already moved to UP and headed to their hometown. When we arrived here on Saturday afternoon by a bus which was headed to Noida, the cops stopped the bus and made us de-board,” said Tauseef who is native of Arariya in Bihar.“There were hundreds of migrant workers like us at the UP border but many escaped by walking alongside the (Hindon) canal area. We know that buses and trains are going from Ghaziabad but we are stranded here and have no means to book online tickets. Many migrant workers came to the border by dodging Delhi police. Although we were stopped at the border but food was provided to us,” he added.Later in the day, as hundreds of workers started coming in UP, authorities took them to different shelter homes in Ghaziabad from where their travel arrangements are being made.The UP government has given permission for operation of Shramik Special trains from Ghaziabad and Noida and trains have been running from these stations since May 15.The Uttar Pradesh government officials on Saturday said that 449 trains have arrived from other states while permission for another set of 286 trains has been given.“Within next 2-3 days when these trains arrive, about 9.5 lakh migrant workers eould have arrived in UP,” said Awanish Awasthi, UP’s additional chief secretary (home).The train services are free of cost for migrant workers but they have to register online and wait for an SMS which is sent by the state government for clearance of their train travel.Apart from the trains, UP roadways is also plying buses to different districts of the state. The UP Roadways till Saturday evening had sent about 600 buses to different areas from Morta in Ghaziabad with a seating capacity of 35 passengers as an average.The bus services have been operational for past one week and will continue for migrant workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/lockdown-day-after-up-govt-s-order-migrants-on-foot-stopped-at-delhi-border-by-police/story-xdrW79m4D7LH4kgysYBy2K.html

I have time. I want to help those athletes who have it in them to play for India but can’t because of money.

17-05-2020||Bangalore||Issue new lockdown guidelines including permission to operate public transport: K’taka Deputy CM requests Gadkari||Karnataka Deputy Chief Minister and Transport Minister Laxman Savadi on Sunday wrote to Union Minister Nitin Gadkari requesting to issue new lockdown guidelines including permission to operate public transport and said the lockdown has caused a financial loss of Rs 16,00 crore to all four Karnataka Transport Undertakings.In view of these problems, the state Transport Minister requested Gadkari to permit the deployment of Non-AC buses on scheduled routes to ensure the adequacy of services.The four State Transport Undertakings (STUs) in Karnataka which are providing bus-based public transport services within the state and to the neighbouring states are Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC), North West Karnataka Road Transport Corporation (NWKRTC), North Eastern Karnataka Road Transport Corporation (NEKRTC) and Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC).“KSRTC, NWKRTC and NEKRTC operate buses for mofussil services i.e. Interdistrict, intradistrict and interstate, whereas BMTC operates only in urban and suburban areas in the city of Bengaluru. The four STUs put together hold a fleet of about 24,900 buses including 1,520 air-conditioned buses and operate about 71.00 lakh km. per day and carries about 98.00 lakh passengers every single day,” Savadi outlined in the letter.The Minister said due to the Covid-19 outbreak and the lockdown that ensued have brought regular bus operations and functioning to a grinding halt.“This has caused a devastating impact on the operations of all the four STUs due to the combination of lack of revenue and continuing fixed costs such as salaries and pensions to staff, payables against existing loans etc. It has been estimated that the lockdown has caused a financial loss of INR 1,600/- crore to these four STUs,” he added.Savadi said even after post-COVID lockdown, operations and revenues won’t reach its previous demand& supply patterns in the next six to eight months due to reduced economic activity and users’ perceived risk of contacting COVID in public transport.In addition to that, “occupancy should be allowed up to seating capacity (without standees). This is essential to meet minimal demand,” he said in the letter.“The crew should wear facemask and hand gloves. The crew with health issues should not be deployed. The face masks should be made mandatory for all the passengers. Only asymptomatic persons should be allowed to travel in public transport. The Government of India may consider staggering working hours for various sectors to reduce peak hour traffic demand,” the minister listed out these recommendations in the letter.Savadi said that with social distancing norm of reduced seating capacity in public transport, it will not be possible to provide transport facility to all the daily passengers. This will create demand for more buses, which cannot be met.“Restrictions on public transport will lead to passenger commute by overcrowding in smaller vehicles like cars, maxi cabs, goods tempos etc. which will adversely affect preventive measures,” he added.Therefore, Savadi requested Union Minister to look into the above matter and issue fresh guidelines to all the states / UT’s.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/issue-new-lockdown-guidelines-including-permission-to-operate-public-transport-k-taka-deputy-cm-requests-gadkari/story-HEB2T2IMymi2U0ZouhqXvJ.html

17-05-2020||Kolkata||Kolkata hospitals in a spot as nurses quit jobs, leave city amid Covid-19 crisis||The healthcare sector in Bengal is staring at a major crisis as over 300 nurses have quit their jobs at private hospitals here and left for their homes in Manipur and other parts of the country amid spurt in COVID-19 cases.The Association of Hospitals of Eastern India (AHEI), a non-statutory body with 17 private medical facilities in Kolkata as members, has written to Chief Secretary Rajiva Sinha seeking his intervention in resolving the crisis.At least 185 nurses left for Manipur earlier this week. On Saturday, 169 followed suit -- 92 hailing from Manipur, 43 from Tripura, 32 from Odisha and two from Jharkhand, sources at the city’s private hospitals said.In his letter, Pradeep Lal Mehta, the president of the AHEI, said, “Although the exact reason why they are leaving is not known, we have found out from other nurses still on duty that the state government of Manipur is offering them a lucrative stipend to return home.” Taking to Facebook, however, Manipur Chief Minister Nongthombam Biren Singh rubbished the claim and said, “No such advisory has been issued by the state. We are not asking anybody to return. We feel proud of them as they serve the patients in Calcutta, Delhi and Chennai.” “We have already said that we will compensate and reward them for treating COVID-19 patients. But if the nurses,doctors don’t feel comfortable in the hospitals where they are working that’s up to them... I cannot force them to stay there. It’s their choice. That might be the reason why they are coming back,” Singh said in a video address.A nurse, who left for Manipur earlier this week, said safety concerns and parental pressure were the two main reasons she quit her job.“Our parents are concerned and we are stressed as the cases here are rising every day. Our state is a green state and we wish to go back. Our state government is helping us. Family and parents are our priority,” one of the nurses said when contacted over phone.A senior official at Bhagirathi Neotia Woman and ChildCare Centre in central Kolkata said many nurses have submitted resignations, while some have refused to report for work.“That they were going to leave (the state) was obvious,” he said.Other private facilities in the city facing a similar predicament include RN Tagore Hospital, Medica, IRIS Multispeciality Hospital, Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals Limited, AMRI hospital, Fortis Healthcare Limited, Charnock Hospital and Belle Vue.Meanwhile, sources in the health department said the government has sought information on nurses, including their place of origin, from different hospitals here.Letters have been sent to the respective hospital authorities, the sources added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/kolkata-hospitals-in-a-spot-as-nurses-quit-jobs-leave-city-amid-covid-19-crisis/story-RZXJV4F4Pqk3v4RneGIG1H.html

17-05-2020||Education||Without fees, private schools struggle to pay teachers’ salary||Over 20,000 teachers and 6,000 employees of 600 private unaided budget schools in the state have either not been paid salaries or just received a part of it since March. The situation is unlikely to improve anytime soon as school managements claim inability to pay teachers’ salaries due to parents not depositing fees.The management of these schools claim they don’t have resources to pay teachers.“Majority of poor parents are unable to pay fees. Hence we too are unable to pay salaries to teachers and staff during this lockdown. Ours is a budget school where we take nominal fees from parents,” said president, association of private schools of UP, Atul Kumar who is the owner of St Basil School.He admitted teachers were made part-payment in March and nothing in April or May. President of unaided private school association (UPSA) Anil Agarwal has issued an appeal to parents to pay fees. “I would make a fervent appeal to parents to pay the fees as this has posed a problem in payment of salaries and overheads like electricity bills, IT overheads, provident fund as we don’t have any other source of income,” said Agarwal. “There is however no pressure on those who cannot pay but majority of stakeholders choose private schools because they can afford it. There has been no increase in fees keeping in mind the pandemic and only monthly fees is being asked for. In these trying times therefore parents must come out to show their solidarity to the cause of education,” he added. The UPSA has written to Lucknow district magistrate, Abhishek Prakash to direct parents to pay the fees, at least for April. President of Prelude School, Agra, Sushil Gupta said the institutions were only able to pay half the salary to teachers. “Situation is unlikely to improve in near future as more than 60% of total fees is spent in salary of teachers and non-teaching staff,” he said.Principal of Gyan Kunj Montessori School in Indira Nagar, A block, Adila Singh said economically weaker section parents have enrolled their children in her school. “They are unable to pay fees regularly even on normal days, leave alone lockdown period,” Singh said.Owner of St Marys School, Gaurav Shukla who runs six branches said they are making part payment to teachers and employees as and when they are getting fees from parents. “Despite the fact that we aren’t getting fees, the school will make payments for 450 teachers and 200 non teaching staff in 15 branches till May and June. But from July it is going to be very difficult,” said principal of Pioneer Montessori School, Sharmila Singh. A number of schools said many parents weren’t paying fees as they hope the state government would announce fee waiver.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/without-fees-private-schools-struggle-to-pay-teachers-salary/story-ZPYr8sf41zihwyzgTR7UVP.html

17-05-2020||City||Son of retired ASI opens fire at police party in Ludhiana in bid to avoid checkpoint||The son of a retired assistant sub-inspector (ASI) opened fire at a police party in Ludhiana in a bid to escape as police commissioner Rakesh Agrawal and his security personnel gave him a chase after he jumped a checkpoint on Saturday afternoon. The accused identified as Sukhwinder Singh, 35, son of ASI Ram Kishan (retd), also tried to run over some cops.Police commissioner Rakesh Agrawal said that he was at one of the checkpoints, when he noticed a car jumping the checkpoint. He immediately ordered his personnel to stop the car but the accused managed to give them a slip.“An alert was immediately sounded in the city. The accused jumped at least six checkpoints and tried to run over the police personnel at Samrala Chowk and also hit the barricades before he was nabbed at Ladhowal,” said the police chief.After receiving an alert, the Ladhowal police set up barricades on the road. Inspector Balwinder Singh, Ladhowal station house officer, said the accused was driving rashly and on seeing the police party, he tried take a u-turn. In a bid of escape, his car crashed into the road divider. “When we moved forward, the accused flashed a gun and opened fire on the police party. We had a narrow escape but the accused was hit in the thigh during cross fire,” the SHO said.The accused has been admitted to Dayanand Medical College and Hospital (DMCH) for treatment. Police have recovered a .315 bore countrymade pistol, two bullets, one shell and 10 gm heroin from his possession. Police have also seized his Honda Jazz car (PB10EJ7777). His aide Prem Verma, who was in the car, was also arrested but he claimed to not know Parminder and said that he had only taken a lift. A case of attempt to murder, opening fire on police personnel, possessing arms and drugs has been registered against the accused.FATHER COMES TO ACCUSED’S DEFENCEASI Ram Kishan said that his son Sukhwinder Singh is under depression. He claimed that his son might have made a mistake and jumped the checkpoints in a bid of escape, but he does not possess any illegal weapon.Ram Kishan added that as Sukhwinder Singh is dealing with depression, he has been availing treatment from a local doctor for the past five years. “Due to the lockdown, he was irregular in taking medicines following which, his condition worsened. He had no sleep for the past three nights,” he said.“On Saturday he had an appointment with the doctor. As there was a long queue at the clinic, Sukhwinder asked me to stay there to wait for his turn, as he wanted to take a round of his office in Feroze Gandhi market. After sometime when I called Sukhwinder, he did not answered the phone. After repeated calls, when Sukhwinder did not respond, I left the clinic. Later, I came to know about the incident and rushed to Ladhowal police station,” said Ram Kishan.“Sukhwinder might have made a big mistake and the police have opened fire on him to overpower him, but he is not a gangster. He does not possess a weapon. He drinks occasionally, but he is not a drug addict. I have met the police chief and explained our position,”he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/son-of-retired-asi-opens-fire-at-police-party-in-bid-to-avoid-checkpoint/story-r88BI9Xskvpws9Gks9pRKJ.html
17-05-2020||Mumbai||IIT-Bombay develops wash-resistant antiviral coating for masks||With masks helping to contain the spread of Covid-19, the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay (IIT-B) has developed a wash-resistant antiviral and antibacterial coating for textiles. IIT-B has filed two patents regarding this technology.Known as the Duraprot technology, the coating crosslinks antibacterial and antiviral components on to the textile’s fibres through a simple dipping process. The coating is retained after several wash cycles and has been tested for 20 wash cycles — a prerequisite as per textile guidelines — at the IIT-B laboratory.“There has been an urgent need for personal protective equipment including two- and three-ply masks, N95 masks and gowns for healthcare workers. One approach is to enhance the functionality of two and three-ply masks with antibacterial and antiviral properties, “ said Rinti Banerjee, the Madhuri Sinha chair professor at IIT-B’s department of biosciences and bioengineering. “The coating materials are low cost and the idea is develop and scale up masks with antiviral activities at an affordable cost,” Banerjee said.Originally, Banerjee and her team had developed the antibacterial coating for medical textiles such as hospital gowns, bedsheets and consumer products (like socks and underclothes). The efficacy of the coating has been tested against samples of the Sars-Cov-2 virus in the laboratory. “When we tested the Duraprot coating against coronavirus samples from Kasturba hospital, there was a breakdown of the envelope inactivating the coronavirus,” said Banerjee.At present Duraprot technology is licensed to Meemansa, a Mumbai-based textile and garment manufacturing company. “We have sent the fabric with coating for validation to an external testing agency. We are expecting the results mid-next week after which we will begin the process of coating the masks that we have already manufactured,” said Priyanka Bapna, founder of Meemansa. “The process of coating masks takes two days followed by drying them naturally right now since our factories are closed. Once the lockdown lifts, we will dip the entire fabric in the mixture before manufacturing the products,” she said.Banerjee said talks are also on with two to three other textile manufacturers. “We are maintaining non-exclusive licensing due to the scale of the epidemic and will transfer our technology to multiple textile manufacturers. We will teach them how to prepare the coating mixture, and walk them through the process,” said Banerjee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/iit-bombay-develops-wash-resistant-antiviral-coating-for-masks/story-55fVQlAENm0otrdem5EnaP.html

17-05-2020||City||6 lakh migrants in Maharashtra’s Bhiwandi left in lurch amid lockdown||Forty-two-year-old Sayantan Gupta has been running from pillar to post from the past one week to get a chance to board any of the buses or trains that head to his hometown Jaunpur in Uttar Pradesh. However, despite repeated attempts, he was unable to do so and continues to live in his rented one-room house with five other men in Bhiwandi’s Padmanagar area. Bhiwandi has more than 10 lakh power loom factories, where migrant labourers are employed. “Although announcements regarding buses heading to different states are being made, we have no idea how to reserve a seat. I have visited various government offices and even the bus depots and train stations but have not received much help. The past one month-and-a-half has been very frustrating, living in a small room with five others without sufficient food to eat. Back home we have a farm. I will be with my family and get basic food items, which will be helpful to survive this lockdown,” said Gupta.Gupta’s tale is similar to what many of the around 6 lakh migrant loom workers in Bhiwandi, who had been struggling to make ends meet due to the lockdown. Some of them have managed to go back home. Most of these labourers are staying without their families and are unable to send money back home as they have not received wages since March 15. Many of them are surviving only on water or some days manage to get one meal.Although provisions for community kitchens have been made at various places across Bhiwandi, they do not seem to be sufficient, say migrants. “We stand in long queues at community kitchens but before our turn comes, the food gets over. It’s really difficult to survive as we have no money to buy groceries,” said Rakesh Yadav, 34, another loom worker from Kamatghar.Yadav said he has survived on water for many days. “On the days we are very hungry and have no food, we gulp down lots of water. We do not deserve such inhuman treatment. The authorities should have given us groceries, then we would have managed to cook something better,” he added.Meanwhile, migrant labourers who are observing their Ramzan fast are forced to break the fast with just water as they lack enough money to buy proper food. “We do not have the strength to go looking for food. If the community kitchen near our house provides us with lunch, we save it for iftaar [meal while breaking the fast]. Otherwise, we rely on just plain water and sleep empty stomach. On some days, our neighbours or friends get food for us,” said Aslam Sheikh, 35, a resident of Nayi Basti.With the migrant crisis getting worse, many social organisations have come together to ensure that food reaches the lakhs of migrant workers stranded in Bhiwandi. But they said community kitchens need to be better organised.“Although there are many social organisations and a few community kitchens that have stepped up to provide food and groceries, there is no logistical distribution. There could be some areas where the same people have received meals more than once and a few others who stay hungry all through the day,” said Govind Sharma, President, Samvaad Foundation. Social organisations also worry that they can continue giving free meals only till their donations last. Meanwhile, power loom owners and labourers are also worried about the post-lockdown scenario. Jivraj Nagariya, chairman, Power Loom Owners’ Federation, Bhiwandi, said, “After the lockdown, getting back to business will be very difficult as many labourers are heading back to their homes. We have to start all over, right from getting raw materials to restarting the factories after the lockdown ends. We will need the government’s support to spring back to business.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/6-lakh-migrants-in-maharashtra-s-bhiwandi-left-in-lurch-amid-lockdown/story-Xy0Je5zUI4AY86cg7qMAHP.html
17-05-2020||Mumbai||3.86 lakh migrant workers left Maharashtra in 12K buses, 191 trains: State government||The state government on Saturday said that around 3.86 lakh migrant workers had returned to their home states from Maharashtra through 191 trains and around 12,000 buses. The state also informed that the Bihar and West Bengal governments were earlier not willing to take back the workers who hailed from the two states. However, after talks with the respective state leaderships, Bihar and West Bengal agreed for the migrants’ return, following which the first Shramik Special train for West Bengal left from Mumbai on Saturday morning.Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh said that the state government has sent 2.45 lakh migrant workers to their respective states through 191 trains so far. “Only two states, West Bengal and Bihar, were not ready to take back their workers. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and NCP [Nationalist Congress Party] chief Sharad Pawar personally spoke to Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar and West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, after which the issue was resolved,” Deshmukh said.The home minister added that the crowd of stranded migrant workers can be controlled if around 10 trains leave for Bihar and West Bengal everyday.Deshmukh also said that the state government is bearing the cost of the train tickets to ferry the migrants home, as Thackeray had approved funds worth ₹54.40 crore from the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund. Meanwhile, the chief minister’s office, in a press release, said that the state has sent 1.41 lakh migrant workers to Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Telangana, Chhattisgarh and Karnataka on 11,798 state transport (ST) buses. Twenty-five trains operate from Maharashtra everyday to take back migrant workers to their home states.Most number of trains (117) had departed from various stations across the state for Uttar Pradesh, followed by Bihar (26), Madhya Pradesh (21), Rajasthan (9), Odisha (7), Jharkhand (5), Karnataka (3), Jammu (2) and Andhra Pradesh (1).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/3-86-lakh-migrant-workers-left-maharashtra-in-12k-buses-191-trains-state-government/story-hvK8HibB1Nh9irab2TNMtO.html
17-05-2020||City||Covid-19 outbreak: Mumbai civic body to start clinical trials for Remdesivir at Nair Hospital||After testing a drug used for psoriasis, Itolizumab, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has decided to start clinical trials for Remdesivir, an antiviral drug used for treatment of Ebola, on Covid-19 at BYL Nair Hospital.Remdesivir is an experimental antiviral drug developed by the US-based pharma major Gilead Sciences in 2014 as a cure for Ebola. Since then, it has been used to treat Middle East Respiratory Syndrome and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, both of which are caused by other strains of the coronavirus. It has been found to effectively block Sars-CoV-2 virus and boost recovery among coronavirus patients. With the cases set to surpass the 18,000 mark, the BMC is keen on improving the recovery rate. “Clinical trials of Remdesivir in other countries have shown success in treating coronavirus patients. It doesn’t cure patients like Tamiflu, but helps reduce the recovery time from 11-15 days, resulting in faster discharge,” said Suresh Kakani, assistant commissioner (health), BMC. The World Health Organization (WHO) in a statement said, “It works by shutting down viral replication.”Explaining how the drug works, Dr Om Srivastava, a city-based epidemiologist, said, “Sars-Cov-2, which causes Covid-19, has a single Ribonucleic acid (RNA) segment which duplicates as it infects cells using an enzyme— polymerase. This enzyme strings together with new strands of RNA. The RNA is composed of four bases. Remdesivir is an analog that closely resembles one of those bases— Adenine. So, when the drug is injected into the body, the virus grabs the Remdesivir and inserts it into the RNA. Thus, it corrupts the RNA and stops it from producing more virus.”To obtain the quickest scientific data to treat patients with Covid-19, WHO has announced a ‘solidarity trial’ where thousands of patients all across the world are encouraged to try the promising drug and disclose the findings. The international health community has maintained that of the drugs in the WHO solidarity trial, Remdesivir has the best potential — the drug shows that it can be used in high doses without causing toxicities. The US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) conducted a study of Remdesivir on 1,063 patients and found success. Again, in a study conducted by Dr Aruna Subramanian, a clinical professor of medicine and infectious diseases at Stanford University School of Medicine in California, 50% of patients who were given 5mg of the drug improved in 10 days. However, a study published in international science journal Lancet under ‘Remdesivir in adults with severe COVID-19: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial’ state that “Remdesivir did not provide significant clinical or antiviral effects in seriously ill patients with Covid-19.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bmc-to-start-clinical-trials-for-remdesivir-at-nair-hospital/story-ryfwmXWzhMmOtRiuqLAsaN.html
17-05-2020||Chandigarh||Expressing grief, dealing with solitude through art in times of Covid-19||The artists of Le Corbusier’s city have taken it upon themselves to express the grief of loss and experience with stillness and healing during the lockdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic. So, the months April and May have yielded over a 100 works of art in different mediums by artists young and senior.The first collection of paintings and sculptures by 30 artists of the city has been mounted in a well-curated online show. It is interesting indeed to see how each artist in his or her own unique way has responded to a season in which the human species remained confined indoors as nature reclaimed its spaces free of pollution.Each artist has a story to tell. Interestingly, sculptor Vishal Bhatnagar was without his sculpting tools and material at home during the lockdown. “I watched my wife Reena make paintings and yearned to do some work too. Finally, I came across some mango wood used for havan (ritual by fire) and the sacred red cotton thread called mauli. So I worked on these and the result is a very interesting form resembling a bull pushing through troubled times made of pieces of wood held together by red thread,” says Bhatnagar.Meanwhile, his wife Reena did a series of paintings in her usual architectural motifs capturing in colour the form of Le Corbusier’s city sans its people.For Daphy Brar, a fashion designer exploring the artist within her, this is a time of great personal sorrow as her mother passed away a few days before the lockdown. “The first painting I made was that of my mother with her face painted in monochrome, flaming pink petals for hair. It was a painting of grave loss but also a celebration of her life and spirit. This led me to make other portraits of friends and others who have enriched my life in motifs of cheer against the dark blues of the skies,” she says.Among the other artists included in the show are Madan Lal, Satwant Singh, Jaskanwal Jit, Vijay Ozo, Mahesh Prajapati and others. Naturescapes by Bheem as well as Lippi Parida deserve a mention. One now waits for more.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/expressing-grief-dealing-with-solitude-through-art-in-times-of-covid-19/story-hrC3i8FFyNsOydrkyvhiBJ.html
17-05-2020||Mumbai||Record spike takes Maha case tally past 30K; toll jumps by 67||Maharashtra on Saturday recorded its highest single-day jump in Covid-19 cases with 1,606 new infections, bringing the case count past 30,000 to 30,706.The state’s toll jumped by 67 deaths to 1,135. Only 22 of the 67 deaths occurred in the 24-hour period, while the remaining – 45 -- deaths had occurred between April 14 and May 14 and were added to the total on Saturday, the state health department said.Of the 67 casualties, Mumbai recorded 41, taking its death toll to 696.Besides Mumbai, Thane and Pune recorded seven deaths each, five in Aurangabad, three in Jalgaon, two in Mira-Bhayander and one each in Nashik and Solapur.On Saturday, Mumbai recorded 884 new coronavirus infections, taking the tally to 18,555, the state health department said. Pune recorded 161 new Covid-19 cases, while Thane recorded 114, Navi Mumbai 105 and Aurangabad 93.The state has so far registered 15,181 cases in the third phase of the lockdown, which is higher than the total it recorded in the 19-day lockdown between April 15 and May 3. In the second phase of the lockdown, Maharashtra recorded 11,627 Covid-19 cases.State health minister Rajesh Tope said that the lockdown has helped restrict the spread of the disease in the state. He added that the doubling rate has also increased during the lockdown period in Mumbai and the overall state.The doubling rate — the number of days it takes for Covid-19 cases to double — has improved, he said. The state’s doubling rate is at 11.5 days, while Mumbai’s stands at 14 days. State health minister Rajesh Tope said, “The doubling rate has increased to 14 days in Mumbai now. This is a big improvement from the earlier doubling rate of 7 to 8 days. Elsewhere in the state, too, we are trying to contain the spread in hotspots. We are working towards stricter enforcement of lockdown in such containment areas, so that cases reduce.”The state health minister has already said that Maharashtra would see the peak of the Covid-19 outbreak by June-end. He said that they are preparing for a projection of over 50,000 cases in Mumbai in three weeks. “There are various projects. Some mathematical projections haven’t been accurate, but we are preparing for the worst. Currently, Mumbai has about 17,500 cases. It could increase three times by around June 20; so it would go over 50,000. We are preparing accordingly,” he said.As the fourth phase of the lockdown starts from May 18, it is expected to have even more relaxations for industries and businesses in districts that fall in the green and the orange zones.For the red zone, the state government is open to allowing further relaxations outside the containment area; a decision is expected next week.A senior bureaucrat said, “We are awaiting Centre’s directives for lockdown protocol in the red zone. As the PM had indicated in his last address that the next phase would be different, we expect that more activities would be allowed outside containment areas. The sense among decision-makers is that we have to live with Covid-19.” The Centre is yet to issue guidelines for the next phase, following which the Maharashtra government would issue its guidelines.State home minister Anil Deshmukh said that over 2.45 lakh migrant labourers have been sent back to their home states by 191 Shramik trains. He added that the first trains carrying migrant workers to Bihar and West Bengal, which had so far disallowed labourers to come back, departed from Maharashtra on Saturday.“Around 2.45 lakh migrant workers have been sent to their respective home states by running 191 train services till now. We could not send trains to Bihar and West Bengal since these states did not allow it. But [NCP chief] Sharad Pawar and chief minister Thackeray personally spoke to West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee and Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar over the phone. Today, the first trains carrying migrant workers to West Bengal and Bihar were sent,” Deshmukh said in a video message.The trains are being run from parts of Maharashtra to Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Jammu and Kashmir, Jharkhand and Andhra Pradesh. Deshmukh also informed that 3,71,310 migrant workers have been kept in 3,884 shelters across the state and the state government has arranged for their food.Continuing the evacuation of migrants who are desperate to return to their homes, the Maharashtra State Transport Corporation (MSRTC) has, so far, ferried 1.42 lakh migrant workers in 11,380 buses to the state’s borders.Meanwhile, as cases in Kolhapur have started to climb up, the district’s guardian minister Satej Patil has said that people from red zones such as Mumbai and Pune should not come to Kolhapur. He said that 22 of the 36 cases in the district are related to people coming from the red zone.“Under the pretext of medical emergency, thousands of people are entering Kolhapur from red zones such as Mumbai and Pune. Most of the cases that are there in Kolhapur are from people coming from outside. Therefore, I appeal to people that those who have facilities to live in Mumbai and Pune should remain there. Only those with genuine need or emergency should come here. We need to see that the coronavirus cases do not spread in Kolhapur,” he told new channels.He added that with over 20,000 people entering the district since movement was allowed with requisite permission, the influx has added burden on the state administration. The institutional quarantine facilities in the district are teeming with people and it is expected to run out of space, an official from the district collector office said. “Swab tests are being done of people entering. Till results come, they have to be kept in quarantine facilities and it is adding to the burden. We have requested the state police to add that permission from Kolhapur collector is needed before allowing people into the district,” Patil added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/record-spike-takes-maha-case-tally-past-30k-toll-jumps-by-67/story-zWFRvUtYAVd4P0k31Z8a9L.html

17-05-2020||City||J&K admn allows home delivery of bakery items on Eid, to hold training session for bakers||Amid the coronavirus enforced lockdown, Eid celebrations in Kashmir will be a simple affair.The administration has allowed home delivery of bakery items in Srinagar in the run-up Eid falling by the end of this month.The administration has started giving training to bakers to sensitise them about precautions they need to follow for personal safety, production and home distribution of the bakeries to households.This is the first step as part of the month-long plan to give training to some 10,000 service providers like vegetable sellers, milk suppliers, hairdressers, laundry, public transport, and telecommunications aimed at a ‘guarded exit’ from the ongoing lockdown.On Friday, the Srinagar administration launched a two-week-long training programme for various service providers and the first module of the training was meant for more than 500 workers of around 180 bakeries in Srinagar city.“The existence of coronavirus pandemic is a reality and that people will have to learn to live with it, though following all precautions is crucial,” said Srinagar deputy commissioner Shahid Iqbal Choudhary while launching the module.Choudhary said all main services providers will be trained about precautions, hygiene, social distancing and other notified protocols during the programme.A government spokesperson said that the bakery sector has been chosen for opening in view of the upcoming Eid festival and the bakers will be tested for Covid-19 before being allowed to proceed.Eid-ul-Fitr falls on May 24 or 25 depending on the appearance of the moon and people are expected to celebrate it indoors owing to the lockdown which was imposed mid-March to contain the spread of Covid-19. The number of Covid-19 cases has crossed the 1000-mark with 11 deaths in the Union territory.This is the second time that Eid is being celebrated under lockdown in Kashmir. Last year, it was when the special status of the UT was revoked in August and the region put under restrictions.President Bakers and Confectioners Association, Omar Mukhtar said that the administration will train workers of around 421 of their registered units across the Valley of which some 180 are in Srinagar.“All our happy moments are incomplete without bakery. It is our tradition and we are happy that we have been allowed to home deliver on Eid,” he said.Every year, Kashmiris consume around ₹5 crore worth bakery products on Eid every year besides the daily consumption.Mukhtar said that every bakery unit has been asked to maintain a minimum number of workers in a safe and hygienic framework and they will be reducing their production. “We will be producing some one-third of what we used to produce during normal days,” he said.Bakers have been instructed to only sell packed products and to avoid loose bakery items. The units have to cater to their own localities only within a radius of 3-4 km.The training modules for service providers include a range of aspects including training certificates to participants, PPE kits, protective gear, Covid-19 tests, specially designed service tokens, movement passes, IT apps and online facilitation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/j-k-admn-allows-home-delivery-of-bakery-items-on-eid-to-hold-training-session-for-bakers/story-fWaY83zJp4AgiLHCgVtmTL.html
17-05-2020||Chandigarh||MHA found no fault with admn’s curfew relaxations: UT adviser||The UT administration said on Saturday that the Union ministry of home affairs (MHA) has found no fault in the curfew relaxations allowed in Chandigarh.Following MHA orders, the UT on May 3 had lifted the curfew allowing inter-city movement, unrestricted movement of vehicles, opening of industrial activities and neighbourhood markets, besides other places like Sukhna Lake. On Thursday, advocate Pankaj Chandgothia had filed a public interest litigation (PIL) before the Punjab and Haryana high court, claiming that UT had violated the MHA guidelines. Disposing of the matter on Friday, HC had left it to MHA to examine the orders with UT and make changes if the relaxations by the latter were not in consonance with the ministry’s guidelines.UT adviser Manoj Kumar Parida said after HC directions, UT and MHA officials held a video conferencing meeting on Saturday in which the curfew relaxations in the UT were thoroughly examined. “The meeting was exhaustive and MHA found no fault in UT’s orders. MHA also said there is no need to issue any corrigendum.”‘THREE CONTENTIONS ADDRESSED’Parida said that the PIL had three major contentions — allowing inter-city movement, opening of sector markets and opening of Sukhna Lake.“MHA was convinced when we told them that inter-city movement was required in Chandigarh since the city was the joint capital of both Haryana and Punjab. Their governments can’t be closed down as they have to operate from here. Moreover, Chandigarh is part of the tricity, where the three towns are dependent on each other,” said Parida.He added that the decision to open sector markets was also endorsed by the ministry since these markets fell within the definition of neighbourhood markets as allowed in the MHA orders.“Ministry appreciated the decision of the UT to introduce the odd-even formula in opening the sector markets,” said Parida. On the opening of entertainment places, Parida said, “We told the MHA that Sukhna Lake was not a place of entertainment. Only walking is allowed there.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/mha-found-no-fault-with-admn-s-curfew-relaxations-ut-adviser/story-3ammnZsCyWe7EXyPwAGYXO.html

The subject seems to be about the establishment of benches of CAT in the Union territories of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh,” clarified Justice Reddy in an official release.“A DO letter happens to be the communication between its author and the addressee and it is not made public particularly when it is between highly placed dignitaries. Since the news item was only about the establishment of the Benches and is a matter of relevance for the CAT, I contacted the minister to know about the subject. He informed me that he did not receive the letter either in the form of a hard copy or through e-mail,” he added.Going by what is published in the media, it appears that the Chief Justice expressed concern over the ability of the tribunal to handle the service matters of the UT as and when transferred. Comparative statements were also furnished as regards the pendency in the entire tribunal on one hand and the pendency of service matters in the HC on the other hand. Many statements in the attachment of the news item on the website of “Bar & Bench” were indeed not called for and at any rate, were not a matter of concern for the HC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/don-t-be-so-apprehensive-about-disposal-of-service-cases-cat-chairman-to-j-k-chief-justice/story-tF4zheHf1RIdjj3OCIEeWP.html

Mumbai also recorded 41 deaths on Saturday, bringing the toll to 696. Of the 41 deaths, 14 deaths were reported between May 7 and May 12. Dharavi recorded 53 new cases on Saturday, pushing the tally to 1,198. The toll stayed at 53.The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Saturday said they had changed the testing protocol to ensure Covid testing is available for all symptomatic suspects. “Testing is available for persons with symptoms such as fever, cough, or breathing difficulty, close contacts of confirmed cases with symptoms, pregnant women 4 to 5 days before delivery coming from containment zones, patients on haemodialysis who are showing symptoms or are suspected cases of Covid-19”, said the BMC’s testing advisory. High-risk or co-morbid close contacts having no symptoms may be tested as per the advice of healthcare worker once between five and 14 days. The BMC also said that no testing will be required for patients completing home isolation. No testing is needed at the time of discharge from the hospitals for mild and moderate cases as per revised guidelines, the testing advisory said.Of the total deaths in Mumbai, 24 had co-morbidities; 26 were men and 15 were women; 2 deceased were below 40 years, 27 above 60 years and 12 between 40 and 60 years.In line with the Maharashtra government’s deliberation on Friday, which stated that cases are likely to peak by the end of June, the BMC has begun ramping up its bed capacity at all Covid Care Centres category 1 (CCC1) for high-risk contacts, Dedicated Covid Health Centres (DCHC) for mild symptomatic patients, at Dedicated Covid Hospitals (DCH), ICU beds, and beds with oxygen points. Sanjeev Jaiswal, additional municipal commissioner and incharge of the BMC’s coordination with the state government, said, “Our preparations will now get over by May-end. These are being made keeping June’s cases in mind. If we have to be prepared for a possible surge of cases in June, preparations must be completed by May.”The CCC2 facilities for asymptomatic and mild symptomatic patients were not being used to its capacity. While the BMC is going to retain some CCC2 facilities, they will be converted to DCHC facilities, with oxygen points. The BMC will add 10,000 additional beds to the DCHC facilities, at least 50% or more of which will have oxygen points, Jaiswal said. Some beds at these DCHCs will be converted into full-fledged hospital beds (DCH) at 30% of their scaled capacity. While Mumbai will get an additional 3,000 ICU beds, 1,000 of the ICU beds will be part of the DCH beds created in the DCHC jumbo centres. Such centres are the NESCO exhibition grounds at Goregaon, NSCI dome at Worli, Mahalaxmi racecourse, CIDCO ground at Mulund and Metro ground at Dahisar.Apart from that, dialysis for Covid patients will be made available in the DCH part of the DCHC facilities at these jumbo centres, where 10% beds will be reserved for patients who also need dialysis. At the NESCO exhibition grounds, the BMC will scale the bed capacity from existing 1,000 beds to 2,500 beds. Of these, 250 to 300 beds will be ICU beds. At the BKC grounds, the BMC will scale the capacity from the existing 100 beds to 200 beds, of which 150-odd will be ICU beds. At the CIDCO ground at Mulund, capacity will be scaled to 2,000 from the existing 100 beds with 150-200 ICU beds. At the Metro grounds at Dahisar, the capacity will be scaled to 1,500, but its design is still being prepared, with an ICU capacity of 150-200 beds. At the racecourse, the bed capacity will be increased to 800 from the existing 300, with 120 ICU beds. NSCI Dome in Worli will get a 30-bedded ICU facility. CCC1 centres will have a scaled capacity of up to 1,00,000 beds by May-end. The BMC has begun readying gymkhanas, marriage halls, dormitories in schools and colleges. On Friday, it took over the Wankhede stadium in Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/884-new-cases-bring-city-tally-to-18k-bmc-braces-for-surge-by-end-of-june/story-JxN9ho859yWjThmpQyvi0K.html

Assets of Ankit Kumar and Sunil Kumar worth a total of ₹7.73 crore were seized under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) in the case.The attached assets are held in the names of M/s Sanatan Financers and Real Estates Pvt Ltd, Goa. “The accused persons illegally collected funds from these foreign nationals in the guise of selling properties in the Peace Valley project,” read an ED statement issued on Saturday.ED initiated the investigation under provisions of PMLA based on the first information report (FIRs) registered by Goa Police on the complaints filed by at least 50 scammed foreign nationals. “During the course of the investigation, it was revealed that the accused had collected money from the foreign nationals through foreign direct investments (FDI) to the accounts of their various shell companies including M/s Sanatan Financers and Real Estates Pvt Ltd. The foreign nationals were convinced to invest in the companies formed by the accused towards the purchase of flats and villas,” the agency said. “However, the ownership of said flats/villas was never transferred to the foreign nationals. In this manner, from 2006 to 2011, the accused had received ₹7.73 crore by duping the foreign nationals and acquired 16 villas worth ₹2.56 crore and 56 flats worth ₹5.17 crore. These assets and balance in the [accused’s bank] accounts, being proceeds of crime, have been provisionally attached under PMLA,” the statement added.As per Indian law, foreigners are not allowed to buy properties in the country and this violation attracts provisions of the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA).

17-05-2020||City||Transformer repair firms in Kashmir seek pending payment, abstain from work||The Kashmir Transformers Repair Association has been refusing to turn up for work following a row over non-payment of dues worth ₹30 crore. Two years on, the Jammu and Kashmir administration failed to clear their liabilities, forcing the private firms not to take up any further repairing assignments from the Power Development Department (PDD). The workers have gone on an indefinite strike after the administration failed to clear their dues. However, officials of the department have cited the shortage of funds for non-payment.The association is functioning under Small Scale Industrial Units (SSIUs), a private body working in collaboration with the Jammu and Kashmir Industries and Commerce DepartmentJalal Ud Din Wani, president of the association said that the power department has not paid their dues for the last two years. “I have asked my workers to boycott work completely till the government addresses our grievances,” he said, adding that they have taken up the matter with the PDD officials but to no avail. Wani said that more than 10,000 people associated with these firms have lost their livelihood. Abdul Aziz Rather, a unit-holder, said that he receives over 10 transformers per day for repair from the power department. “It costs thousands of rupees to repair a single transformer. We won’t repair even a single electricity transformer now as the administration has not paid us the dues,” he said.With nearly 200 damaged transformers lying with these unitholders in different parts of the Valley, people may face dark nights ahead. With the deadlock between the association and the power department, the transformer damage rate in Kashmir has gone up 60% due to overloading. Kashmir PDD chief engineer Aijaz Ahmad Dar said: “The government is looking into the matter and the issue will be resolved within a month.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/transformer-repair-firms-in-kashmir-seek-pending-payment-abstain-from-work/story-3Ar39ot8cGahlR5zoIJNDO.html
17-05-2020||Mumbai||Covid patient made to pay ₹24K for ambulance ride||It’s not only difficult to get tested for Covid-19 or find a hospital bed in the city, but also to avail a ride to a hospital. A 55-year-old Covid-positive woman from Worli Koliwada had to cough up ₹24,000 just to reach a hospital on May 9. She was first charged ₹12,000 for a ride from Worli to Powai and another ₹12,000 for a ride to go to Masina hospital in Byculla after she failed to get a bed in the Powai hospital. Several other patients have also complained of similar fleecing by ambulance operators.The son of the 55-year-old Covid-19 patient, said, “They [ambulance services] were very reluctant to reduce the charges and instead kept on increasing it. We had no other option and were compelled to agree to the charges. These people are taking advantage of the patients since there is no other option available during this lockdown.”While the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation has also included a free ambulance service for Covid patients on its helpline 1916, some complained that the ambulance was not made available despite calling on the helpline.Another Covid-19 patient from Kurla had to take a loan to pay for the ambulance service. A 43-year-old male from Kurla was charged ₹13,000 by an ambulance service for a ride from Kurla to Kandivli.He said, “After I was tested positive, I called up the BMC helpline and got a bed reserved at a Kandivli hospital. The BMC did not help me with an ambulance. I cannot afford to pay such a huge amount and had to take a loan of ₹13,000 to pay for the private ambulance service.” BMC officials say that the citizens should get in touch with the local police station and local ward office during such emergencies. They said that control rooms in the local ward office are already helping people with ambulances and other such issues.Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner (health), said, “Every citizen should have the contact details of local ward office and local police station. We have been promoting the local ward office control room’s number. Every administrative ward has at least three ambulances and by next week, we are getting an additional 250 ambulances which will increase the capacity of every ward.”Mohommad Abid Khan, the spokesperson of a city-based private ambulance service BSIDEU, said, “We have doubled up the salaries of our drivers and helpers on the ambulance who are willing to work during the lockdown. The ambulance staff is also given a place to stay by our company and all such cost is paid by the company. Along with this, we are also paying for PPE kits and sanitisation of the ambulances on a daily basis. This is why the cost of the ambulance escalates.”“Having said that, we continue to give free rides for cases that come through our NGOs and we also help the patient to find a bed in the hospitals,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-patient-made-to-pay-24k-for-ambulance-ride/story-VnfpICBGJPKyfL5bCbsyaN.html

It is being done for the first time and the board is presently working on the tendering process for roping in a firm for mapping noise pollution, identifying hotspots and preparing a plan for controlling noise pollution. The board officials said the PPCB had already been measuring noise pollution, but it was done on specific occasions such as Diwali, etc, or when the board received a complaint against any factory. As Ludhiana is an industrial hub, rising noise pollution has been a major concern for residents with lakhs of vehicles moving on city roads. Under the new project, hotspots would be identified and a comprehensive report prepared after conducting a survey for dealing with noise pollution in both the cities.PPCB member secretary Krunesh Garg said, “The project will be initiated at the ground level soon and the board is currently working on the tendering process for roping in a firm. Noise pollution mapping has not been done in the cities in the past and after dealing with the problem in these two cities, the board would cover other cities in the state.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ppcb-to-map-and-mitigate-noise-pollution-in-ludhiana-amritsar/story-woKgGgihMjcIac4xX8jusL.html

She said she received a link, in which she was asked to fill her bank details to avail financial help of Rs 15,000 from the government.She added she and her family members filled the forms, but she suspecting something fishy, lodged a complaint with the police.The fraudsters are using pictures of the Prime Minister to trap the people. The police have detected four such fake websites and initiated an investigation to trace the operators.Information technology expert and chief executive officer (CEO) of Cyber Frame Solutions Anoop Gupta said, “Fraudsters resort to dupe people through various mediums.

17-05-2020||Noida||With doors open for export of non-surgical masks, Noida’s garment industry gets its hopes high||Bringing cheer to the garment industry in Gautam Budh Nagar, the central government on Saturday has for the first time eased the restrictions on the export of non-surgical and non-medical masks. The directorate general of foreign trade in the Union ministry of commerce and industry issued a notification on Saturday lifting the prohibition on export of non-surgical and non-medical masks of all types, including silk, wool and knitted ones.Lalit Thukral, president, Noida Apparel Export Cluster (NAEC), said after amending the export policy for masks and providing them five different ITC-HS codes, the garment manufacturers of GB Nagar are expected to make at least one lakh masks per day. In India, eight-digit ITC-HS(Indian trade clarification based on harmonized system) codes are allotted to products that are to be imported or exported.According to estimates, the district hosts more than 3,000 garment factories which employ around 15 lakh workers. The garment industry is the second-biggest sector in the state after agriculture in terms of the number of people it engages.“Garment factories will not have any dearth of raw materials as many leftover fabrics, including cotton, silk, wool, polyester among others, can be used for making masks. This decision to allow export of non-medical masks will not only give a new lease of life to the garment industry in Noida which had suffered a huge loss caused by nationwide lockdown due to Covid-19, but will also pave a new way in the export domain,” he said. Most of the garment industries only resumed limited operations in the first week of May after the lockdown restrictions were eased in the country. While the garment units are allowed to operate with 30% percent workforce, industry owners have been battling a shortage of workers as many of them have returned to their home towns. Thukral, who chaired a meeting of garment exporters just after the notification was released, said all the garment manufacturers are very enthusiastic and more than willing to make designer masks. “These designer masks will not only attract foreign buyers but will also provide a larger canvas to the research and design wings of the garment units,” he said.Echoing similar views, Manoj Sahu, who runs a garment export company in Noida, said that according to his personal estimates, garment units operating in the district can make at least a total of 30 lakhs masks in a month. He said going by his expectations, the garment industry in the district can generate an additional revenue of at least ₹50 crore a month. “Apart from generating additional revenue, the government’s decision will also create more jobs in the garment manufacturing sector,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/with-doors-open-for-export-of-non-surgical-masks-noida-s-garment-industry-gets-its-hopes-high/story-TIgRkiBGHJmrOpkuDqan8J.html
17-05-2020||City||Auraiya accident: SHO of Ghaziabad’s Indirapuram suspended; circle officer asked to explain||After the tragedy in Auraiya where 24 migrant workers who were travelling back home were killed in a road accident, Ghaziabad district administration and police officers have been on alert to direct people to nearby shelters.Ever since the lockdown to control the spread of Covid-19 was announced on March 24, millions of migrant workers, who are mostly daily wage earners, have been attempting to go back to their home towns and villages. While many walked great distances, others managed to get on trucks since the curbs were relaxed for the third phase of the lockdown that began on May 4. Ghaziabad, border district with Delhi, turned out to be a hotbed for migrant labourers attempting to make their way into other areas of Uttar Pradesh and even Bihar.Of late the Uttar Pradesh government had been attempting to ferry workers on buses and trains. But for those who did not get tickets or if the buses and trains did not go to their intended destination, trucks were their next option.On Saturday morning, on national highway-9, migrant workers were seen boarding trucks. However, following the chief minister’s orders, police and administrative officers started ferrying all those they could find on the road to the nearest shelters.Migrant workers like Dharmendra Kumar along with his family members were brought to Sukh Sagar Farm House, which is now turned to a shelter, in Kavi Nagar Industrial Area on Saturday afternoon.Kumar arrived from Wazirpur Industrial Areas in Delhi.“I had heard that we can get lift in truck from Ghaziabad’s Lal Kuan in order to go to our hometown, Pratapgarh in UP. My wife is six months pregnant and we have two minor children besides my old aged mother with me. At Lal Kuan we waited for trucks but could not gather courage to board as it was stuffed with other workers. My wife said that she would not be able to take up such a travel,” he said.“So we waited there for another truck or any buses but cops arrived and brought us to the shelter home in a bus,” he added.Other workers like Lalu Yadav, who is native of Mahagama in the state of Jharkhand, were also picked up by cops and taken to shelter home.“I along with 50 other construction workers were walking to NH-9 from Razapur where we work. We are sitting without work for past two months. Some of my colleagues gave an idea that we should board some truck from NH-9 to our hometown. When we reached near the highway, the cops nabbed us and brought us to the shelter home,” Yadav added.For past one week the UP State Road Transport Corporation (UPSRTC) has stepped up despatch of their buses to different parts of UP.“The buses are now going almost everyday and also as per demand. In about past week or so we have despatched about 600 buses to different parts of UP with an average seating of about 35 passengers per bus,” said AK Singh, regional manager of UPSRTC.On Saturday, divisional commissioner Anita C Meshram and inspector general (Meerut Range) Praveen Kumar, also arrived to Ghaziabad and inspected the shelters besides giving directions to local officials.“The directions are clear from the state administration that no one will be travelling afoot or by any trucks. The migrant workers will be brought to shelter homes and proper arrangement of water, food, etc. is being done. The police have been given clear instructions and any travel by truck has been stopped. They will be sent by buses or train with proper social distancing,” Meshram said.In a late night development, the SHO of the Indirapuram police station was suspended by state officials and an explanation was sought on the matter from the circle officer.Police officials said 16 migrant workers who were in the vehicle that met an accident at Auraiya had boarded the vehicle from the jurisdiction of the Indirapuram police station in Ghaziabad.“All 16 migrant workers had boarded the vehicle from Indirapuram police station area, the workers later told investigation officers. All of the 16 persons are safe. However, in light of this, officials have directed for the suspension of the Indirapuram SHO while an explanation has been sought from the circle officer of the area,” said Manish Mishra, superintendent of police (city).District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey did not respond to calls.SSP Kalanidhi Naithani said that directions are being complied with and buses have been roped in by the district officials to migrant workers to different shelters.“We are ensuring that no one travels afoot or by trucks. The migrants who are in shelter homes are sent by buses while those who have train bookings are travelling by train. With all the available resources we are trying best to secure 49 border points besides deployment over roads and hotspot areas.We are also ensuring that no accident like incident happens with any workers,” he added.Awanish Awasthi, UP’s additional chief secretary (home), said that CM has taken cognisance of the incident in Auraiya.“The instructions from CM are clear that no migrant workers should be travelling afoot or by any unsafe transport like trucks, etc. Travel by buses and trains are free of cost. The border districts have been told to take details and screen workers who arrive at borders. Every border district has been told to make arrangement for 200 buses for the purpose of their travel,” Awasthi, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/auraiya-accident-sho-of-giazbabad-s-indirapuram-suspended-circle-officer-asked-to-explain/story-lzZ5srNHh7RzyM1nCqsjJN.html

17-05-2020||City||Extend amnesty scheme till March 2021, stop migration of labourers: FICO to Punjab industry body||In view of the coronavirus lockdown’s impact over trade, the Federation of Industrial and Commercial Organisation (FICO) have asked the Punjab State Industries and Export Corporation (PSIEC) Limited to extend its amnesty scheme till March 31, 2021.The demand was raised by a FICO delegation led by their chairman KK Seth and president Gurmeet Singh Kular during a meeting with PSIEC chairman Gurpreet Gogi.FICO president Gurmeet Singh Kular said, “PSIEC Limited had announced a liberal one-year amnesty scheme applicable to the allotters of different focal points against the payment of enhanced land cost, providing facility of making payment in two equal instalments with a waiver of compounding and penal interests to the plot holders of PSIEC due on May 31. Considering the current scenario, we have requested the corporation to extend the due date till March 31, 2021. “We have also requested the industrial body to waive off the interest completely to facilitate the industry in this period of recession,” he said.The FICO leader also said, “Despite waiving off the compounded and penal interests, PSIEC is still charging 15% per annum which would raise the original enhancement of Rs 474 to Rs 1,000. It is totally enviable for the industry that is already going through a period of crunch. It is a humble request that as per the ‘No Enhancement Policy’ of the Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited, the same should be applicable in Punjab so as to facilitate the industry in the state.”The industrialists also said that under-construction units or those which could not start their production due to the curfew should also be given the extension till March 31, 2021, without penalty.‘REPAIR FOCAL POINT ROAD, SEWERAGE’The delegation also urged PSIEC chairman Gogi to give green signal to the repair and upgrading of Focal Point Road and the sewerage on it. Another demand raised by the delegation was –permission to the industrialists to utilise 30% of their land area for the construction of staff quarters for labour as well as for commercial purpose so they could construct and maintain a commercial outlet to display and sell the products manufactured in their premises.‘STOP LABOUR MIGRATION’ Meanwhile, the delegation highlighted the plight of labourers and said the state government should stop their migration to their native states. “Industry is going to face another forced lockdown in the coming days as the government of Punjab is allowing the labour to move out of the state. If this continues, the industry will go in a critical stage and its revival will be very difficult,” the attendees said.Chamber of Industrial and Commercial Undertakings president Upkar Singh Ahuja; president of Focal Point Industrial Association, Phase-8, OP Bassi; Federation of MSME Manufacturers chairman Charanjit Singh Vishwakarma and FICO general secretary Rajeev Jain were also part of the delegation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/extend-amnesty-scheme-till-march-2021-stop-migration-of-labourers-fico-to-psiec/story-H47OZJnZWAsH0usEaSlHlO.html

He, along with his associates, used to uproot ATMs from kiosks, said police.Narender Bijarnia, the superintendent of police, Nuh, said they received a tip-off about the suspect’s movement — that he would be going towards Malabh Polytechnic to meet his associates. “We deployed a crime investigation unit (CIA) team in the area and placed barricades near the college. He and his close aide, Sahid, were on their motorbike, when they saw the police and tried to take a turn in the fields. Sahid got down and ran into the fields, taking advantage of the dark, while Farookh fired four rounds at the police. One bullet hit the police vehicle,” he said.In retaliatory firing by the police, a bullet hit his right leg and he fell, the police said.Bijarnia said he was rushed to a hospital and is undergoing treatment. “During questioning, he confessed to his involvement in more than 200 incidents, in which he and his associates uprooted ATMs from eight states across the country. He allegedly stole more than ₹14 crore in the last 10 years and revealed the modus operandi of his gang,” he said.According to the police, the suspect had formed a gang to loot ATMs 10 years ago and has been arrested several times. Farookh has allegedly travelled to Gujarat, Orissa, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra.Nuh police on Saturday wrote to the officials concerned in the eight states and compiled data of the incidents reported in their cities. “There are 20 members in his gang, of whom 14 have been identified.

He used to visit a city and spend a week keeping a close watch on the ATM kiosks and how often it was loaded with the money. Once the plan was finalised, three to four gang members visited that city and planned the execution. Later, other gang members used to reach the city in different vehicles, which they used for the operation, “ he said.The police said that the gang used to target ATMs on the first night after the money was loaded in the machines. Gang members used to be deployed at both ends of the road to keep a check on the police movement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/nuh-shoot-out-man-held-for-looting-14-crore-from-200-atms-in-eight-states/story-SxKi8rgyLt0x6i8txaMA8M.html

17-05-2020||City||Students relived as CBSE announces to release date sheet for board exams||Facing uncertainty for almost two months after Central Board for Secondary Education (CBSE) postponed the board exams, students breathed a sigh of relief as the board announced to release the date sheet on Monday.On March 18, CBSE had announced that board exams of Classes 10 and 12 could not be conducted due to the Covid-19 outbreak.A week after the Centre announced that the remaining exams will be held between July 1 to 15, Union minister of human resource development (MHRD) Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank took to Twitter on Saturday evening to announce that CBSE would release the date sheet on Monday.The pending exams of Class 12 include business studies, geography, Hindi (elective and core), home science, sociology, computer science (old and new), information practice (old and new), information technology and biotechnology.Sristhi Verma, a commerce student at BCM Senior Secondary School, Basant Avenue, Dugri, welcomed the decision of conducting the remaining exams in July.“Although every student wants to be done with the exams so that he or she can go out with friends, on a trip or even starting looking for colleges, but the situation is different this time. Saving lives is more important than conducting examinations. I’m hopeful that situation will normalise by the time we appear for our pending exams,” she said, adding that computer science and business are her pending papers.Astha Munro, a humanities student at BCM School, said that she just focuses on the future by searching for good colleges to pursue fashion designing.“Though I’m left with only one exam, it is still a burden. I have already revised all the lessons many times and I’m glad that the board decided to release the date sheet. It was high time,” she said, sharing that the board had announced to postpone the papers just one day before her Punjabi exam was scheduled.Sukhpreet Kaur, another commerce student of the same school, said that she had planned to learn to play the harmonium after the exams.“I wanted to learn something new after completing the board exams, but this lockdown ruined all my plans. I could not go out for music lessons and the only thing I have been doing these days is cooking. After appearing for my remaining two exams, I won’t have much time as I will start preparing for the entrance exams for admission to universities. This announcement has ended the uncertainty. Finally, the burden of exams will be lifted from our shoulders,” she said.Paramjeet Kaur, principal BCM Arya Model Senior Secondary School and city coordinator of CBSE, said, “So far, we have not received any directions on how the exams will be conducted or what precautionary measures will be taken. We are only certain that the remaining exams will be held from July 1 to 15.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/students-cheer-as-cbse-announces-to-release-date-sheet-for-board-exams/story-4U4h4OpFa7JSyLLi1lTbZM.html
17-05-2020||Chandigarh||Tricity buzz: HT Chandigarh reporters’ tracker on all those making, or faking, news amid coronavirus lockdown||OFFICE TURNS OUT TO BE A RELAXING OUTING FOR PUNJAB GOVT STAFF IN MOHALIThere may be many a downside to the Covid-19 lockdown but there is certainly an upside for Punjab government employees in Mohali. With offices opening last Monday with 33% staff and no public dealing, employees at the municipal corporation, Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) and district administrative complex couldn’t have asked for more. With no pesky people and hardly any work besides accommodating bosses and no rush hour traffic en route, office is turning out to be a relaxing outing. It’s a nice getaway where they catch up on gossip, stretch their legs and just sit and ponder on how they would be slogging it out for eight hours at a stretch in the office just two months ago.CHANDIGARH HEALTH DEPT KEEPS JOURNALISTS GUESSINGThe Chandigarh health department is often bombarded with questions from journalists on the health beat for real-time updates on corona positive cases. The media needs to report the latest accurately but prompt updates are rare to come by in Chandigarh unlike Mohali, where deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan tweets the latest himself. UT officials tweet everything except the updated figures and at times, journalists under deadline pressure lose their cool. Once Chandigarh director, health services, Dr G Dewan posed queries on a WhatsApp group of health journalists but when it was the media’s turn to ask him questions, he went silent. It was after much hue and cry by journalists that the UT administration has started sharing data of Covid-19 cases twice a day.ITI STUDENTS MAKING MASKS FOR COVID WARRIORSWith masks a must to check the spread of Covid-19, students of Industrial Training Institute (ITI, women) are meeting the demand by stitching masks at home during the lockdown. They have stitched 25,000 masks, keeping principal Shamsher Singh Purkhalvi busy in managing the distribution among sanitation workers, labourers, police and other departments in Mohali. The institute provides the raw material to the students, while the staff is assigned the duty of collecting the masks from the homes of the students. WHAT WENT WRONG AT BAPU DHAM COLONY?A status update report of Chandigarh’s health department on May 12 states that despite the lockdown to check the spread of Covid-19, there was crowding at community water taps at Bapu Dham in violation of social distancing norms. Sharing of hookahs, cigarettes and beedis besides drinking and card playing sessions contributed to the spread of coronavirus. Poor hygiene and lack of cough etiquettes were listed as reasons that led to the infection of 121 people in the low income group locality. #MAIN BHI CHANDIGARH POLICE CAMPAIGN ON COURSEClose on the heels of the Punjab Police campaign #Main Bhi Harjeet Singh, Chandigarh Police have launched an awareness drive of their own with #Main Bhi Chandigarh Police. In the video, city residents, including children, pledge they will practise social distancing norms and ensure their family members and neighbours do so too. The police wants people to adhere to social distancing and the video goes a long way in spreading the message. COPS GOING BEYOND CALL OF DUTYAfter the Covid curbs were relaxed, traffic police personnel expanded their role by assisting the administration in providing meals to the poor and conducting awareness workshops in housing societies of Chandigarh’s southern sectors. After the recent storm, policemen at Children’s Traffic Park were seen helping clear the roads of branches. Deputy superintendent of police, road safety, Jaswinder Singh led from the front as his team removed a tree that had fallen on the road dividing Sectors 37 and 41.CHANDIGARH BIKER SPITS ON ROAD, COP MAKES HIM CLEAN ITTraffic marshal Baldev Singh was on duty at a checkpost near Tribune Chowk last Monday when he saw a biker spit on the road. The cop sent the biker back to the spot and clean the spit with a bottle of water. A video of the incident was shared widely on social media. During the lockdown, a case can be registered under Sections 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life); and 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) of the Indian Penal Code can be registered against anyone found spitting. The motorcyclist was, however, let off with a warning. SCHOOL EDUCATION DIRECTOR, DEO NOT ON THE SAME PAGEA day after director, school education, Rubinderjit Singh Brar said that school holidays have been extended for two weeks, district education officer Alka Mehta questioned the source of information. Asked for clarification, Brar said that the DEO is not wrong as per the officer order, while the information that holidays have been extended for two weeks is not wrong either. Looks like both officers are not on the same page, leaving students of government schools confused.

17-05-2020||City||HT Chandigarh Our Take: Opening schools in times of a raging pandemic||The third phase of Covid-19 lockdown ends today as India awaits another set of government announcements on steps to tackle the pandemic, with further easing of restrictions expected.Nothing, however, has been clarified about reopening schools even though there were some reports of the ministry of human resource and development (MHRD) and the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) planning to give the green signal for the new session to start.An alternative academic calendar the MHRD released earlier in May for secondary school students to cover the syllabus during the lockdown seemed to indicate that children were not likely to return to classes anytime soon as the guidelines read: “Teacher educators, teachers and parents need to find ways to deal with this unprecedented situation arising out of the lockdown in order to engage students meaningfully through educational activities at home. While we are putting in all efforts to flatten the epidemic curve, learning can continue at home too, and the learning curve of children must continue to move upwards.” The ministry had also launched an alternative calendar for primary students earlier on April 16.Involving stakeholders in making this decision, especially when Covid-19 infections in India are showing no signs of plateauing, is crucial, something that the Delhi government seems to understand as it recently asked students, teachers and principals about the roadmap to reopening schools post the lockdown. An online suggestion form has been put up on the website of the Directorate of Education, where students, their teachers, principals and parents can give their inputs, an official statement from the Delhi government said.Schools will also from now on have to undertake the gargantuan task of putting social distancing measures and health and hygiene checks in place. Other concerns revolve around accommodating 20 or even 40 children in a small room, creating additional space for them; getting more teachers and staff to cope with the increased pressure. Will more school buses be required due to the distancing norms? What about children of daily wage workers who have left for their hometowns? Who takes care of their education?That’s not all. Preventing infections in school, having additional staff and health workers on the premises to ensure adequate sanitation and to effectively screen each child will be a bigger concern.Does it seem feasible to get children out of their homes into classrooms at this juncture? Will parents allow it? What about working couples who are returning to their workplaces once government and private offices start functioning, leaving their children at home?What needs to be addressed immediately is growing concerns about the spread of Covid-19. The city and the tricity are reporting infections regularly, with a number of hotspots marked out, including Bapu Dham Colony and Sector 30. Health of children and the population is the biggest priority now, and until the cities become “green zones,” getting children out and about is not advisable.It will require a lot of brainstorming and planning to open schools – any kneejerk reaction now can have catastrophic consequences.OPENING SCHOOLSShould schools be opened after the May 17 lockdown is lifted? Is it safe to reopen schools during the Covid-19 outbreak? What steps should the government take to ensure students’ safety? Send your responses to Chandigarh@hindustantimes.com by May 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ht-chandigarh-our-take-opening-schools-in-times-of-a-raging-pandemic/story-BLU46dalswt8Xm2Ti4pg2N.html
17-05-2020||Delhi||Outstation AIIMS patients in two minds: To stay, or leave?||With little clarity from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) on when the hospital will resume services at its outpatient department (OPD), more than 500 patients and their attendants who had travelled to the Capital for treatment at the premier institute remain unsure of what they should do next.The AIIMS administration had, in the second week of May, said they were planning to resume OPD services in phases, but there has been no confirmation on the specific date.The hospital had shut all its non-emergency departments, including surgical departments and specialty clinics on March 24, a day before the nationwide lockdown came into effect, and kept only its emergency services open for non-Covid patients.Indrajeet Kumar, 25, a resident of Bihar’s Sitamarhi district who travelled to the Capital to get his father treated in early March, said they are waiting till Monday to see if OPD services resume. He said they would return home if the services stay shut.“My father uses crutches to walk and was being treated at the neurology department for a bone infection. He has high blood-sugar levels. But now, we are running out of money,” Indrajeet said.He added that he is not able to record his father’s blood sugar levels on a daily basis because the test strips cost between ₹700-1,000, which he can no longer afford.Dr DK Sharma, medical superintendent, AIIMS, said ,”We plan to resume the OPD services in several departments sometime next week, but the date is yet to be decided. We are trying to see which departments can be resumed in, as most of manpower has so far been dedicated to Covid care.” Most of the 500 people used to camp on pavements or in tents outside the hospital, the government shifted most of them to shelter homes across the city soon on May 3. A few, however, continue to sleep in the lawns at the AIIMS roundabout. Most are battling serious ailments like cancer, heart ailments, disabilities, bone and lung infections, among others. Of these, only cancer patients are able to go for treatment, with the hospital open for chemotherapy.According to Society for the Promotion of Youth and Masses (SPYM), an NGO that runs three of the Delhi government’s shelter homes here, most of the around 1,200 families that had been camping outside the hospital have left for their home towns — some after being given new dates for their treatments, others who decided to come back once the lockdown ends.The caretaker of the Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB) shelter complex near AIIMS where Kumar is staying said the home initially had 198 occupants, of which around 140 are left now. The rest have left for their home towns.“Around 20 more are planning to leave and are waiting for Monday to check if services at the hospital reopen or not,” said the caretaker, who did not wish to be named.Away from home, trapped in the city with little money and hope, occupants in the shelter have been helping each other procure medicines and other essentials. Those who have smartphones share updates about the lockdown with the rest.For many, the wait has been unending. BP Mathur, came to Delhi from Lucknow in February for his 20-year-old son’s heart surgery. The doctor was supposed to give him a date for the procedure on March 24. “I will wait till next week to get the date, so that we at least know when to return,” Mathur said.Seventeen year-old Rani is paralysed from the waist-down. Her mother, Suman Rajvanshi, said,“We have very little money left now. Shelter authorities have helped us buy essentials, as well as a wheelchair for her. We haven’t been able to see the doctor after March 18, said Suman, who came from West Bengal’s Uttar Dinajpur in March.Rajesh Kumar, executive director, SPYM, an NGO running two of these shelters, said many occupants want to go back home. “For all those who want to go, we get their Covid-19 tests done and get them registered with the government to arrange their travel back. Many have serious illnesses, while some have been given dates for much later,” Kumar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/to-stay-or-not-patients-seeking-treatment-in-aiims-unsure-of-what-to-do/story-Kzxi3FU7oXeGVLMsuQSWNM.html
17-05-2020||Delhi||45-year-old east Delhi municipality school teacher succumbs to Covid-19||A 45-year-old teacher of a primary school of East Delhi Municipal Corporation succumbed to Covid-19 last Monday (May 11), making it the fourth death of a civic body employee in the city.Earlier, two sanitation employees and one teacher had died due to Covid-19, while on duty. East civic body officials said that in the latest case, the 45-year-old teacher was “not on duty” and was in poor health. Some teachers of the civic body have been assigned job of distributing food and ration to the homeless and the underprivileged. Delhi had witnessed 9,333 cases of the virus till Saturday with 129 deaths, according to the Delhi government. East Delhi municipality spokesperson Arun Kumar said that in Saturday’s case the deceased teacher was a resident of Bhajanpura.Kumar further added that though the deceased teacher was not on Covid-19 duty but still the corporation has been taking all precautionary and preventive measures to ensure that the frontline staff is not affected by the virus. “We have provided good quality face masks, gloves and hand sanitisers to the frontline staff. We have also given gum boots to sanitation workers who are engaged with the garbage collection from containment areas,” Kumar said.“The teacher who died of Covid-19 was also suffering from a liver ailment. He used to frequently visit hospitals for treatment. He must have got the viral infection from the hospital. On May 10, he was tested Covid-19 positive and was admitted to Lok Nayak hospital where he died on May 11,” Kumar added.He said that generally teachers are “not considered” frontline workers at municipalities unless they are engaged in special duties, such as ration or food distribution at shelter homes or schools. He said that sanitation employees, DBC (domestic breeding checkers) workers and teachers engaged in ration and food distribution duty are frontline workers.“In this case, the deceased teacher was not engaged in any such duty because of his poor health. He was not on-duty. Though, he was Covid-19 positive when he died, he does not qualify for Delhi government’s Rs 1 crore ex-gratia scheme,” Kumar said.An official of north-east district administration said that since the teacher was not on duty so the threat of other staff members getting Covid-19 infection was little. The official said that contact tracing was underway and the family of the deceased teacher was under home quarantine and the area had been sanitised, he said.Earlier on May 4, a 45-year-old teacher of the North Delhi Municipal Corporation had also died of Covid-19. She was on ration distribution duty in her designated school in Jahangirpuri area. Her husband had also died of the virus on May 3.Other than these, two sanitation workers engaged with the east corporation and South Delhi Municipal Corporation had succumbed to Covid-19 on May 15 and April 25, respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/45-year-old-east-delhi-municipality-school-teacher-succumbs-to-covid-19/story-y1OjoeARCZzVdEIvJxvybO.html
17-05-2020||Delhi||Delhi records 400+ cases for three days in a row, tally crosses 9,000-mark||The number of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in Delhi rose to 9,333 on Saturday with 438 infections recorded – the third consecutive day the fresh cases were over the 400-mark in the national capital – and with six more deaths taking the toll of 129.The number of those who have recovered from the infectious disease in Delhi rose to 3,926, leaving 5,278 active infections in the city, a health bulletin released by the government showed.The development came even as the government designated two more hospitals – Batra Hospital and Cygnus Orthocare Hospital – for treating Covid-19 patients and those suspected to have contracted the pathogen, taking the total number of dedicated Covid-19 hospitals to 13.The number of containment zones in the national capital was 73, while the number of people who have been put in home quarantine was 1,983.On the six deaths added to the official tally on Saturday a senior government official said: “All these deaths did not necessarily take place in the last 24 hours. There is a gap between occurrence of deaths and final report submitted by the Death Audit Committee. The toll recorded in the health bulletin reflects cases in which the primary cause of death is found to be Covid-19 by the committee.”The committee goes through the case sheets, medical investigations, and the death summary of the deceased before classifying them as Covid-19 deaths. Till Saturday, the data showed, 130,845 individuals were tested for Covid-19 in Delhi and 2,571 were admitted in either hospitals, dedicated Covid Care Centres or quarantine centres. On Friday, a report said that Delhi witnessed 443 “Covid funerals” – including both cremations and burials – since March 14, which included confirmed Covid-19 deaths and those suspected to have been infected.On Saturday, a Delhi government official dismissed the suggestion that the number of deaths from Covid-19 could be higher than the official figure. The official said that following the Covid-19 protocol is mandatory for all funerals in the Capital pertaining to death of individuals from any respiratory ailment, kidney or heart ailment, or those with flu-like symptoms shown immediately before death, irrespective of Covid-19 tests.In March, the Delhi government issued a standard operating protocol for Covid-19 funerals. “The health minister was of the opinion that why take a chance? So, the ambit of the protocol was expanded to cover deaths beyond confirmed cases of Covid-19,” a senior official in the health minister’s office said on condition of anonymity.A senior official in the Delhi chief minister’s office said on condition of anonymity: “The Death Audit Committee follows the guidelines prescribed by the ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research) . All hospitals have been mandated to submit their death summaries to the committee within 24 hours. Death Audit Committee is an independent body which examines each of these cases. Delhi Health Bulletin reflects the figures as declared by the Committee.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/on-third-consecutive-day-with-400-cases-delhi-crosses-9-000-mark/story-gEIO4L87VJTLJbBi4ySgWP.html
17-05-2020||Delhi||15 prisoners, a warder at Delhi’s Rohini jail test positive for coronavirus||Fifteen prisoners and a jail warder of Rohini jail have tested positive for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on Saturday. Jail officials said all 16 are asymptomatic and have been sent into quarantine. A high alert has also been sounded in Tihar jail, where around 15,000 are currently lodged in different sub-jails. Rohini currently has 1,370 prisoners. Director general (prisons) Sandeep Goel said a 29-year-old prisoner was admitted to the Deen Dayal Upadhyay hospital last Sunday for a surgery. He tested positive for the virus on Wednesday, and doctors informed the prisons department immediately. The department then conducted tests on 19 prisoners and five officials, who had come in contact with the first prisoner. “Their test results came on Saturday and 15 of 19 prisoners tested positive for Covid-19. Of the five jail officials, one tested positive, while the others are negative for the infection. The inmates who have tested positive have been separated from the others. They are being kept in the isolation quarantine barracks. The head warder has been sent to home quarantine. A few other jail staff have also been sent to home quarantine,” Goel said.All 16 prisoners who have tested positive till date have been lodged in Rohini jail for more than two months. With families of prisoners barred from visiting inmates and court hearings currently being held inside the prison over video conferencing, jail officials suspect that the virus may have been spread by an asymptomatic jail official. To contain the disease, the bi-weekly visits of all family members have been cancelled until further notice. Prisoners have been allowed to use the jail’s phone to speak to their family members daily. “At the Tihar complex, all new prisoners are kept in isolation for 14 days in jail number 2, before they are shifted to other jails. We are taking all steps to prevent the spread of the Covid-19. In Rohini, none of the prisoners is new. New prisoners are only sent to isolation wards at Tihar’s sub-jail 2 for 14 days. All prisoners in Rohini’s jail 2 have been lodged there before the lockdown started. We have used the jail’s hospital to quarantine them. Contact tracing of all positive persons is on,” a senior prison official, who did not wish to be named, said. Last week the jail administration had tested three prisoners from Tihar after one of them -- a rape accused -- was found to be in contact with a woman who had tested positive for Covid-19. All three test results, however, were negative.Tihar jail officials have been on high alert after reports emerged of a rapid Covid-19 spread at Mumbai’s Arthur Road jail, where 4,000 prisoners are lodged. The spread happened within a week of the first prisoner contracting the virus, and in all, it had affected 184 prisoners and prison staff. It had also prompted the Maharashtra government to look at releasing half the prisoners in its jails to contain the spread of the disease. Tihar jail officials have also decongested the prison by releasing around 3,000 prisoners on interim bail and parole.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/15-prisoners-one-warder-at-rohini-jail-test-positive-for-covid-19-all-prisons-on-high-alert/story-iD3MzdUHg3NBNxASq09EQN.html
17-05-2020||Delhi||Crowds throng railway station in hope of catching a train home||The roads leading to the New Delhi railway station have been among the busiest in the city, with migrants from across Delhi and neighbouring states visiting the station in the hope of boarding a train home.Police and Railways officials on the ground say that in the last few days, hundreds of migrant labourers have been visiting the station to book tickets at the counters, despite the Railways accepting only e-tickets and the counters being shut. On May 12, the Railways had started 15 pairs of special passenger trains on 30 routes, to and from New Delhi, for which bookings can only be done online.The numbers have been increasing since Tuesday, after the government started passenger train services, in a step towards resuming rail services in a graded manner. A large section of the migrant workers, who are unable to get e-tickets, have been walking to the stations to try their luck at the ticket counters. Many others have left the government’s shelter homes and are walking to their villages in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, said officials.The sudden increase of visitors to the railway station has prompted the police and government authorities to reach out to them outside the station, get their Covid-19 tests conducted and help them register for the special Shramik trains. For Shramik trains, migrant workers have to register with the government and need not pay a ticket fee. Interstate bus services continue to remain shut.The government authorities on Saturday reached out to around 150 such migrant workers sitting on the pavements near the station entrances. A kiosk, with two police personnel and a district administration official, has been set up to answer queries and guide migrants on the procedure to register for train journeys. By late afternoon, at least 70 of them were ferried from the station to a screening facility in the district, after which they will be registered for Shramik Special trains and sent back home, said officials.District officials said that on Friday evening, they had shifted over 65 migrants to a thermal screening facility and then to shelter homes, to get them registered for the Shramik trains.At least 7,000 migrants have left for their home towns in Bihar and Madhya Pradesh in five Shramik trains — a special arrangement by the state governments under guidelines issued by the Union home ministry on April 29. While four trains left for Bihar, one for MP, another one left for Tamil Nadu on Saturday noon, which also included around 200 Tablighi Jamaat participants, who were recently discharged from quarantine facilities.Subhash Kumar, his wife Geeta (goes only by her first name) and his brother-in-law started from their rented accommodation in west Delhi’s Uttam Nagar at 6am, on foot, hoping to book tickets at the station. They were able to get an autorickshaw midway, at Kirti Nagar, and were dropped at the station for Rs 200 at around 9am. Till 1.30pm, the trio was waiting to regroup with three other family members, who have been stranded in different places across the city.“We have been trying to make online reservations for four days, but have failed to do so. Last night, we decided to pack up and leave for the station, and enquire about the procedure or catch a private bus from here,” said Kumar, 28, of Sultanpur in Uttar Pradesh’s Lucknow. It was only later in the day that they got to know that buses they had spotted were ferrying migrants to screening centres.In the hot afternoon, pavements outside the station were dotted with groups of people, seated with their luggage, waiting for the buses. Volunteers of a political party distributed food packets and cold drinks to the crowd.Ravi Tandon, a construction labourer, who was accompanied by his wife and two children, was sitting with his head in his hands. He said that the family had been staying at a camp near Shivaji Stadium, but have run out of money and food. “We don’t have a ticket or any money. We just walked to the station to check if we could get a train; if not, we would start our journey to Chhattisgarh on foot. Here, a policeman told us they will ferry us in buses and make arrangements for train travel,” said Tandon, who plans to tend to a small patch of family land in his home town. He said that his father is unwell and mother is not stable, healthwise.The crowd also included a group of 23 tourists from Jharkhand, who had been stuck at a hotel since March 22 and had run out of money. “We have been surviving on food distributed by the NGOs. We had taken rooms for Rs 1,000 a day. Today (Saturday), they handed us a bill of Rs 1.5 lakh, which was not even due. The NGO people helped us settle the matter. We hope to get on the buses being arranged here,” said Savita Das, one of the tourists.The deputy commissioner of police, Railways, Harendra Singh, said that migrants reaching the station are being taken to shelters for screening. “We have been doing this, but people continue to pour into the station. Arrangements have been made with the district authorities to register them for Shramik specials,” said Singh.Meanwhile, the Delhi government on Saturday also directed officials to ensure migrants do not walk on roads and railway tracks. Those doing so would be taken to the closest shelter facility, provided food and water till their travel arrangements to their home towns in special trains and buses, is arranged, as per the directive. It also asked officials to coordinate with the Railways to speed up the process of sending them to their home states.Delhi’s chief secretary Vijay Dev, in a letter on Friday, had asked nodal officer, PK Gupta, to coordinate with the Railways for running more Shramik trains, so that travel of stranded migrant workers can be expedited.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/crowds-throng-railway-station-in-hope-of-catching-a-train-home/story-ibBpsQz93eQiqeWXidFd5J.html

17-05-2020||Delhi||Burglars decamp with valuables worth Rs 12 lakhs from JNU professor’s house||A group of men broke into the house of a Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) professor inside the university campus and decamped with cash and jewellery worth around Rs 12 lakh , police said on Saturday. This is the second burglary case reported from within the campus, which is guarded by over 250 private security guards round-the-clock, in a fortnight. Police suspect both the cases to be the handiwork of the same gang.Currently, the entry of outsiders in the campus is restricted because the university are closed. The first incident, police said, had taken place at the government-allotted residence of an Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer in the first week of May. That incident had come to light when a neighbour of the officer — currently posted in Himachal Pradesh — had noticed the break-in and informed him. The officer then filed a police complaint,.Two FIRs have been registered at the Vasant Kunj (north) police station in both the incidents, but no breakthrough had been made in either case till Saturday. “We have registered a house breaking and burglary case under Sections 457 and 380 of Indian Penal Code, against unknown people. Multiple teams are working to crack the cases,” said deputy commissioner of police (south-west) Devender Arya.On the latest break-in, a senior police officer on the condition of anonymity, said that the crime came to their notice on Thursday night after Avijit Pathak, professor in The Centre for the Study of Social Systems (CSSS) of JNU, filed a complaint.Contacted, Pathak questioned the security at the varsity and said that the security guards never allow any teacher or student to enter the campus without proper verification. But when it comes to securing the housing complex, they do nothing. “I have been teaching and living on the campus for the last 30 years and have never faced any such crime. I am surprised that despite the heavy deployment of security guards, the burglars could easily break into my house and flee with cash, jewellery and other valuables,” said Pathak.Pathak in his complaint said that due to the ongoing lockdown, he had locked and left his residence on March 20 to go stay with his daughter, who lives living in nearby Munirka. On May 14 (Thursday), Pathak’s neighbour informed him on phone that the rear door of his house was open.“The professor reached the campus with his daughter and found the rear entrance of his residence broken. They went inside and found the house burgled and household items scattered on the floor. Initially, the professor was not sure what all items were missing. Later, he gave a list of missing cash, jewellery and other valuables, worth around Rs 12 lakh,” said the officer.Another officer, who is part of the investigating team, said crime scene investigation experts visited the professor’s house. After examining the crime scene, they figured that the gang,which had burgled the IAS officer’s house earlier, could be involved, as the modus operandi was similar.“In both the cases, the suspects entered the house after breaking the rear door. The distance between the two houses is approximately 400 metres. We can’t rule out the role of someone from within the campus . The possibility of outsiders gaining entry is also being probed,” said the officer, adding that cash and jewellery worth around Rs 10 lakh had been stolen from the IAS officer’s locked house.In 2016, the police had arrested three members of a gang that had committed a series of burglaries at JNU housing complex. The investigating teams in the latest cases are probing if the arrested burglars are out of jail and are again striking locked houses on the campus, where no CCTV cameras are installed .The station house officer (SHO) of the Vasant Kunj North police station has written a letter to the JNU administration, asking them to increase vigil on campus and intensify patrolling by private security guardss.A senior JNU administration official, who did not want to be named, said, “ The university takes security issues very seriously and patrolling happens regularly. We also issue circulars stating that if people leave the campus, they should inform the security office. This did not happen in both the cases. We are cooperating with the police in the investigation,” said||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/gang-breaks-into-jnu-professor-s-house-decamp-with-cash-valuable-worth-rs-12l/story-GBTrJ9z1PHXji8uhRVAXfJ.html
17-05-2020||City||Jewellers see no bright future in Ludhiana post lockdown||With the jewellery sector already reeling under losses due to lockdown, the exodus of the skilled labour from the state has added to the woes of jewellers in the city.The jewellers rued they were already facing an uncertain future due to the shortage of funds with residents and, with the non-availability of skilled labour, they would also be unable to fulfil the orders for the marriages to take place during the next 2-3 months. Skilled labour of Maharshatra, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh has no work as shops have been closed since March 22.President of the Ludhiana Swarnkar Sangh Prince Babbar said, “The labourers have started their journey back home amid lockdown. If the skilled labour making jewellery moved out of the state, the jewellery business would nosedive and face heavy losses. However, we are seeking permission to open our shops as maintaining social distancing is no problem at jewellery stores due to less footfall of customers.”Babbar said they submitted a memorandum with assistant commissioner of police (ACP) Waryam Singh on Friday seeking permission to open their shops and were now planning to meet deputy commissioner (DC) Pradeep Agrawal as jewellery shops in nearby tehsil areas have opened. There are around 400 shops, including wholesalers, in the Sarafa Bazar and nearby areas. A jeweller in Sarafa Bazar, Tribhuvan Thapar, said, “We are facing an uncertain future and, viewing the present trend of very few farmers turning up for purchasing jewellery after the harvesting season, it is unlikely that business would pick up immediately after the lockdown ends. The limited number of guests during marriages would also have effect on our sales.” The jewellers are also concerned over the rising prices of gold in the market. The price per 10gm has crossed the 47,000 mark, which was around Rs 38,000 when lockdown was announced.President, Ludhiana Jewellers Association, Anand Sikri, said, “Our future is uncertain as gold is a luxury and post-lockdown, everyone would prefer to purchasing necessities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jewellers-see-no-bright-business-future-in-ludhiana-even-after-lockdown/story-yREHYs3JlXmiMx7UxLuMKO.html

These exams will be in the written format and will be held from July 1 to July 31.According to the SPPU director incharge, evaluation and examination, Arvind Shaligram, the university received a letter from the state government to conduct exams for final year students.“After deliberations with the board of deans and professors, we will be holding written exams in July for final year students across all faculties,” Shaligram said.The exam will be conducted in a batchwise format, wherein a total of 2,50,000 students will appear for an average of seven to eight papers. In addition, those having backlog in the final year will also be appearing for their exams.“We have collated all the data, the availability of the number of classes in colleges which will help decide upon the available infrastructure for the seating arrangement,” Shaligram said. The decision to hold a written exam against that of an online exam was done as the evaluation of these exams has not proven sanctity of 100 per cent result in multiple-choice questions, according to Shaligram.The other factor that went against online exams was that many students are not tech-savvy, or they are located in places where connectivity is an issue. “We are also in the process of discussing the exam pattern with the faculties and will soon upload the exam timetable,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/sppu-to-hold-written-exams-in-july-for-final-year-students/story-KViaf1VaHv8qQ0GKhFkWNP.html

The family members watched him lose consciousness as they sat waiting for an ambulance for hours. As the ambulance failed to come, the still body of Yeshudas Moti Francis, 54, was loaded onto a vegetable carrier tempo stopped by the police around 4am.“Type 1 respiratory failure with bilateral pneumonitis in case of hypertension,” reads the ‘cause of death’ section of the death report provided by Sassoon General Hospital. “He had suffered a relapse of hernia after 7-8 years, had blood pressure condition, and faced difficulty in walking without support,” recalls his wife Shobha Francies, also in her 50s. The deceased man had been bedridden for most days over the past 7 years owing to the hernia operation followed by blood pressure. Before that he used to sell flowers near a local dargah.Max Yeshudas Francis, 23, limped outside the narrow lane of his house as his mother called for him outside their house in part of Nana peth located off Jawaharlal Nehru road. He had acquired the job of office boy at a private company only a month before the lockdown was announced.“Around 12:30am, he called me and asked me to take him to the public toilet that we use. As he came out, he lost control of his body completely and fell on me. Everyone gathered around and took him outside and started calling for help,” said Max.The 23-year-old had twisted his ankle as he had spent the previous night pulling the near-limp body of his father out of the narrow lane.The neighbours managed to open the tin-sheet containment seal installed by the police and set a chair for him while waiting for an ambulance. What they did not know was that the wait was going to be for around four hours. “He was barely moving when we got there around 1am. We stopped two ambulances passing by, but one said there was no doctor on-board and second one said they had another call to attend. We asked a local tempo owner who also refused. Meanwhile, continuous follow-ups were happening with the 108 helpline. Finally, they said either one from Wadgaonsheri or Katraj will come after two-hours. Even that did not arrive. We tried a rickshaw too but he had hernia and could not fit in due to the swollen stomach. So, at 4am we stopped a vegetable tempo driver who agreed to take him,” said Hawaldar Deepak Tatey of Samarth police station who assisted the family along with Hawaldar Dhanaji Gophane. “We tried to call private ambulances. We also tried to call the doctor who treats him regularly. He was standing upstairs, but refused to come down and help. The first ambulance driver assigned by 108 was from Kondhwa and said if he comes, he will not touch the man. After some time, as he did not show up, we asked again and he flatly refused to come,” said Sudhir Dhawale, a local social worker who was present with the family.This is not the first incident of ambulance delay or refusal from the area. In the past two months the response time of the ambulances has gone up to 4-5 hours, according to senior police inspector Balkrushna Kadam of Samarth police station. “They ask for bed-confirmation from patients before coming. This has become a regular issue now. People in emergency situations call for 108 ambulances and they do not show up for hours on end,” said PI Kadam.The family has buried the man in Hadapsar cemetery.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/54-year-old-dies-waiting-for-an-ambulance-in-pune/story-MsLNZdAaMRR1clQdLqnDwM.html
17-05-2020||Pune||Rs 31.83 crore spent to combat Covid-19; focus on improving health budget: Pune civic chief||The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has spent at least Rs 31.83 crore in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, this expenditure includes setting up of Covid-19 care centres, cleaning and maintenance, patient-related expenditure in hospitals and also food expenses related to patients and quarantined citizens.With an increasing number of Covid-19 cases rising on a daily basis, the civic body is now looking at strengthening the health budget in the next five years to strengthen the overall health infrastructure in the city.According to Pune municipal commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad, the civic body will henceforth, prioritise health budget over other less important projects at least for the next five years. “The civic body has spent about Rs 31.83 crore as of yet, which is only the actual amount spent, this number may go up to Rs 60 crore if the bills are disbursed and the amount is settled,” Gaikwad said.“We have incurred a huge expenditure and are spending almost Rs 200 per day per person on food and so for 14 days, this cost becomes around Rs 2,800 per person. This is for all those isolated and undergoing treatment at hospitals and also those who are quarantined. This is a huge expenditure especially considering that there is reduced income,” he addedGaikwad believes that the central government must come up with a directive enforcing all municipal councils and corporations to reserve at least 5 to 10 per cent of their annual budget especially for health in strengthening government hospitals.“I cannot give an exact figure as of now, but at the time of preparing the budget, we will keep these things in mind. Medical equipment like ventilators, ICU facilities, and better hospital infrastructure is expensive. We may have to prioritise health and postpone less important projects like gardens or minor ward level works,” Gaikwad said.The civic body has spent about Rs 31 crore as of yet only for Covid-19 since the first case was detected on March 9. A maximum chunk of this amount has been spent on treatment at hospitals (Rs 10 crore), followed by Rs 7 crore on purchases made by the central department which includes personal protection equipment (PPE) kits, masks, oxygen pipelines, medical equipment and instruments.The cleaning and maintenance of Covid-19 care centres has cost Rs 4 crore and Rs 3 crore has been spent on electrical equipment. The food expenses related to patients and quarantined citizens has also cost Rs 4 crore.In addition, the civic body has proposed 12 lakh cotton masks and a work order has been issued, 3.89 lakh cotton masks have already been distributed. The recruitment of doctors and paramedical staff is in process and a total of 1,017 applications have been received out of which scrutiny process is completed and 497 candidates will be recruited for a period of three months. From the mayor’s funds, as of May 15, medical equipment and instruments along with medicines of worth Rs 56 lakh for Covid-19 patients has been purchased, cold fogging machines and spraying pumps worth Rs 35 lakh has been purchased for spraying of sodium hypochlorite in the vicinity of positive cases.An oxygen pipeline and industrial washing machine has also been installed at Naidu Hospital to support patients, building modifications and maintenance work of various quarantine centres and Covid-19 care centres is being done on an emergency basis.N-95 masks, PPE Kits and sanitisers worth Rs 63 lakh have been purchased and under DPDC pulse oxymeter, thermometers, PPE kits, N-95 masks, thermal guns worth Rs. 1 crore have been procured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rs-31-83-crore-spent-to-combat-covid-19-focus-on-improving-health-budget-pune-civic-chief/story-6dYzis1nifKOxhSZxHcjhO.html
17-05-2020||Delhi||Curbs relaxed or not, Delhi’s Chandni Chowk to stay shut till May 31||The Capital’s iconic Chandni Chowk market will stay shut till May 31, the traders union said on Saturday. The move comes at a time when the Delhi government is exploring ways to reopen markets in the city that have been shuttered since the national lockdown to curb the spread of Covid-19 was imposed on March 25. Sanjay Bhargava, president Chandni Chowk Sarva Vyapar Mandal, said the decision was taken for the “greater good”. “Chandni Chowk is one of the busiest markets of the city. Social distancing is almost impossible because of the paucity of space. So, we have decided to extend lockdown in the market till May 31 in view of high number of cases being reported in Delhi. It is for the security and safety of traders, their staff and general public. By the end of May, the graph of Covid-19 is also expected to go down a bit,” Bhargava said.Delhi had recorded 9,333 cases of the virus till Saturday, with 129 deaths, according to the Delhi government. The Mughal-era market is one of the biggest textile and cloth markets in the city. As per the traders’ association estimates, around a lakh people visited the market every day between October 2019 and March 2020. The third phase of the national lockdown will come to an end on May 17 and is expected to continue with more relaxations as far as the movement of people and vehicles and opening of businesses are concerned. Though an official order to open markets in the city is yet to be issued, the Delhi government asked the Centre that markets in the Capital be allowed to open on an ‘odd-even’ basis from May 18 onwards. Chandni Chowk falls in the central Delhi district, and is close to many containment zones such as Chandni Mahal, Nabi Karim, Sadar Bazar, and Ballimaran. The district has reported at least over 100 positive cases so far.Ram Mehrotra, a local businessman,said the market has become more crowded ever since the Chandni Chowk redevelopment project began in December 2018. Work was to be completed in June 2019 but was extended to March 2020. The main road between Red Fort and Fatehpuri Masjid has been dug up under the redevelopment project, which aims to decongest the market and make it pedestrian-friendly. “The situation got worse over the last festival season, with over one lakh people visiting the market a day. If the market is opened again, social distancing norms will be hard to follow. So it’s better if we keep it closed for 15 more days and open it when a concrete plan is in place,” Mehrotra said.The market association has also requested the Central as well as the Delhi government to release SOPs (standard operating procedure) for all the markets across the city at least 10 days before lifting the lockdown. “The government should very clearly tell us about the ‘dos and don’t’ before opening of the markets. The ways to maintain social distancing and minimise crowding should also be specifically mentioned,” Bhargava said.Meanwhile, market associations across the city have started drafting their own SOPs in the hope the government will allow markets to open from May 18. Devraj Baweja, member Sadar Bazar Market Association, said, “We are yet to get any directive on reopening of markets but we are mulling how to ensure social distancing. Not more than two people will be allowed in a shop at a time, thermal screening will be mandatory and we will make circles outside shops, at distances of at least one metre,” he said.Ashwani Marwah, general secretary Traders Association Lajpat Nagar (TALN) said the market association would ensure all visitors follow social distancing norms and that customers are screened before entering shops.Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung Hospital, welcomed the decision and called it an example of community participation in combating a crisis.“Opening of markets is necessary but maintaining social distancing and ensuring that virus does not spread is a responsibility to be shouldered by the government and the community. Chandni Chowk is more crowded than any other market in the city so it’s fine to wait for some time before opening it up,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandni-chowk-to-stay-shut-till-may-31-says-traders-union/story-P0niD9SZ9I6HSH9XzqbGgN.html

We will follow the guidelines issued by the Centre and state governments for adding additional relaxations,” said Gaikwad.The PMC commissioner had identified 69 sites within the PMC limits to having more number of Covid-19 cases and had imposed stricter lockdown measures while in the other areas, they had relaxed the lockdown allowing the opening of shops and opening of roads. “We have on average visited 50,000 houses in the past two months, and visited 1.5 lakh, people, daily,” he added.“With the festival season around, we will ensure that people from containment zones will receive the supply of essential items, food and medicines, with 3.1 per cent of the area being under strict lockdown,” said Gaikwad.“The rate doubling of cases has increased to 13 days now while the death rate has dropped to 5.18 per cent, which is still more than the state and national average, but we are expecting a further drop in the next two weeks”, said Gaikwad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/govt-private-offices-in-pune-likely-to-open-post-may-18-civic-chief/story-CtGfMpNbzwMcYK0Et7cjFO.html
17-05-2020||City||Three held for making extortion calls to potato trader in Ludhiana||Three men have been arrested for making extortion calls to a Giaspura-based potato trader, police said on Saturday. The accused allegedly demanded Rs 2 lakh from the trader, Santosh Kumar, of Makkar Colony, Giaspura, and threatened him that they would harm his family members if he failed to pay up. They even vandalised the window pane of his car parked outside his house.The trio has been identified as Sukhdev Singh alias Sonu of Arjan Nagar, Daresi, Surjit Singh alias Vicky of Mohalla Nanak Nagar and Bajrangi of Karabara. One of their accomplices, Pawan Kumar, is yet to be arrested.Additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP, city 2), Jaskiranjit Singh Teja, said that Santosh made a complaint to them on Friday, stating that he had been receiving extortion calls from an unknown number for the past few days. “Initially, he took the calls lightly and did not inform us until the accused damaged the window pane of his car. Earlier, he assumed that someone was trying to play a prank on him,” the ADCP (city 2) said.ACCUSED WORKED IN MANDI VISITED BY VICTIM DAILYThe accused are known to the trader as they work in the potato mandi where he visits daily for business. The trader looked like an easy target to the trio following which they plotted the plan, the policeman said.A case has been registered under Sections 384 (punishment for extortion), 427 (whoever commits mischief and thereby causes loss or damage to the amount of fifty rupees or upwards), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code at Sahnewal police station.

The building is part of the six building complex and has been declared as a containment zone with no entry or exit allowed, said officials.​According to officials, the cases were detected between May 14 and May 16. Around 400 swabs have collected as of Saturday. ​According to PMC commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad with these fresh cases, the civic body will soon decide whether to announce the area surrounding the building as an additional micro-containment zone.“We have found a large number of cases from a single building at Manjul Bai chawl. Currently, we have about 69 containment zones in the city and we will decide whether to announce it as an additional containment zone or merge into the nearby ones at Bhawani peth or DP road ward areas,” said Gaikwad. The building comes under Dhole Patil road ward and has become a new challenge for the authorities. The female sanitation worker, who was the primary source of infection, has been admitted to the hospital where she was working. The area was inspected by Saurabh Rao, nodal officer for the area and also by Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol. ​Dhole Patil road ward officer Dayanand Sonkamble said, “With the help of police and also daily rations kits being provided, we hope to ensure that the suspected patients remain inside their homes for at least 7-10 days. The woman probably had symptoms for a few days, but continued going to work which led to an escalation in the spread of the virus.”Currently the entire complex of six buildings has been sealed and the positive patients are being shifted to the Nicmar isolation facility at Aundh. The suspected patients are being quarantined in a vacant building of the same complex and the negative patients are being sent home for quarantine, said officials.​||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/bhavani-peth-adds-to-pmc-s-virus-burden-after-building-reports-35-covid-19-cases/story-T863x7hh56qywiIjpswVFO.html
17-05-2020||Pune||Former Maha CM Chavan slams Centre, state govt for failing to address issues of migrants||Former Maharashtra chief minister and senior congressman Prithviraj Chavan pointed out the shortcomings of the Maharashtra government as well as the Centre in its fight against Covid-19 and handling of the migrant workers issue.Chavan, while speaking to journalists through a video conference on Saturday, said both the Centre and state government have failed to ensure smooth return of migrants. Chavan’s Congress party is part of the Maha Vikas Aghadi government of which the Shiv Sena and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) are the other two key players.Reacting to a query on the exodus of the migrant labourers from the state, Chavan alleged that both the Centre and the Maharashtra government have been ‘frugal’ in refusing to spend money in taking the migrants back home.“I feel that there was a major shortcoming on the part of the Centre and the state government regarding the way we are treating the migrant workers and not spending money on them. It was our human responsibility to send the migrant workers back to their states and we have failed in it completely,” Chavan said, adding that with migrants gone, a labour shortage crisis might soon occur. The former chief minister said that there is a need to create dedicated accommodation facilities for labourers. Large number of migrant workers had to leave for their respective states on feet or through private vehicles as the Centre and state did not initially organise public transport. It was after the first week of May that the railway ministry organised special trains while the state government allowed state transport buses for labourers.Chavan also advised chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to assert leadership in ensuring efficient working from bureaucrats.“I have a suggestion for the chief minister and he should take it positively without seeing it as criticism. The chief minister’s important task is to appoint right persons at the right place especially when there is inconsistency in the implementation of government orders. This is mostly because power has been given to sub-divisional officers, district collectors and divisional commissioners,” said Chavan while addressing a query on lack of coordination between various officials and absence of leadership in Maharashtra. “Currently there are around 10 senior IAS officers who have no work. On the contrary, there are officers handling the charge of two different ministries. So, the chief minister should issue an order and fill up these posts in one day. After giving them regular appointments, they can be given other responsibilities,” said Chavan.Chavan pointed out that the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation is sitting on ample money; the leadership there is not in a position to use it properly. “BMC has thousands of crores in the bank and the money can be utilised in boosting local infrastructure. But the leadership there is unable to do it properly,” Chavan said, when asked about his view of BMC keeping large a sum in the bank as fixed deposits. It was Chavan who had last week advised the Centre to take back gold from temples to mitigate a financial crisis, a suggestion that evoked sharp responses from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).Chavan also expressed his disappointment over the announcements made by Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman in terms of Rs 20 lakh crore stimulus package.“The main challenge we have is how to bring the economy back on track, how to turn the wheels of the economy. I welcome the stimulus package announced by the central government, but after listening to the announcements made by the finance minister, I’m disappointed,” Chavan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/fmr-maha-cm-chavan-slams-centre-state-govt-for-failing-to-address-issues-of-migrants/story-zkaOae46FyloAcbEdKuVqO.html

Wuhan kicked off a campaign on May 14 to look for asymptomatic carriers - people who are infected but show no outward sign of illness - after confirming last weekend its first cluster of COVID-19 infections since its release from a virtual lockdown on April 8. The number of tests carried out on May 16 in the city of 11 million residents was more than the 186,400 tests conducted on May 14-15, and was also the highest since the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission started publishing the data on Feb. 21.Wuhan is conducting the testing on a voluntary basis. Residents who were previously tested do not need to participate in the campaign.

The man is also the father of the dead child.It was the latest attack on civilians in the fighting over Tripoli between eastern-based forces under military commander Khalifa Hifter and an array of militias loosely allied with the U.N.-supported but weak government in the capital.A fire broke out in parts of the shelter housing people displaced by previous clashes in Tripoli, Merset said.The ambulance services did not say which side was responsible for the shelling.The self-styled Libyan Arab Armed Forces, led by Hifter, launched an offensive to take Tripoli in April last year. In recent weeks, the fighting has intensified as foreign backers of the two sides stepped up their military support.Hifter is backed by France and Russia, as well as Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and other key Arab countries. The Tripoli-allied militias are aided by Turkey, which deployed troops and mercenaries to help shore up their allies earlier this year, as well as by Italy and Qatar. Mercenaries, mainly from the Syria battlefield, are now fighting on both sides and complicating an already complex proxy war.Earlier this year, Tripoli-allied militias took several western towns from Hifter’s forces and stepped up their attacks using drones supplied by Turkey on a key military base and the town of Tarhuna.Hifter’s LAAF said Saturday it shot down a Turkish drone that was trying to attack the al-Watiya airbase. The Tripoli-allied militias claimed they destroyed a Russian-made anti-aircraft system, a claim dismissed by the LAAF.Libya has been in turmoil since 2011, when a civil war toppled and later killed long-time dictator Moammar Gadhafi. The country has since split between rival administrations in the east and the west, each backed by armed groups and foreign countries.The Tripoli fighting has threatened to push Libya into a major conflagration on the scale of the 2011 civil war.(AP) RUP RUP||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bombs-kill-7-in-shelter-for-displaced-in-libya-officials/story-Zfgu1mo8qiDEmyz6TXLHAJ.html

Of the total cases, 86 patients were being treated.The deadly virus has claimed 4,634 lives in the country, the NHC said.Understanding is growing of the effects of the novel coronavirus on the organs of patients, even after they apparently recover.While most patients, especially those with mild and moderate symptoms, can recover without long-term consequences to their health, studies indicated that those with severe symptoms can have organ damage and require a much longer time for rehabilitation, the report said.The NHC said some COVID-19 patients might also develop heart problems such as angina and arrhythmia – conditions that could result directly from the virus or arise after a patient has been bedridden for a long time.The guidelines also list potential mental health problems resulting from COVID-19, including depression, insomnia, eating disorders and various changes in cognitive functions. Other problems identified in the guidelines include muscle and limb-function loss, the Post reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-can-cause-long-term-organ-damage-china-adds-after-effects-to-medical-insurance/story-HyIeltjEWDgRfN1DZpncSK.html

17-05-2020||World||Lockdown fatigue spreads quicker than the Coronavirus in Africa||Two months after most African nations closed their borders and imposed lockdowns to contain the spread of the coronavirus, they’re deciding it’s not worth the economic cost.Countries began shutting their economies soon after the first case was detected in Nigeria in February and before the disease started to take hold on the continent. That helped keep Africa’s reported case count well below 80,000 out of a population of some 1.2 billion people. But as the pandemic risks dragging them into the worst economic recession on record, governments from Ghana in the west to Rwanda in the east have started to ease restrictions.Faced with an impossible dilemma -- starvation and deepening poverty or a wider outbreak -- many leaders are opting to save people’s livelihoods.“Africa is now victim of its success,” said Nana Poku, a political economist and vice chancellor of the University of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa. “Thanks to a strong public-health response, we have kept the number of infections and deaths relatively low. Compared to those numbers, the economic cost of Covid-19 in terms of lost output and increased poverty seems very large.”The first country in sub-Saharan Africa to ban travelers from high-risk countries, Ghana also led the way in easing curbs when it lifted its 21-day lockdown on April 20. Even though the number of confirmed cases subsequently increased five-fold after the easing, the situation had become financially untenable in a country where the informal economy accounts for 90% of employment, the government said.“We can’t stop economic activity in our country, our social lives, our children’s education, so we need to do something that will enable us to live our normal lives,” Health Minister Kwaku Agyeman-Manu said May 14. “We should begin to accept the fact that the disease will be with us for a while.”Rich FluGhana’s neighbors are following suit. Ivory Coast on Friday began lifting a curfew in its biggest city, Abidjan, allowing restaurants and bars that play an outsized cultural role, similar to those in France, to reopen immediately. Mosques and churches are being allowed to receive worshipers again from this weekend in Burkina Faso, where many people see Covid-19 as a flu that mainly affects the rich and adherence to restrictions is low.In Nigeria, a five-week lockdown of the two main cities was only half-heartedly observed, with traffic jams and crowded streets persisting. Exasperated by dense queues at banks and residents venturing outside without face masks, the governor of Lagos warned this week that a new lockdown may be imposed if people continue to flout public-health guidelines.As many as 190,000 people could die of Covid-19 and 44 million could be infected in Africa in the first year of the pandemic if containment measures fail, according to the World Health Organization. The body has urged a gradual easing of lockdowns to avoid a surge in infections.Gradual Approach“Containment measures, which include contact tracing, isolation, improved personal hygiene practices and physical distancing aim to slow down the transmission of the virus so its effects happen at a rate manageable by the health system,” the WHO said May 7. “Physical distancing is not about the confinement of people, but rather avoiding unnecessary contacts as people live, work and socialize as a means to interrupt transmission.”In South Africa, which has the continent’s highest number of confirmed infections, the government is taking the gradual approach -- on May 1 it began relaxing one of the world’s strictest lockdowns in place since March 27.But with thousands of small businesses at risk of collapse and the central bank expecting the economy to shrink 6.1% this year, business leaders and mining companies are asking the government to reconsider its rules and accelerate the easing of restrictions.The country’s largest platinum miner, Sibanye Stillwater Ltd., urged President Cyril Ramaphosa this week to let mines run at full capacity in order to avoid a complete shut-down. Even though miners have been allowed to restart operations with half their normal workers, that isn’t sufficient, Chief Executive Officer Neal Froneman said.“We are causing more harm by constraining the economy than we are impacting positively on Covid-19,” he said. “We have gone too far now, we now need to get the economy to start up.”The real emergency may not be the virus, but the fallout from the pandemic, said Leena Koni Hoffmann, associate fellow of the Africa program at Chatham House in the U.K.“Tens of millions of people across the continent were already in vulnerable situations before this,” she said. “The cure for the pandemic, especially in African economies, is worse than the virus itself.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lockdown-fatigue-spreads-quicker-than-the-coronavirus-in-africa/story-WhpwFDB4zWVrUHAItf9UVK.html
17-05-2020||World||Covid-19 could mean the end of small charities||Non-profit groups in the U.S. and other countries could shutter operations entirely as a result of the coronavirus, even as billions of dollars are donated to pandemic-relief efforts.Many local non-profits that count on small donors are in trouble, said Rick Cohen, chief operating officer of the U.S.-based National Council of Nonprofits. Canceled events, a sudden withdrawal of government financing and the forced closure of stores that were sources of revenue have led to a depletion of funds, he said.Charitable organizations around the world have suffered in recent months with income and fundraising streams drying up as tens of millions of people lost their jobs or faced greater financial difficulty. The London Marathon, for instance, raised 66 million pounds ($80 million) for various U.K. charities in 2019, but this year’s run that was scheduled for April has been postponed.“Nonprofits are facing devastation right now,” Cohen said in an email. “Some are facing skyrocketing demands for their services, others are seeing funding dry up, and some are seeing both at the same time.”Tracking Gifts, Donations Made to Fight Coronavirus: Bloomberg TrackerAbout 53% of donors said they plan to be giving more carefully during the pandemic but will continue to still donate, while 20% said they will stop until there’s a return to economic growth, according to a survey carried out for Dunham+Company.The rest said they would keep on giving, the survey showed, citing the sentiment is stronger among donors who frequent religious services at least weekly.“The oldest donors, regular churchgoers, and self-described conservative donors were significantly more likely to say their giving would remain unchanged compared to younger donors, less frequent churchgoers, and liberal donors,” according to Dunham.Ramadan EffectDonating to charity is ingrained in the Islamic month of Ramadan, and much of this is typically raised through collection boxes at mosques, gala dinners and other fundraising methods, as many Muslims attend nightly prayers at their local places of worship. But with mosques closed around the world, more Muslims have instead turned to donating online.MyTenNights, a non-profit organization that collects donations for several charities in five countries, said at least 6.8 million pounds has been donated to a number of aid groups on its online portal. That compares with 2.7 million pounds at the same point last year.“The general charity sector has taken a hit, but the Muslim charity space has responded favorably to the current circumstances,” Ismael Abdela, co-founder of MyTenNights, said in an interview. “Two of our main charity partners are up 50% on year-on-year donations, and it’s too early to have any studies on this, but anecdotally, what I would suspect is that there’s a heightened sense of connectedness to faith at this time.”Corporate PhilanthropyWhile individuals may not be able to donate as much as before, corporate giving has soared in the last few months and accounts for more than $5 billion of donations, according to Candid, a group that tracks global philanthropy. Twitter Inc.’s Jack Dorsey is the largest single donor, contributing $1 billion, while Alphabet Inc.’s Google is the largest corporate donor, giving more than $907 million, its data showed.Philanthropic giving toward the Covid-19 pandemic is 10 times higher than the amount donated in the aftermath of the 9/11 attack, and reflects the global nature of the coronavirus, said Andrew Grabois, corporate philanthropy manager at Candid.“The global surge in giving for Covid-19 relief efforts reflects the scope and hybrid nature of the pandemic,” he said. “It is a public health disaster affecting the health and mortality of people in every country and continent and a crushing economic crisis that has forced more than a billion people worldwide to quarantine and countless businesses to shutter.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-could-mean-the-end-of-small-charities/story-M6wIFIGyxNdNX8ZNXMP7GN.html

The list is headed by entrepreneur James Dyson, who made his fortune by inventing bag-less vacuum cleaners. Dyson and family are estimated to be worth £16.2 billion, while Sri and Gopi Hinduja and family are worth £16 billion.List compiler Robert Watts said: “Ever since the financial crisis of 2008-9, Britain’s wealthiest people have become richer and richer. Covid-19 has called time on their golden period. This year’s rich list paints a picture of Britain on the brink of calamity - two months after lockdown and already billions of pounds have been wiped out”.“You may not like the super-rich, but it is hard to deny that our economy will need the jobs they create and the taxes they and their companies pay if we are to escape a prolonged recession that causes further misery to millions.”The top ten in the list are: David and Simon Reuben (£16 billion), Leonard Blavatnik (£15.78 billion), Jim Ratcliffe (£12.15 billion), Kirsten and Jorn Rausing (£12.1 billion), Alisher Usmanov (£11.68 billion), Guy, George and Galen Jr Weston and family (£10.53 billion), Charlene de Carvalho-Heineken and Michel de Carvalho (£10.3 billion), the Duke of Westminster and the Grosvenor family (£10.29 billion).Queen Elizabeth is ranked at 372 with an estimated worth of £350 million.The list organisers said: “We have adjusted valuations of the richest 1,000 where there have been significant movements in the share prices of quoted companies, estimating the knock-on effect on the fortunes of owners of large stakes in those companies”.“We measure identifiable wealth, whether land, property, racehorses, art or significant shares in publicly quoted companies.

There remains a very long way to go, and I must be frank that a vaccine might not come to fruition”.“But we are leading the global effort. Some of the most promising research into vaccines is happening right here in the UK - and this weekend we are announcing a £93 million investment to open the new Vaccine Manufacturing and Innovation Centre a full 12 months ahead of schedule”.The under-construction facility will have capacity to produce enough vaccine doses to serve the entire UK population in as little as six months. The funding will ensure the centre opens in summer 2021, a year ahead of schedule.To be located on the Harwell Science and Innovation Campus in Oxfordshire, the new centre will be the UK’s first not-for-profit organisation established to develop and advance the mass production of vaccines. The centre will also accelerate the production of vaccines for existing illnesses such as the flu virus.Business secretary Alok Sharma said: “As the biggest contributor to the international coalition to find a vaccine, the UK is leading the global response. Once a breakthrough is made, we need to be ready to manufacture a vaccine by the millions”.As of Saturday, the UK-wide death was 34,466, with a cumulative number of 240,161 cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-vaccine-may-not-come-to-fruition-says-pm-boris-johnson/story-XusOA6gmkhLwZzPxKD8TxO.html

Residents were advised not to leave the city and any who do need to leave must provide a negative test result taken within the previous 48 hours.Jilin is the second largest city of Jilin province, which borders North Korea and Russia. It temporarily suspended passenger train services last Wednesday. The number of China’s new asymptomatic cases of the coronavirus fell to 12 from 13, the NHC said.Zhong Nanshan, the Chinese government’s senior medical adviser told CNN on Saturday that the danger of a second wave of infections is looming large. “The majority of... Chinese at the moment are still susceptible to COVID-19 infection because (of) a lack of immunity,” Zhong said as quoted in the CNN report. “We are facing (a) big challenge, it’s not better than the foreign countries I think at the moment.”Zhong acknowledged that the number of infections were initially under reported in Wuhan but said the government has learned lessons from the SARS epidemic 17 years ago and he thinks all the data will be correct since Jan. 23.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-reports-five-new-coronavirus-cases-adviser-says-risk-of-second-wave-remains/story-ZvoX6MJ4AmkIueKtr2Dz7H.html

The document also stresses that spraying individuals with disinfectants is “not recommended under any circumstances”.“This could be physically and psychologically harmful and would not reduce an infected person’s ability to spread the virus through droplets or contact,” said the document. Spraying chlorine or other toxic chemicals on people can cause eye and skin irritation, bronchospasm and gastrointestinal effects, it adds. The organisation is also warning against the systematic spraying and fumigating of disinfectants on to surfaces in indoor spaces, citing a study that has shown it to be ineffective outside direct spraying areas. “If disinfectants are to be applied, this should be done with a cloth or wipe that has been soaked in disinfectant,” it says.The SARS-CoV-2 virus, the cause of the pandemic that has killed more than 300,000 people worldwide since its appearance in late December in China, can attach itself to surfaces and objects. However, no precise information is currently available for the period during which the viruses remain infectious on the various surfaces. Studies have shown that the virus can stay on several types of surfaces for several days. However, these maximum durations are only theoretical because they are recorded under laboratory conditions and should be “interpreted with caution” in the real-world environment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spraying-disinfectants-in-open-doesn-t-kill-coronavirus-can-even-be-harmful-who/story-DsGokgMale5PCKol45qVXK.html

Bill Gates has also privately funded SCAN, according to the foundation.On Thursday, SCAN in a statement said it has been in talks with the FDA since March 1 and initiated its request for emergency use authorization (EUA) on March 23, submitting data on April 13. “We have been notified that a separate federal emergency use authorization is required to return results for self-collected tests,” SCAN said.Representatives for the Food and Drug Administration did not have an immediate comment on SCAN’s status. Representatives of King County Health Department referred questions to SCAN. SCAN said it did not have an update on specific timing for when testing would restart. Separately, the FDA on Saturday approved a standalone at-home sample collection kit for Everlywell Inc, a health and wellness company, which launched its kit in March.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-fda-suspends-bill-gates-backed-at-home-covid-19-testing-program/story-78Glv1xhcLh2VMtPscHP1I.html

It trails the U.S., Russia, and UK The numbers exceed those in Spain, which has a total of 230,698 cases and is planning to extend the state of emergency for a fifth time to combat the outbreak.Brazil’s new cases come as Vice President Hamilton Mourao and his wife are in self-isolation after a civil servant he came into contact with tested positive for Covid-19, according to a note sent by his press office. They are awaiting test results, which are expected on Monday.The country reported a daily record for cases on Friday -- hours after Jair Bolsonaro lost his second health minister in under a month as the president’s reopen-at-all-costs stance alienates the medical community and deepens a political clash with state governors.Nelson Teich, who took over the post in April after Bolsonaro fired his predecessor amid public discord over social distancing, quit Friday after just 29 days on the job. The health ministry gave no details on who will replace him.Brazil reported a record 15,305 new cases on Friday, solidifying its status as the new global hotspot for the disease. Still, it has a lower death rate than Spain and other badly-hit countries. Brazil lost 816 Covid-19 patients in the past 24 hours, raising total fatalities to 15,633 -- which is almost half of the death toll of Spain, France and Italy.Investors have taken notice of the turmoil. Brazil has the world’s worst-performing stock market and currency. The benchmark Ibovespa index’s 54% decline in US dollar terms is the biggest slide among key indexes globally, and the real slumped 31%.With most Brazilians backing social distancing guidelines, Bolsonaro’s popularity is suffering, according to a MDA/CNT poll that interviewed 2,002 people May 7-10.

Coronaviruses, including MERS and SARS, have not seen a particularly reliable one so far... the best scenario is that if one of the vaccines that people are making is effective and progressing relatively fast, it should be available as soon as possible from March to June next year,” Zhang was quoted by the Global Times.Earlier, US President Donald Trump had expressed confidence that a vaccine for coronavirus could be available by the end of the year.“I think we’ll have a vaccine by the end of the year,” Trump said at a Fox News virtual town hall. “We’ll have a vaccine much sooner rather than later.”As the world leaders continue to expedite the date of vaccine, Covid-19 continues to affect the world with over 4.6 million affected with the virus and more than 311,425 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-says-8-covid-19-vaccine-candidates-in-clinical-trial/story-oSjlCHjzJtyjEcErJd0v6J.html

Our world faces a crisis like no other. The Covid-19 pandemic is not just a global health emergency. It is a human crisis that is upending lives, destroying livelihoods and deepening mistrust around the world,” he said. He also said that the world knows from previous public health crises that the actions of faith leaders influence people’s values, attitudes, behaviours, and actions.At the conference, he thanked religious leaders for supporting my appeal for a global ceasefire in view of Covid-19. However, he also noted that certain place around the world continues to see conflicts unabated. “Yet we continue to see conflicts rage in many places -- along with a rise in ethnonationalism, stigma and hate speech targeting vulnerable communities and exacerbating suffering. Meanwhile, extremists and radical groups are seeking to exploit eroding trust in leadership and feed on people’s vulnerability to serve their own ends,” he said.He also asked the religious leaders to reject and condemn all forms of intolerance that surged amid coronavirus.“...reject xenophobia, racism and all forms of intolerance. Second, I also made an appeal for peace at home. Across the globe, we are seeing an alarming increase in violence against women and girls as this pandemic spreads. This is in violation of principles common to every faith, and I appeal to religious leaders to categorically condemn such acts,” he added.He also stressed the need to fight the spread of misinformation amid the pandemic.“...as we fight the spread of disinformation and misinformation, I ask religious leaders to leverage your networks and communication capacities to support governments in promoting WHO-recommended public health measures.”Lastly, he urged faith leaders to support the continuity of education, working with education providers to find solutions to combat the effect of the contagion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/religious-leaders-can-play-pivotal-role-to-combat-covid-19-pandemic-says-un-chief/story-nqi9JiueW6PY1pwjgKNMbI.html
17-05-2020||World||Italy to reopen borders for EU tourists in early June, scrap quarantine||Italy will reopen to European tourists from early June and scrap a 14-day mandatory quarantine period, the government said on Saturday, as it quickened the exit from the coronavirus lockdown.Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte enforced an economically crippling shutdown in early March to counter a pandemic that has so far killed more than 31,500 people in Italy.The shutdown halted all holidaymaking in a country heavily dependent on the tourism industry.Although Italy never formally closed its borders and has allowed people to cross back and forth for work or health reasons, it banned movement for tourism and imposed a two-week isolation period for new arrivals.In March, the European Union banned foreign nationals from entering its Schengen zone, an open border zone comprising 22 of 27 member states, with exceptions for medical workers and essential travel. But on Wednesday, the EU set out plans for a phased restart of summer travel, urging member states to reopen its internal borders, while recommending that external borders remain shut for most travel until at least the middle of June. In a press release, Italy’s government did not explicitly state which foreign nationals would be allowed to enter, but said its new measures respected the “legal order of the European Union”.Beginning on June 3, visitors within the Schengen zone will be allowed to enter Italy with no obligation to self-isolate. Italians will also be able to move between regions, though local authorities can limit travel if infections spike.Movements to and from abroad can be limited by regional decree “in relation to specific states and territories, in accordance with the principles of adequacy and proportionality to the epidemiological risk”, the government said. The latest decree is also a boon to Italy’s agricultural sector, which relies on roughly 350,000 seasonal workers from abroad.Farming lobby group Coldiretti said farms were already preparing to organise some 150,000 workers from places including Romania, Poland and Bulgaria. The peak of Italy’s contagion passed at the end of March but with experts warning a second wave cannot be ruled out, Conte had been reluctant to lift the lockdown quickly.His approach frustrated many of Italy’s regions, with some already allowing businesses to reopen before the restrictions were lifted.Restaurants, bars and hairdressers are being allowed to reopen on Monday, two weeks earlier than initially planned. Shops will also open and Italians will finally be able to see friends, as long as they live within their same region.Church services will begin again but the faithful will have to follow social distancing rules and holy water fonts will be empty. Mosques will also reopen.Gatherings of large groups are still banned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italy-to-reopen-borders-for-eu-tourists-in-early-june-scrap-quarantine/story-7abuOt0oskxuKcem9NFhSP.html
17-05-2020||World||China set to be challenged on Covid-19 handling at key WHO meeting||At the first meeting of the World Health Organization’s governing body since Covid-19 stormed the globe, China is set to be challenged on two of its most sensitive issues: The Communist Party’s initial handling of the virus and the status of Taiwan’s participation.While the U.S. has launched a daily barrage of attacks on China, including suggesting the virus escaped from a laboratory in the central city of Wuhan, the European Union and Australia are set to play a key role pushing for a probe into the virus’s origin when the World Health Assembly -- the WHO’s decision making body -- gathers on Monday for an annual meeting in Geneva.A U.S.-backed bloc is also pushing for Taiwan, whose handling of the virus has been a rare success story, to attend the meeting as an observer. The move -- aimed at strengthening Taiwan’s official and unofficial diplomatic relationships -- has angered China, which views the island as a province and has long sought to isolate it on the world stage.The showdown reflects a broader geopolitical struggle pitting the U.S. and its allies against China, whose authoritarian system has come under scrutiny in the wake of a pandemic that has killed about 300,000 people and devastated the global economy. The U.S. has suspended funding for the WHO, claiming it’s biased toward China, and even suggested setting up an alternative body.Yet for all the noise, most analysts expect China to command support from a large swathe of the nearly 200 countries taking part in the assembly that need good relations with the world’s second-biggest economy to shore up domestic growth. And any effort to replace the WHO is also unlikely to gain traction.“As much as the WHO has struggled and been the subject of criticism in this crisis, any replacement would look remarkably similar to what we have today,” said Natasha Kassam, a former Australian diplomat in China who is now a research fellow at the Lowy Institute in Sydney. “It is hard to imagine an effective global health institution that excluded China, and it’s hard to imagine the United States making Taiwan’s participation a red line.”Boycott ThreatsStill, the anger in some parts of the world over China’s response to the pandemic is still fresh, and will likely play out this week. Apart from an initial cover up, the world has become increasingly upset with China’s heavy-handed response to any criticism.Australia in particular has felt the heat from Beijing, which threatened a boycott of its goods and also suspended meat imports from four processing plants for “technical” reasons. The government in Canberra called the boycott threats “economic coercion” and hasn’t backed down on its calls for a virus probe.“You can’t let the trail go cold,” Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison told reporters on May 8. “And I think Australia and the United States and the United Kingdom and countries all around the world would like to know what happened, because we don’t want to see it happen again.”While the EU was still working out the wording of the proposal in the run-up to the assembly, the European Commission has said a draft resolution envisaged calling for “an independent review on lessons learned from the international health response to the coronavirus.”Australia has said that could happen through the WHO’s Health Emergencies Program, which was set up after the Ebola crisis in 2014, and the International Health Regulations Review Committee, which assessed the response to the H1N1 pandemic in 2009.Red LineThe building acrimony has also made more countries willing to pressure China on Taiwan, which is a red line for authorities in Beijing. President Tsai Ing-wen’s government in Taipei has made a vocal pitch to be included in the proceedings this week, saying it needs access to firsthand information about the spread of the disease.The WHO has said its Ethiopian director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has no mandate to offer Taiwan an invitation to the assembly because there is “no clear support” among member states. Tedros in April had accused Taiwan of being behind a racist campaign against him and Africans in general -- a charge that Taipei rejected as “slander.”A proposal backed by 13 member states has called for the assembly to make a call on whether Taiwan can attend. China has blocked Taiwan’s participation in the organization since the independence-leaning Tsai was elected in 2016 and refused to accept that both sides belong to “one China.”The U.S. is “determined” to see Taiwan participate in the meetings as an observer, with a spokesperson at the U.S. Mission in Geneva saying that lessons from its successful experience fighting Covid-19 “would be of significant benefit to the rest of the world.”“The People’s Republic of China would rather that success not be shared, no doubt to avoid uncomfortable comparisons,” the spokesperson said.Blocking TaiwanFor its part, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said it “firmly rejects” countries’ proposal to invite Taiwan to attend the assembly, and has also blasted the call for an independent probe into the virus origin as “political maneuvering.”“Certain countries insisted on discussing proposals involving Taiwan to politicize a public health issue,” Zhao said Friday. “This consequence can only severely interfere with the progress of the conference and undermine international cooperation.”China is confident that the majority of countries won’t allow Taiwan to participate as an observer, and Beijing would “never” allow an independent investigative team inside its borders, said Shi Yinhong, an adviser to China’s cabinet and also a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing.“It’s becoming clear that China’s basic stance is to reject criticism, and focus on the efforts it has made in the global fight,” Shi said. “This is a position that China won’t change, hence posing a sharp opposition to the voices of accusing its cover-up and claiming accountability.”Legally there’s no provision in the WHO’s constitution, resolutions or rules of procedure that would prevent Tedros from inviting Taiwan to the assembly as an observer, said Julian G. Ku, a distinguished professor of constitutional law at Hofstra University, who studies China’s relationship with international law. Since nobody is asking the WHO to invite Taiwan as a member state or to recognize Taiwan as the representative of China, the body’s citation of a 1971 United Nations decision recognizing Beijing is “irrelevant,” he said.Still, a majority of assembly members are likely to block Taiwan’s participation, according to Kharis Templeman, an adviser to the Project on Taiwan in the Indo-Pacific at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution.“It’s just a fact of international politics now that most countries aren’t willing to risk their relationship with the PRC to take symbolic actions in support of Taiwan,” he said, referring to China’s formal name. “As long as Beijing makes countries choose between them, Taiwan is going to lose.”The U.S. can hardly complain about China’s influence in the WHO given that it encouraged Beijing to play a greater role in international organizations for years, said Scott Kennedy, senior adviser and trustee chair in Chinese business and economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.“Now the U.S. is crying foul because it turns out Chinese interests don’t align with its own and China is pretty darn good at playing this game,” Kennedy said. “If the U.S. doesn’t want a Chinese-led international order, it needs to do a better job of fighting for its own vision within these organizations.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-set-to-be-challenged-on-covid-19-handling-at-key-who-meeting/story-zsIxB2USd9aqv5D7R6KUMI.html
17-05-2020||World||Ex-president Obama criticises US officials’ coronavirus response in online graduation speech||Former President Barack Obama on Saturday criticized some officials overseeing the coronavirus response, telling college graduates in an online commencement address that the pandemic shows many officials “aren’t even pretending to be in charge.”Obama spoke on “Show Me Your Walk, HBCU Edition,” a two-hour livestreaming event for historically black colleges and universities broadcast on YouTube, Facebook and Twitter. His remarks were surprisingly political and touched on current events beyond the virus and its social and economic impacts.“More than anything, this pandemic has fully, finally torn back the curtain on the idea that so many of the folks in charge know what they’re doing,” he said. “A lot them aren’t even pretending to be in charge.”Obama did not name President Donald Trump or any other federal or state officials.As he congratulated graduates and commiserated over the difficult world they face, the former president noted the February shooting death of Ahmaud Arbery, 25, who was killed while jogging on a residential street in Georgia.“Let’s be honest: A disease like this just spotlights the underlying inequalities and extra burdens that black communities have historically had to deal with in this country,” Obama said. “We see it in the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on our communities, just as we see it when a black man goes for a jog and some folks feel like they can stop and question and shoot him if he doesn’t submit to their questioning.”Obama will also deliver a televised prime-time commencement address later Saturday for the high school Class of 2020 during an hour-long event that will also feature LeBron James, Malala Yousafzai and Ben Platt, among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ex-president-obama-criticises-us-officials-coronavirus-response-in-online-graduation-speech/story-lfDiuAjBmfu0htoQQvQsvL.html
17-05-2020||India||Lockdown 4.0 update: TN’s doubling rate reduced in lockdown 3.0, Punjab and Andhra’s more than doubled||Moments after the centre announced a two-week extension to the nationwide lockdown with additional permissions to resume some activity on Sunday evening, Cabinet Secretary Rajeev Gauba held a meeting with the chief secretaries of states and union territories to underscore some key points in India’s progress in the fight against Covid-19, including an increase in the doubling rate of cases in 9 worst affected states during the period of the third lockdown.According to an official privy to the discussions during the video conference, Gauba pointed out that Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Punjab had registered a significant increase in the doubling rate since April 30, just before the beginning of the third phase of lockdown. Punjab had made the most remarkable progress by increasing its doubling rate of the virus from 7.3 days to 29.8 days on May 14, followed by Andhra Pradesh, which had more than doubled its doubling rate of 24.4 days on May 14 compared to 11.7 days on April 30. Uttar Pradesh, too, had made encouraging progress on this front with the doubling rate jumping from 14.6 days to 21.8 days in the same period; the state was closely followed by Gujarat that increased its doubling rate from 9.4 to 15.5 days.Among the worst-hit states, Maharashtra had made marginal improvement on that count by reaching a doubling rate of 11.6 days from 10 days on April 30, similarly, Delhi and Rajasthan, too, had barely managed to improve their doubling rates by a margin of 1.3 days and 1.7 days from 13.6 and 18 days respectively in the corresponding period.Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal had fared little better with increased doubling rates of 15.2 and 12.6 days respectively on May 14 as against 11.5 and 9.4 days on April 30.Tamil Nadu the third-worst affected state in the country was the only one among the top 10 to have reduced its doubling rate in the period. Tamil Nadu’s doubling rate had slipped to 8.4 days as on May 14 from 15.1 on April 30.The data assumes significance as the categorization of areas into red, orange or green zones in the states are dependent on parameters like active Covid-19 cases, cases per lakh population, doubling and fatality rates. The categorization, in turn will impact how much freedom for economic activity is granted in those zones.The movement of migrant labourers also came up for discussion between the centre and the states as it has played its part in spreading the infection to far-flung rural areas of the country.Rajiv Gauba is reported to have requested the state officials to cooperate in the running of more Shramik special trains to facilitate the movement of migrant workers, which has not only led to a political blame game between states but also to tragedies and law and order situations across the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lockdown-4-0-update-tn-s-doubling-rate-reduced-in-lockdown-3-0-punjab-and-andhra-s-more-than-doubled/story-0KIpfowsYh9eYVPxccPoOP.html
17-05-2020||India||Maha sees record 2,347 new cases in a day, tally at 33,053||In a first, Maharashtra on Sunday recorded over 2,000 Covid-19 cases, taking the tally to 33,053. The worst affected Indian city, Mumbai, too registered its highest single-day jump in cases with 1,595 new patients, bringing its count to 20,150.On the day, the state suffered 63 deaths (38 in Mumbai, nine in Pune, six in Aurangabad, three each in Solapur city and Raigad, and one each in Thane rural, Panvel, Latur and Amravati). The total death count in the state as of Sunday was 1198.Hours before the Centre announced it on Sunday evening, the Maharashtra government extended the ongoing lockdown till May 31. The state government is expected to soon issue its own notification, extending relaxations for commercial and industrial activities and bringing clarity on the delineation of the infection zones (red, orange and green).“Although the state government cannot dilute the restrictions imposed by the Centre, it has been given powers to prepare buffer/micro zones. This may increase the number of containment zones, but actual area will decrease, leaving room for activities in the remaining area. Also, the state had not relaxed some restrictions, even though the Centre had allowed it, in the last notification. For instance, the relaxations to allow more employees in government and private offices, or operating non-essential shops in a staggered manner even in red zones, were not implemented in cities like Mumbai, Thane, Pune and Nashik. The state can now go ahead with the opening of few more shops and increasing attendance in offices,” said a senior government official.In the last two days the state government had allowed manufacturers of umbrellas, raincoats and plastic sheets to operate their units and retailers to sell them. Similarly, the government has allowed employees of regional transport offices and sub-registrars to be at their workplaces, so at to ensure registration of vehicles and flats.“The notification issued on Sunday by the Centre will help us restructure containment zones by shrinking them. Commercial and other activities outside containment zones would thus be allowed. At the same time, lockdown restrictions in containment zones will have to be followed strictly,” said public works department minister and former chief minister Ashok Chavan. He said that the nod for public transport between states may come as a respite for migrant workers.The state has 1,688 containment zones. In Mumbai, the municipal corporation has broken the zones into smaller ones for better monitoring.The number of tests conducted in the state touched 273,239 on Sunday, with a 20.48% positivity. The state’s mortality rate has dropped to 3.70% against national rate of 3.16%, while the doubling rate in Maharashtra is little more than 10 days.State health minister Rajesh Tope said that owing to the change in discharge policy by the Centre, the recovery rate among the patients in the state has improved. “Of the 7,688 patients who have been discharged after recovery so far, 50% or 3,700 are in the past one week,” he said.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had demanded that the Centre allows operations of suburban trains in Mumbai, but only for essential services. The Central notification is, however, silent on the demand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maha-sees-record-2-347-new-cases-in-a-day-tally-at-33-053/story-B78uF1hx8yXpT6i3T6efQJ.html
17-05-2020||India||Govt eases Aarogya Setu app requirements||The Union government’s guidelines for the fourth phase of the nationwide curbs to check the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has eased the requirement for office-goers to mandatorily install the Aarogya Setu mobile application, asking employers instead to ensure “on best effort basis” their staff have the tool.A government official said that while it was not the government’s plan to make Aarogya Setu mandatory, the new rules represented a further rethink on pushing people to use the mobile application particularly after some began finding workarounds that defeated its purpose. The app is still mandatory for those taking the special trains or arriving from abroad by the repatriation flights.“We want users to feel that they need to download it, and making it mandatory to download was having the opposite effect. There were also some flaws that we were made aware of: in some cases, users kept screenshots of the results of the self-assessment saying they are safe and using it repeatedly; in others, many users deleted the app after downloading it,” said Abhishek Singh, CEO of MyGov and the National e-Governance Division (NeGD).The tool has been criticised by independent software researchers for having vulnerabilities and by privacy experts for collecting excess sensitive data that could aid in illegal surveillance. In the guidelines issued by the ministry of home affairs on Sunday evening, the government said: “With a view to ensure safety in offices and work places, employers on best effort basis should ensure that the application is installed by all employees having compatible mobile phones to put in best efforts to ensure that the contact-tracing app is downloaded.”“District authorities have been asked to advise individuals to install the Aarogya Setu application on compatible mobile phones and regularly update their health status on the app. This will facilitate timely provision of medical attention to those individuals who are at risk,” it added. Singh, however, said that states have the liberty to make the app mandatory. “Some states have stricter norms than what the Centre has spelt out. So, if any state wants to download it, it is within the legal framework to do so,” he said. Till now, the app has been downloaded by 105 million smart phone users on the Android and iOS systems. The government recently released a version for KaiOS for the 110 million Jio users in the country. The government has made it mandatory for those taking trains and Indian nationals arriving by flights as part of the repatriation missions.A senior official of the IT ministry, who asked not to be named, said the app also had no use for those using cheaper phones with no smartphone capability such as installing applications. “It was pointed out that the app is ineffective in the case of feature phone users,” the official said. As per IT ministry estimates, there are 1.2 billion mobile phone users in India, and only 350 million have smartphones. For the remaining 900 million feature phone users, the government has an IVRS-based telesurvey. But success on the survey remains limited, as the user has to place the call on the number ‘1921’ which then prompts a survey. IT ministry officials said that many people are unaware of the telesurvey and very few have been reached out to through it. “We have placed 0.6 million calls and 0.2 million people have taken the survey,” an IT ministry official said. The Internet Freedom Foundation said that while the amended guidelines were an improvement, concerns about mass surveillance and data breaches remained unaddressed. “The manner in which the term “best efforts” is interpreted by the government also remains to be seen and it will determine whether the app is still mandatory for all practical purposes. More detailed statement to follow tomorrow,” the IFF said on twitter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-eases-aarogya-setu-app-requirements/story-m5ZqO8yHxa2aHaH8qCgcuJ.html
17-05-2020||India||Vande Bharat flight to bring 169 Indians from Dhaka to Kolkata||New Delhi A total of 169 Indian nationals will be repatriated from Dhaka to Kolkata on May 18 on a special Air India flight under the Vande Bharat Mission, days after the Central and West Bengal governments had sparred on the lack of flights to the state.People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that special efforts have been made by the Indian high commission in Dhaka to identify and accord priority to citizens with compelling reasons to return because a large number of residents of West Bengal are currently in Bangladesh.The passengers on the first flight from Dhaka to Kolkata on Monday include 73 students, 16 senior citizens, 45 stranded tourists, 16 people with medical emergencies and a pregnant woman.“Not only in Dhaka, but Indian nationals stranded across Bangladesh were facilitated and the passengers for this flight have come from 18 different districts,” said one of the people cited above.Once the passengers reach Kolkata, they will be placed in quarantine for 14 days, following which they will travel to their homes spread across more than 20 districts, including Pashim Bardhaman, North 24 Parganas, Purba Medinipur and Jalpaiguri.Kolkata was not among the destinations in the initial list of 149 repatriation flights from more than 30 countries in the second phase of Vande Bharat Mission that will bring back some 32,000 people. The second phase began on May 16, after some 15,000 people were repatriated on 64 flights in the first phase.“Vande Bharat Mission is a very dynamic operation and flights are being added almost every day,” said another person.The Central and West Bengal governments were involved in a spat on the repatriation flights on May 14, with the external affairs ministry saying the state hadn’t confirmed if it has arranged quarantine facilities to receive people wishing to return from abroad.External affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava tweeted that flights to repatriate residents of West Bengal from abroad could be arranged if the state government confirmed it has organised quarantine facilities for them.Srivastava was responding to a tweet from West Bengal’s higher education minister Partha Chatterjee, who posted a schedule of the flights being organised during the second phase of Vande Bharat Mission and questioned why there were no flights to the state.According to the external affairs ministry, more than 3,700 people from West Bengal have registered for repatriation from different parts of the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vande-bharat-flight-to-bring-169-indians-from-dhaka-to-kolkata/story-5PGzoRS4ruRrzibSV5sFgI.html
17-05-2020||India||Rashtrapati Bhavan staffer tests Covid +ve||New Delhi: An assistant commissioner of police (ACP), posted at Rashtrapati Bhavan, has tested positive for the Covid-19 following which six of his colleagues have been quarantined, a senior official at the President’s house said on Sunday.The ACP has been hospitalised, while his office and nearby areas are being sanitised, the official added. So far, the authorities have been able to identify six contacts of the patient and their samples have been sent for testing.According to an official, the ACP lives in a government housing colony in East Delhi’s Karkardooma and used to commute daily to Rashtrapati Bhavan.While the ACP’s office is in the main building of the Rashtrapati Bhavan, it was away from President’s secretariat which houses the office of the President of India and his top officials.Even as the police officer had access to the main building, his duty, however, was not in the main building, the official added.Last month, authorities sealed at least 125 staff quarters inside the Rashtrapati Bhavan complex and ordered the inhabitants to strictly maintain self-isolation after a relative of a staff tested positive for Covid-19.The daughter-in-law of a sanitation worker of Rashtrapati Bhavan tested positive after she came in contact with her mother who died of Covid-19 complications at a private hospital near Karol Bagh.President Ram Nath Kovind has minimized his public interactions in this pandemic and holds most of his meetings online. The President has also launched an austerity drive to reduce about 20% of the estate’s expenses and divert the money for welfare of the poor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rashtrapati-bhavan-staffer-tests-covid-ve/story-HewcZEulsQLBveBwArN3OM.html

However, with three repeat telecasts, they will run 24x7 hours on all week days.Like some morning assemblies in schools, the telecasts will begin with patriotic songs and end with the national song or the national anthem, according to the plan. In between, public service announcements on Covid-19, health, hygiene, Yoga and promos for music, dance forms will be used.During the lockdown period, provisions have also been made for telecast of live interactive sessions on these channels with subject and counselling experts from home through Skype.To enhance the reach of these channels, the HRD ministry has tied up with private DTH operators like Tata Sky and Airtel as well. States will develop content according to their needs, which will be offered on these platforms.Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman spoke about these new channels and the online courses by the top 100 institutions from May 30 as part of the government’s plan to mitigate the impact of Covid-19 and the nationwide shutdown of schools and colleges it has led to. “All universities which have an accreditation A+, that is a score of 3.26 and above, or all universities which are in top 100 in NIRF, can automatically offer Full Online Degree courses without prior approval of UGC during this academic year 2020-21,” said higher education secretary Amit Khare.Among other initiatives, the HRD ministry will launch a unified education portal to meet all needs of school students, use of radio to disseminate education, a portal Manodarpan, to meet the psychological needs and ensure well being of students.Special e-content for those with visual or hearing impairments developed on Digitally Accessible Information System (DAISY) and in sign language on NIOS website and YouTube has also been brought in to ensure equity, an official added.A New National Curriculum and Pedagogical Framework, use of radio including podcasts and increased weightage to online modules in regular courses for school as well as colleges is also envisaged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-announces-12-dth-channels-for-schoolchildren/story-8kfx8ecvCIFStNZ4CRSLVO.html

Sawant said that those coming by train needed to be ‘controlled’ after more than 650 people passengers alighted in Goa on Saturday and Sunday of whom 12 tested positive for Covid-19.“From next week, the Rajdhani express will be stopped due to our request. We have to control those coming in by train,” Sawant told reporters.The Goa government has also quarantined those persons who travelled in the same coach as those who have been found positive and announced that they will be tested again in 14 days before being allowed to proceed for home quarantine. Six persons were confirmed positive by Sunday evening, while the confirmatory tests of an additional 10 people -- mainly train passengers -- who tested positive in preliminary rapid tests were awaited. “I have spoken to Amit Shah and the state will have to decide on a detailed strategy. The current positive cases which have come into Goa are imported or migrated cases,” Sawant said. He said that there will also be increased surveillance along the borders including those of truckers who were arriving in the state from red zones. Two among the second wave of cases that have come into the state are of truckers -- one from Gujarat and another from Himachal Pradesh. Sawant, however, sought to reassure the state that all the new cases were from outside the state and were being detected because Goa -- unlike any other state -- was screening all entrants, except for truckers who were only screened for symptoms in order to avoid hold ups at the border check posts. “The current positive cases which have come into Goa are imported or migrated cases. There is no need to fear in Goa. There is no community transmission. The issue is of people returning to Goa,” Sawant said. He said that the 10th and 12th standard examinations in the state scheduled this week onwards will go ahead with all proper measures. Goa’s tally of Covid-19 cases has risen to 26 of which 19 are active cases. The number is expected to go up significantly when the results of those whose reports are pending come in.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-cm-pulls-chain-on-special-train-after-spike-in-covid-19-cases/story-30xzsQO8F7vTMZeHWjM0EM.html

The second phase began on May 16, after some 15,000 people were repatriated on 64 flights in the first phase.“Vande Bharat Mission is a very dynamic operation and flights are being added almost every day,” said another person.The Central and West Bengal governments were involved in a spat on the repatriation flights on May 14, with the external affairs ministry saying the state hadn’t confirmed if it has arranged quarantine facilities to receive people wishing to return from abroad.External affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava tweeted that flights to repatriate residents of West Bengal from abroad could be arranged if the state government confirmed it has organised quarantine facilities for them.Srivastava was responding to a tweet from West Bengal’s higher education minister Partha Chatterjee, who posted a schedule of the flights being organised during the second phase of Vande Bharat Mission and questioned why there were no flights to the state.According to the external affairs ministry, more than 3,700 people from West Bengal have registered for repatriation from different parts of the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vande-bharat-flight-to-bring-169-indians-from-dhaka-to-kolkata-days-after-spat-between-west-bengal-and-centre/story-RhjoYNiBTFvcbzqoNJJcGO.html

17-05-2020||India||India hopes Afghan political deal will end externally sponsored terrorism||India on Sunday said it hoped the deal between Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and his rival Abdullah Abdullah will lead to fresh efforts for peace in the war-torn country and an end to externally sponsored terror. While calling for an immediate ceasefire to bolster the Afghan peace process, a statement issued by the external affairs ministry expressed deep concern at the enhanced violence and terrorism in Afghanistan. Ghani and Abdullah signed a power-sharing deal on Sunday after months of political discord triggered by last year’s disputed presidential election. The final result of the election was announced only in February and both leaders had claimed victory. A statement issued by the external affairs ministry welcomed the political agreement concluded in Kabul and said: “India hopes the Political Agreement and creation of the High Council of National Reconciliation will result in renewed efforts for establishing enduring peace and stability and putting an end to externally sponsored terrorism and violence.”India, the statement added, has “consistently supported inclusive governance, national unity, strong institutions, constitutional order, rights of all sections of society and the territorial integrity of Afghanistan”.It added, “The continuing and enhanced violence and terror in Afghanistan is a matter of deep concern. India calls for an immediate ceasefire and assistance to the people of Afghanistan to deal with the humanitarian situation arising from Covid-19.”The Indian government has been watching with growing concern both a spike in violence in Afghanistan and the role being given to Pakistan in the US efforts to implement a deal with the Taliban. These concerns were conveyed to the US special envoy for Afghanistan reconciliation, Zalmay Khalilzad, when he recently visited New Delhi. Khalilzad called on India to engage with the Taliban, though people familiar with developments said the government is yet to decide on this issue. According to the final result of the Afghan election announced in February. Ghani was declared president by the Election Commission after securing a slightly higher percentage of votes than Abdullah.Abdullah will now lead the High Council of National Reconciliation with executive authority and his team will have a 50% share in the cabinet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-hopes-afghan-political-deal-will-end-externally-sponsored-terrorism/story-RpFJP2rLEhVdeqppiDKgPO.html

17-05-2020||India||Two weeks after inter-state travel resumes, Covid cases spike in Assam||Two weeks after inter-state travel resumed, Assam has seen a spike in the number of Covid-19 cases with the tally nearing a hundred.Since Saturday, seven people including a nine-year-old boy who returned from New Delhi few days ago have tested positive taking Assam’s total to 98 cases (including one from Nagaland tested and treated in Guwahati).While 42 people have recovered, two patients have died and 51 are under treatment. Two patients have migrated to West Bengal and Bihar.According to official figures, till Sunday afternoon 23 people who had returned to Assam by road and rail, since inter-state movement of people resumed on May 4, have tested positive for Covid-19.Assam recorded its first positive case on March 31 when a 52-year-old cancer patient was found infected with coronavirus. It took another 37 days for the figure to reach 50 on May 7 and just 10 more days to double and near the three-figure mark.Till Sunday, 20 of the state’s 33 districts had recorded Covid-19 cases. Of them 14 have active cases at present with Kamrup (Metro), where the state’s biggest city Guwahati is located, topping the tally with 23 cases.Significantly, till April 30 - a month since the first infection was detected-Assam had 43 positive cases. After that there was a lull five days when the next case was recorded on May 5, a day after inter-state movement was allowed. Since then, the state has recorded new cases almost daily.While the inter-state movement of people is believed to be a reason for the spike, one person who used to work in a potato warehouse in Guwahati has been linked to many positive cases in recent days.The man was tested positive on May 7, turned out to be a super spreader, infecting 17 people he came in contact with. It is not yet known where and how he contracted the virus.Assam on Thursday released a fresh set of standard operating procedures to be followed while dealing with persons returning to the state from other parts of the country.The procedures list out how passengers will be dealt with once they enter Assam and get down at various stations. Officials have been asked to follow the rules on transportation, screening, testing and quarantine for the passengers.“Anyone found symptomatic will be segregated and taken to hospitals for tests. Others will be allowed to go to their home districts where they will be placed in institutional quarantine for at least 14 days,” health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma had said on Thursday.Passengers over 75 years, children below 10 years and their families, pregnant women and persons with disabilities will be allowed to go to their homes where they as well as their family members will have to keep themselves quarantined for 14 days.Abandoning its earlier plan to turn schools and colleges into quarantine facilities, the government has now decided to requisition hotels, lodges etc. and keep passengers there. The cost of rent and food will be borne by the state government, Sarma said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-weeks-after-inter-state-travel-resumes-covid-cases-spike-in-assam/story-BZF14ALvEi63plvcCPie2I.html
17-05-2020||India||Rajasthan govt to provide free ration to labourers, daily wage workers, rickshaw pullers||The Rajasthan government will be providing free ration to labourers and daily wagers, and for the same a special assistance scheme is being made for their families. The government has made 26 categories that includes beggars, barbers, washer men, rickshaw pullers, domestic helps and others for special assistance. The district collectors have been asked to conduct survey to assess numbers.Food and Civil Supply Minister, Ramesh Meena said “The lockdown has badly affected the daily wagers and in order to assist them, the government is identifying them. So far, 26 categories have been listed and more could be added. The identified categories are being surveyed to assess their numbers. The survey work will be completed by May 20 in rural areas and May 24 in urban areas.”“There are many who aren’t getting benefit of schemes and are daily wagers. After the reports are received, the government would provide them free dry ration,” he added.Chief Secretary DB Gupta has directed all collectors to conduct survey in their respective districts. “Due to Covid-19 pandemic, there is nationwide lockdown since last 50 days, because of which all industries, trades, business and other economic activities are stalled. This has resulted in unemployment of labourer and daily wagers, and in coming time, they would face difficulty for two meals a day,” said Gupta. He added that the way the pandemic is spreading, it seems that situation will take time to normalise. In the orders issued to the collectors, the government has issued the guidelines for identification during survey of this special category such as only Jan-Aadhar data should be used. For non NFSA families, survey through village level core committees and booth level officer; and in urban areas through municipalities and BLOs. Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot have many times urged GoI for additional allocation of wheat as other than beneficiaries of NFSA and BPL families, there are many families who need free ration as due to lockdown they aren’t able to earn their daily bread. Majority among are those which are daily wagers but today are helpless due to lockdown.The state government had requested GoI to allot additional wheat to the state to fulfill requirement. There are 4.46 crore families covered under the NFSA in the state as per the census of 2011 which, should be 5.04 crore as per the current population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-govt-to-provide-free-ration-to-labourers-daily-wage-workers-rickshaw-pullers/story-t1E8J2prxDgM29nC7n95zI.html

17-05-2020||India||Auraiya road accident: Two more migrant workers die, toll rises to 26||Two more migrant workers died on Sunday following injuries sustained in the road accident a day earlier at Auraiya in Uttar Pradesh, raising the death toll in the incident to 26, said local police. Twenty-four migrant workers had died and 36 injured on Saturday early morning when a trailer truck carrying sacks of lime along with 43 people rammed into the back of a stationary truck with many other migrant workers sitting in it near a roadside eatery on the national highway in Auraiya. In a statement issued here, the Auraiya police said the accident took place near Shivji Dhaba in Tikauli village involving a trailer truck and a mini-truck with both the vehicles falling into a ditch by the roadside. “In the accident, 26 migrant labourers died, while 34 others sustained injuries,” the statement said while updating the casualty figures. A case has been registered against the drivers, owners and transporters of both the vehicles under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, the Epidemic Diseases Act and the Motor Vehicles Act at Kotwali police station in Auraiya. Investigations are going on in this regard, police said, adding that efforts are being made to arrest the drivers, owners and transporters of both the vehicles. Meanwhile, as many as 32 injured migrant labourers were admitted to the Uttar Pradesh University of Medical Sciences at Saifai in Etawah district. The varsity’s Vice-Chancellor, Dr Raj Kumar said, “The condition of four migrant labourers is extremely serious, while seven others are in serious condition. Apart from this, 20 other injured labourers are also undergoing treatment. Some of these labourers could be discharged in the next couple of days.” Shiv Kumar, an injured labourer who was going from Rajasthan to West Bengal, while recalling the accident said, “There were around 40-50 persons travelling in the trailer truck. As the trailer hit the stationary mini-truck near a ‘dhaba’ (roadside eatery), both the vehicles overturned and people fell down. Some came under the truck.” The accident in Auraiya is the latest one in a string of mishaps involving migrant workers returning to their native states amid the coronavirus lockdown. Most of the victims were sitting on sacks of lime powder loaded on the trailer and were crushed when the vehicles overturned and fell into a ditch following the crash near an eatery between 3 am and 3.30 am on the Auraiya-Kanpur Dehat stretch of the national highway, police said. While many of the workers were from Jharkhand and West Bengal, some were from Kushinagar in eastern Uttar Pradesh, they pointed out. “In the accident, most of the labourers were crushed under these bags, which were on the trailer truck, and died. Some of them succumbed to injuries on the way to hospital,” District Magistrate Abhishek Singh said, adding that all the deceased were men. The mini-truck, which was going from Delhi to Madhya Pradesh, had stopped at the eatery as some workers wanted to have tea. It was carrying around 22 people, including five women and seven children, officials said. The trailer truck with 43 migrants was coming from Rajasthan, they said. Both the vehicles were ferrying people who found themselves without jobs, money or food during the lockdown and were desperate to get back home.

Similarly, those belonging to Odisha also would be ferried up to the state’s borders by buses.“For those migrant labourers who are from far off states like West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh, the government will make arrangements to send them by Shramik Express trains duly transporting them to the embarkation points free of cost,” the principal secretary said.In the last three days, around 4,661 migrant labourers walking home were stopped at various check posts and sent to 62 relief centres. Of them, 485 people were walking to various districts of Andhra Pradesh and the remaining migrant workers belonged to other states, including Odisha (966), Bihar (815), UP (1012), Jharkhand (576) and Chattisgarh (331).“We have already arranged 31 Shramik Express trains from AP transporting 39,000 people to different destinations in the last till date. Another five trains would be run for 7,500 people on Sunday. We have planned to run another 22 special trains during this week for 33,000 people,” Krishna Babu said.Over the last few weeks, images of migrant workers walking across different parts of India have highlighted the desperation of the marginalised people hit hard by the lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jagan-reddy-orders-free-food-transport-for-migrants-returning-home/story-6hwCehJVlAtHf5ijON6fkK.html

There are three jails in Delhi -- Tihar, Rohini and Mandoli.After a 28-year-old inmate of Rohini Jail tested positive for the coronavirus, 15 others who shared a barrack with him and one head warden contracted the infection.The jail authorities said they are conducting medical screening of each inmate more frequently and at a faster pace. All the inmates have been strictly advised not to hide about their health conditions in case they are unwell and should report to doctor immediately, the authorities said.The jail staff and doctors have been educating the inmates about the novel coronavirus and the precautionary measures to be taken to contain its spread, said an official.“Every inmate has been provided with two masks each and they are reused after washing. These masks have been stitched by jail inmates,” he added.While coming out of barracks, it is compulsory for inmates to wear masks. The jail authorities also encourage inmates to wear masks while inside the barracks too as a preventive measure, said the DG (Prisons) of Tihar, Sandeep Goel.The inmates cannot be confined to their barracks all the time. They do come out when needed, and in such times, it is ensured they have limited interaction with members of other barracks, Goel said.The inmates usually come out of their respective barracks either to avail phone facility, canteen facility or to visit the jail office or dispensary which is within the jail premises, he said.All these areas are encircled so that inmates wait in queue within the marked circle to avail the facility as and when their turn comes, he said.Only eight to 10 inmates are at a time allowed to come outside their barracks to avail phone facility. Earlier, they used to interact with inmates of other barracks but now, they are very cautious and have limited interaction and maintain social distancing even while speaking to inmates belonging to their own barrack, officials said.Usually, a barrack houses 20-25 inmates.A major step that was taken towards maintaining social distance was to decongest the jails. The jail authorities said when they started the process of decongestion back in March, the population in jails were 175 per cent of the capacity -- the three jails were housing 17,500 inmates against the capacity of 10,000. But a lot of effort was taken and many inmates were either released on emergency parole or on interim bail.So far, 3,500 inmates have been released and more will be freed in the coming days to avoid over-crowding.Another significant effort that was taken was to stop court production of inmates and ‘mulaqat’ (meeting) with family members to ensure they are not exposed, they added.Phone facility in the jail was made free of cost for the inmates and it is ensured, they get to speak to their family at least once in a week.In case someone falls sick, doctor after checking his health condition decides if the person needs to be kept in medical isolation which is made in each barrack or if he has to be kept in a jail dispensary from where his conditions are monitored regularly, they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/to-arrest-covid-spread-jails-intensify-medical-screening-of-inmates-suspend-mulaqat-with-family/story-lRcOyZcfV5TtMqutc5s1fM.html

17-05-2020||India||India brings down coronavirus test swab price to one-tenth||As COVID-19 pandemic spread quickly, India faced twin challenge - short supply of testing swabs and those imported from China at a steep price of Rs 17 per stick were proving to be inferior.A solution was fixed in 10-days combining the expertise of Johnson & Johnson of manufacturing a similar product in earbuds, and Reliance Industries providing custom-made polyester staple fiber that resulted in the cost of swabs coming down to just Rs 1.7 per unit.While the earbuds typically use cotton and the stick is too small to take throat and nasal swabs, an extender was used to increase the length of the stem and the PSF from Reliance provided lab-approved material for testing.Sandeep Makkar, Managing Director, Johnson and Johnson Medical India told PTI that the entire plan was stitched in matter of 7 to 10 days, soon after the Ministry of Textile contacted the company for a solution to the shortage of testing swabs.Vasai-based Adi Enterprise, which does third-party manufacturing of earbuds for J&J, has started manufacturing the test swabs which are approved by the National Institute of Virology, Pune.It is importing new machinery which will eliminate the need for manual putting of extenders and further bring down the cost to just Re 1 per swab.“Manufacturing of the test swabs in a record seven days from conceptualisation to production under the Make In India initiative required ingenuity and rapid action.“In this design, Reliance provided the raw material and Johnson & Johnson India provided pro bono scientific expertise of research, development, engineering for manufacturing of the test swabs. Production has already started on May 6, 2020, by the manufacturer Adi Enterprise, an Indian MSME in Mumbai,” he said.Officials involved in the project said the move started over a ‘Zoom’ call the ministry of textile did with J&J and Reliance, and within 24 hours Adi Enterprise was given permission to produce a prototype that was sent to the National Institute of Virology.The premier institute suggested modifications that were incorporated and prototype resent. After approval, Adi Enterprise was given orders to manufacture.The company, they said, is making about one lakh of test swabs a day, which after machine automation will increase to 5-6 lakh in 3 weeks time.J&J is making sure the government is aware of the pricing and batches manufactured so as to prevent mark-ups in price or swabs being exported.As capacity scales up, India may begin to export swabs as well, they said.Officials said it all started about 10 days back when Ravi Kapoor, Secretary, Textiles contacted J&J and Reliance to check whether India can manufacture swab required for testing purposes.The two companies readily agreed to take the project on a mission mode with no commercial considerations.Over the next two days, the companies managed to get the polyester shipped to Adi Enterprise which wrapped it around the stem used for earbuds and sent to the National Institute of Virology in Pune for testing.NIV suggested that the length was too small and this was solved by using an extender. Thereafter NIV approved of the design.Adi Enterprise, an MSME, was given charge of manufacturing and it produced WHO standard product under the supervision of J&K and Reliance, they added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-brings-down-coronavirus-test-swab-price-to-one-tenth/story-Jf8DA5UXluwQFi7g0L0Q8N.html
17-05-2020||India||No distractions and time to introspect, devout Muslims find silver lining in lockdown Ramzan||The nationwide lockdown had ensured this year’s Ramzan was going to be like no other in living memory -- no iftaar parties, no meeting with friends, no late night shopping, no prayers at mosques. But many devout Muslims are appreciative the lockdown has helped them stay true to the spirit of the holy month. Three weeks into fasting, many Muslims feel the coronavirus-forced lockdown has a silver lining. It has left them with plenty of time to read the Quran, attend virtual Quran classes and focus on prayers. After all, Ramzan is a time for self-discipline and introspection, they point out.Tanvir Parvez, a lawyer from Ghaziabad, was among those bracing himself for a Ramzan devoid of its usual charms of special prayers in mosques (Taraweeh), sitting with his friends and family to break the fast at iftaar time and gatherings to discuss the teachings of Prophet Mohammad.Parvez, who has never missed the Taraweeh during Ramzan, said he was gutted to learn that this year prayers would not be allowed in mosques due to the coronavirus lockdown.  “I was mentally preparing for a bad Razman experience with so many restrictions in place, but it has turned out to be a very special one as staying at home with family, discussing religion and reading the Quran with English translation has given me a new perspective on life,” the 63-year-old told PTI.  The special prayers, iftaar congregations and spiritual gatherings are being missed, but the benefits have also made it a special “special Razman” this year.“Earlier Ramzans were just about racing against time from the courts to reach home for iftaar, but now I am involved in making iftaar with my wife and though the spread is very simple, it brings the family closer as everyone is involved,” he said.People are also relishing the time they are getting to introspect and learn more about Islam with no distractions such as grand iftaar parties and shopping sprees.Hasan Askari, an agriculturist based in Ghaziabad, said the month usually raced by with a string of iftaar parties and endless shopping trips, but not this time.“The lockdown is proving to be a boon with distractions like shopping and endless iftaar parties not there, allowing me to read books on Islamic teachings which my brother-in-law gets from Jeddah and watching Islamic sermons online,” Askari told PTI.Prominent Muslim body Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind’s president Maulana Arshad Madani said it is heartening to see Muslims finding positivity in these difficult times and using the lockdown downtime to learn more about Islamic teachings and Quran.“Another significant trend witnessed this year is that seeing the sufferings of migrant labourers and the needy, Muslims have undertaken charity at a scale not seen before,” Madani told PTI.Even though everyone’s economic future is uncertain, Muslims are helping the poor with money and food in a massive way to realise the true meaning of Ramzan, he said.Another popular trend this Ramzan has been Muslims watching religious programmes and taking up Quran classes online.Professor Salim Engineer, vice president of the Jamaat-e-Islami Hind, said his organisation is webcasting many religious programmes on its YouTube channel to explain the meaning of Quranic verses and important Islamic issues.“We are also webcasting programmes for non-Muslims. Recently, we shot one with religious leaders from different religions discussing the importance of fasting. In mosques, 1,000-1,500 people would listen to the discussions. This year, many thousands are watching these programmes online during Ramzan,” he told PTI.Iftaar food, normally an elaborate feast with kebabs, kormas and much more, have also become simpler.  Sultana Siddiqui, a homemaker from Lucknow, would spend most of her day preparing the meals. Not this time though.  “Making non-vegetarian delicacies during Ramzan takes up a lot of time. But this year with most meat shops closed and lockdown in place, the iftaar menu is very modest and allows plenty of free time to devote to Islamic learning and preaching,” Siddiqui said.“I have enrolled for online Quranic classes to fine tune my Arabic pronunciation and also to enhance my understanding of the Quran. It has been a life-changing experience,” she said.There are also those missing the festive fervour of iftaar parties and sehri (pre-dawn meal at the start of a fasting day) at old Delhi’s famous eateries.“Ramzan is a time when family and friends come together -- praying, fasting and feasting. With many family members stranded in different parts, the festive feel is missing this time,” said Qazi Aamir Ali, a corporate employee working in Gurgaon.Also, the going is not easy for everyone. While middle and upper class homes are finding positivity during the holy month, the poor and the needy are struggling to make ends meet.“We are fasting through the day and there is hardly anything to eat around sehri. Organisations and people are reaching out, so iftaar is sorted, but we begin our fast just by drinking water,” said Shaheen Bano, an out of work house maid and mother of six.“We pray to Allah and fast that these difficult days will pass, I will go back to work and see smiles on my kids’ faces,” she said.Ramzan is the ninth month of the Islamic calendar during which Muslims worldwide refrain from eating and drinking from dawn to dusk and end their fast in the evening. The month is in its fourth week now and Eid will be celebrated on May 24 or 25, depending on the sighting of the moon.For Muslims, this Ramzan is also about hope that their prayers will be answered and a new dawn will emerge in post-pandemic times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-distractions-and-time-to-introspect-devout-muslims-find-silver-lining-in-lockdown-ramzan/story-82SULeekWnCMrHFWetnPnN.html

We will take full care of them if they want to stay back and if they want to return to their villages, then trains are being arranged to transport them. Under no circumstance will they be left on their own,” the CM tweeted highlighting another tweet by his deputy Manish Sisodia, who noted that approximately 47,000 migrant labourers from the national capital had been sent home in special Shramik specials as of Sunday. For Coronavirus Live UpdatesDelhi houses hundreds of thousands of migrant labourers, who had come out on the streets after losing their livelihoods post the imposition of a nationwide lockdown on March 25. They had to be put up in special relief camps with arrangement for food and medicines till the union government decided to allow movement of the migrant workforce. However, several desperate migrant workers can still be seen hitchhiking rides to reach home, while several others have lost their lives in both rail and road accidents while trying to cover massive distances on foot.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19Kejriwal tweeted a notice issued by the Delhi government directing all concerned authorities including the Delhi Police to ensure that migrant workers are not allowed to walk along highways and railway tracks in an attempt to cover the long-distance home on foot or by unauthorised transport.

17-05-2020||India||Maharashtra reports 587 deaths due to Covid-19 in last 13 days||Maharashtra has reported 587 new deaths due to Covid-19 in the last 13 days, taking the state’s death toll to 1,135, as of Saturday. The first case in Maharashtra was reported on March 11 and till May 3, the state had reported 12,974 coronavirus cases.But in the last 13 days, the total deaths rose to 1,135 whereas the Covid-19 cases climbed to 30,706, as of Saturday, according to state health department data.Whereas in Mumbai, the number of cases and deaths doubled in the last 13 days. From 8,800 cases and 343 deaths (as of May 03), the city reported 18,555 cases and 696 deaths as of Saturday. Maharashtra on Saturday recorded its highest single-day jump in Covid-19 cases with 1,606 new infections, bringing the case count to 30,706.Mumbai on the other hand recorded 884 new coronavirus infections on Saturday, whereas Pune recorded 161 new Covid-19 cases, while Thane recorded 114, Navi Mumbai 105 and Aurangabad 93.Meanwhile, Maharashtra has extended the lockdown till May 31. The fourth phase of the lockdown, which starts from May 18, is expected to have more relaxations for industries and businesses in districts that fall in the green and the orange zones. For the red zone, the state government is open to allowing further relaxations outside the containment area; a decision is expected after getting clarity from the Central government.A senior bureaucrat said, “We are awaiting Centre’s directives for lockdown protocol in the red zone. As the PM had indicated in his last address that the next phase would be different, we expect that more activities would be allowed outside containment areas. The sense among decision-makers is that we have to live with Covid-19.” The Centre is yet to issue guidelines for the next phase, following which the Maharashtra government would issue its guidelines.The state has so far registered 15,181 cases in the third phase of the lockdown, which is higher than the total it recorded in the 19-day lockdown between April 15 and May 3. In the second phase of the lockdown, Maharashtra recorded 11,627 Covid-19 cases.State health minister Rajesh Tope said that the lockdown has helped restrict the spread of the disease in the state. He added that the doubling rate has also increased during the lockdown period in Mumbai and the overall state.The doubling rate — the number of days it takes for Covid-19 cases to double — has improved, he said. The state’s doubling rate is at 11.5 days, while Mumbai’s stands at 14 days.“The doubling rate has increased to 14 days in Mumbai now. This is a big improvement from the earlier doubling rate of 7 to 8 days. Elsewhere in the state, too, we are trying to contain the spread in hotspots. We are working towards stricter enforcement of lockdown in such containment areas, so that cases reduce,” Tope said.The state health minister has already said that Maharashtra would see the peak of the Covid-19 outbreak by June-end. He said that they are preparing for a projection of over 50,000 cases in Mumbai in three weeks. “There are various projects.

We could not send trains to Bihar and West Bengal since these states did not allow it. But [NCP chief] Sharad Pawar and chief minister Thackeray personally spoke to West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee and Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar over the phone. Today, the first trains carrying migrant workers to West Bengal and Bihar were sent,” Deshmukh said in a video message.The trains are being run from parts of Maharashtra to Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Jammu and Kashmir, Jharkhand and Andhra Pradesh.

Congress’ senior spokesperson Anand Sharma said Prime Minister Narendra Modi must “walk the talk” and announce the measures required by giving money in the hands of the poor and small and medium enterprises to help reboot the economy.He noted that there was a difference between providing stimulus to the economy and merely giving loans and credit to people.  Sharma, a former union minister, challenged the finance minister for a debate on the package while raising questions about the announcements made by the prime minister.“The government’s economic package is only of Rs 3.22 lakh crore and is only 1.6 per cent of India’s GDP and is not worth Rs 20 lakh crore as announced by the prime minister,” Sharma said while addressing a press conference through video conferencing.“I am questioning the Finance Minister, disputing the announcement of Prime Minister and challenging the government to disprove me on the numbers given by me and am ready for a debate with the finance minister,” he said.The Congress leader further said the Finance Minister should answer questions and not ask questions instead. He also demanded that the government provide answers to the country on the plight of migrants forced to walk on roads due to lack of planning on the part of the central government.Sharma hit back at Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman for her attack on the opposition party and termed it as “frivolous”, saying the country expects some seriousness and gravitas from the finance minister. He also asked the government to apologise to the poor citizens of the country who have been abandoned and their fundamental rights and legal rights violated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-package-only-worth-rs-3-22-lakh-cr-and-1-6-of-gdp-not-rs-20-lakh-crore-congress/story-4w4cl2kMRrcl76p2CD4aiI.html

NDRF Director General S N Pradhan said in a video message that the federal contingency force is “watching the situation closely from the headquarters and we are in touch with state governments, the Indian Meteorological Department and all stakeholder agencies”. Cyclone ‘Amphan’, according to an IMD report on early Sunday, is developing into a severe cyclonic storm in the Bay of Bengal and can become a very severe cyclonic storm potentially in the next 24 hours, he said. “The trajectory is mostly towards West Bengal, Sagar Islands and probably towards Bangladesh.... But we have to watch the trajectory very closely. NDRF has deployed the teams well in advance. They are either deployed or moving towards the destination,” he said. Pradhan said seven teams of the force have been deployed in West Bengal. These teams are in six districts -- South 24 Parganas, North 24 Parganas, East Midnapore, West Midnapore, Howrah and Hooghly. In Odisha, 10 teams have been deployed in seven districts -- Puri, Jagatsinghpur, Kendrapara, Jajpur, Bhadrak, Balasore and Mayurbhanj. One team of NDRF consists of around 45 personnel. These teams are already been deployed and the personnel are either conducting awareness drives or implementing preparatory measures. Cyclonic storm ‘Amphan’ (pronounced as UM-PUN) is moving over southeast Bay of Bengal and neighbourhood and has been turning north-northwestwards with a speed of six kmph over past six hours, the home ministry said on Sunday.

17-05-2020||India||Bar association urges PM Modi to amend law to allow citizens to seek damages from China||The All India Bar Association on Sunday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to amend Section 86 of the Civil Procedure Code, which restricts the scope of a citizen to sue a foreign government, enabling the filing of lawsuits against China to seek damages for the COVID-19 pandemic.Terming the pandemic a “handiwork” of China, President of the Association Adish C Aggarwala said the government should bring an ordinance to amend the CPC Section which will enable Indians to seek damages from China for the disease that has brought the economy to a grinding halt and claimed 2,752 lives.“The pandemic is the handiwork of The People’s Republic of China. The virus is the creation of its laboratories under orders of the government which is now trying to cover its tracks,” he alleged.The virus, developed with a remarkable ability to mutate, spread and afflict, and with unprecedented rate of mortality, has been deliberately and consciously wreaked upon the world by the Government of China, as part of its design, he alleged in the letter.In his letter to the Prime Minister, Aggarwala, a senior Supreme Court lawyer and President of International Council of Jurists, said according to section 86 of CPC of India no foreign State may be sued in any court otherwise competent to try the suit except with the consent of the Central Government certified in writing by a Secretary to that Government.“It should be noted that above provision allows suits to enforce contractual obligations in respect of trade activity in which a government is engaged but not for damages for commission of tort. There is no logic underlying this distinction,” he said.A law which tends to take away, completely, the capacity of a person to canvass his rights, is itself a nullity, he said.“As the law stands today, there is no other remedy available to an individual against the State of China. An individual can also not approach, directly, the International Court of Justice for seeking damages,” he said.The Doctrine of State Immunity--countries enjoying protection from being sued in courts of other countries --applies on those who have signed and ratified the United Nations Convention on Jurisdictional Immunities of States and their Property (“Convention”).He said India having signed the Convention on January 12, 2007 is yet to ratify it. China too is a signatory but did not ratify it, he said.Aggarwala in the absence of ratification India is under no obligation to exempt China or any other country from being prosecuted or sued in India for any for any violations.  “Any citizen will be entitled to sue in India once CrPC is amended. At International level, anyone can approach only United Nations Human Rights Council. No other court or Tribunal for this purpose,” he told PTI over phone.When asked if verdict of Indian courts will be binding on China, he said,” Yes. Once there is decree from Indian court, then China would be under obligation to pay. If China is not making payment of decree, then decree can be executed from the assets of China in India and the decrees can be transferred to Chinese courts for execution.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bar-association-urges-pm-modi-to-amend-law-to-allow-citizens-to-seek-damages-from-china/story-Tu9zbkiLsdBGihaqYF6qoI.html

He exhausted options to block extradition after it was cleared by the Westminster Magistrates Court and the high court in 2013.The Home Office informed Hindustan Times that the extradition request for Hanif – full name: Hanif Mohammed Umerji Patel – was refused by former home secretary Sajid Javid and was later discharged by the court.After losing in the high court in 2013, Hanif made ‘further representations’ to the home secretary, who for years did not take a decision until mid-2019. The home secretary is the final authority to order extradition after a request has gone through courts. India’s case against Hanif, as the high court stated, was that he was “part of Muslim group which obtained explosives, guns and other weapons and then carried out revenge terrorist attacks on the Hindu community, including two explosions which resulted in loss of life, injury and damage”. Others involved in the blasts were convicted and sentenced.Hanif’s arguments to oppose extradition included risk of torture in a Gujarat jail, passage of time, that he would be denied justice, and that there is no case for him to answer. For the first time, a team was sent from London to inspect jail conditions in India during the trial.Charges brought by India against Hanif and businessman Vijay Mallya who is also facing extradition trial are different but the trajectory of their cases in the UK is similar; Mallya has also exhausted legal options to block extradition and is likely to make last bids on ground of issues that arose after court rulings.For example, health and the incidence of coronavirus in the Arthur Road jail in Mumbai - where Mallya is to be lodged if extradited - are likely to factors. There are reported to be over 150 coronavirus cases in the jail.“One specific argument that Mallya could advance as a supervening event is that the presence of Covid-19 in Indian jails poses a new and unacceptable risk to his health amounting to a breach of Article 3 of the European Convention of Human Rights”, said Nick Vamos, former head of extraditions at the Crown Prosecution Service.“Events can occur after all appeals have been dismissed which would make extradition incompatible with the requested person’s human rights...The law is now clear that, in this event, the case will go back to the high court”.“Mallya would have to establish that the issue arises as a result of a supervening development or event and provide a reasonable explanation why the issue was not anticipated at the extradition hearing or on any appeal”, Vamos, partner of law firm Peters & Peters Solicitors, added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uk-refuses-to-extradite-dawood-ibrahim-aide-and-gujarat-blasts-accused-tiger-hanif-to-india/story-bgUtEeEtehmBfE6uVl5GQK.html

Several others, including army personnel, are also stated to have sustained injuries in the incident.“A judicial inquiry, to find exact details of what happened, has been ordered. The first class judicial magistrate of Longding has been entrusted to submit the report within 15 days,” RP Upadhyaya, the director general of police, said.“Army doesn’t share their operation details with us, but as far as we know there is no search operation going on at Pumao village on Sunday,” Upadhyaya added. Longding is one of the three districts in Arunachal—the other two are Tirap and Changlang—where rebels groups from Nagaland and Assam, like NSCN-IM and United Liberation Front of Assam-Independent (ULFA-I), are active.The three districts are the only ones in the state where the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, (AFSPA), which gives sweeping powers to the armed forces, is operational.“Usually, the army informs the local police before conducting any operation. But since Longding is under AFSPA, they are not supposed to inform us,” Upadhyaya said. According to a statement issued by the army on Saturday night, a search operation was launched on Saturday at Pumao village based on intelligence inputs about the presence of National Socialist Council of Nagaland-Isak-Muivah (NSCN-IM) cadres.“There was a gathering of villagers which started protesting against security forces and resorted to stone pelting. Troops identified suspicious movement and started moving towards a house, which drew two to three bursts of fire on Indian Army party,” the statement said.“Civilians were told to disperse and to safeguard lives and property controlled retaliation was resorted to by firing eight single shots. In this melee, insurgents managed to escape. However, in this crossfire, it is believed few villagers have got hurt and one villager has expired,” it added.The statement said many army soldiers were also injured due to “stone pelting by supporters of NSCN-IM”.However, student bodies and human rights organisations in Arunachal allege the firing took place as a fallout of a meeting between residents of Pumao and the army to discuss reported thrashing of another villager on Friday night by the men in uniform.According to them, a commotion broke out in the meeting and the army team left it midway. This was followed by stone-pelting by villagers on the army personnel, who fired back in retaliation, killing one villager and injuring others.The North East Human Rights Organisation (NEHRO) has filed two complaints with the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) against the 19th Sikh Regiment of the army for alleged human rights violations.The All Arunachal Pradesh Students Union (AAPSU) has also condemned the incident and termed the army’s action as “barbaric”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/judicial-probe-ordered-after-civilian-killed-in-arunachal-in-army-firing/story-RJxAciBaiwcDIN1l4vrEAL.html
17-05-2020||India||States will see Covid-19 peak at different times, says epidemiologist||The COVID-19 would peak at different times in states and there is not going to be uniformity across the country, a noted public health expert and epidemiologist said, suggesting heightened surveillance and forming district action plans to handle the pandemic more effectively. Professor and Head of Life Course Epidemiology at the Public Health Foundation of India, Giridhara R Babu said the coronavirus is in complete ascendancy stage in states such as West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Gujarat, where it has gone beyond minimal containment. There, things will have to be completely different in terms of reducing the mortality rate, while in other states we are yet to see the surge and, therefore, our preparedness will have to continue, he said. But in both these categories we have to make sure surveillance is the only thing which will guide us, because if we lose our guard now, then we will no longer enjoy that success that we relatively have compared to the other countries, Babu told PTI. The only way forward is surveillance. On whether states would see the pandemic peaking at different times and it would not be uniform across the country he said: Absolutely, each State is like a country. We can postpone (the peak) in low transmission areas. Babu, who is trained in Epidemiology (MPH and PhD) from University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), said one should not get bogged down with the increase in number of cases, adding, the goal is to reduce the number of deaths. If your surveillance is good, then you will pick up more cases, and thereby you will reduce the number of deaths, that should be the focus. He said he is worried about silent districts, where there is not even a single COVID-19 reported case. Giving an example, Babu said a few days ago there were no cases in three districts in Karnataka (Davanagere, Chitradurga and Shivamogga) but they have now become hotspots. So, for me, the nomenclature of red, orange and green is completely artificial because it is dynamic and you cannot have such a categorisation for a dynamic process, he said. According to him, it is now known that the number of expected COVID-19 cases in the country is 54 per million (ten lakh) population. He said if a district has not reported coronavirus cases, it should be in the red because surveillance is not adequate. Even in a well-controlled state like Kerala, cases are coming back. He suggested drawing up district action plans, something similar to pulse polio campaigns (which are done three days in a year), for which preparations start three months in advance in terms of micro-plan, which lists every migrant population and temporary settlement. Then, teams are drawn to cover everybody, then there is logistics that are planned, we do not have district action plan for the country (to handle COVID-19). When you open up after lockdown, and if there is a surge in cases in a few districts, they dont know what to do. That terrifies me. Districts should have task force and action plans to handle the COVID-19 pandemic, added Babu, who has worked with World Health Organisation for nearly six years, during which his efforts included stopping polio transmission in Karnataka and initiation of measles surveillance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-will-see-covid-19-peak-at-different-times-says-epidemiologist/story-FJyBR6iJvUL2AhkJwPdpkO.html
17-05-2020||India||Public expenditure on health to be increased: Nirmala Sitharaman||Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said there will be an increase in public health expenditure, which currently hovers a little over 1%, as she announced a slew of measures to reform the sector in the country to brace for such pandemic situations in future.Apart from increasing public health spending, the government has also decided to create a dedicated infectious diseases block at hospitals and establish government diagnostic lab till the block level to strengthen the country’s testing capacity at the grass-roots level. Special focus will also be on ramping health and wellness centres in villages, she said.“The government will be increasing investments in public health to be absolutely ready for such eventualities in future,” said Sitharaman.The strengthening of government lab network in villages will also help in maintaining robust surveillance. The step has been taken specially to keep in mind pandemic situations in future so that clustering is picked up early and containment measures are put in place immediately for a better outcome.“Increasing testing capacity is the key in better managing any outbreak situation that hinges on test, isolate and treat guidelines. This will be a big plus for the public health system,” said an official in the health ministry, requesting not to be identified.The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) will be contributing to building a national institutional platform for one health that will boost research initiatives. Also, the implementation of national digital health blueprint will be expedited to make better use of technology in delivering healthcare services in the country.The health ministry has already released at least Rs 4,113 crore directly for anti-coronavirus disease (Covid-19) activities so far, of the Rs 15,000 crore funds allocated by the Centre for containment. The essential items worth Rs 3,750 crore and testing labs and kits worth Rs 550 crore has also been disbursed.Another significant step was providing an insurance cover of Rs 50 lakh per person for health professionals under Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana.The information technology system will also be leveraged in a big way to meet the demands of the sector, the finance minister said.So far, issuing guidelines for conducting consultations through telemedicine has worked, with the government rolling out e-Sanjeevani Tele-Consultation Services and building capacity by having introduced e-training modules for healthcare and other workers. The launch of Aarogya Setu app is another important step that has led to the identification of several potential hot spots in the country. Close to 100 million people have already registered on the app that also tells people’s risk of contracting Covid-19.“We have also taken great care in protecting our healthcare workers by increasing the domestic manufacturing industry for personal protection equipment and N-95 masks. We have identified some 300 domestic manufacturers who from zero kits to now are capable of producing 3 lakh kits in a day,” said Sitharaman. Experts in the field said these are initiatives in the right direction.“The announcements regarding Rs 15,000 cr allocated for Covid-19 containment and treatment including for essential items and testing kits is a much needed support… Leveraging of IT services for teleconsultation will help patients with non Covid health issues, who were left stranded due to cessation of all non-emergency health services,” Charu Sehgal, partner and leader of life sciences and healthcare at Deloitte India, said in a statement.“Our doctors and health workers have been working under very trying circumstances and without adequate protection. The increase in the supply of PPE (57 lacs already supplied and more than 300 domestic manufacturers producing) N-95 masks (87 lacs have been provided) is the right start but we need many many more supplies given the situation,” Sehgal added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/public-expenditure-on-health-to-be-increased-nirmala-sitharaman/story-Dipsy19htlYYCFvJ03lkRJ.html

17-05-2020||India||Highest single day spike as Gujarat crosses 10,000-mark, amid slow response||Gujarat became on Saturday the third Indian state to record 10,000 Covid-19 infections, reaching the milestone in 58 days. According to state health department data, 350 cases on an average have been reported every day in May as compared with 143 infections a day in April. On Saturday night, the total number of cases in the state stood at 10,989, behind Maharashtra’ s 30,706 and ahead of Tamil Nadu’s 10,585 — the two other states with over 10,000 cases. The Saturday’s increase of 1,057 Covid cases was highest single-day spike in Gujarat as over 700 vegetable vendors tested positive in Ahmedabad. On May 1, there were 4,721 Covid-19 cases in the state. The increase of 6,268 till the May 16, put the doubling rate of the infection at 11.9 days. India’s current doubling rate is 13.9 days, according to Union health minister Harsh Vardhan.On Saturday, fatalities in Gujarat reached 625 with 5.68% death rate. While the national average is 3.02%, 6.21 (West Bengal) with 160 fatalities and 6.1 (Madhya Pradesh) with 239 fatalities are the states with highest death rate.An official in chief minister Vijay Rupani’s office said the government was testing every symptomatic person, has enforced a hard lockdown, created additional medical facilities in all major hospitals, and deployed additional medical personnel in containment zones.“We are conducting round-the-clock monitoring of containment areas and have prepared a medical database of all persons above 60 years of age in the state. Effective monitoring is the best way to check Covid,” said Ashwini Kumar, secretary to the chief minister.The first patient in the state was reported from Ahmedabad on March 19. He returned from Dubai a week before his test results came in. According to the Ahmedabad municipal corporation, between March 1 and March 15, around 6,000 people returned from overseas locations.“Those with symptoms were tested as per the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) protocol, and the rest were asked to remain in home quarantine,” said an official of the civic body who did not want named.Then on March 20, a video went viral on social media, showing a West Asia returnee shopping for vegetables in an Ahmedabad market. Several other videos surfaced, purportedly showing people who were supposed to be in home quarantine moving out of their houses.The first reaction of the Gujarat government to Covid-19 was slow and many people did not abide by guidelines of the lockdown, which was imposed on March 25 to slow the spread of Covid-19, according to Vidyut Desai, the chairman of Academy of Medical Sciences, which is a body of health care professionals.“There was no complete lockdown and contact tracing of patients was not done properly. The government failed to monitor persons coming from abroad to Ahmedabad, Surat and Vadodra, which contribute 90% of all cases in the state,” he said.“The Tablighi Jamaat congregation in Delhi also contributed to an increase (of cases) in Ahmedabad as did huge public gatherings during janata curfew,” he said, referring to the Islamic sect’s mid-March gathering in Delhi’s Nizamuddin that became a hot spot of the disease, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call to observe a lockdown on March 22, but celebrate frontline health care workers at 5 pm by clapping hands and banging vessels. Some people responded by taking out processions.The state began recording a spike after mid-April even as the government ramped up testing facilities . Between March 19 and April 15, Gujarat tested just 29,104 samples. But between then and May 15, the number rose significantly to 124,708 tests, taking tests per million in the state to 1,858.Gujarat health secretary Jayanthi Ravi said on Friday that the high infection count could be attributed to the overhauled testing process. “We have increased the number of labs as well as our testing capacity. Gujarat was among the first states to have a private testing lab,” she said.Mona Shah, the president of Ahmedabad Medical Association (AMA), said neither doctors nor the administration was prepared for the outbreak. Shah said a section of the infected people did not share their medical history with doctors and also pointed out that there was delay in reporting symptoms , which, she said, contributed to a high death rate. Desai said people initially did not cooperate with health workers. He said the state started consulting health experts only when the situation deteriorated.Health secretary Ravi said the state has adopted a multi-pronged strategy, which involves surveillance of affected areas, monitoring every person in such areas and conducting random tests. “It is wrong to say that we started late,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/highest-single-day-spike-as-gujarat-crosses-10-000-mark-amid-slow-response/story-Xwf0h5FoZog2DD55apR1LO.html

However, a neighbour, Kala Jatav, objected to his moving around in the locality by jumping home quarantine and without being tested negative for coronavirus as, she said, this would put others life at risk. The verbal spat led to a clash between the two families.”In the fight, 47-year-old Kala Jatav, who sustained injuries on her head after being hit by stones, died on the spot while her brother Vishnu Jatav, 45, who was stabbed by Kapure Khan’s relative Chhutki Khan, succumbed to his injuries in a hospital in Gwalior on Saturday morning, the officer said. The injured Akash Jatav and Ramesh Jatav are undergoing treatment in Gwalior. Their condition is critical, said police. An FIR was registered against nine people under various sections of the IPC and six people have been arrested.“An FIR under sections 302 (murder), 307 (attempt to murder) of IPC were registered against 9 persons. Six of them including Kapure Khan and three women have been arrested,” the SP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-dead-in-fight-between-neighbours-over-allegedly-jumping-quarantine-in-mp-s-bhind/story-fEXyED29TiRNzTbC5A42tO.html

17-05-2020||India||Mathematical modeling suggests containment of Covid-19 possible||Mathematical modeling studies suggest containment of Covid-19 might be possible but success of containment operations “cannot be guaranteed” since there is efficient human to human transmission, the Union health ministry said on Saturday.It also said there is no approved drug or vaccine for the treatment of Covid-19 as of now and Chemoprophylaxis with Hydroxychloroquine are recommended for healthcare workers and high risk contacts.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“Since there is efficient human to human transmission, success of containment operations cannot be guaranteed. Mathematical modeling studies suggest containment might be possible,” the health ministry said.The government has drawn out a containment plan as clusters posing high risk of further spread of Covid-19 have emerged.The cluster containment strategy aims to contain the spread of the disease within a defined geographic area by early detection of cases, breaking the chain of transmission and thus preventing its spread to new areas.For institutional mechanisms and inter-sectoral coordination at the national level, the National Crisis Management Committee (NCMC) and the Committee of Secretaries (CoS) will be activated. The NCMC will coordinate with health and non-health sectors on issues flagged by the health ministry.“The concerned state will activate the State Crisis Management Committee or the State Disaster Management Authority, as the case may be to manage the clusters of Covid-19,” a document by the health ministry read.There will be regular co-ordination meetings between the Centre and the affected states through video conference, it said.The document said India would follow a strategic approach for possible scenarios - travel-related cases reported in India, local transmission of Covid-19, large outbreaks amenable to containment, widespread community transmission of the disease and India becoming endemic for Covid-19.According to the document, “Containment for large outbreaks through geographic quarantine strategy calls for near absolute interruption of movement of people to and from a relatively large defined area where there is single large outbreak or multiple foci of local transmission of Covid-19”. “In simple terms, it is a barrier erected around the focus of infection. geographic quarantine shall be applicable to such areas reporting large outbreak and/or multiple clusters of Covid-19 spread over multiple blocks of one or more districts that are contiguous,” it said.The cluster containment strategy would include geographic quarantine, social distancing measures, enhanced active surveillance, testing all suspected cases, isolation of cases, quarantine of contacts and risk communication to create awareness among the public on preventive public health measures, the document stated.As far as the evidence for implementing geographic quarantine is concerned, the document said that the “current geographic distribution of Covid-19 mimics the distribution of H1N1 pandemic influenza”. “This suggests that while the spread of Covid-19 in our population could be high, it’s unlikely that it will be uniformly affecting all parts of the country,” the ministry said. Large-scale measures to contain Covid-19 over large territories have been tried in China. Mathematical modelling studies have suggested that containment might be possible especially when other public health interventions are combined with an effective social distancing strategy, the document stated.   The ministry listed some of the factors affecting large outbreak cluster containment.A number of variables determine the success of the containment operations through geographic quarantine which include the number and size of the cluster and also how efficiently the virus is transmitting in Indian population, taking into account environmental factors especially temperature and humidity, it said.The factors also include public health response in terms of active case finding, testing of large number of cases, immediate isolation of suspect and confirmed cases and quarantine of contacts along with the geographical characteristics of the area.According to the document, the authorities will do extensive contact tracing and active search for cases in the containment zone, test all suspect cases and high risk contacts, isolate all suspect or confirmed cases, implement social distancing measures and intensive risk communication as part of the cluster containment strategy.For large outbreaks amenable to containment, the document stated that the strategy will remain the same but vary in extent depending upon spread and response to be mounted to contain it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mathematical-modeling-suggests-containment-of-covid-19-possible/story-NlqTv6QCeU6Gd0YrZoKgAM.html

17-05-2020||India||US will send ventilators, PM Modi thanks Trump||The United States will airlift 200 mobile ventilators to help Indians combat Covid-19, people familiar with the developments said on Saturday, hours after US president Donald Trump made the announcement on Twitter.Trump also said the two countries were cooperating to develop a vaccine for the disease that has claimed more than 310,000 lives globally and infected 4.6 million people.“We stand with India and @narendramodi during this pandemic. We’re also cooperating on vaccine development. Together we will beat the invisible enemy!” Trump tweeted.Trump reiterated the point at his press conference later, referring to his India visit in February, the role played by Indian expatriates in the US and describing Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a “good friend of mine”.“We are working closely with India,” he told reporters.Modi thanked him in a tweet and highlighted the India-US relationship. “In such times, it’s always important for nations to work together and do as much as possible to make our world healthier and free from Covid-19,” he said.Trump did not mention details of the ventilators but a senior Indian government official said the consignment may “arrive by the end of this month or latest, early June”.Each of these mobile ventilators is estimated to cost $ 13,000 (Rs 9.6 lakh at current exchange rates) without accounting for the transportation costs. In all, the ventilators will cost about $ 2.6 million (or Rs 192 million) plus freight charges.The US move comes weeks after Modi acted on Trump’s request to reverse a ban on the export of hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial drug that was championed by the US President as a “game changer” in the fight against Covid-19.Trump has often said the United States is the “king” of ventilators — a respiratory aid needed for severely ill hospitalized Covid-19 patients — as a result of an extraordinary push from his administration in response to early fears of an impending shortage. He has since said the United States has more ventilators than its needs and it will be willing to share them with allies and partners.In a separate tweet hours later, the president’s National Security Council followed up with a full-bore acknowledgement of the vaccine projects. “The US and India are working together to fight #COVID19 and find a vaccine,” it said, adding, “the US-India Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership has never been stronger.” There was no mention of the ventilators.Three vaccine candidates are in various stages of development in separate bilateral projects involving two of India’s leading pharmaceutical companies with robust portfolios of vaccines. Their US counterparts are research units of two universities and the third is a biotechnology company.Diplomats in Washington and New Delhi said Trump’s offer to send the ventilators and his public statements were an indicator of the deepening ties between the two countries and close contact between the two countries at different levels.It also comes against the backdrop of growing congruence of views between the two countries on accountability and transparency on the origin of the coronavirus, reforms in the World Health Organisation (WHO) and even strategic issues such as terrorism and the situation in the Indo Pacific.For weeks, Trump has criticised the WHO for allegedly allowing itself to be led by China’s assessment of the virus when the disease was detected in central China’s Wuhan city last year. There have also been allegations from Washington that the Sars-CoV-2 virus may not be natural and may have been created in a laboratory.That the two sides are on the same page on China and WHO also came across at a seven-nation video conference initiated by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. There was broad agreement on the need to stress on transparency and accountability for the spread of the disease. The emphasis on transparency and accountability at this meeting attended by Foreign Minister S Jaishankar is seen to be aimed at China and the WHO that is due to hold its annual meet on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-will-send-ventilators-pm-modi-thanks-trump/story-FZ88WQBORLPjXqfV72ipwI.html

There are nine people from Tripura who are stranded in Russia. “We were informed by the ministry of home affairs that the northeastern people stranded in Bangladesh, Russia and Ukraine will be brought back. But the dates of their travel are not finalised yet,” Nath said late on Saturday evening while speaking to reporters.Those coming back from Russia and Ukraine would fly to Guwahati and the Tripura government has been asked to bring them back from the Assam city. The Assam government has also been asked to make arrangements for their stay till they move to their own state. Those being brought back from Bangladesh would travel on a bus and enter the state through the Akhaura Integrated Check-post, as per the travel plan. The Tripura government has got a list of as many as 39,799 people who are stranded in different parts of the country. Among them, more than 1,200 people have already returned to the state and another 2,640 are expected to reach from Bengaluru and Chennai. Tripura has 165 Covid-19 cases of which 64 people have recovered, according to latest health department record.

When he walked back home following the Covid-19 lockdown, Tudu shouldered not just the burden of feeding his family but his two sons on a sling.A few months ago, Tudu, a tribal man from Baladia village under Morada block of Mayurbhanj district, had gone to Panikoili in Jajpur district to work in a brick kiln there. After the lockdown was clamped, the kiln owner stopped the work and refused to give him his dues.Finding no other way, the family decided to walk back home. Though his 6-year-old daughter Pushpanjali could walk with his wife Matrika, the problem he was confronted with was how to carry his two sons - 4-year-old and two-and-a-half-year-old.Tudu then organised two slings and suspended them from a bamboo yoke. He put his two sons on the slings and lugged them on his shoulders for the next 120 kilometres till he reached his village on Saturday. “As I did not have enough money, I decided to return to my village on foot. We had to walk for 7 days before we could reach our village on Friday evening. Sometimes it was a little painful carrying the kids on the sling, but I had no other way,” said Tudu.Tudu and his family were kept at a quarantine centre in the village, but there was no provision of food for them. They would spend 21 days there and next 7 days at home as part of the quarantine protocol of the Odisha government.Yesterday, Mayurbhanj district BJD president Debashish Mohanty made arrangements of food for Tudu’s family and other workers staying there.Since lockdown, several migrant workers across the country have either walked, cycled or hopped onto any form of transport available to return to their homes. So far, 1.15 lakh migrant workers who were stranded in other states amid Covid-19 lockdown, have returned to the State. Odisha has reported 737 positive cases of coronavirus so far, of which 600 are migrant workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-tribal-walks-160-kilometres-with-two-kids-on-sling-amid-covid-19-lockdown/story-JLKUOToBfj3gf3EmYj8BIN.html

They are demanding a pass, what should we do?”On Friday, Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla wrote to Chief Secretaries of all states and Union Territories (UTs), directing them to ensure that there is no movement of migrant workers on roads and railway tracks, and facilitate their movement through special buses or Shramik special trains.In the letter, the Chief Secretary had said that migrant workers should be appropriately counselled and taken to nearby shelters and provided with food and water till such time they are facilitated to board the Sharmik special trains or buses to their native places.He had said as the movement of migrant workers walking on roads, railway tracks and travelling in trucks is still being noticed in different parts of the country, it is now the responsibility of all states and Union Territories to ensure that movement of stranded migrant workers who are willing to go to their home states is facilitated.“States/UTs should widely disseminate the arrangements for travel in special buses/Shramik’ special trains amongst the migrant workers and persuade/counsel them that they should not be walking when they can travel in buses/trains,” he said in the letter.Bhalla said that with the cooperation of states/UTs, the Railways Ministry is running more than 100 Shramik special trains per day and is “ready to arrange additional trains as per their requirement”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/migrant-workers-returning-to-native-places-face-hurdle-at-delhi-up-border/story-FXhNhU4vfMzhXEqchWCHjN.html
17-05-2020||India||BJP marks 6 yrs in power, highlights CAA, Article 370||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Saturday released a video celebrating its six “incomparable” years in power and to highlight achievements of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government since 2014 when it was first voted to power. Modi is due to complete the first year of his second term in office on May 30 and officials said any celebration will be subdued and limited to the virtual world in view of the Covid-19 crisis. The Congress hit out at the BJP over the nine-minute video, which makes no mention of the pandemic, saying the celebration amounts to insensitivity towards people suffering because of the crisis. “It is not surprising that the BJP is celebrating, or that they have absolutely no sympathy for millions of people, who have been left to the mercies of God on the streets of India. If they had an iota of sensitivity, they would have observed a minute’s silence to mark the people’s difficulties in reaching their homes without any assistance from the government,” said Congress leader Manish Tewari, referring to the migrant workers. The nationwide lockdown enforced on March 25 to slow the spread of Covid-19 left migrant workers jobless and has forced many of them to walk and cycle back to their homes. In late April, some states started transporting the workers on buses, and on May 1, the Centre started running special trains for them.Despite multiple attempts, BJP IT cell chief Amit Malviya could not be reached for comment. BJP MP Rakesh Sinha hit back saying that Congress leaders would not understand that report cards are only produced by performers.“This is not a celebration but an expression of performance, which has been backed by the mandate of the Indian people. Moreover, report cards can be produced only by those who produce and have the potential to transform the country and not by those who were non-performers in their ten-year UPA rule. Therefore, Congress party fails to understand the empirical evidence of the Narendra Modi government and the Congress argument is ridiculous,” said Sinha.As the party’s supporters shared the video on social media, many reacted by posting pictures of migrant workers making arduous journeys on foot amid the pandemic while questioning whether it was the right time to celebrate. In the video, the BJP has lauded the government’s initiatives such as the Swachh Bharat (Clean India) campaign that was launched in 2014 to eliminate open defecation and the Ayushman Bharat health insurance scheme. The nullification of Constitution’s Article 370 to divest Jammu & Kashmir of its special status and the passage of the Citizenship Amendment Act last year to fast-track the citizenship process for non-Muslims from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh, who have entered India before 2015, have been cited as important events during Modi’s second term. The BJP swept back to power with a bigger majority of 303 seats in 543-member Lok Sabha last year.The criminalisation of the practice of instant divorce among a section of Muslims and the Supreme Court’s verdict in November awarding the contested religious site in Ayodhya to Hindus also finds mention in the video.“The BJP government is now working expeditiously to construct a Ram Temple in Ayodhya,” the voice-over in the video says. The officials cited above said there would not be any major celebrations of Modi’s first year in office and that there have been suggestions including one on holding virtual exhibitions on the fight against Covid-19 that are under consideration. “The information and broadcasting ministry is also planning to seek details from other ministries on the important decisions taken during this one year especially on reviving the key sectors that have been affected by Covid-19. However, it is clear that this is an occasion to fight the crisis,” said one official on condition of anonymity.A second official who asked not to be named said social distancing will play a major role and the activities to celebrate could be limited to the virtual world. “...it is yet to be decided what course of action is to be adopted for the first anniversary. The government is conscious of the hardships faced by the people and any decision will be take accordingly.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-marks-6-yrs-in-power-highlights-caa-article-370/story-fANK2Bi4s8dJdgnXpApk4N.html
17-05-2020||India||Centre sets up an online database to monitor, facilitate workers’ journey||As tens of thousands of migrant workers continue to walk back home, the Centre on Saturday created an online repository to monitor and facilitate their movement in coordination with the state governments.This database, the Centre said, will also help in contact tracing of migrant workers and keeping in touch with them so as to ensure theat the benefits they are eligible for reach them, and to plan their reverse journeys. Through the database, the states will also be able to plan more effectively as they will have the exact number and details of migrants before they arrive, the ministry of home affairs said. The database is currently on the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) portal accessible to government agencies and states. It is likely to be available for access to states/ministries from Sunday, said an official.The lockdown imposed from March 25 to fight the spread of the Coronavirus disease stranded many migrant workers in cities where they were working; many lost their jobs on account of the lockdown and in the absence of public transport they couldn’t travel back home. Many set out walking, or cycling back home, but some were turned back at state borders and housed in shelters. It was only in late April that some states started organizing buses to ferry them back home. Soon after the ministry of home affairs came up with a protocol on their movement by bus, and, on May 1, the rail ministry launched special trains for them. However, there aren’t enough trains and some migrants do not have the documents required , so they continue to walk back home. Those who can afford to, hire trucks and buses, but many are just walking. The format seeks the migrants’ Aadhaar and mobile number, state or origin, address, mode of transportation and destination state. This data will also be collected for all stranded migrants, including students, tourists, and pilgrims. Developed by National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), the online dashboard , National Migrant Information System (NMIS) will maintain a central repository. It will also help the states from which the migrants are departing, and the states to which they are headed, coordinate the movement, union home secretary Ajay Bhalla stated in his letter to all the states/union territories. Both sets of states have to sign off. “This system will help in speedy communication between states without creating additional work at the level of field officers. It has additional advantages like contact tracing, which may be useful in overall Covid-19 response work,” Bhalla added.The states can upload data on the portal.Many states have already collected migrant data. “States will be able to visualize how many people are going out from where and how many are reaching their destination states. The mobile numbers of people can be used for contact tracing and movement during Covid-19,” the letter said.Each migrant worker will be provided a unique ID which can be used for all transactions and Central government ministries will also be able to track movement using this portal. These IDs of people moving by a particular train will be given to railways by the origin state while giving the requisition for trains. Railway minister Piyush Goyal tweeted – “To provide relief to migrant labour, Indian Railways is ready to run Shramik Special trains from any District in the Country. District Collectors should prepare lists of stranded labour & destination and apply to Railways through the State nodal officer.” The home secretary told the states that both individual particulars and special identifiers (origin, destination address) need to be captured to provide facility of contact tracing as more train and bus journeys are planned. “A ready database can be of help in planning reverse journeys in a systematic manner,” he wrote. The central database, government said, can also be used for e-pass generation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-sets-up-an-online-database-to-monitor-facilitate-workers-journey/story-Bxrbb3rZEXi5oNLozSUlOO.html

17-05-2020||India||Cyclone Amphan likely to bring heavy rain in coastal Bengal districts from May 19||A cyclonic storm brewing in the Bay of Bengal lay 1220 km south-southwest of Digha in West Bengal on Saturday and is likely to bring heavy to very heavy rain in the coastal districts of the state from May 19.The state government has geared up for rescue and relief operations.The system is likely to intensify into a severe cyclonic storm by Sunday evening and move north-northwestwards till May 17, regional Met director G K Das said. It is very likely to recurve north-northeastwards thereafter towards West Bengal coast from May 18 to 20, he said. Under its impact, the coastal districts of Gangetic West Bengal, including North and South 24 Parganas, Kolkata, East and West Midnapore, Howrah and Hooghly will experience heavy to very heavy rain on May 19 and 20, Das said. West Bengal Home secretary Alapan Bandopdhyay said that the entire state machinery is prepared to deal with the situation. Disaster management teams are being sent to cyclone shelters in the coastal areas and other places for rescue and relief operations, he said. Bandopadhyay said that provisions have been made for maintaining social distancing norms at these shelters in view of the COVID-19 pandemic. He said that National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) teams are also there for rescue and relief operations. The state chief secretary held a meeting with concerned officials on Saturday evening to take stock of preparations and the movement of the cyclone, he said. Fishermen have been advised not to venture into North Bay of Bengal along and off West Bengal-Odisha coasts from May 18 to 21 and those who are out in the sea were asked to return to coasts by May 17. Sea condition will be very high to phenomenal over north Bay of Bengal on May 19 and 20, the regional Met director said. Wind speed along and off the coastal areas of West Bengal will reach 45 to 55 kmph with gusts of 65 kmph from May 19 afternoon and will gradually increase to 75 to 85 kmph with gusts upto 90 kmph from May 20 morning, the weatherman said. The Indian Coast Guard (ICG) has also prepared itself for maritime search and rescue operations. “All out efforts have been made in the maritime states of West Bengal and Odisha in co-ordination with the state administration and Fisheries department,” the ICG has said.

17-05-2020||India||1 in 4 most-viewed Covid-19 videos in English on YouTube incorrect: Study||One in four of the most-viewed videos on coronavirus (Covid-19) in English on YouTube are factually incorrect, according to a new study that comes against the backdrop of several websites removing a 26-minute viral video called “Plandemic” that alleged that the disease was a conspiracy being promoted by people looking to profit from it.Videos from government and professional sources on the disease scored high on facts but accounted for just 10% of the around 257 million views considered by the researchers from Canada whose study was published in the journal, BMJ Global Health on May 13.“The general public has varying degrees of health literacy. When we consider the enormous volume and diversity of misleading information being generated and spread, it has significant potential for harm,” one of the study’s lead-author Heidi Oi-Yee Li, faculty of medicine, University of Ottawa, said over email.“Given that YouTube has grown since past outbreaks, its reach is greater than ever [the study says 2 billion users daily], and we felt it was important to evaluate whether misinformation was spreading to wider audiences.”The researchers used keywords “coronavirus” and “Covid-19” separately to identify the top 75 most viewed that were in English, shorter than an hour in duration, and excluded non-audio and non-visual content.They said 69 videos met the criteria, and together clocked 257,804,146 views. These were evaluated on facts, quality, reliability and usability. Videos made by the news media accounted for 47% videos.“Our study highlights that over 25% of YouTube’s most viewed English videos contained non-factual or misleading information reaching over 62 million views,” read the study. “Professional and government videos demonstrated higher accuracy, usability and reliability across all measures but were largely under-represented in our sample.”Subscriptions and presentation is what drove views, the author said.“The most viewed video in the study with over 20 million views was produced by a YouTube and television celebrity. Meanwhile, the most popular government video only reached 4 million views,” wrote Heidi. “This is because governments typically use traditional information dissemination tools (e.g. infographics, posters, websites) which is less appealing and may not be as accessible for those who are less health-literate.”The study is limited because of its focus on one language , but is one of the largest such exercises.“It’s a fine study. Although ‘views’ don’t necessarily translate to ‘users’, and to calculate that you may need IP addresses that may not have been available, it does indicate the trend. The Indian context, however, will require a broader explanation,” said P Vigneswara Ilavarasan, professor at IIT-Delhi and social media researcher.The problem may be far worse in India where such videos do the rounds as forwards on messaging platforms.Indians rarely go to social media platforms directly to gain information, Ilavarasan said. “One reason is the legacy issue, where we tend to trust forwards from our elders and superiors without question. Then there is the lack of information literacy where people are unable to detect misinformation and are not good gatekeepers, and lastly there is manipulation where a video can be taken out of context,” said Ilavarasan.“We’re committed to providing timely and helpful information at this critical time... We also have clear policies that prohibit videos promoting medically unsubstantiated methods to prevent the coronavirus in place of seeking medical treatment, and we quickly remove videos violating these policies when flagged to us,” said a YouTube spokesperson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/1-in-4-most-seen-english-language-youtube-videos-on-covid-19-are-incorrect-study/story-Bpnbpavubn0sQMufdIMzpK.html
17-05-2020||India||Health Ministry says urban areas need to improve disease surveillance||Surveillance system for Covid-19 in urban areas should be strengthened and strict perimeter control be maintained in containment zones with Section 144 enforced to ensure people remain in their dwelling units, according to the health ministry’s guidelines on coronavirus management in urban settlements released on Saturday. In most of the cities or towns, the disease surveillance system is not as well organised as in the rural areas, the health ministry guidance document for preparedness and response to Covid-19 in urban settlements said, asserting that this is more so pronounced in these urban settlements. “Hence, the surveillance system shall be strengthened for surveillance and contact tracing mechanism. This would include identification of the health workers in the health posts/dispensaries, Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM), ASHAs, Anganwadi Workers, municipal health staff, sanitation staff, community health volunteers and other volunteers etc,” the guidance document said. An orientation training will be organised by the Chief Medical Officer or Executive Health Officer to train the identified surveillance workers which would emphasize on the basic information on Covid-19, orientation on basic Dos and Don’ts with focus on hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene, environmental sanitation and use of face covers/masks. The training would also emphasise on active case search through questionnaire during field visit, listing and tracking of contacts, recording temperature with handheld thermometer, recording oxygen saturation with pulse oximeter, identification of high risk individuals based on contact history, age, and co-morbidities, inter-personal communication with households for creating awareness on Covid-19 and other essential health service, addressing stigma, health seeking behaviour and other issues, and establishing rapport with the community. Informal settlements within cities that may have mushroomed due to migration have inadequate housing and poor living conditions, the document noted. According to 2011 Census, there are 2,613 towns/cities such settlements with 6.54 crore population residing in 1.39 crore households, representing 17.4 of all urban population, they said, adding that this would have increased in number further since the last few years. An incident commander of appropriate seniority would be identified depending upon the geographic extent of the settlements and its population size and the commander will identify its planning, operation, logistics and finance teams to implement the preparedness measures to respond to a Covid outbreak, the guidelines said. The incident commander shall report to the municipal commissioner, they said. A coordination mechanism shall also be evolved under the leadership of Incident Commander and would comprise of representatives from Health, Women and Child Development, Integrated Child Development Services, Housing & Urban Affairs, Public Health Engineering Wing, Swachh Bharat Mission, elected representatives, prominent NGOs already serving the area, community leaders, etc, the guidelines state. The Covid containment plan for these urban settlements will address the key challenges specific to these areas and implementation of this plan will ensure that the core capacities are available to respond to Covid-19, the document said. Non-Covid services especially immunization, management of communicable and non-communicable diseases, and maternal and child health services should continue to be provided in these areas, they said. “There will be community mobilization to adopt Covid-related behaviour for lifestyle changes. This would include practising frequent hand washing, following respiratory etiquettes, ban spitting in public places, following social distancing and promotion of masks/face covers, avoiding consumption of gutkha, paan, cigarettes/bidis etc. Social distancing will be a major challenge due to many people crammed into very small living spaces, the document states. “While sleeping the distancing can be achieved to an extent by sleeping in opposite direction in a manner that head end of one person faces the leg of the other. Social distancing should be practiced particularly in community water points, public toilets, PDS distribution points, health centers etc,” it said. A contingency plan will also be in place to move high-risk population to alternative or temporary sites, the guidelines said. Social media should be used with appropriate messages to target these population and for refuting fake news and community groups should also popularize adoption of Aarogya Setu application, the document said. Most of the inhabitants of such communities are daily wage workers, who might be compelled to go outside for work, hence, strict perimeter control must be enforced to regulate entry and exit from the containment zone, the document said.“Section 144 under CrPC will be enforced to ensure people remain in their dwelling units. The local administration however must make every effort to maintain supply of essential commodities (food, milk, groceries, medicine and other essential supplies) in such an area,” the guidelines stated. If feasible, the relief centers in the containment zone may be geo-tagged and information may be made available through mobile applications, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/health-ministry-says-organised-surveillance-systems-needed-to-stop-covid-19/story-tHTeAmTk30mhhVZRvkxVZN.html

17-05-2020||India||30 cities to have maximum curbs during lockdown 4.0: Here’s a complete list||With lockdown 3.0 ending on Sunday night, these 30 cities across the country are likely to have the maximum restrictions during the next phase of the lockdown soon to be in place from May 18. The reason for minimal relaxations in these 30 municipal areas is the high concentration of Covid-19 cases which have been detected in these cities. Most of these cities have a number of areas which are still containment zones or fall under red zones. Though some of them have not reported fresh coronavirus positive cases for some time, there are others where the number of positive patients increases day by day.Thirty municipal areas including metro cities Mumbai, Delhi and Kolkata account for almost 80% of India’s coronavirus cases and are likely to have the maximum restrictions under the Home Ministry’s lockdown 4.0 rules, according to the Union health ministry. The third round of the lockdown, first imposed on March 24 midnight, is due to end in about 24 hours.ALSO READ | Lockdown 4.0: What states are saying about relaxationsThese 30 cities in various states will have the maximum restrictions during lockdown 4.0.(Maharashtra)1.

17-05-2020||India||Govt issues Covid-19 response norms for slum clusters||The Union health ministry on Saturday released coronavirus disease (Covid-19) preparedness and response guidelines for slum clusters and unauthorised colonies, a development that comes amid increasing infections in Mumbai’s Dharavi – believed to be Asia’s largest slum which houses an estimated one million people.Experts have warned that cases could spiral up in slums and unauthorised colonies across the country as people live in close proximity in these areas, making social distancing tougher to follow and implement.The health ministry’s guidelines focus on issues that need to be addressed by urban local bodies to prepare a response against the Covid-19 outbreak, which has infected at least 88,000 people in the country. At least 53 new cases were reported in Mumbai’s Dharavi on Saturday, taking the total number of cases in the area to 1,198.“Informal settlements within cities have mushroomed due to migration from villages, and have inadequate housing and poor living conditions… These localities are often overcrowded, with many people crammed into very small living spaces… These areas are characterized by poor structural quality of housing, inadequate access to safe water, poor sanitation and insecure residential status… In the context of COVID (or any other respiratory infectious disease for that matter) implementing strategic interventions such as surveillance, physical distancing, isolation, quarantine and communicating the risk to the dwellers could be challenging,” the health ministry document said.The ministry has directed that a nodal officer (incident commander) of appropriate seniority be identified to prepare the response depending on the geographic extent of the settlements and its population. The person, who will directly report to the municipal commissioner, will identify its planning, operation, logistics and finance teams to implement the preparedness measures, the Centre said.According to the guidelines, the effort against Covid-19 has to be a coordinated among various departments, including representatives from health, women and child development, housing and urban affairs, public health engineering wing, Swachh Bharat Mission, elected representatives, prominent NGOs already serving the area and community leaders while being spearheaded by the nodal officer.These experts will have to draft other smaller details according to the local requirements of an area.The health ministry’s guidelines directed the local bodies to put in place cluster containment strategies that will include active and passive surveillance. They also stress compliance with regard to social distancing, use of face cover, observing hand hygiene and cough etiquette, hospital preparedness and treatment, community engagement, risk management, capacity building locally, etc.There’s special emphasis on maintaining social distancing. “While sleeping, the distancing can be achieved to an extent by sleeping in opposite direction in a manner that head end of one person faces the leg of the other. Social distancing should be practiced particularly in community water points, public toilets, ration distribution points, health centers, etc. Social distancing is to be promoted at all formal and informal gatherings,” the guidelines said.A central government official, who asked not to be named, said: “The onus lies on the local civic bodies to manage the challenges that these areas pose. We cannot not focus proactively on these areas as these are hotbeds for spread of any infectious diseases, and not just Covid-19. The guidelines have laid out dos and don’ts in detail that the local administration must follow to ensure the risk of infection spread is minimised if a case is reported there. It has to be a two-pronged preparedness strategy: prevention and control.”According to the 2011 Census, there are 2,613 towns and cities with such settlements, with 65.4 million people residing in 13.9 million households.Experts say it is the need of the hour to draft separate containment strategy for such areas, keeping in mind the urban settings. “No two urban settlements are the same; so there is a need to draft a micro plan for prevention and containment keeping in mind the local conditions of the area. In Delhi, if you see, there are several types of residential colonies and each would require a specific containment plan, especially those that are densely populated,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, community medicine faculty, Safdarjung Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-issues-covid-response-norms-for-slum-clusters/story-qJejnyI95sDGYxdcB0SMoO.html
17-05-2020||India||BJP asks state units to ensure aid to labourers||Migrant workers left jobless by the Covid-19 lockdown making their way back home on foot despite special trains and buses arranged for them has emerged as a major challenge for the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) as it nears the completion of its first-year office after it swept back to power last year. Three BJP functionaries said the party has taken a serious view of the ramifications of images of poor workers, some with children and families, and their deaths in road accidents on its electoral politics. On Saturday, 24 migrants were killed and over 30 injured in the latest road accident involving them in Uttar Pradesh’s Auraiya.The buses were arranged in late April while the trains from May 1. Many migrant workers have been unable to register to travel since they did not have identity papers.Social welfare schemes for the poor are widely believed to have contributed to the BJP’s return to power last summer with the bigger majority of 303 members in the 543-member Lok Sabha, or Parliament’s lower House.“The party has asked all its state units to redouble their efforts in reaching out to the poor and the needy and ensure that anyone seen walking is provided all necessary help,” said a BJP general secretary on condition of anonymity.The functionary said BJP president JP Nadda had instructed all workers to take the responsibility of feeding over 50 million poor people across the country during the lockdown imposed in late March to check the pandemic spread. The extension of the lockdown has resulted in the closure of workplaces, left lakhs without jobs and exacerbated the situation, the functionary added.“We are the only party that took the lead in providing food and shelter to the migrant workers. Lakhs of workers have turned up so far. The state has not only offered them shelter but also made arrangements for their employment in case they do not want to go back and also provide them immediate cash assistance,” said a party functionary in Uttar Pradesh.In some states, BJP functionaries have been asked to urge migrant workers to stay back and benefit from central schemes such as the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme.“Efforts are also underway by the government to bring unskilled, unorganized workers under the ambit of social security schemes. As was announced by the [Union] finance minister [Nirmala Sitharaman], rental housing and credit facility for small entrepreneurs and street vendors is also being worked out,” said a third functionary, who did not want to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-asks-state-units-to-ensure-aid-to-labourers/story-lPh9mEG471tiuSCTGfKfDP.html
17-05-2020||India||Goa govt bus covers 2,800km to pick up migrants from Bengal||On Saturday evening, a bus arranged by the Government of Goa set off from Darjeeling in West Bengal , after picking up its sole passenger. It was to pick up four more from Kolkata and begin its 2,800 km long journey back to Goa. The bus was dispatched to West Bengal earlier this week and arrived in Darjeeling on Friday. By the time it finishes its round trip, it would have travelled from one end of the country to the other -- and back. Another bus left Goa for Baleshwar (Balasore), Odisha on a similar mission earlier this week. With the number of Goans stranded across the country being too small , the Goa government has decided that, rather than organise trains like many of the bigger states have done, it is better off dispatching buses -- those operated by the state government run Kadamba Transport Corporation or those that have been arranged through private operators -- to help stranded Goans return home. The buses are coordinated by the Interstate Movement Cell that has been set up specifically for the purpose. At least 6,200 people have approached the cell for help in being brought home (in some states the number runs into lakhs) . While most bus trips are of a shorter duration and involve bringing students from Kerala or neighbouring Karnataka, buses by the Kadamba Transport Corporation have travelledas far as Udaipur in Rajasthan and Ratlam in Madhya Pradesh. “The movement is planned through judicious use of buses in consultation with nodal officials of different states,” the state government said in a statement. “Once they register on the Goa government portal, those wishing to be brought back are informed through sms/calls by the control room once the travel plan for a particular destination is finalised,” the statement added. Over the last week, 15 buses have brought back to Goa 241 people stranded from Kerala (Kasargod), Karnataka (Mangluru, Bengaluru, Belgaum,Hubli, Dharwad, Khanapur, Jamboti and Gadag), Maharashtra (Navi Mumbai, Pune), Gujarat (Ahmedabad,Vadodara and Surat), Dadra and Nagar Haveli.“Driving a Volvo is relaxing. However, crossing the state borders, changing routes due to blockages in Red Zones, waiting in long queues for constant security checks was hectic. This was an unforgettable experience,” Savlo Parab, 55, a driver of the KTCL who drove to Ratlam, said. The journeys are fraught with risk; a Goa bound bus that began its journey from Chennai via Bengaluru met with an accident injuring 21 passengers after the driver allegedly dozed off at 4:30 am in Gadag, Karnataka. But barring this solitary incident, the bus-based evacuation model has worked well for the state. “Today, I am proud and feel more responsible. The government has arranged the trip well. Each person was provided with masks and sanitizers, food and other essentials. We did not halt anywhere except for food,” Mahesh Khanolkar, 45, another driver said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-govt-bus-covers-2-800km-to-pick-up-migrants-from-bengal/story-fW8yh50Iuw0nzNuC4mtpRJ.html
17-05-2020||India||Lockdown spells cleaner air with stubble burning at lowest in 5 yrs||The heavily polluted Indo-Gangetic plains have recorded the lowest agriculture residue burning this year since 2016, satellite images from US space agency NASA have shown.Researchers and government officials said of the several reasons behind the decline in the springtime farm fire count could be the nationwide lockdown after the outbreak of Covid-19.“Springtime fire activities (mostly agricultural) over the Indo-Gangetic Plain have been the lowest this year in comparison to the last five years during the Covid-19-led lockdown period,” Hiren Jethva, a researcher from Universities Space Research Association at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, tweeted on Saturday.Although the National Capital Region gets engulfed in smoke from stubble burning during the winter season, particularly in the villages of Haryana and Punjab, rabi crop residues are also burnt during this time of the year across north India. Air pollution is, however, much lower during summer because of favourable meteorological conditions such as strong winds.Graphs and data tweeted by Jethva showed that while in 2016 the cumulative fire count between April 15 and May 15 was around 70,000, in 2020 the figure has come down to around 10,000 during the same period across various north and central Indian states located in the plains. In 2019, the fire count registered a rise, the data shows.Top officials from the state pollution control boards of Punjab and Haryana confirmed that there has been a sharp drop in stubble burning incidents this year till date.“In 2019 there were around 5,768 such incidents in Haryana till May 15. In 2020 we have recorded around 2,430 incidents. The lockdown effect could be one reason. A clearer picture will emerge when the harvest is completed by the end of May and we take the final survey,” said S Narayanan, member secretary of the Haryana Pollution Control Board. “We have seen the NASA maps and analysed fire counts in the National Capital Region. There is definitely a decline in such incidents. The restrictions during the all-India lockdown and the shortage of labour could be the reasons,” said Anumita Roy Chowdhury executive director (research and advocacy) at the Centre for Science and Environment in New Delhi.Though Jethva suggested lower crop volumes could be an additional factor for the decline in stubble burning, government officials said the harvest has been good this year.The reasons notwithstanding, the fall in air pollution levels should come as welcome news. As HT has reported earlier, SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, can cling to air pollutants. Tests conducted in Italy have found the same. Also, air pollution is likely to be a major risk factor for coronavirus disease mortality, scientists have concluded.“There has been a definite decline in the number of fire incidents. The reasons behind this need to be verified -- whether it is because of the shortage of labour, whether crop yield is low this time or some other reason. This could provide some vital inputs for future planning,” said Sagnik Dey, coordinator of the Center of Excellence for Research on Clean Air (CERCA) and associate professor at the Centre for Atmospheric Sciences (CAS) at the Indian Institute of Technology in Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lockdown-spells-cleaner-air-with-stubble-burning-at-lowest-in-5-yrs/story-riZBgY6noMqeB8ih4nNNOJ.html
17-05-2020||India||Covid-19 lockdown: An arduous journey back home for migrant workers||It’s a few minutes to midnight on Friday. Around 35 km from Raipur city, a truck ferrying about 70 migrants including women and children is standing on the Raipur-Bilaspur highway.A bitter altercation is going on between the migrants -- most have alighted from the truck -- and the driver. “Lootat hass tola”, (You are looting us) ,” cries Lalit Banjare a resident of Bemetra district of the state, speaking in Chhattisghari. “We booked this truck from Pune for Rs 1.5 lakh to ferry us to Navagarh tehsil of Bemetra..Now the driver is asking Rs 500 more from each of us”. Banjare doesn’t want to pay up but everyone else is keen to be on their way. . “Thoda door aur hai...jhagda na karo...(It’s only a short distance (home); don’t fight)” a woman intervenes. The truck left Pune on Wednsday. The money is finally arranged but Banjare is almost in tears. The driver looks embarrassed. “The owner demanded ...I am just a driver.”Chattisgarh lies in the heart of India, a link between the south and the north and the east and the west. It shares borders with Andhra and Telangana to the south; Maharahtra and Madhya Pradesh to the West; Odisha to the east; and Uttar Pradesh and Jharkand to the north. Thousands of migrants from Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu cross Chhattisgarh each day to reach Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal. They move mostly at night. A little after the altercation on the highway; Tatiband Square, the entry into the city from Maharashtra and other states is packed with migrants.Two roads lead away from the square -- one to Odisha and the other towards Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.The Chhattisgarh government has arranged food, water and buses for the migrants.“The buses are arranged by district administration, regional transport office (RTO) and NGOs. About 4,000 migrants are ferried to Jharkhand, Odisha and within the state every day,” said Sandeep Kumar, a social activist who arranges buses for migrants at Telibandha square. But some migrants, especially those travelling to locations in Chattisgarh are in a hurry and do not want to wait for buses; others, who have longer distances to travel, wait. Most of those who do not wait “travel by hitching rides on trucks,” said Kumar.Four constables of Chhattisgarh police have worked out a good system. They stop every truck which heads towards UP, MP, Bihar and Jharkand , and get some migrants on board. It’s an informal system -- but it works. “I am here for the last three days... We stop trucks, ask their destination , and urge them to ferry migrants to their destination... The Chhattisgarh government has also arranged buses for them but still most of them travel on their own,” said Chandrahas Verma, one of the four constables. Well after midnight , on the Raipur -Odisha highway, about 60 km from Raipur, a group of 40 migrants are sleeping in a truck lay-by. About 14 auto-rickshaws, owned by these migrants, are parked in the lay-by. The migrants are travelling from Mumbai to Jharkhand in the auto rickshaws. “We started our journey on Tuesday from Mumbai with these auto-rickshaws. My village is about 1850 km from Mumbai... We travel whole day and camp anywhere in the night. Now around 500 km is left,” says Jahangir Ali.“This is the time of Ramzan but most of us cannot fast because we are travelling and it is very difficult to sustain due to immense heat,” Ali adds.The group says most of them won’t return to Mumbai. “It is better to do farming than to get stuck in some big city. We have decided to live in our native village for next couple of years because we cannot survive in big cities,” says Anas, who gives only one nameFurter ahead on Raipur-Odisha road, a dozen migrants are camped near a Dhaba, r waiting for a ride. “We took a lift from a truck from Tatiband Chauk in the evening with the help of policemen. The driver forcibly dropped us here. We have no option now but to wait till morningt,” says Diwakar Ravi, on is way to Jharkand. The Chhattishgarh government says 67,441 of its migrant workers from different parts of the country have reached the state till Friday. These labourers came on trains and buses provided by the state government. According to labour commissioner Sonmani Bora, around 240000 migrants from Chattisgarh have registered with the state government, seeking a ride back to the state. The state has no record of the number of migrants entering it on their way to other states. At Tatiband Chauk , a young migrant worker, travelling from Nagpur to Varanasi is sitting on his suitcase . It’s time to call home. “Raipur mein hun ..kal shaam tak pahuch jaaunga …khana mil gaya hai yahan (I am in Raipur; I will be home tomorrow evening; I’ve got food here),” Saraj Kumar tells his mother.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/an-arduous-journey-back-home/story-XSKFZwDYprqtrLD1ACuxSK.html
17-05-2020||India||35 more migrants die in accidents across states||Road accidents claimed the lives of 35 migrant workers in two states on Saturday, the latest in a string of fatalities among some of the most vulnerable sections of the population who left urban centres in the hundreds of thousands and are on treacherous journeys back home after the nationwide shutdown since March 25 dried up jobs and wages.In two of the incidents, which claimed the lives of 31, the victims were perched on cargo being carried in trucks before they were rear-ended at a high speed. In one of the other cases, the victims were mowed down by a speeding truck when they had parked to refill fuel in their autorickshaw. The deadliest of the accidents took place in Uttar Pradesh’s Auraiya. “The victims were in a stationary truck that was hit by a trailer near a dhaba (roadside eatery). The truck was carrying bags of wheat flour, and most of the labourers were seated on these bags. Most of the victims died when they were crushed under these bags. Some succumbed to injuries on the way to hospital,” said Abhishek Singh, the district magistrate of Uttar Pradesh’s Auraiya, where 25 died. The group, which included people employed as labourers in Rajasthan, comprised people headed to Jharkhand, West Bengal, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. The accident took place around 3:15am and local police officials said they suspected the driver of the vehicle that crashed into the victim’s truck had fallen asleep.On the Lucknow-Agra expressway, another truck driver who is believed to have fallen asleep at the wheel crashed into a parked vehicle on Saturday, killing a man and a woman who were travelling with their five-year-old son to Bihar from Haryana. The duo had gotten off the vehicle and refilling it with petrol when they were mowed down. The child survived the accident. Police said the couple died on the spot and were identified with the help of the driving licence and Aadhaar Card recovered from them. The lockdown since March 25, put in place to slow the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has left hundreds of thousands of people without work, wages and, often, food – forcing most of them to set out on gruelling journeys on foot. There have been several instances of people succumbing to the exhaustion in peak summer heat, while others have been run over on roads and train tracks. On May 13, six migrants walking to their homes in Bihar were crushed to death by a speeding truck in Muzaffarnagar. On May 8, 16 migrant workers were run over by a train in Maharashtra after they fell asleep on the tracks out of exhaustion. In Madhya Pradesh, eight migrants were killed in three separate road accidents on Saturday, police said.At least 29 others were injured in these accidents which took place in Sagar, Guna and Barwani districts.Six of the fatalities -- four women and two men -- were from the accident near Sagar, said superintendent of police (SP) Amit Sanghi. The group was heading for Uttar Pradesh from Maharashtra when the truck carrying them overturned on Sagar-Kanpur Road, 70 km from Sagar district headquarters, at around 10 am.Five of them were killed on the spot and 19 others injured. They were rushed to a government hospital at Banda, where one victim died later.The truck was carrying bundles of clothes on top of which migrant travellers were sitting, police said.A woman who was among survivors said they were three families returning from Nalasopara near Mumbai to UP.In the accident at Guna, a man was killed when the tempo in which he was travelling overturned near Bhadora.Sub divisional magistrate Shivani Garg said that a family from Dharavi in Mumbai was returning from Pratapgarh in UP, where they had been stuck due to lockdown, when the tempo overturned while trying to avoid hitting a bike.In Barwani district, a 22-year-old man, resident of Azamgarh (UP), was killed when another vehicle rammed into the truck in which he was traveling from behind near Gavghati on Agra-Mumbai Road in the afternoon.According to activists tracking media reports, more than a third of the 381 fatalities in road crashes since March 25 – the day the lockdown began – have been of migrant workers returning home. “The remaining crashes have resulted in the deaths of essential workers, such as health care professionals,” said Piyush Tewari of road safety advocacy group SaveLife Foundation. The figures collated by Tewari were based on media reports of accidents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/35-more-migrants-die-in-accidents-across-states/story-roakcbB2UfTRIVBklm1gyO.html
17-05-2020||India||Don’t act as moneylender, give cash aid, says Rahul Gandhi||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Saturday said the government should not be a “sahukar [money lender]” and argued in favour of cash assistance instead of loans to tide over the coronavirus (Covid-19) crisis while warning of an impending economic crisis.“When a child is hurt, the mother does not offer a loan. As a citizen, my disappointment is the [Rs 20 lakh crore] package should not be of loans but for giving money in hands. The government should not be a sahukar,” said Gandhi while interacting with journalists from the regional media via videoconferencing.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday announced the 20 lakh crore economic package to help individuals and businesses deal with the Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdown enforced to combat its spread. Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, who has been providing details of the scheme, on Thursday announced assistance involving free food grains, cheaper loans, and affordable housings as part of the package. Gandhi asked the government to consider rolling out the Nyuntam Aay Yojana, or Nyay, which the Congress had proposed as a social welfare programme in its 2019 national election manifesto. Under the scheme, the Congress had proposed to distribute Rs 72,000 cash annually among 20% of India’s poorest, or 250 million people. Gandhi said the scheme should be implemented temporarily in urban areas while the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) must be strengthened in the rural areas. The Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government introduced the MGNREGS in 2006 to provide 100 days of work annually to at least one member of every rural household. The demand for work under the MGNREGS has surged as hundreds of thousands of migrant workers left jobless by the Covid-19 lockdown have returned from big cities to their homes since late March.Gandhi said he has heard the government was not giving the money because it wants to retain ratings. “Our ratings are made by our farmers, our workers and businessmen. When people will start working, India’s ratings will improve,” he said as he warned the government of an impending economic storm.Gandhi said the most important thing now is to “fire demand and supply”. He added while infrastructure is certainly the key, the government must give money in the hands of the poor. “If you want to start an engine, you have put fuel in the carburettor. The fuel is cash. We must have a national strategy for income. We cannot sacrifice our economy...,” Gandhi said. He said in a short time, small and medium businesses, farmers, migrant labourers and people in the high-risk category need to be protected.Gandhi refused to compare the 1991 economic crisis when the Congress government ushered in the economic reforms with the current situation. He refused to indulge in a political blame game with the government and said his party will apply pressure “pyaar se [with love]” on the government to accept its proposals.Gandhi cited the steps taken by the Congress-ruled states to help the poor and migrant workers. He did not hesitate in contrasting their responses with those where the Congress is part of coalition governments. “There is a difference between Congress and an alliance government. If you look at the Congress-ruled states like Chhattisgarh, you will see a very aggressive strategy. But in an alliance, we try to put pressure through conversations,” he said when asked about the lack of services allegedly offered by Maharashtra for migrant workers.Senior BJP leader and MP Rakesh Sinha said: “Rahul Gandhi speaks like a feudal lord and he considers the government of the day as his fief. This government has been doing everything, taking into account two major aspects – making India an economic superpower and performing on the principle of catch-up. Secondly, another paradigm of government policy and program has been strengthening the economic foundation of the marginalized people of the country who form the majority. Therefore, Rahul Gandhi’s observation shows his lack of understanding of a dynamic government and its dynamic leader”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/don-t-act-as-moneylender-give-cash-aid-says-rahul/story-Tca8WUeATOALAdYkKSkV9N.html
17-05-2020||India||Following industry demand, Centre allows export of woven masks||Almost two months into the lockdown, the central government Saturday eased some restrictions on the exports of masks. In a circular, the Directorate General of Foreign Trade made modifications to its earlier order and allowed the export of non-medical masks made of woven cloth such as silk, wool and cotton, as well as knitted ones. All other masks under the Indian Trade Clarification based on Harmonised System of Coding remain prohibited for exports. On January 31, the government had banned the exports of all categories of personal protection equipment (PPE) but allowed exports of 2-ply and 3-ply surgical masks from February 8, inviting criticism from the Opposition. The textile ministry said that it did so after it was assured by the industry of adequate supply . N95 and N99 masks, which are used by health-workers and Covid patients in hospitals, as well as two and three-ply masks used in surgeries are non-woven and made of meltblown fabric, which ministry officials defined as a “critical component”. “There is a shortage of meltblown fabric the world over, not just in India, and we cannot part with the masks made of the material at this critical point,” an official said. Days before the lockdown was announced on March 24, key government officials in a meeting helmed by the textiles secretary on March 18 pegged the shortage of 10.5 lakh N95 masks and 10 lakh masks. Since then India has reached the capacity to produce 2lakh N95 masks daily, prime minister Modi said during his address on May 19.Ashok Juneja of the Textile Association of India said that as garment industry does not have any orders, the move will help generate income. “The woven ones are washable and can be reused, and in the near future, the usage of masks will increase,” said Juneja.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/following-industry-demand-centre-allows-export-of-woven-masks/story-8Qdr1p2F7XwAcXSLIg3s6N.html
17-05-2020||India||Govt advises buddy system for doctors||The Union health ministry has advised hospitals to start a “buddy system” wherein a team of two or more staffers is formed that covers for each other in terms of ensuring that infection control practices are adequately followed while managing patients.“...Under this approach, a two- or more-person team is formed amongst the deployed hospital staff who share responsibilities for his/her partner’s safety and well-being in the context of (i) Appropriately donning and doffing of PPEs, (ii) maintaining hand hygiene and (iii) taking requisite steps on observing breach of PPEs,” read the health ministry advisory issued on Friday.“It is a way of ensuring that important steps aren’t missed in the entire infection prevention exercise while on duty. There is a possibility one person might miss a step which the other person in the team would notice and alert his or her partner. This is a step taken for ensuring multiple layers of check and balances so that the risk is minimised,” said a health ministry official. The step has been taken amid growing concerns of a large number of health care workers getting isolated for fear of having contracted coronavirus disease (Covid-19) infection, resulting in overall disease management getting affected due to shortage of staff in hospitals.If there is any breach in the protective gear then the team is expected to inform the nodal officer immediately, so that preventive actions can be taken to minimise the risk of infection. The nodal officer will get the exact details of exposure to ascertain whether the exposure constitutes a high risk or low risk exposure, and advises action accordingly.“The health care personnel working in hospitals are at increased risk of acquiring the Covid-19 disease, if there is a breach in the personal protection while managing patients. The health workforce is a valuable and scarce resource. Large number of Covid-19 affected health personnel getting isolated for treatment and their close contacts undergoing quarantine affects the health/ hospital service delivery,” read the advisory.Hospitals have been advised to strictly follow the earlier directive asking them to activate its Hospital Infection Control Committee (HICC). The HICC in the health facility will be responsible for implementing the Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) activities and organizing regular trainings on infection prevention control practices for health care workers. A Nodal Officer (Infection Control Officer) will be identified by each hospital to address all matters related to health care associated infections.“Provisions have been made for regular (thermal) screening of all hospital staff. All health care workers managing Covid-19 cases are being provided with chemo-prophylaxis under medical supervision. Provisions have been made for prompt reporting of breach of PPE by the hospital staff and follow up action…” the advisory further says.The experts also say that there is no alternative to strictly adopting routine infection control practices such as regular hand washing, use of alcohol based hand sanitizer, respiratory etiquettes (using tissue/handkerchief while coughing or sneezing), etc.“The ministry has been time and again issuing detailed infection prevention and other guidelines that must be followed properly by all health care workers. Safety of our front-line health care workers is priority for us as they are the backbone of our fight against Covid-19,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-advises-buddy-system-for-doctors/story-1ZoSraoy4o8zPgCdHmy5rI.html
17-05-2020||India||Need Centre nod to raise funds: Shivraj Singh Chouhan||Several state governments have urged the Centre to relax the provisions of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act which will allow them to raise more funds to spend on boosting the economy which has been hit by the Covid-19 crisis and the ongoing nationwide lockdown, Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said on Saturday.Interacting with journalists through video conferencing, Chouhan said he felt the next phase of the lockdown would give significant room for kick-starting economic activities even though curbs would be firmly in place in severely affected zones.The Madhya Pradesh government could even offer a package to some like salons and barbers as they may have to continue to keep their businesses shut, the chief minister said. Chauhan said his government had assigned top priority to ensure that migrants passing through the state to Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand etc are facilitated.“States have requested the Centre to make relaxations in the FRBM Act to allow them to raise more funds. The Centre is considering this request. Presently, the act allows a state to raise funds amounting to 3.5% of its GDP and if this limit is raised by a couple more points, Madhya Pradesh can raise ₹15,000 crore more which can be used to boost the economy,” he said.Chouhan also called for proper coordination among states to ensure that migrant workers are provided transport to their homes. The MP government has deployed 1,000 buses to ferry migrant workers, Chouhan said.With the third phase of lockdown ending Sunday and Prime Minister Narendra Modi speaking of an “entirely different lockdown-4.0”, Chouhan said the focus should be on speeding up economic activities while ensuring that Covid-19 is contained. “We will have to fight the virus and take measures to kick-start the economy,” Chouhan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/need-centre-nod-to-raise-funds-mp-cm/story-l33UhmD2TGusONC1FpMwoK.html

Scammers impersonate as HR department, CEO, or any other known person and target users by sending messages such as “your neighbour is affected”, “see who all are affected”, “someone who came in contact with you tested positive”, “recommendations to self-isolate”, and “guidelines to use Aarogya Setu”. When recipients click on such messages, they are asked to provide some information, usually personal or financial. The most common form of phishing is from websites that impersonate a recipient’s bank or credit card company, hoping to elicit personal financial information. The advisory, however, did not mention the number of such phishing cases or the rise thereof.Phishing is a cybercrime in which a target is contacted by email, telephone or text message by someone posing as a legitimate institution and are lured into providing sensitive data such as banking and credit card details.The CERT-In or Indian Computer Emergency Response System is a government-mandated information technology (IT) security organisation whose purpose is to respond to computer security incidents, report on vulnerabilities and promote effective IT security practices throughout the country. “New phishing domains are created which are centered around subjects like ‘relief package’, ‘safety tips during corona’, ‘corona testing kit’, ‘corona vaccine’, ‘donation during corona,” the CERT-In advisory said. Pavan Duggal, one of the top cyber experts in the country, said: “ We don’t have strong laws on cyber security and things like phishing are not directly covered by IT Act. The Act needs to be amended.”He also added that the Aarogya Setu app isn’t secure enough.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/phishing-attacks-around-aarogya-setu-app-on-the-rise-says-cert-in/story-1Fqqehn531nf3YU8JvV9BM.html

The police and the ruling party leaders are trying to project him as a mentally challenged person to defend their action,” TDP politburo member Varla Ramaiah alleged.The police commissioner told reporters that the police control room had received a call stating that a person was creating nuisance on the highway at Akkayyapalem area. According to him, the fourth town police rushed to the place and ascertained that the person was Dr Sudhakar of Narsipatnam government hospital, presently under suspension.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19“Sudhakar was in a drunken state and he behaved rudely with the police. He snatched the mobile phone from a constable and threw it away,” the commissioner said. “The doctor is apparently suffering from some psychological problems,” the police commissioner said.Meena said the police took Dr Sudhakar into custody and shifted him to the police station to avoid inconvenience to the traffic on the national highway.“We have sent him to King George Hospital for medical examination. After receiving the medical report, we shall book a case against Sudhakar under appropriate sections of Indian Penal Code,” the commissioner said.In the first week of March, Sudhakar created a flutter by protesting before the media stating that the government was not providing them sufficient N-95 masks and the PPEs meant for doctors were being given to politicians and the police.“We are asked to use the same mask for 15 days before asking for a fresh mask. How can we treat patients risking our lives?” he asked. As the video of his comments went viral in the media, the state government ordered a probe into his allegations and suspended Sudhakar on disciplinary grounds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vizag-cops-thrash-suspended-doctor-tie-his-hands-and-drag-him-on-road-for-allegedly-creating-nuisance/story-PKkAzUstZwSq7oY5b1tPrJ.html
17-05-2020||India||Bihar elections: BJP to hold booth level meets from May 31||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has decided to allow its election booth management functionaries to begin meetings on a small scale with social distancing measures in place as it seeks to resume political activity in poll-bound Bihar, two functionaries aware of the matter said. A state BJP functionary said the first such meeting will take place on May 31 when Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s monthly radio broadcast ‘Mann ki Baat’ will be aired. Assembly elections in Bihar, where the BJP is part of the ruling coalition, are due later this year. The polls are crucial since the BJP lost power in the neighbouring Jharkhand last year while it was unable to form the government in Maharashtra despite emerging as the single largest party. In Haryana, the BJP returned to power but with a reduced majority. The Election Commission has put on hold elections to fill vacant seats in the Rajya Sabha as well as by-elections in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. “We have decided that seven people put in charge of a booth in every assembly constituency will gather to hear the broadcast together and that will serve the purpose of restarting political activity without breaking any protocols,” said the functionary on condition of anonymity.The activity will be started as a pilot in 50,000 of 62,000 booth areas across Bihar. Seven booth functionaries, known as ‘saptarishis’, each will gather to hear the broadcast and exchange their feedback. No person from the general public will be allowed to attend the programmes that will be documented and shared through social media, the functionary said.“Though there is little we can do by way of political activity, like gathering or sabhas, we have decided to bolster our presence at the booth level. Earlier there used to be three people in charge, now there are seven, which includes a woman, and representatives from the SC [scheduled caste], ST [scheduled tripe] and EBC [Economically Backward Class] categories,” the functionary said.Asked whether the BJP’s state unit has begun discussions on how to prepare for the election, a second national functionary said the party’s focus is now on providing relief to migrant workers, who have been left jobless because of the Covid-19 lockdown and have been returning to states like Bihar, and combating the pandemic.“It is too early to start preparing for the election, but as a party that has a strong cadre, we have told our members to focus on issues at hand,” the second functionary said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-elections-bjp-to-hold-booth-level-meets-from-may-31/story-NjHE0GdfNQoxVA960F5fyJ.html

It added he sustained grievous gunshot injuries and later succumbed to his injuries. The statement said that the security forces have launched a search operation in the area to track down the attackers.The policeman was killed on a day when security forces busted a Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) module in Budgam district and arrested five persons, Zahoor Wani, Younis Mir, Aslam Sheikh, Parvaiz Sheikh, and Rehman Lone. Police said Wani also led security forces to an underground hideout. “As per the police records, they were involved in providing logistic support and shelter to the active terrorists of LeT operating in the area,” a police spokesman said.The police on Friday said it arrested three overground LeT workers from Baramulla town. Two operations separately launched in Pulwama district since Friday night have also led to the recovery of arms and ammunition. “This recovery emerged as a big success in thwarting nefarious design of terrorists against security forces and averted a major terrorist-related incident planned in Pulwama,” the spokesman said. It added the recovery is another major blow to Hizbul Mujahideen since the killing of its top commander Riaz Naikoo this month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/j-k-let-hideout-busted-in-budgam/story-FTBWnB4N81O456WjcC5aCK.html
17-05-2020||India||High courts tell states to ensure aid to migrants struggling to get home||On the day the Supreme Court bench said dealing with migrant workers on the roads was the problem of the states and that it couldn’t really do anything about it, high courts across the country issued directions to states on dealing with the exodus of these people, many of whom have lost their jobs because of the ongoing lockdown to fight the spread of Covid-19, and are struggling to get back home. Ignoring the plight of migrant workers who are walking back home will amount to dereliction of duty of the court as a protector of the poor, the Andhra Pradesh high court said on Friday issuing a slew of directions to government officials to alleviate the hardships of the labourers on road.Hearing a public interest litigation, the court said that migrant workers had left their homes and moved to cities for their livelihood and their that toil ensured that others led a comfortable life.Also Read: An arduous journey back home“They deserve more help particularly when they are trekking back with their heads held high instead of living at someone’s mercy ..If at this stage, the court does not react and pass orders, it would be failing in its role as a protector and alleviator of the suffering”, a bench of justices DVSS Somayajulu and Lalitha Kanneganti observed.“The outpost centres established should not be mere takeaway counters. They should be stocked with adequate stock of good drinking water, dehydration salts and glucose packets which should be supplied to migrant labourers who are walking”, the court ordered. It also asked the state to arrange temporary toilets for migrant labourers assuring adequate privacy for women.“Sanitary pad dispensing machines should be organised at every alternate centre at least…adequate arrangements for food should also be made and the same should be distributed to those who are walking on the national highway”, the order said.Also Read: 35 more migrants die in accidents across statesImportantly, the court also ordered the National Highways Authority of India and the police department to use their patrol vehicles to pick up and transport migrant labourers who are facing difficulties in getting to the nearest shelter.“Pamphlets should be printed in Hindi and Telugu informing the migrant labourers of the location of the shelters”, the court said.The state government told the court that transport facilities have already been pressed into service to transport migrant workers back to their home states.“Efforts should be made to convince migrants to stop walking and to take the transportation being provided by the state government”, the order said.The court also directed that its interim directions should be followed till the mass migration stops and all migrant labourers are transported home.Also Read: Rahul meets migrant workers walking back home from Delhi“The compliance of interim measures should be reported to this court with the clear details of the shelters and services provided by 22.05.2020”, the court said.The Madras high court also passed directions to the state and central governments after taking note of the conditions of migrant workers.“One cannot control their tears after seeing the pathetic condition of migrant labourers shown in the media for the last month. It is nothing but a human tragedy”, the Madras high court said on Friday while hearing a petition highlighting the plight of around 400 migrant workers from Tamil Nadu who are stranded in Maharashtra.Previously, on May 11, the Gujarat high court took suo motu cognizance of various news papers reports about the difficulties faced by migrant workers and issued directions to the state government on May 11 to come up with a concrete plan to tackle the issue. And on May 12, the Karnataka high court ordered the state and central governments to come up with a solution so that migrant workers, who are desirous of travelling back home but are unable to do so because of shortage of money to pay for the special trains, are not left in the lurch.On Friday, the Supreme Court decided not to hear cases relating to the plight of migrant workers. “How can we stop people from walking? It is impossible for this court to monitor who is walking and who is not walking”, the top court said. Another plea for payment of minimum wages to migrant workers during the lockdown was also disposed of by the apex court on April 21 without any directions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/high-courts-tell-states-to-ensure-aid-to-migrants-struggling-to-get-home/story-XCgOCWVDh0shtSR1l31epL.html
17-05-2020||India||Covid-19 is the new reality as lockdown exit gets closer||As states plan to exit the national lockdown and restricted travel resumes, social distancing, wearing masks and washing hands will be the only defence against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). With infections likely to rise after restrictions are relaxed and the anticipated second wave hitting the world, some amount of social distancing will have to continue through 2022, said Harvard researchers in the journal, Science, on Wednesday.In India, even with states planning to move towards a staggered lifting of the lockdown, the number of cases will continue to rise because the absolute number of cases is high. How the outbreak evolves over the next few weeks will depend on the lessons learned so far from infection trends, including clustering.“You can’t police social distancing; people must learn to protect themselves. The acid test will be how we behave as we exit from the lockdown in the next few days,” said Dr Ambarish Dutta, associate professor of epidemiology and public health, Indian Institute of Public Health, Bhubaneswar. Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic“Studies show infected people take on average five to six days to develop symptoms, but are infective from day one. Some people have no symptoms and others have mild disease, but still infect others. Lockdowns prevent undiagnosed infected people from stepping out and infecting others, but with less restricted travel, chances of exposure increase, so we need to be extremely cautious,” said Dutta.As India prepares to loosen lockdown measures, knowing who is most at risk of infection is critical. India has finally begun population-level surveillance of random samples, with pool testing for current infection and antibody testing for past infection, to help guide policy and help people protect themselves.Also Read: 30 cities should have maximum restrictions in lockdown 4.0: OfficialThe world’s first study on who is at risk of both infection and severe disease shows that older people, men, obese people, the poor, those living in densely populated areas, and people with chronic kidney disease are more likely to test positive for Covid-19.Unlike previous studies that have established trends from hospital data for the people with severe symptoms, the study, published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases journal, analyses electronic health records of 3,802 people who visited doctors’ clinics in England between January 28 and April 4.“The risk of infection among the general population remains a grey area. It’s important to know which groups in the wider community are most at risk of infection so that we can better understand SARS-CoV-2 transmission and how to prevent new cases,” said study author professor Simon de Lusignan from the University of Oxford, and director of the Royal College of GPs Surveillance Centre, UK.Hospital-based studies have found that being older, male, and having underlying diseases like hypertension and diabetes cause more severe disease and death. The Lancet study has found that most underlying diseases such as hypertension, diabetes and heart disease did not raise susceptibility to infection, as neither did household size.Also Read: 6-year-old untouched by Covid-19 despite 15-day exposure to ill patientsThe only clinical conditions associated with higher susceptibility to infection was chronic kidney disease and obesity. Of 207 people with chronic kidney disease, 32.9% tested positive, compared with 14.4% without kidney disease. Around 20.9% people who were obese tested positive, compared with 13.2% people with healthy weight.The study also found smokers were less likely to test positive than non-smokers, which study authors said was due to confounding factors and because of a protective effect of smoking. “This result does not indicate that smoking protects against infection, and there are many potential alternative explanations – such as smoking hampering the sensitivity of the Sars-CoV-2 test, or smokers being more likely to have chronic cough so being more likely to be tested despite not having the virus. Apart from the well-documented health damage from smoking, smoking increases the severity of Covid-19, and so our findings should not be used to conclude that smoking prevents Sars-CoV-2 infection, or to encourage smoking,” said professor de Lusignan.The study confirmed earlier findings of older people and men being at higher risk of disease. People between the ages of 40 and 64 years were at the greatest risk of testing positive (18.5%), compared with children younger than 17 (4.6%). Around 18.4% men tested positive, compared with 13.3% of women, which suggests that gender differences in poor outcomes are in part related to differential infection susceptibility.Two preprint studies that examined population level risks showed increased risks of Covid-19 deaths in hospitals with older age, male sex, obesity, and poverty. Underlying diseases such as hypertension and diabetes and smoking play a more important role in disease progression and poor outcomes in hospital studies than in developing infection, The Lancet study suggests. The study did not measure socioeconomic factors that raise infection risk, including high-risk jobs such as health and municipal workers.Going out with protection and social distancing is safer than being in a closed environment with infected people because the wind disperses the virus and the sun and humidity make it less transferable in sparsely populated areas.Also Read: Agra attains cure rate of 61 %, 96 Covid-19 patients discharged in 24 hrsThe chances of getting infected from contaminated surfaces such as doors, railings, elevator buttons, table tops and shelves in shops and public places is high, as washing hands and avoiding touching your mouth, nose, eyes or the part of the mask that covers your face is crucial.What works in India’s favour is its demography. “Most of India’s workforce, including the migrants going home, is predominantly young and are likely to recover and become non-infective very quickly. In countries like Italy and Spain, the deaths have been predominantly in older people in care homes,” said Dutta.“The challenge for India will be preventing infection in public transport, retail markets and wholesale markets, which can seed large outbreaks, as evident from Chennai and Delhi wholesale mandis,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/healthwise-who-is-at-risk-of-infection-age-gender-obesity-kidney-disease-poverty-play-a-role/story-ziZpX8r0x8sbWcJf7Oj27I.html
17-05-2020||India||24 migrants killed in road accident in Uttar Pradesh’s Auraiya||More than 20 migrant labourers were killed and dozens were injured after the truck they were travelling in collided with another vehicle in Auraiya district of Uttar Pradesh early on Saturday, reports said.The trailer truck, carrying around 50 migrant labourers, was coming from Rajasthan when it collided with a van coming from Delhi in Auraiya district’s Mihauli area, reports said.“The incident took place at around 3:30am… Most of them are from Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal,” Abhishek Singh, Auraiya’s district magistrate, was quoted as saying by ANI.WATCH | At least 24 migrants killed in accident in UP’s Auraiya, CM Yogi orders probe “Twenty-four people were brought dead, 22 have been admitted and 15 who were critically injured have been referred to Saifai PGI,” Archana Srivastava, Auraiya’s Chief Medical Officer (CMO), said, according to ANI.Chief minister Yogi Adityanath has taken note of the accident in Auraiya and expressed his deepest condolences to the families of the labourers who lost their lives, Awanish Awasthi, the additional chief secretary (home), said.The chief minister has also directed that all the injured must be provided with medical care immediately and the commissioner and inspector general of police (Kanpur) to visit the site and give a report on the cause of the accident immediately, Awasthi said.Tens of thousands of people have been walking home from big cities after being laid off because of the lockdown to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) since late March.Millions of workers were left without work across cities and towns in India when the lockdown was announced on March 24, resulting in the first wave of workers going back to their villages. Every phase of the extension has seen a new wave—the lockdown was extended twice, from April 14 to May 3 and then May 3 to May 17.Before this, 15 migrant workers on their way back home were killed in three accidents, one each in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar earlier this week. On May 8, 16 workers sleeping on tracks were run over by a goods train in Maharashtra’s Aurangabad district. On May 9, five workers were killed in Madhya Pradesh’s Narsinghpur district when the truck in which they were travelling hit the central verge of the road.Police have said close to 100 were also injured in road accidents across states on Thursday, as migrant workers continue to seek rides on trucks, cycle, or just walk on the country’s highways in a struggle to return home. The government, starting May 1, announced special trains for migrant workers, but there are still far too few of them and far too many workers wanting to return home. Some of the workers do not have the documentation required to travel; others have not registered for the trains or buses being run.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/21-migrants-killed-as-truck-collides-with-another-in-up-s-auraiya/story-1T3YPJwRUeSNDqEyZLo3FP.html
17-05-2020||Editorials||Where the relief and stimulus package falls short||Sunday saw the announcement of the final instalment of India’s ₹20 lakh crore relief-and-stimulus package to provide succour to individuals and businesses hit hard by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and the lockdown, and to revive an economy that will shrink this year — by as much as 5.2%, according to one estimate.The need of the hour was money in hand. It’s the reason the $2-trillion stimulus package announced by the United States (US), at 10% of GDP which is almost the same proportion as India’s (the ₹20 lakh crore works out to a little less than 10% of India’s GDP), is a good benchmark. Almost $600 billion of the $2 trillion is payments to individuals, and leaving aside the unemployment benefits and the forgiving of student loans, an estimated $300 billion in cash was part of the pot. Another $340 billion was targeted at state and local governments, much of it for their Covid-19 response. On top of this $2 trillion CARES (Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economy Security) package was roughly another $800 billion in emergency fiscal measures and $4 billion in monetary measures. It isn’t just the US; even the United Kingdom’s package has a significant fiscal component — including wage support for self-employed and salaried (but furloughed) employees for three months (up to as much as £2,500 a month).Interestingly, many in the US believe that more is needed. To be sure, the US has been ravaged by the pandemic. India is relatively better off. Even if that were to be factored in, the fiscal cost of India’s package is just around a tenth of the ₹20 lakh crore. There haven’t been substantial cash handouts, especially to the middle-class (which got no cash), even though it holds the key to reviving discretionary spending. There hasn’t been either income support or wage protection for businesses, and this could result in a wave of layoffs across India Inc, further depressing birth sentiment and demand. Nor has there been any cash directed at the states, although the Centre has pointed out that they have so far borrowed only 14% of the amount they are authorised to (most states are chary about borrowing because their revenue has taken a hit). To be sure, the package has included a flurry of announcements on reforms, including some radical ones. Some of these were previously announced but not implemented; but others are new, and welcome. However, these are unlikely to immediately improve the financial situation of both individuals and companies — which is what the primary aim of any stimulus package should be.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/where-the-relief-and-stimulus-package-falls-short/story-tdWkvnje35iPfQWhPh5xuM.html
17-05-2020||Editorials||The disease travels east||A feature of India’s tryst with the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) so far has been its concentration in urban centres, and the relatively better-off states of western India. Every case is, of course, unfortunate — but the concentration in these regions has meant that these state governments have more resources and are better equipped. This, however, may be changing as the disease travels to other parts of the country. A key policy priority of the government, ever since the lockdown, was ensuring that the disease did not spread to poor and densely populated Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal and Odisha, where the health infrastructure is weak, governance structures are inadequate, and the possibility of rapid transmission is high. This is why the Centre was reluctant to organise travel for migrant workers. The weakness was that it did not supplement this with social safety measures, which left poor migrants without cash and food, and desperate to return. This forced the government to organise trains. Now that they are returning, the cases in their home states are rising. In Bihar, there is now a surge of cases. And this is the situation when a very large pool of migrants have not been tested or may well be asymptomatic. Odisha represents a similar story, with Ganjam district — a major migrant hub — now emerging as a hotspot. These states have low testing. They have inadequate quarantine facilities and anecdotal evidence suggests that enforcement of quarantine is weak. Their district health infrastructure is poor. India will now have to turn its focus east in its battle against the coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-disease-travels-east/story-X6Ez0TLQA4TvfKnH3AmgrL.html
