There is no herd or population immunity against new pathogens such as the Sars-Cov-2 that causes the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), and till herd or population immunity crosses 70%, it will continue to spread. In these circumstances, public health interventions in combination with an effective vaccine may mitigate the situation.India has the distinction of creating a vaccine for a novel virus decades ago, when the Kyasanur Forest Disease was first reported from Shimoga district in Karnataka and is now endemic in Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra and Goa. This vaccine, though crude, is used even today. Shantha Biotech has manufactured the world’s first effective oral cholera vaccine. The vaccine has not been used in India because cholera outbreaks are rare, but it is used all over the world in emergency situations, including in Haiti and Myanmar.The speed with which the Covid-19 pandemic is progressing leaves the world with no choice but to have an emergency-use vaccine ready within six to eight months. We cannot afford to wait for years. In the past, the Ebola vaccine has been rapidly made available. The world already has some experience with coronavirus vaccines against viruses that cause Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Mers). The platforms and proven adjuncts being used for vaccines development are established and have been used to deliver other vaccines. Since we are not starting from scratch, an early vaccine is possible.Most vaccines are being developed to provide immune responses either using pre-fusion or full-length spike protein. The antigen is either expressed in the human body through a messenger RNA or DNA (genetic material) put through a carrier or put in a platform. When injected into humans, the antigen is expressed and builds up an immune response. Before antigens are put into platforms, they are tested against convalescent plasma and monoclonal antibodies in-vitro, ex-vivo or in-vivo. Mice challenge and monkey challenge experiments are also done. Since neither of these is available in India, Indian companies are outsourcing to international companies or laboratories. Special assays using ghost cells are also needed for testing of neutralising antibodies to detect adverse reactions in cells taken from lungs or bronchus.The most promising vaccine is the LPN-RNA vaccine (messenger RNA) being developed by Moderna, which has completed its Phase-I trial with the help of Emory, and has started recruiting for Phase-II. The Phase-I data of this two-dose vaccine, given 29 days apart, is under analysis. The four-messenger RNA vaccine of Pfizer with BNTECH has also moved to phase-I/II trial.In India, Gennova Pharmaceuticals has developed and patented a messenger RNA vaccine that is used with a carrier lipid iron oxide (LION) and an adjuvant known as GLA-SE. Experiments in convalescent serum and mouse and monkey challenge studies have obtained very high neutralising antibody titres.A DNA-vaccine developed by INOVIO Pharmaceuticals has gone into trial in South Korea. In partnership with Cadila Pharmaceuticals in India, the US-based Novavax is using the virus-like particles (VLP) platform, which has been previously used for the papilloma virus vaccine. Using this platform, the company has marketed seasonal influenza, H1N1 and rabies vaccines in India. This vaccine is also undergoing Phase-I trial in the United States (US) and Australia.Oxford University is using a chimp-adenovirus platform to develop a vaccine, which will be manufactured by AstraZeneca in Europe and Serum Institute in India. It is in the Phase-I trial stage. Johnson & Johnson is using adeno-26 platform and pre-fusion spike protein, which has been successfully used by them in Ebola and RSV vaccine trials. This platform is not being used by any company in India.Aurobindo has bought a small startup from Pfizer in the US and is using a vesicular stomatitis virus platform for vaccine development, which is likely to be manufactured in their unit in Hyderabad. The other projects moving fast in India are the CSIR-funded CCMB-Bharat Biotech partnership using a killed-vaccine for which the strain was obtained from the National Institute of Virology, Pune. Zydus-Cadila in India is also in the fray with a measles virus platform. Other projects are using an attenuated viral vaccine, which is similar to the vaccines being developed in China. Immunoglobulins against specific epitopes of Covid-19 antigens will come before vaccines only 1 is available from Israel and a cocktail of 3 are available in United States and are undergoing trials (These provide passive vaccination).There are 110-plus vaccine projects going on at the moment, with unprecedented approaches being adopted by developers. Emergency use of the vaccine is given as soon as they finish Phase-II and move to Phase-III, and mass manufacturing begins taking up the risk of failure in Phase-III. Countries in which they are situated often fund for risk reduction and provide market commitments. This has never happened before.One of the challenges will be to determine who gets vaccinated first. There are several scenarios, one of them is to vaccinate frontline workers, doctors, health care, sanitation and delivery workers. The second scenario is to give them to children, and the last is to conduct ring vaccination around the hotspots to immunise all the contacts and the asymptomatics. The World Health Organization will provide guidance in this matter.Even when we have a vaccine, public health measures will be equally important, including avoiding risky behaviour, keeping social distancing, working on nutrition and access to poor populations and creating a mechanism to avoid animal and human transmission.If trials fail and a vaccine is not available in time globally, the world will have to live with this disease for a very long time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/covid-19-the-search-for-a-vaccine-analysis/story-4k2CzK3CTvVvpSjHb4KygJ.html
14-05-2020||News||How Covid-19 unbundled the school system globally||In the world of education, this must count for a miracle. Schools, colleges and universities insisted for years that online learning was not for them. With the coronavirus pandemic, suddenly, schools were able to make this rapid shift. Within a fortnight, the technology that received a hard push back suddenly became acceptable — even mandatory. It is tough to advocate change and reforms in the education sector. The traditional university and school models have been sacrosanct for centuries. We mocked assembly-line teaching. Songs were written about how schooling was like a sausage factory, and each student just another brick in the wall. The wall remained unmoved. Until now. Schools quickly realised that this disruption could knock them off their perches. Schooling and higher education had been struggling for decades. Higher education survived, patching over issues with structure, tenure, research, purpose, discrimination, ambition, rigour, reach and, of course, funding. Schooling too suffered with learning lag, funding, standards, teacher motivation, pay, and the gap in preparing all students adequately. The elite did better, since money often purchases quality. Excellence and opportunity were not accessible to all students all over the world. Indeed, as we see from the disruption, nor is survival.Institutions adapted. They were right to do so. They needed students more than students needed them. On paper, institutions certified students. Really, students validated institutions by applying. We are in the early months of the disruption, and already, university students across the world are questioning the value of their education and demanding discounts. Despite the huge amount of work that teachers in schools have put in to scramble to maintain continuity where they can afford it, by going online, fees are under threat. Parents don’t want to send their children to school while the physical dangers are high. Schools cannot survive this.The disruption caused by the coronavirus disease laid bare the fact that institutions were not necessarily delivering value. The school is easily unbundled. We just moved classes, connect, and content to online media. Soon, we will become good at it, and extend it to all. A student will be served just as well with an online curriculum delivered by star teachers across the world. Or by supervised study groups in real or virtual spaces. On demand, with customisation, this could be better than the old ways. One does not need to come into school for this. Teachers, too, can learn to create their magic via tuitions or other learning hubs. Certification can easily be independent of schools. The information technology sector has been doing it for a while; scholastic assessment tests are not school-dependent at all. Students can register for any exams across boards, states, and countries. Exam operations can be in neutral centres, or online. We don’t need schools for exams. Administration can hardly be a reason to have schools and universities. Administration is a software now. Neither learning, nor assessment, needs to be tethered to one hub, except to serve regulation. Regulation can reform to support the unbundled parts too.Social and emotional learning can be found in community and group-learning experiences. One does not need specific school structures. Only sport needs local facilities. Even a corporate traineeship provides that collegial experience. A student may do better participating in a global competition or hackathon than writing tests and essays for an in-school assessment. They can find friends in the local park, or football club, not necessarily at school. If school finds itself parcelled out, then it must ask itself this existential question: What is the true value of school?Other sectors have been disrupted before, and so too can education. Ancient universities disappeared, as did entire school systems. It can happen again. The unbundling of the school package has been made visible. Schools and colleges can be disinter-mediated, and students may find it easier to directly access learning that serves their goals. For many, schools were overly rigid, restricting their personal journeys. For others, schools forced a generic pace. For some with talent, schools were limiting. All teachers know that much of their energy and effort at school is spent in boxing in a variety of students into one set of curricula and goals. Schools bind students to them with laws, enforcement, a monopoly on progression, and habit. Schools also bind students to them with the love of learning, with purpose, with direction and support. Schools and universities do provide value, but it is not where they think it is. It is not where it was. This disruption has revealed our vulnerabilities. But it has also given us a reason to seek true value. As educators and as institutions, our task is to answer this question: What is the true value of schools? And then to deliver for value, not to habit or regulation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/how-covid-19-unbundled-the-school-system-globally-analysis/story-ChciGMytuOUZTj78i2esiO.html
14-05-2020||News||Curbing fake news doesn’t impinge on press freedom, writes Prakash Javadekar||There is always a debate about how much freedom the press enjoys in a country. But, in India, the only time when press freedom was muzzled was during the national Emergency in June 1975. At the time, I was a student activist and protested the censorship of the press; many of us were arrested on December 11, 1975, and kept in prison until all the political prisoners were released on January 26, 1977. During that time, a government officer was deputed to each newspaper; this person screened all news items that were to be published the next day. He enjoyed unbridled powers to allow or disallow publishing of any news item without ascribing any reason. My father, then a sub-editor at Daily Kesari, founded by Lokmanya Tilak, was on night duty on June 25 when the Emergency was clamped and on the morning of June 26, he told me that press freedom was over.During that period, many petitions were filed before the Supreme Court of India for restoring all freedoms, but in vain. Though millions fought against the Emergency for 18 months, this dark era concerning the freedom of press remained.In the elections held soon after the Emergency was lifted in 1977, the Janata Party won, and its first decision was to restore complete press and media freedom, which has remained unhindered since then.But I want to focus on something that poses as big a threat to freedom of the media: Fake news.During the lockdown, there has been a marked increase in the circulation of fake news pushed through print, electronic, and especially social media such as Twitter, Facebook and WhatsApp.To check this menace, we established a Fact Check Unit in the Press Information Bureau (PIB) that started taking immediate cognisance of fake news. Our efforts have started showing positive results. At least some platforms are retracting these fake news items, and placing facts before viewers and readers.The initial response from some quarters to the initiative was to term it the muzzling of the media. But fake news can never have anything to do with freedom of the media.Let me highlight some of the things we have had to combat. On Twitter, a famous advocate said that a woman in Uttar Pradesh threw her five children into the Gomti river because the family had no food. But, when the facts were checked, it was found that there was enough food in her house; she took this extreme step following an altercation with her husband.An even more mischievous piece of fake news circulated on social media, and nearly triggered a clash between migrant workers and the police at the Bandra station in Mumbai. A large number of migrant workers gathered at Bandra Railway Station based on a fake story that flashed on a TV channel about a special train for migrant labourers. There was no such plan.In another instance, a popular channel reported that all staff of Bikaner Government Hospital in Rajasthan tested positive for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). This was absolutely wrong. There has been a clear pattern of spreading rumours as news, particularly on social media. Many of these have to do with the schemes of the central and state governments. In some cases, these are about non-existent problems with schemes or plans: “Only 2% of the poor are getting food from ration shops”; or “There will be 30% salary and pension cut for government employees”. In other cases, they are about non-existent schemes and plans: “The government will provide free Internet till June end’; or “Hotels will remain closed till October”. Many of these were widely circulated. All are wrong; they were subsequently withdrawn when countered with facts.Fake news also creates panic. After India exported hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) to the United States and other countries, a narrative spread that the country was left with no stock of HCQ for its own people. There were many such stories — one claimed that Jammu and Kashmir was short of medical supplies. Another said that Manipur’s Churachandpur district had no rations. A large newspaper even projected that Mumbai would see 40,000 cases of Covid-19 by April-end, and that the number would reach 650,000 by mid-May. All these were fake. The platforms had to retract the news.While PIB’s Fact Check Unit managed to crack down on these and present the true picture, it is clear that there is a deliberate attempt to create fake news.That cannot be allowed in a pluralistic democratic set-up like India, not even if the purveyors of fake news try to portray it as a crackdown on the freedom of the press.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/curbing-fake-news-doesn-t-impinge-on-press-freedom-analysis/story-exHcTkSyVMjFqWQwKCPvYI.html
14-05-2020||News||Financing the Covid-19 economic package||The wait is over. It came in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s fifth address to the nation in two months. The ending of his speech, which incorporated everything from Bharatiya sanskriti (culture) to solar energy, went off like a bomb. Just when most observers of the government’s actions since the coronavirus pandemic had more or less given up on its announcing an economic package, one far greater than expected was announced. During the silence from the central government, some well-designed packages had been proposed from the outside. One by the Opposition had proposed a package of over Rs 5 lakh crore. This concentrated on relief. While relief is vital and something expected from a government that implemented a lockdown without debate, it cannot address the subsequent revival of the economy. A package representing wider concerns and greater heft, amounting to Rs 15 lakh crore, came from an industry body. At Rs 20 lakh crore, the package announced by the prime minister exceeds even the latter. Coincidentally, it exactly matches the quantum recommended in a proposal made in an article in these pages on April 15. A difference is that while the latter had proposed a pure fiscal stimulus of Rs 20 lakh crore, the prime minister’s package includes the financial implications of measures taken by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) so far and some relief offered in March. It is, therefore, a measure of the combined monetary and fiscal policy response to the exigencies of the moment. However, even if the monetary measures are taken to a sum of over Rs 4 lakh crore, the package is large indeed. At close to 10% of GDP, the stimulus is only slightly lower than what has been announced in the United States. The political element in the magnitude of the response cannot be overlooked. The announcement has come at a time when cases of infection in India are not just rising, but rising fast even though the world’s most stringent lockdown, with associated hardship, has been in place for seven weeks. The economy could no longer be ignored. While the content of the package will slowly emerge, the prime minister’s speech suggests that it is comprehensive, covering most sectors of the economy. However, apart from the possibility that political considerations may end up spreading the outlay thinly, a technical issue remains. Of the four areas of focus mentioned, liquidity is one; land, labour and laws are the others. Now, while liquidity enhancement by RBI is important, global experience points to its weakness as a method of reviving an economy that is in crisis. A central bank may enhance the capacity of banks through repo operations, but it cannot force them to lend. Judging by the volume of funds the latter have parked with RBI, it may be concluded that they are reluctant to do so, making it the right moment to contemplate negative interest rests on these holdings. The point is that the greater the share of liquidity-enhancing measures in this economic package, the less potent it will be.After we have acknowledged the boldness of the announcement, we would be interested in knowing how the additional outlay is to be financed. For the moment, the government should seriously consider the money financing route as funding the deficit will raise interest rates. An objection encountered is that the former is inevitably inflationary. Actually, it is not more so than monetary easing implemented by the central bank. For close to six decades, after the founding of RBI, money financing was routine. In the mid-1950s, there was much hand- wringing that the second five year plan was being deficit-financed. There was some inflation all right, but in seven years after launching the plan, the economy had sloughed-off the colonial rate of growth prevailing for half a century. By the time money financing of the central government’s deficit was discontinued in the 1990s, growth had accelerated two more times. Actually, a period of high inflation came after 2008, well after money financing was discontinued. But recognising the possibility of inflation, the increased outlay now planned may be spent in tranches, holding expenditure back if there is a spurt in inflation. In addition to inflation, some Indian economists residing overseas have warned of capital flight if the fiscal deficit were to rise. India’s foreign exchange reserves currently exceed the volume of portfolio investment. Anyway, why would foreign institutional investors want to flee India exactly when, with the economic package just announced, it stands a chance of becoming the world’s fastest-growing large economy?With the technicalities over, the irony of a government that has distanced itself from almost every aspect of the economic policy of early independent India now adopting its very premise is apparent. Self-reliance was the motif of policies pursued in India in the 1950s, and the country industrialised quickly. In the next decade came the Green Revolution, which set the nation free from food imports. By contrast the “Make in India” initiative of 2014 has been less disruptive. May the freshly minted “Atma Nirbhar Abhiyaan” succeed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/financing-the-covid-19-economic-package/story-4AUrzLZadIYLZjH2d5NbFN.html
14-05-2020||News||Why PM Modi’s address is historic||The second stimulus package announced by Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi has gone beyond expectations. His address to the nation on May 12 will perhaps mark the day when India embarked on the path of converting a global crisis into an opportunity to accelerate its economic transition and build on the solid foundations laid in the first term of this government. This will involve eliminating poverty, improving equity, and raising the living standards of the population in line with their aspirations. It promises to be historical.The PM announced a package of Rs 20 lakh crore or nearly 10% of GDP to trigger economic growth in the post-coronavirus disease (Covid-19)-induced pandemic period to protect the interests of those affected by the extended lockdown, which was critical in the face of the pernicious virus. In doing so, he has overcome conservative impulses within the establishment and laid the ground for a paradigm shift. It is clear that we cannot continue to operate within self-imposed fiscal constraints. Across the world, these are being discarded in response to the deteriorating economic situation. Fiscal prudence has to be understood in a dynamic perspective. It can be achieved by reversing the slackening economic growth rate, rather than through a continued reduction in public expenditure in response to declining revenues. That would be the certain path to a vicious downward growth spiral from which it would take years to rebuild the economy.But the unexpectedly large fiscal stimulus package is only one of the components of the PM’s address on May 12. For me, the promise to undertake bold structural reforms and jettison the incremental approach holds an even bigger promise for India to regain its growth momentum. Without these bold reforms in areas such as land, labour, liquidity and laws, the fiscal stimulus risked being wasted in a one-off consumption hike, whose growth impulse would taper off quickly. With bold structural reforms, the proposed increase in public expenditure will help attract fresh private investment to build new production capacities, raise productivity by absorbing frontier technologies and promote equity through higher efficiency in the delivery of public services. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-governed states have taken the lead by introducing a slew of labour market reforms that will give flexibility to investors to tailor their workforce in line with changes in seasonal demand and output.These bold reforms will also underpin the PM’s call for a self-reliant India, but one which is not self-centred and protectionist. He made it clear in his address that India will continue to participate even more aggressively in global value chains on the basis of greater competitiveness of its domestic firms and industries. This will call for encouraging local production, building local brands, improving logistics and lowering energy costs for domestic companies. This will enable them to achieve economies of scale and technological sophistication for successfully competing in global markets. The PM’s emphasis on India’s continued engagement with global trends in commerce, finance and technology is surely an effective and decisive response to those raising fears of India turning protectionist. Self-reliance with continued participation in global markets and value chains will be the mantra going forward.His call for promoting local products so that they become global brands and capture a share of international markets is timely. As new capacities are created locally, the support from the consumer will propel them to achieve global qualities and scale. The domestic market, though large and growing, is still not enough to afford global scales of production and economies of scale. India’s software industry came of age and achieved global scales and competitiveness with the Y2K phenomenon, mentioned by the PM in his address. Duties on hardware imports were reduced and software companies were supported to achieve this breakthrough. Similarly, India’s readymade garments industry achieved its present scale and competitiveness only through catering to global demand. It should be evident by now that Indian consumers are a discerning lot who are acutely price and quality conscious. The bold reforms emphasised by the PM in his address will help Indian firms to meet the demands of the local consumers while gaining share in global markets.We should not lose sight of the fact that the challenge has just begun. There is a difficult road ahead of us with the global economy showing signs of a perilous downward slide which could well be as steep as in the Great Depression of the 1930s. The pandemic’s full impact on the global and domestic economy is still not fully known. In the coming days, we have to constantly be on guard, looking out for emerging risks and opportunities and responding with agility and focus on these emerging trends. We have started a paradigm shift, which will take us in the direction of becoming a global player by focusing on our strengths and rooting our policies in our own ground realities. We will thus actualise the PM’s call for converting this crisis into an opportunity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/why-pm-modi-s-address-is-historic/story-Ojkj8M0ml5nxqK3HOIueLI.html
14-05-2020||Lucknow||UP to offer industrial townships to firms exiting China and coming to state||Industrial development minister Satish Mahana on Thursday said the state was working on a multi-pronged strategy to turn the Covid-19 adversity into an opportunity to boost industrial growth.“To attract foreign companies looking to shift their manufacturing base from China to India, more specifically to Uttar Pradesh, the UP government will offer them their own industrial townships where their people will live with all the facilities,” said Mahana.He said that the state government has identified 100 to 300 acres of land in different parts of the state for such industrial townships. “For instance, if Japan wishes, it can have a township—a Japan away from Japan--where their people can have residential colonies, complexes and schools etc,” Mahana said to reporters here.He was referring to the UP government’s preparations for aiding Japanese, South Korean and US companies, which wish to shift their manufacturing base from China and come to UP.Mahana said his department was doing meticulous homework and it had prepared a note on all the things that India imports from China--from electrical machinery, nuclear reactors, builders, to man-made filament, footwear and fabrics etc.“From April 2019 to January 2020, India imported different categories of goods worth US $57.93 billion. Now, the country is looking to make ‘local’ the motto as PM Modi has said and we are trying to bring as much as possible of this to UP,” said Mahana.“UP’s industrial revival is returning on track and will soon speed up,” he said.Mahana said that after making a helpdesk for US, Japanese and South Korean companies, the state government would tell them that 150-acre land is available near Auraiyya and 100 acres in the Kanpur-Unnao industrial area.UP TOO MULLING ‘SWADESHI’ ONLYMahana said after the union home ministry’s announcement that the para-military forces’ canteens would now sell only ‘swadeshi’ goods to the staff, his department would ask various departments concerned in UP to have only India brands and no foreign multi-national brands at the UP government’s canteens.‘UP WAS FIRST’ The minister said that the state government was the first to take welfare decisions related to migrants, ration distribution, sustenance allowances when the Covid-19 lockdown came into force.And now, when PM Modi had talked about ‘life and livelihood both’, the UP government will take the lead in industrial revival, he said.“Our strategy for industrial revival and growth is three-pronged. One, to revive and revitalise the existing industries. Two, to give an impetus to industries in the pipeline (such as for those MoUs were signed at global investors’ summit and groundbreaking ceremony). A total of 370 companies, who had signed MoUs have done bhumi-pujan, while 150 had started commercial production. Third to have new companies, whether Indian or foreign, come to UP.” INFRA, AGRI BASE, WATER RESOURCESThe minister said UP had good infrastructure, agricultural base, and good surface and underground water resources for industries.He talked about the new steps that the state government took for promoting logistics parks and warehousing in UP.“We are now offering land to them at only 1.5 times of the industrial rates instead of very high commercial rates. It’s an irresistible offer,” he said.CAPITAL INVESTMENT-BASED INCENTIVESMahana said concessions that the state government would offer to new industries/investments might be capital investment-based instead of GST based.“Quite often, the concessions/incentives based on GST rates lead to confusion and anomalies because different kinds of industries have different GST rates. So instead, the concessions/incentive in UP might become based on the total capital invested.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-to-offer-industrial-townships-to-firms-exiting-china-and-coming-to-state/story-jeBKodxUMUkyv4AkqDxlFM.html
14-05-2020||Chandigarh||Patiala man held for concocting car-jacking, Rs 10 lakh robbery||Police have arrested a 55-year-old road contractor, Daleep Singh Dhillon, for cheating after he concocted a car-jacking and robbery incident on Zirakpura-Rajpura road on Wednesday night. Dhillon had lodged the false complaint to get even with his friend, Surinder Pal Singh, who had left him stranded on the roadside while returning from Rajpura, police say.Rajpura DSP Akashdeep Singh Aulakh said, “Both of them had gone together from Patiala to Zirakpur in a Scorpio SUV (PB-12-Z-0046) that Surinder owns. While returning, they drank, and entered into an argument over a money matter. Surinder stopped the car and left Dhillon stranded in the dead of the night, around 1.30am. Dhillon then concocted the story of the carjacking of his Innova and Rs 10 lakh robbery.” The DSP added that in his complaint, Dhillon mentioned the registration number of Surinder’s Scorpio as that of belonging to the miscreants. Aulakh added Dhillon was caught while he was trying to hide the Innova that he had complained, was snatched from him. A case has been registered under Sections 420 (cheating), 182 (false information), 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the IPC and under the Disaster Management Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/patiala-man-held-for-concocting-car-jacking-rs-10-lakh-robbery/story-1V0gC0UfzVDNilfdyU42PJ.html
14-05-2020||Chandigarh||Former Haryana MLA arrested in liquor theft case||A former two-time MLA and the Jannayak Janta Party’s candidate from Kalayat constituency in last assembly election, Satvinder Singh Rana, has been arrested in Chandigarh on the charges of liquor theft from a sealed godown in Panipat’s Samalkha.Panipat superintendent of police (SP) Manisha Chaudhary said the former Rajaund legislator was arrested from MLAs hostel in Chandigarh’s Sector 3 on the intervening night of Wednesday and Thursday by a team led by deputy superintendent of police (DSP) (crime) Rajesh Phogat.She said he was nabbed for his involvement in a liquor theft case and produced in a Panipat court on Thursday, which sent him in two-day police remand.As per police officials associated with the investigation, Rana was arrested on the disclosure of the people arrested in connection with this case earlier.“They said Rana is one of the partners in the godown, which the excise department had in 2016 sealed for stocking liquor illegally,” an official, who was not authorised to speak with media, said.The action was taken on an April 28 complaint by assistant excise and taxation officer Rajesh Rohila about the theft of 4,500 cases of liquor worth Rs 85 lakh from the sealed warehouse.Acting on the complaint, the Panipat police had on May 11 arrested six people, who gave away the name of Rana.In 2018, a theft was also reported at the same godown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/former-haryana-mla-arrested-in-liquor-theft-case/story-9pIrTNByIyfEGCa0C4rrSJ.html
14-05-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai’s Covid recovery rate rises to 24.33% from 20.55% after change in testing protocol||The city’s coronavirus recovery rate has improved to 24.33% from 20.55% in the past 15 days. As per the data released by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), the number of patients discharged on May 1 was 1,567, which shot up to 3,791 as on May 13. The civic body has attributed the rise in the recovery rate to its revised testing and discharge policy. According to civic officials, mild and moderate patients do not need to be tested before discharge from the hospital anymore. Additional municipal commissioner (health) Suresh Kakani said, “This is one of the reasons but with our rigorous screening and testing method, we are identifying Covid positive patients at an early stage, which is helping in their speedy recovery. X-rays and CT scans have also helped in the early detection of coronavirus patients. Recently, we have started to administer the Itolizumab drug and the results have been encouraging.”On May 8, BMC had revised its discharge policy. Mild, very mild and pre-symptomatic cases will be sent to hospitals for regular temperature checks and pulse oximetry monitoring. The patient will be discharged after 10 days of the onset of the symptom and if fever is not developed for three days. Earlier, patients have had to test negative twice prior to discharge. At the time of discharge, the patient will be advised to follow home isolation for seven days. Dr Avinash Bhondwe, health expert and president of the Indian Medical Association (IMA), Maharashtra, said, “These are recovered patients not cured. In fact, change in the policy was made to make more beds available, considering a future outbreak.”When asked about the impact of this policy, Bhondwe said, “There is one risk; the civic authority has to follow up with every discharged patient every day for the next seven days. If it fails to do so then the chances of the infection spreading is high.”Meanwhile, the state has a recovery rate of 21.39% from 16.33%, with 5,547 patients having been cured and discharged until May 13, as compared to the 1,879 patients who had been discharged until May 1. According to the state health department data, the recovery rate is highest in cities such as Mumbai and Pune, which also have the highest number of cases in the state. Of the total 5,547 patients who have recovered in Maharashtra, 3,959 are from Mumbai and Pune alone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-s-covid-recovery-rate-rises-to-24-33-from-20-55-after-change-in-testing-protocol/story-7g0dYdImNi6bTP9TaiLUTI.html
14-05-2020||City||Ghaziabad CMO asks private hospitals to restart emergency services, Covid cases jump to 169||The chief medical officer (CMO) of Ghaziabad has written to 110 private hospitals and also to the Indian Medical Association (IMA), Ghaziabad, urging them to immediate restart emergency services. This came after he and other officials attended a video conference with Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday. Officials of the health department said restarting emergency services would take the load off the government hospitals that are presently taking up non-Covid emergency services at MMG Hospital and the Women’s Hospital in Ghaziabad.“We have asked all 110 private hospitals to restart emergency services with immediate effect as their nodal officers have been provided training under the Infection Prevention and Control Protocol (IPC). This will take the load off government hospitals and also help non-Covid patients. The nodal officers of private hospitals have been asked to further train their staff and resume emergency services,” CMO Dr NK Gupta said.He said while operating emergency services, the doctors and staff attending to patients are required to use N95 masks and full PPE kits.“If they do not resume emergency services, action can be initiated against hospitals. Private hospitals that are empanelled under the Ayushman Bharat Yojna, the Union government’s free health care scheme, will also get a rebate of 50% on purchase of masks and PPE kits. The rest will be borne by the district industries department through which the purchase will be made,” Gupta said.The office-bearers of IMA, Ghaziabad, said most of the 110 hospitals have resumed services after they were given the IPC training.“The rest of the hospitals will start their services by the end of the week. On our part, we are also taking up training of staff and more sessions will be conducted soon. We will try to have every precaution in place when patients are brought to the emergency and tests of those undergoing surgeries will also be taken up as per protocol,” Dr VB Jindal, president, IMA, Ghaziabad, said.“We have also requested the chief minister to allow us restart OPD services. For this, the government can come up with a protocol,” Dr Jindal said.Amit Mohan Prasad, principal secretary (health), Uttar Pradesh, Thursday said Adityanath has decided to extend the registration of all nursing homes by a period of six months.“The decision has been taken after a video conferencing the CM had with IMA and UP Nursing Home Association. Their representatives had also assured Adityanath that they will immediately restart emergency services,” Prasad said..Meanwhile, the number of cases in Ghaziabad on Thursday — as per state control room for integrated disease surveillance program, directorate of health services, UP —stood at 169, with the district recording 24 cases since Wednesday — highest single day spike for the district so far.The office of district magistrate, Ajay Shankar Pandey, had not released daily figures of cases till late Thursday night.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-cmo-asks-private-hospitals-to-restart-emergency-services-covid-cases-jump-to-169/story-MEZyNgBnxNxUm7szbWcx3O.html
14-05-2020||Chandigarh||Will issue e-passes within 30 minutes for interstate travel: Haryana to Delhi HC||Following an undertaking given by the Haryana government that e-passes for inter-state movement of all persons engaged in providing essential services, including medical professionals, will be issued within 30 minutes of the receipt of application, the Delhi High Court on Thursday disposed of a public interest litigation (PIL). Each e-pass will be valid for the entire duration of the lockdown and can be used for multiple visits, the state government told the HC.The PIL had sought court directions to stop Haryana government from restricting interstate movement of medical professionals. “The aforesaid undertakings are taken on record and the Haryana government is held bound by the same. In the event of breach of any of the undertakings, the petitioner shall be at liberty to file appropriate legal proceedings against the officials of the state government in accordance with the law,” said a Delhi HC bench comprising Justice Manmohan and Justice Sanjeev Narula.Haryana’s additional advocate general Anil Grover gave a slew of undertakings in the court on Thursday.The undertakings included allowing free movement of trucks carrying essential and non-essential goods between Delhi and Haryana (except in containment zones).“Trucks transiting through Haryana will also be allowed. The Delhi-Haryana border will be kept open and manned by security personnel. Movement of essential service providers as mentioned in orders issued by the central government, including private doctors, nurses, paramedics, sanitation workers, staff of Delhi Police, Delhi Transport Corporation, Delhi Jal Board, municipal corporations, high courts and trial courts among others, will be allowed on production of e-passes. These commuters will not be quarantined unless they test positive for Covid-19 or are found to have come in contact with Covid-19 patient,” Grover said.The state government had taken a stand that since about 56% of the coronavirus cases in the national capital region (NCR) districts — Gurugram, Faridabad, Jhajjar and Sonepat — had Delhi link, it will allow back and forth movement of medical professionals from Delhi only on production of movement passes.Taking up the PIL, the HC had on May 8 said that orders of the Sonepat district magistrate restraining the movement of doctors, nurses, court officials and trucks from Delhi to Sonepat constituted an infringement of the constitutional provisions.The ministry of home affairs (MHA) had on May 11 asked the states to ensure that interstate movement of medical professionals, nurses, paramedics was facilitated. The directions came after the issue of restrictions being imposed by some states, including Haryana, was flagged during a meeting between the cabinet secretary and the state governments on Sunday.“Ensuring unhindered movement of medical professionals is essential for meeting public health requirements and saving human lives,” union home secretary Ajay Bhalla had said to the state governments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/will-issue-e-passes-within-30-minutes-for-interstate-travel-haryana-to-delhi-hc/story-7oURPZFYPfjoyCVMIFCaKN.html
14-05-2020||Chandigarh||Curfew relaxations: Was MHA rulebook followed, high court asks Chandigarh administration||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Thursday gave the Chandigarh administration a day to apprise it of whether relaxations given by it were in line with the Union ministry of home affairs’ (MHA) guidelines.“..Prima-facie certain conflict/dichotomy between the orders passed by the Chandigarh administration and ministry of home affairs guidelines are observed…,” the bench of chief justice RS Jha and justice Arun Palli observed, giving UT’s senior standing counsel Pankaj Jain one day to examine issues raised in the petition with regards to violation of MHA guidelines and inform the high court on Friday. The court was hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by advocate Pankaj Chandgothia, who has sought quashing of UT’s May 3 order relaxing the curfew up to May 17. UT had imposed the curfew on March 23 and ended it on May 3 at a time when the city was seeing a spike in the number of Covid-19 cases and was retained in the Centre’s red zone list. The total number of cases have since reached close to 200, with more than 50% being reported post May 3. City’s first case was reported on March 18.Jain reasoned that now with the passage of time more relaxations were being granted. However, the court was not convinced with his argument. The court also sought to know about the guidelines from additional solicitor general, Satya Pal Jain, who elaborated these, and informed the court that it may examine whether there is a violation, but MHA guidelines issued under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, cannot be diluted in any manner and are to be enforced strictly.THE PETITIONThe court was told that the MHA guidelines expressly prohibited opening of all market complexes, but UT adopted its own definition and allowed market complexes on the central roads of each sector to resume business. MHA has only allowed standalone shops and neighbourhood shops in colonies, and all malls and market complexes had to remain closed, the court was told.The ministry’s guidelines also prohibit inter-state movement, except for emergency purposes, but UT has allowed entry of all.It also misconstrued the definition of containment zone. As per MHA guidelines, containment zone will be a residential colony, municipal ward or police station, town, etc. However, UT has six containment zones with ambiguous boundaries, Chandgothia informed the court, adding that till May 3, the entire city was a containment zone. He also questioned why all categories of shops were allowed to be opened even as the city fell in the red zone and why shops were open during a wide window of 10am to 6pm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/curfew-relaxations-was-mha-rulebook-followed-high-court-asks-chandigarh-administration/story-DOTvo2hGe3WAgdXDuJ7A2N.html
14-05-2020||Mumbai||Shift patients to CCCs in other wards if required, says civic chief as BMC starts increasing bed capacity||On Thursday, the city recorded a new highest single-day count of Covid-19 positive cases, as 991 individuals tested positive for the novel coronavirus, taking the total number of cases in Mumbai to 16,738, according to data from the Maharashtra health department. Mumbai also recorded 25 deaths on Thursday, taking the toll to 621. According to data from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), Mumbai recorded 998 new cases on Thursday, of which 364 are of patients who tested positive in various private laboratories on May 11 and May 12. Explaining the difference in BMC and state figures, a civic official said, “There may be a different cutoff time at which entries must have been taken from the portal.”Of the 25 deaths (18 men and seven women), 16 victims had co-morbidities. Fourteen deaths were of people above 60 years; 10 victims were between the ages of 40 and 60, and one person below 40 years succumbed to the virus. Mumbai’s mortality is now at 3.7%.Dharavi on Thursday recorded 33 new Covid-19 patients, and two deaths, taking the total number of positive cases for the area to 1,061, alongside 49 deaths. Seven additional deaths were also recorded in Dharavi the same day, of patients who died on different dates, but were reported as Covid-19 patients to the respective ward office on Thursday.Scaling beds at quarantine facilities for high-risk contactsWith a renewed focus on shifting high-risk contacts of Covid-19 patients to institutional quarantine facilities, especially those living in slums and congested pockets, BMC is now looking to scale the availability of quarantine beds in category-1 Covid care centres (CCC-1). At present, BMC has a total of over 23,100 CCC-1 beds across 260 odd facilities, of which 10,237 beds are occupied. On Saturday, municipal commissioner IS Chahal directed all ward officers to intensify tracing of high-risk contacts in Mumbai up to 10 persons per Covid-positive patient, up from the present average of three. He also directed officers to improve coordination with adjoining wards to use their CCC1 facilities, if any ward is nearing its full capacity for quarantine beds.Wards with large slum populations and numerous cluster cases in containment areas have been moving hundreds of high-risk contacts to institutional quarantine facilities.In Dharavi, 35% of the total cases reported were among high-risk contacts of positive patients. A senior civic official said, “One of the ways forward is large-scale institutional quarantining of contacts who live in slums and congested areas. Beyond containing the area, high-risk people also need to be shifted out to ensure minimum spread of the virus. Such areas have small homes, single rooms shared by four to five people, community toilets.” Wards such as the G North (Dharavi, Dadar, Mahim), has over 2,450 CCC1 beds, of which 718 are presently occupied. BMC has traced 6,496 high-risk contacts of 1,036 cases in Dharavi, as of Wednesday, and institutionally quarantined 5,857 residents through the course of one month.“Our focus is to scale up beds capacity in existing facilities, as it is faster. We already have a setup of doctors, nurses, and arrangements for food. In my ward, I have identified Mahim Nature Park which will accommodate at least 650 odd beds,” said Dighavkar.E ward has used 378 beds as of Tuesday, nearing its total CCC-1 bed capacity. A civic official from the ward said, “Our doubling rate has gone up to 14 days (as of Tuesday), from eight or nine days. Now the cases per day are coming down to 15 -30. The situation is improving due to contact tracing measures.” Makarand Dagadkhair, assistant commissioner from E ward, said on Tuesday, “Around 80% of the cases are from pockets with community toilets, slums, and chawls. We are still increasing our contact tracing efforts, door-to-door screening, and containment policy.”In H East ward (Bandra East), which has around 800 CCC1 beds, 90% of them are occupied by high-risk contacts. However, assistant commissioner of the H/E ward, Ashok Khairnar said, “I’m scaling up beds at CCC1 to reach 1,100 in the next two days. We have already identified the locations.”M East ward, which has the large slum pockets of Govandi and Mankhurd, has the highest number of CCC1 beds among the 24 wards. The institutional quarantine facilities have 4,000 beds, of which only around 750 are currently occupied.Scaling beds for mild-symptomatic and asymptomatic patients In a press release on Thursday, BMC said it is also scaling up bed capacity for CCC-2 centres, where patients who are asymptomatic or show mild symptoms, are quarantined. CCC-2 bed capacity has been expanded to 34,329 across 241 facilities. BMC hopes to decongest hospitals by scaling up these facilities.Many CCC-2 have been upgraded to have oxygen outlets and ICU facilities. This includes the Mithaghar school in Mulund which has 10 ICU beds and NSCI dome at Worli with 70 ICU beds. The CCC-2 at MMRDA grounds in Bandra Kurla Complex will have 1000 beds and the Nesco exhibition centre at Goregaon will be equipped with 1,240 beds.Beds for non-Covid patients BMC has freed up 7,500 beds to treat patients suffering from illnesses other than Covid-19, across tertiary and peripheral municipal hospitals of the city. A total of 3,539 beds have been made available at Sion hospital (1,278 beds); KEM Hospital (1,711 beds), and Cooper Hospital (550 beds).Mumbai’s 18 peripheral hospitals have a total of 3,076 beds and 28 maternity homes have 899 beds for non-Covid patients. Those with illnesses not related to the coronavirus, who have difficulty accessing healthcare, can get help via BMC’s helpline 1916.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/shift-patients-to-cccs-in-other-wards-if-required-says-civic-chief-as-bmc-starts-increasing-bed-capacity/story-HkNuEQOVLnV1esDpess2yO.html
14-05-2020||Mumbai||Researchers at IISER develop low-cost ventilator||Researchers at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune, have developed a low-cost mechanical ventilator —a hybrid version of a ventilator developed in US and Italy — to bridge the demand-supply gap owing to the Covid-19 outbreak.Developing cheap ventilators is important as per a recent paper by the Centre for Disease Dynamics, Economics and Policy that has estimated that India has approximately 1.9 million hospitals beds, 95,000 ICU beds and 48,000 ventilators. Most beds and ventilators are concentrated in Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Telangana and Kerala.“Critical Covid patients need a ventilator that is slightly more advanced in terms of features and usability,” said Umakant D Rapol, associate professor, physics department, IISER. “We have kept the ventilator simple yet efficient by incorporating design requirements and almost all functionalities that a doctor requires to treat patients,” he addedStating that the prototype costs between Rs 30,000-40,000, Sunil Nair, associate professor, physics department, IISER, said the ventilator has been tested for about half a million cycles in the laboratory. The advanced full-fledged version of the ventilator — it is a microprocessor-based system — will be ready in two weeks following which the team will collaborate with clinicians for evaluation and mass production.The idea to develop the ventilator was an offshoot of another project initiated by the institute’s international office. “When we were asked to help in designing and development of a mechanical ventilator, known as the Bharucha ventilator in which we are still involved, we realised that it was a very basic machine that would not suffice for the use of Covid-19 patients,” said Nair. “We also got to know about a couple of open-source ventilators that were released — Mechanical Ventilator Milano and another one by the University of Florida. This got us thinking about how we could implement the ventilators in the Indian context.” Having zeroed in on the two designs, the team comprising professors, a technical officer along with two former students pursuing their studies in Canada and Denmark started building the prototype on April 2. “We ended up designing a hybrid version, which meets most of the specifications of the US and Italian models, with our materials. It was difficult to obtain many components due to the lockdown,” said Rapol. “The ventilator can be locally manufactured without relying on imported components,” he added. Essentially, the prototype comprises three primary modes of operation such as continuous positive airway pressure with different parameters (breaths per minute, for instance) delivered to the patient that can be chosen by the operator from the front screen.Working on compressed air from the hospital or a dedicated compressor that provides clean air, the ventilator is also equipped with an additional self-assisted mode — the machine supports breathing which is initiated by the patient based on appropriate upper or lower air pressure triggers that are set by the operator. Researchers said one can remotely control and monitor the parameters of both the ventilator and the patient. One can also use a single computer to interact with many similar ventilators in a hospital, and monitor various parameters on a mobile phone. Tarun Souradeep, professor and chair physics at the institute, said, “Building this low-cost ventilator is a good initiative since they have used their capabilities of building instruments, which is rare in science departments because experimentalists are largely used to running expensive instruments that are purchased for laboratories.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/researchers-at-iiser-develop-low-cost-ventilator/story-fI1UQsQAuNslAlqE8IYbeP.html

Worker’s union leader Shashank Rao said, BEST drivers and conductors are frontline workers during the Covid-19 crisis. Union has been repeatedly demanding protection for workers who were exposed” to the virus and alleged that the administration has done precious little. “We have waited for long and now we want all workers to be safe and stay home from Monday if the management fails to give us facilities for a safe working environment,’’ he said.BEST general manager Surendrakumar Bagde said he had not received a complaint from any worker and the undertaking was providing protection and medical care to all workers besides special allowances at work.As per BSKKS, BEST administration should provide proper quarantine and hospitalisation facilities with proper food, water, medicines, being arranged by the undertaking.BSKKS demands include comprehensive medical insurance of ₹1 crore for employee and their family members, mandatory health check-up of all employees and, a separate dedicated hospital for BEST staff.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/best-union-threatens-stir-asks-staff-to-stay-home-if-management-fails-to-enure-safety-amid-covid-19/story-HSS4b1xoPRIPSFZhmOv85H.html
14-05-2020||Mumbai||Public spat within BJP over legislative Council polls continues||Amid the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, public spat within the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over nomination of candidates to the Legislative Council has continued. After senior party leader Eknath Khadse’s allegations that the state leadership betrayed him and other Other Backward Class (OBC) leaders, which was followed by a rebuttal by party state unit chief Chandrakant Patil, another BJP leader, Ram Shinde, has expressed unhappiness about the way candidates were nominated.Shinde, former BJP minister and a ‘Dhangar’ or shepherd community leader, took to micro-blogging platform Twitter on Wednesday to taunt Patil and his former colleague Pankaja Munde. He tweeted, “In the backdrop of the legislative Council polls, BJP state chief Chandrakant Patil tweeted: Aspirants and leaders desiring legislative Council nomination will understand and learn. Pankaja Munde seems to have studied this quickly in two days (That’s why Ramesh Karad got nomination). Others and I could not manage it.”Shinde’s jibe was aimed at state BJP’s last minute decision to switch one of the four candidates wherein the party dropped Dr Ajit Gopchade and gave Karad, considered close to Munde, a ticket instead. The move has raised several eyebrows within the party. As opposed to Munde, Shinde is considered to be close to former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis. On Thursday, Shinde said, “I was keen on nomination to legislative Council, and as I have tweeted, I failed to study well while Munde managed to get a nomination for Karad.” He indicated that Munde used pressure tactics to get the ticket as she had earlier tweeted that she was learning to start from zero again, as a signal to party leadership.Munde did not comment on the issue.BJP state unit chief Chandrakant Patil has made it clear that the Central leadership was opposed to giving council poll tickets to anyone who had lost state Assembly polls. Both Munde and Shinde had lost in the Assembly polls held in October.Earlier, Khadse had slammed Fadnavis for side-lining OBC leaders like himself and stabbing him in the back. Patil had then retorted saying Khadse had forgotten the many opportunities that the party gave him, including chance to contest Assembly polls seven times, two term MP nomination to his daughter-in-law, an MLC nomination to his son earlier, nomination to his daughter to contest 2019 Assembly polls etc.Thackeray, 8 others declared elected unopposed, to take oath on MondayChief minister Uddhav Thackeray and eight others were announced as unopposed elected members of the legislative Council on Thursday. The nine members will take oath at Vidhan Bhavan on Monday. Besides Thackeray, Shiv Sena leader and deputy chairman of the legislative Council Neelam Gorhe; BJP’s Ramesh Karad, Gopichand Padalkar, Pravin Datke, Ranjitsinh Mohite Patil; NCP’s Shashikant Shinde and Amol Mitkari; and Congress’s Rajesh Rathod have been elected as members in 78-member upper house.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/public-spat-within-bjp-over-legislative-council-polls-continues/story-JLC0WUJO21nIncm3rVLPdP.html

14-05-2020||Gurugram||Confusion reigns as both MCG, developer hire sanitation staff for DLF areas||The residents of DLF 1, 2 and 3 have been wondering these days about who is really responsible for sanitation in their areas. The municipal corporation of Gurugram (MCG) and the area developer may not have an answer yet.On Monday, around 60 workers from a private firm hired by the MCG came for work at DLF Phase 1 but were allegedly turned away by the security guards in the area.According to DLF, they have outsourced the sanitation related works to a firm which has engaged over 200 workers for the three colonies.The three colonies have been in the process of being taken over by the MCG for maintenance since February 2016 On May 5 this year the MCG had awarded a contract to a private firm for undertaking sanitation work in the three colonies. However, as per DLF officials, they received no communication from the MCG on this matter and it was allegedly only when the workers were asked to go back on Monday that the MCG alerted the DLF regarding the matter.DLF officials said they are checking with the MCG on whether the private firm has been hired on a long-term basis for sanitation works or only temporarily to keep the areas clean in light of the coronavirus outbreak.“We received a letter from the MCG on May 11 from which we understood they too are engaging sanitation workers in DLF Phases 1, 2 and 3 to sanitise the area in a special drive to curb the spread of Covid-19. We had not not received any communication from the authorities related to taking over the three colonies before Monday, and are continuing our maintenance services as before,” said Shekhar Basu, director, DLF Estate.As per the MCG’s contract with the private firm, a copy of which is with the Hindustan Times, there is no mention of the time period for which the contract has been awarded. The contract mentions that a total of 268 workers are required to maintain sanitation operations and a monthly expenditure of around Rs 50 lakh is estimated for it.“The firm has been awarded the contract for a one-year period, after which, depending on their work, their performance will be reviewed and a decision on renewing the contract for another year will be taken,” said Bijendra Sharma, senior sanitary inspector.MCG officials, meanwhile, said that they decided to take over sanitation in the three colonies as they wanted to ensure the streets are clean, sanitised, and disinfected properly to prevent a Sars-Cov-2 outbreak here.After Monday’s communication, officials said the workers hired by the MCG returned to the localities and continued with their sanitisation works.RS Rathee, councillor of ward 34, said that the private firm hired by the MCG has initiated work in the three colonies as of Tuesday and the local resident welfare associations (RWA) of each colony are coordinating with them to get the work carried out.“The workers in the private firm hired by the MCG were unfamiliar with the surroundings. Hence I and the RWAs coordinated with them and explained to them the layout of each of the colonies. To control the Covid-19 pandemic, we want to ensure that all sanitation aspects are covered,” said Rathee.“There was confusion among residents regarding this development. Initially, the firm hired by the MCG had no clue about the areas. We subsequently briefed them and have been guiding them across the three colonies to ensure they are properly sanitised,” said Dhruv Bansal, official spokesperson of DLF Qutub Enclave RWA.As of now, both DLF and MCG are undertaking sanitation works in the three colonies, each with limited staff.In February 2016, Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar had announced that the three colonies, along with Sushant Lok 1 and Palam Vihar, would be taken over by the MCG.Subsequently, the developers of Sushant Lok 1 and Palam Vihar decided to pay the money required to fix civic deficiencies in their respective colonies while DLF decided to fix the deficiencies in their three colonies themselves before handing over.MCG took over Sushant Lok 1 and Palam Vihar in March last year.MCG’s deficiency assessment report in 2017 stated that ₹14.12 crore was required to fix civic deficiencies in DLF Phase 1, ₹9.43 crore for DLF Phase 2 and ₹11.89 crore for DLF Phase 3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-jurisdiction-for-maintenance-in-dlf-1-2-and-3-unclear-as-mcg-sends-sanitation-workers-without-communication/story-DCRQiHZ0A6U0C8CGPI5q5M.html

14-05-2020||City||Education department connects with students, parents for monitoring remote learning||Gurugram: The school education department of Gurugram is carrying out a survey to map the progress of students in government schools under the remote learning initiatives being run during the lockdown. As part of the monitoring process, the department has directed officers and workers at various levels to interact with students and parents and record their feedback.The education department said it has been sharing notes and assignments with students via WhatsApp for over a month now amid the nationwide lockdown imposed in March to contain the spread of the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease. Lessons are also being transmitted via the NCERT’s Swayamprabha channel and the three Haryana EDUSAT channels.As part of the survey, which began last week, different education officers starting from the school principal to block-level officers are required to reach out to different stakeholders and find out whether students are facing any hurdles in remote learning. All school principals are required to call a minimum of 20 students each daily and take feedback. Similarly, block education officers are required to record feedback from teachers, students and school heads over the same. Block resource persons have also been given lists of different students for the monitoring process. All officers are required to share the feedback recorded daily via email.Schools heads and principals have been asked to gather the progress made by students by seeking details from parents. A template of four questions has been shared by the department for the purpose, seeking details about the role of teachers in disseminating timetables, lessons and assignments. Further, parents are asked if they are providing adequate time and a supportive environment to the student for watching lessons being broadcasted. Lastly, students and parents are asked to share their grievances and inputs, if any.Ravinder Alawadhi, deputy director, SCERT, said the aim of the exercise us to familiarise students with remote learning while at home during the lockdown and monitor their progress, especially those students who do not have access to technology. According to a state government report, around 70% of government school students from classes 2 to 12 in the district have been connected via Whatsapp as part of the online learning campaign, leaving out a significant chunk of students.“Some students were not even aware that online studies are taking place during the lockdown. The message regarding remote classes could not be conveyed to them in the absence of public announcements. In order to fill the lacuna, the department decided to involve officers at different levels who have been asked to reach out to all stakeholders and apprise them about learning programmes being transmitted on TV,” said Alawadhi, who is overseeing the monitoring process in Gurugram, Faridabad, Nuh, Rewari, Palwal, and Mahendragarh.He added that details such as timetables of classes, transmission channels, and the program being telecast were being shared with students to help them participate. “From what we have gathered so far, more and more students are getting to know about remote learning since the past week. We have driven home the point that studies will happen remotely for now,” said Alawadhi.While the education department has not specified any closing date for the survey, Alwadhi said that it would be carried out till the percentage of students not accessing remote classes is covered up and all issues are resolved “There are certain communications gaps that we need to work on. Teachers and other officers are required to share a daily report but some teachers are still learning the ropes. The output and reporting need to be improved,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/education-department-connects-with-students-parents-for-monitoring-remote-learning/story-76v0qm0xwQ69CZpCttex4I.html
14-05-2020||Gurugram||Industry owners asked to fill up questionnaire regarding Covid-19 guidelines||The Haryana government is sending a 17-point questionnaire to the city-based industry owners to understand the status of operations and whether they are following the norms laid down by the ministry of home affairs(MHA) amid the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak. The owners have to fill up the questionnaire and submit it to the Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation (HSIIDC) within two days of receiving it.A team of three officials has been visiting the industrial units daily since Tuesday to get the questions answered. “Our team asks company to fill up the questionnaire in their presence and complete the formality instantly. If the company opts to submit it on the next day, our team hands them over the questionnaire. Our team has to cover the entire industrial zone in two days. The team has visited over 2,000 industrial units and we have received affidavits from 50 companies so far,” said Sunil Paliwal, estate manager, HSIIDC. The questionnaire includes points of concerns mentioned in the standard operating procedure (SOP) of the industry and commerce department, Haryana, released on April 19 for the resumption of industrial and commercial units.Information regarding mandatory installation of CCTV cameras, wearing of masks, daily sanitisation, on-floor marking of social distancing, number of employees who have joined the duty, number of employees for whom approval has been taken, the travelling details of the employees, thermal screening, use of tobacco products such as guthka etc, medical insurance details of the employees make up the questionnaire.“Our objective is to create a data bank of industrial units. The affidavit we are collecting from the industry owners will help us to assess the exact operational status of every industrial unit in the aftermath of the resumption order by the government,” said Paliwal.The Haryana government is also trying to figure out current condition of industries that have been badly hit by the lockdown.“We will be able to know how many employees/workers joined duties in their respective units. This will help us to assess the exact number of working employees and the absentees,” said Paliwal.There are around 10,000 industrial units in the district, engaging 12 lakh employees.Deepak Main, a Sector 37-based industry owner, said, “We welcome the initiative and are fully cooperating. Most of the industries have been granted permission by the government but labour shortage is a big problem. We are following Covid-19 guidelines. However, there is one thing that is missing in the questionnaire. The government should also ask us about the loss we had to face during the lockdown and plan relief accordingly.”This exercise of handing out a questionnaire to industry owners is a part of the mandatory inspection that is supposed to be carried out by the local authorities. The SOP of the industry and commerce department, Haryana government, states that the industrial units will be inspected by a team of government officials within five days of resumption of operations. The objective is to keep an eye on the employees and employers so as to ensure that the MHA guidelines are being followed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/industry-owners-asked-to-fill-up-questionnaire-regarding-covid-19-guidelines/story-LOpAfWwbeZQYqQpV1NyUdL.html
14-05-2020||City||Buses ferry migrant workers from border area of Morta in Ghaziabad||Thousands of migrant workers who arrived in the border area of Morta, Ghaziabad, looking for a way back to their home towns, were Thursday allowed to board a UP State Road Transport Corporation (UPSRTC) buses to their respective villages. Many living in shelter homes were also put on buses back to home. The mammoth gathering of workers, however, was uncontrollable and social distancing was largely flouted.The officials of UPSRTC said there was a need for about 155 buses to ferry all the migrant workers who arrived at Morta.“The buses are being sent on a regular basis. About 109 buses were dispatched on May 12 and more are being sent again on Thursday. We are trying to ensure that workers occupy only 30 of the 52 available seats on ordinary and Janrath buses. However, everyone wanted to board the buses. But officials at the spot tried hard to maintain social distancing,” AK Singh, regional manager of UPSRTC, said.He said separate arrangements were being made for migrant workers who were staying at shelter homes.“Each migrant who arrived in Morta on Thursday was properly screened by the health department and their identification noted down before they were allowed to board buses to different areas in eastern Uttar Pradesh and bordering areas of Bihar and Madhya Pradesh,” Singh said.As a result, majority of roads in Ghaziabad did not see the migrant worker exodus as seen over the previous days when groups had set out on foot with their families for the long trek back home.Twenty-five year-old Kavita, who is eight months pregnant, has been staying on the road with her family. However, when her family heard about buses from Morta, they rushed to the spot.“I going on eight months and have been staying on the road with my family. We are construction workers and our shanty near Raj Nagar was blown away by the squall three days ago. On Thursday, I heard that buses were going from Morta and so I arrived here with my husband and three-year-old son. We have no money left and need to return to our village in Damoh, Madhya Pradesh. The bus will drop us near the border and from there we will make further arrangements to reach home,” she said.“There is huge crowd and everyone is trying to get on the buses. My husband asked me to wait and not to move into the crowd as I could get hurt,” Kavita said.Most of the workers who arrived in Morta on Thursday were mostly from Delhi, Hayrana, Ghaziabad and Noida. “As soon as we heard that buses are leaving, we paid ₹500 per person and reached here by taxi from Gurugram on Wednesday night. However, there was a heavy rush and social distancing was hardly there. Everyone was trying to force their way onto buses and police could not control them. Still, we stood in long queues for our turn,” Dharmendra Kumar, who hails from Ghazipur in Uttar Pradesh, said. He used to work with a medical company in Manesar, Gurugram, and had arrived in Morta with 12 others.“We have tried our best to control the huge gathering of workers and accommodate them on buses to their home towns,” said Shailendra Singh, additional district magistrate (city), who was present in Morta to make the transport arrangements.“A number of trains are coming to UP from different states and the chief secretary has also written to Delhi to start four trains each day from Delhi to UP. It has also been decided that trains will also ply from Ghaziabad and Noida to areas in UP and Bihar. It is likely that the trains will start from Friday. The entire cost of the trains will be borne by the UP government and migrant workers will not be charged a fare,” Awanish Awasthi, additional chief secretary, Uttar Pradesh, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/buses-ferry-migrant-workers-from-border-area-of-morta-in-ghaziabad/story-A00i3FT1Koch9eaJqF9guL.html
14-05-2020||Gurugram||NGT stays non-forestry activities by CISF in Aravallis||The National Green Tribunal (NGT) on Thursday prevented the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) from carrying out any further non-forestry activities on 260 acres of forest land in Sohna’s Mandawar village. The CISF had, in October 2019, begun pre-construction activities in the area for setting up a paramilitary camp, leading to objections by the forest department. In response to a petition filed by Ram Avtar Yadav, the former sarpanch of the Manesar panchayat, the NGT had sought a report in the matter from the district forest officer (DFO), Gurugram. The report, submitted before the Tribunal in March, stated, “The CISF started works of site clearance and pruning of trees... without taking prior permission from the Divisional Forest Officer as mandated under general Section 4 of the Punjab Land Preservation Act, 1900.” The DFO’s report also states that the land is protected on at least two other counts, by virtue of the ministry of environment, forest and climate change’s (MoEFCC) Aravalli notification of 1992, and the Aravalli Plantation Project, both of which require clearances from the Central government (under the Forest Conservation Act, 1980) to allow non-forestry activities. “In view of above, it is necessary to ensure that no non-forest activity is allowed in the forest area without following the due process of law,” the NGT stated in its May 13 order.According to official documents, the Mandawar gram panchayat has sold at least 260 acres of protected Aravalli land to the CISF for setting up a paramilitary camp. A copy of the registry papers, dated September 22, 2019, are with Hindustan Times. They reveal that the land was sold at a cost of ₹104.29 crore, following a resolution passed by the panchayat on September 9. Jai Kumar, DFO, Gurugram, declined to comment on the matter. However, a senior forest department official directly overseeing the matter, said, “The NGT’s order is very clear. We had already registered a Forest Offence Report (FOR) against the user agency last year. We will not be allowing any further activities on site until permissions are obtained.” The transfer of land for development of public utilities has also sparked concern among environmentalists, who say the area forms a part of a wildlife corridor between Gurugram’s Damdama lake and Roz ka Gujjar (both leopard habitats), extending to Sariska in Rajasthan. Hemendra Singh, spokesperson, CISF, did not respond to calls and messages seeking comment on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/ngt-stays-non-forestry-activities-by-cisf-in-aravallis/story-3GgxmK46ZRyVhzCTRJqRsK.html
14-05-2020||Gurugram||First come, first served, says admin as migrants disallowed from boarding trains to Bihar||A group of 40-50 migrants, who had registered themselves on the e-Disha portal to return to their home towns in Bihar, were unable to board relief trains, after they were denied entry into the Tau Devi Lal Stadium, where they were asked to gather by the district administration through an SMS.  The workers who could not board the train on Thursday were allowed to enter the Tau Devi Lal Stadium at 5pm, given food and told by the administration that they would be sent to Bihar on Friday.Officials at the District Development Panchayat Office (DDPO), the nodal authority to register migrants’ details on the portal, said the facility is being run on a ‘first come, first served’ basis. They said that the train was able to accommodate only 1,200 people, against an expected 1,600, but assured that all those who have registered on the portal would be sent home.Railways officials denied that a train with lower-than-expected capacity was sent to the Gurugram railway station. “The train to Khagaria had a capacity of 1,600 passengers, but 1,200 had boarded the train as proper social distance was maintained,” said a senior Gurugram Railways official, on the condition of anonymity.Officials said that trains were sent to Bihar on Wednesday and Thursday, carrying 2,800 passengers in total, with another scheduled for departure on Friday. So far, around 100,000 migrants from Bihar have registered with the state government for returning to their home towns. Discussing the situation at the Tau Devi Lal Stadium on Thursday morning, district development panchayat officer Narender Sarwan said, “Entry was not given to those people who had come at 5am because the capacity of people who could be sent home had reached the maximum number. How can we take 2,000 people when the capacity of the train is 1,200? We will make sure that those who have been left behind will also go to their home towns.”Manoj Kumar, who had come to Gurugram in March in search of a livelihood, was spotted crying when he was not allowed to enter the stadium. “I came to the stadium at 5am, but I was not allowed to go inside it despite having received a message to board the train on Thursday,” said Kumar.After the doors of the stadium closed, the migrants took shelter on a non-motorised track near the Medanta underpass.Sajjan Kumar, who had accompanied Manoj Kumar, was also denied entry into the stadium. “I don’t have any place to go now. After I had received the SMS to come to Tau Devi Lal Stadium, I left the room in Bhim Nagar. Now, I don’t have any place to go,” said Sajjan Kumar.District administration officials said they check the credentials and body temperature of each person before they are allowed to board the train. The temperature of migrant workers is checked before they board the train, said a district administration official.Railway officials said that two trains left from Gurugram on Thursday — one to Khagaria in Bihar and the other to Maharaja Chhatrasal Station Chhatarpur in Madhya Pradesh.Sunil Sachdeva, the chief ticket inspector, said, “No fare was charged from the migrant workers who had boarded the train and everyone will get meals during the trip.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/first-come-first-served-says-admin-as-migrants-disallowed-from-boarding-trains-to-bihar/story-Brqs1qouWn4JjWFxuGnEiM.html

Senior medical officer Hans Raj said Harpal was a drug addict and was undergoing de-addiction treatment.Civil surgeon Harish Malhotra said, “He had been asymptomatic during his quarantine period. He was a drug addict and apparently died under a fit. That’s why doctors did not conduct Covid test on him.”However, SHO Jai Inder Singh Randhawa denied that the deceased was an addict and said the reason behind the death will be ascertained from the postmortem report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/nabha-man-dies-after-he-jumps-quarantine/story-t5OT2uIwJgzyjl4soFYfZP.html
14-05-2020||Mumbai||Are all high-risk contacts being screened in Mumbai’s slums?||Discrepancies in the screening of high-risk contacts of Covid-19 patients in some of Mumbai’s most congested areas have become a cause for concern, as they could lead to further spread of infection.At present, 10,237 high-risk contacts of Covid-19 patients have been quarantined at category-one Covid care centres (CCC-1) located in converted hotels, lodges, and schools. However, data from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has brought into question the efforts to screen vulnerable groups from wards like G/N and M/E which have some of the biggest slums in the city.As per the Union Health Ministry’s guidelines, people with comorbid health issues and those above the age of 60, who have come in direct contact with Covid-infected patients, are classified as high-risk contacts. BMC keeps them isolated in CCC-1 to prevent transmission of the virus.In Mumbai, there are 23,100 beds reserved for high-risk contacts in CCC-1 across the 24 wards. At present, only 55% of them are occupied with 10,237 people. In G/N ward, which comprises Dharavi, Dadar, and Mahim with 1,316 Covid-19 cases, has 1,590 beds under CCC-1 but only 412 high-risk patients are quarantined at these centres.Similarly, M/E ward, which includes areas like Govandi and Deonar, has quarantined only 432 high-risk patients while the bed capacity is 4,030 — the highest among the 24 wards. This is despite the ward having the most tuberculosis patients in the city.E (Nagpada) and F/N (Wadala, Sion Koliwada, Worli) wards, with the third and fifth-highest number of Covid cases, have kept only 378 and 356 high-risk contacts in their CCC-1 facilities, respectively. Wards like S (Bhandup, Vikhroli) and R/C (Borivli) on the other hand, which have recorded among the lowest number of cases, have institutionally quarantined the most high-risk contacts — 1,338 and 741, respectively. Health activists have criticised the screening process implemented by BMC. “As people with weak immunity or compromised lungs are most susceptible to Covid-19, it is important to isolate them immediately to break the chain of infection,” said Arun Kumar, from Apnalaya NGO.BMC said that high-risk contacts are screened as soon as someone tests positive for Covid-19. “Often, these high-risk contacts refuse to go to the centre and we have to take help from the police,” said Kiran Dighavkar, G/N ward officer.Predicting a surge in Covid cases by the end of May, BMC is trying to add more beds in CCC-1. “Just because 55% of the beds are vacant, doesn’t mean we aren’t isolating high-risk contacts.

They said while eight cases are from the Kashmir Valley, four are from the Jammu region.The officials said the total number of cases in Jammu and Kashmir has now reached 983.“Of these, 882 are in Kashmir, while 101 are in Jammu region,” they added.The officials said there are 487 active cases in the UT, 445 in Kashmir and 42 in Jammu, while 485 patients have recovered. The UT has witnessed 11 Covid-9 related deaths, nine in Kashmir and two in Jammu. Bandipore, Srinagar and Anantnag are the districts with maximum number of Covid-19 cases in J&K. The Officials attribute the surge in the number of positive cases to more and more testing and arrival of people from different states. A senior doctor, who is part of JK’s Covid-19 team, said that people shouldn’t get scared with this number. “Most of the fresh cases are contacts of already declared positive cases. Our recovery rate is good and death rate is also very low,” he added.He said majority of patients admitted in hospitals are showing mild symptoms of the disease. “Since we are testing more, so the cases have gone up. People should follow the guidelines to contain spread of Covid-19,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/coronavirus-lockdown-12-fresh-cases-take-j-k-tally-to-983/story-4M6ccSVnRtruuG2CHh1feN.html
14-05-2020||Noida||Society staff in Noida Sector 137 go on strike to demand salaries||The staff of a highrise in Sector 137 — Exotica Fresco — were forced to go on a strike for five days after they were not paid their salaries this month. The staff claimed that they had been promised double the pay if they worked during the lockdown, but ultimately not paid anything.Sources said that the housekeeping and maintenance staff and security guards of Exotica Fresco had been on a strike since Sunday, though most of them rejoined duty by Thursday after residents of the society requested them.“We were offered twice the salaries if we stayed here and worked during the lockdown. For the past 4 to 5 months, our salaries have been coming late and even though that is inconvenient, we somehow managed. But they haven’t paid us at all this month. We have responsibilities. I have to send money back home to Bihar. I also have family living in Noida who are dependent on my income,” said a security guard of the society, on condition of anonymity.He said that they have been assured of timely payment earlier, but not paid forcing them to go on a strikeOn Thursday, after much pleading and requests from residents, a section of the staff decided to partially resume their duties.“They do this every month and we have had enough. We would have continued the strike but some residents requested us to call it off. We have been told that we will get half our salaries soon. But if they had to pay only half, why did they offer us twice the money? If we don’t get our salaries soon, we may have to think about quitting altogether,” said a member of the housekeeping staff.The society normally retains more than 100 staff members but the number has been reduced to less than 35 amid the lockdown.“The reduced number of staff means that the existing ones have to put in more hours, without getting paid for it . We had to request them several times to get back to work, even though we absolutely understand their actions. Residents have tried to get in touch with their superiors, but there hasn’t been appropriate response and no one seems to be bothered by their plight,” said a resident of the society.“These people have been working on the front lines as the pandemic raged around us. Two days ago, I saw some of the staff members standing outside the gate with their families, because they desperately needed their wages. The problem is not that we had been left vulnerable because of lack of security or garbage collection. The problem is that these people are risking a lot and are not even being paid for their efforts,” said another resident.The society management, however, denied that the staff had gone on a strike.“There was some tension in the morning but all the staff returned to work promptly. There was a delay last month but the salaries were ultimately paid. And this month double salaries have to come, half of which will be paid by today (Thursday) and the rest by tomorrow ,” said Bhaskar Ojha, the estate manager of the society.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/society-staff-in-noida-sector-137-go-on-strike-to-demand-salaries/story-PcL3zik0ASP9cuEoN32ZwM.html
14-05-2020||Noida||After domestic helps, residents’ bodies want guidelines on movement of guests||With domestic air travel likely to resume soon and some special trains running operations already, local residents’ bodies are waiting for guidelines from the administration on what procedures to follow for guests that come to the district.While the district administration has allowed every resident welfare association (RWA) to take an independent call on the entry of domestic helpers inside the society’s premises with the consensus of the residents, officials are yet to specify norms on the movement of guests especially for those coming from outside the district and the state. “Movement of outsiders, except for those engaged in essential services, is completely barred in the society. A girl who was studying in Agra recently came back to her home here; such cases are fine and should be allowed to come back home, but we have asked all residents to not entertain any guests. In fact, we had a scare a few days ago when a flat owner in the area got his staff to stay here for self-quarantine without informing anyone from the RWA,” said Sanjeev Kumar, president, Sector 51 RWA said.Kumar said in such cases, clear guidelines will go a long way.“We have sanitisers and thermal screeners at the main gate of the sector and each guest is thoroughly screened. The movement of people in and out of the sector is very less right now, but with the relaxations in domestic travel, it may increase soon. We definitely need some guidelines on how to handle the movement of people in such a scenario. We have even raised the issue with senior officials during webinars,” said NP Singh, president, District Development Resident Welfare Association (DDRWA).In case of any kind of long-distance travel, officials have repeatedly advised people to go under self-quarantine for at least 14 days. They have also stressed on travelling only in case of emergency, while local travel is allowed only for essential purposes during the lockdown.“If it is some sort of a family health emergency and people are coming from outside, it is humane to let them return home. However, using a residential area for quarantine is not completely right. Ideally, people coming from outside should opt for institutional quarantine,” said chief executive officer of Greater Noida authority, Narendra Bhooshan, who is also the nodal officer for the district for efforts to control Covid-19 spread. Many residents’ bodies are requesting residents to notify them of any guests that they host in their homes.“Guests are not ideally allowed, and there are certain guidelines already in place for people travelling with necessary passes. Within the district, only people from non-containment zones are allowed to move around, and we request residents to inform us in advance if any outsider is going to stay with them. We also hope that as domestic travel picks up pace, we receive some guidelines from the administration,” said Rajiva Singh, president, Noida Federation of Apartment Owners Associations (NOFAA).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/after-domestic-helps-residents-bodies-want-guidelines-on-movement-of-guests/story-TmhaYuiq2zcSeQj3ASLnuK.html
14-05-2020||Gurugram||Realtors welcome govt decisions, seek increased liquidity and easier loans to tide over crisis||Developers in the city, who are struggling to resume construction of real estate projects, on Thursday, hailed the government’s decision to extend timelines for projects registered with the Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA). However, they said more measures are needed to kick-start the realty sector, which has been struggling for the last few years.The lockdown caused by the spread of the coronavirus disease, according to developers, will cause delays in the delivery of projects. They said that revenue has come to a standstill and are apprehensive about the possible cancellation of bookings done in the last six months.Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Wednesday said that states are being advised to invoke a force majeure clause of the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, so that registration and completion dates of these projects can be extended by six to nine months. The statutory compliances under RERA are also to be extended, she had said.In view of the multiple problems faced by the sector, realtors in Gurugram want the government to boost liquidity, ensure easier loan terms, extend the payment of dues on account of EDC/IDC by six to nine months and help in restructuring existing loans. At the national level, the industry said they want more sops and tax rebates for homebuyers, and reduction of home loan rates, so that demand for housing rises.Praveen Jain, the vice-chairman, National Real Estate Development Council (Naredco), said that extension of the deadline of projects for six months is a positive step but cautioned that the industry might spiral if more steps aren’t taken. “The industry is facing fund crunch and this needs to be addressed. We had requested a restructuring of loans and the addition of limits. Also, rescheduling of external development charge (EDC) dues needs to happen,” he said.Real estate industry body CREDAI expressed hope that measures for infusion of liquidity, decartelisation of cement prices and restoration of the supply chain to ease construction at project sites would be announced soon. “A majority of the construction labour wants to go home, while senior executives from Delhi, Faridabad and Noida are not allowed to come to work as borders are sealed. Unless more steps are taken, the labour present on sites will also vanish and we will be in a very bad situation,” said a developer, who preferred anonymity.Developers also called for augmentation of rental housing on a large-scale in metro cities of the country. “The government should come out with a comprehensive policy framework for rental housing. It will help in creating a large pool of rental housing, backed by financial institutions, with the help of an adequate policy framework,” said Pankaj Bansal, director, M3M Group.Despite the difficulties, the developers are optimistic that steps announced by the government, such as the extension of deadline and relief to employees under EPF, will boost sentiment and create a demand.“The buyers of the affordable category will benefit from government steps, as they will have extra money at their disposal. With extra disposable income, these beneficiaries will go for procuring real estate assets,” said Pradeep Aggarwal, chairman, Signature Global, which deals in affordable housing projects.“The Central government is announcing relief package for various industries right now. Once this is over, the state government will also come out with its own measures for the industries,” said Amit Arya, media advisor to the Haryana chief minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/realtors-welcome-govt-decisions-seek-increased-liquidity-and-easier-loans-to-tide-over-crisis/story-lhONzL8UJUsnYOsSJmLNOI.html
14-05-2020||Mumbai||Prithviraj Chavan suggests govt should borrow gold from religious trusts, faces flak||Former chief minister and senior Congress leader Prithviraj Chavan’s suggestion that the government should borrow gold lying with religious trusts in the country in the wake of financial crunch amid Covid-19 pandemic has stirred controversy as several organisations and temple trusts have strongly opposed the idea. Many blamed Chavan for targeting only Hindu trusts. Chavan had, on Wednesday, tweeted, “Government must immediately appropriate all the gold lying with all the religious trusts in the country, worth at least $1trillion, according to the #WorldGoldCouncil. The gold can be borrowed through gold bonds at a low-interest rate. This is an emergency.” He said that it can be borrowed at the interest rate of 1-2% in the form of a loan. However, some did not like the idea. Tushar Bhosale, joint convenor of Maharashtra BJP’s Spiritual Front, condemned Chavan for the concept coined by him. “If the Congress is so concerned about the financial condition of the country, it should first bring out the money usurped by the Congress leaders from scams during their rule,” he said. Chavan on Thursday said that his idea was not a new one and that the previous Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government had actually introduced the gold monetisation schemes. “The Vajpayee government in 1999 introduced the gold deposit scheme (GDS) as an aftermath of economic sanctions after May 1998 Pokharan Atomic tests. The scheme was targeted at individuals and institutions asking them to deposit gold in the banks. On November 5, 2015, PM Narendra Modi’s government modified the GDS and introduced the gold monetisation scheme which still exists. According to a finance ministry report, 20,547 kg of gold has been mobilised by 2,952 entities between November 2015 and January 2020 under the scheme. Two temples from Maharashtra have deposited their gold with 11 banks,” he said. Chavan said that both the schemes were introduced by BJP governments. Hindu Janjagruti Samiti, a right-wing organisation, alleged it is a deceptive appeal to usurp gold from temples. “The idea commensurates with the Congress’s anti-Hindu policies over the past 70 years. The party looted ₹4.82 lakh crore in the form of scams. Congress leaders should return the public money. The churches in the country own most of the land after the defence and railway ministries. Wakf Board owns nearly 7 lakh acres of land. Will the Congress leaders demand to take over their lands,” Ramesh Shinde, national spokesperson of Samiti said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/chavan-suggests-govt-should-borrow-gold-from-religious-trusts-faces-flak/story-1DBVRv3guaALQGtlw53seO.html
14-05-2020||Gurugram||Health teams to conduct additional 200 tests every week for community surveillance||The Gurugram health department is likely to soon start a systematic community surveillance in order to monitor the spread of Covid-19 at the district level.The monitoring, officials said, will include testing outpatient attendees in identified health facilities and pregnant women for the virus. Every week, 200 samples will be collected in addition to the routine testing done in containment zones and individual cases being reported from different areas of the city. “It is called district level facility-based surveillance for Covid-19. We will be selecting six public and four private healthcare facilities for community surveillance, as per government guidelines,” said Dr Jaswant Singh Punia, chief medical officer. He said that the health facilities will be identified by Friday after which testing will start. As part of the surveillance, the health team will be covering both low and high-risk population groups. In the low-risk group, outpatient attendees, especially those without Influenza like Illness (ILI), and pregnant women will be covered. In the high-risk category, samples of health care workers and hospital staff will be taken.Every week, 100 samples of health care workers will be collected, while 50 samples each of outpatient attendees and pregnant women will be taken adding up to 200 samples. “Every month at least 800 samples will be taken to check the spread of the infection,” said Punia.Nasal and throat swabs will be collected for RT-PCR and blood samples will be collected for ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) for IgG antibodies. As per an order issued by the state health department, the IgG ELISA based testing to detect if a person has antibodies will replace RT-PCR based testing in subsequent rounds for surveillance purpose. Also, pool testing of samples will be done only for surveillance but not for the diagnosis of individual patients. Rajeev Arora, additional chief secretary, health department, said,“The Central government has shared its guidelines for community surveillance. But Haryana has already been doing random testing to check spread of the infection. We will now be merging the state and the Central government guidelines and increase the surveillance base.”Dr Preeti Kumar, vice president, Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI), said that community surveillance would aid in identifying areas where cases are high. “Mass testing of population is impossible due to operational issues and other technical factors. Sampling becomes extremely critical by doing proper size estimation. Separate containment strategies can be framed for areas with high number of cases while freeing others from lockdown restrictions.”According to her, testing pregnant women becomes essential as they cannot be denied healthcare services, while those visiting OPDs having no ILI -like symptoms can be silent carriers. “During an epidemic, surveillance and sampling require extra vigilance,” said Kumar. TESTING IN URBAN SLUMSContinuing with its targeted sampling, the district health team is now focusing on urban slums. Surveillance and sample collection exercise was done in urban slums of the city such as Chakkarpur, Tigra and Ghata. In Chakkarpur, 252 people were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using Rapid Testing Kits (RTK) while 40 samples were taken for RT-PCR test. All the tests turned out to be negative. Likewise, in slums of Tigra, 90 people were tested for antibodies and 60 for RT-PCR. In Ghata, 29 were tested for antibodies and 46 for RT-PCR. Punia said that the exercise in these areas will continue till Sunday. At least 128 samples were also taken from Khandsa Mandi, wholesale market for fruits and vegetable, where 25 vendors have tested positive so far.According to the data shared by the state health department, 441 RT-PCR test and 341 antibody test have been done in the urban slums of the district, that house a population of more than 1 million . Out of which 2,56,866 households have been surveyed by ASHA workers since the beginning of the outbreak and 9,35,372 were screened for ILI and Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI). Data shows, 2992 people were found with ILI, breathlessness, pneumonia and SARI. None of them were found to be Covid-19 positive. While in other districts, like Jhajjar, 72 people in urban slums were tested Covid-19 positive. 16 were found positive in Faridabad, 14 in Panipat and 4 in Sonepat slums.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/health-teams-to-conduct-additional-200-tests-every-week-for-community-surveillance/story-FBAiPx9vNaGMMl5nDb5thL.html

They have to go to containment areas, visit each house and find out if anyone has any symptoms. Highlighting the health concerns, they have demanded a health insurance like those for health workers.“We are not even sure how many days it will take to complete the survey.

Although we are maintaining a safe distance during the survey, we are worried about our health,” said Gulabrao Patil, teacher at a KDMC school, who has been surveying houses for 15 days.The teachers have written to the KDMC.“We need proper safety gear, masks and gloves. A health insurance is a must as we are risking our lives. We conduct a health survey and tell residents about precautionary measures,” said Jitendra Singh Nikumbh, a teacher at KDMC school in Kalyan.KDMC said it will take time to consider the teachers’ demand.“The letter given by the teachers is with the health department and they will have to discuss with authorities before taking a decision.

14-05-2020||City||Chaos outside Bathinda rly station as 3,000 turn up to board Shramik Express||Amid allegations of police lathi-charge by migrant workers going back home and utter chaos, around 3,000 of them left the district, in a Shramik Express train to Bihar and in 26 private buses to Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh, on Thursday.The chaos resulted as workers in huge numbers, more than the train’s capacity, turned up at the railway ground, the designated collection point. This was the third Shramik Express from the city, and was to go to Motihari in Bihar without stopping, but workers from other states had also crowded the area around the railway station. Finally, 1,521 migrant workers left on this train.The indications for chaos were there on Wednesday itself, when a large crowd had gathered outside the railway ground, before the administration finally managed to send them to the DAV College and the Government Polytechnic College to spend the night. Even as they were taken to the railway station on Thursday morning, more workers had arrived from other parts of the city. Akhilesh Kumar of Purnea in Bihar, who worked as painter in Bathinda, said, “The police lathi-charged us. I was injured in the leg.” Ankit Kumar, from Gopalganj in Bihar, who missed the train in the chaos, also claimed police lathi-charge.Bathinda SSP Nanak Singh, however, said, “No force was used on workers. They had arrived in numbers that were more than the train’s capacity, so some were sent back.” With workers from Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand left behind, they were sent back in 26 private buses. Bathinda deputy commissioner B Srinivasan said, “Workers arranged these buses themselves and paid for travel. We only issued them travel passes.” The worker Ankit claimed that workers were so desperate to go home that they paid Rs 2,000 each for the bus up to Bihar border and Rs 1,200 each to be dropped at the Uttar Pradesh border. 100th Shramik Express leaves state The 100th Shramik Express from the state, the 39th from Ludhiana since the first train chugged out from Jalandhar on May 5, left the state on Thursday.

This was the first time she participated in the Jamaat,” said her husband Mohammad Rafi. They all left for their native place in Guntur.The woman Rizwana and nine others were arrested on April 3 from Lucknow and put in a quarantine centre, besides being booked for lockdown violation.On May 3, they were shifted to a temporary jail in Shri Ram Swaroop College here. “Since she was pregnant, I asked authorities as to when we would be released.

The crops in this region are harvested on the cost of natural resources that leads to groundwater depletion and deterioration in soil and environmental quality, the scientists said. They have also advised the farmers to adopt root zone irrigation (RZI) over flood irrigation to save the groundwater. The research has suggested that RZI not only saves about 50% water, but also improves yields up to 20% by eliminating surface water evaporation with similar management practices over flood irrigation.OVER 3FT DECLINE IN GROUNDWATER EVERY YEAR The report also reveals that the decline of about 3-feet every year in the groundwater table between 1973 and 2001 has accelerated by five-fold between 2000 and 2006 in central Punjab and parts of Haryana. Moreover, during 2008-2012, the total freshwater withdrawals in India were about 761 billion cubic metre of which about 90% was used for agriculture. By 2050, the share of water for agricultural use will be less than 50% of the total water from the present share of 70%, the report read.‘MAIZE A GOOD ALTERNATIVE’Director of ICAR-CSSRI, Karnal, PC Sharma, said, “There is an immediate need to break the wheat-paddy cycle to save groundwater for the future generations.” He said that maize could be a better option for both wheat and paddy as it consumes 50% less water, but there is a need of assured marketing of maize such as wheat and paddy to divert farmers. “Both rice and wheat need 20% less nitrogen-based fertilisers under a subsurface drip fertigation (injection of fertilisers) system. It can improve ecosystem’s health and cut the emission of greenhouse gases,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/breaking-wheat-paddy-cycle-a-must-to-save-groundwater-cssri-study/story-Dw2Zperrefw8WecQkrEriM.html
14-05-2020||Lucknow||‘Stop Qaiserbagh from becoming a Dharavi’||‘Stop Qaiserbagh from becoming a Dharavi,’ said corporator Sayyed Yawar Hussain Reshu of JC Bose ward (in which a part of Qaiserbagh falls). He said, “As many as 20 covid positive cases have been reported in Qaiserbagh sabzi mandi area in last five days because no one was able to stop the residents from gathering at the places inside and around the mandi. We require a bit of strictness from the administration and police and we are ready to help them in every way. The chain of corona spread has to be broken or else people living in ghettos would be severely affected.”My only concern is that no one is taking the help of corporators in planning the strategies to counter the spread, corporators could be handy in giving the minutest details about their area, as they are in touch with everyone, said Sayyed Yawar Hussain Reshu. He said that there is a need to persuade the residents to come out and get tested if they acknowledge any symptom for coronavirus. The corporators could also be of help in the distribution of essential commodities and food supplied by community kitchens to the poor residents, said Reshu.Corporator of Nayagaon and part of Qaiserbagh Shafeeq Ur Rehman Chacha said, “I am always ready to help the authorities and reach out to the suspected residents. The area is densely populated and we require aggressive testing. I am happy that the administration has done it now but still, they need to reach out to more residents.”However, municipal commissioner Indramani Tripathi said, “We are taking the help of corporators in the distribution of food and food items to the poor; we are also gathering information about the number of people residing in the locality and those violating the lockdown and keep roaming on the streets. We are also using them for motivating the residents for coming out for test as it is for their benefit only.”District magistrate Abhishek Prakash said, “We have tested more than 400 people from the area and are in process of testing more. District administration along with police is working in coordination to identify, test and quarantine the suspects in the hotspots.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/stop-qaiserbagh-from-becoming-a-dharavi/story-Lm7u0Oo4M1VVIBbqFQ1t8J.html

We were shocked when we were asked to be put in paid quarantine at hotels on landing in our own country,” said Parminder Singh, who was among 178 Punjabis evacuated from United Arab Emirates (UAE) by a special Air India flight from Dubai on Wednesday.After they refused to stay at hotels, all the evacuees, including children and women, had to spend nearly the entire night inside the terminal of Sri Guru Ram Das Jee International Airport here under police watch.The flight arrived at the airport at around 9.15 pm on Wednesday and the evacuees were forced to remain there till 4 am on Thursday. Later, 38 of them belonging to Amritsar were finally put in quarantine at Swami Vivekanand Drug De-Addiction and Rehabilitation Centre while the others were sent to their respective districts.“As we landed at the airport, the government staff gave a proforma to each of us to fill. For 14-day quarantine period, there were options of five various hotels, with charges ranging from Rs 1,000 to Rs 3,800 per head per day,” he said.“None of us had money to pay for hotel charges for 14 days. We did not have money to purchase even our ticket to return through special flights and some NGOs paid for us”, said Parminder, who belongs to the city and was staying at Dubai on work permit.“We had to stay in a closed terminal from 9.15 pm to around 4 am, which was no less than a nightmare for us,” said Harjit Kaur, who also belongs to Amritsar.In some videos shot by the passengers at the airport with their smart phones, chaos like situation prevailed inside, with norms of social distancing given a go by and parents seen purchasing costly milk for their kids.Additional deputy commissioner (ADC) Himanshu Aggarwal, said, “We had made quarantine arrangements in hotels as the Indians evacuated from other countries recently protested against being quarantined in government centres.”Denying chaos at the airport, he added, “For passengers’ facilitation, many of our officers spent hours at the airport to manage the things.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/short-of-money-punjabis-evacuated-from-dubai-refuse-to-be-put-in-paid-quarantine/story-nkVDcj9D1YRixVxCMNjY1O.html

Now, the university has directed the departments and affiliated colleges to submit the internal assessments of undergraduate (UG) and postgraduate (PG) students and also the external practical award of final semesters of 2019-20 academic session online .A notice issued by the university’s controller of examinations read, “Teaching departments and affiliated colleges are requested to submit both the theory practical and internal assessment awards online on PU website.”Through the notice, it has been further clarified that only external practical awards of final semesters of UG and PG courses need to be submitted. Also, the affiliated colleges have been directed not to send hard copy of students’ internal assessments.Moreover, PU has informed that its website will be open for the submission of internal assessments for all semesters of UG and PG courses from June 17 to June 26. But the external practical awards of the final semesters can be submitted till July 2.However, PU senator Dalip Kumar said that the university should prepare practical award guidelines in order to facilitate timely completion of the task. “Norms for the conduct of practicals are to be defined. Besides, timeline and checklist should be prepared by the university in a comprehensive way,” Kumar added.An assistant professor at Sri Guru Gobind Singh College, Sector 26, Inderpal Singh Sidhu, who is also a PU senator, said, “There is a confusion that needs to be sorted as practicals were not completed in the colleges due to the lockdown.” “Now that the practical exams have also not been conducted, we need some mechanism to prepare a list of practical awards of students,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/panjab-university-seeks-internal-assessment-of-students-online/story-r4CLL5t6XJWkOHFTl0oWrO.html
14-05-2020||City||Unable to book train tickets, migrants start out on the arduous journey home on foot||New Delhi:Until Tuesday, 26-year-old Lala Ram Kewat lived at the construction site he worked at. With more than 50 days without a job and his paltry savings dwindling day-by-day, Kewat is now walking 463 kilometres to his village in Jhansi, Uttar Pradesh from his home Delhi’s Inderlok with his wife, two children and some friends.Behind him is a group of young men walking to Bihar’s Katihar. They offer to carry his seven-year-old, who is tired of walking. All these days, since the lockdown began, the young men, all of whom work as labourers, were staying at an under-construction site and were dependent on assistance from the local police for food.Abu Kalan, 19, the youngest in the group, says they could not arrange a train ticket to go home. “We don’t even have an internet-enabled phone. On Wednesday, eight of us walked to the New Delhi railway station to see if we could buy a ticket from the counter but the police refused to let us inside as we did not have valid e-tickets. We cannot live in Delhi anymore without a job,” he said.Starting Tuesday, the government began eight special trains, including three from Delhi, as a step towards restoration of passenger train services in a graded manner. The government had also started special Shramik trains to send stranded migrant workers back home. At least five Shramik trains have left for Madhya Pradesh and Bihar from the national Capital. But to avail of this service too, the passengers must apply online or through the district magistrate’s office for a seat. Government officials helped migrants who were staying in shelter homes but a majority of the migrant workers, however, were staying on their own at their workplaces such as construction sites, among others, who were not able to avail of direct help.Unable to register for Shramik trains or buy tickets online, migrant workers from across the city are starting out on foot back to their villages every night. The booking counters at railway stations are currently shut, which has rendered workers such as Kalan and Kewat helpless in getting a ticket.To avoid heat during the sunlight hours, the workers are covering the distance at night. They spend their days in parks near state highways trying to arrange food from good Samaritans or NGOs. The day is also the time they search for water -- each of them carries at least two bottles.On Thursday, the day temperature was 40 degrees Celsius in the national Capital while the minimum temperature the previous night was 24 degrees Celsius.“It is better to walk at night. It is difficult to walk with children during the day; they will faint. We stayed at the Jasola DDA district park today. The guard was kind enough to allow us to use the bathroom. He understood that we are travelling with our families. The trees in the park provided us with cover from the sun. It will take me at least five nights to reach Jhansi. We will start our journey again in the evening,” Kewat said.According to government officials, only 20% of migrant workers are now housed in state-run shelter homes and school premises. Apart from the government’s 223 shelters for the homeless, 256 school buildings were opened as shelter homes for tens of thousands of migrant workers who were stuck in Delhi.Bipin Rai, member, Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB), which is the nodal agency for arranging shelter for the homeless in the city, said that only about a fifth of the stranded migrants are now remaining at the shelters.“We have been appealing to them to stay back and return to work, as some sectors are opening up. Many have stayed back. Others living in rented rooms or shanties feel they have run out of money and won’t be able to survive longer. Also, there is a belief among most of them that the coronavirus (Covid-19) is an urban disease and that they will be safer in their villages, which they feel have so far not been infected by the virus,” said Rai.Sunil Aledia, a social activist who works for the homeless, said that most migrant workers leaving the city are those who live with their families. “They do not have money left to sustain themselves anymore. The NGOs give them food and rations but they don’t even have gas cylinders or utensils now. The government must find jobs for them if it does not want these thousands of migrant workers to leave.”As migrant workers continue to leave Delhi on foot, they say they have hope across the border. It took Kalan and his friends seven hours to walk the 39 km distance from Nangloi to Badarpur (Delhi’s border with Haryana) on Wednesday night.“Some of our friends found a taxi in Faridabad to cross Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. We hope we also find one. We may die walking to Bihar but we don’t have a choice,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/unable-to-book-train-tickets-migrants-start-out-on-the-arduous-journey-home-on-foot/story-PITPlbCfzJNqmDwCpanfeO.html

Of them, 1,225 pilgrims were found positive. However, almost all of them have remained asymptomatic. There were only mild symptoms of flu in a few positive cases found symptomatic, said health department functionaries.‘WILL FOLLOW 7-DAY HOME QUARANTINE’“Once discharged, the positive cases will be asked to strictly follow seven-day home quarantine as per the guidelines of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR),” Dr Bhaskar said.The discharge of pilgrims from hospitals will bring a sharp decline in the number of active cases in the state as out of 1,980 positive cases in Punjab so far, more than 60% were Nanded-returnees.In the past two days, 52 positive cases were discharged from various districts, taking the total tally of cured patients to 223.As per the protocol followed by the health department, the pilgrims were kept at institutional quarantine facilities and tests were done on all of them.Those who tested positive were sent to government hospital isolation wards, whereas those found negative were kept in quarantine facilities for 14 days. In negative cases, re-testing is done if any one develops symptoms.The health authorities have already sent pilgrims lodged in quarantine facilities to their homes as none of them developed any symptom in four-day period. These pilgrims will also follow seven-day home quarantine.The Covid-19 infection among a large number of Nanded-returnees had given rise to a major controversy in Punjab, with opposition parties accusing the state government of not following proper procedures in bringing the pilgrims back.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/most-of-covid-19-positive-nanded-returnees-to-be-discharged-in-2-days/story-Pa4MCIp8X0Esg4eMUZRODO.html

The school heads will only decide if the students have to called class-wise or subject-wise as depending on the strength of the school. Principals will ensure that there is no crowding and that proper social distancing norms are followed.” As of now the books have been supplied to Kharar that covers Mohali and Majri as well. However, not all books are available and supplies are dependent on the availability of books.“In order to ensure that there is no loss of studies, lessons are being shared online and through Whatsapp among the students. In some cases, the books of the outgoing students were also shared with the new students as a stopgap arrangement,” said DEO (secondary) Himmat Singh.However, a government school principal in Mohali requesting anonymity said that the school had not received any official information regarding distribution of books so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-education-department-gears-up-for-distribution-of-books-at-homes-in-mohali/story-JNVnX044UPCtjwuw3Ql6KM.html

This meant the “infection rate” among the migrant workers was close to 5%,” said Bihar health secretary Lokesh Kumar Singh.A total of 2.36% of the 40,782 Covid-19 samples tested were positive for Sars-CoV-2 till Thursday noon. Till recently, the same figure was 1.7% - 1.8%, said Singh. This meant that the “infection rate” among migrants was more than double the state’s average, leading to a spike in cases during lockdown 3.0.Of the 352 migrants who tested positive recently, 97 had come from Gujarat, 66 from Maharashtra, 22 from West Bengal, 17 from Haryana and 13 from Uttar Pradesh, he added. Besides, some had returned from other states, including Jharkhand, Telangana and Kerala.Singh, however, did not respond to this reporter’s query on Bihar’s Covid-19 testing rate per million population.Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar has already asked health officials to ramp up testing facilities for Covid-19 in the state.Bihar has only six approved government testing laboratories, of which four are in Patna and one each at the medical colleges of Muzaffarpur and Bhagalpur. The laboratory at the Jawahhar Lal Nehru Medical College Hospital, Bhagalpur, which commenced testing on May 3, has temporarily stopped Covid-19 testing because of shortage of cartridges. The laboratory had conducted 350 tests before it ran out of cartridges.“The chief minister wants testing of Covid-19 samples to be increased to at least 10,000 samples (in a day) as against 1,900-2,000 tests being done as of now. He wants the laboratory testing facility to be extended even to districts, and at the same time also ensure that there was no shortage of equipment and drugs across the state,” said Anupam Kumar, secretary of Bihar’s Information and Public Relations Department.Meanwhile, 25 Covid-19 patients were cured and discharged from different facilities during the last 24 hours, taking the total number of recoveries in the state to 411 so far. Seven people infected by the virus had died so far.Nine cases were reported from Purnea, six from Lakhisarai, five from Jehanabad, four from Khagaria, three each from Muzaffarpur, Banka, Nalanda, two from Sheikhpura, Rohtas, Vaishali , Supual, Khagaria and one each from Nawada, Bhojpur and Kishanganj on Thursday.Around 130 people had reported positive on May 12 in what was the biggest single-day spike in cases since March 22, when Bihar reported the first three cases of the fast spreading contagion.As of Thursday, Munger reported 122 cases, followed by Patna (99), Rohtas (77), Nalanda (66), Buxar (59), Begusarai (47), Siwan (38), Kaimur (33), Madhubani (31), Bhagalpur (32), Khagaria (36), Bhojpur (29), Jehanabad (26), West Champran, Nawada (25 each), Gopalganj (24), Aurangabad (18), Darbhanga, Muzaffarpur (16 each), East Champaran (15 each), Purnea (13), Banka (14), Katihar, Arwal, Lakhisarai (12 each), Samastipur, Sheikhpura (11 each), Saran, Saharsa, Kishanganj (10 each), Madhepura, Supaul (9 each), Gaya (8), Sitamarhi (7), Vaishali (6), Araria (4), Sheohar (3) and Jamui (1) till the time of going to the press.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/46-more-test-covid-positive-in-bihar-tally-rises-to-999/story-Cr99LI3NHkK69JlOQowxcN.html

The workers had decided to pedal all the way to their native place after being forced by circumstances amid the coronavirus lockdown.They alleged that their factory owners did not pay them their wages for March and since then, they were staying in shelter homes.After covering nearly 425 kilometres with swollen feet, one of the migrant labourers, Saurabh, said they started their journey on March 9 after Punjab government did not list their names among those who left for UP in buses.“We don’t have enough money to hire taxis for going home. We are tired, but the thought of returning home encourages us to pedal more, even in the humid weather. We are hopeful that we will reach our homes in the next three days,” he said.LOCALS PROVIDING FOODThe worker also hailed the locals, saying, “Residents of Haryana and Punjab are so kind-hearted that they provided us food, milk, water bottles and clothes to cover our faces throughout the way.”Another worker, Neeraj Kumar, alleged that the police were creating hurdles in their way. “The police personnel have been asking us to stay in shelter homes. Everyday, our 1-2 hours get wasted in convincing them to let us move ahead,” he said. “Moreover, the governments are working for rich people only. As we didn’t have work for the past 45 days, it is better to spend time with the family rather than remaining stranded in camps,” the migrant worker said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/miles-to-go-six-migrant-workers-pedalling-their-way-to-up-on-three-bicycles/story-bMY4qSziDWaMVfbBNWF2QJ.html
14-05-2020||Chandigarh||THREAT CHARGE- Channi, Tript Bajwa lock horns, accuse each other of lying||Punjab cabinet ministers Charanjit Singh Channi and Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa locked horns on Thursday over the latter’s threat to him after the showdown with chief secretary Karan Avtar Singh.Channi accused his cabinet colleague of lying about the threat he issued whereas Bajwa continued to deny that any such incident took place. Both ministers said they have left it to chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh and Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar to decide the matter even as some Dalit legislators of the party rallied in Channi’s support.The spat between the two ministers, which has exposed the sharp divide in the state council of ministers, is yet another twist in the raging controversy over the state’s excise policy in the Punjab government. Punjab Congress chief Sunil Jakhar said the situation was unfortunate. “Coming after the incident involving the chief secretary, this was totally avoidable. I first had a word with Channi and then phoned Bajwa who I have asked to brief me. Whatever misunderstanding has happened between the two ministers, the party will resolve it,” he said.Bhoa legislator Joginder Pal was the first to talk about the alleged threat on Wednesday, stating that Bajwa threatened Channi with reopening of some old cases if he did not bury the hatchet with the chief secretary. Coming out in the open, Channi, while confirming the MLA’s claim, accused the rural development minister of threatening him with registration of a case. “He talked about registration of case. I told him you get the case registered first because I am not going buckle down under any pressure,” Channi told a television channel, accusing his ministerial colleague of lying.Channi, a Dalit leader, said he had received support from (AAP state unit president) Bhagwant Mann, some Akalis and a number of MLAs and other leaders of Congress who phoned him to express their support. The technical education minister said he spoke to the chief minister and the state Congress president and told them about the threat. “I have left it to them to decide what to do about it,” he said.Bajwa, on the other hand, flatly denied the charge, stating he had not threatened Channi. “I was with (finance minister) Manpreet Badal and Channi on the standoff with the chief secretary. I am still standing with them. The whole is being blown out of proportions. The chief minister and Jakhar can call us both and find out the truth,” the rural development minister said. He said the Bhoa MLA’s statement was part of local politics of their region. The two episodes where charges are being levelled and pressure tactics used by the Congress ministers and leaders on social media and television have left the party leadership red-faced besides giving ammunition to the opposition parties against the state government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/threat-charge-channi-tript-bajwa-lock-horns-accuse-each-other-of-lying/story-F1mdTI0bQkQAavPmHRR9gN.html

The data collection started a few weeks back as a part of the state government’s plan of skill mapping to provide suitable employment to the migrants who returned home amid lockdown following Covid outbreak.“We have prepared a data base of 77,000 workers by categorising them sector and block wise and taking their personal details like phone number and home address etc,” said industry minister Shyam Rajak. He said the data base will also have details of where they worked previously, the number of years spent in the factory and area of specialization.A large number of labourers who returned to the state were working in Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka, Punjab , Delhi and Harayana . “The migrants profiled are experienced in multiple fields, including automobile, textile, plastic , laying floor tiles, brick soling and machinery. A good number of them are carpenters while others have worked in steel units. The number of workers profiled will increase in the next few days as the data collection is going on,” Rajak said.Meanwhile, the industry minister and industry department officers Friday will interact with all the district magistrates (DMs) to discuss avenues of job creation at local level. An official said the industry department has started working with the business bodies to encourage them to employ the migrant workers based on their skills so that employment is generated.Meanwhile, the state government has already increased the work hours in factories from 8 to 12 hours for next three months to enhance productivity, boost commercial activity following the contraction in the economy in the lockdown period. There are indications that the state government would further amend labour laws for giving more investors more incentives to set up industry in the state, as like other states like Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.Previously, Bihar chief minister (CM) Nitish Kumar had laid stressed on skill mapping in various districts as a way for providing employment to migrant workers who returned home in last few weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/job-generation-industry-dept-profiles-77-000-migrant-workers-so-far/story-USYRglrybKcYFm6JWyfVfP.html

Kotkpura MLA Kultar Singh Sandhwan and several other party leaders were also present.Referring to ongoing spat between the ministers and bureaucrats, he stressed the need for a state-run liquor corporation in Punjab in tune with those set up by the Delhi and Tamil Nadu governments for better management and increase in excise revenue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/amarinder-responsible-for-sorry-state-of-affairs-aap/story-91maaUR4DXbmaxBdo7hQtL.html
14-05-2020||Patna||Bihar tweaks discharge policy, makes one –ve follow up test must||The state government Thursday tweaked the discharge policy for Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) infected patients on cure, by mandating one negative follow up result in the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test before releasing all types of patients enrolled at the medical facilities for treatment.“The negative follow-up result is a must in all pre-symptomatic and symptomatic cases of Covid infection,” said principal secretary, health, Sanjay Kumar, adding that a notification to this effect was issued on Thursday.He said that the state’s discharge policy for Covid patients was more stringent than that of the Union ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW). “They recommend the discharge after a few days without negative RT-PCR test, while the revised policy of the state recommends for one negative RT-PCR test,” he said.Earlier, pre-symptomatic and mild symptomatic patients were discharged from the Covid facility after 10-days of symptom onset and no fever in the last three days. Cases with moderate symptoms were also released if the patients’ fever resolved within three days and they maintained oxygen saturation about 95% for next four days without an oxygen support. A negative RT-PCR test was mandatory in severe cases.The amended policy, which has been sent to all the heads of all medical colleges and hospitals along with the administrative bosses of all the districts, is deemed to come into effect immediately. Officials said that additional negative test on positive patients before there release might have its added bearing on the existing resources for clinical testing.The change in release policy assumes considerable significance in view of the recent spike in Covid cases, following the return of migrants from different parts of the country and chief minister (CM) Nitish Kumar’s insistence to go for rigorous testing of suspected cases.Officials said that the CM had recently directed the health department officials to ensure clinical testing of around 10,000 persons daily compared to the previous 1,800-2,000 RT-PCR testing. Kumar, during his recent video-conferencing with PM Modi had asked for more testing kits urgently.The number of Covid positive cases had reached 966 (till the filing of this report) on Thursday from just 66 on April 14, in the state. Samples of 42,000 persons were clinically examined for Covid at six out of seven facilities of the state government. Testing at Bhagalpur-based government medical college and hospital has been discontinued due to lack of facilities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/bihar-tweaks-discharge-policy-makes-one-ve-follow-up-test-must/story-cwxhjYV5g6Mysq1wy4PZHI.html

14-05-2020||Chandigarh||Two-third Punjab liquor vends stay shut, GoM meets contractors today||Nearly 65% of a total of 5,800 liquor vends in Punjab remained closed on Thursday, a day after chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh announced a relief of ₹760 crore to the contractors for the losses incurred by them during the 45 days of the lockdown period (from March 23 to May 6). A meeting between the liquor contractors and a group of ministers comprising Manpreet Singh Badal (finance), Vijay Inder Singla (education) and Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria (housing and urban development) will be held on Friday to look into the issue. As per reports, the sale of liquor was negligible in various districts. While most vends remained shut in Patiala and south Malwa on Thursday, some traders opened their shops in Sangrur and Jalandhar for a while. In Amritsar, a few vends were open but had no buyers. Of the 350 vends in Bathinda district, only nine opened. Ferozepur deputy excise and taxation commissioner HPS Gotra said all 132 vends of 11 groups remained open. In Ludhiana, liquor contractors kept their vends closed. The district has 750 vends. A delegation of contractors held a meeting with deputy excise and taxation commissioner Pawan Garg and announced to open the vends from Friday.CONTRACTORS’ GROUSEThe vend owners say actual losses are more than that of 45 days and the government should rework the annual quota. The state government had allowed opening of vends from May 7 after having imposed curfew on March 23. Of the 686 groups Punjab is divided for sale of liquor, the government was unable to sell 14% of them due to the lockdown. Deep Malhotra, who has major stakes in liquor business in the Malwa belt said, “Quota should be fixed for the first quarter of the year which could be reviewed later on depending on the situation. Vends are not opening because traders want clarity on all the issues.” A liquor contractor with business interests in Pathankot and Sangrur said, “Besides the lockdown days, we apprehend extra loss of 30% in business due to the closure of taverns (ahatas), marriage palaces, restaurants, clubs, bars, besides an exodus of migrants to their home states.” “Due to the lockdown, the purchasing power of consumers suffered badly and it will have a direct bearing on liquor purchase. The number of opening hours of vends have also been reduced,” said another contractor, asking the government to keep in mind all the factors while framing the excise policy. Earlier, the excise and taxation, and finance departments had suggested not to extend the period of contract for liquor vends beyond March 31, 2021, which was opposite to the contractors’ demand. On Wednesday, CM Amarinder approved the finance department’s recommendation to provide proportionate adjustment of ‘minimum guarantee quota’ for the losses incurred in the 9 days of lockdown in March (2.5% cut from total revenue quota of ₹5,675 crore), which comes out to ₹141 crore. In the current financial year, relaxation of 10% (₹620 crore) was approved of a total of ₹6,200 crore revenue projection.(Inputs from Ludhiana, Patiala, Bathinda, Jalandhar, Sangrur and Amritsar)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/two-third-punjab-liquor-vends-stay-shut-gom-meets-contractors-today/story-vANImi6qEJyyzfCTCzB69J.html

14-05-2020||City||Court extends AAP MLA Jarwal’s police custody by 4 days||New Delhi: A Delhi court on Thursday extended the police custody of Prakash Jarwal, AAP MLA from Deoli, and his aide Kapil Nagar, by four days and sent him to custodial interrogation till May 18 after he was arrested on charges of extortion and abetment to suicide of a 52-year-old doctor last month, stating that custodial interrogation is necessary in the case.In a statement issued earlier when police had booked Jarwal, he had said that he was innocent and that he had not he man for eight or 10 months. “I have proved myself innocent in the past and I will do so now too,” Jarwal had said.Duty Metropolitan Magistrate Harshita Mishra said that a lot of investigation work still remains to be done and several material and facts are yet to be ferreted.“……I find considerable merit in the submissions of the Investigating officer (IO). Despite, grant of 4 days police custody initially, a lot of investigative work still remains to be done and several material facts still need to be ferreted out. Recovery of mobile phone of the accused, Jarwal, which is very vital lead, is still to be affected and even the money trail is to be fully established.“Confrontation of the accused persons with other aggrieved persons and Delhi Jal Board (DJB) officials is yet to be done,” the judge said.The police had sought custody of six days contending that Jarwal is not co-operating in the investigation and have been evasive. The investigation officer, Kumar Rajeev, further submitted that a carefully drafted questionnaire had been given to the accused to get their response regarding the material facts of the case.The police submitted that, however, the accused persons had doggedly failed to reply to them. The IO also told the court that several appalling facts have been revealed from the diary of the deceased which was recovered by the police. He said they have widened the scope of investigation.However, countering these submissions, advocates BS Joon, Mohammad Irshad and Ravi Drall , for the accused, informed the court that the FIR has been registered with malice and political vendetta to tarnish the image of the accused. They said that allegations levelled against the duo are “false and fabricated”.The court also said it cannot be “oblivious and unmindful of the fact that investigation is at a nascent stage and denying further police custody as sought, would tantamount to putting road blocks in the way of effective and expeditious investigation, which still has considerable way to go”.“Court cannot, while adjudicating on a police custody application, adopt an entirely accused-centric approach, unmindful of the prevailing public and societal interest, which hangs in balance. Investigation has to proceed fairly and in an unimpeded and unhindered manner.“In light of the above facts and circumstances, I am of the opinion that the police remand of four days is justified,” the court said.Jarwal and Nagar were arrested by the Delhi police on Saturday after a court had issued non-bailable warrant against the duo. A case was registered against the two after the doctor’s son blamed them for his father’s death on April 18. The doctor also supplied water tankers to the Delhi Jal Board. The family had accused Jarwal of extortion, an allegation denied by the MLA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/court-extends-aap-mla-jarwal-s-police-custody-by-4-days/story-dJarUZH66ELiOGtAxGo3OP.html
14-05-2020||Bangalore||Oppn against Karnataka govt’s proposed ordinance on APMC||Opposition parties, including the JDS on Thursday came out against the Karnataka government’s proposal to amend the laws governing the Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMC), claiming that the move would curtail its powers and also affect the farmers’ interests. The state cabinet to meet this evening is likely to clear an ordinance, which according to government sources is aimed at bringing in reforms to facilitate market access for farmers and usher in APMC reforms. Terming as “incorrect” the government’s move to amend APMC Act through an ordinance at a time when the state was fighting COVID-19, JDS Supremo Deve Gowda in a series of tweets said the government should withdraw it as it was being done without consulting the farmer community and discussing in the assembly. Expressing apprehension that farmers will fall prey to exploitation of capitalists and multinational companies if APMC laws were diluted, he said, there will no protection for ryots if this was done. Gowda’s son and former Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy has warned government of agitation if it goes ahead with the ordinance. Describing the step as ‘submission’ to multinational companies, he said, subjecting farmers to such a risk amounts to “breaking our own back bone.” Alleging that the state government was bringing the amendment at the behest of the Centre, Leader of Opposition Siddaramaiah said it was against the Constitution as agriculture was the state subject. The move will destroy the agriculture sector, he claimed. The state government is said to have taken the ordinance route to amend the APMC Act following the Centre’s suggestion to adopt its Model Agricultural Produce and Livestock Marketing (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2017. The BJP-ruled Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat have already made amendments to the APMC Act. The proposed amendment to agriculture produce marketing committee laws is aimed at removing restrictions on sale of farm produce and allowing farmers to sell their produce anywhere. Recently, Governor Vajubai Vala had returned the ordinance citing procedural reasons, and had asked the cabinet approve it first. The government had earlier planned to take post-facto approval from the Cabinet for the ordinance. The cabinet is also likely to approve an ordinance to amend labour laws in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/oppn-against-karnataka-govt-s-proposed-ordinance-on-apmc/story-9dSW2irHosU5XMKySM9ArO.html

14-05-2020||Kolkata||Kolkata’s pvt bus owners propose three times hike in fares to ensure social distance||Private bus operators in Kolkata have readied a proposal to raise the minimum fare to Rs 20, which is nearly three times the current Rs 7, as they look to restart services adhering to the social distancing norms.At a meeting of the Joint Council of Bus Syndicates, it was decided that fares will have to go up by Rs 5 for every consecutive stage in order to meet the cost of running the vehicles, its secretary Tapan Banerjee said on Thursday.The Transport Department will be informed of the decision, he said.Transport minister Suvendu Adhikary had on Wednesday held a meeting with private bus operators in the city and districts for restarting services in non-containment areas.The minister asked them to propose hikes in fares which will be viable for them in order to ply the vehicles with 20 passengers so that social distance can be maintained in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.“It was decided that Rs 20 will be charged per passenger for the first 4 km, Rs 25 for 5 to 8 km, Rs 30 for 9 to 12 km, Rs 35 for 13 to 16 km, Rs 40 for 17 to 25 km and Re 1 for every kilometre after that,” he said.At present, the fares rise by Rs 1-2 every stage.He said these rates would be applicable to Kolkata Metropolitan Area (KMA).For the districts, the proposed fare is Rs 20 for the first 4 km and Rs 1.50 for every kilometre after that for ordinary buses, while for express buses the fares would be Rs 20 for the first 6 km and Rs 2 for every consecutive kilometre of the journey, Banerjee said.For air-conditioned buses, the fare proposed is Rs 50 for the first 6 km and Rs 2.50 for every kilometre after that, he said.Banerjee said that the minister conveyed to them that restarting bus services in non-containment areas of KMA is being actively considered.Private bus operators in the state had not shown much interest in running buses in the green zones with 20 passengers, claiming that it would lead to huge losses.Even doubling of fares for the private buses, which were allowed to ply in intra-district routes in green zones, failed to persuade the owners, who claimed that a 45-seater bus carries on an average 60 to 70 passengers with scope for standing and it would not be enough for meeting the costs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/kolkata-s-pvt-bus-owners-propose-three-times-hike-in-fares-to-ensure-social-distance/story-2fWh8LsgwkRkPnMZJFktgJ.html

14-05-2020||Chandigarh||Salute the spirit: Father turns author for Kargil War hero||Colonel Virender Nath Thapar (retd) is touching 80 but believes there is one story that needs to be told, and retold, because a nation requires heroes to sustain itself. And so he decided to author a tribute to his soldier son: Vijyant at Kargil: The Biography of a War Hero.The e-book, published by Penguin Random House India, has a nostalgic foreword by then army chief General VP Malik (retd) and will be available online from Friday evening.Captain Vijyant Thapar, a Vir Chakra awardee and fourth generation army officer, was commissioned on December 12, 1998, and joined the 2nd Rajputana Rifles in Gwalior. He was only 22 when he was martyred during the Kargil War in June 1999, having fought bravely in the crucial battles of Tololing and Knoll.Colonel Thapar has co-authored the book that comprises 18 chapters with Neha Dwivedi, a Kargil War martyr’s daughter who is now a Mumbai-based doctor.The book contains a brief overview of the operation by none other than Lt Gen Mohinder Puri (retd), who had commanded 8 Mountain Division that brought the Pakistanis to their knees.PATRIOT AND YOUTH ICONSpeaking about Vijyant and his story, Colonel Thapar says: “Coming generations have a right to such a rich legacy which they can lean on. Vijyant lived and died for the conviction that India is great, an ‘idea’ worth dying for. His life and thoughts must be preserved and passed on to the next generation. This book written by a soldier father on a soldier son, is but a pause for new heroes will emerge from the ashes of Vijyant.”Over the past two decades, Colonel Thapar has written for media publications and has been a motivational speaker at forums, particularly educational institutions, where he shares Capt Vijyant’s inspiring story. “We lost our elder son physically almost 21 years ago but he lives on with us in spirit. He remains a part of the family,” says the proud father, who stays in Noida along with wife Tripta.LOVE FOR THE FORCESThe book is full of anecdotes about Viyant’s early journey to the days in the Indian Military Academy and the experiences that shaped him into a fine officer. Vijyant was nicknamed Robin because of his love for nature.“I admire him now for his high thinking, love for the motherland and the armed forces. He dreamt of serving the country even as a young boy. He had drawn the cockpit controls on his cupboard and would fly high as a kid. His first love was the air force but he eventually joined the infantry like me,” says Colonel Thapar.“During his school days, he never carried the satchel, rather he took pride in the army pithu bag (backpack) with inspirational slogans written all over it,” he recalls.“I have written the story of a remarkable man without any prejudice. His is a story worth telling, and retelling,” he adds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/salute-the-spirit-father-turns-author-for-kargil-war-hero/story-nQXv73oBk3xWqejZYoCrNP.html

14-05-2020||Mumbai||NGO seeks HC relief for inmates after Covid-19 spreads in Maharashtra prisons||Concerned by the spurt in Covid-19 cases in Arthur Road prison, an NGO, People’s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) recently filed a public interest litigation in the Bombay high court (HC) seeking various reliefs for inmates in prisons across the state. The PIL filed through senior advocate Mihir Desai and advocates Isha Khandelwal and Kritika Agarwal was mentioned before the division bench headed by chief justice Dipankar Datta on Tuesday through video conference and has been posted for detailed hearing on May 19.According to the PIL, “Maharashtra prisons, detention centres, juvenile homes are some of the most overcrowded prisons/detention centres in the country. Covid-19 spreads quickly in closed spaces and given the existing overcrowding and resultant poor conditions in Indian prisons, there was an imminent fear of the spread of Covid-19 among the prisoners and the staff in Maharashtra Prison.”The PIL, while seeking directions to the state to improve health and hygiene facilities for inmates and staff, has also sought to allow phone calls and video conferencing for inmates so that they may speak with family members and lawyers who are in panic after it was reported that many inmates and staff of Arthur Road jail had tested positive for the coronavirus disease. The NGO has also sought a report on the number of inmates across the prisons who fall in the vulnerable category and provision of timely health care for non-infected inmates, among other reliefs.The PIL has sought three main prayers and directions. The first being, “The state should file a report on the number of doctors and health workers available in the prison and quarantine centres with information regarding the capacity and the present occupancy of all the prisons, numbers of inmates tested in each prison and their respective results.” It also sought conduction of weekly external inspection of prisons by health officers and provision of N95 masks and other protective gears to inmates and jail staff.The second direction seeks provision of facilities to prisoners to communicate with their family members and lawyers through phone calls or video conference to convey their health status and also sought provision of minimum monthly sustenance for inmates so that they may purchase food and other daily needs as money orders from their families were not reached due to the lockdown. The PIL states that ever since it was reported that a number of inmates and staff of Arthur Road jail and a few inmates of Satara jail had tested positive, there was widespread panic among family members and lawyers.The last prayer by PUCL seeks directions to the state to submit a report detailing measures taken for prevention and preparedness to control Covid-19 outbreak in prisons and other places of detention.

14-05-2020||Mumbai||HC extends deadline to pay liquor licence fees for hotels, bars and restaurants till June 1||In a reprieve for hotels, bars and restaurants serving foreign liquor, the Bombay high court on Tuesday extended the deadline for paying the annual fees for getting their FL-III licences renewed till June 1.FL-III is a licence needed to serve imported and Indian-made foreign liquor at hotels, bars and restaurants. The order came on a petition filed by Hotel and Restaurant Association Western India, challenging a notification issued under provisions of the Maharashtra Potable Liquor (Periodicity and Fees for Grant, Renewal or Continuance of a Licences) Rules, 1996, by which annual fees for this year for FL-III licences was enhanced by 15℅. In the backdrop of the nationwide lockdown, a circular was issued by the state excise department on March 26, allowing the licence holders to pay the enhanced fees in three instalments - 25% by June 30, 25% by September 30 and the remaining 50% by December 31.After members of the petitioner association sought rollback of the enhanced fees, another circular was issued on April 13, giving them an option of paying at pre-revised rates, on the condition that they shall pay the entire amount by April 30.It was then argued on behalf of the association that as the lockdown had been extended, members have not been able to do any business and therefore the condition to pay the entire licence fees by April 30 operated onerously against them. The court was urged to extend the deadline for paying the fees at the pre-revised rates.Additional government pleader Abbey Patki opposed the prayer. He submitted that the licence holders had been given an option to pay at pre-revised rates in one instalment or at revised rates in three instalments and they did not deserve any further extension.Justice NJ Jamadar, however, noted that in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, businesses have come to a standstill and the members of the association were no exception. “Since the government has graciously permitted the licence holders to pay the fees at pre-revised rates, on account of the exigency of the situation, an extension till June 1, 2020 would not cause any serious prejudice to the state,” said justice Jamadar. Although the judge refused to keep it open for the association to move the court and seek a further extension for payment if the lockdown was extended. Jamadar said it would be unreasonable to grant such liberty to the petitioner body.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-extends-deadline-to-pay-liquor-licence-fees-for-hotels-bars-and-restaurants-till-june-1/story-H89yRymZ4jzjsYp47u6SyL.html

The vend owners contended that they had incurred huge losses during the lockdown. The government has formed a panel to assess liquor vendor’s losses during lockdown. The owners have sought relaxations such as reducing the licence fee and slashing VAT. They said the vends were unlikely to make profit given the slide in the economy and the possibility of restrictions being extended by few weeks.NO CLARITY, SAY VENDORS“There is no clarity whether and how the government will compensate us. We opened the vends but later closed them, considering the tepid response from people and confusion over government’s move,” said a vendor.An excise taxation officer, on request of anonymity, said most vendors closed their units in the morning. “Now, around 15% are operating but they too are receiving lukewarm response from public as they are selling only one bottle a person, that, too, at higher rates,” the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/liquor-vends-in-jalandhar-closed-seek-tax-rebate/story-xNXLWYgdy9CDuB8s9AKa9N.html

The BJP has identified about 150 such points across the state, which are mostly being taken by migrants to return to their villages.At these points, the party has deployed its cadre who has started distributing food, water, masks and sanitisers to the harassed migrants.“At many places the migrants were seen travelling barefoot and the party cadres under the direction of UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh and UP BJP general secretary (organisation) Sunil Bansal, are also providing them footwear,” said Manish Dixit of the BJP.Meanwhile, BJP MPs in UP have targeted Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and UPCC chief Ajay Kumar ‘Lallu’ on twitter over Priyanka’s missive to UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath suggesting ways to deal with migrant labourer issue.“Thanks for the advice but chief minister Yogi Adityanath is already active on all these issues. It is nice to know that those who robbed the poor are now giving advice,” tweeted BJP MP Satyadev Pachauri.“It would be still better if Priyanka also gave some advice to chief ministers of party -ruled states in Punjab, Chattisgarh and Maharashtra too where it shares power with Shiv Sena. The governments there are unable to tackle the issue of migrant labourers,” said BJP’s Kannauj MP Subrat Pathak.“CM Yogi Adityanath, a three-term MP doesn’t need advice from a leader whose sole claim to fame is her lineage,” said Farrukhabad MP Mukesh Rajput.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-bjp-deploys-cadre-to-help-migrants/story-ADUL140z5gztqgsG4dCZhK.html
14-05-2020||Lucknow||How UP plans to create jobs for economic recovery||The Uttar Pradesh government faces the challenge of giving jobs to the unemployed following the Covid-19 pandemic as more and more migrant labourers continue to arrive in Uttar Pradesh, which has over 33 lakh registered jobless people.Although UP has seen no upward trend in the number of registered unemployed during the lockdown, there are indications that more people will opt to register themselves when restrictions are eased and more migrant workers arrive in the state.“Our figures of the total unemployed persons has remained static at about 33.90 lakh registrations up to now. In fact, this figure has shown a bit of a decline from 33.93 lakh in February 2020 (before the lockdown) to 33.91 lakh during lockdown-3 (May), as the registrations lapse in three years, if not renewed,” said a senior officer.“Most people do not register while others opting to register online do so using cyber cafes that have remained closed (since the lockdown). The total number of registered unemployed persons may go up when restrictions ease in the coming weeks,” the officer said.The number of job seekers is bound to increase in the post-lockdown scenario as about 10 lakh migrant labourers have already arrived and an equal number are expected to reach the state by May-end.The state government is exploring all options to give a push to the economy and create more jobs for both skilled and unskilled workers. “Yes, chief minister Yogi Adityanath has asked for an action plan to create 20 lakh new jobs. We are working on the strategy and about 10 lakh jobs have been already identified. The exercise to identify more new jobs is underway,” chief secretary RK Tiwari said.As the fourth phase of the lockdown with changes in accordance with the Centre’s directives will begin on May 18, the chief minister has been holding discussions and viewing presentations with his ministers and senior officers to give a final shape to the state government’s future course of action.“We need to turn challenges into opportunities,” Yogi Adityanath said at a meeting convened to discuss measures to give a push to the industry sector.It was at one such high-level meeting that Yogi Adityanath asked senior officers to work out an action plan for creation of additional jobs.He said there were about 90 lakh Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) and if every unit employed one more person, about 90 lakh additional jobs will be created in the state.After implementing a coronavirus action plan and enforcing the lockdown to check the spread of the coronavirus, the state government has begun working on lockdown exit plans, a strategy to push economic activities and ways to provide gainful employment to the people.Loan melas are being organised across the state from May 12 to May 20. Rules have been relaxed and made transparent to set up new industrial units in the state. Construction activities have started on major projects, including expressways, and directives have been issued to allot mining leases to ensure availability of construction material, generate employment and revenue. Hardware shops outside hotspots have been allowed to open and more such activities, like allowing retail business, may be witnessed in the coming weeks. The state government also proposes to utilise the National Skill Development Mission, the National Rural Livelihoods Mission, the One District One Product (ODOP) scheme and the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Scheme and other such government schemes to provide jobs to the people. Already 119 sugar mills, 12000 brick kilns and 2500 cold storages have been functioning during the lockdown providing more than 28 lakh jobs. The state government has been pushing for opening of all the industrial units situated outside hotspots to ensure that all those employed there are not rendered jobless.The state government says the industrial units resuming operations have been able to give work to 2.12 lakh workers. Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) are reportedly giving work to 16.40 lakh people by now while 23.60 lakh were being given work under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Scheme (MGNRES). It seems Uttar Pradesh will, however, have to traverse a long way to economic recovery.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/how-up-plans-to-create-jobs-for-economic-recovery/story-2Y9vY2JMwbtgVFn9p7ACfK.html

Seeing a large number of migrant workers coming out of the Galshaheed area — a hotspot — administration officials swung into action and rushed additional city magistrate Rajesh Kumar to the spot to pacify them.The Moradabad police stopped the workers and made them sit on the road maintaining a safe distance and assured them that their demands would be met.“We have no money or food. All we want is to go back home,” said Ishtiyaq, a migrant labourer.The migrant workers, mostly associated with the brass industry and hotels, said that they were rendered jobless after the lockdown was imposed and had been demanding the district administration to make arrangements to send them back home.

14-05-2020||Lucknow||UP: Covid cases in rural areas a cause for concern||Reports of Covid-19 cases from the state’s rural hinterland has caused concern among state health department experts and officers.Principal secretary, health and family welfare, Amit Mohan Prasad said preliminary reports from districts indicated that fresh Covid cases were reported after the arrival of migrant workers from various states. The health department directed chief medical officers to conduct random tests to find out whether coronavirus was spreading in these areas, he said.A majority of the fresh cases are being reported from districts with a large rural population, including Sant Kabir Nagar, Basti, Banda, Gonda, Bahraich, Jalaun, Siddharth Nagar, Farrukhabad, Jhansi, Bijnor, Sambhal, Pratapgarh, Mainpuri and Hathras. Till mid-March, a majority of these districts were free from the coronavirus.A health department officer said the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) is conducting random tests to study the spread of the Sars-Cov-2 infection among people residing in the rural areas of the state.The respective districts’ administration have been directed to implement the Covid protocol strictly in view of the arrival of a large number of migrant workers.Officials have also been told to conduct thermal screening of the migrants and send the samples of those with symptoms for tests. The remaining migrants will be sent to 21 days’ home quarantine. If the sample tests positive, the infected migrant will be admitted in the isolation ward of a hospital. Even if the test is negative, the migrant will be admitted in a quarantine facility. After nine days, his sample will be sent for another test. If the second report is also negative, the migrant will be sent to home quarantine, he said.Meanwhile, the recovery rate of infected patients has boosted the health department’s morale. The tally of active Covid patients in the state was 1,744 whereas 1,902 patients had been discharged from hospital after recovery, the principal secretary said.Till the first week of April, the maximum Covid cases were from the urban hubs of Noida, Ghaziabad, Agra, Meerut, Kanpur and Lucknow. Cases were also reported from the manufacturing centres of Firozabad, Varanasi, Moradabad, Aligarh, Mathura, Hapur and Saharanpur.To check the spread of the disease, the health department identified hot spots in the urban areas, from where the maximum cases were reported. Soon, containment measures were put in place in the districts and towns. The strategy paid dividends as the health department managed to check a spike in cases in most places, expect Agra, Meerut and Kanpur.After the start of the third phase of the lockdown on May 4, the state government permitted the start of economic activity in districts categorised as orange or green.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/covid-cases-in-rural-areas-a-cause-for-concern/story-igkWY2Y881wIV6AsmVZdIO.html

14-05-2020||Patna||I fear for Nitish govt losing trust of migrant workers: Chirag Paswan||Lok Janshakti Party chief Chirag Paswan on Wednesday said there is perceptible anger among migrant workers from Bihar who are stuck in far-off places and the Nitish Kumar government must bring them back at the earliest, lest it may lose their trust.Paswan accused the Bihar government of dragging its feet on the issue of migrants while states like the BJP-ruled Uttar Pradesh have started bringing its people back by bus-loads.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageHe further said with the Centre running special trains, there was no scope for “excuses” in the name of adherence to the lockdown rules.“I speak as a responsible ally (of the ruling NDA in Bihar)...I can see a lot of anger among migrant workers when I watch their ordeal in videos posted on social media. I fear that they might lose confidence in our government,” Paswan told a news channel. The LJP chief, who took over the reins of the party from his father and Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan less than a year ago, had a couple of days ago alleged that the state government’s response to the migrant crisis was “delayed” and “inadequate” and cryptically remarked that his party “supported” the ruling dispensation in Bihar but was “not its part”.After the election to Lok Sabha of Pashupati Kumar Paras, who was the state minister for fisheries, the LJP has been left without any representation in the state government.The LJP chief’s regular attacks are causing embarrassment for the NDA government in the state, which is scheduled to see elections by the end of this year.Paswan had earlier in the day shot off a fresh letter to Nitish Kumar drawing his attention towards the plight of migrants from Jamui parliamentary constituency who were spread across almost every state in the country.The LJP chief said he expected the state government to “ascertain the number of migrants still stuck elsewhere as early as possible” and thereafter get down to bringing them back by trains or other modes of transport.“No action was taken in Bihar, where the government kept pleading adherence to the lockdown, while the Uttar Pradesh government had begun the process of bringing migrants back by buses. Much time has been lost, there must not be any more dithering,” he added. Thanking Railway Minister Piyush Goyal for “promising that as many trains as needed will be run for Bihar”, Paswan pointed out “now it is the job of the state government to find out as quickly as possible how many of its natives were stuck in which places and place requisitions for bringing them back”.He reiterated that identification of the states migrants was getting hindered by “a tedious process of registration, which required people to get their details entered online, without realising that they were hardly computer literate”.Highlighting the plight of migrants in states like Gujarat and Maharashtra, the LJP chief said “they are living in miserable conditions as 10 people are cramped in a tiny room. Social distancing is simply not possible under such circumstances. The Bihar government must come to their rescue”.Paswan, who had rankled JD(U) leaders a couple of months ago when he repeatedly highlighted its failures during his party’s state-wide “Bihar First Bihari First” tour, which had to be curtailed because of the coronavirus outbreak, also said the state government must ensure that once the migrants were back “blame does not fall on them for worsening of the pandemic”.“In my letter to the chief minister, I have called for ‘saghan parikshan’ (intensive medical tests) of all migrants. Thermal screening, which is taking place, is not enough. The state government must ramp up its medical infrastructure to meet the challenge,” he added.The LJP chief also said Kumar had claimed that soon after becoming the chief minister 15 years ago, “he would be bringing the state’s economy back on track so that those forced to migrate in search of livelihood could return”.“The current crisis throws an opportunity for Nitish Kumar. There are lessons to draw from the adjoining Uttar Pradesh where Yogi Adityanath has been doing a fabulous job by not only taking the lead in bringing the migrants back but also rehabilitating them economically,” Paswan added.There was no immediate reaction from other NDA constituents on the charge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/i-fear-for-nitish-govt-losing-trust-of-migrant-workers-chirag-paswan/story-MMz5NF5uMsUpqPmdcUgjFL.html

As per information, Joginderpal’s cousin Rajinder was behind the attack. A monetary dispute is said to be the reason behind the crime. Police say the accused, who is now on the run, had allegedly hired contract killers and instructed them to kill Joginderpal and both his sons Girish Manocha and Munish Manocha.As per information, two masked men knocked on the door of the Manochas’ residence on late Wednesday night. As soon as Joginderpal opened the door, the accused opened fire on him.He took two bullets and fell down on the floor. Girish, who was standing behind his father, tried to run to his room but the assailants shot him on his back. He succumbed to the bullet wounds at the hospital. Girish had got married only six months ago.Munish, who was in his room at the time, luckily escaped unhurt.ASSAILANTS MADE WHATSAPP CALL TO ACCUSEDAssistant commissioner of police (ACP, North) Gurbinder Singh said that while fleeing, the assailants made a WhatsApp call to Rajinder.

14-05-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana CM Khattar hits out at opposition, says crop procurement going smoothly||Haryana Chief Minister M L Khattar on Wednesday slammed the opposition parties on farmers’ issues, saying they were unnecessarily raising eyebrows when crop procurement was going on smoothly.Crop procurement was going on smoothly, he asserted at a news briefing in the evening held through video-conferencing.“They are unnecessarily raising eyebrows,” he said when asked about the opposition’s claims of mismanagement in wheat and mustard procurement.The chief minister said e-procurement had been done by linking the entire procurement process with ‘Meri Fasal, Mera Byora’ portal which has also brought absolute transparency in the process.He added that payments were being transferred to the farmers’ accounts in five-six days.The chief minister said during the lockdown period, the state government launched a new ‘Mera Paani, Mera Virasat’ scheme aimed to conserve water.He said the opposition’s criticism to this scheme was not justified as water was a meagre resource and its requirement for judicious use has to be factored for agricultural purpose, drinking water and industrial use.Notably, the Congress has said that under the scheme, farmers in several blocks will not be allowed to sow (water-guzzling) paddy and the state government cannot thrust upon them its choice to grow alternate crops like maize and cotton.However, Khattar said that water levels have depleted below 40 metres in many blocks, adding, “We must conserve water for future generations.” He said alternative crops, including maize and pulses, would be procured at the Minimum Support Price.Khattar said under the ‘Mukhya Mantri Parivar Samridhi Yojna’ (MMPSY), financial assistance is being given to 16 lakh poor families.On migrant labourers, he said the state government had made arrangements to send them back to their home states.“We have so far sent nearly 1.25 lakh migrants back to their native places,” he said, adding that as the state government has gradually restarted economic activities, many among the migrants who are still in the state have expressed willingness to stay.The chief minister said the state government was stopping those who were crossing into Haryana on foot or other means and they were being kept at relief camps, where all arrangements were being made to provide food and shelter to them.Further arrangements for sending these migrant labourers to their home states in a phased manner will be made, he added.Khattar said Prime Minister Narendra Modi has pitched for the use of products manufactured in the country and has also said the novel coronavirus outbreak has taught us the importance of local manufacturing, local market and local supply chain.“There was a time when there used to be a craze for foreign things, but today we will have to reverse it,” he said.On contributions received in the ‘Haryana Corona Relief Fund’, Khattar said so far out of total donations of 216.17 crore, Rs 41 crore has been used on medicines, Rs 17.88 crore for labourers working in unorganised sectors, Rs 10 crore has been kept in reserve for giving ex-gratia, while Rs 1.94 crore has been paid towards sending labourers in trains.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-cm-khattar-hits-out-at-opposition-says-crop-procurement-going-smoothly/story-StEkWXUuDuqKnBhO9fSq8K.html
14-05-2020||Delhi||5 lakh suggestions received, policy soon on easing lockdown curbs, says Delhi minister||Delhi health minister Satyendra Jain said on Thursday that the state government has got around five lakh suggestions from the public on Covid-19 and they will be formulating a policy soon.“Chief Minister had sought suggestions from the public, we got around 5 lakh suggestions. A policy is being formulated and you will get to know about it in 2-3 days,” said Jain.Whatever is open, will remain open keeping in mind social distancing, he said on the government’s plan for the next phase of nationwide lockdown.Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had on Tuesday sought views from the people of Delhi on how to ease the curbs when the third phase of lockdown ends on May 17. He had stressed that opening up the city completely was not possible as this stage given the number of new Covid-19 cases every day.News agency PTI reported, quoting a government official, that 4,76,000 WhatsApp messages, 10,700 emails, 39,000 calls apart from 22,700 responses on Change.Org have been received from people. Most people favouring resumption of economic activities, PTI further reported.Kejriwal, who was addressing a press conference digitally on Tueaday, had said that his government is also engaging with experts and doctors to get a holistic view on services that could resume and those that would have to shut after May 17.“I want to know from the people of Delhi whether or not relaxations should be offered. Lockdown can’t be lifted altogether. To what extent should we offer relaxations? In which areas? Should buses or the Metro be allowed to operate? Should autos and cabs be allowed? Should schools, markets, industrial areas be opened? We need your ideas on what all should remain under lockdown and what should be reopened,” Kejriwal said.The appeal to citizens from the CM came a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked all chief ministers to submit lockdown exit plans for their respective states by May 15.During the Prime Minister’s video conference with all chief ministers on Monday, the Delhi CM had appealed to Modi to categorise only the containment zones, not all the 11 revenue districts of the city, as “red zones”.Delhi had 78 containment zones as on Tuesday where relaxations such as opening of standalone shops and industries, movement of people in private vehicles, entry of self-employed persons such as electricians and plumbers is not allowed. These activities are allowed in the rest of the city - which has been otherwise categorised as a red zone by the Centre.With 20 more deaths from the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) reported on Wednesday, Delhi registered the highest single-day increase of Covid-19 fatalities for the second consecutive day. The death toll from the pandemic in the national capital stands at 106.Delhi reported 13 Covid-19 deaths on Tuesday.On Wednesday, Delhi recorded 359 new cases of Covid-19, taking the city’s tally to just two short of 8,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/5-lakh-suggestions-received-policy-soon-on-easing-lockdown-curbs-says-delhi-minister/story-fyWpNP4Wfw0lGaEfUv3nCM.html

The ministry of home affairs (MHA) had on May 11 asked the states to ensure that inter-state movement of medical professionals, nurses, paramedics was facilitated. The directions came after the issue of restrictions being imposed by some states, including Haryana, was flagged during a meeting between the cabinet secretary and state governments on Sunday. “Ensuring unhindered movement of medical professionals is essential for meeting public health requirements and saving precious human lives,” Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla said in his communication to the state governments.Haryana’s additional advocate general Anil Grover had told the court on Tuesday that in furtherance of May 11 directions of the MHA, the state government has evolved a procedure of e-passes, which will be given to medical professionals without any hassle.E-PASSES CAN’T BE FORGEDIn response to a query on why e-passes were being sought by Haryana instead of identity cards issued by central or Delhi governments or hospitals, the AAG had told the court that while identity cards can be forged, e-passes issued by state government cannot be forged as they bear a bar code. He emphasised that e-passes were being issued within minutes of letters or phone calls being received from officials of the central government or hospitals. MATTER COMES UP FOR HEARING TODAYThe court, however, asked the Centre to convince the state government not to press for movement passes and resolve the issue. The matter comes up for hearing on Thursday (May 14).The movement restriction orders are not Delhi-centric, the AAG had told the court, adding that they applied to inter-district travel within Haryana as well as to and fro movement of commuters to Uttar Pradesh. Similar notifications restricting the movement (as the one issued on April 30 by the Sonepat DM) have been issued by the district magistrates of Faridabad, Gurugram and Jhajjar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/haryana-govt-asks-dcs-to-issue-e-passes-for-inter-state-movement-of-employees-engaged-in-essential-services/story-9r1vWzT8hu0AWTSOjaFAVO.html

14-05-2020||Delhi||Delhi hospital director replaced within days of data discrepancy in Covid-19 deaths||The Delhi government removed Dr JC Passey from the position of Medical Director of Lok Nayak hospital on Wednesday. Dr Suresh Kumar from the department of medicine in the hospital has been appointed as the new head of the hospital.The order comes less than a week after Lok Nayak hospital came into focus for reporting around 47 deaths till May 6, when the government had reported only five deaths from the hospital and just 66 across the city. The issue of discrepancy in the deaths reported by Delhi’s official health bulletin and hospital records were highlighted after that.The three-member death audit committee is now working on clearing the backlog.Just four designated Covid-19 hospitals from the city have reported around 173 deaths, but the city’s total toll on Delhi health bulletin on Wednesday was 106.“The Centre had earlier this month sought clarification about why he was appointed as a director above the age of 62. This has nothing to do with the Covid-19 deaths,” said an official from the Delhi government.On May 4, the central government had sought clarification from the Delhi government over the appointment of Dr Passey on an administrative post as he is above the age of 62. The health ministry in 2018 had mandated that doctors above the age of 62 not be given administrative position but instead work in clinical departments till retirement at the age of 65.Dr Passey was a special appointment of the Delhi government in March-end for the management of Covid-19 at Lok Nayak hospital, which is the biggest Covid-19 hospital in the city and caters to only people with the viral infection.With 20 more deaths from the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) reported on Wednesday, Delhi registered the highest single-day increase of Covid-19 fatalities for the second consecutive day.Delhi reported 13 Covid-19 deaths on Tuesday. But even with the sudden spike in deaths, Delhi’s mortality rate continues to be just above one per cent, against the national average of 3.1 per cent.On Wednesday, Delhi recorded 359 new cases of Covid-19, taking the city’s tally to just two short of 8,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-hospital-director-replaced-within-days-of-data-discrepancy-in-covid-19-deaths/story-dHRHoVGkif2rVulvNkR7FN.html

The officials said that the labourer Vinod Kumar Upadhyaya , 42, was found dead on in a train from Maharashtra and the GRP officials got the body to the post mortem house in the night. He was a native of Ayodhya. Two doctors were called from Civil Hospital for the post mortem examination.“The post mortem examination was conducted on the directive of the chief medical officer of Lucknow and the report was positive for coronavirus today. In such a situation all doctors have been asked to stay in quarantine and the post mortem house will be closed for a day for sanitization,” said Dr Sudhir Singh, spokesperson KGMU, where the post mortem house is located.All staff in the post mortem house will also be tested for coronavirus. The GRP staff who brought the body are already in quarantine as they follow a protocol in such cases.Chief medical officer Dr Narendra Agrawal said, “The post mortem was conducted considering the man as coronavirus positive. All staff was in PPE kits and protective gear and there was no need to close the post mortem house.”A medical team in Civil Hospital has also been sent into quarantine as a 20-year-old girl tested positive here.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/autopsy-of-corona-man-post-mortem-house-closed-for-a-day/story-IbmhkNdHvyBh50ne542ouK.html
14-05-2020||Kolkata||Mamata unhappy with central package as money will directly reach beneficiaries: BJP||West Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh on Wednesday claimed that state Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is criticising the economic package of Centre as money will directly reach the beneficiaries.Banerjee herself had sought a special package of Rs 10 lakh crore for states to fight Covid-19 and the Centre came up with a Rs 20 lakh crore package, but she still is unhappy, Ghosh said.“The true beneficiaries of the package - common people - will get the amount directly online without any intermediaries. This perhaps makes her angry as her government is not getting it,” he said.In her first reaction to the 15 measures of the economic package announced by Centre on Wednesday, Banerjee termed it as a “big zero” and said it provided nothing as far as public spending, money transfer to states, MSME and unorganized sector are concerned.The Centre is transferring money of several central projects directly to the beneficiaries as, Ghosh alleged, the Trinamool Congress government had never provided any account for expenses made from central funds.“The Centre will now be channelising money from the PM to DM for different projects so that it reaches the intended people. If possible, it will be done in case of midday meal scheme also in future to stop misuse of funds and prevent her party men from getting cut money,” the BJP MP said.He said the central package will help 45 lakh beneficiaries with seed money to start projects.He alleged that the Mamata Banerjee government is not bearing 15 per cent of train fare of the migrant labourers returning to the state causing economic hardship on them.“You (CM) are forcing the poor labourers to pay train fare from their pockets. Is that fair? You arranged two trains to bring back pilgrims of a particular community and only eight trains to bring around 12,000 of the 3 lakh stranded migrant labourers,” Ghosh said.Asked about her allegations that BJP was spreading “communal virus” in districts even during a crisis like Covid-19, he said, “Mamata Banerjee herself is fanning communalism. Her party men are inciting violence in different areas, to divert attention from her failure to contain Covid- 19, and collapse of the PDS and healthcare systems.” The TMC’s nine-year rule is dotted with incidents of communal and political violence engineered by her party men for political gains, Ghosh alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/mamata-unhappy-with-central-package-as-money-will-directly-reach-beneficiaries-bjp/story-Sh8FvpJ7JZQBgNM2Xp9dVK.html
14-05-2020||City||Covid lockdown: Creative professionals in Ludhiana down, but not out||The lockdown due to the spread of Covid-19 pandemic has changed the ground reality entirely for creative professionals in Ludhiana, with many of them finding that talent has no takers in the prevailing situation.However, they have not lost hope and are waiting for the situation to normalise.“I always believed that having a regular job provides one financial security, but this lockdown has taught me this is truly not the case. Now, I have been working on creating more YouTube content to eventually turn the platform into my regular source of income,” said 23-year-old Harmanpreet Kaur, who, like many other artistes, is also waiting for post lockdown days.Harmanpreet, who has acted in various short movies, said the company, she had been working for, had not paid her for the past two months, and had asked her to work without any incentive.“Even after several requests, the company didn’t release my salary and asked me to work without pay during lockdown, which I turned down. I also approached my contacts for some acting assignments, but there is no work at all. Now, I’m spending most of my time creating content for YouTube and Instagram. My goal is to gain more followers, so that I can get my channel monetised soon,” said Harmanpreet, who is now creating beauty videos for online audiences.Like Harmanpreet, several other independent artistes have been forced to be dependent on their families.Thirty two-year-old Puneet Dharni, a Dugri-based photographer, said there was no demand for photography at present.“People just need essential items. Photography and paintings are of no value. Even the industries, which were our major clients, are struggling to somehow pay salaries to their employees. There is hardly any work for product photographers,” said Puneet.“But, I am paying salary to all my eight team members, including photographers, videographers and designers, from my personal savings,” he added.“They are my team members and I can’t ditch them at this time. I have somehow managed to pay them for March and April, but I have no idea how I will manage to pay them for May,” he added.Similarly, Rupa Arora, who runs a painting academy near Pakhowal Road, said she had been reaching out to architects for work, but in vain.“Conducting an exhibition of my paintings just after the lockdown will not be possible due to the social distancing rule. I have been contacting architects if they have any painting jobs for interiors,” said Arora.Arora, whose specialises in mixed media art, said she had been spending time creating abstract art for bringing positivity in her life during this difficult time.“Instead of artwork on the pandemic, I’m focusing on light art. Creating abstract art always makes me happy. These days, I’m practising a new form of mixed media with metal relief and coffee colours. I hope this pandemic ends soon and artists like me can share their works with the world,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-lockdown-creative-professionals-in-ludhiana-down-but-not-out/story-02qakZYo2WST34EHLfsMHN.html

Under the new definition, units with an investment of less than Rs 1 crore will be under the micro category; previously, this ceiling was Rs 25 lakh.All Industries and Trade Forum (AITF) claimed that now the majority of the benefits will be availed by bigger players and micro units wouldn’t benefit. President of the Chamber of Industrial and Commercial Undertakings (CICU) Upkar Singh Ahuja and general secretary Pankaj Sharma said, “The announcement of Rs 3 lakh crore for providing collateral-free loans is mere eyewash. A similar scheme is already there and it has not worked.”CICU, however, welcomed the decision to invite tenders of up to Rs 200 crore domestically.AITF national president Badish Jindal said, “Change in the definition of MSMEs will destroy the future of the tiny sector. The labour benefits announced are only linked to the Employees Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO), while only 10% of India’s workforce is under it.”Jindal added, “The main concern of the industry was salaries to workers, interest on bank loans, interest-free loans for starting businesses, lower taxation rates, exemption from direct taxes etc. Unfortunately, the government has again failed to deliver.”PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PHDCCI) state mentor and former chairman RS Sachdeva said there was no immediate relief for the industry. “We were expecting relief with regard to labour wages, and interest part of our term loans, which the government said will be postponed for three months. There is nothing of any benefit to industry right now,” he said, expressing dissatisfaction.In Jalandhar, Rajesh Kharbanda, MD, Nivia Sports, said, “Reduction is service tax was a long-term demand, which has been met. Some of the steps will improve liquidity and help restart operations.”(With inputs from Jalandhar and Chandigarh)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rs-20-lakh-cr-central-package-evokes-mixed-response-from-punjab-industry/story-U8hkyhDfHITM61VG09LThL.html

Others entered without screening as well.”“Later, we were called out because fogging had to be carried out, following which we were screened at around 11am,” he said.PU opened its offices after getting the Chandigarh administration’s nod. But, no public dealing will be done and employees will attend on 33% rotation.However, as offices resumed functioning, more than the permissible number of employees allowed showed up, and there was confusion on how to follow the rotation.A security guard at the university said that many staffers were sent back because of this.President of Panjab University Staff (non-teaching) Association (PUSA) Deepak Kashik said, “Some employees had to be sent back on the first day, but now, we have now made the rosters for rotation of employees. We have made every effort to maintain social distancing in offices.”As no public dealing is allowed, checking was conducted at gate number two to ensure no unauthorised person enters the offices.PU registrar Karamjeet Singh said, “We have made all arrangements to ensure smooth functioning of offices.

The duo — Jaspal, a clerk deputed in property tax branch of Zone C, and Sukhpreet singh, peon at the office of first appellate authority — admitted that they had taken ₹200 each from some migrant labourers on Tuesday, said the MC chief, adding that therefore, they had been suspended. She also warned other MC employees of strict action if caught indulging in corrupt practices.The civic body is responsible for ferrying migrant workers from pick-up points to the railway station in buses. Earlier on Tuesday, around 250 migrant labourers staging a protest had blocked the Ludhiana-Delhi National Highway near Kakowal Road, accusing the police and MC employees of not making adequate arrangements for ferrying them to the railway station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/two-ludhiana-mc-employees-suspended-for-demanding-money-from-migrant-workers/story-ggyfvnMPGbapOPXDuxrPfI.html

14-05-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh seeks Centre’s nod on home quarantine of foreign returnees||After several Chandigarh residents put forth the request, the UT administration is seeking permission from the Centre for home quarantining those who return from abroad.So far, the UT administration has been putting them up in private hotels as per Centre’s guidelines. But UT adviser Manoj Parida told HT that he has asked the Centre for permission to allow home quarantine of foreign returnees in Chandigarh, since people are well educated here and houses are large enough to follow self-isolation protocols.“If the Centre agrees, we will allow home quarantine with detail protocol,” he said.Parida also said the Centre frames policies based on conditions across the country. Some states have opened doors to foreign returnees of all economic stratas such as plumbers, electricians etc, but isolating them in their small homes may not be advisable, he said.“But since the situation is different in this city, we are optimistic about the Centre’s nod on this,” said Parida.Seeking the demand, advocate Jaspreet Singh from Sector 8, who is expecting her daughter from Canada soon, said, “We are more apprehensive about the safety of single girls and women quarantined in hotels. When we are ready to follow all protocols for home isolation of our kids, it is unfair to forcefully put them up in hotels.”Another parent from Sector 2, Sanjiv Bindra said that before lockdown, several foreign returnees were successfully quarantined in houses here. Similar care and self isolation is possible now too, he said.Meanwhile, the UT administration is also considering the relocation of discharged positive cases from containment zones to other safe places to prevent a relapse.Parida said there were chances of catching the infection after being discharged. “Till the time the city’s containment zones are not free from the infection, all discharged patients from these areas may be kept in dharamshalas or community centres as part of our overall strategy to contain the virus,” he said, adding that a final decision on this would soon be taken.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-seeks-centre-s-nod-on-home-quarantine-of-foreign-returnees/story-iiJqdcOxpGoJ6wkTdvi71H.html
14-05-2020||City||Pained by joblessness, migrants in Ludhiana protest to be sent back home||Stranded in Ludhiana amid uneployment, over 200 migrants from Bihar took out a protest march on Wednesday.Demanding that the administration send them back home as they had no money or food here, the protesters marched from railway station to the office of the deputy commissioner and then to the Durga Mata Temple near Jagraon Bridge.The workers said they had run out of money and had no support from their employers or administration for ration. “I registered on the Punjab helpline portal around 10 days ago to travel back home through Shramik Special trains, but have not received the date of boarding information yet,” said Mukesh Kumar, a native of Katihar in Bihar.Kumar said he had also applied for ration on the helpline number, but received nothing, adding that the administration should immediately make arrangements to send them to their home states.Another migrant, Shahnawaz, who hails from Bettiah, said he had made several rounds of the railway station and Guru Nanak stadium, but no one was guiding him about the special trains. “I received a confirmation message after applying for the trains a week ago, but have no information on when I can leave,” he said.Additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP-3) Gurpreet Kaur Purewal explained the procedure for the special trains to the protesters, who then left the spot.Earlier on Tuesday, migrants had blocked the Ludhiana-Delhi National Highway near Kakowal Road demanding to be sent back their states.Meanwhile, according to the administration, around seven lakh migrants from Ludhiana have registered on the Punjab helpline portal. So far, on an average, five trains are running daily carrying around 6,000 passengers.On Wednesday, five trains with around 6,000 passengers left the Ludhiana railway station for Hardoi, Fatehpur, Unnao, Gorakhpur and Gonda.Deputy commissioner Pradeep Kumar Agrawal said the frequency of trains will be increased, which will help cater to many more migrants. As many as seven trains will run on Thursday and eight trains on Friday, he added. “The nodal officers of the state are coordinating with governments of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and other states, and they are being requested to increase the number of trains. We are also asking them to allow migrants to come by road, and accordingly we will also allow bus services,” Agrawal said. He appealed to the migrants not to believe in rumours, and patiently wait for information about their date of boarding. “The train and bus services are allowed only after getting approval from the respective districts where they want to travel. So, they should not travel without permission,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pained-by-joblessness-migrants-in-ludhiana-protest-to-be-sent-back-home/story-yvRnwt5sO5fwmZIjiFybuJ.html
14-05-2020||Chandigarh||After fear, uncertainty, homecoming sweet for foreign returnees in Chandigarh||As foreign returnees begin arriving home, they bring tales of despair and suffering with them, brought on by the Covid pandemic and the hardships posed due to consequent shutdown of cities across the world.For the 20-year-old from Attawa village in Sector 42, who arrived on Tuesday night with four other passengers, uncertainty has interrupted his dreams for his future, but he is glad to return home. He had to borrow money to pay for his flight from Singapore, where he was studying. Before reaching Chandigarh, he had to stay at a Delhi hotel for three nights, where a PGIMER doctor returning from Dhaka paid for his stay as he had no money even for a meal.Upon reaching here, he said he was kept for day at Hotel Mountview in Sector 10 on Wednesday which charged ₹5,000 per night. However, it was waived off after intervention by Shashank Anand, the deputy inspector general of police (DIG, traffic) and nodal officer, before he was shifted to a more modest accommodation at Panchayat Bhawan in Sector 36. “Amid the pandemic I see no future, but I am happy to come back to my mother and sister,” said the Attawa youth who lost his father some time ago. He had flown to Singapore in November last year for a six-month diploma course, but the pandemic changed everything.Among the five who returned to Chandigarh were three other students from Singapore, including a class eight student studying in a boarding school here, who arrived in the first batch of returnees. The Attawa youth said he had planned for an internship after studies and wished to stay there longer. “But due to corona, Singapore placed stringent restrictions, and that was that. To stay afloat I worked some odd jobs illegally but it wasn’t sufficient to pay even for accommodation,” he said.“Gurdwaras proved saviours with their free meal service and I was elated when the Indian government announced they would fetch those who wanted to come back. But the flight ticket was almost double the usual fare, so I had to borrow money from a friend in Mohali. I requested the government officials to subsidise air-tickets for those who can’t afford it as there are several students like me facing such hardships on foreign shores,” he addedThe PGIMER doctor who arrived in Chandigarh on Tuesday night was on a sabbatical in Dhaka for two years. After his visa expired in the first week of April, he tried every which way to come home. Although he was staying in safe place, he said the sense of uncertainty about when he would reach home brought on anxiety.“I was worried about my family. My kids were alone at home most of the time as my wife, who is also a medical professional had to go on duty,” he said. Relieved to be back, he says he will have to wait out the quarantine period before he goes home. Even though he feels fine, but he will readily undergo the test and follow all protocols, he added.Patience was a great virtue at such times, he said, adding the he appreciated efforts made by the government. “I could see government agencies working tirelessly to push a system in place for their handling the crisis,” he added.As per UT officials, all foreign returnees will undergo medical tests and stay in quarantine for 14 days before they can go home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/after-fear-uncertainty-homecoming-sweet-for-foreign-returnees-in-chandigarh/story-UleUKUu4aeu90PDWK1zV0I.html
14-05-2020||City||Migrants workers at APMC take up risky ride to reach home||After Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) market in Vashi shut on Monday till May 17, migrant workers from Bangladesh, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh have started going back to their hometown on their own, without waiting for special trains and busses. While Navi Mumbai police commissioner Sanjay Kumar requested them to avoid unsafe journey and wait for special trains, the migrants said that they want to return home at any cost as they were not certain about their livelihood.Sunder Lala, 35, a migrant from Bengal, said, “Earlier there used to be ample of work and we made good money. Since the first lockdown, things have changed and with a reduced number of trucks the work too has reduced.”“I want to go back to my home town now even if it is a risky ride,” said Lala, who stays at Sanpada along with four others from his hometown.The migrants are in rush to claim a seat in overcrowded trucks even if they have to pay between ₹3,000 and ₹5,000 each. They are seen travelling in a risky situation with no masks and overcrowded trucks, but nothing is stopping them to take up this risky ride.“The infection, as well as uncertainty, is increasing here with every passing day. I tried to register myself for Shramik special train, but it seems it will take longer and we cannot wait long. Hence we have decided to go back via truck, van auto whatever option we get,” said Bindesar Rai, 40, from Uttar Pradesh. Rai stays with his wife and 11-year-old daughter in Nerul.Navi Mumbai, police commissioner, Sanjay Kumar said, “Everyone will be sent back to their home safely. I again urge everyone who is talking risky ride to register themselves and opt for safe travel via trains and buses started by the government.”“Most of the state governments have given permission, so more trains and buses will be rolled out. Patience is key, those stranded should wait rather than risking their and their family lives,” said Kumar.Many have exhausted their savings for getting a ride back to home and don’t want to return back soon.“We came here for a better prospect but, there is a lot of uncertainty now. I will be leaving for my home town in Uttar Pradesh in a day,” said Swayambhu Vibhuti, 32, he stays with his friends and brother at Sanpada.Narendra Patil, Mathadi Kamgar leader, APMC said, “ We did assure everyone that work will start after May 17, once the market reopens. While few were convinced others are scared of the virus and reasoned that they want to go back and will come back once the situation improves.”More than 75 people connected with the market, including traders, wholesalers, mathadi workers and members of APMC, have tested positive for Covid-19 since the outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/migrants-workers-at-apmc-take-up-risky-ride-to-reach-home/story-Q3E8Zn7HTWjLqrpbsOzqQI.html

14-05-2020||Chandigarh||HC allows termination of 22-week pregnancy of Chandigarh woman||The Punjab and Haryana high court (HC) on Wednesday allowed termination of 22-week pregnancy of a Chandigarh woman as the foetus was diagnosed with a severe congenital anomaly.The termination of pregnancy was allowed after a panel of doctors at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) opined for the same. The woman had on May 8 approached HC seeking permission for the termination of pregnancy. Following this, the matter was sent by HC for examination by a panel of PGIMER.The Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971, does not permit termination of pregnancy beyond 20 weeks. The law allows termination of pregnancy by a registered medical practitioner, where the duration of the pregnancy does not exceed 12 weeks. If the duration is up to 20 weeks, the pregnancy can be terminated on doctors’ opinion that continuance of the pregnancy would involve a risk to the life of the pregnant woman or can cause grave injury to her physical or mental health. It can also be terminated, if there is a substantial risk to newborn. The PGIMER panel had found that foetus had a severe congenital anomaly with poor prognosis and was not compatible with normal life. The foetus was found affected with Arnold Chiari malformation [type II], a structural defect which leads to underdeveloped brain and a distorted spine.The medical board of PGIMER had also said that there was also possibility of live birth if abortion was performed since it was being performed after 22 weeks. Hence, in such cases injection of ultrasound guided potassium chloride into the fetal heart is advised prior to abortion, to prevent a live birth, the panel had suggested. “In view of the said medical report, this court has no choice but to accept the request of the petitioner, which is also recommended by the permanent medical board,” said a bench of justice Nirmaljit Kaur while allowing the termination of pregnancy with the directions that all necessary facilities for undertaking the procedure be afforded to the patient.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hc-allows-termination-of-22-week-pregnancy-of-chandigarh-woman/story-a0oaSFmQURsfvrBNykfRDK.html

14-05-2020||Mumbai||BMC issues new guidelines, no Covid test during discharge for those with mild symptoms||The newly appointed municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal issued new testing protocol on Wednesday wherein patients who have mild symptoms of Covid-19 do not require testing at the time of discharge, further adding that testing is mandatory only for discharging the patients who were critical. In case of asymptomatic patients, the laboratories have been directed to test only those identified by fever clinics or outpatient sections of private and government hospitals.Further, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has said that no emergency surgery can be denied to patients by the doctors for want of Covid-19 testing. The BMC chief has also allowed home testing only in emergency cases. BMC, in a circular, said that it is issuing revised guidelines of testing by superseding all earlier circulars in light of the government of India and the state government issuing their revised discharge policy as per the categorisation of patients.In a circular issued on Wednesday, BMC stated, “Testing of mild/very mild /pre-symptomatic cases shall not be required before the discharge if there are no symptoms seen on seventh, eighth and ninth days consecutively. In case of moderate symptomatic patients, testing shall not be required if the patient recovered clinically. Testing is required once before discharge in cases of critical patients and immune-compromised patients when they have no symptoms for three days.”In the context of not denying urgent surgeries, the BMC circular has stated, “Only if there is a strong suspicion of Covid-19 in persons requiring elective surgery or surgery which can wait for 48 hours, a doctor can ask for Covid-19 test. No emergency surgeries should be denied to the patient for want of Covid-19 test.”BMC has also asked laboratories to not inform the patients about test results without informing the civic body. The laboratories have been asked to report all positive cases immediately, within one hour of results so that contact-tracing may be initiated at the earliest. For patients on regular haemodialysis, BMC has said that the test should not be asked as a routine before every procedure (dialysis). Contrary to the earlier directions by BMC last week, standard operating procedure issued by Chahal stated that only symptomatic patients who are tested have to be institutionally quarantined. Further, tests for all symptomatic patients can be done only if they have been referred by a registered medical practitioner. The circular mentions that pregnant women, even if asymptomatic, should be tested. The circular read, “Asymptomatic pregnant women should be tested in the facilities where they are expected to deliver .” Dr Sanjay Pattiwar, a public health consultant, said, “The revised guidelines will be helpful as the resources for testing and the infrastructure required are limited. However, considering the density and the parameters of Mumbai, I feel the Central government can also think of having specially dedicated testing for Mumbai in order to flatten the curve.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-issues-new-guidelines-no-covid-test-during-discharge-for-those-with-mild-symptoms/story-eYBm8QYSeqNsunVz8Lo5EI.html

14-05-2020||Chandigarh||50% Covid-19 patients admitted to Chandigarh’s PGIMER in 13-39 age group||Individuals belonging to the young and productive age group of 13-39 years account for half of the cumulative 138 coronavirus cases which are undergoing treatment at or have been discharged from the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER). Following these are those in age group of 40-59 years who account for 28.2% of the cumulative cases. “More number of young patients can be linked to their greater mobility, or moving out of their houses, than other age groups. The young population also mixes up with their peers more than family too. However, it is also observed that most of them are asymptomatic,” said Dr GD Puri, dean (academics), PGIMER.However, scientifically it needs more investigation to say something concrete about it, he stressed. Also, among the affected, 54% are females, but there is no concrete proof to suggest that females are more vulnerable. “Most of the productive individuals belong to the young age group, who move outdoors for professional and family commitments,” said Dr Jagat Ram, director, PGIMER.Dr Sonu Goel, public health expert at PGIMER, said, “The productive age group is the most affected because they travel for work-related things and are more exposed to the virus, which is a national trend.”Compared to other countries, India has a far greater population of those in the age group of 15-60 years. As per 2011 Census data, 29.5% of Indians belong to the 0-15 age group, 62.5% to the 15-59 age group and 8% are aged 60 years and above.HOWEVER, FATALITY RATE HIGH AMONG OLDAs per the information, the fatality rate of cases at PGIMER so far, which stands at 6.5%, has been observed more in the older age group (more than 60 years old).“People in the old age groups should be more protected because chances of fatality are more in them,” Dr Goel said.Experts say quarantining or isolating the contagiously ill people is being done to contain the spread, but the government should think about implementing reverse quarantine for hotspots like Bapu Dham Colony.“Under reverse quarantine, a person who is vulnerable, say old age group, with imminent danger of his contracting the infection from other sick people is kept away until the danger passes,” Dr Goel said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/50-covid-19-patients-admitted-to-chandigarh-s-pgimer-in-13-39-age-group/story-XPHCmyvEcSC0PvzrBl6MfL.html

On May 8, three other male employees had also tested positive.The employees and the manager had resumed work at factory on May 1 after the state government relaxed the curfew restrictions for the industrial sector.The tyre factory has been sealed to contain further spread of the virus.The manager is admitted at Christian Medical College and Hospital (CMCH), Ludhiana, where he remains on ventilator support. A resident of Kabir Nagar, he suffers from hypertension, diabetes and asthma, and had complained of breathlessness, following which he was sampled at the civil hospital and later shifted to CMCH.His wife and son had also tested positive, but are asymptomatic.The employees testing positive on Wednesday are residents of Doraha, Payal, Miller Gunj, Dugri and Haibowal. They are aged 37, 25, 57 , 42, 41, respectively.The other three employees are from Khanna, Dugri and New Sunder Nagar.The factory owners were also tested, and were found negative. SHARED OFFICE SPACEAccording to the health authorities, the manager had been visiting the factory despite suffering from cough and fever.Many of the eight employees found positive share an air-conditioned (AC) room, and as part of daily work, exchanged various documents and files, which may have resulted in them picking up the infection, said a health department official, whose team is tracking the manager’s primary and secondary contacts.TRIO HAD VISITED PRIVATE HOSPITALThe three employees found positive on May 8 had also visited Mohandai Oswal Hospital at Focal Point for a medical check-up on May 7. But, did not disclose that they had been sampled by the health department for Covid-19 testing. This caused anxious moments at the hospital, as news of their results spread.The hospital authorities maintained that they had returned from the OPD after medical check-up.Deputy commissioner (DC) Pradeep Kumar Agrawal said a total of 4,421 samples had been collected in the district, of which reports of 4,048 samples were negative and 141 positive. As many as 13 patients have recovered and been discharged from hospital, while six patients have succumbed to the disease.JAMMU MAN CREMATEDThe 65-year-old Covid-19 patient from Jammu, who died at Dayanand Medical College and Hospital (DMCH) on May 9, was cremated at Ramgarhia Crematorium near Dholewal Military Complex on Wednesday.His cremation was carried out in the presence of two relatives.

14-05-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai may have 45,000 to 46,000 cases by May-end, projects BMC chief||The city’s newly elected Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) chief IS Chahal speaks to HT on the plan to curb the spread of Covid-19 in Mumbai. Excerpts:What is your assessment of Mumbai’s performance in managing the pandemic so far?We are putting in our best. Standard operating procedures are already in place. Ward officers are the backbone of the system. I sat with them for a good 10 hours. People have worked hard and should get due credit for the work they did in the past 50 days. I have told my officers that if Mumbai has 14,000+ cases, and active cases are only around 11,000+, there is no need to feel demoralised. Look at our testing. Maharashtra has carried out 2.30 lakh tests, of which 1.25 lakh are from Mumbai only, which is 33% of the testing in the country. Mumbai has carried out 9,000 tests per million, compared to Delhi’s 4,000 tests per million. These things have not happened automatically. Of course, there are some bottle necks, which we are trying to resolve.What are the bottlenecks you have identified?We started from contact-tracing. How do you identify contacts and quarantine them? In slums, how do you quarantine high-risk contacts? We have deliberated on how to increase the ratio of contacts traced from 1:3 to 1:10. That is, for every one positive patient, trace up to 10 high-risk contacts, instead of the current average of three. We are deliberating on how to make contact-tracing more accurate.Equally important is filing data on the ICMR website. When I joined, it showed only 54% contact-tracing, when we had done 98%. In the past five days, the contact-tracing went to 76%, just by updating the official data. When the Centre sees this, they underestimate Mumbai’s work, [that too] just because the data is not updated. There will be no compromise on data filing.Will you replan the way containment zones are monitored?Yes. I am rationalising the number of containment zones. A population of 5,000 to 6,000 is apt for one containment zone. However, in Mumbai, every building is one containment zone. The so-called 2,800 containment zones in Mumbai looks frightful. But 1,153 are standalone buildings, with one Covid-19 case. The number of containment zones, 2800, which is rising rapidly everyday, scares people. Manning these containment zones is also a waste of police manpower. When I joined on Friday, I saw 250 zones were created in a single day on Thursday. When I went into the details, I found that 50 cases have led to 50 containment zones. One containment zone for one case. This has led to panic. I have drafted a proforma for management committees of these buildings. While health workers can go there, take out comorbid people and disinfect the building, the society will have to ensure no one goes in and out of the building. Self-management of containment zones is necessary. It will reduce the number of containment zones by half.What about the testing protocol?I have announced a new testing policy. There were a lot of ambiguities. For example, if there is an elective surgery, should you do a Covid-19 test or not? When should a pregnant woman get a Covid-19 test done? If someone is going through dialysis, what is the procedure?What other changes will be made?I am making standard operating procedures for everything. We have 307 flu clinics (fever clinics) and we want to impose ‘military-type’ discipline there. I have drafted a format which says when you [the doctor at the clinic] recommend someone’s test, you will have to certify that he is symptomatic, and that he has not been given any treatment, any paracetamol. It is not your business to prescribe treatment. You have to certify that you are following ICMR guidelines while prescribing tests. If anyone is found violating this, their licence will be cancelled. Tomorrow no one can accuse us and say we were trying to curb a patient’s symptoms by giving medicines. I have issued vertical orders for tasks given to all officers. Everyone should know who should do what. If a municipal commissioner is in-charge of Mumbai and all its aspects, a ward officer can be in-charge of his ward in the same way.What is the worst-case scenario expected for Mumbai?I am projecting 23,000-odd active cases in Mumbai by May 21-23. This month, the total may reach 45,000-46,000 cases. When I joined last Friday, the doubling rate was eight days. As of Tuesday evening, it has become 10.9 days, so almost 11 days. I have 14,900 cases, but active cases are 11,500 after deleting cases of discharges and deaths. That is how we are calculating the cases for Mumbai.Is Mumbai prepared to handle it?At least 60-65% of those quarantined are in our Covid Care Centres (CCC), where we have 35,000 beds. The remaining 40% are in health centres and hospitals [(dedicated Covid health centres (DCHC), and dedicated Covid hospitals (DCH)]. The capacity of our DCHC and DCH is 4,200 beds. Presently, 400 beds are vacant.The BMC has planned that 200 beds will be added from the government’s side daily. We are also going for jumbo ICUs now at SevenHills hospital, BKC grounds, JJ Hospital and St George hospital. Private hospitals have promised me they will create additional beds for Mumbai. With all this, Mumbai can jump to 8,000 beds very fast, and be ahead of the Covid-19 outbreak’s pace.Moreover, I am trying to enhance beds at CCCs as well. Today I am visiting NCSI dome, where we are establishing a 50-bed ICU, which can be scaled up to 200 beds. Similarly, beds at the BKC grounds are reaching 1,000. At BKC grounds, I plan to put 300 ICU beds and make it into a DCHC. When will Mumbai flatten the curve?The lockdown is a very good decision. Our cases are 14,000+, and our doubling rate is 10 days. This rate will remain only if Mumbai gets 1,400 cases in one day, but instead we are getting 600 to 700 cases. So Mumbai may touch the doubling rate of 14 in 3-4 days. The moment that happens, even if it happens in seven days, by May 20 or 21, Mumbai can compete with the 14-day cycle, due to the new discharge policy of the Government of India. If some patients can get discharged on the 7th or 8th day or the 10th day and the doubling rate is touching 14, it will show a downward curve. In another scenario, some of these patients will still take a maximum of 14 days to be discharged and because the doubling rate is projected to be 14, another person will come to occupy the same bed in 14 days. Bed management will stabilise. By May 31, the doubling rate can go up to 17 or 18 and the battle is almost won.How long can the lockdown practically last?I am very open to kickstarting the economy of the city, but we have to be very wise while doing it. Yesterday, I opened the entire diamond market of Mumbai. In the diamond market, where there is very limited labour and specialised labour, and there are ₹5,000-crore exports waiting to happen, opening up the market can be beneficial. Next, I will look at Nariman Point. But none of these can happen at the cost of spreading Covid-19. If I feel something is going to spread Covid-19, like opening a wine shop with long queues, then I am not going to change that till the end of May.Do you think there will be a situation where you may have to take a stance contradictory to the state or Centre, like it happened with opening of liquor shops? I have already discussed this with the chief minister and chief secretary of Maharashtra. I have said I will take the government into confidence before taking any decision for Mumbai. Once we announce a decision on BMC level, it shall not be changed. What is your assessment of Dharavi?When I was in Dharavi, I asked the ward officer to show me a map of Dharavi, and show me in colours where all the virus has spread. I was surprised to see there are no Covid-19 cases in 80% of Dharavi. There has to be a difference between a containment zone in Dharavi and in a posh 30-storey building in the rest of the city. They cannot have the same parameters. How challenging is this posting?I was monitoring Covid-19 at state level for the past 50 days. I got associated with Covid-19 [management work] on March 21, when the Maharashtra government announced the lockdown. The chief minister made me in-charge of monitoring the entire state, my Google drives are filled with 34 collectors and 27 municipal commissioner’s data, monitoring their contact-tracing efforts, containment zones and hospital categories. I was doing all of this for the entire state. In April, I made the hospital management plan – CCCs, DCHCs, and DCHs for the state. When I joined the BMC, I was already 45 days into the fight.How prepared is Mumbai to handle the monsoon?Every week, once or twice I am going to inspect the nullahs and Mithi river. At Mithi, instead of eight hours, dredging is happening for 16 hours. The road work was suffering due to lack of labour. We now have a software that will estimate how much cement is needed for any stretch of road. I have asked them to use the software and make payments, so dozens of people don’t have to stand on the road taking measurements for work to commence. The work will speed up.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/boosting-bed-capacity-to-handle-covid-spread-bmc-chief/story-yWFPsXkbO0UhSujxbk9ytM.html

Headquartered at Beas (Punjab), the Radha Soami Satsang Beas, a spiritual organisation based on the teachings of all religions, has given as many as 10 lakh food packets to the local administrations of Mohali, Chandigarh and Panchkula for further distribution.Food is prepared at three centres of the sect – in Mohali, Chandigarh and Panchkula - twice a day.At the Mohali centre in Sector 76, around 100 followers prepare 12,000 food packets a day. A follower said, “We get all the ration from our headquarters in Beas and by Wednesday, we have given around 5 lakh packets to the administration. The packets were also given to migrant workers leaving for their native places in trains. Now since most of the migrant workers have left the district, we will be reducing the number of packets to 50% from May 18.”Punjab health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu had also visited the Mohali centre and applauded the selfless service of the followers.Mohali sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Jagdeep Sehgal said, “Whenever we need it, we just tell them and they deliver hygienic food in no time.”Similarly at the Chandigarh centre in Sector 27, around 5,000 food packets are prepared by 70 workers every day. “Within seven weeks, the centre has prepared and given around 2.35 lakh food packets to us to date, which is not an easy thing to do,” said SDM (south), Chandigarh, Manish Lohan.The Panchkula centre in Saket, where around 5,400 packets are prepared every day, has contributed 2.53 lakh food packets to date. Panchkula SDM Dheeraj Chahal said, “Around 150 workers at the centre have been fulfilling our requirement since day one.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/10-lakh-food-packets-and-counting-radha-soami-satsang-beas-doing-its-bit-for-chandigarh-tricity-s-needy/story-MVqhom2P5GfOqpy9XqY6NP.html
14-05-2020||Mumbai||Maha sees biggest 1-day spike of 1,495 cases, tally passes 25K||Maharashtra on Wednesday registered its highest single-day jump in coronavirus cases and deaths with 1,495 new infections and 54 more deaths, taking the tally past 25,000 to 25,922 and toll to 975.The country’s worst-affected city, Mumbai, breached the 15,000 mark with 800 new cases, taking its count to 15,747.According to the data provided by the state health department, of the deaths recorded on Wednesday, 40 were in Mumbai, six in Pune, two each in Jalgaon, Solapur and Aurangabad, and one each in Vasai-Virar and Ratnagiri. The health department said it has not added Mumbai’s 220 patients from May 7 to the total due to the absence of reconciliation on the portal of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).More than 50% of the state’s Covid-19 cases have come in this month alone. The first case was on March 9. From May 1 to May 13, Maharashtra has clocked 13,820 cases, 53.31% of the total.According to the state health department, 422 patients recovered from Covid-19 on Wednesday, taking the total number of recoveries to 5,547. The state has, so far, conducted 2,30,857 tests, of which 2.03,439 have tested negative. Meanwhile, the Covid-19 count in other hotspots is Pune city: 2,830; Thane city: 1,122; Navi Mumbai 1,018; Malegaon: 617 and Aurangabad: 586. Meanwhile, to ease the pressure off the state police who are enforcing the lockdown, the state government has asked for 20 companies of the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF) from the Centre. Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had last week indicated that the state could seek additional forces from the Centre to give a break to the state police force in phases. Several police officers and personnel have been affected by coronavirus infections, while police personnel are under a lot of strain.“Many Maharashtra police personnel have tested positive for the virus and need time to rest and recuperate,” he said, adding that May 25 is Eid and the state would need an augmented security presence to ensure law and order is not disturbed. “We’ve hence asked for 20 CAPF companies to be deployed urgently to help the police,” said state home minister Anil Deshmukh.The state government is now also looking at providing supplementary treatment of Ayurvedic, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy (AYUSH) medicines along with allopathy treatment for Covid-19 patients, who are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms. The state medical education and drugs department issued a government resolution to form a task force on AYUSH for Covid-19 under Dr TP Lahane, director of medical education and research.The nine-member panel, which also has former city mayor Dr Shubha Raul, will prepare guidelines for a treatment protocol, said Dr Kuldeep Raj Kohli, director of Ayush Maharashtra and joint chairman of the task force.“The objective is to how best we can use Ayush in Maharashtra during this Covid-19 outbreak. The task forces would prepare a treatment protocol for people who are quarantined, are asymptomatic, or have mild symptoms. It would need clearance from the state’s Covid task force. People now are taking different types of medicine. At least they would get a guideline. People would then take medicines that the task force has asked to be taken,” Kohli said. He added that no form of allopathy treatment would be stopped for patients. Ayush treatment, if approved, would be complementary.A state health department official said that other states such as Gujarat have tried Ayurvedic medicine on asymptomatic patients in Ahmedabad. Similarly, a small group of patients may be given medicines prescribed by the task force as a trial to see the duration of recovery.Meanwhile, as numbers continue to soar in Aurangabad city, state health minister Rajesh Tope and district’s guardian minister Subhash Desai individually took stock of the preparedness. Tope has set up a task force to tackle the rising number of cases. The city has 586 cases and 18 deaths. The doubling rate in the city stands at eight days, which the civic body has brought down from 4.5 days earlier this month. Malegaon, in Nashik district, is another hotspot in the state where cases have seen a surge. Tope visited Malegaon on Wednesday to take stock of the situation and preparedness.Aurangabad, which is a hotspot, has 12 containment zones with 55 localities. Desai, who inspected the preparedness in the city, said, “There AMC (Aurangabad Municipal Corporation) has kept 4,000 beds available. Therefore, in case there is a spike, later on, there is no fear of any shortage of hospital beds. Besides, district medical college has kept 450 beds to treat severe and critical cases. The arrangements are so far adequate. We have planned in such a manner that around 50 beds will be available for patients.”Desai added that the industries department, which he heads, has allowed a 5,702 sq m industrial facility in the city to be converted into a 250-bed Covid-Care Centre in a month’s time.Maharashtra has, so far, tested 2,30,857 samples at both government and private-testing facilities. According to the data provided by the medical education department, the percentage of people found positive has increased from 7% earlier this month to 12% on May 13. Health department officials are attributing this increase to an increasing number of tests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maha-sees-biggest-1-day-spike-of-1-495-cases-tally-passes-25k/story-FWFzrvsCAdOg3PCU1AwRLP.html

The victim, a student of Class 10, whose identity is being concealed as he is a minor, was living in Channalo village in Kurali with his mother after she had separated from her husband.Police said the victim’s two cousins (both sisters) of Khanpur had eloped with two boys staying in a house in their neighbourhood. The girls had returned home, following which the victim and other relatives went to the boys’ house to confront them on May 8. Arguments snowballed into a clash, following which the victim’s relatives fled, but he was caught, beaten up, and stabbed by a member of the other family with a sharp-edged weapon.The victim was taken to the Kurali civil hospital from where he was referred to the Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, Chandigarh, where he died during treatment on May 12.Kharar (city) station house officer Baghwant Singh said a murder case under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code was registered against Sukhwinder Singh alias Sukha, Lucky alias Lakwinder Singh, Gurpreet Singh alias Vicky, Manpreet Singh alias Ladi along with 6 unknown residents of Khanpur.Earlier on May 8, two residents of Khanpur who were at the spot and got injured amid the stone pelting during the clash, had given in writing to the police that they had struck a compromise with the girls’ family.

14-05-2020||Chandigarh||64% samples tested for Covid-19 at Chandigarh’s PGIMER are from Punjab, Haryana||In Chandigarh’s main Covid-19 testing centre at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), 64% samples are from the neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana. With even the other two testing centres, at Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Sector 32, and the Institute of Microbial Technology (IMTECH), under pressure, delivery of results, even those of pregnant women, are getting delayed, it has been learnt.As of now, the PGIMER is testing the highest number of samples in a day in the city, having dealt with 6,678 from March 7 to May 11. In comparison, IMTECH has tested 1,831 samples till May 6 (started from the third week of April) and 1,200 have been tested at GMCH from March 25 to May 11.PGIMER data reveals that of 6,678 samples, the highest number (2,898) came from Punjab, followed by Chandigarh (2,401) and Haryana (1,364).“The institute is catering to not only the tricity (Chandigarh, Mohali and Panchkula), but also some other districts of Punjab, such as Jalandhar and Rupnagar, on request. In Haryana, we cater to Ambala and Yamunanagar as well,” says Dr Mini P Singh, nodal officer, Covid-19 laboratory services, PGIMER.Admitting to the “pressure” this puts on the existing infrastructure, she says the lab remains closed for only two to three hours a day. “We are providing training to adjoining states. We have already trained 11 officials from laboratories in the northern region and currently nine more are undergoing training. We hope the adjoining states will soon gear up for more testing,” says Dr Singh.Manuj Tripathi, who is the IMTECH official spokesperson, says though their laboratory receives samples from Chandigarh, Punjab and Haryana, the institute does not maintain area-wise data.A GMCH official, not wishing to be named, says 40 to 55 samples are received daily, almost all of them from Chandigarh. “Ours is a small lab and we test only samples from the city and very few from other states. So far, we have tested 1,200 samples.”Meanwhile, a Government Multi Specialty Hospital (GMSH), Sector 16, official, not wishing to be named, claimed reports of samples of pregnant women “sent to the IMTECH laboratory” are being received after 48 hours. Recently, three women were tested Covid-19 positive after they delivered babies, exposing several staff and other women to risk. “The reports are received after 48 hours. We want these should be sent within six to seven hours,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/64-samples-tested-for-covid-19-at-chandigarh-s-pgimer-are-from-punjab-haryana/story-A5HNS3raxudhO6FP8L4y7K.html
14-05-2020||Chandigarh||PGIMER begins using TB machine for quicker Covid testing||The Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) started using tuberculosis machine - GeneXpert - for quicker diagnosis of coronavirus disease (Covid) on Wednesday.The GeneXpert was launched in PGIMER in 2016 to diagnose multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) for speedy detection of TB.Dr Arunaloke Chakrabarti, head, medical microbiology, said, “The GeneXpert testing is a very sensitive and quick procedure. We get results within 45 minutes and can hand over report to the patient within an hour.”The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing system generates results in 6-7 hours.Chakrabarti said, “But the major problem is of the availability of cartridges. We only have 300 and are trying to get 1,000 more. One cartridge is used for one patient. So, we will use this test only in cases that are too critical and need quick intervention. For instance, in a case of a patient with severe head injury, who cannot wait for seven hours and needs immediate surgery.”Dr Chakrabarti said that the lab will work 24x7 to tend to emergency cases as and when they come.MENTORING OTHER STATES FOR LABSDr Mini P Singh, nodal officer, Covid-19 laboratory services, PGIMER, said, “The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has appointed the PGIMER as mentor institute for some states to approve new laboratories to start polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing system and GeneXpert.”The PGIMER has been allocated Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Chandigarh, and Uttarakhand.Singh said, “We have recently approved a laboratory in Ambala and one at PGIMER to start the GeneXpert test for Covid-19. Similarly, labs in General Hospital and Command Hospital, both in Panchkula, have been approved to start PCR testing. The Punjab Biotechnology Incubator and National Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research, Mohali, have also approached us expressing interest in starting Covid testing.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pgimer-begins-using-tb-machine-for-quicker-covid-testing/story-u66QGcSx7XIRcLoNbUajwI.html
14-05-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh admn halts migrant registration after rush from other districts||The UT administration stopped registration for Shramik special trains after around 5,000 migrants from Punjab and Haryana thronged the Inter State Bus Terminal (ISBT) in Sector 43, Chandigarh, with valid passes, leading to chaos on Wednesday.Police had to resort to lathicharge to bring the situation under control.“The online portal for registration was meant for migrants living in Chandigarh. However, it did not seek any valid identity proof from those applying. Sensing an opportunity, migrants from across the region applied on the portal and secured passes,” said a police official, who was on duty at the bus stand.Police said the migrants reached the bus stand at 5am for screening and boarding the bus to the railway station.Yashpal Garg, UT social welfare secretary, said, “People who reached the bus stand from other districts are now advised not to enter Chandigarh because their journey will be arranged by authorities of their respective districts.”He said the online registration had been suspended and only migrants with registration numbers will be allowed.“For the past four days, trains were carrying around 1,180 passengers in each round, but today 1,488 people were accommodated in a train as the number of migrants went beyond the prescribed limit. As the migrants included women and children, they were allowed to travel,” said a police official, requesting anonymity as he was not authorised to talk to media.With the UT administration refusing people having valid registration to board trains and asking them to return, panicked gripped the migrants, who then did not follow the social-distancing norms and rushed towards the counters.A senior police official said, “We had no option, but to use mild force to control the crowd.”Meanwhile, migrants claimed that the administration had intimated them about the details of their journeys. “We were only asked to show confirmation of registration and we did. But instead of being taken to the train, we were thrashed,” said Sonu, one of the migrants, who wanted to return to Bihar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-admn-halts-migrant-registration-after-rush-from-other-districts/story-8aoTroi3MBPSjM0gx9ictL.html
14-05-2020||Chandigarh||Rs 20-lakh cr package evokes mixed response from Punjab industry||The state’s industry has given a mixed response to the Rs 20-lakh crore economic package, the details of which were announced by Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman at a press conference on Wednesday. Welcoming the change in definition of the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), Federation of Industrial and Commercial Organisations (FICO) chairman KK Seth and president Gurmeet Singh Kular said special relief was still missing. Under the new definition, units with an investment of less than Rs 1 crore will be under the micro category; previously, this ceiling was Rs 25 lakh.All Industries and Trade Forum (AITF) claimed that now the majority of the benefits would be availed by bigger players and micro units wouldn’t benefit. President of the Chamber of Industrial and Commercial Undertakings (CICU) Upkar Singh Ahuja and general secreary Pankaj Sharma said, “The announcement of Rs 3 lakh crore for providing collateral-free loans is mere eyewash. A similar scheme is already there and it has not worked” The CICU, however, welcomed the decision to invite tenders of up to Rs 200 crore domestically.AITF national president Badish Jindal said, “Change in the definition of MSMEs will destroy the future of the tiny sector. The labour benefits announced are only linked to the Employees Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO), while only 10% of India’s workforce is under it.”Jindal added, “The main concern of the industry was salaries to workers, interest on bank loans, interest-free loans for starting businesses, lower taxation rates, exemption from direct taxes etc. Unfortunately, the government has again failed to deliver.”PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PHDCCI) state mentor and former chairman RS Sachdeva said there was no immediate relief for the industry. “We were expecting relief with regard to labour wages, and interest part of our term loans, which the government said will be postponed for three months. There is nothing of any benefit to industry right now,” he said, expressing dissatisfaction.In Jalandhar, Rajesh Kharbanda, MD, Nivia Sports, said, “Reduction is service tax was a long-term demand, which has been met. Some of the steps will improve liquidity and help restart operations.”— With inputs from Jalandhar and Chandigarh||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/rs-20-lakh-cr-package-evokes-mixed-response-from-punjab-industry/story-6kgYzD8A23lAuGE9TLZvRP.html
14-05-2020||Noida||GB Nagar gets one more Covid-19 testing and plasma therapy centre||Gautam Budh Nagar district got its third Covid-19 testing centre on Wednesday with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) approving the Super Speciality Paediatric Hospital & Post Graduate Teaching Institute (SSPHPGTI) in Sector 30. The apex Indian body for biomedical research also permitted the hospital to administer plasma therapy on trial basis to Covid-19 patients.The Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) in Greater Noida and National Institute of Biologicals in Noida are the other two testing centers, while GIMS also has approval to administer plasma therapy.Plasma therapy involves treating the patient with the plasma of a compatible patient who recovered from Covid-19. The antibodies present in the plasma is expected to help the patient fight off the infection.Sharda Hospital in Greater Noida and Jaypee Hospital in Noida’s sector 128 await the final nod from the state authorities to use their molecular labs for Covid-19 testing.With more testing centers coming up in the district, it is expected that it will reduce the time to test samples. Recently, the NIB sent over 100 samples to the GIMS lab following a technical snag. GIMS also faced the similar problem few days back following which many results were returned “inconclusive”.“The laboratory has been approved for Covid– 19 testing by ICMR and as per recommendations of King George’s Medical University (KGMU, in Lucknow) after remote assessment of the laboratory quality and facility. External Quality Result Validation with National Institute of Biologicals, Noida was also done with control samples before commencement of the facility,” informed the SSPHPGTI authorities.The hospital has also started a Covid Plasma Registry which will work as a plasma reserve of all blood groups, to serve as the nodal centre for anybody who needs plasma at national level, informed Dr DK Gupta, director, SSPHPGTI. Six more casesGB Nagar recorded six more Covid-19 cases on Wednesday taking the total to 236 in the district.The new patients include a 34-year-old man from the Sector 66, he contracted infection through the earlier cases in the area. Recently, a 62-year-old man had died from the area. A 51-year-old man from sector 5 and a 24-year-old man from sector 8 of Noida were also found positive for the infection. Officials are suspecting that the patient from sector 5 is part of the Ceasefire trail as four persons including a domestic help of an employee of fire safety solutions company Ceasefire, who was found positive earlier.The cluster of JJ Colony in Sector 8, 9 and 10 is the most problematic cluster for the officials to contain the Covid-19 spread in the district. Around 54 persons have been found positive for the deadly virus from the JJ Colony of sectors 8, 9 and 10 till now.A 30-year-old male doctor working in a private hospital and a resident of Jewar and a 30-year-old woman from sector 76 of Noida were also found positive. Their source of infection is yet to be identified. The woman lives with her husband in a residential society and her source of infection is yet to be identified as she has not been going out since the lockdown was announced.A 22-year-old man from sector 22 was also found positive and he is expected to have contracted the infection from the two elderly couple who were found positive earlier. The 60-year-old husband of the woman had died on Monday night.Two patients were discharged from the Sharda Hospital including a 25-year-old Afghan national from Greater Noida and a 42-year-old man from the sector 8 of Noida. By Wednesday night, the health department collected a total of 4376 samples. Currently, there are 90 active Covid-19 cases in the district.

14-05-2020||Noida||Noida: Police couple donates blood to Covid-19 patient on dialysis||With most hospitals facing a shortage of blood, as donors are staying away due to the ongoing lockdown, a deputy superintendent of police (DSP) and her husband, the station house officer (SHO) of the Knowledge Park police station, came forward to donate blood to a 53-year-old woman diagnosed with the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and in need of dialysis.The 53-year-old has been undergoing treatment at Sharda Hospital in Greater Noida and needed a dialysis -- a process of removing excess water and toxins from the blood in people whose kidneys can no longer perform these functions naturally-- after she developed kidney issues.The woman needed blood for dialysis and the hospital staff were finding it tough to arrange it as their blood banks are running dry and donor numbers have decreased. As the hospital falls under the jurisdiction of the Knowledge Park police station, SHO Baljeet Singh, 38, came to know of the crisis and he decided to volunteer.The patient’s blood group was O+ and the SHO’s was also O+. The DSP’s blood group was A+. Initially, the relatives of the woman were reluctant to come forward to give blood as she had Covid-19 but after the SHO and his wife came forward, they, too, did so at a later stage.His wife Rajni, 44, posted as DSP in Meerut, was also in town when Singh decided to donate blood. She, too, volunteered and gave blood. Doctors said the woman patient has almost recovered from the Covid-19 and is expected to be discharged soon. “I had come to know that the hospital needed blood for the woman and I decided to volunteer. I am happy that my wife also volunteered for the cause. Blood banks have been facing a shortage following the lockdown. We are happy that the woman is recovering. Every person should come forward in this crisis to help one another,” Baljeet Singh said.Rotary Noida Blood Bank has been trying to encourage volunteers to come forward and donate blood. “We have been appealing to our volunteers and others to come forward and donate blood. We are following the scientific and the safest way to collect blood and donors need not be scared. We recently organised two blood donation camps in the district and many had attended these camps,” Sudhir Walia, trustee, Rotary Noida Blood Bank, said.“We were arranging blood for the patient when the SHO came to know about the matter. He and his wife donated blood. We need more such officers and people to come forward to help out patients. The woman has recovered and will be discharged soon. She has been undergoing treatment for Covid-19 and dialysis for around 20 days,” Dr Ajit Kumar, joint registrar and media spokesperson, Sharda University, Greater Noida, said.Indian medical Association said the administration should encourage and appreciate people who are coming out to donate blood. “It is important that people are encouraged to donate blood as there is a health crisis in the country. If we will appreciate the work of such volunteers, then it will motivate others. The administration should provide pickup and drop facilities to donors to encourage people,” Dr NK Sharma, president, IMA (Noida) said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-police-couple-donates-blood-to-covid-19-patient-on-dialysis/story-nZWVgoNbNJXfzriTGEu7gO.html
14-05-2020||Noida||Residents demand vendors supplying essential goods be tested for Covid-19||Residents of various housing societies in Noida have demanded that the administration conduct Covid-19 tests on all security guards, sanitation employees, vendors supplying essential goods and others who move in and out of housing societies on an urgent basis. Earlier, the administration had announced that it will conduct tests of persons supplying essential services and goods to residents, but officials said lack of sufficient Covid-19 testing kits has stalled the process. Gautam Budh Nagar district residents’ welfare association (DDRWA), a residents’ group, had also written to the Uttar Pradesh government and Narendra Bhooshan, the in-charge of district to handle Covid-19 outbreak, demanding these tests. Residents also put forth their demands during a webinar attended by Bhooshan on Tuesday. In the one-hour long webinar, at least 40 people from Noida and Greater Noida interacted with officials.“We demanded that the administration conduct the Covid-19 tests on all those who are daily on the ground, either cleaning or collecting garbage or supplying essential goods to each household. These people daily interact with residents and it is necessary to ensure that they are infection-free,” NP Singh, president, DDRWA, said.There are at least 900 vendors in Noida and 700 in Greater Noida supplying vegetables, fruits, medicines and groceries to households. There are 33 hot spots where vendors are delivering services at doorstep and in the remaining areas, essential services are being delivered at society gates, officials said.“Apart from vendors, the security guards manning housing societies should also be tested. It is not only important for their safety but also for that of residents who interact with them,” Sanjeev Kumar,Sector 51 RWA general secretary, said.There are at least 5,000 sanitation employees in Noida and about 1,000 in Greater Noida engaged in collecting garbage, sweeping and cleaning parks and roads.“The administration must test the sanitation employees because they touch all common areas while cleaning or collecting garbage,” Lokesh Sharma, a resident of Knowledge Park-4, Greater Noida, said.However, to conduct tests of all such people is not possible for the administration.“We will follow laid down guidelines on conducting tests as there is a clear protocol on how to go about it. The vendors or the firms that engage such people can get their employees tested at health department facilities and if anyone is symptomatic, then a Covid-19 test can done. We cannot test all of them at one go due to limited number of testing kits available,” Bhooshan, who is also the chief executive officer of the Greater Noida authority, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/residents-demand-vendors-supplying-essential-goods-be-tested-for-covid/story-PHFqAZXvYAkE4lqBhnjglO.html
14-05-2020||Mumbai||2,500 asymptomatic patients in Mumbai to be discharged to free up beds||The 35,009 beds in Mumbai that were reserved for asymptomatic Covid-19 patients will now be kept for symptomatic patients only. The 2,500-odd asymptomatic patients who are kept under observation at Covid care centres (CCC) will be discharged soon as per the new policy of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).As per the earlier guidelines issued by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), high-risk contacts of Covid patients with comorbidities were shifted to CCC-1, while asymptomatic patients who did not require critical care were sent to CCC-2. Serious patients with fever and low oxygen saturation were sent to dedicated Covid hospitals (DCH).However, according to the new rules, all asymptomatic patients will be discharged from CCC-2 and will be kept under home quarantine. This will free up beds at CCC-2 for patients showing mild symptoms and those who do not require critical care.“It is up to the doctors to decide who is mildly, moderately, and severely infected. Normally, patients who just have a cough and cold with no other complications would be kept in CCC-2 while patients with fever and low oxygen saturation with breathing problems would be shifted to hospitals,” said Dr Pramod Ingale, former dean of Lokmanya Tilak Municipal General Hospital, also known as Sion hospital. Dr Daksha Shah, deputy health officer also confirmed the new development.At present, 2,425 asymptomatic patients have been kept under observation in converted CCC-2 in 138 schools, 15 buildings, 19 hospitals, 40 halls, and several gymkhanas and hotels. If they do not develop any symptoms, they will be discharged and all the 35,009 beds that were reserved for asymptomatic patients will be saved for the treatment of mild symptomatic patients.“Our main priority is symptomatic patients, so we will reserve all these beds for them. If they develop complications, then we will shift them to dedicated hospitals. We are also in the process of increasing the number of Covid beds in hospitals,” said Dr Ramesh Bharmal, director of major civic-run hospitals and current dean of Sion hospital.The plan to discharge these asymptomatic patients has raised concerns among health activists. They have opined that if asymptomatic patients are discharged in red zones like Dharavi, Worli, Govandi, and Kandivli, the virus may spread further as social distancing is an uphill task in these congested areas.“Most people in Mumbai stay in one-bedroom houses and many others in slums where social distancing is a myth. Just being a carrier of the virus doesn’t mean that the asymptomatic patient can’t spread it to others. It is impossible to maintain safety in congested areas with common toilets,” said Dr Ravikant Singh, a health activist.When HT asked ward officers about this safety aspect of the discharge plan, they said that there is no clarification on the matter so far. “We are not in favour of this new rule. We have segregated the patients after days of fieldwork. Now, if we release them, we will be back to square one,” said a ward officer, on condition of anonymity.However, as per BMC officials, asymptomatic patients from slums will be given alternative accommodation. “During discharge, all these patients’ profiles are being checked. If anyone is found to be staying in slums, congested areas, or with family members with high-risk comorbidities, we will make alternative arrangements. Patients can even request the doctor in-charge for a separate accommodation after discharge,” said Dr Gautam Bhansali from Bombay Hospital, who is part of BMC’s Covid team.Highest CCC-2 bed count in these five wardsAn analysis of the data shows that the G/N ward, comprising Dharavi, Dadar, and Mahim, has a maximum number of asymptomatic patients kept under CCC-2 facilities. Among the 24 BMC wards, this area has recorded 1,230 cases — highest in the city. It is followed by G/S ward which has 13 CCC-2 centres with 5,868-bed facilities. The ward has 272 asymptomatic patients and they are kept under observation at the National Sports Club of India, Worli, which has 500 beds. This ward has recorded the second-highest number of Covid cases in the city.E ward, has 2,917 beds of which 221 are occupied by asymptomatic patients. Out of this, 123 are admitted to a Nagpada maternity home. This ward comprises areas like Byculla, Mumbai Central, and Nagpada, with 1,046 Covid cases. L ward has six centres with 2,899-bed capacity, however, only 180 of them are occupied. In the fifth position, H/E ward has 164 asymptomatic patients undergoing treatment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/2-500-asymptomatic-patients-in-mumbai-to-be-discharged-to-free-up-beds/story-WX2UiSaksorCrOq8iTxPRK.html

Be ready to shell out as much as Rs10,000 for a taxi ride from the Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGIA) to any destination within a 250km radius. While scores of people are stranded at different places and struggling to reach home due to the outbreak of coronavirus disease (Covid-19), the minimum cost of booking a taxi of the UPSRTC will be Rs 10,000 for sedans and Rs 12,000 for an SUV. Any additional distance, beyond the 250km, will incur additional charges. If your pockets don’t run so deep, the corporation’s buses will ply you, for a minimum of Rs 1,000 per seat in non air-conditioned bus and for Rs 1,320 per seat in air-conditioned bus for a distance of up to 100km.UPSRTC managing director Raj Shekhar, on May 9, issued a letter to the corporation’s regional managers in Noida and Ghaziabad, informing them that they will facilitate the travel of residents -- brought back from foreign countries under the Vande Bharat Mission -- from Delhi airport to Noida and Ghaziabad and other nearby areas. “The corporation will provide buses and taxis at the airport. Those people who would be cleared by the Delhi government to travel and have no symptoms of Covid-19, can avail of this service,” the letter said.The letter adds that booking a taxi for up to 250 km from the airport would cost Rs 10,000. “Each additional kilometre would cost Rs 40. Booking an SUV would cost Rs 12,000 for first 250km and Rs 50 for each additional kilometre,” it said. Besides the driver, only two persons can sit in the taxi,” it further stated.A single seat in a non air-conditioned bus would cost Rs 1,000 and a seat in an air-conditioned bus would cost Rs 1,320 for 100km. The charges would double for any distance 101-200km. The buses will accommodate a maximum of 26 persons, in order to maintain social distancing. At present, all people brought back from foreign countries are kept in 14-day quarantine in Delhi. Once they complete the quarantine period, the transport department would facilitate their travel to Noida, Ghaziabad and other cities.AK Singh, regional manager, UPSRTC, Ghaziabad, said he has received the letter. “At present, we engage our buses to ferry passengers from Delhi airport to different hotels and quarantine centres in Delhi. We have received the order from the headquarters to ferry returnees in buses and taxis. They will be transported as per the directions of the Delhi government and Ghaziabad administration,” he said. Singh did not comment on the high fare structure, except to say that it was decided by the headquarters. “We have received information that stranded people are sometimes fleeced by truck drivers and others promising lifts. Such commuting is also unsafe while the government initiative is safe,” he said.Anurag Yadav, assistant regional manager, UPSRTC, Noida, said until now some UPSRTC buses have ferried migrant people from Noida to other districts of Uttar Pradesh as well as to other states, on the directions of district administration. “The services to transport migrant workers were free of cost. Now, we have received a letter from the headquarters to ply buses and taxis from the Delhi airport. We will take suitable measures once the administration gives us the nod,” he said.KK Jain, general secretary, FONRWA, criticised the exorbitant fares and said it will further burden travellers. “We used to commute from Noida to IGIA for Rs 800 before the lockdown. A fare of Rs 10,000 for a single trip to Noida or Ghaziabad is too much. The government should reconsider the fare structure to help people who are already troubled by the lockdown the coronavirus spread,” he said.Responding to the news report, Raj Shekhar, UPSRTC managing director, on Thursday said that a three-member committee has been formed to review the order. “The officials of department of operation, technical and regional transport authority are members of this committee. They will look into the matter and submit recommendations in 24 hours. We may introduce some changes in the fare structure,” he said.Shekhar said that the Corporation had issued a letter for chartered rates for 250-km radius commuting. “This was not limited to Noida and Ghaziabad from Delhi airport. People can book the taxi from the airport for whole day and travel to different district like Bareilly, Moradabad, Meerut, etc. The taxi drivers will come with empty vehicles and they can’t book or lift commuters on return. The commuters need not to share the ride with others, unlike the other taxi services,” he said.Shekhar said that at present the people brought from abroad are quarantined in Delhi. “We have engaged some buses to ferry them from Airport to the hotels. We have not charged them any money till now,” he said. The Corporation is yet to start this chartered bus and taxi service from the Airport.Shekhar added that UPSRTC is reviewing its order specially pertaining to Noida, Ghaziabad commuting from Delhi. UPSRTC runs over 10,000 buses while it has a few taxis in each district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/upsrtc-to-charge-10-000-for-taxi-rides-from-delhi-airport-to-noida-ghaziabad/story-5ykwGP7A2FP3xLTHBVIOON.html
14-05-2020||Delhi||Delhi police to separate law and order duties from investigation||Delhi police will soon separate law and order and investigation duties in an attempt to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) among members of the force, according to a senior police officer who requested anonymity.Personnel posted on the streets on law and order duties will be advised not to visit the police stations and those at the stations won’t have to step out into the field, the officer said. The two groups will interchange their work after completing their shifts.At least 110 police officers of the rank of constable to a deputy commissioner of police(DCP) have tested positive for the disease. A 32-year-old constable died last week. More than 1,000 police personnel are in home quarantineFrom securing containment zones to maintaining social distancing on the roads, at liquor vends, markets and shelters for the homeless to feeding the hungry and maintaining law and order, police have been at the forefront of the fight against Covid-19 pandemic.“One, the division in work happens. This will be like our own work-from-home culture. The field duty officers can directly go home or to the facilities set up by the department for them. Keeping the police station premises sanitised is important. It is the place from where we maintain the law and order of the area and ensure all citizens are safe. This will be the first time that such a division on duties will happen,” the police officer said.Another officer said the police were adopting different measures to ensure that the virus does not seriously affect their work. To ensure that barracks inside stations and homes of the police personnel are safe, the department has arranged accommodation for at least 12,000 police officials on field duty in hostels, colleges, guest houses, hotels and community halls. Last month, the Chandni Mahal police station was sealed and at least eight policemen tested Covid-19 positive. The transmission had happened inside the barracks of the station where the constables lived.“We will ensure that the morale of our men and women is high. We are in this fight together. We have taken help from citizens and have space for 12,000 police officials, who need to be isolated or want to self-quarantine after completing their jobs,” the second officer said.With relaxations in the lockdown norms leading to more people on the roads, police apprehend more Covid-19 cases in the force. Many senior officers of the ranks of the special commissioner have been given additional responsibilities. The traffic chief is now in charge of overseeing the admission of police personnel in hospitals in critical cases. Other officers have been given tasks such as visiting police stations every day to check on social distancing measures and counselling the junior-most officers. There is also a team that visits police colonies to ensure that all families who need self-isolation are looked after. With ambulance vehicles in high demand, police have also converted some of their police vans into ambulance vehicles for police personnel and their families.“Our force is squarely meeting the challenges of prevention of infection and treatment and thus fine-tuning containment strategy on a day to day basis. At every station and unit, around 15% of staff are in self-isolation or leave. They are ready to join anytime. Many are also returning from quarantine or recovering from the disease. There is no cause of panic. We are prepared for the fight,” a third officer said.Retired Indian Police Service officer Prakash Singh, whose public interest litigation led to the Supreme Court passing landmark police reforms in 2006, said that if the Covid-19 pandemic has led to the division of law and order with investigation duties in police stations, it is a laudable initiative. Separation of law and order from investigation duties was part of the reforms mentioned by the apex court. “The importance of the police is evident in these times. This is the same force that was facing criticism for their handling of many cases recently. We have all read reports of the selfless work they have been doing at this time. They are in the frontline. If circumstances (police personnel getting infected with the virus) has forced them to make the division, then it’s a good move. Today they are working beyond their mandate. If this becomes permanent and is replicated across the country, it will lead to reforms in the true sense. And no government will have a problem with this division. It is just about the division of work, managing it and getting more manpower.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-police-to-separate-law-and-order-duties-from-investigation/story-cGgyoOk8w9qNt2pjX1tKyH.html
14-05-2020||Delhi||City doctors perform surgeries on Covid-19 patients with extreme care||Surgeons at Lok Nayak hospital, the 2,000-bed hospital dedicated to patients infected with the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), have performed at least 15 surgeries on such patients.Of these, 14 were caesarean operations and one was to stem uncontrolled bleeding.This is the highest number of surgeries performed on Covid-19 patients in a city hospital.There have been at least four such surgeries at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), which accommodates the second-highest number of Covid-19 patients and has a dedicated operation theatre for suspected and positive Covid-19 patients.There are 578 Covid-19 positive patients admitted to Lok Nayak hospital and 403 admitted to AIIMS, according to the daily data shared by the government.“There have been four surgeries performed on Covid-19 positive patients so far, including two C-sections,” Dr DK Sharma, medical superintendent of AIIMS, said.Since the virus is highly infectious, the doctors have had to take several measures, such as changing the air-supply mechanism in operation theatres and using a fibre-glass box for the intubation of patients to reduce the risk of healthcare workers contracting the infection.At Lok Nayak hospital, an isolated air conditioning system and an exhaust are used to create a negative pressure environment that does not allow the virus to escape the operating theatre.“To further reduce the healthcare workers’ chances of exposure to the virus inside the room, a fibreglass box is placed over the face of the person undergoing surgery while they are intubated or given anaesthesia. Both these procedures generate aerosols from the respiratory tract, which contain the highest viral load,” Dr Bharti Wadhwa, professor, department of anaesthesiology at Lok Nayak hospital, said. The doctors also use a video-guided laryngoscope to perform the intubation so that they do not have to look down the throat of an infected person.Working with personal protective equipment (PPE) is a challenge as it reduces the doctors’ visibility by 60%.“We have to don a sterile gown and gloves over the PPE kits, which are not sterile and might pass on an infection to the patient. With the layers of material, it is not just hot to work in the OTs, it also reduces our efficiency by 40%,” Dr Wadhwa said.“Within 10 minutes of starting the surgery, the goggles and face shields get foggy because of perspiration. This reduces our vision by 60%. So, the doctors have to depend on their experience and tactile memory to work through the surgery,” Dr Abhishek Singh of the department of anaesthesia at AIIMS said.Currently, only emergent procedures wherein the patient would not survive without surgery for the next 24 hours are performed despite the patient testing positive. Other elective surgeries have been postponed.“For non-emergency procedures, a patient is tested to determine whether (s)he is infected before the surgery is performed,” Dr Singh said.“The emergency surgeries—even wherein the patient is suspected to have the infection—are being performed with adequate protective gear. The most common emergency surgeries are caesarean sections and other obstetric surgeries. Other than that, orthopaedic surgeries are also taking place—people have not stopped breaking their bones and falling. Road traffic accidents have reduced, but are not zero. And, doctors at AIIMS are performing some basic surgeries such as cancer surgeries that cannot wait,” Dr Anjan Trikha, professor of anaesthesiology and critical care at AIIMS, said.Three OTs are running round-the-clock at the hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/city-doctors-perform-routine-surgeries-on-covid-patients-with-extreme-care/story-KpS8U70ELtjha1laElfXcO.html
14-05-2020||Chandigarh||Private schools challenge Chandigarh ban on fee collection amid Covid-19 lockdown||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Wednesday put the Chandigarh administration on notice on a plea from private schools challenging the UT’s move to bar schools from taking fee during the Covid-19 lockdown. The petition has been filed by the local Independent Schools’ Association and seven private schools. The city has 77 private schools, who have dragged the UT to high court.“It is hoped that taking into account the urgency, the respondent-authority shall take an appropriate call by the next date of hearing, after hearing the petitioners,” the bench of justice Nirmaljit Kaur said, while posting the matter for further hearing on May 22, and asking the UT to file a reply within one week from Wednesday. The petitioners had told court that the decision restraining schools from collection of fee is ‘without any basis and jurisdiction’ and ‘totally arbitrary’. The institutes are bound to pay and disburse the salary of teachers and other staff, for which they need to generate funds, which is possible only through the fees collected from students, the court was told, adding that it was not the case that the parents did not have a source of income during this lockdown period.BONE OF CONTENTIONThe bone of contention between the UT and schools are two orders from the administration on fee issue. While the March 30 order directs schools to reschedule the last date of collection of fee and funds for the 2020-21 session to a date at least one month after the reopening of schools, another communication under challenge is that of April 7, when the UT asked private schools to not send any message to parents for depositing fee. The schools were warned that any violation would lead to withdrawal of recognition. Following this, schools approached the administration asking it to allow them to collect fee or pay the salaries, a plea treated with cold shoulders by the UT. The schools were asked to provide their balance sheets, which most of them did not agree to. ‘WE HAVE TO PAY SALARIES’Now, the standoff continues and teachers and other staff members of these schools are waiting for their salaries, even for the month of April. “Schools managements are conscious of the difficult times that the world is going through, but the respondents seems to have lost sight of material aspect that all schools have taken steps to conduct online classes,” the court was told. The court was also told that besides salaries, schools have other liabilities, such as taxes, electricity and water bills, and any kind of leeway to parents to not pay the fee would cause hardship to the schools and would have a cascading effect. The schools have also underlined the fact that it was not clear as to when lockdown would end, when schools would reopen and what sort of arrangements they would have to take to follow the norms of social distancing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pvt-schools-challenge-chandigarh-ban-of-fee-collection/story-TPIwxOo0nvxLTPyjxnFKJN.html
14-05-2020||Delhi||Liquor worth Rs 84 crore sold in Delhi during May 4-12||With around 10% of the total number of liquor shops functional in the city currently in the light of lockdown restrictions, Delhi recorded alcohol sales of around Rs 9.33 crore per day between May 4 and May 12, government records show.Data shared by the state excise department show that Delhi recorded sale of liquor worth around Rs 84 crore between May 4 and May 12. The alcohol sales also fetched the goverment around Rs 55 crore as “special corona fee” which has been levied at the rate of 70% of MRP on all categories of liquor since May 5.Delhi has 864 registered liquor shops, of which 172 were allowed to open from May 4, when the nationwide lockdown was extended for two weeks but with scaled down restrictions. With fewer shops opening, massive crowds were witnessed outside liquor shops and there was rampant violation of social distancing norms.All 172 liquor shops, which qualified as standalone units outside markets and malls under guidelines issued by the Union home ministry, are government shops and they sell indian manufactured foreign liquor and country liquor. Imported liquor is still our of bounds for residents is the city.However, only around 80-90 shops have been able to function regularly, with the others still remaining closed for reasons ranging from inadequate stock to shut down for violation of social distancing norms, government officials said.While the city government did not allow private liquor shops to open, they initiated a system of e-coupon for liquor purchase from the government shops and are deliberating on provision for home delivery of liquor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/liquor-worth-rs-84-crore-sold-in-delhi-during-may-4-12/story-6epqRxlRHkOX7ev3wiI6TN.html
14-05-2020||Gurugram||Lockdown 3.0: Around 500 students make their way back home to J&K||Close to 500 students from Jammu and Kashmir were evacuated from Haryana on Wednesday, more than six weeks after a nationwide lockdown was imposed to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The students were ferried from six districts—Gurugram, Faridabad, Ambala, Hisar, Nuh and Yamunanagar—in 23 buses dispatched by the J&K administration. The second phase of evacuation, for labourers and professionals currently stranded in the state, is scheduled for later this week, officials said. “Our priority was to ensure that students can get home to their families. We will continue to make similar arrangements for other migrants,” Dr Inderjot Singh, manager at Jammu & Kashmir House in Chandigarh, and a liaison officer for J&K migrants in Haryana. Earlier, between May 7 and May 9, at least 25 buses left Chandigarh for J&K, carrying about 200 students and 700 workers back home, Singh confirmed. As per official rolls, a total of 499 students left for J&K from Haryana, of which 333 were from Gurugram. A total of 15 buses left the district around 7pm on Wednesday. Similarly, three buses ferried 70 students from Ambala, two buses from Faridabad carried 37 students, while one bus each was dispatched to Hisar, Nuh and Yamunanagar by the Jammu and Kashmir State Road Transport Corporation to bring back 59 students scattered across these districts. The buses arrived in Haryana early Wednesday. “The students were screened for symptoms at camps and government hospitals in their areas starting Tuesday. They will all be screened a second time at Lakhanpur, on the Punjab-J&K border,” Arshad Yousuf, executive director of the Jammu and Kashmir chapter of the International Human Rights Organisation (a non-profit body), which has been working with district authorities to ensure their passage back home. “The students were required to first register on the J&K administration portal for stranded migrants before they could be screened,” Arshad added. In Gurugram, students were screened at Civil Hospital in Sector 10 before being granted medical certificates, allowing them to make the interstate journey back home. None of the students showed any symptoms, a health department official at Civil Hospital confirmed, seeking anonymity. Hindustan Times had reported on May 11 that several students and workers stranded in Gurugram were facing uncertainty over their chances of returning to J&K. Several of the students who HT spoke with were able to return on Wednesday. One of them, Hamidullah Malik, a resident of Kupwara district who has been living in Gurugram’s Sector 18 while preparing for the National Eligibility Test (NET), said, “For weeks after the lockdown we had no idea what would happen. In the last few days, we have been unable to properly speak to our friends and families due to the Internet shutdown in Kashmir. It is a relief to finally be on our way.” Aman Yadav, nodal officer for migrant travel back to J&K, did not respond to requests seeking comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/close-to-500-students-make-their-way-back-home-to-j-k/story-mRnos5a5sHtsYk0eIacEOM.html
14-05-2020||Gurugram||Five new Covid-19 cases in Gurugram, total cases in city reach 166||The Gurugram district health department on Wednesday confirmed five new Covid-19 cases on Wednesday. Till Wednesay, 166 cases were reported from Gurugram. Of them, 99 were undergoing treatment and 67 were discharged.According to chief medical officer, Dr. Jaswant Singh Punia, among the new cases is that of a woman who contracted the disease days after her domestic help tested positive for the virus.“The house help stayed with the family and had tested positive earlier this week. We are still tracing how the house help contracted the coronavirus. But we have taken the samples of the family members. The infected woman, being a high-risk patient (she suffers from hypertensjon), has been admitted to Medeor Hospital in Manesar,” he said.Currently, asymptomatic patients or those with mild symptoms are being admitted to ESIC hospital, sector 9. A family of four from Jyoti Park was shifted to Nuh medical college earlier this week after they had complained of poor amenities at the hospital. Sirhaul, one of the affected zones, has also reported two new cases. “Two persons reported positive from Sirhaul worked at Udyog Vihar. One is an employee at an export factory while other works at a call centre. They both were in contact with a patient who tested positive in Sirhaul as they stayed in the same area,” said Punia. Till now, 15 cases have been reported from Sirhaul village. In Basai, where over four Covid-19 cases have been reported, a fresh case emerged on Wednesday. A man working in a medical equipment factory in Basai was confirmed positive. “He stayed in the same area where he worked and was in contact with the coronavirus cases reported earlier from the area,” said Punia. A woman, who worked as a helper in a sheet-making factory, also tested positive. The woman stayed in Sheetla Colony where no Covid-19 case has been reported earlier. Punia said the team is trying to trace her contacts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/five-new-cases-in-gurugram/story-kghZS40xAwoeS4fXMuxnkJ.html
14-05-2020||Gurugram||Covid-19: With course curriculum in mind, schools shorten summer breaks||Private schools in the city are opting for shorter summer breaks this year, after more than a month of holding online classes for students amid the nationwide lockdown imposed in March to curb the spread of coronavirus.While some schools have already declared vacations for students of junior classes, others will be breaking for the summer in the coming weeks. Schools said that they have reduced the duration of the break by a few days to make up for the loss of physical classes, where learning happens at a faster pace.Amity International School, Sector 43, has announced a month-long vacation starting May 15. The students in primary classes have already been on a break since the last week, and the remaining classes will take a break from Saturday. Compared to its usual summer break schedule, the duration has been reduced by a week this time.Anshu Arora, school principal, said that the break had been reduced by about 10 days since children were anyway holed up inside their homes due to the lockdown. “Children are not going out of their homes. They don’t have many options for indulging in various activities outside. After months of online teaching, however, a break was needed. This will at least keep them in the system of having a break. Moreover, the break will give students a chance to revise whatever has been covered so far,” said Arora.She added that the break would also give teachers a window to prepare for the future. “Without any preparation, teachers got into online classes overnight. This break was much-needed for them and will help everyone get back to classes with a renewed energy,’ said Arora.Students have been given creative hands-on activities as part of the holiday homework to keep them occupied. “Keeping the time in mind and knowing that students will not be able to move outside, we have designed activities that can be done at home,” she said.DAV Public School in Sector 14 has reduced its summer break by two weeks this year, as the school will be going for a three-week break from May 24 till June 14. School principal Aparna Erry said that the break had been reduced to offset the relatively slower pace of online classes. “Earlier, we used to have classes from 7.30am to 2pm. Due to the lockdown, we have online classes from 9am till 1pm. We need to compensate for the time, since the speed of covering the syllabus is slower,” said Erry.She said that the school was not in favour of holding online classes for longer due to the eye strain it could cause and with much left to be covered, a shorter vacation schedule was decided upon. “For students in board classes, there is a significant amount of work that needs to be done. We are trying to ensure that the syllabus is covered without putting too much pressure on students,” said Erry.Amity International School, Sector 46, declared summer vacations for the junior school last week, while senior wing students will be going on a break from Saturday. “Children needed a break. Too much screen time is not healthy for their eyes,” said Arti Chopra, school principal.Among schools that released summer vacation schedules were Lotus Valley International and Kunskapsskolan, which will be closing from the last week of May. The former will be shut from May 30 to July 5, while the latter will shut from May 24 and May 29, for junior and senior classes, respectively.Shiv Nadar School, which closed this week, will be shut till June 15.Administrations of other private schools, meanwhile, are holding deliberations on the dates for the vacation. Officials of Manav Rachna International, Sector 46, said that they are waiting to see if the government issues a directive in this regard, before announcing their schedule.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/with-course-curriculum-in-mind-schools-shorten-summer-breaks/story-WzW1moTCzmT9cJFKosj7sK.html
14-05-2020||Delhi||Firefighters to sanitise equipment after every operation during pandemic: New SOP||Every firefighter’s equipment and fire tenders used in rescue operations during the Covid-19 pandemic will be thoroughly disinfected before being reused, state the Delhi Fire Service’s (DFS) newly framed standard operating procedures (SOP).Senior officers said because firemen need to carry evacuees on their backs or shoulders, with no scope of social distancing, they will have to disinfect shoes, hazmat suit, helmet, equipment as well as themselves, before resuming work, in order to contain the spread of the virus within the force. For this purpose, the DFS has purchased a manual disinfecting machine, one each for all 63 fire stations in Delhi.The DFS has so far not reported any Covid-19 case.The new SOPs were formalised in the first week of May, keeping in mind the onset of summer. Every year, Delhi reports more than 3,000 incidents of fire on an average, a majority of them in May, June and July.Atul Garg, director, DFS, said, “We are expecting fire incidents to go up in summer, like every year, but this time it’s going to be different. Because of the pandemic, our functioning has been affected. In the past, there have been rescue operations where we have had to lift 30 to 50 people from one building or area. In such cases, we cannot waste time worrying about getting close to unknown people who may be infected with Covid-19. Therefore, we framed the new SOP in a meeting.”According to the new plan, every firefighter who exits his fire station will undergo a thorough disinfecting procedure upon return. “His clothes, fire suit, helmets, goggles, equipment, boots and gloves will be sanitised. Even the fire tender used to douse a fire in densely populated areas will be cleaned upon return,” Garg said.Garg said the force is short-staffed. He said though no case has been reported in the force, they are taking all precautions. The firefighters, because they travel together, will wear masks under the helmets. which are a mandatory part of their uniform. The helmets also have a protective visor that will act as a second layer of protection.The director said that to ensure that such additional measures do not waste crucial time, the exercise to sanitise the firemen and fire tenders will be conducted only once a firefighting operation is over.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/firefighters-to-sanitise-equipment-after-every-operation-during-pandemic-new-sop/story-Sxuvv9BjUeacsrJidxjT5I.html
14-05-2020||Delhi||Delhi CM gets over 500,000 suggestions for a post-lockdown Capital||From recommending the odd-even rule for private vehicles, and opening alternate shops on alternate days, to seeking a ban on paan and gutka to curb spitting, residents and professionals sent over five lakh suggestions to the Delhi government over a span of about 29 hours, the chief minister’s office said on Wednesday. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, on Tuesday, had sought suggestions from the public on relaxations that could be allowed in the Capital after May 17, when the third phase of national lockdown is scheduled to end, with a deadline of 5pm on Wednesday. By that time, the chief minister received 5,48,700 suggestions.“The response to the CM’s call for suggestions has been overwhelming. We received over 4.76 lakh WhatsApp messages, nearly 10,700 email, around 39,000 recorded messages on call, and 22,700 responses in a petition at Change.org,” the chief minister’s office said. “The responses have been received under various categories such as industrial and MSME operations, transport, education, and day-to-day activities of the people like commercial and non-commercial activities,” a media advisor to the CM said.The Capital has been in varying degrees of lockdown effectively since the Janta Curfew on March 22.Senior Delhi government officials said the chief minister will hold consultations with experts, doctors and top bureaucrats from across departments on Thursday to draft the final proposal for the national Capital that will be sent to the Prime Minister’s Office. “The proposal will definitely include the Delhi government’s recommendation that red zones in the Capital be either identified on the basis of containment zones or wards. Apart from this, restricted operations of offices, industries and shops will continue. But there are a lot of varied views on whether malls, shopping complexes, markets should be allowed or not. These will be decided on Thursday,” a senior government official said. A second official said that even though the Delhi government will send its own proposal to the PMO like other states, any relaxations after May 17 will depend on guidelines that the Union home ministry issues.“Transport minister Kailash Gahlot held a review meeting on Wednesday to discuss the possibilities of opening public transport if needed. It was observed that decisions such as allowing public transport — and if so, how much of it should be permitted, can be firmed up only once the new set of guidelines on lockdown 4.0 is issued by the MHA. So, even though what the Delhi government wants will be clear by Thursday, an official order from the city administration on the new rules for lockdown 4.0 will come only after the MHA releases its order,” the official saidA number of resident welfare associations (RWAs) demanded that Covid-19 testing in private labs be made free and that the labs be reimbursed from the PM Cares Fund. In one mail, at least 74 RWAs — from Dwarka, Greater Kailash, Asiad Village, Vasant Kunj, Defence Colony, Rajendra Nagar, Mayur Vihar Phase 1, Ashok Vihar, Rohini and Mukherjee Nagar and GTB Nagar, among others — collectively sent their recommendations to the CM.“Odd-Even for cars and two-wheelers with no exemptions should be announced to discourage movement of people and to give equal opportunity of vocation for all. The same should be introduced for taxis and auto-rickshaws as well. Alternate shops may be allowed in designated markets to open on alternate days. Coaching centres being invariably overcrowded should run only online classes. Construction activity in residential areas should not be allowed until the situation stabilises. Pan and gutka should be banned as people indulge in spitting in public spaces. Opening of restaurants, entertainment centres such as cinema halls, tourism, gyms, spas and salons should not be allowed,” read some of the suggestions given by this group. A group of lawyers sent had suggestions to decongest the sub-registrar offices across the Capital. “To prevent overcrowding in sub-registrar offices, public dealing timings (existing 10am to 2pm) can be increased by two hours minimum with only one appointment slot every five minutes (i.e the approximate time required for process of one document) instead of present four appointment slots every eight minutes,” the mail by an advocate, Gaurav Gambhir, read. It also suggested more counters at these offices and a separate counter for the registration of wills for senior citizens.BS Vohra, president, East Delhi RWAs Joint Front, suggested that the government stop the sale of liquor in stores. “Online orders, digital payments, and home delivery mechanisms must be applied here too, else they will not only be contributing to the economy but also to the spread of coronavirus in the city, in a greater way. Please don’t be in a hurry to open anything and everything May 18 onwards. As per noted doctors, the Covid situation is likely to worsen in the coming days. Therefore, Delhi Government must plan for gradual relaxations only, else it will be solely responsible if the situation worsens in the city,” read Vohra’s mail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-cm-gets-over-500-000-suggestions-for-a-post-lockdown-capital/story-mLo8pLIHfGRTrFSCxrVueP.html

14-05-2020||Delhi||To open shops or not — city traders divided on future after lockdown||After almost two of months closure, Delhi’s traders appear to be divided on reopening of markets after May 17 -- when the third leg of the nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of Covid-19 comes to an end.A section of traders want markets to remain shut till the end of May, keeping in mind the rising number of Covid-19 cases in the city. But others say there is an urgent need to revive economic activity in the city, citing loss of business and migrant labourers being forced to return home.A total of 359 new Covid-19 cases were reported in the Capital on Wednesday taking the tally to 7,998.Some associations want the government to opt for the odd-even formula — taking a cue from the road-rationing scheme used by the Delhi government to restrict the movement of vehicles during peak pollution season — in big markets. Others suggest fixed days or duration for each market to open to ensure effective crowd management and social distancing.All these measures were discussed at an online meeting called by the Chamber of Trade and Industry (CTI) on Wednesday. There are nearly one million traders in Delhi and over two million people employed with them, the association said.The Delhi government had till Wednesday — a day after Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal sought suggestions from public regarding relaxation in lockdown norms after May 17— had received over 5.48 lakh responses. Brijesh Goyal, national convener of CTI, said, “A majority of traders’ associations in the Capital want the government to reopen markets. Most associations, especially in big markets, suggested the odd-even formula to be implemented. They all know that they will do very little business for the next 10-15 days, but at least they can inspect the condition of their goods and clean their shops, which have remained shut for almost two months.”Some traders’ associations, such as those in Khan Market, have already prepared a plan to ensure social distancing once the market opens.The Khan Market Traders Association plans to only allow two entry points (front and back), install a sanitisation tunnel, thermal screening, a ban on parking inside for customers, and sanitisers at all shops.Sanjiv Mehra, president of the Khan Market Traders Association, said, “Now that we have to learn to live with it (Covid-19), these measures are needed. Those visiting our market understand the need for social distancing. Apart from screening visitors, only those who have the Aarogya Setu mobile application will be allowed to enter the market. These measures are need of the hour, as businesses have suffered a lot.”But there are some associations — such as the New Delhi Traders’ Association in Connaught Place and Chandni Chowk Sarv Vyapar Mandal — that want to wait for some more time before reopening markets as the number of cases were increasing every day. The two organisations are of the view that the markets should stay shut for another 10-15 days, at least.Sanjay Bhargava, president of Chandni Chowk Sarv Vyapar Mandal, said, “Our market is close to a containment area and with the number of Covid-19 cases on the rise, it better we wait for some more time.”Moreover, just opening markets will be of no use if public transport (buses and metro) is not operational, said Atul Bhargava, president of New Delhi Traders Association.“The operational cost is very high. There is no point in opening the shops if there are no customers. The public transport system has to be operational first so that customers and our staff can come without any inconvenience,” said Bhargava.Those in the wholesale business say that it is not economically viable to sustain their businesses and pay their employees. With migrant labourers going back to their home states, members of the Bhartiya Udyog Vyapar Mandal in Delhi said it will become “impossible to restart businesses if the labour is gone”.“Our businesses are dependent on labourers for loading, unloading and transportation. If people leave the city, it will become impossible for us to restart. While industrial units are operational, those who provide raw material to them are not allowed to operate. It is important to start all economic activities,” said Pradeep Gupta, general secretary of Bhartiya Udyog Vyapar Mandal .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/to-open-shops-or-not-city-traders-divided-on-future-after-lockdown/story-iRO5TvVuba5DseeXGkGiJK.html
14-05-2020||Delhi||Three more special trains ferry 3,500 to Bihar||Three more special trains ferrying around 3,500 stranded migrant workers left the Capital on Wednesday for Bihar’s Bhagalpur, Darbhanga and Barauni districts from the Old Delhi Railway Station.Five trains have left Delhi so far—one for Madhya Pradesh and four for Bihar—with around 6,000 stranded migrant workers as part of a special arrangement between the states under guidelines issued by the union home ministry on April 29.All 6,000 migrants who have so far left Delhi had taken shelter in government-run camps set up after the implementation of the nationwide lockdown on March 25, a senior government official said. There are at least 10,000 more stranded migrants from Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Odisha, West Bengal and Jharkhand in Delhi.Government officials said a large number of migrants, however, had chosen to stay back after witnessing the scaling down of lockdown norms and the partial revival of business and commercial activities in several sectors, including industries and construction, since last week.Over 300 state-run buses ferrying stranded migrants queued up outside the Old Delhi Railway Station on Wednesday afternoon. Ready with luggage, home-cooked food packed in layers of cloth, bottles of water and packets of dry snacks, scores of migrant workers waited inside designated circles marked for each of them to maintain distance at the entry to the station. Despite economic activities gradually opening up in different sectors, several of them said that they may return to Delhi after their workplaces reopen, but they needed to go home for now. Most said they wanted a break from the uncertain circumstances in the city. Rajendra Kumar, 36, said he had come to Delhi in early March to work at a cloth factory in Okhla, but could not wait to return home, where his old parents were waiting for them. While his wife wiped their two children’s faces with a wet cloth to try and save them from the heat, Kumar said he did not know when his factory would reopen. “The last two months have been really difficult to survive. My parents too don’t have much to survive on. We have a patch of land at home. I will farm it until things return to normal,” Kumar, who is from Munger, said. Vinod Kumar (49) and his son, labourers at a bag-making factory in Paharganj, said returning to their village would be a relief. “At least back in the village, there is no fear of people getting infected. We need a break from the prison-like life here. There is no option but to come back. But for some days, we will breathe without fear,” Kumar said. A group of labourers from Sadar Bazar, one of the biggest wholesale markets in Delhi, said their employer told them that he cannot pay their salaries and will call them back once the market reopens. “The owner told us he won’t be able to pay us our salaries for April. I don’t know how soon we will be able to go back. I will do some work at home to survive for a while,” said Sanjay Kumar Singh, 39, who worked at a toy factory here. Besides migrant workers, the trains also ferried a few students and out-of-work employees of private firms, who were stuck in rented accommodations. Delhi labour minister Gopal Rai said all migrants who left in the trains were screened. “They were provided with adequate food and water. The Delhi government paid for their tickets,” Rai said. Under the scheme meant for movement of stranded migrants, the central government bears 85% of the ticket cost and the remaining 15% is to be borne by either the state of origin or destination state.FIRST ARRIVALS IN SEVEN WEEKSOn Wednesday, Delhi recorded arrivals after nearly seven weeks of train operations being suspended by the Indian Railways in the light of the spread of Covid-19. On Wednesday morning, Delhi recorded arrivals from Patna, Ahmedabad, Mumbai and Howrah, a senior government official said. For the convenience of passengers, the city government and the police arranged buses connecting the New Delhi Railway Station with district headquarters in all 11 revenue districts in the city, the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/three-more-special-trains-ferry-3-500-to-bihar/story-uJzBEzlcACIMeLKAAalB5M.html
14-05-2020||Delhi||Folk song performances, plays entertain and educate residents of New Delhi’s shelter homes||Belting out songs on the glories of freedom fighters involved in the 1857 struggle in Harbola style — a Bundelkhandi folk tradition — Hardayal Kushwaha and his team of artistes entertained 150 residents of a shelter home in Mahipalpur on a Sunday afternoon. With children looking on in awe, women clapping and some men humming along, the group performed Bundelkhandi and Rajasthani folk songs, as a part of the New Delhi district administration’s Manoratna Campaign, aimed at entertaining and educating residents of shelter homes.Many of the residents lost their livelihoods during the lockdown from March-end to contain Covid-19, because of which it is important to ensure their physical and mental well-being, said officials associated with the initiative.“Folk music and songs not only entertain people but also keep the listener mentally happy, which makes it more relevant in these hard times of the coronavirus pandemic. Other than Bundelkhandi, we also perform folk songs of other regions, including Rajasthani, Bhojpuri, Kumaoni and Garwali scores. We have also improvised folk songs to spread awareness about the Covid-19 among people living in shelter homes and quarantine centres,” said Kushwaha, a member of a 15-member professional folk artist group named Bargad.Kushwaha said that it was in the last week of April that the New Delhi district administration sought their help in “spreading awareness and entertaining people” living in shelter homes, quarantine facilities and residential neighbourhoods. “We are not charging for our performances as it is for the public welfare. It is our contribution for the greater good of the society in these testing times,” Kushwaha said. His troupe had performed across the country, including the capital, in the past.Kushwaha said that the group tells people to fight the pandemic with the same spirit and unity exhibited by the freedom fighters.Under the campaign, cultural activities such as street play on Covid-19, yoga sessions and motivational marches by volunteers are organised. Officials of the district administration have also composed a ‘Corona song’ that they sing every day to raise awareness.Tanvi Garg, district magistrate, New Delhi, said Covid-19 has created a multitude of issues and, disrupted the physical and mental well-being of the citizens, prompting them to start the initiative. “The initiative aims at spreading positivity and happiness in this hour of crisis through numerous activities, ranging from organising yoga sessions to cultural activities in shelter homes on a regular basis. The response has been encouraging, especially to the musical performances of a variety of folk songs, in which the residents actively participated and enjoyed the performances while maintaining social distance. We are looking forward to having similar activities until all residents are safely sent back to their home towns,” Garg said.The New Delhi district has seven shelter homes, where around 850 migrants who could not return to their home towns due to nationwide lockdown, are living. These shelter homes are located in Mahipalpur, RK Puram, Kendriya Vidhyalaya Naraina, Delhi Cantonment and Gole Market, besides a quarantine centre in Pusa Institute, which has 40 residents.At present, there 352 Covid-19 positive cases and four containment zones — Pillanji Village, Israel Camp Rangpuri, EA Block and Budh Vihar in Inderpuri — in the district.Nitin Shakya, the district’s coronavirus nodal officer, who is also supervising the Manoratna Campaign, said that besides folk songs, yoga sessions and physical training sessions are also being held at the shelter homes.“Yoga not only gives physical strength, but also helps in clearing the mind. Currently, we are imparting yoga sessions to inmates with the help of civil defence volunteers and NGOs. We will soon rope in professional yoga trainers to conduct exercises on a regular basis and in a better manner. We have also prepared a Covid-19 song, which is sung by the civil servants of New Delhi DM office at all the shelter homes and quarantine facility every day to make people aware of the virus and safeguard them,” Shakya said.Shakya said that besides entertaining residents, they are also informing them of the ‘dos and dont’s’ during the pandemic through such exercises. Plays, about the virus and precautions to be taken to control its spread, are being performed every day, said officials, adding that people are told about the right way to wash hands, importance of maintain social distancing, use of masks and gloves, and to cover their mouth with a cloth while coughing or sneezing.Residents of the shelter homes welcomed the move, saying the programmes help them maintain a good spirit as well as provide a better understanding of Covid-19.“Music makes us feel good. Through such activities, we remain occupied for a good part of the day and don’t feel that we have been left alone or stranded hundreds of kilometres away from homes. Not only this, but we are also told about coronavirus disease, its symptoms and preventions through folk music, street plays and general counselling,” Satyendra Tiwari, a resident of the Mahipalpur shelter home said. He used to work at a restaurant in the city but could not return his home town of Mughalsarai in Uttar Pradesh, due to lockdown. Mukesh Kumar, a resident of the Gole Market shelter home, also a migrant from UP, said the initiatives help them pass the time and remain “mentally fit.”“If anyone is confined to a building for a long time, the person will start becoming mentally distressed. But activities like folk songs, music, yoga and plays on coronavirus help us in being positive and happy. It is a good time pass. Man laga rahta hai (We remain mentally occupied),” Kumar said.Nimesh Desai, the director of the Institute of Human Behaviour and Allied Science (IHBAS), said that such initiatives are necessary for the mental and physical well-being of occupants of shelter homes, amid the lockdown. IHBAS has been working closely with the government to assess the mental fitness of people living in shelter homes during the lockdown.“These promotive programmes help in boosting the morale of occupants of shelter homes. Such traditional methods (folk songs and music) will register better results, in terms of keeping them mentally fit and happy. Such efforts would not only cheer them up but also support them in maintaining their resilience,” Desai said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/folk-song-performances-plays-entertain-and-educate-residents-of-new-delhi-s-shelter-homes/story-yt6irD4mG5DXguYSfs40xJ.html
14-05-2020||Delhi||Plea in Delhi HC seeks resumption of public transport||The Delhi High Court on Wednesday sought the responses of the central and Delhi governments on a plea seeking resumption of the public transport services in the city. Most public transport has been suspended since the lockdown on March 25 although some services ran to ferry only those in essential services. During the third phase of the lockdown that began on May 4 and is scheduled to end on May 17, the central government had allowed considerable relaxations. This included allowing government and private offices but with only a third of its workforce. However, much of the public transport system remained suspended forcing people to take to private vehicles and creating traffic snarls in many parts of the city.A bench of Justice Rajiv Sahai Endlaw and Justice Sangita Dhingra Sehgal issued notices to the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Delhi government on the plea by law student Shreesh Chadha who also sought directions to frame guidelines for ensuring the safety and hygiene of the passengers while commuting.The plea was filed through advocate Prashant Vaxish. It sought that the public transport be resumed while mandating social distancing norms.Vaxish pointed out that data from the Supreme Court-appointed pollution monitoring committee Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority [EPCA], about 2.5 million people use the Delhi Transport Corporation buses every day. Similarly, the Delhi Metro records a ridership of 1.5 million daily. The counsel used these numbers to argue that the public heavily depended on public transport, in the absence of which they are left in the lurch.He highlighted that people were suffering losses for not being able to attend their offices due to this.The counsels for both the Centre and the Delhi government accepted the notice following which the court posted the matter for May 20.Meanwhile, an impleadment application was also filed in the matter by advocate Karan Mathur, who had filed a writ stating that the caretakers for the disabled persons are not being able to come because the transport is not working.“My petition was disposed of as the Centre listed out the steps it had taken. However, since one of the grievances regarding the public transport was not resolved, I moved an impleadment in the matter to be heard as the party. The court has accepted my request,” Mathur said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/plea-in-delhi-hc-seeks-resumption-of-public-transport/story-K5qYKNeiT6R5FpgjenioiO.html

To add to their woes, the rent and electricity bills of the house they live in Ghanupur Kale area of the city are piling up.“I earned Rs 600-700 daily, of which I would pay Rs 300 as rent of the auto-rickshaw,” said Iqbal.The couple’s daughter was married off four years ago while their son migrated to Saudi Arabia in 2017 to work there as a labourer. “Our son is stuck there and has not sent a single rupee to us in the last three years,” he said.Iqbal is not the only one whose life got turned upside down since the lockdown was announced to check the spread of the coronavirus. Like him, there are nearly 65,000 auto-rickshaw drivers in Amritsar district who are struggling to eke out a living. Lakhs of tourists visit the city daily, a key source of income for the auto-rickshaw drivers.Ram Sharanpal, president, Amritsar School Vans and Auto-rickshaw Welfare Association, says around 2.5 lakh people are dependent on the business. “I am getting calls daily as some of them are on the brink of starvation,” he said.Some auto-rickshaw drivers have started selling vegetables and fruits while others are working as labourers in the grain markets.“Our livelihoods have been destroyed by the pandemic. We do not see any hope. We will not see any tourist here for at least one year,” says Joginder Singh (52), a rickshaw driver who lives in Putlighar locality.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/families-of-65-000-auto-drivers-in-amritsar-struggling-to-make-ends-meet/story-W0pw784JAvkk8sIIEAsFyN.html

14-05-2020||Pune||Canine lovers in Pune come together to feed stray dogs||Canine lovers in the city believe that the relaxation of lockdown norms has enabled residents to ensure stray dogs in their areas do not go hungry.Anisha Rao, from NIBM road, said, “It is still tough to feed stray dogs as some areas are containment zones and we are not permitted to visit these areas. We are hopeful that the situation eases further and the lockdown is lifted.”Aletha Tavares, an animal rights activist, said that as soon as the curfew was announced many of the volunteers were unsure what to do. “Volunteers feed as many as five to 40 dogs a day. Some feed kibble (dry food), some cook rice and chicken and rice and milk. The first few days were tough as volunteers were uncertain about timings, but when the animal welfare board came out with basic rules about feeding, it helped. In the beginning there was dearth of dry food. Stray dogs usually depend on leftovers from eateries for food, but they were shut. Volunteers rallied and took up the challenge to go that extra mile to feed dogs,” she said.Tavares said that NGOs like Karma foundation and ResQ were also delivering food packets to volunteers. “Recipes too were shared during this time to help volunteers feed dogs who were not used to dry food. Although, in general, people have been kind to animals, there are a few who don’t allow water containers to be kept for animals given the scorching heat. Despite these odds, volunteers have braved all this with the kindness and support of police,” Tavares said.Michele Bhise, also an animal rights activist, said, “A number of feeders are there to feed the dogs, which is a good sign,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/coming-together-to-feed-stray-dogs/story-qt0Cx3XPmtsBjs1LpIdYPP.html

14-05-2020||Pune||With new discharge protocol, PMC rethinks over creating more isolation centres in Pune||Pune: With the new discharge protocol of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) coming into effect nationally, Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) is reviewing its decision to expand the isolation facilities it had proposed earlier.Be it the upcoming 10,000-bed capacity at Balewadi sports complex or the Wipro office at Hinjewadi that was proposed to be turned into a capacity of 450 beds, the civic body has decided to review it as the new protocol seeks early discharge of covid positive person. As per the new protocol, a person showing mild and moderate symptoms needs to be discharged in 10 days without a second test. This, as PMC commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad stated earlier and reported by Hindustan Times, will make more beds available to admit new patients. Despite doubling rate reducing the PMC’s decision on not increasing isolation facility may create problems if there is a sudden spurt in cases, warn experts. “We are revisiting the decision to create more new quarantine or isolation centres like the facility at Balewadi sports complex or the recent Wipro IT office at Hinjewadi. With the next ICMR protocols, we have about 500 beds immediately available for new patients so we will review the situation and take a call accordingly. It is a mammoth task to organise for 10,000 beds, food facilities and toiletries. Logistics is another added work. We also need money to do all this. So, for now, we will wait and take a call accordingly,” Gaikwad said. A civic official said the isolation centre planned at Balewadi sports complex would have been the largest centre in the city.The proposed Wipro facility at Hinjewadi was to be developed by the IT firm which will provide beds and oxygen supply units for 12 out of the 450 beds, only after the PMC expresses the need. “Work at the office campus is yet to start since the PMC is reviewing its need for the facility,” said Gaikwad. As per the state report from the public health department, there are also 1,863 beds in the dedicated covid hospital (DCH), 1,751 isolation beds at dedicated covid health centre (DCHC) and 6,067 beds at the dedicated covid care centre (DCCC).As per the report, Pune reports a 13.8% utilisation of DCH ICU beds, 5.5% utilisation of DCHC hospital ICU beds. In terms of utilisation of ventilators, Pune has maximum utilisation in the state out of the 14 districts in the dedicated hospitals. As of May 9, 45 ventilators were occupied out of 93 ventilators available for Covid-19 which is 48.4% while in the case of DCHC ventilators, out of 72, 15 are occupied which is 20.8% ventilators. Despite a less utilisation of available beds in the city, PMC is hoping to get more beds by discharging current patients following the new protocol by ICMR. Doctors in the city say that even if they would want to hold back the patients there is no use as National Institute of Virology (NIV) refuses to test the swab in case of a follow-up case. Dr Vijay Natarajan, chief executive officer (CEO) of Symbiosis University Hospital which is a nodal Covid-19 facility, said, “We have to discharge the patients as per the protocol and even after 14th day, NIV is not retesting their sample. We have had patients who tested positive even on the 15 or sometimes 20th day too. Any infected person who is positive irrespective of the viral load in his body is more likely to infect more people. A single person can infect around 4-5 people and could multiply cases. Hence, if the civic body starts discharging patients to save a single bed, it may cause a spurt in the number of cases and could fill four to five more beds in future. No matter what but complete self-quarantine is next to impossible in a typical middle-class family in India.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/with-new-icmr-protocol-pmc-rethinks-over-creating-more-isolation-centres/story-2bij128f95XYrSlKFHGshP.html

We have kept a track of labour applications. We have received around 15,000 applications from labourers along with a medical certificate,” said DCP Gaikwad.The notices were meant to warn contractors against abandoning labourers who have worked for them, said DCP Gaikwad.The detection branch officials of police stations have been appointed to keep in touch with contractors and labourers.“The contractors know the people whom they employ. We have served notices to around 20-25 of them. To ensure that they do not abandon them or run away, officials of the detection branch which is most active on the ground are appointed. In the beginning, they were made to visit areas like janata vasahat where labourers are known to stay and keep a track of their number,” said senior inspector Devidas Ghevare of Dattawadi police station.“Wherever there are labour camps, we served notices to some 12 labour contractors who were responsible for them to arrange for basic necessities for them. We did it when the central government had announced their decision asking states to arrange for migrant workers’ movement back home,” said senior inspector Nankumar Shelker of Sinhgad road police station.The labour contractors are the source providing labourers to construction sites and a link between builders and labourers.

14-05-2020||Pune||From agony to hope: Homebound migrant workers on foot find solace at makeshift shelters in Pune district||Soar feet, body pain, no food or money and dealing with the needs of other family members has proved to be a challenging situation for migrant labourers who have been on the road during the lockdown trying to get back to their hometowns on foot.However, for workers walking through Pune district, makeshift relief camps at wedding halls, community centres and roadside eateries has provided the much-needed relief to those who have been the worst hit by the lockdown.After having walked around 30 kilometres, Rasia Saad, a mother of four, including a six-month-old child, arrived at relief camp in Chandoli on Pune-Nashik road, she was more than surprised. Her experience was far different than what she had thought.The makeshift camp at a marriage hall in Chandoli near Khed is among 39 such centres that the district administration has set up with the help of local gram panchayats. These camps have so far offered temporary shelter to at least 10,000 migrant workers walking on the highways to their hometowns before they are dispatched to nearby the bus depot or railway station to take them to their destination. “We were walking down the road when people here took us to this camp where we are getting food, milk for children and bus service is also being arranged to get us back to our state,” said Saad, a labourer from Chhattisgarh engaged at a local industrial estate, who came along with group of 10 people. Saad had undertaken this journey back home on foot after the lockdown was extended, when a local NGO brought her and the children to this camp. Most of these relief camps have been set up at roadside hotels and wedding halls or community centres on highways leading to Pune. “In all these 39 camps, facilities such as water, toilets, food, basic medical care, and check-up for flu-like symptoms are being offered,” said Sambhaji Langore, project director, district rural development scheme. The camps, according to district collector Naval Kishore Ram, have been set up under the district contingency fund and money will be paid to gram panchayats for erecting these camps. “So far, we have given food and other things to over 4,000 people. We have also made arrangements of buses till the Pune railway station from where they can board trains to their destinations,” said Mayur Ugle, development officer, Chandoli. Most of the migrants who are offered brief shelter at these camps are from Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Uttar Pradesh. These migrants were working mostly in industries and at construction sites, which stopped functioning during the lockdown, rendering them jobless. “We have now made arrangement of buses from our camp to the Pune railway station where a train has been arranged for MP. In these efforts, we are getting help from local youths and NGOs,” said Ugle. To most workers, the camps are offering masks and soaps to maintain cleanliness. “Before subjecting us to medical screening, people at this camp offered us soap and masks,” said Lala Bajpai, a migrant from MP, who had taken halt at another camp set up at Sitabai Thite school in Shirur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/from-agony-to-hope-homebound-migrant-workers-on-foot-find-solace-at-makeshift-shelters-in-pune-district/story-6rr0b18rDP63rIqOB1JSRP.html

Pathak has the support of his wife and family members despite the health concerns involved in visiting the containment zone areas.“I have been to the Meenatai Thackeray slum in Maharshinagar area and the Taljai slum. We have carried out door-to-door screenings and have also given medicines prescribed by the doctors’ team that goes along with us. Many young women have also participated in the cause and are staying with us at the Garware College quarantine centre,” he said.Pathak and the group of volunteers were first given a briefing by PMC health team and trained on how to wear the PPE kit. After completing a three-day duty, they are required to take a break and spend the next three days in isolation at the Garware College quarantine centre. They are tested on the seventh day for Covid-19 and allowed to go home if the test is negative.Many doctors are in quarantine with him. “Although the work has its risks, we feel we are participating in a noble cause,” he said.Cardiologist Dr Rajendra Patil and Ayurvedic physician Dr Maya Golikere said they were part of the Covid-19 screening team at the Tadiwala road slum where 450 people were screened and 10 people suspected of being infected with the Covid-19 disease sent for testing. “People in red zone areas are frightened and are themselves coming forward for screening,” said Patil.Tukaram Naik, who is heading the Jankalyan Samiti which is providing volunteers to PMC for house-to-house screening, said that although the civic body is providing mobile clinics in red zone areas in Pune, it had been facing manpower shortage. “Additional municipal commissioner Rubal Agarwal appealed for assistance in the screening work and that’s how we organised volunteers for this work,” he said.Agarwal said, “Apart from the government machinery, many other organisations and corporates have been helping the civic body in the fight against Covid-19. We received mobile ambulances from a private organisation. RSS volunteers are working with mobile clinics for screening. Many small and big organisations have come forward and joined hands with the civic body and are trying to help in their capacity.”Distribution of food packets and ration kits across MaharashtraOn another front, the RSS Jankalyan Samiti said that as of May 10 it had distributed 1.32 lakh ration kits and 61 lakh food packets to needy families across Maharashtra. This was besides carrying out 22,747 health and sanitation-related works and blood donation drives.RSS Jankalyan Samiti Pune head Tukaram Naik said volunteers were working with government organisations to help the needy. They are support by other organisations as well, such as Mumbai’s Dabbawalas (tiffin carriers) and Pune’s ISKCON (International society for Krishna consciousness) who were providing food packets, he said.Food was provided to truck drivers and cleaners stranded on highways, migrant labourers, senior citizens and poor people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/25-year-old-is-part-of-covid-19-house-to-house-survey-team-of-rss-volunteers/story-K96jgRx5tdxxBKaF837v1M.html
14-05-2020||Chandigarh||HT Salutes: Haven’t taken a single day off since lockdown, says nodal officer Gaurav Gaur||Panjab University (PU) assistant professor Gaurav Gaur, 36, has constantly been on the go ever since he volunteered to be the nodal officer for Sectors 30 and 27.It was on March 26 that the Chandigarh administration gave Gaur the charge of Sector 30. Since then Gaur hasn’t taken a single day off. In fact, he also volunteered to be the nodal officer for Sector 27.“Our team has been working without break since the lockdown was imposed. It is hardly time to keep track of our calendars and watches. This is the time to serve society,” Gaur said.Nowadays, from 7am to 7.30pm, one can find Guar facilitating essential services in the two sectors. His day begins with feeding stray dogs in Sector 25 and ends with distributing essentials among the needy.Gaur’s task wasn’t without difficulties. “When I was given charge of Sector 30, it was an affected pocket and anxiety was running high among residents. Now, things have settled.”Guar, who has been a social worker for decades, has been particularly focused on ensuring the wellbeing of the elderly. Guar says, “We called all senior citizens in the area to make sure that they were not facing any problem during the lockdown.”Gaur’s car is stuffed with an assortment of dog feed, biscuits, sanitary napkins, ration, and face masks, which he distributes among the needy.He also accompanyies buses supplying fruits and vegetables and taking mobile ATM vans to resident’s doorsteps.“We get calls from the different areas of the city and have provided help to almost all people who have approached us. We also made sure that the transgender community wasn’t overlooked,” he said.Gaur is a part of a number of welfare projects such as door-to-door distribution of sanitary napkins in Mohali, looking after migrant labourers on the PU campus and feeding cows at the cow shelter in Sector 25.Gaur, along with few other PU teachers, have formed a network, which is providing essential services such as ration, milk, fruits and vegetables to construction workers, elderly and those staying alone on the university campus.Notably, in 2011, Gaur was awarded the United Nations Volunteers, International Confederation of NGOs (UNV-iCongo) Karmaveer Chakra Awardfor raising awareness about HIV-AIDS. In 2009, Guar was honoured by Queen Elizabeth II at the Buckingham Palace.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ht-salutes-haven-t-taken-a-single-day-off-since-lockdown-says-nodal-officer-gaurav-gaur/story-Mrl50g4GZKXpW7tZdVIFAL.html
14-05-2020||World||Some US schools are pulling the plug on distance learning||After the Chattahoochee County school district called an early end to the school year, seniors lined up one day last week to complete their graduation paperwork. Students who hadn’t seen each other since in-person classes ended abruptly in March amid the coronavirus outbreak commiserated over all they’ve missed out on, including the prom and a senior class trip.Some also wondered about what they may have lost academically.“Honestly, remote learning, I don’t think was my favorite thing,” said 18-year-old Isabella Branson. “It’s kind of hard to stay motivated when you don’t have anything to look forward to and you don’t see your friends.”The small district in rural Georgia is among many around the U.S. that have pulled the plug on distance learning, all citing familiar reasons. It’s too stressful, the lack of devices and internet access is too much to overcome, and what students get from it just isn’t worth the struggle.In Georgia, where the school year is ending early for one of every 10 students, many district leaders say the final weeks of the school year would have been dedicated anyway to preparing for and taking standardized tests that are now canceled. The governor and state schools superintendent who have moved to dismantle parts of Georgia’s high-stakes testing system have said they are not opposed to fewer instructional days.“We didn’t cut any class time out,” Chattahoochee County High School Principal Josh Kemp said. “There was no reason to pile more on our parents and students.”But Kemp and others also acknowledge that there was material that wasn’t covered and that teachers will have to find a way to fold it in next year for returning students.“They weren’t able to get all the standards,” said Tammy Bailey, the science department chair at the high school. “I think there will be a gap.”Classes had been scheduled to run through May 21 but remote instruction instead came to an end May 8 in the Chattahoochee County school district. A majority of the high school’s 450 students live on the U.S. Army’s sprawling Fort Benning, while a minority live around the small town of Cusseta. Only 59% of households in the district have access to broadband internet at home.Other districts around the country that are ending the school year early including Omaha and some nearby suburban districts in Nebraska, Washington, D.C., and some in New Hampshire. Officials say they want to relieve stress on families, ease problems for students without internet access, and focus on preparing for a fresh start in the fall.The last three weeks of school is “probably not prime instructional time,” said Andrew McEachin, an education policy researcher at RAND Corp. But he said that kids in struggling households may suffer most from being cut off from the normalcy of a school routine.“I think the biggest thing about cutting a school year short is not what it does on average, but what it does on equity,” McEachin said. “Even if school isn’t working as well as we want it to be, that may be the best access low income students have to learning.”Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, said on April 16 that he trusted schools to set their calendars and the following day, state Superintendent Richard Woods wrote that schools’ focus during the pandemic should “not be on test scores” but on making sure children are “healthy, safe and nurtured.”But Michael O’Sullivan, executive director of GeorgiaCAN, a group that supports Georgia’s testing system, says this spring has been a preview of a “zero-accountability world.”“It’s the easy way out of a very difficult situation, but that doesn’t mean it’s going to be good for kids,” O’Sullivan said.Some schools in Georgia are making plans to combat academic losses from the year, such as beefed-up summer sessions. The Scintilla Charter Academy in Valdosta is aiming to start the next school year on July 23, to make up the time it lost when it ended on April 30.Scintilla Dean of School Mandy Avera said her families were “stressed and overwhelmed” by online learning. The school covers kindergarten through sixth grade, and Avera is among educators who question whether younger children can successfully acquire critical skills like learning to read without a face-to-face interaction with a teacher.“It just created a situation where we just can’t be as interactive as we like to be at Scintilla,” Avera said. “Kindergartners don’t understand why they’re at home. They don’t understand why they can’t go back to school and see their friends and see their teachers.”Back in Cusseta, some seniors were stressing about being able to bring only four guests to a socially-distant graduation ceremony, while others were disregarding imposed distance to hug and gossip. But Chattahoochee County Superintendent Kristi Brooks was already trying to think about the next school year, despite uncertainty on whether in-person classes will resume.“They’re going to have missed 60 days of instruction,” Brooks said “When we come back for the fall, we’re going to have to pick up in some basic areas.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/some-us-schools-are-pulling-the-plug-on-distance-learning/story-WT4hG6HOk1jTLhHibWVkNP.html
14-05-2020||World||Benjamin Netanyahu delays swearing-in of unity government until Sunday over infighting||The swearing-in of a new Israeli government led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was postponed at the last moment on Thursday by three days in the wake of growing discontent within his Likud party over distribution of ministerial portfolios.A joint statement by Netanyahu and his coalition partner, Benny Gantz of the Blue and White party, said that the two sides have agreed to postpone the swearing-in to Sunday.Gantz initially insisted that the swearing-in will go ahead as planned earlier Thursday evening, but later relented to Netanyahu’s request under the condition that he would withdraw his resignation as the Speaker of the Knesset (Israeli Parliament).Knesset’s spokesperson confirmed the withdrawal request by Gantz.Senior Likud leader and Regional Cooperation Minister Tzachi Hanegbi and Deputy Defence Minister Avi Dichter announced that they would boycott the vote of confidence. “I guess I am not needed in the Knesset, so Shabbat Shalom”, Hanegbi wrote in social media.Miri Regev and Gila Gamliel, who have been offered ministries (transportation and higher education, respectively), are both reportedly unhappy too.The elevation of the relatively junior Likud lawmaker (and current acting Justice Minister) Amir Ohana to minister of public security is said to have infuriated several senior leaders in the Likud party.Despite being the largest government in Israel’s history, Netanyahu’s proposed jumbo cabinet of 36 ministers and 16 deputy ministers has failed to satisfy people within his own ruling Likud party and also his natural coalition partners who stood by him during the last 18 months of political uncertainty.The swearing-in of a new government will bring an end to the longest political deadlock in the country’s history which saw a caretaker government in charge for over 500 days and three back-to-back general elections with no clear verdict.Netanyahu, 70, formally made the announcement that he had succeeded in forming a government on Wednesday in letters sent to President Reuven Rivlin and Blue and White party Chairman Gantz, who is temporarily serving as the Knesset’s (Israeli Parliament) speaker.The new government, which according to the coalition agreement, will see Gantz replace Netanyahu as Prime Minister after 18 months, was scheduled to be sworn in on Thursday evening.Gantz will serve as Defense Minister until he is scheduled to take over as the Prime Minister on November 14, 2021. He will till then have the title of ‘Alternate Prime Minister’, something that Netanyahu will take over from him after exchanging the baton.Prominent ministerial appointments likely are Gabi Ashkenazi (Blue and White party) as foreign minister, Israel Katz (Likud) as finance minister, Avi Nissenkorn (Blue and White party) as Justice minister and Likud Yuli Edelstein (Likud) as health minister.During his tenure as justice minister, Ohana repeatedly attacked the judiciary and those leading it as they pushed forward with criminal investigations, and eventually indictments, against Netanyahu. The Israeli Prime Minister has denied any wrongdoing. His trial is set to start later this month.Ohana’s possible appointment as public security minister had sparked speculation among top police officials that he may seek an outside candidate to lead the force, curtail its Lahav 433 investigation unit, and oppose possible new probes into Netanyahu.The beleaguered Israeli Prime Minister, who surpassed Israel’s first Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion’s record of the longest-serving Premier in the country’s history last year in July, managed to hold on to his right-wing bloc amid three inconclusive polls to force his main rival Gantz to finally succumb to the demand of a broad national unity government.Gantz campaigned on replacing Netanyahu due to the Prime Minister’s indictment on graft charges, but dropped his opposition to sitting in a government with him after the latest elections again ended with no clear winner, citing the coronavirus pandemic and a desire to avoid a fourth round of voting. The move led to the breakup of the Blue and White alliance, with Gantz being elected as Knesset speaker with the backing of Netanyahu’s right-wing religious bloc as they negotiated the terms of the new government. The Likud and Blue and White on Wednesday evening released the policy principles of the new government, as instructed by Israel’s Supreme Court.The document said that the government will initially form an emergency cabinet to deal with the coronavirus pandemic and formulate a plan to bring Israel out of the accompanying economic crisis while rolling out a “socioeconomic safety net” and special programmes for citizens who are struggling financially.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/benjamin-netanyahu-delays-swearing-in-of-unity-government-until-sunday-over-infighting/story-6p4gGOdfjxIxGEeI1Uh7UL.html
14-05-2020||World||US accuses China of trying to hack and steal Covid-19 research||The United States has accused China of unleashing its hackers on American research organizations and pharmaceutical companies working on Covid-19 treatments and vaccines. “These actors have been observed attempting to identify and illicitly obtain valuable intellectual property (IP) and public health data related to vaccines, treatments, and testing from networks and personnel affiliated with COVID-19-related research,” the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) of the Department of Homeland Security, said in a rare joint alert issued Wednesday.“China’s efforts to target these sectors pose a significant threat to our nation’s response to COVID-19,” it added, identifying healthcare, pharmaceutical and research sectors as at risk. The alert also did not identify targeted organizations or describe how the hacking was discovered.These accusation will further escalate tensions between the two countries on over the Covid-19 pandemic. The US has accused China of not alerting the world early enough about the epidemic, which started in Wuhan last December, and not being transparent about its start and the exact magnitude infections and fatalities.News reports suggested some officials in the Trump administration were inclined to view this attempt as a threat to national security as they may have even hindered the ongoing research. No evidence was cited, once again.CISA had issued a joint alert along with the United Kingdom’s National Security Agency in April warning about advanced persistent threat (APT) groups of targeting organizations engaged in local and international response to Covid-19.They had not identified China or any other entity, but said healthcare bodies, pharmaceutical companies, academia, medical research organizations, and local governments.“APT actors frequently target organizations in order to collect bulk personal information, intellectual property, and intelligence that aligns with national priorities,” it added added.The United States has long accused Chinese hackers of targeting companies, research institutions and universities and the theft of intellectual property has been a persistent source of tension between the two countries.US officials have also accused Iran of carrying out similar cyberattacks though the alert did not name it The Wall Street Journal said Iranian hackers have targeted Gilead Science, the maker of remdesivir, which was recently granted emergency-use authorization by the US drug regulator and which has generated excitement around world. hammered by a virus that has continued to defy cure or prevention.More than 90 separate efforts are under was in the United States to find a vaccine. The Trump administration has launched an ambitious Manhattan Project-style effort called “Operation Warp Speed” to expedite the hunt for the vaccine in a private-public partnership. It is reported to have narrowed down the search from an estimated 93 to 14, with plans to further pare it down to seven, and then to 3 or four for final clinical trials in January.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-accuses-china-of-trying-to-hack-and-steal-covid-19-research/story-72rrovMziDbRfw4FPb8aFJ.html
14-05-2020||World||Donald Trump attacks his top Covid-19 expert Anthony Fauci, squabbles with others||Three million more Americans filed for unemployment benefits, according to new data released Thursday as in his eagerness to arrest and reverse the economic downturn President Donald Trump has publicly squabbled with his top medical official’s assessment of the battle against the Covid-19 epidemic.The number of people left jobless by the eight-week long lockdown forced by the outbreak has now risen to 36.5 million.President Trump has been eager to end the lockdown to arrest the economic downturn and has sought to project a more optimistic view of the outbreak than experts and officials of his own task force, who have said the country is not out of the woods yet. He lashed out Anthony Fauci, the most vocal of these experts, accusing him of trying to “play all sides of the equation”.Trump’s ire was directed this time at Fauci’s testimony before at a us senate hearing Tuesday in which he, and other top public health officials, had offered a far less optimistic assessment of the state of the epidemic in the United States than the one repeatedly offered by the president in his eagerness to reopen the economy and lift restrictions on public life.Trump also attacked Rick Bright, a public health official who was sidelined for questioning he administration’s response and the president’s personal backing for the antimalarial hydroxychloroquine, Thursday ahead of a congressional hearing. Bright said early signs of the epidemic were missed and without proper planning and implementation of steps laid down by experts, “2020 will be darkest winter in modern history”In the past 24 hours, 1,763 people died of Covid-19 taking the US toll to 84,144 and the number of reported infections went up to 1.39 million with 21,030 new cases.“He wants to play all sides of the equation,” Trump told reporters when asked about Fauci’s testimony in which he had urged caution in reopening the economy, as he has consistently.Asked to explain what he meant, Trump said, “I was surprised -- I was surprised by his answer, actually, because, you know, it’s just -- to me, it’s not an acceptable answer, especially when it comes to schools.”Fauci had urged caution in reopening the economy and country and warned against rushing it into it, which he had said, could lead to “little spikes that might turn into outbreaks.” Both he and Robert Redfield, head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), had also argued the United States is not out of the woods yet.President Trump has been eager to reopen the economy and has been at odds with Fauci and other members of the task force he set up to spearhead his administration’s response to the epidemic, who have consistently urged caution.Until now, however, the president had refrained from publicly acknowledging these differences and expressed complete respect for faith in his experts. Bu he is said to have been privately fuming with Fauci, who does not shrink from publicly disagreeing with the president.But as the president kept his peace, until now, allies and supporters went after Fauci, accusing him of trying to impose his will on the president and the administration. Fox News anchors have led the charge questioning his credentials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-attacks-his-top-covid-19-expert-anthony-fauci-squabbles-with-others/story-f8dKD6w76MzZvajnx2rcgJ.html
14-05-2020||World||Barack Obama emerges as central figure in 2020 presidential race||Nearly eight years after he was last on the ballot, Barack Obama is emerging as a central figure in the 2020 presidential election.Democrats are eagerly embracing Obama as a political wingman for Joe Biden, who spent two terms by his side as vice president. Obama remains the party’s most popular figure, particularly with black voters and younger Democrats, and Biden’s presidential campaign is planning for him to have a highly visible role in the months to come.For President Donald Trump, that means an opportunity to focus the spotlight on one of his favorite political foils. In recent days, Trump and his allies have aggressively pushed conspiracy theories about Obama designed to fire up the president’s conservative base, taint Biden by association and distract from the glut of grim health and economic news from the coronavirus pandemic.“Partisans on both sides want to make this about Obama,” said Ned Price, who served as spokesperson for Obama’s White House National Security Council.The renewed political focus on Obama sets the stage for an election about the nation’s future that will also be about its past. As Biden looks to Obama for personal validation, he’s also running to restore some of the former president’s legacy, which has been systematically dismantled by Trump. The current president is running in part to finish that job.Yet Trump’s anti-Obama push also frequently takes on a darker, more conspiratorial tone that goes far beyond differences in health care policy and America’s role in the world. His current focus is on the actions Obama, Biden and their national security advisers took in the closing days of their administration, as they viewed intelligence reports about Michael Flynn. Flynn had a short-lived stint as Trump’s national security adviser before being fired for lying to Vice President Mike Pence about his interactions with Russia’s ambassador to the U.S.Trump’s own administration acknowledged on Wednesday that Obama advisers followed proper procedures in privately “unmasking” Flynn’s name, which was redacted in the intelligence reports for privacy reasons. Flynn ultimately pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI, though Trump’s Justice Department moved last week to drop the case against him.Despite there being no evidence of wrongdoing by Obama, Biden or other administration officials, Trump is eagerly pushing the notion of an unspecified crime against the former president, branding it “Obamagate.” He’s being backed up by Republican allies, including Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley who took to the Senate floor this week to ask of the Flynn matter: “What did Obama and Biden know, and when did they know it?”Trump’s zeal has sparked fears among some former Obama and Biden advisers about how far he may be willing to go in using the levers of government to push his case against them in an election year. The Justice Department is conducting an investigation into the origins of the Russia probe that ensnared Flynn and other Trump associates.Trump’s renewed focus on Obama comes as Republicans grow increasingly anxious that the rising coronavirus death toll and cratering economy will damage the president’s reelection prospects in November. More than 84,000 Americans have died from the virus, and more than 30 million have claimed unemployment.Biden’s campaign drew a direct connection between the president’s attacks on Obama and the twin crises battering his administration.“It’s no surprise that the president is erratically lashing out at President Obama, desperate to distract from his own failures as commander in chief that have cost thousands of Americans their lives during this crisis,” said TJ Ducklo, a Biden campaign spokesman.Trump’s emphasis on Obama also comes as the former president begins to emerge from a three-year period of political restraint as he prepares to embrace his role as leading surrogate for Biden. Last week, Obama told a large gathering of alumni from his administration that DOJ’s decision to drop the Flynn case put the “rule of law at risk.” He also criticized the Trump White House’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic.Biden’s campaign has been eager to get Obama involved in the election, though his exact role is still forming, particularly given that the pandemic has upended the campaign’s plans for rallies and other in-person events in battleground states. The former president is also expected to campaign for Democratic House and Senate candidates across the country.Though Obama campaigned for Democratic candidates in the 2018 midterms, he has mostly tried to avoid overt politics since leaving the White House. He’s spoken out publicly against Trump on rare occasions, frustrating many Democrats who have wanted him to be more aggressive in calling out his successor.But the 2020 election has always loomed as the moment when Obama would step off the sidelines, and he’s told advisers he’s eager to do so. Despite his strident public neutrality during the Democratic primary, he spoke to Biden regularly and has continued to do so as the campaign moves into the general election, according to aides.Biden’s campaign sees Obama as a clear asset as they seek to not only energize Democrats,but to also appeal to independents and more moderate Republicans who may be wary of four more years of Trump in the White House.A recent Monmouth University poll found 57% of Americans say they have a favorable opinion of Obama. That includes 92% of Democrats and 19% of Republicans.Obama’s favorable ratings are higher than either of the men who will be on the ballot in November. The same poll showed 41% of Americans had a favorable opinion of Biden, and 40% viewed Trump in a favorable light.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/barack-obama-emerges-as-central-figure-in-2020-presidential-race/story-xlNKHwFTNsbLdSmd3XC6jI.html
14-05-2020||World||WTO to make announcement about chief amid reports he will resign||The World Trade Organization will make an announcement Thursday about its Director-General Roberto Azevedo, a spokesman said, following reports he is planning to step down before his term expires next year.“The WTO will have an announcement on this matter following the heads of delegation meeting” at 1400 GMT, spokesman Keith Rockwell said in an email statement sent to AFP, adding that no further comment would be made before then.His comment came after Bloomberg reported that Azevedo had told governments he planned to step down before the end of his mandate, with the news agency suggesting he would leave on September 1.The 62-year-old Brazilian career diplomat first took the reins of the global trade body in 2013 and his second term is due to end in 2021.Several diplomats confirmed to AFP that they had been hastily called to take part in a meeting Thursday on “pressing administrative matters”.Azevedo’s possible early departure would come at a time when the COVID-19 pandemic has pushed the global economy and international trade into turmoil, suffering slowdowns not seen since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Global trade, already hit by trade tensions and uncertainties around Brexit, is expected to register “double-digit declines in trade volumes” in nearly all regions this year, the WTO said last month.The organisation was meanwhile already in crisis before the pandemic hit, amid raging trade wars and as the United States under President Donald Trump has pushed for dramatic reforms of the Geneva-based body.The WTO was, for instance, forced to put its dispute settlement appeal system on ice last December after Washington blocked the appointment of new judges, preventing it from reaching a three-judge quorum.Azevedo, who before his appointment as WTO chief spent five years as his country’s ambassador to the organisation, has enjoyed a reputation as a consensus-builder.During his first term he dedicated much energy to trying to unblock long-deadlocked trade agreements.In 2014 managed to help secure the Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA), in which nations agreed to simplify and standardise customs procedures at borders to make it easier for goods to flow around the world.But countries have since then failed to reach any further multilateral agreements, including on fisheries subsidies, and since 2017, the WTO has struggled to deal with a US administration openly hostile to its multilateral approach.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wto-to-make-announcement-about-chief-amid-reports-he-will-resign/story-qvhN6bIX1Eisswei7HgMzJ.html
14-05-2020||World||36 million have sought US unemployment aid since coronavirus hit||Nearly 3 million laid-off workers applied for U.S. unemployment benefits last week as the viral outbreak led more companies to slash jobs even though most states have begun to let some businesses reopen under certain restrictions.Roughly 36 million people have now filed for jobless aid in the two months since the coronavirus first forced millions of businesses to close their doors and shrink their workforces, the Labor Department said Thursday.Still, the number of first-time applications has now declined for six straight weeks, suggesting that a dwindling number of companies are reducing their payrolls.By historical standards, though, the latest tally shows that the number of weekly jobless claims remains enormous, reflecting an economy that is sinking into a severe downturn. Last week’s pace of new applications for aid is still four times the record high that prevailed before the coronavirus struck hard in March.Jobless workers in some states are still reporting difficulty applying for or receiving benefits. These include free-lance, gig and self-employed workers, who became newly eligible for jobless aid this year.The states that are now easing lockdowns are doing so in varied ways. Ohio has permitted warehouses, most offices, factories, and construction companies to reopen, but restaurants and bars remain closed for indoor sit-down service.A handful of states have gone further, including Georgia, which has opened barber shops, bowling alleys, tattoo parlors and gyms. South Carolina has reopened beach hotels, and Texas has reopened shopping malls.Data from private firms suggest that some previously laid-off workers have started to return to small businesses in those states, though the number of applications for unemployment benefits remains high.The latest jobless claims follow a devastating jobs report last week. The government said the unemployment rate soared to 14.7% in April, the highest rate since the Great Depression, and employers shed a stunning 20.5 million jobs. A decade’s worth of job growth was wiped out in a single month.Even those figures failed to capture the full scale of the damage. The government said many workers in April were counted as employed but absent from work but should have been counted as temporarily unemployed.Millions of other laid-off workers didn’t look for a new job in April, likely discouraged by their prospects in a mostly shuttered economy, and weren’t included, either. If all those people had been counted as unemployed, the jobless rate would have reached nearly 24%.Most economists have forecast that the official unemployment rate could hit 18% or higher in May before potentially declining by summer.The job market’s collapse has occurred with dizzying speed. As recently as February, the unemployment rate was 3.5%, a half-century low. Employers had added jobs for a record 9½ years. Even in March, unemployment was just 4.4%.Now, with few Americans shopping, traveling, eating out or otherwise spending normally, economists are projecting that the gross domestic product — the broadest gauge of economic activity — is shrinking in the April-June quarter at a roughly 40% annual rate. That would be the deepest quarterly contraction on record.Few analysts expect a quick rebound. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned Wednesday that the virus-induced recession could turn into a prolonged downturn that would erode workers’ skills and employment connections while bankrupting many small businesses.Powell urged Congress and the White House to consider additional spending and tax measures to help small businesses and households avoid bankruptcy.Powell spoke a day after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, proposed a $3 trillion aid package that would direct money to state and local governments, households and health-care workers. Trump administration officials have countered that they want to first see how previous federal aid packages affect the economy. And Republican leaders in Congress have expressed skepticism about approving significant more spending right now.Trump is applauding the moves to reopen states’ economies in hopes of reducing unemployment. So far, there is limited evidence on how that is working.Homebase, a software company that provides time-clock technology to small businesses, has tracked how many employees have clocked in and for how many hours since the pandemic struck. Though Homebase’s data suggests that some people have returned to work in states that have partially reopened, it’s unclear how sustainable that trend can be unless many more customers return. All states remain far below their pre-virus employment levels.In Georgia, which began reopening in late April, the number of people working at small businesses on Tuesday was down 37% compared with the beginning of March, according to Homebase’s data. That is an improvement from mid-April, when the number of employees working had fallen by half.In New York, which remains mostly shut down, employment at small businesses is down 63% as of Tuesday, only slightly better than in mid-April.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/36-million-have-sought-us-unemployment-aid-since-coronavirus-hit/story-vwVdCbHV4SvCUWchesR6IK.html
14-05-2020||World||Temperature checks, masks the new normal for air travel, says Dubai airport CEO||Temperature screening and face masks will become common sights at airports to mitigate the spread of the new coronavirus but physical distancing could make flying more expensive, the head of Dubai airport said. Around the world, governments, airports and airlines are considering temporary safety measures to restart air travel, including mandatory temperature checks, wearing face masks and keeping passengers apart.“We are going to have to take whatever measures are necessary to protect the travelling public and our staff,” Chief Executive Paul Griffiths told Reuters.Dubai International, one of the world’s busiest airports, suspended passenger services in late March as the United Arab Emirates took drastic measures to contain the virus. The UAE has since allowed some repatriation flights and eased other restrictions in the Gulf state, though it is not clear when normal flights will restart. Temporary safety measures should be expected as flights resume but Griffiths cautioned physical distancing rules would eventually limit growth as demand rebounds.“We will not be able to operate at anything close to our original design capacity if we had to maintain social distancing,” he said.Dubai airport, the hub of airline Emirates, was handling Airbus A380s with over 600 passengers before the virus forced the airport to halt flights.Physical distancing could also increase airfares if airlines were restricted to selling fewer tickets in order to keep some seats empty, Griffiths said.FIT TO TRAVELBut until there was a vaccine, treatment or reliable, quick method to detect the virus, measures that reduce the risk of contagion would need to be enforced, Griffiths said.It is unclear when global travel will recover from the pandemic which has shattered demand and will partially depend on countries lifting their lockdowns.Regaining public confidence in the safety of air travel is seen by the aviation industry as a significant challenge. Countries that have the spread of the virus under control and agree to reopen their borders to each other are likely to drive air travel demand over the near term, Griffiths said, but it is impossible to say when travel could return to pre-pandemic levels.Passenger traffic at Dubai airport fell by a fifth in the first quarter to 17.8 million as countries closed their borders due to the coronavirus outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/temperature-checks-masks-the-new-normal-for-air-travel-says-dubai-airport-ceo/story-6JoSjUNki5M8yMNjj3M8IM.html
14-05-2020||World||Typhoon hits Philippines as some places see covid pandemic relief||A typhoon that slammed into the Philippines on Thursday forced a risky evacuation for tens of thousands of people during the coronavirus pandemic, while New Zealand and Japan were among countries to relax restrictions as the virus is brought under control in some places.Typhoon Vongfong added the threat of flooding and landslides to the further spread of COVID-19 as people in the eastern Philippines were evacuated into shelters. Officials were seeking to open up more shelter space so people could create more physical distance from themselves, something that was a clear challenge as fierce rains and winds battered the region.As the pandemic restrictions across the globe inflict damage on economies, several governments promised relief. New Zealand’s government said it plans to borrow and spend vast amounts of money as it tries to keep unemployment below 10%.“We face a global economic and health crisis not seen since the Great Depression,” Finance Minister Grant Robertson said.In Italy, one of the worst-hit countries, Premier Giuseppe Conte promised a massive package of tax cuts and other financial aid to help businesses and families.“Your cry of alarm didn’t escape us,” Conte said late Wednesday.His government also promised to legalize the status of foreigners, many of them illegal migrants who are crop-pickers, baby-sitters and caretakers.The world’s public health measures continue to provoke conflict between officials and the public.In Ethiopia, police said they arrested over 1,000 people for refusing to wear face masks in public, while in Greece a spat broke out over a government plan to install cameras in high school classrooms. The idea is to provide live-streaming to allow for reduced classroom attendance when schools reopen next week. But a privacy watchdog and a left-wing opposition party called cameras a serious privacy risk.In many parts of the world, communities and individuals were finding inventive ways to cope with what many view as a “new normal.”Apartment dwellers in Rio de Janeiro were getting some much-needed entertainment from children’s movies projected onto screens set up outside their buildings, similar to a drive-in theater.Cesar Miranda Ribeiro, president of city-owned RioFilme company, said the effort, called “Cinema in the Windows,” is aimed at “trying to take care of the mental health of the people.”Chinese people looking for some stay-at-home retail therapy have tuned into livestream shopping.Others seeking spiritual support and human connections are worshipping remotely via online religious services, including from the Vatican to village churches.“People in general, I think, are looking for more meaning and spirituality in the midst of all this,” said Omar Suleiman, an Islamic leader in Irving, Texas, whose Yaqeen Institute for Islamic Research has been uploading YouTube videos. “So I think there’s just a general increase in religiosity and consumption of religious content.”For most leaders, though, the focus was a far more worldly one: how to get back to business and revive economies reeling from record numbers of job losses and chilling uncertainty.Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Thursday announced the lifting of an ongoing state of emergency in most parts of the country ahead of schedule.Abe lifted the measure for 39 of the country’s 47 prefectures, effective immediately, while keeping the measure in place for eight others, including Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto and Hokkaido, where risks still remain high.“Today is the new beginning for our daily lives, a new normal,” Abe said, but also warning of the risk of a resurgence of the disease.In New Zealand, malls, retail stores and restaurants reopened Thursday and many people returned to their workplaces as the nation of 5 million people ended most of its coronavirus lockdown restrictions. But most gatherings will be limited to 10 people and social distancing guidelines will remain in place.The U.S. has the largest coronavirus outbreak in the world by far: 1.39 million infections and over 84,000 deaths, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. Worldwide, the virus has infected more than 4.3 million people and killed some 297,000. Experts say the actual numbers are likely far higher.A top U.S. immunologist who says he lost his government job because he warned the Trump administration to prepare for the coronavirus pandemic said he was ready to tell Congress that America faces its “darkest winter in modern history” unless leaders act decisively to prevent a rebound of the coronavirus.Dr. Rick Bright’s testimony due Thursday follows this week’s warning by Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government’s top infectious disease expert, that rushing to lift store-closing and stay-at-home restrictions could “turn back the clock,” seeding more suffering and death and complicating efforts to get the economy rolling again.But the pressure is on to staunch job losses after the U.S. unemployment rate soared to 14.7% in April, the highest since the Great Depression.The fallout from the pandemic includes heightened political tensions between nations.In China, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian, criticized the United States, saying authorities there have failed to effectively fight the global coronavirus pandemic and “abused American people’s trust.”Zhao appeared to be firing back against accusations from the Trump administration that China mishandled or deliberately delayed releasing information about the outbreak, first detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.Zhao said the U.S. should “focus more on fighting the epidemic and safeguarding the lives and health of the American people, and stop playing such buck-passing game.”Australia said it will push for an inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus even if it hurts trade relations with China. Prime Minister Scott Morrison had been accused of playing “deputy sheriff” to the United States after calling for the inquiry.Morrison brushed off the criticism, telling reporters: “We have always been independent, we have always pursued our national interests, and we always will.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/typhoon-hits-philippines-as-some-places-see-covid-pandemic-relief/story-sMVCLP3178LGm9OmtUz6ZP.html
14-05-2020||World||Fresh test for Wuhan as cluster sparks mass coronavirus screening||Nervous residents of China’s pandemic epicentre of Wuhan queued up across the city to be tested for the coronavirus on Thursday after a new cluster of cases sparked a mass screening campaign.Lines of socially distanced people formed at makeshift testing sites set up under tents in parking lots, parks and residential communities as it rained in the metropolis of 11 million people.“This is a good thing. It’s a way to be responsible toward others and to yourself,” a 40-year-old man told AFP after completing the process.He had already been tested 10 days before but given Wuhan’s history as the source of the virus and China’s worst-hit city, he welcomed a little extra insurance. The man added: “If you have the opportunity, wouldn’t you do it again?”The previously unknown contagion emerged in Wuhan late last year, prompting the Chinese government to impose a tight lockdown on the city on January 23, isolating the industrial and transport centre from the rest of the country and confining residents to their homes.More than 3,800 people have died from COVID-19 in the city, accounting for the vast majority of fatalities in China.The quarantine was only fully lifted in early April, and life is returning to normal.But Wuhan was given a fresh jolt when several new local infections emerged last weekend after more than a month in which none were reported.Fearful of a reliving the virus nightmare, officials have launched a drive to conduct nucleic acid tests on the city’s entire population.Men, women, children and the elderly filed forward to medical workers in head-to-toe white protective suits and plastic face shields, who recorded their personal details before quickly jabbing a swab into the backs of their throats.On edge Some remained anxious.“I know this plan requiring the city to do large-scale testing serves as a basic safeguard. I wasn’t planning to get myself tested,” said a woman who did not give her name.“But the safety measures inside are really bad. (People) are too close, and the testing person handled a lot of samples from people but I didn’t see him wash his hands.”China has largely brought the virus under control, but has been on edge recently about a potential second wave of infections as it has lifted lockdowns and restrictions across the country.Besides the six new Wuhan cases, virus clusters have appeared in recent weeks in the northeastern provinces of Jilin and Heilongjiang, which border Russia.With the virus taking hold in other nations, China has barred most foreigners from entering the country.Despite the lingering concerns, pandemic-hardened residents of Wuhan have done their best to resume their lives.Dozens of people kicked up their heels to Chinese folk music on a promenade by the Yangtze River on Wednesday night, shrugging off the concerns of a new wave.Couples wearing masks pranced under street lamps, with the men leading the women into turns near a bridge lit with huge Chinese characters saying: “Go Wuhan”.“I’m very happy (to be dancing outside),” said Qiu Jumei, a 53-year-old hotel waitress.“The atmosphere wasn’t the same when I was at home and dancing alone. It was not fun,” she added. “This is much better.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fresh-test-for-wuhan-as-cluster-sparks-mass-coronavirus-screening/story-ShOqZtikEqXflNBgHTwq6K.html
14-05-2020||World||Donald Trump says he won’t renegotiate phase one China trade deal||President Donald Trump said he won’t renegotiate his so-called “phase one” trade deal with China, despite the country falling short on agreements to purchase additional U.S. exports.“We’re not going to renegotiate,” he said in an interview with Fox Business Network broadcast Thursday.While Chinese purchases of U.S. agricultural goods have recently picked up, the Global Times, a Communist Party publication, reported earlier this month that Beijing was weighing voiding or renegotiating the deal. The publication said that officials in the Chinese government were angered by U.S. criticism of China’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic.Trump said Thursday that while he still suspects the outbreak may be connected to a virology lab in Wuhan, China, he said it was unlikely the Chinese deliberately unleashed the pathogen. “I think more likely it got out of control,” he said.The president agreed with Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo that China is trying to steal intellectual property and beat the U.S. to a coronavirus vaccine.“We can stop them, they’re going to try doing it,” he said. “I mean, you can stop doing business with them, that’s one thing.”He didn’t elaborate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-says-he-won-t-renegotiate-phase-one-china-trade-deal/story-vKunwJ54uNozgAkykDVk5J.html

14-05-2020||World||Mallya extradition in homestretch after appeal blocked, countdown starts||The extradition of businessman Vijay Mallya to face charges of major financial offences neared on Thursday after the high court of England and Wales refused him permission to appeal in the UK Supreme Court on the ground that his case does not involve a ‘point of law of general public importance’.The development marks one of the last stages of Mallya’s long-drawn extradition process that began with his arrest in London in April 2017. The high court decision means that the extradition will need to be carried out within 28 days as set out in the Extradition Act, 2003.The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) acting on India’s behalf said Mallya was refused permission on all his three points: to hear oral submissions, to grant a certificate on the questions as drafted by his defence team, and to grant permission to appeal to the Supreme Court.The decision of judges Stephen Irwin and Elisabeth Laing was based ‘on papers’ presented, not in an open court based on oral hearings, and communicated by email to CPS and Mallya’s defence team.Officials said that if the pronouncement were being made in an open court it would have been: “The Court having signified its intention to refuse to certify a point of law of general public importance with a view to an appeal to the Supreme Court, the case has been listed for pronouncement, without attendance of the parties, as this has the effect of fixing the start date of the ‘required period’, as defined by section 36 and section 118 of the Extradition Act 2003, within which the extradition must be carried out”.Mallya has the option of approaching the European Court of Human Rights on the ground that his human rights would be at risk if extradited, but the CPS said “the removal process however can continue until such time as it is stayed by the ECHR”. The UK remains subject to the jurisdiction of ECHR until the end of the Brexit transition period on December 31.Nick Vamos, former head of extraditions at CPS, said: “Mallya can renew his appeal on human rights grounds if the circumstances change, for example if his health significantly worsened. He can also appeal to the European Court of Human Rights, although there is no guarantee that it will hear his case”.“Both of these options are long shots and neither of them stops the Indian and UK authorities from now making the practical arrangements to surrender Mallya into Indian custody as soon as possible. I imagine the flight schedule is already being agreed”.Mallya reiterated on Thursday his offer to repay the loans his company Kingfisher airlines had taken from banks, and close the case. He tweeted: “Congratulations to the Government for a Covid 19 relief package.”“They can print as much currency as they want BUT should a small contributor like me who offers 100% payback of State owned Banks be constantly ignored? Please take my money unconditionally and close”.Vijay Mallya extradition case timeline:--- March 2, 2016: Arrives in London from India.--- February 21, 2017: India’s extradition request certified by Home secretary.--- April 18, 2017: Arrested and bailed.--- April 24, 2017: Indian passport revoked.--- May 2, 2017: Resigns as member of Rajya Sabha.--- June 13, 2017: Series of case management and extradition hearings in the Westminster Magistrates Court.--- December 10, 2018: Chief magistrate Emma Arbuthnot clears extradition and sends file to home secretary.--- February 3, 2019: Home secretary orders extradition to India.--- April 5, 2019: Judge David of the high court of England and Wales refuses permission on papers to appeal.--- July 2, 2019: In an oral hearing, Judge Leggatt and Judge Popplewell allow permission to appeal on the ground that the Arbuthnot was wrong to conclude that India had established a prima facie case against Mallya.--- May 11-13, 2019: Judge Irwin and Judge Laing hear appeal.--- April 20, 2020: Appeal refused.--- May 14, 2020: High court refuses permission to approach the Supreme Court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vijay-mallya-s-extradition-nears-after-refused-recourse-to-supreme-court/story-7K9Ii8xSPHI2VL5tFkZwiP.html
14-05-2020||World||Nirav Modi cites rats, insects in Mumbai jail to avoid extradition||India has provided sovereign assurances and details of the Barrack number 12 of Arthur Road jail in Mumbai, where diamantaire Nirav Modi facing extradition is to be lodged, as a British valuer of gems and jewellery deposed in his favour on the fourth day of his trial on Thursday.Modi’s trial was adjourned until September 7 after valuer Richard Taylor answered queries from defence lawyer Claire Montgomery and prosecution lawyer Helen Malcolm on the diamond industry and the significance of Modi’s company.Conditions in Indian jails have been one of the major objections highlighted in extradition cases in the UK. The issue was dealt with in exhaustive detail in the Vijay Mallya case, in which the Westminster Magistrates Court upheld India’s assurances and details submitted.Similar objections have been raised by Modi’s defence team – including alleged presence of rats, insects, uncovered drains and noise from slums near the jail – as part of its contention that there is risk to his human rights in the Arthur Road jail.UK courts are obliged to refuse extradition if there is a risk to the requested person’s human rights in the country that makes the extradition request.As in the Mallya case, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) opposed Modi’s claims in its ‘skeleton argument’, stating that his submissions “fail to acknowledge the recent consideration of this issue in the Mallya proceedings” by judge Emma Arbuthnot of the magistrates court in her December 2018 judgement.The CPS documents states: “In Mallya, the Senior District Judge was required to consider assurances offered by the GOI (government of India) in the same terms as those offered in this case. She conducted an exhaustive consideration of whether those assurance could be accepted…She concluded that they could be accepted”.The assurances provided by the ministry of home affairs, the CPS told the court, are plainly sufficient to meet the concerns raised by Modi’s team. The document goes on to specifically address points raised and cited video footage of the jail and other submissions as evidence:Overcrowding: Barrack No. 12 has two cells, with a maximum capacity of six inmates (per cell). The RP (requested person) would be provided a minimum of 3 square meters of personal space throughout the course of his detention. The video of the cell amply demonstrates availability of sufficient space.Heat, noise and lack of privacy: This is not accepted. Barrack No. 12 has adequate space, which ensures privacy. The cell is well ventilated and provides adequate air circulation and the concern about heat is unfounded. There is no noise in the cell which is separated from its surroundings by at least 20 feet by way of thick high stone walls.Metal casing causing excessive heat in the cell: The metal casing starts after clearing a ground level of 20 feet and provides a security cover to the cell. The ground clearance of 20 feet ensures adequate air circulation and actually helps in regulating temperatures. Further the ceiling is about 20 feet high and hence naturally cool in summers. Mumbai has a moderate climate and does not experience extreme temperature.Insufficient/natural light: The video amply shows adequate natural light enough to allow reading during day time. In addition, there are ‘06 tube lights’ to afford adequate artificial light at night. The lights are shown in the video.Dust and noise pollution from the adjoining slum areas: The concern is unfounded as the cell is separated from the outside area by way of a thick 20 feet high stone wall.Uncovered drains and presence of rats and insects: The video clearly shows that there are no uncovered drains in and around Barrack No.12. There are no rats or insects in the cell, another fact demonstrated by the video. The assurance further provides that the Municipal Corporation visits Barrack No. 12 once a week and fumigates the barrack.Absence of pharmacy/medicines: Round the clock medicare facilities assured by the government of India naturally include medicines as prescribed by doctors and specialists and the same would be provided to the RP as and when so prescribed.Access to hospitals: A 24-hour ambulance service is available to carry inmates to the nearby hospitals if required.Emergency access to hospitals: The ambulance service is available 24 hours a day.The CPS said India has provided “comprehensive rebuttals” to the evidence served on Modi’s behalf, adding that “no evidence has been served that justifies a departure from the approach taken in Mallya”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nirav-modi-cites-rats-insects-in-mumbai-jail-to-avoid-extradition/story-tH1bAJmuekLdVAsTSgC1AM.html

14-05-2020||World||UN economic experts hail India’s ‘impressive’ stimulus package to revive Covid hit economy||Top UN experts have hailed as “impressive” India’s Rs 20 lakh crore stimulus package, the largest so far among the developing countries, to revive its economy, which has been severely hit by the coronavirus-triggered lockdown.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday announced massive new financial incentives on top of the previously announced packages for a combined stimulus of Rs 20 lakh crore (USD 260 billion).While launching the World Economic Situation and Prospect (WESP) report update on Wednesday, Chief of the Global Economic Monitoring Branch Hamid Rashid told reporters in response to a question that the stimulus package announced by the Indian government on Tuesday “is a very welcome development.” He said the Rs 20 lakh crore package, which is 10 per cent of India’s GDP is the “largest so far in the developing countries” because most developing countries have been rolling out stimulus packages that are between 0.5 per cent and 1 per cent of the GDP.“India’s stimulus packages are very large. And also India has the domestic financial market and the large capacity to implement that large stimulus package,” he said, adding that impact of the package would depend on the design of the stimulus.The mega Rs 20 lakh crore stimulus package includes previously announced measures to save the lockdown-battered economy, and focuses on tax breaks for small businesses as well as incentives for domestic manufacturing.The combined package works out to roughly 10 per cent of the GDP, making it among the most substantial in the world after the financial packages announced by the US, which is 13 per cent of its GDP, and by Japan, which is over 21 per cent of its GDP.Associate Economic Affairs Officer, Economic Analysis and Policy Division, Department of Economic and Social Affairs (EAPD/UN DESA) Julian Slotman told PTI in an interview that the size of India’s stimulus package is “impressive” and “seems to be of a magnitude that will help to reassure markets and to boost domestic consumption. But at the same time when people are simply not able to spend, you cannot expect the economic growth to suddenly magically re-appear.” Lauding the Indian government for implementing a strict lockdown while the number of COVID19 cases was relatively low, he said at some point it will be inevitable to gradually ease the restrictions but warned that that could result in infections increasing in the country.“Fortunately in India, the central government acted very decisively in implementing the national lockdown” when the number of virus cases was relatively low and “it seems to have slowed the spread of the disease somewhat,” he said.“The decisive containment measures are absolutely critically necessary and a strong lockdown is critical in India,” he said, adding that the duration of the lockdown has to also be economically feasible.“It is putting tremendous pressure on the Indian economy and of course disproportionately hurting the people that are the most vulnerable and poor.” He said that in India, priority must be given to reduce uncertainty first so that people can eventually go out and spend again.He urged the Indian government to exercise maximum caution in easing the lockdown, saying the country should “not hasten anything unnecessarily. There are ways to gradually lift restrictions,” he said.He added that with a large informal sector in India, the lockdown has disproportionately affected women and migrant workers. Meanwhile, the UN on Wednesday slashed India’s projected GDP growth rate to 1.2 per cent in 2020-21 as the COVID19 pandemic ravages the global economy. In the WESP report update, the UN DESA said that global GDP is forecast to contract sharply by 3.2 per cent as the COVID-19 pandemic paralyses the world, sharply restricting economic activities, increasing uncertainties and unleashing a recession unseen since the Great Depression.“Cumulatively, the world economy is expected to lose nearly USD 8.5 trillion in output in 2020 and 2021, nearly wiping out the cumulative output gains of the previous four years,” the report said.India’s economic growth is forecast to slow to 1.2 per cent in the current fiscal, a further deterioration from the already slowed growth of 4.1 per cent in 2019. India, which grew at 6.8 per cent in fiscal year 2018, is forecast to recover and clock a 5.5 per cent growth rate in 2021.The Economic Survey, released a day before Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented the Union Budget for 2020-21 on February 1, had projected a GDP growth of 6-6.5 per cent, up from 5 per cent estimate for 2019-20.“The national lockdown in India, for example, is expected to depress economic growth to just 1.2 per cent, much lower than the already disappointing growth in 2019,” the report said.Despite the considerably slowed growth rate of 1.2 per cent, India is still the second fastest-growing major economy in the world after China.According to estimates in the report, India and China are the only two economies in the world that are not projected to shrink in 2020 even though their growth rates slow down considerably. While India could clock a 1.2 per cent GDP growth, China is estimated to record a 1.7 per cent growth rate.All other economies in the world, including the US (-4.8 per cent), Japan (-4.2 per cent), European Union (-5.5 per cent) and the United Kingdom (-5.4 per cent) are projected to shrink this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-economic-experts-hail-india-s-impressive-stimulus-package-to-revive-covid-hit-economy/story-iT1331LokbUccpA9GzzTHP.html

He says the world must “create a new normal in which we don’t have to choose between health and livelihood.”Kasai said Thursday that countries must strengthen their health system and have measures in place for early detection, isolation and contact tracing, and ensure they are ready for the possibility of large-scale community outbreak.If a resurgence occurs, Kasai said governments must also be prepared to reinstate strict health measures as everybody remains at risk until a vaccine is developed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-reopening-of-economies-must-be-done-cautiously-says-who/story-oal4mEZYBau6hRzIsBdFEM.html

14-05-2020||World||Covid-19: Taiwan says WHO has ‘forgotten’ neutrality by barring island||The World Health Organization (WHO) has “forgotten” its professionalism and neutrality in locking Taiwan out of the body for political reasons, Taiwan Vice President Chen Chien-jen said on Thursday.Taiwan says China and the WHO have conspired for political purposes to keep it out of key meetings, that the WHO has not responded to requests for coronavirus information and has misreported the number of its infections.The WHO and China have strongly dispute the accusations, saying Taiwan has been given all the help it needed, but that only China, which claims democratic Taiwan as one of its provinces, has the right to fully represent it in the WHO.Chen, a U.S.-trained epidemiologist, said the WHO had been putting politics above health.“Unfortunately, because of political reasons, Taiwan’s 23 million people have become orphans in the global health system,” he told reporters at the presidential office in Taipei.“The WHO pays too much attention to politics and has forgotten their professionalism and neutrality. This is quite regrettable.”While the WHO has done good work and contributed to world health in the past, its record on the virus has not been as good, Chen added.“On the Wuhan pneumonia, we mostly criticise them for acting too slowly,” he said, referring to the central Chinese city where the virus first emerged late last year, before spreading worldwide to infect 4.3 million people and kill 295,000.Chen, who was Taiwan’s health minister during the 2002-2003 SARS crisis, said the world needed to be cautious with China’s virus numbers, and urged Beijing to be more transparent.He wished China well in its fight, however.“Here I give my blessings to them and hope that they can contain the Wuhan pneumonia as early as possible and avoid a second wave,” said Chen, who leaves office when President Tsai Ing-wen is sworn in for her second term next week.Taiwan has lobbied to attend next week’s meeting of the WHO’s decision-making World Health Assembly as an observer, but China objects.In Beijing, foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said Taiwan’s basis for participation in the WHO was damaged by the refusal of its ruling Democratic Progressive Party to recognise that the island is part of China.There is no legal basis for a “non-sovereign region” to participate as an observer, Zhao added.The United States has repeatedly clashed with China over its refusal to allow Taiwan full access to the body, helping to further fuel tension between Washington and Beijing.Taiwan’s tally of 440 virus infections and seven deaths is far lower than many of its neighbours, thanks to early and effective prevention work and an efficient public health system.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-taiwan-says-who-has-forgotten-neutrality-by-barring-island/story-aVmKVxzIQaEYGxeCkYYF6N.html

But again I have to stress that this is a best-case scenario, we know not all vaccines that come into development may not make it to authorisation and disappear,” he added.“We know also that there may be delays.”The agency was however “a bit sceptical” about reports that a vaccine could be ready as soon as September.The Amsterdam-based EU agency meanwhile played down fears expressed by the World Health Organization that the virus “may never go away”.“I think it’s a bit early to say but we have good reason to be sufficiently optimistic that some vaccines will make it,” Cavaleri said.“I would be surprised that if at the end of the day we don’t have any vaccine for COVID-19.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-vaccine-could-be-ready-in-a-year-eu-agency/story-cI9F9IxZAnW2FM88t8DzjM.html
14-05-2020||World||Cape Town becomes center of South Africa’s coronavirus pandemic||The coronavirus outbreak in South Africa has hit hardest in the Western Cape, home to the city of Cape Town. The province now has more than half of the 12,074 confirmed cases nationwide and in recent days contributed about 90% of new infections recorded by the Health Ministry.Contrary to initial projections, infections and deaths have increased at a much slower rate in the economic hub of Johannesburg in Gauteng province. The Western Cape and Gauteng together account for about 37% of South Africa’s population. The Western Cape has registered 117 virus-related deaths out of 219 nationwide, and Gauteng 24. Most of the infections and deaths have been in Cape Town, one of the world’s most popular tourist destinations.Click here for full coronavirus coverageWhile Western Cape authorities attribute the surge in cases to “a rigorous approach to testing,” the province is facing clusters of infections in households, work places and supermarkets. That explains why the area also has a higher number of people who test positive -- between 7% to 9%, compared to a national average of between 2% to 3%, according to Tulio de Oliveira, a bioinformatician with the Nelson R. Mandela School of Medicine at the University of KwaZulu Natal.“Localized outbreaks are common,” De Oliveira said. “We’ve seen it in nursing homes in the U.K. and recently in nightclubs in South Korea. It’s the normal biology of the virus and it’s happening at a higher frequency in the Western Cape.”The rest of the country is unlikely to be spared.“We may eventually see this in other parts of the country,” he said. “The question isn’t why it hasn’t happened in Gauteng, but why it hasn’t happened yet.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cape-town-becomes-center-of-south-africa-s-coronavirus-pandemic/story-wQctB2schGUYdCogTPru1O.html
14-05-2020||World||Canadian favourability towards China ‘at a new low’: Report||The attitude of Canadians about China has taken a sharp nosedive over the last months with just 14 per cent feeling positive about the Asian nation, and much of this dislike is precipitated by strong distrust of Beijing over its transparency in dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageAccording to a new public opinion poll, Canadian favourability towards China is “at a new low.” The non-profit polling agency Angus Reid Institute or ARI noted, “As nations have responded to the pandemic, Canadian views towards China are in an apparent free-fall, as favourability of the nation hits a new low, dropping to 14 per cent – half of where it was in late 2019, and representing just a quarter of where favourability towards China stood in 2017.”Some of that decline can be attributed to a perceived lack of openness from China that may have contributed to the coronavirus crisis. As the pollster said, “More than four-in-five (85%) Canadians say the Chinese government has not been honest about what has happened in its own country.” These negative leanings towards China are also leading Canadians to be against the participation of the Chinese company Huawei in 5G infrastructure in Canada and overall against increasing trade with China. As the poll found: “If Canadians had their way, there would be real-world consequences to perceived malfeasance on the part of the Asian power. Just 11 per cent of Canadians say Canada should focus its trade efforts on China, down from 40 per cent in 2015. Further, four-in-five say Canada should bar Huawei from taking part in the building of new 5G infrastructure in this country.”The fall in the percentage of Canadians with a positive view of China is perceptible. In 58 per cent could be considered pro-China, and that figure was at 48 per cent even in 2017. But 2018 proved a watershed year in relations between Canada and China.As ARI stated, “Canadian opinion towards China has significantly declined since that government arrested and detained two Canadians in prison, in a tit-for-tat reaction to Canada’s arrest – and subsequent release on bail – of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou.”Compounding matters has been the alleged cover-up by China that led to Covid-19 going global. ARI said Canadians appear to share ‘concerns” such as those voiced by United States officials. As much as 85 per cent of those polled either strongly disagreed or disagreed with the statement that ‘The Chinese government has been transparent and honest about the Covid-19 situation in that country.’Preference for strengthening the trade relation between Canada and China has also plummeted from 40 per cent supporting it in April 2015 to just 11 per cent in May 2020. And only 14 per cent are for allowing Huawei to play a role in building 5G mobile networks in Canada as against 21 per cent in November last year.In effect, Canadians want the nature of the relationship to alter dramatically, as the poll stated, “Three-quarters (76%) of Canadians now say the most important aspect of their country’s relationship with China should be upholding human rights and the rule of law, not trade investment and opportunity. This represents a hardening of opinion over the last 18 months.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-favourability-towards-china-at-a-new-low/story-2xNQYLI7sDnLRTAfPkLdxN.html
14-05-2020||World||Twin antibodies that may help fight Covid-19 identified||Scientists have identified a pair of neutralising antibodies -- isolated from a patient who recovered from COVID-19 -- that may offer therapeutic benefits, and help design molecule antivirals and vaccine candidates to fight the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The antibodies identified by the researchers, including those from Chinese Academy of Sciences, bind to the glycoprotein spike of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, blocking the spike’s ability to bind to the human ACE2 receptor and mediate viral entry into host cells. Preliminary tests of the two antibodies, named B38 and H4, in a mouse model resulted in a reduction of virus titers, the researchers said. The finding, published in the journal Science, suggests that the antibodies may offer therapeutic benefits -- in addition to informing the design of small molecule therapeutics and vaccine candidates to fight COVID-19, they said. Researcher Yan Wu from Capital Medical University, China and colleagues found that the antibodies can each bind simultaneously to different epitopes on the spike’s receptor binding domain (RBD). Due to this binding, both antibodies together may confer a stronger neutralising effect than either antibody on its own -- a prediction supported by in vitro experiments, they said. This feature also means that, should one of the viral epitopes mutate in a way that prevents the binding of one of the two antibodies, the other may still retain its neutralising activity, according to the researchers. By imaging the structure of the viral spike’s RBD bound to B38, the team confirmed that the antibody binds to a subset of the amino acids bound by ACE2, they said. This, the researchers explained, provides an explanation for why the B38 antibody confers such strong neutralising effects. They suggest that a “cocktail” containing both antibodies could provide direct therapeutic benefits for COVID-19 patients. The finding regarding the viral spike epitopes could also aid the development of small molecule antivirals and vaccine candidates to fight the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the researchers added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twin-antibodies-that-may-help-fight-covid-19-identified/story-53uLLj6ZQdlKRG0vUK1KjI.html

Dozens of civilians are feared to be dead and wounded,” said Tariq Arian, an interior ministry spokesman. Emal Khan Momand, a military spokesman in Paktia province where Gardez is located, said the attack was carried out by a truck packed with explosives. Five people were killed and 14 were wounded, he said.There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blast. Arian blamed the militant Haqqani network, which has ties to Taliban rebels and the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba militant group. These groups rarely publicly claim responsibility for attacks.The blast comes after a violent week in which gunmen attacked a maternity hospital in Kabul, killing 24 people, including new mothers and newborn babies, on Tuesday. A suicide blast claimed by the Islamic State at a funeral in eastern Nangahar on the same day killed 32.President Ashraf Ghani condemned the attacks and said he had ordered the military to switch to offensive mode rather than the defensive stance it had adopted as the United States withdraws troops and tries to broker talks with the Taliban.The Taliban has denied any involvement in the attacks, but the government has accused the group of fostering an environment in which terrorism thrives or working with other militant groups who could have been involved, straining efforts by the United States to bring the insurgents and the Afghan government together.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/truck-bomb-in-eastern-afghanistan-s-gardez-kills-five-14-injured/story-yfbrQdLzCObaEKNxymdFSJ.html
14-05-2020||World||SCO foreign ministers discuss consensus approach for peace, stability in Afghanistan||The need for a consensus approach to establish peace in Afghanistan figured in a video conference of foreign ministers of SCO states on Wednesday, with external affairs minister S Jaishankar seeking collective action to root out terrorism that threatens regional peace.Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov, who convened the meeting, said the US-Taliban agreement had stalled and a settlement in Afghanistan would be possible only if it accommodates the interests of the war-torn country’s closest neighbours.Most of the discussions during the video conference, also joined by Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi and Pakistan’s foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi, centred round the Covid-19 crisis and the need for coordinated efforts to deal with its trade, economic and social consequences.During his address, Jaishankar emphasised that security challenges faced by the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) states “are not linked by physical or political boundaries”. He added, “Terrorism continues to be the overwhelming threat to security and stability in the SCO region and would require collective action.”In an apparent reference to Pakistan, he added, “Even as the world fights Covid-19, some are busy spreading other deadly viruses such as terrorism. Fake news and doctored videos are also used to divide communities and countries…”The world community had seen the prospect of growth evaporate because of the pandemic and this will mean many in India won’t be able to overcome poverty, Jaishankar said. The crisis also disrupted production networks and supply chains and SCO states should identify new ways to sustain economic growth, he said.Lavrov, in his address to the video conference, said the situation in Afghanistan poses a serious challenge to regional security. The situation, he added, had worsened despite steps taken to push forward the peace process.“It is obvious that political settlement and putting Afghanistan on the peaceful track is impossible without the participation of the countries in the region,” he said, adding mechanisms such as the Moscow Format and the SCO-Afghanistan Contact Group could help provide solutions.A senior Russian official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said: “Russia has always favoured a consensus approach because a solution will have to involve all the countries in the region.” The SCO-Afghanistan Contact Group is better placed to provide solutions and take forward the peace process because it includes key players in the region and Afghanistan itself, the official said.Lavrov also spoke about the need to strengthen SCO’s Regional Anti-Terrorism Structure (RATS), headquartered in Tashkent, and the need to adapt a roadmap of the SCO-Afghanistan Contact Group, which was framed during a meeting in Bishkek in 2019, to the new environment in Afghanistan, including the US-Taliban negotiations.Addressing a news briefing after the video conference, Lavrov said a settlement in Afghanistan would only be possible “based on the interests of the Afghan people and the legitimate interests of countries of the region, including the closest neighbours of Afghanistan”.“The US decided to focus only on their bilateral negotiations with the Taliban. We have nothing against it if it…takes into accounts the interests of all parties and neighbours. It is necessary to more actively involve the neighbours so that they can secure their interests,” he said.“We are not happy that the US-Taliban deal has been stalling...and we are ready to help the parties to overcome these problems. For this, we need to go back to inclusive dialogue in Afghanistan,” Lavrov added.The video conference was also joined by the foreign ministers of Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. The conference also discussed preparations for the SCO foreign ministers’ meeting in Moscow during June 9-10 and the SCO Summit in St Petersburg during July 22-23.The Russian official cited above said the Covid-19 situation continues to be dynamic and a final decision on whether the upcoming meetings will be held via video conference will be made after an assessment closer to the dates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sco-foreign-ministers-discuss-consensus-approach-for-peace-stability-in-afghanistan/story-FF6Ofr81ozHoBUc1VFTxQN.html
14-05-2020||World||Japan expected to end state of emergency for most regions; Tokyo to stay on alert||Japan was expected to lift a state of emergency across a large part of the country on Thursday, but the capital Tokyo will remain under restrictions until there is a convincing containment of the coronavirus.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is scheduled to hold a news conference at 6 p.m. (0900 GMT) where media said he is expected to announce the lifting of the state of emergency for 39 of Japan’s 47 prefectures, but not including Tokyo.The world’s third-largest economy declared a nationwide state of emergency a month ago, urging citizens to reduce person-to-person contact by 80% in an effort to slow the pace of new infections and ease the strain on medical services. The government had said it would reassess the situation in mid-May.The declaration gives governors added authority to tell people to stay home and close schools and businesses, but there is no penalty for non-compliance. Some non-essential businesses even in hard-hit areas have already started to reopen ahead of the government’s review, and the scope of restrictions has varied across the country.Abe, like leaders everywhere, is striving to strike a balance between damage to the economy from prolonged shutdowns and the need to contain the virus. The government is set to add four economists to its advisory panel for combating the epidemic, and another review will be conducted again in about a week.Economists said any normalisation would be gradual as the government treads cautiously with an eye on a possible second wave of infections such as seen in countries such as South Korea and China.“The focus is whether the government will lift the emergency on the big areas such as Tokyo and Osaka before the end of May, as was initially planned,” said Atsushi Takeda, chief economist at Itochu Research Institute.“If it does, economic recovery will likely be faster than previously estimated.”The 39 prefectures account for 54% of Japan’s population, while the greater Tokyo area that will remain under the state of emergency represents about a third of the economy.“Tokyo is the heart of the Japanese economy. It’s like driving a car with three wheels,” said Jesper Koll, chief executive of asset manager WisdomTree Japan.Fast Retailing Co, owner of casual clothing chain Uniqlo, which had already started to reopen outlets across the country, said it planned further reopenings from Friday after the state of emergency is lifted.Japan has reported 16,100 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, excluding those from a cruise ship previously quarantined in Yokohama, and 696 deaths to date from the disease it causes, COVID-19, according to public broadcaster NHK.While Japan has avoided the kind of explosive growth seen in the United States and elsewhere, its testing has also been among the lowest, at 188 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests per 100,000 people, versus 3,159 in Italy and 3,044 in Germany.Hardest-hit Tokyo has conducted just 50,000 tests so far, of which about 5,000 were positive. Although Japan’s state of emergency declaration lacks enforcement powers, mobility data has shown a marked drop in the movement of people. The government this week reported a 20% fall in the number of hospitalised COVID-19 patients in the nine days to May 7, to 4,449. In Tokyo, new cases fell to just 10 on Wednesday.Osaka, Japan’s second-biggest metropolis, is also set to remain a target of the state of emergency, but the governor has announced criteria for gradually lifting some restraints on businesses including eateries and bars.

14-05-2020||World||Gastrointestinal symptoms could indicate Covid-19 infection in kids: Study||Gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea, coupled with a fever or history of exposure to Covid-19, could indicate coronavirus infection in children, according to a new study.Published in the journal Frontiers in Pediatrics, the research also suggests that the gastrointestinal symptoms first suffered by some children hint at potential infection through the digestive tract, as the type of receptors in cells in the lungs targeted by the virus can also be found in the intestines.“Most children are only mildly affected by Covid-19 and the few severe cases often have underlying health issues. It is easy to miss its diagnosis in the early stage when a child has non-respiratory symptoms or suffers from another illness,” said study author Dr Wenbin Li from Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China.“Based on our experience of dealing with Covid-19, in regions where this virus is epidemic, children suffering from digestive tract symptoms, especially with fever and/or a history of exposure to this disease, should be suspected of being infected with this virus,” he continued.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageIn this study, the research team detail the clinical features of children admitted to hospital with non-respiratory symptoms, which were subsequently diagnosed with pneumonia and Covid-19.“These children were seeking medical advice in the emergency department for unrelated problems, for example, one had a kidney stone, another a head trauma,” said researchers.All had pneumonia confirmed by chest CT scan before or soon after admission and then confirmed to have Covid-19. While their initial symptoms may have been unrelated, or their Covid-19 symptoms were initially mild or relatively hidden before their admission to hospital, importantly, four of the five cases had digestive tract symptoms as the first manifestation of this disease.The researchers also link the children’s gastrointestinal symptoms, which have been recorded in adult patients, to an additional potential route of infection.“The gastrointestinal symptoms experienced by these children may be related to the distribution of receptors and the transmission pathway associated with Covid-19 infection in humans. The virus infects people via the ACE2 receptor, which can be found in certain cells in the lungs as well as the intestines,” Li said.This suggests that Covid-19 might infect patients not only through the respiratory tract in the form of air droplets but also through the digestive tract by contact or faecal-oral transmission.“We report five cases of Covid-19 in children showing non-respiratory symptoms as the first manifestation after admission to hospital. The incidence and clinical features of similar cases need further study in more patients,” the researchers noted.By highlighting these cases, the researchers hope that doctors will use this information to quickly diagnose and isolate patients with similar symptoms, which will aid early treatment and reduce transmission.In March, another study from China, published in The American Journal of Gastroenterology, found that diarrhoea was a prominent symptom among up to half of the patients with Covid-19 in Wuhan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gastrointestinal-symptoms-could-indicate-covid-19-infection-in-kids-study/story-AkkIQTp77R1nBtYyTogU2L.html
14-05-2020||World||A vaccine for Covid-19 won’t be enough to end the pandemic: Report||Medical experts have warned that the volume of vaccine available to fight the coronavirus or SARS-CoV-2 in coming years is expected to fall far short of global demand, despite an unprecedented effort to manufacture billions of doses.About 70 per cent of the world’s population -- or 5.6 billion people -- will probably need to be inoculated to begin to establish herd immunity and slow its spread, The Washington Post reported citing scientific research on Monday.The scenario public health experts fear most is a worldwide fight in which manufacturers will sell only to the highest bidders, rich countries trying to buy up the supplies, and nations where manufacturers have located hoard vaccines for their own citizens.“The model of countries thinking only of themselves is not going to work. Even if you’re living somewhere that’s somehow perfectly without any infections, your best efforts to fight the virus are going to fail unless you shut off all your borders and trade,” said Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, a public-private partnership that helps provide vaccines to developing countries.“This is a global problem that requires a global solution,” he added.International health advocates want to avoid a repeat of 2009, when wealthy countries -- including the United States, led by former President Barack Obama -- were at the head of the line for H1N1 swine-flu vaccine, leaving underdeveloped countries with little supply until after the pandemic subsided.Such an approach will be sorely tested by current US President Trump and other world leaders with nationalistic impulses and their own anxious populations that want to reduce the deadly threat and bring their economies back to life.In the United States, the federal government agency in charge of emergency vaccine development indicated it is prioritizing domestic concerns -- an “America First” mentality that has shaped much of the Trump administration’s pandemic response.“Right now, we’re focused on the whole-of-America approach required to expedite the availability of vaccines,” Gary Disbrow, acting director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), said in an emailed response to the Post.BARDA, tasked with protecting Americans from biological threats, is channeling nearly half a billion dollars in emergency funds to Johnson & Johnson to develop a vaccine. It also is providing hundreds of millions of dollars in financial support for vaccine efforts by Sanofi, the large French drug company, and Moderna, a biotech company in Massachusetts teaming with a Swiss company for vaccine manufacturing.The global grab for protective equipment and ventilators that left poorer countries empty-handed suggests the competition over vaccines could be at least as fierce. Dozens of companies large and small are rushing to develop vaccines using different technologies and approaches.The race for a vaccine is full of risks because no one knows which projects will succeed. That forces companies to scale up to produce millions of doses of vaccine that might end up being worthless.It should also be noted that the United States might not be well-positioned if the best vaccines end up coming from other countries or international collaborations.This race could make large drug companies enter into vaccine contracts again as they face pressure to recoup their investments, the newspaper said further.“Rich countries monopolized the vaccine, poor countries were left behind,” Gavin Yamey, director of the Center for Policy Impact in Global Health at Duke University, said in a university podcast.“They got the vaccine later, and they got less of it.” Allowing a repeat scenario in the battle against the coronavirus would be a devastating mistake, he said.“Unless we make this vaccine globally available,” he said, “we are not going to be able to end the pandemic, because ... an outbreak anywhere is an outbreak everywhere.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-vaccine-for-covid-19-won-t-be-enough-to-end-the-pandemic-report/story-2BBwfEYM8pCq5cisFfBl0N.html
14-05-2020||World||Covid-19 could become endemic like HIV, may never go away: WHO||The coronavirus that causes Covid-19 could become endemic like HIV, the World Health Organization said on Wednesday, warning against any attempt to predict how long it would keep circulating and calling for a “massive effort” to counter it.“It is important to put this on the table: this virus may become just another endemic virus in our communities, and this virus may never go away,” WHO emergencies expert Mike Ryan told an online briefing.“I think it is important we are realistic and I don’t think anyone can predict when this disease will disappear,” he added. “I think there are no promises in this and there are no dates. This disease may settle into a long problem, or it may not be.”However, he said the world had some control over how it coped with the disease, although this would take a “massive effort” even if a vaccine was found -- a prospect he described as a “massive moonshot”.More than 100 potential vaccines are being developed, including several in clinical trials, but experts have underscored the difficulties of finding vaccines that are effective against coronaviruses.Ryan noted that vaccines exist for other illnesses, such as measles, that have not been eliminated.WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus added: “The trajectory is in our hands, and it’s everybody’s business, and we should all contribute to stop this pandemic.”Ryan said “very significant control” of the virus was required in order to lower the assessment of risk, which he said remained high at the “national, regional and global levels”.Governments around the world are struggling with the question of how to reopen their economies while still containing the virus, which has infected almost 4.3 million people, according to a Reuters tally, and led to over 291,000 deaths.The European Union pushed on Wednesday for a gradual reopening of borders within the bloc that have been shut by the pandemic, saying it was not too late to salvage some of the summer tourist season while still keeping people safe.But public health experts say extreme caution is needed to avoid new outbreaks. Ryan said opening land borders was less risky than easing air travel, which was a “different challenge”.“We need to get into the mindset that it is going to take some time to come out of this pandemic,” WHO epidemiologist Maria van Kerkhove told the briefing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-could-become-endemic-like-hiv-may-never-go-away-who/story-ytoAVlix98ERO1QIbf4QbP.html

The company added it will be able to provide hundreds of thousands of antibody test kits to the UK per week.The Telegraph, which first reported the findings, stated that the government is in negotiations with Roche to buy millions of kits.UK’s Department of Health and Social Care was not immediately available for a Reuters request for comment.Health Secretary Matt Hancock had earlier said the government was in discussions with the Swiss drugmaker over antibody testing.Earlier this month, Roche’s antibody test won emergency approval from the US Food and Drug Administration. Unlike tests to diagnose diseases, antibody tests show who has been infected and recovered.As of Wednesday, UK recorded 33,186 deaths from Covid-19, the country worst-hit by the respiratory disease in Europe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/swiss-drugmaker-in-talks-with-uk-govt-to-roll-out-covid-antibody-test-kits/story-0mW7ok4FXxYLuJ3a6RxG9H.html
14-05-2020||World||Trump presses for US schools to reopen, takes dig at Fauci||President Donald Trump called on governors across the nation Wednesday to work to reopen schools that were closed because of the coronavirus, pointedly taking issue with Dr. Anthony Fauci’s caution against moving too quickly in sending students back to class.The president accused Fauci of wanting “to play all sides of the equation,” a comment that suggested he is tiring of the nation’s top infectious disease expert.“I think they should open the schools, absolutely. I think they should,” Trump told reporters at the White House, echoing comments he had made in a television interview. “Our country’s got to get back and it’s got to get back as soon as possible. And I don’t consider our country coming back if the schools are closed.”Fauci had urged caution in testimony before a Senate committee Tuesday, although he made clear that he believes reopening decisions will likely differ from one region to the next.“We don’t know everything about this virus and we really better be pretty careful, particularly when it comes to children,” Fauci told the committee. At one point, he told members that “the idea of having treatments available or a vaccine to facilitate the re-entry of students into the fall term would be something that would be a bit of a bridge too far.”Fauci later clarified that he was not implying students should be barred from returning to class until a Covid-19 vaccine is developed. But his comments were nonetheless seized on by conservative commentators, as well as Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who called the notion “kind of ridiculous.”Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“To me, it’s not an acceptable answer,” Trump said of Fauci on Wednesday. He said the coronavirus has “had very little impact on young people,” although there is growing concern over cases of a mysterious inflammatory syndrome in young people that is thought to be related to the virus.Speaking of Fauci, Trump told Maria Bartiromo in an interview for Fox Business Network’s ”Mornings with Maria” that “I totally disagree with him on schools.”Trump and Fauci have publicly disagreed before, including on the effectiveness of certain drugs that have been tested to treat the virus. Trump has also complained to aides and confidants about Fauci’s positive media attention and his willingness to contradict the president. But Trump has also acknowledge that the blowback to removing the doctor would be fierce.In his testimony, Fauci issued a blunt warning that cities and states could “turn back the clock” and see more death and economic damage if they lift stay-at-home orders too quickly — a message that stands in sharp contrast to Trump’s push to reopen the nation as he tries to blunt the economic damage caused by the pandemic during an election year.“There is a real risk that you will trigger an outbreak that you may not be able to control,” Fauci warned as more than two dozen states have begun to lift their lockdowns.Among those are Colorado and North Dakota, whose governors met with Trump on Wednesday.In North Dakota, which has had fewer cases than many other states, Republican Gov. Doug Burgum allowed most businesses to reopen May 1 with precautions that include limiting bars and restaurants to half capacity and requiring barbers and cosmetologists to wear masks.Burgum announced this week that schools may offer some summer programs beginning June 1 if local school officials approve and precautions are taken, such as limiting class sizes.At the same time, cases and deaths have continued to rise. State health officials on Tuesday reported two new deaths from Covid-19, bringing its death toll to 38. The state also reported 53 new cases, bringing the total to 1,571.Click here for Covid-19 updatesThe impact on Colorado has been far worse. The death toll there surpassed 1,000 this week, with more than 20,000 having tested positive.Democratic Gov. Jared Polis this month began to gradually relax restrictions, however, while warning there could be rollbacks if the virus surges.Polis had criticized the Federal Emergency Management Agency during the early days of the pandemic for swooping in to purchase personal protective equipment and other supplies that Colorado, like many states, had been negotiating for with private vendors. But recently he’s taken a more diplomatic approach to working with the administration.The White House has stepped up precautions in recent days to protect the president and senior administration officials from the virus after two individuals who work on the compound tested positive. Because he had contact with one of those individuals, Vice President Mike Pence has been keeping his distance from Trump, talking by phone instead of in person.“I haven’t seen Mike Pence and I miss him,” Trump said. “For a little while we’ll stay apart because you don’t know what happens with this very crazy and horrible disease.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-presses-for-us-schools-to-reopen-takes-dig-at-fauci/story-885C9mjw3DHsSkFpuJsQwL.html
14-05-2020||World||Spike in Covid-19 cases in US could emerge weeks after states reopen, say experts||US states are beginning to restart their economies after months of paralysing coronavirus lockdowns, but it could take weeks until it becomes clear whether those reopenings will cause a spike in Covid-19 cases, experts said Wednesday. The outbreak’s trajectory varies wildly across the country, with steep increases in cases in some places, decreases in others and infection rates that can shift dramatically from neighbourhood to neighbourhood. “Part of the challenge is although we are focused on the top-line national numbers in terms of our attention, what we are seeing is 50 different curves and 50 different stories playing out,” said Thomas Tsai, assistant professor at the Harvard Global Health Institute. “And what we have seen about COVID-19 is that the story and the effect is often very local.” A handful of states started easing their lockdowns about two weeks ago, ranging from shopping malls in Texas to beach hotels in South Carolina to gyms in Wyoming. Georgia was one of the first states where some businesses were allowed to open their doors again, starting April 24 with barber shops, hair salons, gyms, bowling alleys and tattoo parlors. But it may be five to six weeks from then before the effects are known, said Crystal Watson of Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. “As we saw early in the year, epidemics of COVID-19 start slow and take some time to build and become evident,” Watson said in an email. The outbreak’s trajectory can vary greatly around the country, according to an Associated Press analysis of confirmed cases. For instance, steep increases in daily new cases are occurring in Hennepin County in Minnesota, and Fairfax County in Virginia, while in others, such as Bergen County, New Jersey, and Wayne County, Michigan, there’s been a steady decline. The AP analysed case counts compiled by Johns Hopkins University, using a rolling seven-day average to account for day-to-day variability in test reporting. In Geneva, meanwhile, a top World Health Organization official warned that it’s possible the new coronavirus may be here to stay. “This virus may never go away,” Dr Michael Ryan said at a press briefing. Without a vaccine, he said it could take years for the global population to build up sufficient levels of immunity. “I think it’s important to put this on the table,” he said. “This virus may become just another endemic virus in our communities,” like other previously novel diseases such as HIV, which have never disappeared, but for which effective treatments have been developed. It can take three to five days for someone newly infected with the coronavirus to feel sick and some infected people won’t even have symptoms. Since testing is mostly reserved in the US for those with symptoms, it can take two weeks or so — the time for one group of people to spread the virus to another — to have enough testing data to reflect a surge in cases. “If you are doing adequate testing, it will take two to three weeks” to spot an increase, Dr. Ashish Jha, director of Harvard’s Global Health Institute, said Wednesday as he prepared to speak to a congressional subcommittee on the crisis. He urged a dramatic increase in testing. “It was the failure of testing that caused our country to shut down,” Jha said. “We need federal leadership on the level of testing, guidance on whom to test and federal help on the sheer capacity, the number of tests that can be done. We still do not have the testing capacity we need to open up safely.” New coronavirus clusters have surfaced around the world as nations struggle to balance restarting their economies and preventing a second wave of infections. Authorities in the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the pandemic first began late last year, reportedly are pressing ahead to test all 11 million residents for the virus within 10 days after a handful of new infections were found. In Lebanon, authorities reinstated a nationwide lockdown for four days beginning Wednesday night after a spike in reported infections and complaints that social distancing rules were being ignored. In the US, as in many countries, the lockdowns have resulted in catastrophic levels of job losses. The US unemployment rate soared to 14.7 per cent in April, the highest rate since the Great Depression. There are roughly 30 million Americans out of work. In Washington, US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned Wednesday that a prolonged recession could cause extensive damage to the economy, and urged Congress and the White House to act further to prevent long-lasting damage. The Fed and Congress have already taken immense steps, but Powell warned that numerous bankruptcies among small businesses and extended unemployment for many people remain a serious risk. While costly, more assistance in government spending or tax policies would be “worth it if it helps avoid long-term economic damage and leaves us with a stronger recovery,” he said. Powell spoke a day after Democratic leaders proposed a $3 trillion aid package that would direct money to state and local governments, households, and health-care workers. That would come on top of roughly $3 trillion in earlier financial assistance. The Fed itself has cut interest rates to near zero and created numerous emergency lending programs. But Trump administration officials have said they want to first see how previous aid packages affect the economy, and were skeptical about allowing more spending right now. The tension in balancing people’s safety against severe economic fallout is playing out across the world. Italy partially lifted lockdown restrictions last week only to see a big jump in confirmed coronavirus cases in its hardest-hit region. Pakistan reported 2,000 new infections in a single day after crowds of people crammed into local markets as restrictions were eased. In the United States, the country’s top infectious disease expert issued a blunt warning Tuesday that cities and states could see more Covid-19 deaths and economic damage if they lift stay-at-home orders too quickly. “There is a real risk that you will trigger an outbreak that you may not be able to control,” Dr. Anthony Fauci said in Senate testimony. The US has the largest coronavirus outbreak in the world by far: 1.37 million infections and over 82,000 deaths, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. Worldwide, the virus has infected more than 4.2 million people and killed some 292,000, according to the Johns Hopkins tally. Experts say the actual numbers are likely far higher.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spike-in-covid-19-cases-in-us-could-emerge-weeks-after-states-reopen-say-experts/story-v2K7D6lmD6nBYpT4WCP74O.html
14-05-2020||World||‘Don’t kiss pets’: Cats with no symptoms spread Covid-19 to other cats in lab test||Cats can spread the new coronavirus to other cats without any of them ever having symptoms, a lab experiment suggests. Scientists who led the work, reported on Wednesday, say it shows the need for more research into whether the virus can spread from people to cats to people again. Health experts have downplayed that possibility. The American Veterinary Medical Association said in a new statement that just because an animal can be deliberately infected in a lab “does not mean that it will easily be infected with that same virus under natural conditions.” Anyone concerned about that risk should use “common sense hygiene,” said virus expert Peter Halfmann. Don’t kiss your pets and keep surfaces clean to cut the chances of picking up any virus an animal might shed, he said. He and colleagues at the University of Wisconsin School of Veterinary Medicine led the lab experiment and published results Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine. Federal grants paid for the work. Researchers took coronavirus from a human patient and infected three cats with it. Each cat then was housed with another cat that was free of infection. Within five days, coronavirus was found in all three of the newly exposed animals. None of the six cats ever showed any symptoms. “There was no sneezing, no coughing, they never had a high body temperature or lost any weight,” Halfmann said. “If a pet owner looked at them ... they wouldn’t have noticed anything.” Last month, two domestic cats in different parts of New York state tested positive for the coronavirus after mild respiratory illnesses. They were thought to have picked it up from people in their homes or neighbourhoods. Some tigers and lions at the Bronx Zoo also have tested positive for the virus, as have a small number of other animals around the world. Those cases and the new lab experiment show “there is a public health need to recognize and further investigate the potential chain of human-cat-human transmission,” the authors wrote. Guidelines from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say that based on the limited information available so far, the risk of pets spreading coronavirus to people “is considered to be low.” The veterinary medicine group says “there is no evidence to suggest that animals, including pets, that may be incidentally infected by humans are playing a role in the spread of COVID-19.” It stressed that person-to-person transmission was driving the global pandemic. However, the group noted that many diseases spread between pets and people, so hygiene is always important: Wash your hands before and after touching pets, and keep your pet and its food and water bowls clean. Halfmann, whose two cats sleep near him, said the worry may be greater for animal shelters, where one infected animal could pass the virus to many others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/don-t-kiss-pets-cats-with-no-symptoms-spread-covid-19-to-other-cats-in-lab-test/story-rGjXDbQrGwZhhMsaHNc2jP.html
14-05-2020||World||US report indicates broad risk of Covid-19 at wildfire camps||Outbreaks of the coronavirus could sweep through large camps where crews typically stay as they fight wildfires across the US, according to a federal document obtained by The Associated Press, and the problem is likely to get worse the longer the fire season lasts.The US Forest Service’s draft risk assessment suggests that even in a best-case scenario — with social distancing followed and plenty of tests and protective equipment available — nearly two dozen firefighters could be infected with Covid-19 at a camp with hundreds of people who come in to combat a fire that burns for months.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe worst-case scenario? More than 1,000 infections.“The Forest Service is diligently working with partners to assess the risk that Covid-19 presents for the 2020 fire season,” the agency said in a statement Wednesday. “It is important to understand that the figures in this report are not predictions, but rather, model possible scenarios.”The Forest Service said the document was outdated and being redone, and the newest version wasn’t yet ready to share. The AP obtained the draft from an official who has access to it and didn’t want to be named.One of the authors of the risk assessment said Tuesday that in the new version, the infection rates remain the same. But while the draft originally said the death rate among infected firefighters could reach as high as 6%, that is being revised sharply downward, to less than 2%, to reflect newer data, said Jude Bayham, an assistant professor in the Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics at Colorado State University.He said the initial death rate was based on data from early in the pandemic, when testing was far more limited. Based on new data, firefighters — who are largely healthy and young — will likely fare far better if they contract Covid-19 than the general population, he said.For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially people who are older or have health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.Federal guidelines released last week reimagine how to combat wildfires to reduce the risk of firefighters getting the virus. The guidelines urge fire managers to use small crews that can have the close contact that firefighting and travel often require, while staying away from other groups. The guidelines recommend avoiding the traditional large camps and relying on military-issue ready-to-eat or bagged meals instead of catered buffet-style meals at campsites.Some fire managers also are told to take temperatures with their own touchless thermometers if possible. The guidelines say everyone should wear masks and other protective equipment when around those outside their immediate crew. Good cleaning and sanitation is recommended, as is isolating firefighters and potentially entire crews if Covid-19 is detected.A review of incident reports from wildfires so far this year show the guidelines are difficult, and sometimes impossible, to follow and could actually increase some risks to firefighters.“We have developed pinch-points that cause operational lapses in guidance that may very well get confused with policy and doctrine. This situation could result in injury — or even unwanted death — of our multiagency employees,” Greg Juvan, a fire management officer with the Idaho Panhandle National Forests, wrote in a report from a small wildfire last month.Social distancing was difficult, and firefighters found it unrealistic to meet sanitation standards for truck radios, hand tools and other gear used in the initial attack on the Idaho wildfire, Juvan said. Social distancing guidelines call for more vehicles to transport crews, but that led to congestion on the narrow roads leading to the fire. The guidelines could raise one of the greatest risks to wildland firefighters — traffic wrecks, Juvan said.Even something as basic as sanitizing vehicles proved problematic, with cleaning supplies difficult to find, the report said.In New Mexico, several agencies responded to a small wildfire last month, with some not practicing social distancing and other virus policies appearing to vary greatly, George Allalunis, a Carson National Forest engine captain, wrote in a report.For the Forest Service’s draft risk assessment, researchers created scenarios using three actual fires from 2017 and applied disease modeling. They found testing every firefighter before they started work reduced the coronavirus risk most significantly for short, high-intensity wildfires, said Bayham, the professor. But for longer, drawn-out firefights, initial testing was less important than keeping firefighters spread out in small campsites.The models showed that even with strict pre-work testing and social distancing, about 21 Covid-19 infections could be expected in a large camp like that used for a 2017 fire in Montana. In the worst-case scenario, more than 1,000 firefighters would be infected. The problem could compound as fire crews are sent to new locations over the monthslong fire season, which has largely begun.The risk assessment will be updated throughout the season, the Forest Service said.The American West could see higher-than-normal levels of wildfire this year because of drought.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-report-indicates-broad-risk-of-covid-19-at-wildfire-camps/story-ChS2Bsh48IqAK9XzkG5eGJ.html

14-05-2020||India||India objects to Pak-China decision to construct dam||India on Thursday opposed a move by Pakistan and China to build a major hydropower plant in the Gilgit-Baltistan region, saying it has shared its concerns regarding such projects with both countries.The Pakistan government on Wednesday signed a Rs 442-billion contract with a joint venture formed by China Power and the Frontier Works Organisation (FWO), a commercial arm of the Pakistani military, for constructing the Diamer-Bhasha dam.The state-run Chinese firm has a 70% stake in the joint venture and FWO 30%. The eight million acre feet reservoir with a height of 272 metres is set to be the world’s tallest roller compact concrete (RCC) dam. Construction work on the dam is expected to begin in a couple of weeks, the Pakistani media reported.Responding to the development, external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said the Gilgit-Baltistan region is part of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir that was illegally occupied by Pakistan.“Our position is consistent and clear that the entire territory of the union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh have been, are, and will continue to be an integral and inalienable part of India,” Srivastava said.“We have consistently conveyed our protest and shared concerns with both China and Pakistan on all such projects in the Indian territories under Pakistan’s illegal occupation,” he said.In the past too, India has opposed projects jointly taken up by Pakistan and China in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir as part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-objects-to-pak-china-decision-to-construct-dam/story-iRkl4uMSvSWhF9CNdRrOKJ.html
14-05-2020||India||Dust storms, rain hit northwest India||New Delhi: Squalls at a speed of up to 80 km per hour, dust and hailstorms were reported from the National Capital Region of Delhi, Haryana as well as parts of Uttar Pradesh on Thursday because of an active western disturbance.Western disturbances are low-pressure systems that generally originate over the Mediterranean region and are known to bring winter rain in India. Their intensity reduces in summer when they move to upper latitudes. The maximum temperatures have not risen in most parts of northwest India as they normally do around this time of the year because of consecutive western disturbances and associated clouds and strong winds.A wind speed of about 72 km per hour was recorded around 5.45 pm at New Delhi’s Safdarjung observatory. “North Delhi, bordering areas like Ghaziabad and Noida, parts of Haryana recorded moderate dust storm activity and hailstorm in some places. We received reports of thunder, lightning and hail from Punjabi Bagh, Rajinder Nagar [Delhi] etc. This is mainly a result of the WD [western disturbance] and induced cyclonic circulation,” said Regional Weather Forecasting Centre head Kuldeep Shrivastava.“There are reports of regular thunderstorm activity in eastern India also because it is the Kalbaisakhi season there when there is a lot of moisture incursion from the Bay of Bengal. In peninsular India, there is thunderstorm activity because of wind discontinuity which happens when winds from the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal converge.”At least 29 people were killed across 15 districts of Uttar Pradesh after rains and hailstorm lashed several parts of the state last Sunday. “There has been hailstorm activity in Telangana, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh earlier in the week. Several people were killed in Uttar Pradesh because of thunderstorms last Sunday. But now the low- pressure area over the Bay of Bengal is gaining strength. The WD and thunderstorm activity in other parts will reduce and temperatures are likely to increase,” said R K Jenamani, senior scientist at India Meteorological Department (IMD).Maximum temperatures in most parts of north and central India are expected to rise from May 20. Under the influence of the present WD, thunderstorm activity is likely over plains of northwest India during the next two days.The low-pressure area over the southeast Bay of Bengal and adjoining south Andaman Sea now lies as “Well Marked Low- Pressure Area”, according to IMD. It is very likely to concentrate into a depression over central parts of south Bay of Bengal on May 15 and further intensify into a cyclonic storm over the same region by May 16 evening. Officials have advised fishermen against venturing into Odisha-West Bengal coasts from May 18 onwards and those out at sea to return.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dust-storms-rain-hit-northwest-india/story-BPqaQ2MDiWtVLzdcSMmDxN.html
14-05-2020||India||India committed to maintaining peace at border: Army on Sikkim face-offs||New Delhi: India on Thursday emphasised the need for peace and tranquillity along the border with China following two clashes between Indian and Chinese troops, saying such incidents occurred because of differing perceptions of the Line of Actual Control (LAC).Amy chief Gen MM Naravane said Indian troops have always upheld peace and tranquillity along the frontier, and the country’s force posture would not suffer because of the Covid-19 pandemic.Indian and Chinese border troops first clashed in eastern Ladakh near Pangong Lake on May 5 and then in north Sikkim last Saturday. Several soldiers on both sides were injured in these incidents, which marked the first major flare-up along the LAC since the 73-day standoff at Doklam in 2017.“The Indian side remains committed to the objective of maintaining peace and tranquillity in the India-China border areas,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava told a regular news briefing via video conference.He noted Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping, during their informal summits at Wuhan in 2018 and Mamallapuram in 2019, had reaffirmed both sides will continue efforts to ensure peace and tranquillity along the border. “This is essential for the overall development of the bilateral relations,” he said.Both the Indian army chief and the external affairs ministry spokesperson pointed out face-offs between border troops along LAC occurred because of differing perceptions of the alignment of boundaries that are not resolved.Navarane described the face-offs as “temporary and short” and said the two incidents resulted in minor injuries to troops following “aggressive behaviour by both sides”. The two sides also “disengaged after dialogue and interaction at [the] local level”, he said.Srivastava said such incidents could have been avoided “if we had a common perception of the LAC”. The two sides have established mechanisms to resolve such situations.The India-China border has “largely been peaceful” as a result of directions from Modi and Xi to their militaries to “earnestly implement various confidence-building measures…including the principle of mutual and equal security, and strengthen existing institutional arrangements and information-sharing mechanisms to prevent incidents in border regions”, Srivastava said.Naravane contended the two clashes were not co-related and had no connection with other global or local activities. “I can say with confidence that the development of infrastructure capabilities along our northern borders is on track. Our force posture will not suffer due to the Covid pandemic.”The Border Roads Organisation is continuing its work amid the Covid-19 pandemic to connect far-flung areas so that civilians in those locations are connected and to facilitate faster development, the army chief said.The face-off at Doklam, which was triggered by China’s efforts to build a road in territory claimed by Bhutan, took India-China relations to a fresh low. It also sparked one of the worst military stand-offs since the 1962 war, and ties returned to an even keel after the first informal summit at Wuhan in 2018. Since New Delhi’s decision to scrap Jammu & Kashmir’s special status last August, China, acting at the behest of its traditional ally Pakistan, has criticised India’s actions in Kashmir several times. China has opposed the division of the state into two union territories. These developments have affected bilateral ties. HT was the first to report on May 10 about intensifying of India-China border tensions in Sikkim, where 150 soldiers were involved in a tense standoff a day earlier. Four Indian and seven Chinese soldiers were injured at Naku La during the confrontation.Scores of soldiers from the two countries clashed in Ladakh on the night of May 5-6, as reported by HT on May 11. A few soldiers from both sides were injured in the scuffle that involved around 250 men, and a flare-up was avoided as both armies stuck to protocols to resolve the situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-committed-to-maintaining-peace-at-border-army-on-sikkim-face-offs/story-VNqX5G7xOYAfx8hRyosZjN.html
14-05-2020||India||Kerala reports spurt in cases after more than a month||Thiruvananthapuram: After maintaining a tight rein for one-and-a-half months, Kerala on Thursday reported a spurt in coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases with 26 new infections, the highest since March-end. Out of the 26 new cases, seven were people who had returned from West Asia and eight from other Indian states , including Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu.chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said. The state, which has built a track record for the highest recovery rate and lowest fatality rate ,is concerned about a further increase in the number of Covid-19 cases after the return of expats from West Asia and an influx from other Indian states. Among Gulf returnees, 22 have tested positive so far and more flights and trains are expected in the coming days. Of the 560 cases Kerala has reported since the outbreak began, 64 are in hospital undergoing treatment; 492 have been discharged. Four Covid-19 deaths have taken place so far in the state, making for a fatality rate that’s less than 1%.“The sudden spurt exposes the lurking threat. We have been insisting for a strict protocol due to this. Many questioned us when we insisted on passes for those coming from other states. It is not time to play politics,” said Vijayan, referring to three Congress MPs and two state legislators who were asked to go into quarantine.MPs Remya Haridas, T N Prathapan and V K Sreekandan and state legislators Anil Akkara and Shafi Parambhil had visited the Kerala- Tamil Nadu border checkpost on May 9 to distribute food and other essentials to people stranded there. The district medical board has asked them to stay in 14 days’ home quarantine after one man they allegedly interacted with tested positive for Covid-19. The MPs described the move as politically motivated but said they will heed the directive of the district administration.“We have given instructions not to arrange any reception to those coming to the state due to the prevailing situation. Despite this, some leaders rushed to the border post and interacted with many. This should have been avoided. It is no time to play politics,” Vijayan said.Kerala pressed the emergency button as the influx from West Asia and other Indian states began. What aggravated its concern is that, other than expatriates based in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), most of the returnees from West Asia haven’t been subjected to thorough medical tests.“It is a critical phase for the state. In last few days we had only single digit cases and some days were free of them. Social distancing, masks and hand hygiene have become part of our life. There is no escape from them now. We have to go by the directives of health officials and I am sure we will overcome this,” said the CM||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-reports-spurt-in-cases-after-more-than-a-month/story-rc8XpyX016Xx8BysKdYjRP.html
14-05-2020||India||Maha cases cross 27k in highest 1-day spike||Mumbai Maharashtra recorded 1,602 new coronavirus cases on Thursday, the state’s highest one-day spike for a second consecutive day, according to official figures released by the government. With the latest increase, the state’s case tally has crossed the 27,000 mark within 14 of going past 10,000 on April 30. Maharasthra’s case count stands at 27,524. Of these, 20,441 are active cases, state health officials said. On Wednesday, the state recorded 1,495 cases, the highest in a single day until then.The death toll in the state crossed the 1,000 mark as 44 fatalities were recorded on Thursday. Of those, 25 were in Mumbai, 10 in Navi Mumbai, five in Pune, two in Aurangabad and one each in Panvel and Kalyan. Of the 44 deaths, 34 patients had co-morbidity conditions, said the officials cited above.Mumbai, the worst-hit city in the country, also recorded its highest one-day spike with 991 cases. It crossed the 16,000 mark and the total case count in the city stands at 16,738. On Sunday, the city recorded 875 cases, which was the highest in a day till then. The death toll of Mumbai breached the 600 mark with 25 fatalities on Thursday. The toll now stands at 621. Officials said this could not be termed as exponential growth and the state had also not reached the community transmission stage.As the Centre is planning more relaxations after May 17, the number of fresh cases is rising rapidly in Maharashtra. For more than a week (from May 6), the state has been getting over 1,000 cases on a daily basis and by the end of this phase of the lockdown (May 17), it is likely to breach the 30,000 mark. In May (14 days) alone, the state has reported as many as 17,026 cases.On May 6, fresh daily cases stood at 1,233, on May 7 at 1,216 cases, on May 8 at 1,089, on May 9 at 1,165, on May 10 at 1,278, on May 11 at 1,230, on May 12 at 1,026 and on May 13 at 1,495.

Between April 19 and 30, the state was getting around 500 new cases on a daily basisDr Tatyarao Lahane, director, Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER), said, “The numbers are rising but it cannot be called exponential growth as in that case the number multiplies on daily cases. If the number of fresh cases becomes double on a daily basis only then can it be called exponential growth.”“The state has also not reached community transmission stage as it comes with exponential growth only,” he added.The first positive case was found on March 9 and it took 30 days for the state to cross the 1,000 mark.As cases are rising, the number of people to have recovered so far rose to 6,059 as 512 positive patients recovered on Thursday.The doubling rate in the state stands at 10 days. The state government has decided to take the rate to 20 days in the days to come, said health minister Rajesh Tope. The government has resolved to bring the entire state in a green zone by this month’s end.So far, 15,465 people have been kept in institutional quarantine in the state and over 315,686 people have been put under home isolation.

14-05-2020||India||Chaos at MP-Maha border as workers rush to return home||Bhopal: Raj Kishore, 42, an employee in a sweet shop in Mumbai for the past five years, set out on Wednesday more than 1200 kilometres to his home in Agra district in Uttar Pradesh when he was informed about the Maharashtra government’s bus service to Maharashtra-Madhya Pradesh border.On Thursday, Kishore along with hundreds of other workers, was waiting for hours for his turn to get a bus at Bijasan, a check-post on MP-Maharashtra border, in Barwani district, 313 kilometres south west of Bhopal. The day’s temperature had climbed to 42 degrees C. He intended to go back either by buses provided by MP government or private vehicles like trucks, taxi, auto-rickshaws etc.According to the MP government, free buses are being provided at the Maharashtra border to take workers to Jhansi in Uttar Pradesh, 650 km away, after a change of buses at Dewas and Guna. Similar arrangements have also been made at other border checkposts since Tuesday when the rush of migrant workers started, the officials said.Those dropped at the border by buses or reaching the border on foot or bicycles have to wait for hours to get a bus..Ram Verma, who had been waiting for least six hours with his wife and two children, 5 and 7 years old, at Bijasan, said, “I stuck around in Mumbai till now but getting stranded without a job meant taking care of my family with no money in hand. At least, I can have something to eat in my village.” He lost his job as a salesman in Mumbai after the lockdown was announced. Om Prakash Mishra from UP’s Jaunpur district, who fixes tiles in buildings under construction in Mumbai, reached Chhindwara, on Thursday morning, in a truck by paying Rs 3,000. “With no job for two months I had run out of money. I requested my family to send money to me for the travel expenses,” he said.A government official in Barwani, which is witnessing migrant labourers from Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, said the rush was unprecedented. “More than 20, 000 to 25, 000 workers are coming daily for several destinations in MP, UP, Bihar, Jharkhand and Rajasthan. We have arranged for about 120 buses. Seeing the rush, we need 200 buses,” he said. “Managing them is becoming very difficult. Many of them are very aggressive. We are not using force as it could lead to law and order situation,” he said. As there are not enough buses, he said, they were trying to arrange trucks and tempos for workers to return home. Sendhwa sub-divisional magistrate, Ghyanshyam Dhangar, said they were trying to arrange more buses as each bus was accommodating no more than 40 workers to maintain social distancing norms.. Kavita Kanesh, in charge of the police outpost in charge at Bijasan, said, “The labourers are desperate to go home. We give them food and water but what gives them the biggest joy is a seat in any bus or any vehicle.” Amit Tomar, district collector, Barwani district, said, “As per the announcement of the chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, we are providing facilities like food, water, and shelter to those labourers who are coming in their own vehicles or through other vehicles and providing the facility of buses to others who are entering Madhya Pradesh on foot from Maharashtra. All the facilities are free. Medical examinations of the labourers are also being conducted.”(With input from Sachin Pandey in Chhindwara and Mayank Bhargva in Betul)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chaos-at-mp-maha-border-as-workers-rush-to-return-home/story-PGqD5R18zYN2VufuKMX27N.html
14-05-2020||India||Mamata declares 105 trains for migrants, Centre says more needed||Kolkata: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, who has faced flak for going slow on the return of migrant workers, on Thursday announced her government has arranged 105 trains to bring them home over the next month even as railway minister Piyush Goyal said the state needed as many trains daily. The Centre and West Bengal government have been at loggerheads over the return of migrants and the Covid-19 management. Banerjee on Monday accused the Centre of trying to gain political mileage amid the pandemic at the expense of her government.“I am pleased to announce that we have arranged 105 additional special trains,” Banerjee tweeted and shared on social media details of their schedule.Goyal responded to Banerjee’s tweet hours later. “I feel sad that while there is a need for 105 trains/day to bring back migrants to WB [West Bengal], the state is accepting only 105 trains over 30 days. I once again hope for the sake of Bengali brothers and sisters in different parts of the country that WB will accept them back with open arms,” he tweeted. “Many migrants want to return to WB & if the State does not accept them then we may find more cases of migrants & even children walking for hundreds of kms & resorting to other dangerous means. WB should speed up setting up of adequate arrangements to receive their own migrants.”Tamil Nadu-based writer Nityanand Jayaraman tweeted a video of a group of workers from Bengal starting for their homes on bicycles, nearly 1,700 km away.Activist Anuradha Talwar, who has been working with stranded migrant workers, said migrants from Bengal were initially against walking or cycling home and preferred to wait. She added they were of late running out of patience.In response to Goyal’s series of tweets, Trinamool Congress national spokesperson Derek O’Brien said : “The railway minister has been all but absent during this monumental crisis when millions of poor migrant workers have been abandoned. They’ve been left to fend for themselves, stuck across the country waiting for some help from the government to safely return to their homes and families. These people could have been moved in a matter of days.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamata-declares-105-trains-for-migrants-centre-says-more-needed/story-TyHPnEMoE9CNP9GPXJ0E5H.html
14-05-2020||India||PM Modi interacts with Bill Gates, discusses global response to Covid-19||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday interacted with philanthropist and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and discussed the global response to Covid-19 and the importance of global coordination on scientific innovation to combat the pandemic. The Prime Minister underlined the conscious approach that India has adopted in its fight against the health crisis - an approach based on ensuring public engagement through appropriate messaging, a PMO release said. He explained how this people-centric bottom-up approach has helped win acceptability for physical distancing, respect for frontline workers, wearing of masks, maintaining proper hygiene, and respecting lockdown provisions. He also highlighted that the previous initiatives taken by Government including expanding financial inclusion, strengthening last-mile delivery of health services, popularising cleanliness and hygiene through the Swachh Bharat Mission and drawing upon India’s Ayurvedic wisdom to enhance people’s immunity, had helped increase the effectiveness of India’s response to the present pandemic. The Prime Minister appreciated the health-related work being done by the Gates Foundation not only in India but also in many other parts of the world, including that for coordinating the global response to Covid-19.He sought suggestions from Gates, who is co-chair, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, on how India’s capacities and capabilities could be better leveraged for the general benefit of the world.Some of the ideas that PM Modi and Gates explored in this context included drawing upon India’s unique model of last-mile health service delivery in rural areas, dissemination of the effective contact-tracing mobile app developed by the government, and above all by leveraging India’s massive pharmaceutical capacity to scale-up the production of vaccines and therapeutics upon their discovery. They agreed that given India’s willingness and capacity to contribute to global efforts, particularly for benefit of fellow developing countries, it was important for India to be included in the ongoing global discussions for coordinating responses to the pandemic.The Prime Minister also suggested that the Gates Foundation could take the lead in analyzing the necessary changes in lifestyles, economic organisation, social behaviour, modes of disseminating education and healthcare, that would emerge in the post-Covid world, and the associated technological challenges that would need to be addressed. He said that India would be happy to contribute to such an analytical exercise based on its own experiences.)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-interacts-with-bill-gates-discusses-global-response-to-covid-19/story-M49hchzrJ0LMXwHtgIULfN.html

The police authorities arrived there to stop vehicular movement on either side. But as the crowds started swelling in the area and taking pictures on their mobiles, it got panicky and suddenly got up. It ran towards one side of the road and jumped into a farmhouse nearby,” he said.While running away from the crowd, the leopard attacked a person, identified as Subhan, a truck driver from East Godavari district in Andhra Pradesh, who was standing on the roadside.“He managed to escape with minor injuries and he was sent to hospital,” Mylardevpalli police inspector K Sathaiah Goud told Hindustan Times.Forest officials from Nehru Zoological Park, which is close by, arrived there with a cage and were making efforts to tranquillise the animal. “There are a large number of trees in the compound of the farmhouse. The forest officials are trying to locate it,” the inspector said.The forest officials deployed drone and trap cameras to spot the leopard’s location. They suspect that the animal might have suffered an injury. “It appears to be a two to three years old cub. We hope it will remain in the present location that is safe. We are trying to ensure that it does not come out to residential colonies,” Goud said.The area is connected to forest area in Narsingi and the sprawling agriculture university campus besides the ICRISAT campus.

14-05-2020||India||Chaos at MP-Maharashtra border as migrants rush to return home||Raj Kishore, 42, has been working in a sweet shop in Mumbai for the past several years. He set out for a long journey to cover a distance of more than 1200 kilometres to his native place in Agra district in Uttar Pradesh when he was told about the Maharashtra government’s bus service to the state border with Madhya Pradesh.On Thursday, Kishore along with hundreds of other workers was waiting for hours braving the scorching heat at 42 degree Celsius for his turn to board a bus at Bijasan, a check-post on the MP-Maharashtra border, in Barwani district, 313 kilometres south west of Bhopal.According to the Madhya Pradesh government, buses are being provided free of cost at the Maharashtra border to take workers to Jhansi in Uttar Pradesh, 650 km away, after change of buses at Dewas and Guna. Similar arrangements have also been made at other border check-posts since Tuesday when the rush of migrant workers started, the officials said.Although on paper the plan looks good, those reaching the border have to wait for hours to get a bus. But, the workers are willing to bear this pain for the assurance of reaching home.Ram Verma, who had been waiting for a bus for at least six hours with his wife and two children, aged 5 and 7 years, at Bijasan, said, “I waited till now but getting stuck any more meant taking care of my family with no money in hand. At least, I can have something to eat in my village.” He lost his job as a salesman in Mumbai after the lockdown was announced. Om Prakash Mishra from UP’s Jaunpur district, who fixes tiles in under construction houses in Mumbai, reached Chhindwara, on Thursday morning, in a truck by paying Rs 3,000. “With no job for two months I had run out of money. I requested my family to send money to me for the travel expenses,” he said.A government official in Barwani, who was not willing to be named, said he has never seen such a rush of migrant workers there and there was total chaos at the border check posts.“More than 20,000 to 25,000 workers are coming daily for several destinations in MP, UP, Bihar, Jharkhand and Rajasthan. We have arranged for about 120 buses. Seeing the rush, we need 200 more buses,” he said.The official said the workers jostle with each other and are even occupying bus floors and roofs. “Managing them is becoming very difficult. Many of them are very aggressive. We are not using force as it could lead to a law and order situation,” he said. As there are not enough buses, he said, they were trying to arrange trucks, tempos and trolleys for workers to return home. “If we don’t provide them with transport, there can be a law and order situation,” he said. Area’s sub-divisional magistrate Ghyanshyam Dhangar accepted there was shortage of buses as they cannot accommodate more than 40 workers in a bus to maintain social distancing norms. Police outpost in-charge at Bijasan, Kavita Kanesh said, “The labourers are desperate to go home. We give them food and water but what gives them the biggest joy is a seat in any bus or any vehicle.” District collector, Barwani district Amit Tomar said, “As per the announcement of chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan we are providing facilities like food, water, shelter to those labourers who are coming in their own vehicles or through other conveyances and providing facility of buses to others who are entering Madhya Pradesh walking from Maharashtra’s border. All the facilities are free. Medical examination of the labourers is also being conducted.”(With inputs from Sachin Pandey in Chhindwara and Mayank Bhargva in Betul).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chaos-at-mp-maharashtra-border-as-migrants-rush-to-return-home/story-LaDlWTiz6kIyvKpEOH90ZL.html

The eight million acre feet reservoir with a height of 272 metres is set to be the world’s tallest roller compact concrete (RCC) dam. Construction work on the dam is expected to begin in a couple of weeks, the Pakistani media reported.Responding to the development, external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said the Gilgit-Baltistan region is part of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir that was illegally occupied by Pakistan.“Our position is consistent and clear that the entire territory of the union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh have been, are, and will continue to be an integral and inalienable part of India,” Srivastava said.“We have consistently conveyed our protest and shared concerns with both China and Pakistan on all such projects in the Indian territories under Pakistan’s illegal occupation,” he said.In the past too, India has opposed projects jointly taken up by Pakistan and China in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir as part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-opposes-pakistan-china-move-to-build-major-dam-in-gilgit-baltistan/story-HgRauxDzd8FjagWbAZaBAM.html

The Karnataka health department had set up ten health check-up counters and passengers were disembarked slowly bogie by bogie.There was heavy deployment of Railway protection force at the station. The DC of Bangalore Urban district G L Shivamurthy said that rooms had been reserved in around 90 hotels near the Majestic railway station. Passengers willing to stay in the hotels had to bear the cost with varying tariffs (depending on facilities) while separate arrangements had been made for those who didn’t wish to stay in hotels. These people had to stay at institutional quarantine facilities at government hostels run by the social welfare department. About 15 BMTC buses were also arranged to ferry the passengers to their respective hotels taking into account social distancing and other hygiene factors.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesHowever, about 50 passengers refused to be quarantined claiming that they had not been informed about the requirement. A video of them standing in a group and chanting ‘no quarantine’ went viral. After much discussion and attempts to convince them by the IGP (Railways) D Roopa failed, she requested the railways to attach an extra bogie and send back those who refuse to be quarantined if they were ready to pay for their tickets.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19Karnataka’s primary and secondary education minister Suresh Kumar was clear that all passengers who come from another state must compulsorily be quarantined for a period of 14 days. “We have communicated this on SMS too, to all ticket holders. However, we understand that in this incident, those who were on the waitlist may have got seats and thus remained uninformed. We were able to convince some of them to go to institutional quarantine and the rest have chosen to go back.”Those who refused to be quarantined are to be sent back on the Rajdhani Express which departs late on Thursday night.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/drama-at-bengaluru-station-as-50-passengers-refuse-quarantine-will-be-sent-back-to-delhi/story-F5SsGtD432CRZ6GuMlQCCJ.html

The Dorf Ketal product will be added into the tanks of the Styrene stored at LG Polymers. This will prevent further degradation and hence another probable gas leak, thereby ensuring the site is safe. The Styrene gas leak incident killed 11 people and forced the evacuation of thousands.ACtify Green Retarder is a new innovative green polymer retardant that is thermally stable and provides excellent protection during unscheduled shutdowns, said the company in a press release. Dorf was asked to provide ACtify 2680, green retarder that is safe to use and handle, and ACtify 2673, a polymerisation inhibitor which is used in Styrene plants. The South Korean chemical giant is working closely with related authorities to analyse the cause of the incident, prevent a recurrence, and support damage recovery in a prompt and expedient manner.On the support measures, the company said a special task force is currently supporting the bereaved victims and families and visiting them at the hospitals and their homes.“We assure everyone we will do our best to resolve the situation and prevent any incident in the future,” the company said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lg-polymers-in-vizag-gets-styrene-inhibitor-to-boost-safety-after-gas-leak/story-LmTtyoQt7ppSNm5GYUdI0N.html

During a media interview, he said that the US wants India to take on a more active role in the Afghan peace process.“We have our own perspectives on Afghanistan and our traditional and neighbourly relations with the people of Afghanistan will continue to guide our Afghan policy,” one of the people cited above said on condition of anonymity.The people indicated that India is yet to decide on the crucial issue of whether to engage with the Taliban.For years, the Indian government has stayed away from any move to engage the Taliban, either directly or indirectly, largely because of concerns related to the terror group’s close links to the Pakistani military establishment.The closest India has come to being at the same table as the Taliban was when New Delhi sent two former ambassadors as “non-official” representatives to a meeting under the Moscow Format mechanism in Russia in November 2018.During their meetings with Khalilzad last week, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval conveyed India’s strong concerns about a spike in terrorist violence in Afghanistan and called for rooting out terror sanctuaries in Pakistan to ensure peace in the war-torn country.“India is deeply concerned at the upsurge in violence and supports call for immediate ceasefire and [the] need to assist the people of Afghanistan in dealing with [the] coronavirus pandemic,” the external affairs ministry said in a statement on Khalilzad’s meetings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-yet-to-decide-on-issue-of-engaging-the-taliban/story-0e6T85ahCNlMHgFgitGgvM.html

Addressing a press conference, Sawant cited the instance of the eighth new patient, who was declared to have been cured of coronavirus after treatment and was quarantined in Mumbai, but reported positive when tested upon entry in Goa. Sawant said he hoped those arriving by trains would strictly adhere to 14-days of home quarantine even if their tests -- taken once they alight -- are reported negative. “As the chief minister of the state, I’m very worried about those who are arriving by trains. I do not know whether they will abide by their home quarantine instructions. Look at the case of the seafarer (the eighth case). He was tested negative and today he has been found positive after fourteen days,” Sawant said. He said he has requested the union railways minister to remove the Margao halt for Kerala bound trains from New Delhi. For Coronavirus Live UpdatesOn Thursday, New Delhi - Thiruvananthapuram special brought 17 passengers to Margao, Goa, and all were found to be negative in tests using rapid RT-PCR tests. The only other resumed train service to Goa is New Delhi-Margao special, which will roll in for the first time on Saturday May 16. The train is expected to bring in 720 persons and will pose a huge challenge for the state administration to test and quarantine all the arrivals. The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19Sawant, however, said that the trains could not be stopped since stranded people needed to go home. According to the registrations on the Goa government web portal, around 6,200 Goa residents stranded across the country are seeking to return, apart from 8,211 people from abroad. Besides these, 3,842 seafarers are stranded abroad onboard various ships, wanting to return. Goa’s Covid-19 total has now risen to 15, eight of whom are active cases detected over the last 24-hours, including a one-year-old girl, four other members of her family, their driver, a lorry driver and a seafarer. Sawant has however ruled out imposing restrictions on movement within or from outside the state arguing that there was little threat of community transmission since all cases were “imported” and restrictions on the movement of goods would affect the state. “We are testing all those entering the state except the truck drivers who are only screened for symptoms,” Sawant said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-arrivals-rise-so-do-goa-s-worries-8-new-entrants-test-positive-in-24-hours/story-x1dpxYM3zGRGqSUsKAg3xJ.html

14-05-2020||India||ICMR issues revised guidance document on rapid antibody test kits for Covid-19||The ICMR on Thursday issued revised guidance document on rapid antibody test kits for COVID-19 and listed the firms whose kits have been validated and found satisfactory.The apex health research body had issued on Wednesday night a guidance document in which two Chinese firms -- Guangzhou Wondfo Biotech and Zhuhai Livzon Diagnostics -- whose importer’s licenses were cancelled by the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation last month, found a mention among the list of companies, test kits of whose, have been validated at the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune so far.The document, however, was taken down from the website in the morning and a revised one was uploaded later.The revised document also mentions the two Chinese firms, but states that “the marketing licenses to the distributors of these two companies have been cancelled by the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO).” The health research body, however, underlined that such rapid antibody test are not recommended for diagnosis of coronavirus infection. It had earlier said that such test kits are to be used only for surveillance purpose.“Till date, 42 antibody-based rapid tests have been validated, and the following were found to be satisfactory. Ten of these kits are manufactured in India,” the ICMR said in the revised guidance document.“These rapid antibody test kits have been validated in the laboratory. However, the performance of the kits may be subject to variation under field conditions,” the ICMR underlined.   According to the guidance document, the rapid tests can be done on blood/serum/plasma samples and the result is available within 30 minutes.“The test may remain positive for several weeks after infection. A positive test indicates exposure to SARS-CoV-2 while a negative test does not rule out COVID-19 infection,” the ICMR said.The list of kits includes COVID-19 IgM IgG Rapid Test: BioMedomics (CE-IVD); New Coronavirus (COVID-19) IgG/IgM Rapid Test: Voxtur Bio Ltd, India; Makesure COVID-19 Rapid test: HLL Lifecare Limited, Indi; Abchek COVID-19 IgM/IgG Antibody Rapid Test: NuLifecare and; One Step COVID-19 IgM/IgG Antibody: SIDAK Life Care Pvt. Ltd. The list also mentions the batch numbers of the kits.The Centre on April 27 had said that it has “not lost a single rupee” with respect to the supplies of the COVID-19 rapid antibody test kits while cancelling the shipment of the equipment from two Chinese companies after those were found to be “under-performing”. In an advisory sent to chief secretaries of all states and Union Territories, the ICMR had said that it “evaluated the kits of Guangzhou Wondfo Biotech and Zhuhai Livson Diagnostics in field conditions. The results have shown wide variation in their sensitivity, despite an early promise of good performance for surveillance purpose”.The testing technique is used to detect antibodies in the blood of people who may have had novel coronavirus infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/icmr-issues-revised-guidance-document-on-rapid-antibody-test-kits-for-covid-19/story-lzfap0MKaVg445pP7FJZ2M.html

With lockdown restrictions set to be eased, Dr Trehan, speaking exclusively to Hindustan Times, said the country needs hygiene, masking and social distancing.Watch| Lockdown 4 and how India should live with the virus: Dr. Naresh Trehan answers “To fight this war, we need to behave ourselves, by changing our social behaviour pattern. Hands hygiene, masking, and distancing. We will be able to contain this menace, if we behave responsibly,” said Dr Trehan.If the advice is not heeded, the doctor warned, the repercussions could be disastrous. “We will have a spread which will be unmanageable given our population,” said the doctor.He said there should be a constant “hammering of the fact that the only way to survive this is to act responsibly”. On the question of restarting the economic activity, Dr Trehan said it should be done in a “calibrated” manner.“We are at a juncture where economic activity must be opened , and opened gradually in a calibrated manner with monitoring,” he said. Talking about the serpentine queues seen outside liquor shops, Dr Trehan said the states must pitch in too and play their part. He said there will be confusion, but it should not turn to chaos.On the migrants’ situation, the doctor urged the Centre to make a “cohesive plan”. “If you decide to send them back, then make it possible for them to go back. We still see people walking on the streets. We must manage ourselves properly. We must have a cohesive thinking. It’s heart wrenching,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hygiene-masking-distancing-dr-trehan-s-mantra-to-fight-coronavirus/story-DAK4rZ9EGPqf7TOQAHyUhP.html
14-05-2020||India||India highlights need for peace and tranquillity on border with China following clashes||India on Thursday emphasised the need for peace and tranquillity along the border with China following two clashes between Indian and Chinese troops, saying such incidents occurred because of differing perceptions of the Line of Actual Control (LAC).Amy chief Gen MM Naravane said Indian troops have always upheld peace and tranquillity along the frontier, and the country’s force posture would not suffer because of the Covid-19 pandemic.Indian and Chinese border troops first clashed in eastern Ladakh near Pangong Lake on May 5 and then in north Sikkim last Saturday. Several soldiers on both sides were injured in these incidents, which marked the first major flare-up along the LAC since the 73-day standoff at Doklam in 2017.“The Indian side remains committed to the objective of maintaining peace and tranquillity in the India-China border areas,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava told a regular news briefing via video conference.He noted Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping, during their informal summits at Wuhan in 2018 and Mamallapuram in 2019, had reaffirmed both sides will continue efforts to ensure peace and tranquillity along the border. “This is essential for the overall development of the bilateral relations,” he said.Both the Indian army chief and the external affairs ministry spokesperson pointed out face-offs between border troops along LAC occurred because of differing perceptions of the alignment of boundaries that are not resolved.Navarane described the face-offs as “temporary and short” and said the two incidents resulted in minor injuries to troops following “aggressive behaviour by both sides”. The two sides also “disengaged after dialogue and interaction at [the] local level”, he said.Srivastava said such incidents could have been avoided “if we had a common perception of the LAC”. The two sides have established mechanisms to resolve such situations.The India-China border has “largely been peaceful” as a result of directions from Modi and Xi to their militaries to “earnestly implement various confidence-building measures…including the principle of mutual and equal security, and strengthen existing institutional arrangements and information-sharing mechanisms to prevent incidents in border regions”, Srivastava said.Naravane contended the two clashes were not co-related and had no connection with other global or local activities. “I can say with confidence that the development of infrastructure capabilities along our northern borders is on track. Our force posture will not suffer due to the Covid pandemic.”The Border Roads Organisation is continuing its work amid the Covid-19 pandemic to connect far-flung areas so that civilians in those locations are connected and to facilitate faster development, the army chief said.The face-off at Doklam, which was triggered by China’s efforts to build a road in territory claimed by Bhutan, took India-China relations to a fresh low. It also sparked one of the worst military stand-offs since the 1962 war, and ties returned to an even keel after the first informal summit at Wuhan in 2018. Since New Delhi’s decision to scrap Jammu & Kashmir’s special status last August, China, acting at the behest of its traditional ally Pakistan, has criticised India’s actions in Kashmir several times. China has opposed the division of the state into two union territories. These developments have affected bilateral ties. HT was the first to report on May 10 about intensifying of India-China border tensions in Sikkim, where 150 soldiers were involved in a tense standoff a day earlier. Four Indian and seven Chinese soldiers were injured at Naku La during the confrontation.Scores of soldiers from the two countries clashed in Ladakh on the night of May 5-6, as reported by HT on May 11. A few soldiers from both sides were injured in the scuffle that involved around 250 men, and a flare-up was avoided as both armies stuck to protocols to resolve the situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-highlights-need-for-peace-and-tranquillity-on-border-with-china-following-clashes/story-a7LJyIsMOREpxXAQPCWlEL.html

The first phase, which mostly focused on West Asian countries, has 64 flights.“There will be more flights and more destinations in the second phase. We are looking to bring back about 32,000 people,” said one of the people cited above, who spoke on condition of anonymity.About 15,000 citizens are expected to be repatriated from 12 countries during the first phase of Vande Bharat Mission, which will end on May 15, and 56 flights have already brought back more than 12,000 Indian nationals.An additional 904 Indians were repatriated from the Maldives by two Indian warships on May 10 and 12, and some more nationals arrived in the country on deportation flights from various countries.The people said requests from OCI card holders can be considered after the government meets the minimum expectations of its Indian nationals seeking to return home. Embassies in West Asian countries are also in touch with stakeholders following offers from private firms to repatriate Indian workers who had been laid off, they said.So far, a total of 188,646 Indian nationals have registered with the external affairs ministry to return, and priority will be given to those with compelling reasons for repatriation, such as workers laid off due to the pandemic, pregnant women, and people with medical emergencies.“An additional 18 countries are covered under the second phase, including Indonesia, Thailand, Australia, Italy, France, Germany, Ireland, Canada, Japan, Nigeria, Kazakhstan and Ukraine. We are broadening the ambit of Vande Bharat Mission every week in a phased manner, in line with our quarantine capacity and health protocols,” said external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava.He described Vande Bharat Mission as the largest and most complex exercise undertaken by the government for repatriating citizens stranded abroad, for which the external affairs ministry is working closely with the ministries of civil aviation, home and health and state governments.Referring to the deployment of the warship INS Kesari for Mission Sagar, an operation to provide medical aid and supplies to the Maldives, Mauritius, Madagascar, Comoros and Seychelles, Srivastava said the vessel is currently docked at Male to offload 550 tonnes of food supplies.

14-05-2020||India||Migration toll continues to rise, 15 die, nearly 100 injured road accidents||Fifteen migrant workers on their way back to their homes were killed in three accidents, one each in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar in the past 24 hours, police officials said.They added that close to 100 were also injured in road accidents across states on Thursday, as migrant workers continue to seek rides on trucks, cycle, or just walk on the country’s highways to return home. The government, starting May 1, announced special trains for migrant workers, but there are still far too few of them and far too many workers wanting to return home. Some of the workers do not have documentation required to travel; others have not registered for the trains or buses being run. Millions of workers were left without work across cities and towns in India when the lockdown was announced on March 24, resulting in the first wave of workers going back to their villages. Every phase of the extension has seen a new wave -- the lockdown was extended twice, from April 14 to May 3 and then May 3 to May 17. On May 8, 16 workers sleeping on rail tracks were run over by a goods train in Maharashtra’s Aurangabad district. On May 9, five workers were killed in Madhya Pradesh’s Narsinghpur district when the truck in which they were travelling hit the central verge of the road. Late on Wednesday night, six labourers, who were walking from Punjab to their village in Gopalganj, Bihar, were killed and four others were seriously injured when a Uttar Pradesh Road Transport bus ran over them on the Saharanpur-Muzaffarnagar highway.Dr Vineet Kaushik of Muzaffarnagar district hospital confirmed that 10 people were brought in and six of them were declared dead. In Madhya Pradesh’s Guna, eight migrant labourers, travelling in a truck from Mumbai to Unnao in Uttar Pradesh, were killed and 55 others were injured when a bus rammed into their truck early Thursday, police said.Guna district Superintendent of police Tarun Nayak said, “Eight of the labourers were killed on the spot and the injured have been hospitalised. Once discharged, they will be sent to their homes in buses.”Mahendra Pal, one of the injured workers said, “The truck driver demanded Rs 3,000 per person. However, the amount was to be paid after reaching our destinations.” Another traveller, Mohd Sibu, said, “I asked for money from my family as I had no money left with me. We got the truck at Thane (Maharashtra).”Madhya Pradesh home minister Narottam Mishra said, “The state has issued instructions to the authorities to make all arrangements for the treatment of labourers.”In Bihar, a migrant worker was killed and 27 others were injured in an accident Samastipur district. Police said a bus carrying 44 migrants collided with a truck on Thursday. All the injured were taken to Sadar hospital were two of them are said to be in serious condition.In Odisha, at least 15 migrant workers were injured, four of them seriously after the minibus in which they were travelling, crashed into a tree in Angul district on Wednesday night, hours after authorities arranged the bus for them. Police officials said they had stopped the 15 migrants walking towards Purinakote area of Keonjhar district from Palasa in Andhra Pradesh and arranged the bus for them.In all, the government officials in states have confirmed death of 109 migrant workers on roads during 50 days of the lockdown so far.

He said out of 26, seven were middle-east returnees and eight came from other states including Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu.The state’s worst fears of a steep rise in cases with the fresh wave of residents returning from the Gulf countries and other states have come true. 22 people returning from the middle-east have tested positive so far and the number is likely to go up even further with more flights expected in the coming days.“The sudden spurt exposes the lurking threat. We have been insisting for a strict protocol due to this. Many questioned us when we insisted for passes for those coming from other states. It is not the time to play politics,” said the CM taking a dig at three Congress MPs and two legislators who were asked to proceed on quarantine.MPs Remya Haridas, T N Prathapan and V K Sreekandan and legislators Anil Akkara and Shafi Parambhil had visited the Kerala- Tamil Nadu border checkpost on May 9 to distribute food and other essentials to the stranded people. The district medical board has asked them to proceed on a 14-day home quarantine after one of the youths they allegedly interacted with tested positive. The MPs later dubbed the move as “politically-motivated” but said they will go by the directive of the district administration.“We have given instructions not to arrange any reception for those coming to the state due to the prevailing situation. Despite this, some leaders rushed to the border post and interacted with many. This should have been avoided. It is no time to play politics,” he said. But the MPs said it was a politically- laced move.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19“We will go by the directive of the administration. But we suspect some foul play in this. The youth collapsed in the morning and when TV channels reported this, we went there in the afternoon. He was tested positive on May 11. We feel it is a move aimed at cornering us,” said Palakkad MP V K Sreekandan adding the CPI (M) district committee had raised a demand to send him and others in quarantine two days ago. For Coronavirus Live UpdatesThe state, which is maintaining a healthy graph with high recovery and low mortality rates, pressed the emergency button as the exodus of expatriates from middle-eastern countries and other states began. The fact that most of the returnees from Arab nations other than the United Arab Emirates (UAE) were not tested before starting journey has aggravated concerns.“It is a critical phase for the state. In the last few days, we had only single-digit cases and some days were free of cases. Social distancing, masks and hand-hygiene have become part of our life. There is no escape from them now. We have to go by the directives of health officials and I am sure we will overcome this,” said the CM.Kerala has a total of 560 positive cases, including 64 active cases under treatment in hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-s-worst-fears-come-true-with-gulf-returnees-driving-a-big-spike-in-covid-19-cases/story-kwtEDbxwl64JeqfsL66SJK.html

In the letter, Ibramhim and Jabbar pointed out that Muslims all over the state had not been able to offer namaz in mosques due to the Covid-19 pandemic and suggested that on at least on Eid, the government offer permission to offer prayers at mosques Idagah Maidans till 1 pm in the afternoon. Mosques across the country have been shut since the lockdown began.The state government was yet to officially react to the request but the minister for Rural Development and Panchayati Raj K S Eshwarappa hit out at Ibrahim saying “We already know what the support of the likes of Siddaramiah, Ibrahim and Zameer Ahmed Khan has done to Tablighis who returned to the state. Law is the same for everybody and all communities.”Ibrahim defended his demand saying that the community has till now followed government orders to offer namaz at home rather than mosques but Eid was an important festival and that all precautions including consultation with medical experts could be done by the government before granting permission.Karnataka recorded 28 new cases of Covid-19 on Thursday to take its tally to 987.

Along with her husband Naresh and children Tanu and Pradeep, she started walking from Jaipur towards their village in Madhya Pradesh on Thursday.“Chhattarpur Jila, Gram Maharajanpurva, post Bachhaun,” Naresh said, his eyes sparkling with the mention of his birthplace again and again. It doesn’t matter if it is a good 700 km away and they are on foot. The 25-year-old man is a skilled labourer and worked with a contractor for a government project before the lockdown and his wife is expecting a child soon.He said he registered on the e-mitra for interstate travel on May 2 but after getting no response for 12 days, the family decided to hit the highway on foot. “Kisi ko jaante nahin Jaipur mein... paisa bhi khatam ho gaya,” said the 25-year-old man.The shade from a huge bag perched on his head envelopes his sweating face. He shows the 12-digit token number generated by e-mitra portal where people wishing to travel register for permission. The token number scribbled on a paper is folded neatly and kept in the pocket of his shirt.Naresh looks hopefully towards the highway for a ride but the vehicles passing by are few and they do not stop. After they pass, mingled sounds of anklets and rubber slippers of Malti scrapping the scorching charcoal can be clearly heard as she totters along. While 5-year-old Pradeep adjusts his toy goggles and the mask he put on especially for the long walk home, they have just reached Paldi Meena near Kanota.Also Read: 1,700 km cycle journey from Chennai underlines limitations of Bengal’s plan to bring migrants homeJaipur district collector Joga Ram said the administration has set up camps for workers walking on highways. “We have requested them not to walk.

14-05-2020||India||First responders: The police story in the fight against Covid-19 in Kasargod||The “triple lock” containment strategy used by the police in Kerala’s Kasaragod district to contain Covid-19 could be the perfect example of how the expertise of cops in surveillance and investigations as well as their familiarity of an area and connect with the community can play an important role in managing a pandemic.Local police is not only the first responder to any disaster but it is the key department for helping civil administration in arranging resources as well as maintaining law and order while continuing its routine schedule at police stations.In fact, a research paper by the Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPRD), a think-tank of ministry of home affairs, written by 1982 batch Bihar cadre IPS officer Paras Nath Rai, says, “Police has a major role in disaster management. As police will continue to have the first responder role given its proximity to the incident site it has to bring about a change in its approach. It has to adopt disaster management function as a primary role and not as a side work”.Rai argued that the local police must be “trained, equipped and supported with legislation and logistics so that they find themselves capable to support the victim in the golden hour”.While response of most of the state police forces’ has been appreciated for the past two months in implementing the Covid-19 lockdown barring few incidents of violence against migrant labourers and misunderstanding the government orders on movement of essential items, Kasargod police’s strategy has particularly been touted as most effective.One of the main features of Kasargod’s police strategy was to monitor the movements of Covid-19 patients and their primary and secondary contacts and for which they used an application – CovidSafety, and not Aarogya Setu.The CovidSafety app has been extremely helpful in detecting violation of home quarantine by people as it alerts the police if the quarantined person moves 50 meters away from his location, according to Inspector General of Police and Commissioner of Police Kochi – Vijay Sakhare.Kasargod was one of the first districts to have reported Covid-19. Sakhare says ‘triple-lock’ strategy is a combination of professional policing techniques and innovative use to technology. The police used traditional methods to restrict movement of all people residing in the district by putting barricades, and human surveillance by deploying officers outside residence of patients, and several apps for tracing, delivery of essentials and medicines. Some of the platforms launched by Kasargod police include – CovidSaftey app for contact tracing, which Sakhare said most of the people downloaded; “Swaraksha Kasargode” – for free medical consultation and ambulances and “Amrutham” – for home delivery of essential items by the police apart from drones. The district reported 92% less cases by the end of April due to this strategy.The Kochi police commissioner says the triple lock strategy has been scaled up to cover the new returnees to the state after the Centre and state governments have opened up the borders. He adds that “home quarantine is no quarantine” unless affected persons stay inside. “The possibility of these persons spreading infection to other family members and the community is very real,” Sakhare says. Delhi Police Commissioner S N Shrivastava says “No civil administration can think of managing an epidemic without the help of police because of its authority it has in the community. Be it implementing the lockdown or managing security of quarantine centres and containment zones, hospitals, movement of migrant labourers, supply of essentials and giving permissions, all these are the strengths of police. Managing a disaster of this scale while continuing the regular police work is a challenge too but then it’s our first duty to serve the people”.Former Delhi Police chief Neeraj Kumar agrees with Shrivastava. “Police have to do everything in such situations despite the fact that they are most vulnerable to infection. The Covid-19 pandemic has also brought out the human side of the police”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/first-responders-the-police-story-in-the-fight-against-covid-19-in-kasargod/story-azjf2uHOLEokSsYI9ukBVN.html
14-05-2020||India||1,700 km cycle journey from Chennai underlines limitations of Bengal’s plan to bring migrants home||On Thursday, Tamil Nadu-based writer and social activist Nityanand Jayaraman posted on Twitter a short video of a batch of migrant workers from Bengal starting for their home on bicycles, embarking on a nearly 1,700 km journey.This was barely a few hours before Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee - who has been facing flak from the opposition for allegedly going slow on bringing back migrant workers - announced that the state had arranged for 105 trains to bring these workers home. People stranded across the country, however, seem to have lost hope.“#MigrantsOnTheRoad Chennai Kolkata Highway. This batch of 20 left Chennai this morning for Murshidabad, WB. 1700 km. No help from govts. Public public partnership only. Courtesy Lorry drivers, dhaba balas, people of India,” Jayaraman wrote on Twitter.In Bengal, right to food activist Anuradha Talwar, who has been working with stranded migrant workers in different states over the past few weeks, said migrants from Bengal were initially against the idea of walking or cycling back home and preferred to wait but are now running out of patience.“We are in touch with these workers and most from Bengal were in favour of waiting for train services to resume. Too few from Bengal actually took to the road to walk or cycle hundreds of kilometres. But they are running out of patience due to lack of clarity over the state government’s initiatives and have started making their own arrangements,” said Talwar.The number of workers from Bengal who migrate to other states is estimated to be around 12 lakh. They mostly go to the southern states of Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka and the western states of Maharashtra and Gujarat. Most of them work in the construction, zari, restaurant, sugar mill, jewelry and the garment sector.Bengal has so far seen a very few people return from distant states on their own, whereas, people did return in groups on their own from the neighbouring states of Jharkhand and Odisha.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19Among those who travelled several hundred kilometres on their own, was a group of construction workers from Chhattisgarh who walked and hitched rides, a middle-aged man from Tamil Nadu and a septuagenarian from Bihar who cycled the distance.“I gave my mobile phone to a security guard at the construction site where I worked in exchange for his bicycle and a few hundred rupees. I rode throughout the day and sometimes at night too. I took rest only when I could not take the pain anymore,” said Atiul Shah, a 23-year-old resident of South 24 Parganas district in Bengal, who returned from Salem in Tamil Nadu on April 29. As on Thursday, 10 trains have brought back stranded migrant worker and pilgrims and several buses have brought back students stranded in Kota, Rajasthan.Mamata Banerjee, however, has blamed other states for the plight of the migrant workers. “No one stranded in our state is getting mad to go back because we have truly treated them as our guests. But people from Bengal who got stranded in other states did not receive this gesture. We appeal to those who are returning not to go back to those states that did not take care of them in this crisis. We’ll make some arrangements for them,” Banerjee said.The first four of the 105 special trains that Banerjee on Thursday tweeted to have arranged, are expected to arrive with migrants from Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru and Hyderabad on Sunday. While one will reach Howrah, the rest three will go to Malda and New Cooch Behar stations.“More than one lakh people have already returned. This includes migrant labourers, tourists, patients and students. The most, around 90,000, came on buses while some arranged their own vehicles to reach the state borders. Some came on foot,” said Banerjee.Opposition parties, however, accused Banerjee of being apathetic towards the migrants. “We are fed up appealing to her. Every appeal falls on deaf ears,” said Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, leader of the Congress in the Lok Sabha.Bharatiya Janata Party state unit president Dilip Ghosh made the same allegation. “We have given the government a list of more than 4,00,000 migrant workers stranded in different states,” Ghosh said.Some workers who were fortunate to get on board trains are unhappy with the arrangements made by the railways. On Thursday, a section of the passengers who came from Bengaluru on a New Jalpaiguri-bound Shramik Special train alleged that they faced an acute shortage of drinking water and food. They also alleged that no social distancing was maintained on the train.Special train reaches Bengaluru from Delhi, passengers to undergo 14-day quarantineMore than 50 passengers on this train got down at Durgapur where the train stopped briefly to change the engine. They staged a protest. Later, the railway authorities had to coordinate with the state government to arrange buses for these passengers. The train was sanitized and drinking water was supplied.The government has stuck to its stand that it would not allow a large number of workers to enter the state at one go. “We will do it in a staggered manner to ensure the virus does not spread to new areas. Every person needs to be screened and we are planning for the return of every single person,” said chief secretary Rajiva Sinha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/1-700-km-cycle-journey-from-chennai-underlines-limitations-of-bengal-s-plan-to-bring-migrants-home/story-qJUeVDPKoZii1u2YC2RvvO.html
14-05-2020||India||US vs China over Covid-19 goes up a notch ahead of WHO meet. Round 2 over Taiwan||Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the World Health Organisation director general who has been blocking darts hurled at him over the global health agency’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, has landed himself at centre of another bout of shadow boxing between the United States and China over letting Taiwan attend next week’s World Health Assembly as an observer.The self-ruled island, which Beijing considers a wayward province awaiting reunification, has been excluded from WHO membership due to objections from China.Taiwan attended the World Health Assembly as a non-voting observer from 2009 to 2016. But Beijing has blocked Taipei’s representation at the event after a China skeptic, Tsai Ing-wen was elected president in 2016. She was re-elected this year and is due to begin her second term on 20 May, two days after the WHA’s 18 May meet.More than a dozen countries have proposed resolutions for the WHO to let Taiwan attend the World Health Assembly as an observer, arguing that the world needed to hear Taiwan that has been held up as a model in fighting the virus first detected in central China’s Wuhan last year.The disease has since then killed 2,97,000 people, infected over 4 million, grounded the world economy and set off a back and forth between the United States, China and WHO’s Tedros.Taiwan has had just about 400 cases and 7 deaths.Also Read: WHO chief Tedros unbowed amid attacks, Donald Trump’s criticismTo be sure, this will not be the first time that an attempt has been made to restore Taiwan’s observer status for the World Health Assembly.Fourteen member states had proposed Taiwan’s inclusion as an observer at WHO’s last annual meet on 28-29 May 2019. The WHO had then cited “procedure followed in previous years” to let two of them speak in favour of the resolution and two against before the general assembly delivered its ruling.Apart from China, Cuba had opposed Taiwan’s inclusion. Eswatini in southern Africa and Honduras in central America had spoken in favour.Diplomats in Geneva and Washington told Hindustan Times that the effort this time was to lobby for other countries to speak too. The chorus is growing, one of them said.Already, fence-sitter Canada has backed Taiwan’s claim to be allowed to participate at the WHA meet apart from other countries such as Australia, Japan, Germany, France, the UK, Australia, New Zealand and the US that is fronting this campaign.A report in the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation’s CBS News said Canada had, for the first time, even gone to the extent of issuing a verbal demarche to two senior WHO executives asking that Taiwan be admitted as an observer to the Monday meeting because its input would be “meaningful and important.”Also Read: Need a reformed WHO| HT EditorialChinese diplomats have been on an overdrive over the coronavirus diseases, initially to play down the havoc that the Sars-CoV-2 virus could wreck on the world. And later when the situation became manageable back home, to even jeer at countries that were struggling with containing its fallout if they underscored transparency and accountability from the WHO or Beijing.Where it could, it has also penalised critics. Like when Australia supported the US call for a probe into the origin of the virus, Chinese authorities threatened to impose heavy duties on barley imports and went ahead to suspend beef imports from four Australian suppliers.Indian hasn’t taken a stand on Taiwan’s inclusion yet. But one government official noted how Beijing, that wants the world to acknowledge its ‘one China’ principle, didn’t demonstrate respect for India’s sovereignty when it comes to Kashmir, or building the China Pakistan Economic Border through Indian territory occupied by Islamabad.It is not clear if senior minister Nitin Gadkari’s comment in an interview to NDTV that the virus that causes coronavirus disease was an off-the-cuff remark or an indicator that the government has an open mind on the origin of the disease.

They cried in pain on several nights and compromised with hunger on many occasions.On a few lucky days, they received sympathy from policemen and truck drivers, who helped shorten their journey by giving them a lift in their vehicles.“We worked at a construction site in Navi Mumbai where work came to a standstill after the announcement of the lockdown. We were surviving on the money we had saved. Gradually, the virus started spreading and ration shops closed down. Then, we had two options – either face the disease on an empty stomach or walk home,” said 31-year-old Hembrom.Another worker who made the journey with Hembrom, Sahil Kumar Gaud, said they could not sleep for several nights because of fears they might not see their families again. “We decided to go back home on foot. Initially, we had doubts but we had no option,” he said.After leaving their accommodation on May 2, they walked for nine hours from 3 am to noon on the first day, resulting in blisters on Hembrom’s feet. “He was in extreme pain from the first day,” Gaud said.“Sometimes, we used to be frustrated thinking we won’t reach our home, as the simmering heat was a major obstacle in our journey,” he added.Every day, Gaud said, they started their trek at 4 am and walked till noon. “After taking some rest under a tree or at petrol pumps, we walked again from 3 pm till 9 pm. On several nights, we cried in pain but we had no other option.”Gaud said, “Sometimes, we would eat using the little money we had left at roadside dhabas and sometimes, social workers would feed us.” He further said, “At some places, police stopped us. But after hearing our story, they put us in their vehicles and helped us shorten the journey. At some places, truck drivers helped us shorten the journey.“The trek was the toughest in Chhattisgarh, where we got no help, excluding food. We had to cross the entire state on foot. No vehicles helped us in the state,” he added.The seven men reached Chaibasa at 9 pm on Wednesday, and were screened by the local administration and sent to home quarantine.Despite the buses and trains organised by the government, thousands of migrant workers have been going home on foot or bicycle. The workers alleged they had no information about the train or bus services when they left the places where they were working.Chief Minister Hemant Soren, in a statement issued on Thursday, said the state government is making efforts to bring back 685,000 stranded Jharkhand residents in a systematic manner by coordinating with the railways and the Central government. He requested opposition party leaders to urge the Central government to arrange more trains for workers from Jharkhand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/seven-migrant-workers-walk-1-800-km-from-mumbai-to-reach-home-in-chaibasa/story-tpe7OL6jzdIm4gSpzZ4MhM.html
14-05-2020||India||Coronavirus crisis: Reverse migration gives hope to north Bengal tea gardens||With thousands of workers returning to West Bengal as a result of migrants exodus during nationwide lockdown to combat the coronavirus pandemic outbreak, the tea gardens in the Darjeeling hill region and other north Bengal districts are hoping to be able to tide over the shortage of workforce witnessed in recent years.A large section of tea garden labourers - who are paid Rs 176 a day at the 283 tea gardens of the region - left their jobs in recent years and went to other states in search of greener pastures. These workers still exist on the payroll of the tea companies as “absentees.”The tea industry in north Bengal requires around three lakh workers to ensure optimal operation. R P Thapliyal, chairman, Tea Association of India, north Bengal unit, said the daily shortage in manpower hovers around 30 per cent.The migration to other states resulted in a shortage of workers with planters finding it difficult to carry out maintenance jobs such as cleaning weeds and pruning tea bushes. To overcome this, planters are forced to hire local people from outside the industry. This leads to additional expenditure.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19Planters said the manpower-shortage factor affected the recent harvesting of first flush tea, the most premium product, and it was made worst due to the enforcement of social distancing norms. S K Lama, general secretary, Himalayan Plantation Workers’ Union, which is affiliated to the Gorkha National Liberation Front, said, “Tea gardens can employ people returning from other states. They used to work in these tea gardens till recently. The trade unions will demand their absorption.”A senior workers’ welfare officer from a garden owned by a nationally known company said, “Some people have already applied for jobs in our garden in the Dooars region. We are forced to hire workers from outside the industry. If the migrant labourers are declared medically fit, then there should be no problem in allowing them in. After all, they are already trained.”A planter in the Darjeeling hills, who did not wish to be named, said, “Once the government allows us to operate with full strength we will hire many of these home-bound workers.”J B Tamang, a senior leader of Darjeeling Terai Dooars Plantation Labour Union (DTDPLU), affiliated to the Binoy Tamang faction of the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM), said “Some gardens are operating with only 50 per cent manpower. The workers left because the wages in the gardens is lower than what some industries offer in other states.”The returnees, however, have an obstacle to cross before they can find work again at the tea gardens, according to Ram Avtar Sharma, secretary, Tea Association of India.“These people are absentees and some disciplinary action has already been initiated against them. The labour laws will follow their own course. Future will decide whether they will be employed, but there is hope.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-crisis-reverse-migration-gives-hope-to-north-bengal-tea-gardens/story-ibLgfVBQJph2a2UWzVHDPM.html

The duo was produced before a special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court, which remanded them to ED’s custody till May 24.A single-judge bench Bombay high court (HC), comprising Justice Bharati Dangre, on Tuesday had rejected the Wadhawans’ anticipatory bail plea and said that custodial interrogation was needed because of the serious nature of allegations such as money laundering and the accused had entered into a conspiracy with several others, including Yes Bank promoter Rana Kapoor and his family members.The judge said that only the applicants can shed light on the nature of the transactions and the alleged conspiracy could be cracked after their interrogation.ED had initiated proceedings against the Wadhawans based on a first information report (FIR) registered by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on March 7 against Kapoor for conspiracy, cheating and under relevant provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act.It is alleged that between April and June 2018, Yes Bank invested Rs 3,700 crore in short-term, non-convertible debentures of DHFL and Kapoor received Rs 600 crore as kickbacks from DHFL, in the form of loan advanced to two firms, DOIT Urban Ventures (India) Private Limited and Morgan Credits Private Limited. While Kapoor’s daughters hold 100℅ stakes in DOIT, Morgan Credits is controlled by his wife. ED also alleged that the Wadhawans had formed at least 79 companies to siphon off money.Additional solicitor general Anil Singh, appearing on behalf of ED, opposed the pleas and stated that the debentures were not yet redeemed by DHFL and Yes Bank had not received its amount back. He added that DHFL has extended a loan of Rs 600 crore to the firms controlled by Kapoor’s family by showing grossly overvalued properties. ED officials said that it had served the summons to the Wadhawans to cooperate with them and to appear before the last week of March, but they did not cooperate. The agency also said that the claims of lockdown restrictions do not hold because if they could travel to Mahabaleshwar, they could have visited the ED office as well.The Wadhawans, along with a group of 23 people, had flouted the prevailing lockdown restrictions and travelled to Mahabaleshwar from Khandala on April 8. The family had managed to leave Mumbai on the permission letter issued by senior state government officials, which is under investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-arrests-kapil-and-dheeraj-wadhawan-in-yes-bank-money-laundering-case/story-5ruy9FPxpuhmmGaeSbenrK.html

Fishermen and Animal husbandry farmers will also be included in this drive,” the finance minister said.This move by the Centre will enable farmers to gain access to institutional credit at concessional interest rate. Across the country about 2.5 crore farmers will be covered and will benefit from credit flow of about Rs 2 lakh crore. At least, 25 lakh new Kisan Credit Cards are in the pipeline for small and marginal farmers, the minister indicated.ALSO READ | Free food grain supply for 8 crore migrants for next 2 months: Nirmala SitharamanGovernment agency NABARD will also extend additional re-finance support of Rs 30,000 crore for crop loan requirement which farmers can avail through Rural Co-operative banks and RRBs.“Interest subvention and prompt repayment incentive on crop loans due from March 1 has been extended to May 31,” the finance minister said.Sitharaman said that 3 crore marginal farmers have already availed Rs 4 lakh crore of loans on concessional rates in the last few months.The Finance Minister on Thursday announced the second tranche of the Rs 20 lakh crore economic stimulus package focussing on migrants, street vendors, traders, self-employed people and small farmers.

14-05-2020||India||Covid-19 to have significant deflationary impact due to demand evaporation: CEA||Ruling out any impact of stimulus on the price situation, Chief Economic Advisor K V Subramanian on Thursday said the COVID-19 pandemic has severely dented the demand for non-essential or discretionary goods, creating deflationary conditions. He also said that a good part of the Rs 20 lakh crore stimulus package is designed in a manner that the fiscal deficit remains under control. “COVID has a significant deflationary impact because demand especially for non-essential or discretionary goods and services will go down significantly. Therefore, it is unlikely that there would be too much inflationary impact through fiscal deficit or stimulus package,” Subramanian told PTI in an interview. The proposed stimulus package will generate demand by infusing liquidity into the system and thus perk up the economy, the CEA said. “A good part of stimulus is utilising leverage to deliver...while at the same time ensuring that the fiscs remain actually under control,” he said. Last week, the government raised its market borrowing programme by a whopping 54 per cent of the Budget estimate to Rs 12 lakh crore for the current fiscal to fund a comprehensive stimulus package of Rs 20 lakh crore to fight the COVID-19 crisis. According to some estimates, Rs 4.2 lakh crore additional borrowing by the government will push the fiscal deficit to 5.8 per cent of the GDP in FY21 as against the budget target of 3.5 per cent. With regards to proposed structural reforms, Subramanian said Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his recent address touched some important aspects like land, labour, laws and liquidity. “Land and labour are really factor market reforms because these are factor inputs that really affect the cost of doing business and you have seen a lot of changes on these recently at state level,” he said. Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat have announced fundamental labour reforms and other states are also in line to follow up, he said, adding, Karnataka had just gone ahead and changed the regulation on acquisition of land for business. Land can now be directly bought from farmers in the state and other states will also imbibe the model, he said. “Land and labour are state-level subjects. What the PM has outlined is what states are implementing. I think from the perspective of the cost of doing business, these are very important,” he said. On growth he said, India will witness a V shape rebound rather than U shape post COVID-crisis. “It is possible that there may be a lot of pessimistic assessments, I would rather be aware of that bias while making judgement. When you look at researches around Spanish Flu of (1918), it was far more devastating. even then it was V shaped recovery,” he said. That is the best estimate that one can make at this point of time, he said. Pointing out that the Spanish Flu was far more devastating than the current COVID crisis, he said, that flu had affected one-third of the global population in contrast to one per cent now by coronavirus and despite all that it was a V shaped recovery then.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-to-have-significant-deflationary-impact-due-to-demand-evaporation-cea/story-u7uz9SHZMDj3qjYWH2dTWM.html

I still feel the dread how we spent the initial few days after the lockdown restrictions were announced,” said Negi before boarding a state-government bus that would take to his native place in Rudraprayag district from the railway station premises.Similarly Pankaj Singh from Kumaon, who worked in a Pune-based hotel said that he ran out of money after his company said that they couldn’t pay him his salary because of the losses incurred due to the lockdown restrictions.The returnees praised the state government’s initiative to bring them back home, as they had given up hope that train services would resume before another month.Jhabreda legislator Desh Raj Karnwal, who welcomed passengers from Pune, said it was a joyous occasion as the migrants have returned home despite facing hardships due to lockdown restrictions.Chief medical officer, Haridwar, Dr. Saroj Naithani, urged the returnees to adhere to the health department’s guidelines.“All 13 district authorities have been urged to keep a close tab on the migrants who have returned home,” she said. Many of the returnees are planning to stay on in the hill state, and don’t want to go back.“We were neglected by our employers when we needed their support the most. The state government must give us jobs to ensure that we stay back in our home state,” said Narendra Negi, from Pauri Garhwal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lockdown-taught-us-harsh-lessons-of-life-say-migrants-arriving-in-haridwar/story-HqOGgeNxIt63FG5StUxbhP.html
14-05-2020||India||Doubling time of Covid-19 cases slows down to 13.9 days in last 3 days: Harsh Vardhan||The doubling time of coronavirus infection cases has slowed down to 13.9 days in the last three days, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said on Thursday, as the COVID-19 death toll rose to 2,549 and the number of cases to 78,003.The minister, who visited the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) here and dedicated the COBAS 6800 testing machine to the nation, said 14 states and Union Territories have not reported any case of COVID-19 in last 24 hours.These states and UTs are Gujarat, Telangana, Jharkhand, Chandigarh, Chhattisgarh, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Arunachal Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Goa, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram and Puducherry.Also, Daman and Diu, Sikkim, Nagaland and Lakshadweep have not reported any case so far.“It is heartening that the last three days’ (COVID-19) doubling time has slowed down to 13.9 days, while the doubling time in the past 14 days was 11.1,” Vardhan was quoted as saying in a health ministry statement.About ramping up testing capability, the minister said, “We have now developed a capacity to conduct 1,00,000 tests per day. Today marks an important milestone as we have carried out nearly 20 lakh COVID-19 tests at more than 500 laboratories -- 359 government and 145 private -- in the country.” The COBAS 6800, he said, is the first fully automated, high-end machine for real-time COVID-19 PCR testing procured by the government, and is installed at the NCDC.“The COBAS 6800 will provide quality, high-volume testing with a high throughput of test around 1200 samples in 24 hours. It will largely increase the testing capacity with reduction in pendency,” Vardhan said.Highlighting its other features, the Union Health Minister said COBAS 6800 is robotics-enabled minimising the chance of contamination as well as the risk of infection among healthcare workers since it can be operated remotely with limited human intervention. As the machine requires a minimum BSL2+ containment level for testing, it cannot be placed at just any facility. COBAS 6800 can also detect other pathogens such as viral Hepatitis B and C and HIV, according to an official statement.Vardhan also visited the control room and testing laboratories, and reviewed the current status of COVID-19 testing with NCDC Director Dr S K Sing and other senior officials, it said.“I salute the pathologists, lab technicians, scientists and other staff who are our ‘Corona Warriors’ and working under tremendous risky conditions day and night to save their fellow countrymen,” he said and stressed the people need to shun stigmatising frontline healthcare providers and applaud their contribution.Vardhan also emphasised on the quality and sturdiness of community surveillance and contact tracing in fighting the coronavirus outbreak. “It is the need of the hour that all people who are either at home or facility quarantine, need to maintain a strict vigil, and practise the protocols of social distancing, and personal hygiene. Special care needs to be taken of the elderly, pregnant women and children,” he said.As many as 134 COVID-19 deaths and 3,722 fresh instances the respiratory infection were reported in 24 hours till Thursday 8 am, according to the Union Health Ministry.With 26,235 people having cured of the disease so far, Vardhan said the recovery rate has further improved to 33.6 per cent from 32.83% on Wednesday on while the fatality rate was 3.2 per cent.

Hence, we are pushed to the wall and there is no other way out except going for agitation,” BMS general secretary Vrijesh Upadhyay said.In a statement issued here, BMS said it learnt that many other states are readying to follow the trend. “...This is unheard [of] in history and is rare even in most undemocratic countries. BMS state units have written to state chief ministers but only CM of MP has shown the courtesy to meet BMS delegation,” it said.During a meeting of its national office bearers on Wednesday, BMS functionaries discussed the package announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, but flagged concerns over unpaid salaries.“In many states, contractors or employers or agencies didn’t pay salary or wages for April. In addition, crores of workers have lost their jobs. We have decided to send letters to district authorities to highlight problems faced by stranded migrant labourers and to oppose increasing the working hours,” Upadhyay said.As state governments defended their offer of labour law holidays as a move to woo investors and, in turn, increase employment opportunities, BMS said amending and scrapping labour laws during the Coronavirus pandemic will make workers more vulnerable to job losses and exploitation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bharatiya-mazdoor-sangh-calls-for-nationwide-protest-against-labour-laws-on-may-20/story-J1Z3prs7TIdMvy68Sir1bK.html

She decided on reverse migration to her native place in Madhya Pradesh’s Satna district over a week ago after running out of food and money since the nationwide lockdown restrictions were enforced on March 25 to contain the viral outbreak.She was unfazed by the mounting challenge of carrying her physically challenged son on a makeshift stretcher and another two sons in tow, and much of the 1,000 plus kilometres between Surat and Satna to be covered by foot while braving the scorching summer heat and pangs of hunger.On Tuesday, Panna district officials accosted her after she had alighted from a bus near the town’s bypass and was walking towards Satna, carrying her physically challenged son, who from a distance appeared like a corpse in a shroud, raising locals’ suspicions.“Some people in Panna town saw a woman carrying a corpse in a shroud, as the physically challenged son wasn’t visible from a distance. They found out about her deplorable plight only after speaking to her,” said Deepa Chaturvedi, tehsildar, Panna.Rajkumari embarked on her reverse migration journey to her native Majhgawan in MP’s Satna over a week ago.“We’ve been living in Surat for the past three years. I used to work at construction sites and also as a domestic help to make both ends meet. However, I was rendered jobless since the lockdown restrictions were enforced. Soon, I ran out of money and food. I was left with no option, but to go back to my native village while carrying my physically challenged son and two other offsprings,” she recounted to local media persons.“We walked for the better part of our return journey home. At times we managed to hitchhike because of some kind drivers that we met on the way. We also boarded a bus as well, but a man extorted Rs 200 from me. On Tuesday, a bus dropped us on the Panna bypass road from where we’re planning to find our way to the native village,” she added.Tehsildar Chaturvedi said the woman and her children have safely reached their native place under the watch of the Panna district administration authorities. “We took her and the children to a quarantine centre, where they underwent medical tests. They were sent to Satna by an ambulance. We also arranged food grains and some cash for the distressed woman and her children,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-woman-carries-physically-challenged-son-from-surat-to-mp-on-makeshift-stretcher/story-pNljn8SGwrM3iu15PfCrsL.html

14-05-2020||India||BJP says Congress trying its best to save Nirav Modi; Congress rubbishes claims||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Thursday said the deposition by former high court judge Abhay Thipsay in Nirav Modi’s extradition trial in the UK is an example of the Congress sparing no efforts to shield the diamond merchant.On Wednesday, Thipsay made a statement on legal nuances under Indian law centred round the inadmissibility of some police statements in the case against Nirav Modi, and the definition of deception under Indian law.Reacting to Thipsay’s comments, law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said his statement is legally untenable.“A retired judge is giving a judicial certificate, his opinion is legally unsound. This is an attempt to give a misleading defence of a questionable legal variety and we are confident that the legal process will not be affected,” he told journalists during a web conference.Prasad alleged the former judge is a member of the Congress, and it was during the tenure of the Congress-led UPA governments that loans were sanctioned to the firms of Nirav Modi and his uncle Mehul Choksi.“Who is this judge Abhay Thipsay? He’s a retired judge from Mumbai high court. Ten months prior to his retirement, he was transferred by the Supreme Court collegium on administrative grounds to Allahabad high court,” he said.“After retirement, he joined the Congress party in the presence of Rahul Gandhi, Ashok Gehlot and Ashok Chauhan,” he added. Prasad further said the Congress didn’t deny that its former president Rahul Gandhi was present at an event along with Nirav Modi. The event was held in September 2013.“His uncle’s (Choksi’s) company [Gitanjali] was given benefit when [P] Chidambaram was the finance minister. Gitanjali’s exports benefited after the results of the 2014 general election were announced, a caretaker government took a decision that was questionable,” Prasad said.The Indian government, he said, is making all efforts to ensure that Nirav Modi is extradited from the UK.“When the country is trying to bring him back, and the process is underway, a Congress judge is taking a legally unsustainable stand. The BJP condemns this sinister attempt of the Congress to bail out this criminal,” he said. The Congress rubbished the allegations, saying advocates have right to appear for their clients. “Hope #Lawminister has intentionally or unintentionally not reopened can of worms re senior distinguished #BJP lawyers, now departed souls (#RIP), whose children held briefs & retainers 4high profile accused in #UK! Such reasoning denies legal rep 2accused b4 conviction and after!” party spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi tweeted. “#lawministers know right of advocates 2appear 4clients which cnot b trifled with. #Thipsay gave evidence in UK court which he has right 2do wo dictation by BJP. 1 of 3accused in Indira assassination was acquitted cos lawyers like #jethamalani were nt browbeaten into nt appearing!” he said in another tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-says-congress-trying-its-best-to-save-nirav-modi-congress-rubbishes-claims/story-JXaNkZyuAZteDEweiaytVO.html

In the melee one of the youth from Malappuram had collapsed and had to be given first aid. The young man who had come from Chennai tested positive two days ago.Congress MPs Remya Haridas, T N Prathapan and V K Sreekandan and legislators Anil Akkara and Shafi Parambhil had visited the check post to distribute food and other essentials to the stranded people. The MPs dubbed the quarantine order as politically-motivated but said they will go by the directive of the district administration. Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala also criticised the order.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage.“As public servants it is our duty to go by the directive. But we suspect some foul play in this. We went there in the afternoon after TV channels reported that the youth collapsed in the morning. He was tested positive on May 11. We feel it is a move to embarrass us,” said Palakkad MP V K Sreekandan.He also said that the CPI (M) district committee had raised a demand to send him and others into quarantine two days ago.“MPs said they were not there when the incident took place. It is sad, even in trying times the ruling CPI (M) is playing politics,” said Chennithala.The district administration has refuted allegations of politics and said more than 100 people including 50 journalists, 60 police officers, two-dozen medical and revenue officials were asked to proceed on quarantine.

It crashes injuring 15||At least 15 migrant workers injured, four of them critically, as the minibus they were travelling in, crashed into a tree in Angul district late Wednesday night.Police officials in Angul said a group of 15 migrants were walking towards Purinakote area of Keonjhar district from Palasa in Andhra Pradesh, amid the Covid-19 lockdown.On Wednesday, they were stopped at the Boudh district by officials who arranged a minibus for them to help them reach Keonjhar. However, at Thakurgarh area of Angul district last night, the minibus veered off the main road and crashed into a tree.After the accident, the injured were rescued. While 11 were discharged after minor treatment, four are still in Angul district headquarters hospital as they suffered major injuries.This is the fourth such incident involving migrant workers from Odisha getting injured and killed in road accidents since the Centre allowed them to go back to their home State.Early this month, two migrant workers coming back from Surat to their homes in Ganjam district were killed and a few injured when the bus carrying them swerved off the same Kalinga Ghati road in Kandhamal district and dashed against a roadside wall. The two deceased were thrown off the vehicle. A day later, another bus carrying 50 migrant workers from Surat to Ganjam hit a roadside kerb at Kalinga Ghati hilly road leaving 3 injured.In another accident, 5 passengers, including two minors, from Odisha were injured when the bus carrying them from Surat fell on the roadside ditch on Nagpur-Amravati National Highway in Maharashtra.After the accidents, the Odisha government had stopped inter-state transportation of the migrant workers by buses as Shramik Special trains from different States to Odisha became operational. However, movement of buses carrying migrant workers between districts still continues. With 90,000 migrants arriving in Odisha over the last 2 weeks, the number of Covid-19 positive cases have also gone up sharply as most of the positive cases were reported from among the migrant workers travelling from Covid hotspots like Surat, Bengal, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu.Odisha has so far reported 611 positive cases with 73 new cases reported on Thursday. Ganjam district that accounts for a huge population of migrant workers has so far reported 252 cases, the highest in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/migrant-workers-walking-home-put-in-a-minibus-it-crashes-injuring-15/story-8QTKlSZMKahuFTWe0l6ZXI.html

His sample was sent for test to the Rajendra Memorial Research Institute of Medical Sciences (RMRIMS) in Patna on May 11.Bihar’s principal secretary, health, Sanjay Kumar, confirmed that the officer has tested positive.The young IAS officer does not have any travel history in the past 14 days, and is believed to have contracted the infection from local contacts. The health department had so far collected samples of 46 people who are believed to have come in contact with the officer.As per government records, the officer has been put under isolation at the local Ajanta Hotel, which the government had taken over and converted into an institutional isolation centre for asymptomatic Covid-19 patients or those showing mild symptoms of the virus, said health officials.The IAS officer hails from an ordinary background. His father was a clerk at the UP government secretariat in Lucknow and mother a primary school teacher when he cracked the civil services examination in 2017.Efforts to reach Nalanda district magistrate Yogendra Singh proved futile as he did not respond to phone calls or text message.This is the first case of an IAS officer testing positive in Bihar.Earlier, a young Indian Police Service (IPS) officer from Jharkhand cadre, posted as Superintendent of Police in Ranchi, had been quarantined at the Patna Medical College Hospital after the officer and his wife returned from their honeymoon in Italy. The IPS officer and his wife had left Indian shores for Italy and Switzerland on March 8 and returned on March 13.Around 30 policemen, including 21 from the Bihar Military Police (BMP) alone, have tested positive for the virus so far in the state. The BMP-14 headquarters and barrack is at Khajpura, which is a designated red zone.An auxiliary nursing midwife (ANM) from Parwalpur had also tested positive for the virus on May 12. The government had extensively used ANMs and anganwadi workers (AWW) for its house-to-house survey across the state to screen people for Covid-19.Nalanda, with 63 cases, is among Bihar’s top five districts, contributing to 953 Covid-19 cases in the state. As on Thursday noon, Bihar has 546 active cases after seven deaths and 400 patients having been cured and discharged from government facilities so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/27-year-old-sdm-down-with-covid-19-first-ias-officer-to-test-positive-in-bihar/story-vS4LvCu1xprNemoaTcOwrK.html
14-05-2020||India||Delhi’s 42 Covid-19 hotspots offer hope, not red zone ground rules||Nearly half of Delhi’s 80-odd containment zones stand a good chance of coming out of the hard lockdown over the next few days but the city will mostly remain a red zone with limited relaxations beyond 18 May if the Centre does not tweak its policy of listing districts and not specific localities as red zones, a senior Delhi government official told Hindustan Times.“It is going to be a huge setback if the health ministry does not revisit the concept, practice and impact of notifying districts as red zones,” the official said.At internal meetings, Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal and Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal have articulated their reservations about the health ministry’s one-size-fits-all approach that applies the same formula to a district in a metro such as Delhi as a rural district in Odisha or Chhattisgarh.“We have conveyed the point to the Prime Minister and Home Minister and are hopeful of a change,” the official said.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here At Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s marathon video conference with chief ministers on Monday, many states had made the point that the lockdown should continue only in the containment zones and people living outside this hotspot should be encouraged to get on with their lives and resume economic activity.PM Modi did not get into the details but signalled that states would have a greater say in determining the extent of restrictions and relaxations in lockdown 4.0 within a broad national framework.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage An official said some leeway to determine the containment zone also would help. For example, he said they have placed 2,600 people under a hard lockdown in Pratap Khand, Shiva Khand and Govind Khand of Jhilmil colony though cases had been reported from only Pratap Khand part of this locality.Containment ZonesAs of 13 May, a senior government official said, of the 80 containment zones in the national capital, Covid-19 cases were being reported from only 39. The remaining 41 containment zones have not reported a single case over the last fortnight and would be taken out of the containment zone policy if this trend continues.But under the existing red, orange and green classification of districts, this would not help.Because the remaining 39 containment zones are spread across 10 of 11 districts of Delhi.“If the Centre does not change its policy, 10 districts of Delhi would still come under the red zone classification,” he said.Containment Zones that stand a chance of being de-containedAF BLOCK SHALIMAR BAGHGali no 3 shalimar villageIsrael Camp,Rangpuri PahariH.No-62 B Block Gali No-4 Shastri ParkT-606, Gali No-18 GautampuriBlock No. X H.

And the text time Rashtrapati Bhavan hosts a state banquet, the usually lavish spread will pruned to avoid any semblance of opulence.Flower decorations on the sprawling campus of Rashtrapati Bhavan, too, would be limited. No new construction work will be sanctioned in the world’s second-largest presidential estate in the next one year.These are some of the measures being adopted to save funds as much as possible by the republic’s highest office at a time when millions of Indians-- especially migrant workers, poor households and daily wagers—are striving to make ends meet amid the lockdown imposed for the coronavirus pandemic.A brand-new limousine was to be procured this year for use by the president, who has been using an earlier version of the Mercedes-Benz S Class (S600) Pullman Guard. The new set of wheels—with state-of-the-art security features -- was scheduled to come before the next Republic Day. The plan has now been shelved.Rashtrapati Bhavan plans to pare the opulence of state banquets “Menu and guest list will be trimmed for all future banquets. We will ensure full honour for the state guest but we will also be careful not to show off. There will be no opulence.” To be sure, there’s no immediate state visit to India in the works as nations around the world battle the Covid pandemic. The aim, added another official, is to reduce costs by 20% so that the money can be spent for the poor.The President’s Estate will also stop all new construction work, but the limited ongoing work will continue.“Money will be utilised for poor people. But stop in work doesn’t mean cut in money for contract workers. Idea is to reduce consumption by those who are better off in the Rashtrapati Bhavan,” said the second official.So far, President Ram Nath Kovind has given Rs 5 lakh from his salary to the PM Cares Fund. Officials in Rashtrapati Bhavan have contributed another Rs 18 lakh to the fund.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/president-s-virus-led-austerity-drive-no-new-limousine-no-lavish-spread-limited-flower-decorations/story-DqXmGUgGycTYu3nUvqihJM.html

Both are located in Siliguri, north Bengal’s biggest trade hub and gateway to the North-East.Club Montana Vista, which is famous for its restaurant and the Sunday brunch, has tied up with Swiggy for the home delivery. Hirak Jyoti Maitra, deputy general manager (sales), said, “Our management decided to activate some revenue model. The food is being delivered by Swiggy. We will soon finalise a tie-up with Zomato.”Located inside the Uttorayon township, Club Montana Vista earlier used to deliver food to customers inside the township only and the job was handled by its employees. “Now we can reach any address in any part of Siliguri,” said Maitra.Courtyard, on the other hand, has tied up with Zomato to deliver food within a radius of eight kilometres.Samrat Sanyal, general secretary, Himalayan Hospitality and Tourism Development Network, said, “Many hotels are trying to innovate to bring home at least some revenue during this crisis.”Requesting anonymity, a senior employee of a popular hotel said, “This is an opportunity to reach out to new customers by delivering food at their doorstep. We need additional operations to sustain. Though the response so far has not been overwhelming because of the fear among people, we hope to do better.”Considered a landmark, Mayfair Resort in Darjeeling has not started home delivery yet but is planning to stay connected with customers by accepting orders. “The customers have to pick up the food,” said Sabyasachi Mohanty, the manager.“Our main objective is to stay in touch with patrons who have enjoyed our food items for years,” said Mohanty.Some of the famous hotels in picturesque Darjeeling are, however, willing to wait for the business to revive after the lockdown.Elgin Hotel, the oldest heritage star-category hotel in Darjeeling, was set up in 1887. It has 35 rooms and employs 45 people. Diamond Oberoi, its managing director, said, “Though we are struggling, I hope so see some positive developments after October.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-lockdown-with-tourism-hit-hotels-in-darjeeling-region-start-delivering-food-at-home/story-pdDJlOl4oEeuCBMDjjy4cI.html

It had one of highest death rates in the country--5.90%-- as of Monday, according to a government bulletin. The national death rate is 3.24%. Notably, 25% of the deaths have been reported from rural areas.The analysis of the state health department found that 47 of the 161 patients, who died of Covid-19, were in the 51-60 age group. As many as 46 were in the 61-70 and 33 in the 41-50 age group. Thus, 126 patients out of 161, or 78.26%, were aged between 41 and 70.The report said 68.69% of the patients died within three days of their admissions to hospitals. Of them, 30.77% of the deaths were reported on the first day of the hospitalisation.The report said the time between the beginning of Covid-19 symptoms and admissions to hospitals is decreasing. “At the beginning of the outbreak, it was high (12 days) and in the last two weeks, it is around 3-4 days. This indicates that now people are recognising symptoms and reaching on time to hospitals.”The report has suggested a death audit and a comprehensive strategy in tackling the disease like early recognition of high risk and critically ill patients, early intervention guided by experts. It has called for special care of aged people with comorbidities as well as treatment, management and strengthening of health institutions. The report has underlined the need for rational allocation and proper management of human resources and the participation of private doctors and hospitals.Indore’s chief medical and health officer, Dr Pravin Jadia, called late arrival of patients a major issue. “While the administration has launched a massive campaign for screening all the people, we are repeatedly making an appeal to people to immediately consult the health department on the numbers publicised in case they have any [Covid-19] symptoms...”Public health expert Amulya Nidhi said a majority of Covid patients deaths have been associated with comorbidities globally whereas a large number of people with no diseases other than Covid-19 were dying in Madhya Pradesh. He called it a matter of serious concern. “...a large number of deaths on the very day or within a few days of their hospitalisations corroborate our stand that the government has been slow in its approach in screening, identifying and treating Covid-19 patients.”He said there should be a death audit in Madhya Pradesh and the government must have a comprehensive regional and zonal plan to fight the disease. “Otherwise, it will be very difficult for the government to control the situation.”Principal secretary (health department) Faiz Ahmad Kidwai said certain deaths occurred due to late arrival of patients to hospitals and added the government is making all-out efforts to screen and identify Covid-19 patients while making repeated appeals to people to come forward and not associate any stigma with the disease if they are having any problem. “People must understand that it is a viral disease and if diagnosed and treated timely, it curable. More than 1,900 people have been cured and discharged from hospitals across the state.”Madhya Pradesh was among the states, where the Centre last month deputed interministerial central teams to probe perceived lapses in efforts to control Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mp-over-41-of-161-covid-19-deaths-not-associated-with-comorbidities/story-zk0kWYRgqk0DXtOUb2RDCO.html

14-05-2020||India||Trials for 4 AYUSH formulations against Covid-19 to start within a week, says minister||The AYUSH Ministry and the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) are working together on validating four Ayush formulations against Covid-19 , Union minister Shripad Y Naik said on Twitter on Thursday. He also said that trials will start within one week.“The @moayush & the @CSIR_IND are working together on validating four Ayush formulations against #COVID19Pandemic and the trials will start within one week. These formulations will be tried as an add-on therapy and standard care for COVID-19 patients. I am sure and quite hopeful that, our traditional medicinal system will show the way to overcome this pandemic,” Naik said on Twitter. I am sure and quite hopefull that, our traditional medicinal system will show the way to overcome this Pandemics.CSIR Director-General Shekhar Mande and Ayurveda and AYUSH secretary Vaidya Rajesh Kotecha had said on Wednesday that the result will come within three months.“Last week, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan announced that CSIR and AYUSH will work together on four different formulations,” Mande said.Kotecha said that AYUSH and CSIR collaboration has a larger perspective. “This is once in a lifetime opportunity. This type of study never happened in our country. These four candidates are - Ashwagandha, Yashtimadhu (Mulethi), Guduchi + Pippali (Giloy) and AYUSH-64, which was invented for the treatment of malaria and its repurposing is going on,” he said.“So, we are doing two types of stimulus studies as profile access on the high-risk population for Ashwagandha. We have also planned a competitive study between Hydroxychloroquine and Ashwagandha,” he added.The AYUSH secretary said these four formulations will be tried as an add-on therapy and standard care for Covid-19 patients.“It is a clinical study multi-centric on different parts of the country and variable design. For example, this clinical study is for the protocol. We have formed the taskforce and have prepared guideline for the clinical trial. Some of the best scientists of the country from the medical field, from CSIR and others, also reviewed this,” Kotecha said.“We have taken advice from the ICMR so that it becomes so robust that it should be publishable into very high impact journal,” he added.Mande said that Ayurveda is based on thousands of years of clinical practices that have been followed.“So, we trust Ayurveda. We are not able to show the mechanism of action like modern medicine does. Ayurvedic practices have existed much before modern medicine practices come. Therefore, it is important that we validate some of the Ayurvedic principles. So, the time is absolutely right that in the fight against coronavirus. We try some of the Ayurvedic formulations against coronavirus,” he said.He had earlier cited the example of China. “The Chinese have done very well in traditional Chinese medicine practices. They have been able to show why some of their medicines are effective,” Mande had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trials-for-4-ayush-formulations-against-covid-19-to-start-within-a-week-says-minister/story-XU9RsNDC3vLrFukt3gOApK.html

Rajsamand has the second highest number of cases (25), followed by Ajmer with 19, Sirohi with 14, Jalore with 12, Churu with 11 and Dungarpur with 10 cases.The already stretched local administrations are struggling to cope with the influx of migrants and to contain spread of the virus to rural areas where most of them are headed. To deal with the rush of migrants, the state government has sealed the state’s borders to regulate entry and made 14-day quarantine mandatory.Around 19 lakh migrants have registered with the government, of which around 13 lakh have registered to return to Rajasthan.Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot has acknowledged that preventing the spread of the virus in rural areas as migrants return will be the next big challenge for the government.State health minister Raghu Sharma sounded a note of caution on Wednesday saying that the return of the migrants presents a challenge and the government’s priority is quarantine.“The total focus of the health department is now on strengthening quarantine facilities. The migrants are welcome but they have to undergo the 14-day quarantine period compulsorily so that people in the state who have been in lockdown since 50 days and kept themselves safe, do not get infected,” he said.Sharma urged the local representatives to ensure that adequate quarantine facilities are developed in their respective areas. He said that migrants can opt for quarantine in a government facility or at their homes.The local administrations are deploying additional police and healthcare teams to ensure that screening is done and samples are taken and migrants stay in quarantine for the 14-day period.Fresh Covid-19 cases have been reported from districts that were either free of the virus or were on way to recovery.Sirohi and Jalore districts, which were free from the disease till the beginning of May, have been hit by a slew of cases as migrants return to villages.Churu district, which had no Covid-19 positive for 25 days, reported two new cases on May 8. Both were migrants who returned from Surat in Gujarat. Since then, the numbers have grown.Similarly, Jhunjhunu which had not reported any Covid-19 case in the last 16 days, has reported new cases of migrants who travelled from Surat and Delhi.Dungarpur, which was on the verge of becoming free from Covid-19, has also seen a rise in numbers of infected. The district had only one active case till May 5.In Jaisalmer too, there was a ray of hope that the district will be free of Covid-19 after 34 of 35 positive cases recovered. But it has now reported new cases.Health authorities have so far managed, with great effort, to keep the rise in the number of Covid-19 cases under control by enforcing the lockdown, curfews in hotspots and social distancing.But with thousands of migrants returning home, screening, sampling and enforcing quarantine is proving to be a challenge for the administration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/migrant-influx-pushes-up-covid-19-cases-in-rajasthan-govt-fears-spread-in-rural-areas/story-13XTvmJn33GI5tj6CGMsDN.html

14-05-2020||India||Secondary temperature check, same pilot and crew: All you need to know about new rules for flying||The government is preparing guidelines for air passenger service, which is set to resume in the country soon. The service has been suspended since March 25 because of the Covid-19 lockdown.Among the proposals being considered by the government are barring the cabine luggage and passengers above 80 years not to be allowed.Here is all you need to know about the news guidelines being formed by the government before it resumes flight services.• The draft standard operating procedures (SOPs) proposed by the civil aviation ministry have done away with the rule of keeping the middle seats vacant in compliance with social distancing norms.• Passenger ID checks will also not be required so as to minimise the crowds at terminal gates.• The rules make it compulsory for all passengers to arrive at the airport only after completing their web check-in at home. The reporting time for travellers at the airport is proposed to be increased by two hours.• Only passengers whose flights are scheduled to depart in the next six hours will be allowed inside the airports.• Cabin luggage will be disallowed, and only one piece of check-in baggage weighing less than 20kg will be allowed per passenger in the first phase of resumed airline operations.• Those above the age of 80 will not be allowed on flights. According to the draft SOPs, passengers stopped from boarding a flight because of age or if they are found to be running a high temperature will be permitted to change their travel date without any penalty.• Downloading the Aarogya Setu app will be mandatory for all the passengers. Only those with a “green status” will be allowed to enter the airport.• Airlines have been asked to open check-in counters three hours prior to departure time and close them 60 to 75 minutes prior to departure. Boarding will commence an hour prior to departure time and the gates will close 20 minutes before.• Frisking of passengers has been asked to be minimised and to be carried out only if the door frame metal detector beeps.

What is your reaction.Manish Tewari: It is a clear case of skewed priorities of the government. Today, India faces the single biggest humanitarian crisis after the Partition in 1947 and the displacement of people from East Pakistan. There are millions of migrant labourers left without jobs and shelter above their heads. But, for the government, it seems they don’t exist.Q: But this is just the first part of a series of announcements.Manish Tewari: Yes. And we would be closely watching the future announcements too. But the MSME package doesn’t overshadow the fact that the government’s top priority should have been those millions of workers. Why is the government silent on millions of poor, hungry and devastated migrant workers? The second priority of the government should have been to pump up the MGNREGS to provide work to these jobless workers.Q: But the government’s first package had announcements for the farmers and rural India. The Centre has already released Rs 33,300 crore under MGNREGS for this year.Manish Tewari: Do you know the problems farmers are facing today? Yes, the government has given Rs 2,000 under PM Kisan to farmers but many of them are not getting the MSP for their produce. They are offered lower prices on grounds like colour variation, high moisture, etc. This is not the time to do such things. Farmers need to be paid their dues but it is not happening.Q: Do you think that this package will provide a fresh lease of life to Indian MSME sector?Manish Tewari: We welcome the subordinate debt scheme of Rs 20,000 crore and equity corpus fund of Rs 10,000 crore. But if you see the MSME package, it is in favour of the large MSME enterprises, and not the smaller ones. Where is the fiscal stimulus? This is just a liquidity plus package.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/where-is-fiscal-stimulus-manish-tewari-questions-govt-s-covid-19-relief-package/story-l3V6KvqS6lybjmZjzaHzSO.html
14-05-2020||India||Opposition parties hit out at Centre on Covid-19 package||The opposition parties expressed disappointment with the special Covid-19 stimulus package announced by the Centre on Wednesday with the Congress claiming that it has nothing for the migrant workers walking back to their home states.The Congress fielded former finance minister, P Chidambaram, to counter the government’s announcements.“There is nothing in what the finance minister said for the lakhs of poor, hungry and devastated migrant workers who have walked — and many thousands are still walking — back to their home states. This is a cruel blow dealt to those who toil every day,” he said, addressing a news conference through video. “There is also nothing by way of cash transfer to the bottom half of the population (13 crore families) who have been pushed into destitution. Only yesterday, Prof Thomas Pikketty [the French economist] pleaded for cash transfers to the poor,” added Chidambaram.“Except for the modest MSME package, we are disappointed with today’s announcements,” he said. West Bengal chief minister and TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee said, “The special economic package announced by the union government is nothing but a big zero. It is eyewash to fool the people. There is nothing for the unorganised sector, public spending and employment generation,” she told reporters.“Yesterday, when the Prime Minister announced Rs 20 lakh crore package, we were hopeful that the interest of the states will be looked into. But today, after the union finance minister made the announcements, it was found that everything that was said was a bluff,” she said.Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav called the package mere rhetoric. “First it was the false promise of Rs 15 lakh, and now it is the claim of Rs 20 lakh crore...Now, the 133 crore people will be hit by a 133-time bigger ‘jumla’ (rhetoric)...How can anyone believe this...,” he tweeted in Hindi.Congress leader Manish Tewari also criticised the government’s move. “ It is a clear case of skewed priorities of the government. Today, India faces the single biggest humanitarian crisis after the Partition in 1947 and the displacement of people from East Pakistan. There are millions of migrant labourers left without jobs and shelter above their heads. But for the government it seems they don’t exist,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/opposition-parties-hit-out-at-centre-on-covid-19-package/story-cgtZ2OoqF4e7G8rc70Mk2J.html

These labourers are covering hundreds of kilometres travelling or walking through the state up to the UP border.

The project is worth Rs 60 lakh, said Ghildiyal.“We decided to build an oxygen plant here in the district as with increasing migrants returning to the district, we wanted to boost our infrastructure to be able to deal with any extreme situation if cases arise. This will also help the numerous pilgrims that come to Kedarnath shrine and face problems due to lack of oxygen at that height,” said Ghildiyal.In the past decade, over 250 people have died on their way to Kedarnath shrine due to problems related to lack of oxygen.“We usually keep 30 oxygen cylinders on the way to the shrine starting from Gaurikund apart from small oxygen cylinders that can be carried in hand. When pilgrims need to use oxygen from these cylinders, it becomes difficult for us to refill them as we had to transport them to Rishikesh for filling. Now with the new plant, we will be able to save time and money on refilling these cylinders,” added the district magistrate.He further said that nearby districts like Chamoli will also be able to take benefit of this plant in emergency situations, as it would be easier to transport oxygen cylinders from one district to another instead of travelling to plains in Rishikesh.The district administration is also looking at options to connect the plant to other hospitals in the district or make arrangements for fast transportation of oxygen cylinders to remote areas during emergencies.Located at a height of nearly 3,500 metres above sea level, the Kedarnath temple remains covered in snow for most part of the year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kedarnath-area-to-get-oxygen-plant-will-help-pilgrims-visiting-the-shrine/story-ZzeGGP42f88nLZ333IkY5K.html

That art of living is very important as it is not a natural virus. It is an artificial virus and many countries across the world are researching for a vaccine,” Gadkari said in an interview to NDTV.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here This is the first time that the Indian government has made a comment on the origin of the deadly contagion. This admission by a senior cabinet minister is significant as most countries have blamed a lab in Wuhan for the creation of the virus.“The second thing is detection methodology. We need some good methodology. Immediately, we can identify (the virus). This is unexpected because this a virus from laboratory, this is not a natural virus,” the union minister added.Gadkari’s statement comes at a time when countries across the world, including the US, have raised suspicions that the virus which has brought the world to a grinding halt, was created in labs in Wuhan, the capital of central China’s Hubei province.Also read| Covid-19: What you need to know todayUS President Donald Trump, on multiple occasions, has blamed China for allowing the virus to spread around the world.

14-05-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced the first part of the economic package India has been waiting for since late March, when a lockdown was enforced to combat the rapid spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. While some economic activity has resumed in the country, especially since May 3, the toll on the economy is high — securities firm Nomura expects that the Indian economy will shrink by 5.2% in the year to March 31, 2021 — necessitating a stimulus package. The Prime Minister announced a ~20 lakh-crore one on Tuesday, and a day later, the finance minister spelt out the fine print of some of the measures.More will follow. Some experts have pointed out that the package includes monetary measures which can’t really be called a stimulus, and that a credit guarantee doesn’t mean the outgo of the entire amount guaranteed but entails only the risk of a possible outgo of the portion guaranteed. Still, India does finally have a stimulus plan; in terms of magnitude, it compares favourably with what many of the G20 nations have announced (except Japan, which has announced a package amounting to almost a fifth of its economy); and directionally, this is one more step in India’s return to some sort of normal.And that — the return to normal, not the package — is the focus of this column.Since March 25, India has been locked down. Some areas were locked down harder than others but, at least till May 3, there was a lockdown across the country. All establishments and offices, except those related to important departments of the government or providing essential services, were closed. People worked from home (or pretended to). Markets remained closed, except for stores selling essential products. Many states instituted curfews; and most people stayed indoors.Since May 3, some offices in some states (and some parts of some states) have started functioning. Stores selling non-essential products have been allowed to open in some states. As have private offices (although they have been told they can operate with at most a third of their workforce).It is now becoming clear that starting May 17, the lockdown could be eased even further. Over the past week, the refrain in government circles has changed from “flattening the curve” to “learning to live with the virus”. This is understandable. It is important that India opens up — but safely. State governments are currently figuring out what the best way to open up would be. Many are said to be considering travel between districts, may be even across their borders, even as they plan to sharply define containment zones where infections are still raging, and continue to lock them down. This is a pragmatic approach — but it poses significant challenges.In the absence of a cure or a vaccine for the coronavirus disease, wearing masks, social distancing, regular hand washing, and avoiding social and religious gatherings is the surest way to stay safe. Yet, even the partial removal of lockdown restrictions has resulted in chaotic scenes in many parts of the country. Some states are already talking about tourism. Others are talking about religious gatherings and events.Scientists around the world agree that the removal of a lockdown will always mean a rise in the number of infections; administrators know this too, but believe that they can manage if the increase remains below a certain threshold.That’s where people come in.As states exit the lockdown, it will be difficult for their police departments to enforce basic health and distancing protocols. This has to be done voluntarily by people. If they do not wear masks (or wear them improperly), and if they do not follow social distancing norms, it could mean a return of a wave of infections. That is the risk India faces.And it is a problem that has only one solution — a responsible citizenry that recognises what is at stake.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-90e1QsApjRfQ61IyYzqdeL.html
14-05-2020||India||With no regular patients in Bengal’s hospitals, piles of medicines likely to expire in June||Several medicines and drugs that were purchased and stored in state-run hospitals and rural health centres to treat regular patients are now lying unutilized and are nearing their expiry dates. The reason being because of the lockdown hardly any patients are turning up for treatment in hospitals.District hospitals have alerted the state health department that unless these drugs are utilized they could expire and this would lead to loss of government property.“Due to the lockdown for prevention of Covid-19 cases, general patient flow of different disciplines decreased remarkably. For this reason the outflow of the following medicines has decreased. At present the following medicines are lying in the store as slow moving items which may not be consumed within their potency period,” said a letter sent by the Asansol district hospital in West Burdwan.The list includes ampules, vials, tablets and tubes of various kinds of injections, drops and lotions needed to treat patients suffering from cardiac arrest, malaria, labour pain and peptic ulcers. There are also antibiotics, anesthesia and eye-drops. The stock of some drugs like dobutamine and dobramycin are supposed to expire in June 2020. In another letter, accessed by HT, the superintendent of the state-run Gangarampur subvisional hospital in South Dinajpur district has alerted this could lead to loss of government property.“Will be highly obliged if you take necessary action so that the medicines can be utilized to avoid loss of government property,” the letter sent on April 27 stated.Similarly, several medicines at the Habra state general hospital in North 24 Parganas are also nearing their expiry dates, a letter accessed by HT said. Chandrima Bhattacharya, minister of state for health in West Bengal, said: “I am not aware. Please contact the health department.” Senior officials of the department, however, remained tightlipped and said only the minister can comment.Meanwhile, with allegations surfacing that there is a shortage of PPE kits, masks and gloves as a result of which several doctors and other frontline medical staff have been infected with the virus, the state government has started procuring such items from the small and medium scale industries. A committee has also been formed to speed up the procurement.The state has ordered around 16.5 lakh PPEs out of which till May 12 it has received 7.4 lakh. Another 9 lakh is pending. Around 32.5 lakh masks (N95 and FFP2) have been ordered out of which only around 3.6 lakh have been received till date.“Usually it is the West Bengal Medical Services Corporation Limited which goes for bulk purchases of medicines and medical equipment. But because of the crisis a special committee has been formed to speed up the procurement process. A helpline has also been launched where frontline medical staff can place their demands,” said a senior official of the state health department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-no-regular-patients-in-bengal-s-hospitals-piles-of-medicines-likely-to-expire-in-june/story-3lCU12slTfB6La4H7rQGDM.html
14-05-2020||India||Bihar reports 7th Covid-19 death; 2 nurses among 4 who test positive in Patna||Bihar on Wednesday reported its seventh death of a coronavirus patient, as migrant workers contributed to more than one-third of the total cases, with the virus spreading to cover the entire state late on Tuesday.Fifty-three people, including two nurses — one from the Nalanda Medical College Hospital (NMCH), a dedicated Covid-19 hospital, and another from the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS), both in Patna — also tested positive, while a 56-year-old woman, suffering from cancer of gallbladder and infected by the virus, died at the NMCH on Wednesday. This was Bihar’s first female fatality to the Sars-CoV-2 virus, with co-morbid conditions, as the total number of cases swelled to 932.A resident of Ashiana-Digha More, the NMCH nurse had come in contact with two Covid-19 patients during the course of their treatment at the hospital, said NMCH medical nodal officer, Dr Ajay Kumar Sinha.Five health personnel at the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS) in Patna have already tested positive for the virus so far, the latest being a nurse on Wednesday. The nurse who stays on the hospital campus, used to reside with another nurse who had previously tested positive and had to terminate her pregnancy due to some gynaecological complications.The two nurses were among the four people to have tested positive in Patna. Nine other cases were reported from Nawada, seven from Bhojpur, six from Bhagalpur, four each from Siwan and Banka, three each from Begusarai, Rohtas, Khagaria and Muzaffarpur, two from Gopalganj and one each from Madhubani and Kaimur.Around 130 people reported positive on Tuesday in what was the biggest single-day spike in Covid-19 cases since March 22, when Bihar reported the first three cases of the fast spreading contagion.As of Tuesday, 343 Covid-19 cases were reported last week, according to government data shared through a tweet by its principal secretary, health, Sanjay Kumar.MIGRANTS LEAD SPIKE IN CASESThe government attributed the sharp increase in the number of cases to the return of migrants from other states.“Of the total Covid-19 cases, 332 are those who came to the state from within India during the lockdown period. Of them, 277 people came after May 3 (lockdown 3.0),” said Bihar’s health secretary Lokesh Kumar Singh.Singh said of the 277, most had come from Delhi (78), followed by Gujarat (71), Maharashtra (57), and West Bengal (20) and Haryana (13). He also said the percentage of cases testing positive as against the samples tested, had gone up of late.“As of now, 2.32% of the total samples tested (39,149) have turned positive. This figure used hover between 1.7%-1.8% until recently, but has shown an increase since the migrant workers have begun returning home in an organised and structured manner. The increase in number of cases is the outcome of the random tests we have been conducting on them,” added Singh.Bihar’s concern may be far from over as over 4.27 lakh migrants are still expected to come by 267 additional Shramik Express trains.“Till May 11, we had received 1,37,401 migrant workers by 115 special trains for them. We are now planning to run 267 more trains, which are expected to ferry an additional 4,27,200 passengers. Together, we will receive 5,64,600 migrant workers. This is not the final figure on migrant workers expected to reach Bihar from outside the state,” said Anupam Kumar, secretary information and public relations department (IPRD).Over 85,500 migrants are expected to return to Bihar between Wednesday and Thursday.“We transported 34,629 passengers by 25 trains today and expect another 50,910 passengers by 34 trains tomorrow,” said Kumar.He also clarified that the increase in the number of Covid-19 cases in the state was not due to increased testing of samples, but because of the home-coming of migrant workers.QUARANTINE PARAMETERSAround 1.89 lakh people, mostly migrants, were staying for 21 days in 4,163 block quarantine centres, set up to curb the large-scale spread of the virus if they were to directly return to their respective villages.Spelling out the different parameters set by the government for quarantining people coming from outside the state, he said students coming from outside the state, including Kota, had been allowed home quarantine, as many of them were minors and girls.“Those returning from abroad will have to stay at institutional quarantine centres on payment basis. The government has already identified hotels in Gaya and Bodh Gaya, where international passengers coming to the state will be quarantined,” added Kumar.Normal train passengers would not be quarantined as they were coming under relaxation measures after proper screening at the station of origin, he added. The government re-started limited train operations from Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-reports-7th-covid-19-death-2-nurses-among-4-who-test-positive-in-patna/story-pes9NryPXigVL5TeT1CoeI.html
14-05-2020||India||Faulty Chinese kits part of ICMR list, may be removed||Rapid testing kits by two Chinese companies that were found faulty last month were included in a revised list of kits approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on Wednesday but the apex research body said it was looking at dropping the two firms.The Covid-19 IgM/IgG antibody rapid test kit from Zhuhai Livzon Diagnostics (CEIVD) and SARS-CoV-2 antibody test (Lateral flow method) from Guangzhou Wondfo Biotech were found to be showing unusually high variations in their results in various states. The apex research body had prohibited their use.The ICMR said all 15 kits validated by the National Institute of Virology in Pune were included.“We are looking at getting the names of the two companies dropped from the list to avoid any confusion. However, the sensitivity and specificity of a test kit varies from batch to batch which is why lot testing is done for quality assurance. As we have said these kits are not meant for diagnostic purposes and can show variation in the field settings,” said Dr Rajnikant Srivastava, spokesperson, ICMR. The body also put a disclaimer in the document, saying “These rapid antibody test kits have been validated in the laboratory. However, the performance of the kits may be subject to variation under field conditions. Above listed kits are validated with the mentioned batch number only. Responsibility for batch to batch consistency lies with the manufacturer.”Four days after procuring and distributing kits from these two companies to states on April 21, ICMR had asked states to not use them after unusually high variations (between 6 and 71%) were seen in field settings. After a week-long investigation, on April 27, ICMR had prohibited their use. The import license of these two companies was also cancelled by the Central Drugs Standards Control Organisation soon after.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/faulty-chinese-kits-part-of-icmr-list-may-be-removed/story-pobkoQQCzqxMAzB3YbRrFM.html
14-05-2020||India||Four-fold rise in daily coronavirus cases across India||The number of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases reported in a day has seen a nearly four-fold rise over the past one month, with 990 cases reporting positive on April 15 as opposed to 3,525 cases reported on May 13, according to data collated by the Association of Healthcare Providers of India (AHPI), and released on Wednesday. Hindustan Times’s own dashboard, showed 12,330 new cases on April 15 and 78,015 on May 13.However, the case positivity rate has been hovering between 3-4%, with upper limit so far being 6.21%, and the case recovery rate has also seen a steady rise in India and currently stands at 32.8%, the body said. Union health minister Harsh Vardhan said while reviewing one of the states for Covid preparedness on Wednesday that while the doubling time for the number if infections reduced to 11 days over the past two weeks, it has improved to 12.6 days over the past three days, an indication that the spread may be slowing. As on Tuesday, there are 2.75% active Covid-19 patients in intensive care units (ICUs), 0.37% on ventilators, and 1.89% on oxygen support, according to the Union health ministry data. There are nine States and union territories that have not reported any cases of Covid-19 in last 24 hrs: Andaman Islands, Arunachal Pradesh, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Goa, Chhattisgarh, Ladakh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram. Daman and Diu, Sikkim, Nagaland and Lakshadweep have not reported any case to date.The sample testing capacity has also been strengthened, and on Tuesday India tested 94708 samples for Covid-19 in a single day in 352 of its government laboratories and 140 approved private laboratories, according to health ministry.Currently, India can test one lakh samples a day, and a total of 18,56,477 tests have been done so far since the country first started testing samples for Covid-19 on January 24 in the Indian Council of Medical Research’s apex virology laboratory in National Institute of Virology in Pune. That translates into around 1430 tests per million of population. “India has done well in managing the disease so far, and in future also if required we have requisite infrastructure in place to deal with the rush of patients,” said Harsh Vardhan.As on Wednesday, India has about 900 dedicated Covid hospital operational with 1,79,882 beds (Isolation beds- 1,60,610 and ICU beds- 19,272), and 2,040 dedicated Covid health centres with 1,29,689 beds (Isolation beds- 1,19,340 and ICU beds- 10,349), along with 8,708 quarantine centres, and 5,577 Covid care centres with 4,93,101 beds, according to the health ministry data. The Centre has also provided 7.8 million N95 masks and 4.2 million personal protective equipment (PPE) kits to the States and union territories, and central government hospitals.“From only importing PPE kits to manufacturing close to 3 lakh PPE kits domestically in a day, India has come a long way in just a little over a month. We are prepared in every which way,” Harsh Vardhan added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fourfold-rise-in-daily-cases-across-country/story-6yBVjvMvt8kNEmDioOblhP.html
14-05-2020||India||Web courses on India’s traditions in the works||New Delhi: The Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR) plans to launch an online platform for short but specialised courses on traditional Indian knowledge as people are confined to their homes because of the Covid-19 pandemic globally. The external cultural relations wing hopes the Universalisation of Traditional Indian Knowledge Systems (UTIKS) Platform will serve as a bridge between Indian culture and the global population.The courses will include subjects like Ramayana and Mahabharata epics, traditional Indian dances, Panchtantra tales, arts like making sky lanterns, freedom struggle, Indian wildlife, temple architecture, folk arts, yoga.“Through the UTIKS Platform, for the first time, a structured attempt is being made to generate academic interest in various nuances of Indian culture and later an opportunity to enhance its understanding is being offered. India’s soft power is all about creating a sound understanding about our culture and this new initiative would go a long way in achieving this,” ICCR chairperson Vinay Sahasrabuddhe said.Sahasrabuddhe, a Bharatiya Janata Party member of Rajya Sabha, said not just foreigners but even those in India, who are ignorant about culture and diverse manifestations of the country’s unity, will be helped in enhancing their understanding.An ICCR official said many were taking up short-duration courses offered by platforms like Coursera and edX especially with normal lives have been disrupted because of the pandemic. It was felt that student-friendly courses related to traditional Indian knowledge system can serve as a strong bridge between India and those who want to study its culture, the official added. The official said the UTIKS platform will evoke greater curiosity in the minds of those, who know precious little about the Indian culture. It will also be for those introduced to the culture who want to know more. “It would help India as an easy to understand civilisation and culture, doing away with the enigma that surrounds the idea of India in a more learner-friendly manner,” said the official.The ICCR has some content for the courses. It also plans to tie up with specialised bodies like the National Gallery of Modern Art and the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts to create high-quality courses.A list of proposed courses, accessed by HT, ranges from those on Indian traditional celebration practices like rangoli, mehndi, sky lanterns, cookery, tea and coffee varieties, kahwa, masala tea, pickles, snacks, deserts, traditional games, Indian epics, dances, constitution, social justice traditions, gender, sustainability philosophy, rural governance, temple architecture and traditional embroideries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/web-course-on-india-s-traditions-in-the-works/story-nJMyPsH7QjDJAnxfmHIZ6H.html
14-05-2020||India||Why Maharashtra was not able to check rapid Covid-19 spread||On April 7, exactly four weeks after the first Covid-19 case was detected in Maharashtra on March 9, the count crossed 1000 to 1018. That day, the death toll in the state was 64 (India’s overall toll was 160 that day), and the mortality rate stood at 6.29% (more than double of India’s mortality rate of 3.02 on the same day).Thirty days later – on May 7 – the state had 17,974 cases and 694 deaths. In the next six days, India’s worst-affected state added nearly 8,000 cases to take the total to 25,922 and 975 deaths on Wednesday. Simultaneously, Maharashtra has recorded 5,547 recoveries. The states with the next highest number of cases and deaths are Tamil Nadu (9227 cases, 64 deaths) and Gujarat (8904 cases, 537 deaths). Delhi is fourth with 7998 cases and 106 deaths.As of Wednesday, May 13, Maharashtra’s mortality rate stood at 3.76%, a significant improvement from the first few days of April, but still above the national average of 3.23%. If Maharashtra is excluded from the national data, India would have 49,912 cases and 1477 deaths on May 13, bringing the mortality rate further down to 2.96%. The global mortality rate, according to data on worldometers.info, is 6.72% (6 pm, May 13). On Wednesday, Mumbai’s numbers stood at 15,747 cases and 596 deaths, giving a mortality rate of 3.78%.Also Watch | Covid spurt in Mumbai: Official admits ‘some evidence’ of community spread What exactly went wrong in Maharashtra’s case? Why does one of India’s most industrialised and prosperous states have both the most number of Covid-19 cases as well as deaths? The answer perhaps lies in what the state did not do in January and February right up to March 9, when the first two Covid-19 cases were detected in Maharashtra. In an interview with HT on April 8, Dr Avinash Bhondwe, president of Indian Medical Association, Maharashtra, laid the blame on travellers returning from the United Arab Emirates for the initial spurt in cases. “In Maharashtra, more than 40% of the infections were owing to travellers who returned from the UAE,” he said. “Even though Maharashtra’s first case was of a Dubai returnee, the state government waited for 10 days to start screening travellers from the UAE. This was a major loophole in the screening process.”Indian airports began universal screening only in the third week of March. By then, on average, 42,000 international travellers landed in Mumbai every day. On March 22, India banned all domestic and international passenger flights to and from Indian airports. “By then, it was too late,” said a Maharashtra state health department official, who wished to remain anonymous. “We had thousands of fliers coming into Mumbai every single day and only a handful of them were screened for symptoms. What we cannot know for certain is the number of asymptomatic patients from the United States, the United Kingdom, Singapore and other south-east Asian countries that may have passed through Mumbai international airport between February and March 22.”Dr Bharat Purandare, infectious diseases expert, Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital, Pune, said in an earlier interview to HT, “In retrospect, we can say that the government should have made universal screening of all passengers mandatory much earlier. Also, we should have stopped international flights in the first week of March.”A month after the first case was detected, Maharashtra was testing at 290 per million population. Since then, the state has improved its testing rate on May 13 to 1892 per million population. Gujarat tests at 1760 per million and Tamil Nadu is at 3523 per million (all data according to respective state health departments). The trouble with Mumbai, which now accounts for a fifth of all cases in the country, though, is that its detection rate over the last few days has risen to 33%. Which means that, for every 100 persons tested, 33 are detected with Covid-19.Civic officials said that this was due to the change in testing protocol targeted at containment zones. Additional municipal commissioner, Suresh Kakani, told HT on May 12, “Detection rate is increasing because of the increased number of testing samples per day. Often, pending test results were added to a particular day’s count. Hence it did not give us clarity. If we calculated the detection rate against 124,000 samples tested with 14,521 positive cases, then the detection rate remains 11.71%. This figure is higher than the state and national average because of targeted testing conducted by BMC in containment zones.” The national average is 4.3% and Maharashtra’s average is 7%.Civic officials said Mumbai’s high number is primarily because of aggressive testing of high-risk contacts. Moreover, state and BMC health officials blamed the lack of physical distancing in Mumbai’s most densely populated areas for the cluster spread. “Eight out of Mumbai’s 24 wards account for more than 50% of the city’s cases,” a senior civic official told HT on Wednesday. “These are among the most densely populated areas. Worli Koliwada, Dharavi, Kurla, Byculla, Saki Naka, and Andheri (West) are areas where the population density is anywhere between twice to 10 times that of Mumbai’s average.” According to United Nations population data for July 2019, Mumbai’s population density is 32,303 per square km. Dharavi, India’s largest slum, has nearly 1000 cases. Its population density is 354,166 people per square km, according to BMC population data.(With inputs from Kushel Madhusoodanan, Rupsa Chakraborty and Eeshanpriya M S)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-the-state-was-not-able-to-check-rapid-covid-spread/story-RakrhoQUlNLLg1pc2jMe1N.html
14-05-2020||India||State seeks central force deployment||Mumbai: Maharashtra on Wednesday requested the Centre to deploy 2,000 central police personnel in the state to ease the pressure on the state police as it deals with the Covid-19 pandemic. The request came two days after chief minister Uddhav Thackeray sought additional central forces during a video conference with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Officials said the state, which is the worst-hit by the pandemic in the country, needs additional forces to ease the stress on the state police and for additional deployment for the Muslim festival of Eid, which is expected to be celebrated subject to the moon sighting on May 25. Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh on Wednesday said state police personnel were falling sick due to the burden of long working hours amid the Covid-19 lockdown. He added a rising number of personnel (84 police officers and 709 constables) have tested positive for Covid-19. Deshmukh said the deployment of the central forces will allow the government to give some rest to the state police personnel. “The police force has been fighting against the coronavirus day and night and by putting in additional duty hours. Many of them have tested positive for the virus. The demand raised for the additional force is also keeping in mind the ensuing festival...on May 25,” he said.The state government has deployed 32 companies of the State Reserve Police Force in districts with higher Covid-19 cases.

The state also recorded its highest number of deaths in a 24-hour period with 54 fatalities that took the toll to 975.Mumbai also breached the 15,000 Covid-19 case mark with 800 new patients that pushed the city’s tally to 15,747. The state now has 25,922 cases, making it the state worst hit by the disease in the country.Of the deaths recorded on Wednesday, 40 were in Mumbai, six in Pune, two each in Jalgaon, Solapur and Aurangabad, and one each Vasai-Virar and Ratnagiri. The health department added that it has not added Mumbai’s 220 patients from May 7 in the total tally earlier, due to the absence of reconciliation on the portal of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).Out of the total Covid-19 cases in the state, over 50% of the cases were reported in this month alone. Since May 1, Maharashtra has clocked 13,820 Covid-19 cases, which accounts for 53.31% of the total cases.Maharashtra’s mortality rate stood at 3.76%, but still above the national average of 3.23%.With the numbers soaring in Aurangabad city, state health minister Rajesh Tope and district’s guardian minister Subhash Desai took stock of city’s preparedness on Wednesday. The city has 586 cases and 18 deaths. Malegaon, in Nashik district, is another hotspot in the state where cases have seen a surge. Tope visited Malegaon on Wednesday to take stock of the situation.The current doubling rate -- the number of days in which positive cases double – in Maharashtra is 11.1days while that for India is 12.5 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maha-tally-25k-mumbai-at-15k/story-XD94ya32ZBdUHGf07tkdtM.html
14-05-2020||India||CAPF canteens to go ‘Indian’ from June||New Delhi Canteens of the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF) will sell only indigenous products beginning June 1, Union home minister Amit Shah announced on Wednesday, a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi called for popularising local commodities (be vocal about local, he exhorted) in order to make India a self-reliant country in the face of the challenges posed by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).CAPF comprises seven central paramilitary forces, namely the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), Border Security Force (BSF), Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB), National Security Guards (NSG) and the Assam Rifles.Shah appealed to people to make the maximum use of “swadeshi (locally made)” products and encourage others to do the same. “Moving in this direction, the home ministry has decided that all canteens of the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF) will sell only indigenous products from June 1. With this, a million CAPF staffers and five million family members will use local commodities,” he tweeted.In another tweet, Shah underscored that PM Modi’s appeal to make the country self-reliant and use local products will lay the foundation for India becoming a world leader.Shah also said the combined sales of all CAPF canteens is worth ₹2,800 crore annually. There are over 119 CAPF master canteens and 1,625 subsidiary canteens across the country — from border areas to places hit by Maoist violence. “If every Indian pledges to use products made in India, the country can become self-sufficient in five years,” Shah said.CAPF canteens were set up in 2006, after demands by central paramilitary personnel who cited that the army already has such canteens.CAPF canteens are already selling local products to a large extent, following an October 2019 home ministry order that asked them to shun foreign brands and introduce “swadeshi” goods, including food items, accoutrements for combat and regular duty uniform, bed sheets, towels, household goods, clothing and stationery, and other items. A large number of items is procured from Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC).ITBP director general SS Deswal, who is also holding an additional charge as the BSF chief, said: “Most of the items we use in our daily life are made in India and are procured from Indian companies. These include uniforms, food, clothes and even weapons. In fact, during the Covid-19 pandemic, all masks, sanitizer and equipment used for sanitization (by ITBP and BSF) are manufactured by Indian companies. The canteens will be replenished with only local products from June 1.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/capf-canteens-to-go-indian-from-june/story-pQBV2z7zb1efRBdIKznyPJ.html
14-05-2020||India||Govt to begin antibody tests in 21 states to check virus prevalence||new cases rising over the past few weeks, India has scaled up its coronavirus disease (Covid-19) testing capacity to one lakh samples a day, nearly two weeks ahead of the Union health ministry’s initial target of reaching that number towards the end of May.“…the testing capacity has increased in the country and it is 1, 00,000 tests per day with 347 government laboratories and 137 private laboratories. Cumulatively, 17, 62,840 tests have been done so far for Covid-19. Whereas, 86,191 samples were tested yesterday,” said health minister, Harsh Vardhan, in a statement on Tuesday.The cases doubling time in the past 14 days has been 10.9. Over only the past three days, however, this has improved to 12.2 days. Also, the disease fatality rate is 3.2%, and recovery rate stands at 31.74%, which is better than those in many other affected countries. As of Monday, there have been 2.37% active Covid-19 patients undergoing treatment in the intensive care (ICU), 0.41% patients are critical, and on ventilators, and 1.82% are on oxygen support.“In view of the surge of returning migrant labourers, States/UTs need to focus on more effective surveillance, contact tracing, adequate testing and timely treatment of all the returnees. This also includes the ones that shall be returning from abroad,” Harsh Vardhan said.The states have been directed to ramp up the surveillance for Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (SARI) / Influenza Like Illness (ILI) in the affected and non-affected districts, and take the help of government medical colleges if required.“Such measures will help to indicate the presence of any possible hidden infection at an early stage, thus helping in its timely containment,” he said.The ministry, along with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), is also conducting a community based sero-survey to estimate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, infection within the Indian households in 69 districts of 21 states, covering at least 24,000 adults. “The survey is coordinated by ICMR’s National Institute of Epidemiology (NIE) and National Institute of Research in Tuberculosis (NIRT), Chennai. This household level cross-sectional survey will cover 24,000 adults distributed equally across four strata of districts categorized on the basis of reported cases of Covid-19,” said ICMR in a statement.The survey will involve collection of venous blood samples from 400 randomly selected individuals (one per household) from 10 clusters in each district. Samples from each of these individuals will be tested for presence of IgG antibodies using ELISA test developed by ICMR-National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, and is being manufactured by Zydus Cadilla.The results of the survey will provide information about the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection in different parts of the country.Besides this community-based survey, health ministry is also initiating hospital-based surveillance to monitor the trend of infection in all districts.“It is a part of initiating systemic surveillance to know the extent of disease spread, to determine the future course of action in order to curtail the virus spread. This is the most effective way,” said Giridhara R Babu, Professor and Head Lifecourse Epidemiology, Public Health Foundation of India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-to-begin-antibody-tests-in-21-states-to-check-virus-prevalence/story-UjfXd3f5kB09J5vKZ0IKwM.html
14-05-2020||India||India to recruit 1,500 patients for WHO’s solidarity trial||India will be recruiting at least 1500  patients in about 30 hospitals across the country for the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) global solidarity trial for treatment of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), which is coordinating trials on behalf of the country has already begun fast-tracking the process of recruiting patients for the multi-country trial to compare four treatment options to assess their relative effectiveness against Covid-19.The trials include four potential anti-viral drugs, remdesivir, chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir-ritonavir and lopinavir-ritonavir with interferon (β1a). By enrolling patients in multiple countries, the trial aims to rapidly discover whether any of the drugs slow disease progression or improve survival.“Right now, we are really following the numbers, so the trial sites will be in areas from where most cases are being reported. Nine of the sites have already been approved and four more sites are very close to being approved. Though 1500 patient is the initial number, there is no cap and we can always recruit more patients for the trial, if required,” said Dr Sheela Godbole, head, division of epidemiology, ICMR-National AIDS Research Institute (NARI), which is the nodal centre for coordinating the trials in India.“Fast-tracking means trying to add as many sites as possible in a short span of time, and at the same time complying will all the local ethical and other regulations meant for such researches. The ethics committees are minutely looking at each application and approvals are being given after due diligence. Just because we are fast-tracking the process does not mean we will be compromising on quality,” she added.On March 28, ICMR announced that India will be participating in the WHO Solidarity trial, for which over 100 countries have requested participation to find effective therapeutics as soon as possible, via the trial. “The participation of multiple clinical trial units or hospitals in multiple countries will ensure adequate enrolment of participants in the shortest possible time. This will help fast-track identification of correct treatment options for the Covid-19 disease,” said ICMR in a statement. However, patients who give their consent to participate in the trial will not get to choose which arm of the trial they become a part of. It will be a randomized allocation of medicines for patients. All drugs to be tried in the trials, except for remdesivir, have already been in use in India for various other health conditions.“It is meant to see how the medicines behave in early stages of disease and what is the effect as the disease progresses,” said Dr Godlbole.“The results will be based on global enrollment, meaning the data from patients recruited from all countries will be analysed to reach a conclusion. It won’t be based on only what the results were among Indian patients. It will take some time,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-to-recruit-1-500-patients-for-who-s-solidarity-trial/story-vNomMlnezRmmCB86oXR7pI.html
14-05-2020||India||₹3k-crore from PM-Cares fund to be spent on migrants and ventilators||The PM CARES (Prime Minister’s Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations) fund announced its first ever allotment on Wednesday -- Rs 3100 crore to be spent on meeting the demand for ventilators, welfare of migrant workers, and supporting the ambitious programme to develop a vaccine against Covid-19 virus. In a statement, the government said: “Rs.2000 crore will be earmarked for the purchase of ventilators, Rs. 1000 crores will be used for care of migrant labourers and Rs.100 crores will be given to support vaccine development.”The first allotment comes just six weeks after the fund was formed on March 27. The fund, set up as a trust, is headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi . Other ex-officio members of the trust are Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, home Minister Amit Shah and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman.The Prime Minister—Chairperson of the Board of Trustees—shall have the power to nominate three trustees to the Board who are “eminent persons in the field of research, health, science, social work, law, public administration and philanthropy” a government statement released at the time of the fund’s creation said. The first allotment of Rs 3100 crore comes hours after the finance minister announced the details of the first tranche of the Centre’s relief package. With tens and thousands of migrants fleeing back to their states of domicile, Rs 1000 crore will be given to states ; this will be at the disposal of the District Collectors/Municipal Commissioners. They fund will be used to support the states in “providing accommodation facilities, making food arrangements, providing medical treatment and making transportation arrangements of the migrants,” the statement added. The money will be divided between the states on the basis of their population and number of Covid-19 cases. “State/UT-wise funds will be released on the weightage of (a) Population of the State/UT as per 2011 Census – 50%, weightage (b) Number of positive COVID-19 cases as on date – 40% weightage and (c) Equal share (10% weightage) for all states/UTs to ensure basic minimum sum for all states,” the statement said. With India being able to produce sufficient number of PPE (personal protective equipment) kits for frontline healthcare workers, the PM CARES fund has allotted the lion’s share of the first allotment to the other key component—ventilators. The fund will be used to purchase 50,000 ‘Made-in-India’ ventilators to augment the infrastructure for tackling the Covid pandemic. These ventilators will be provided to government-run COVID hospitals in all States/UTs. While a large part of the fund will be used for immediate requirements, the government is also keen on developing an indigenous vaccine. Pointing out that a vaccine against COVID-19 is the “most pressing need” and that Indian academia, start-ups and industry have come together to wok on cutting-edge vaccine design and development, PM CARES fund plans to spend Rs 100 crore ton this initiative. The PM’s Principal Scientific Advisor will supervise the utilization of this fund. The PM Cares fund has attracted contributions from large companies, and also high-profile personalities from all walks of life. The creation of the fund has generated some controversy with several opposition parties wondering about why the PM’s National Relief Fund wasn’t being used for this. Some chief ministers have raised objections about contributions by companies to the PM Cares fund being eligible for spends under Corporate Social Responsibility activities, but those to the chief ministers’ funds not being eligible. The government has said that the fund will be audited by independent auditors, and not the Comptroller and Auditor General of India. The current corpus of the fund isn’t known.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3k-crore-from-pm-cares-fund-to-be-spent-on-migrants-and-ventilators/story-a8Ay5vLm4LZfnleL7cMGHP.html
14-05-2020||India||States tread carefully, likely to redefine zones after May 17||State governments on Wednesday started working on their strategy for the fourth phase of the lockdown, which is expected to largely affect only the containment zones, which range from a building to a locality, and which is also expected to see the resumption of almost all activities, except large social gatherings and the reopening of educational institutions. Officials in several states said guidelines defining containment zones would come by Saturday. They said a district may have red, orange and green areas, unlike the existing definition where an entire district is defined as red, orange or green, depending on number of Covid cases. HT learns that states may be allowed to take a call on this classification ; currently the zoning is done by the union health ministry. The officials, who asked not to be identified said their states would likely allow all industrial activities, offices, and stand-alone stores to function from May 18 onwards. Public transport will also resume, they said. And people will be allowed to travel freely between districts, except in containment zones, and to other states with travel passes. And home delivery of all goods, not just essentials, would be allowed, the officials added. HT spoke to 18 officials across 15 states. All the officials said educational institutions would continue to remain closed. Most schools in the north close around the middle of May in any case; and those in the south that usually reopen in June may take a call on whether or not to do so closer to the end of the month, they added. Religious and political meetings are unlikely to be allowed for some more time. Malls and other public places will also remain out of bounds for people. Marriages and funerals will be allowed with limited attendees, the officials said.Some states may have state specific relaxations. For instance, the Karnataka government wants interstate travel with a 14-day quarantine. The Rajasthan government has allowed inter-district travel and wants interstate travel, as does the Chhattisgarh government. Kerala wants restricted interstate travel . Bihar and Jharkhand are against any interstate movement and have asked the Centre to provide guidance on the issue. Telangana, which has extended the lockdown till May 29, is likely to announce more relaxations in sectors such as information technology and real estate. Kerala wants the resumption of metro services, local trains, domestic flights, restaurants and hotels to revive the tourism sector. Karnataka may open restaurants, hotels, gymnasiums.and golf courses after May 17. Andhra Pradesh has proposed resumption of all activities except in containment areas. Both Himachal and Uttarakhand will allow hotels and resorts to open with limit capacity.In effect, a weekly atlas of what’s open and what’s not, and in which state, may be needed. Gujarat, which has second highest number of Covid-19 cases in the country, wants to resume all economic activity in major urban centres except Ahmedabad, which accounts for 70% of the state’s cases. Rajkot will fully open from Thursday and Surat from Monday, officials said. Similarly, Tamil Nadu, another highly industrialised state and with the third highest number of cases in the country, plans to open all places except containment areas.Maharashtra, which has the maximum number of Covid-19 cases in the country and 1,289 containment areas, has opted for a minimalistic approach.State officials said it does not want metro services to resume, nor will it allow inter-district travel. It will also not allow offices to open fully although more industries will be allowed to function in orange and green zones.In cities such as Mumbai, Pune, Thane and Nashik, all hotspots, the officials said, lockdown 3.0 conditions are likely to continue. “Newer hotspots like Aurangabad and Jalgaon have been added to the list of cities such as Mumbai and Pune. In such a scenario, the lifting of the lockdown for at least two more weeks is not possible,” said a senior government officer.The eastern states of Bihar, Jharkhand and Odisha want to continue with stricter lockdown because they are seeing a rise in cases with the return of migrant workers. “We will have no exemptions in the fourth phase as Covid cases are increase. In fact, we are looking at stricter lockdown,” a Bihar government official said. State governments have formed committee of officials to chalk out specific guidelines for the next phase of the lockdown, which would be much more state specific than all the earlier versions of the lockdown. Andhra Pradesh has formed as many as six committees to work out strategies, said K S Jawahar Reddy, state special chief secretary (medical and health). The Kerala government constituted a task force headed by former chief secretary K M Abraham, which is expected to submit report by Thursday. Rajasthan government’s expert panel on the exit strategy will submit report on Friday. The Gujarat government has formed a committee of medical experts to suggest control spread of Covid once the lockdown measures are relaxed. Several states such as Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Rajasthan have sought people’s suggestions for exiting the lockdown and activities to be allowed after May 18. Maharashtra has sought inputs from district collectors by Thursday. Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar has already held consultation with all legislators on lockdown 4. In Madhya Pradesh, all district collectors and MLAs have been asked to collect the responses and submit them to the state government by Thursday. Officials said most suggestions that have come in so far pertain to the home delivery of ration and money to the poor, opening of all grain markets fully and allowing more work under MGNREGA. MP home and health minister, Narottam Mishra said, “Lockdown restrictions will continue to be implemented strictly and relaxationwill be as per the prime minister Narendra Modi’s direction.”In Uttar Pradesh, a senior government official said, chief minister Yogi Adityanath has sought suggestions on restarting economic activity, measures to attract investment and ensuring jobs to migrant labourers.

14-05-2020||India||Idea of a resilient India is driving the policy package that is being laid out: Jayant Sinha||Former union minister and chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on finance, Jayant Sinha said in an interview that the priority of the Narendra Modi government is to strengthen India and to make it resilient.The economic package announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the measures announced by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman are aimed at making India a competitive nation that will also be an attractive investment destination, he added. Edited excerpts Small enterprises which employ around 110 million people had a long list of demands. With the six measures that have been announced for them today, has the government addressed those concerns?The Prime Minister has been very clear that the idea of a resilient India is driving the policy package that is being laid out . As the finance minister explained carefully today, there already have been several tranches, which have dealt with a number of most urgent issues that had to be addressed. We have provided food, gas cylinders, cash support for the most vulnerable sections of society. Now, what we also had to do is to address the requirements of the MSME sector and many representations were received from MSMEs, laying out all the challenges that they were facing both in terms very low demand for their services and products as well as all of the cash pressures that they are facing right now.What the finance minister has done today has squarely addressed all of the urgent concerns raised by the MSME sector. Will going local be a priority for the government?The priority for the government is to strengthen India and to make it resilient. We want to first make India a very competitive nation so that our local companies, products and services are purchased by the domestic consumers as well as enthusiastically by consumers around the world. One aspect of being resilient is that our local companies are as competitive as possible. The other part of becoming competitive is to be able to attract global companies to invest in India and to build products and services here. So global and local are two sides of the same coin. Our local companies must become stronger and more global and Indian must become more attractive and a better platform for global companies; and doing so is going to make India more resilient and more self reliant.A lot of people equate going local with protectionism, which in turn is limiting. There has also been some criticism of efforts by some states to amend labour laws. The Prime Minister was very clear on Tuesday and said that India must contribute to global growth, provide support and be very much a part of the global supply chains. He was crystal clear in that regard and that is why I said we have to strengthen our local companies and be an attractive investment destination for global companies.To that end there many aspects of production that we have to address; labour being one of them. The Prime Minister also said that we have to address all factors of production, whether it is land, labour, liquidity as well as laws so that we are globally competitive for both local companies as well as global who want to be stay production units in India. The Congress says there is nothing for the poor, hungry, workers walking home? That there are no cash transfers.  We are running many Shramik specials (trains) and many state government have also made arrangements for buses so that people who want to move from the cities back to the rural areas can do so. All provisions are being made for people to travel; and then in the rural areas tremendous amount to support has been provided. About 800 million families have got double the ration, 80 million people have got gas cylinders, we have provided 30 million senior citizens, widows and disabled people with a thousand rupees in their accounts; some 200 million women Jan Dhan account holders have got Rs.500 per month. Then additionally we will support MSMEs, ensure that informal workers in the city are able to continue working and get their salaries. So their need to go back to their homes will be reduced because their employers are going to be supported by the MSME package.There is also a demand that the union government should borrow more and spend more; and allow states to do so too.That is already what we are doing; the government has announced that instead of Rs 7.8 lakh crore borrowing they are going to do Rs 12 lakh crore borrowing. For MSMES we are saying that they will be able to automatically borrow more money that will be hundred percent guaranteed by the government, similarly NBFCs are going to be able to borrow more. The states have got relief through the ways and means account so they can also borrow more. At every step along the way we are providing financial support to every section of society, to all the different governments and many more announcements are to come. Former finance minister P Chidambaram said the PM’s announcement was intended to grab headlines, but that the page is however, blank.The page is being filled out day by day with very substantial details. Today’s announcements will continue and there is a very comprehensive detailed document that is being prepared which will be circulated with all the necessary details about Atmanirbhar Bharat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/idea-of-a-resilient-india-is-driving-the-policy-package-that-is-being-laid-out-jayant-sinha/story-tK5N1cJNGvXxxFxkLmDKHL.html
14-05-2020||India||Covid poses risk to healthy Indian lives: WHO report||Indians lose a decade of healthy life to non-communicable diseases like diabetes, cancers, and heart and lung diseases, and the threat to a healthy life will be compounded by of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, said the World Health Organization (WHO)’s annual report card of the global health status released on Wednesday. The average life expectancy in India is 68.8 years, with women living close to three years longer than men. Life expectancy is 70.3 years for women in India, and 67.4 years for men, said the 2020 World Health Statistics report.The healthy life expectancy in India is 59.3 years, and lags far behind developed nations. It’s similar for women and men, with women living 59.9 years compared to 58.7 years for men. The healthy life expectancy is the highest in Japan, with people living 74.2 years of disease free life. It’s also high in France, Italy, Norway, South Korea and Australia, where people live a healthy between 73 years and 73.5 years.The biggest gains in life expectancy and healthy life expectancy were among low-income countries, where life expectancy rose by 11 years between 2000 and 2016 because of improved access to services to prevent and treat infections such as HIV, malaria and tuberculosis, said the WHO report.The deaths and economic disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic are threatening to derail the health gains and the progress made towards achieving global development goals, the report said.“The good news is that people around the world are living longer and healthier lives. The bad news is the rate of progress is too slow to meet the Sustainable Development Goals and will be further thrown off track by Covid-19,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general, WHO.The adolescent birth rate (births per 1,000 women aged 15-19 years) in India was still high at 10.7, with around 72% women in the reproductive age having access to modern methods of contraception.“It is disappointing to see India among the bottom of all countries in context of healthy life expectancy, which is now primarily driven by non-communciable diseases (NCDs), such as diabetes, cancers, heart and lung disease, and stroke. The Covid-19 pandemic will bring this down further as our recent research shows that poor control of diabetes and its many complications will rise in the future,” said Dr Anoop Mishra, chairman of Fortis Centre for Diabetes, Obesity and Cholesterol, New Delhi.The report said there is an overall shortage of services within and outside the health system to prevent and treat NCDs. In 2016, 70% all deaths worldwide were attributable to NCDs, with 85% of them occurring in low and middle-income countries. Two in three deaths in India are from NCDs.“One of the key lessons from the Covid-19 pandemic is that we must invest in data and health information systems, as part of our overall public health capacity, before a crisis strikes. To emerge from this crisis stronger, we must be able to monitor progress with real-time, reliable and actionable data,” said Dr Ghebreyesus.Strengthening country capacity for data and information requires collaboration across governmental and non-governmental institutions, including ministries of health and finance, national statistics offices, offices of the registrar general, local and regional government, and academia.“We need health systems that have equally good outreach in rural and urban areas, and that’s still work in progress in India. It takes several years for the data to become reliable as there is lacunae in data collection for the first five to seven years before systems become stable enough. Unless data collection is stable, the numbers are not reliable, particularly with emerging infections like Covid-19,” said Dr V Ramana Dhara, professor at Indian Institute of Public Health-Hyderabad.The WHO report said between one-third and half the world’s population was able to obtain essential health services in 2017, with 40% of all countries reporting less than 10 doctors per 10,000 people. Over 55% of countries have fewer than 40 nursing and midwifery personnel per 10,000 people, said the report. According to the health ministry, India has a doctor-population ratio of 1:1,457 and Nurse-population ratio of 1:675.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-poses-risk-to-healthy-indian-lives-who-report/story-DV5xFRaZQRsk7Fwlar8YuL.html
14-05-2020||India||Odisha district turns hot spot with 210 infections in 12 days||On May 2, Odisha’s Ganjam reported its first case of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) with an 18-year-old migrant worker testing positive for the infection. He was part of a 69-member group that came back from Gujarat’s Surat after the resumption of bus services for stranded labourers stuck in different parts of the country due to the lockdown. Six of the teenager’s co-passengers, too caught the infection. Since then, the district has been reporting a steady surge in cases.It now has the most cases (210) among all districts in Odisha, which has a total of 538 cases and three fatalities. On Wednesday, Ganjam recorded 52 cases (all migrant workers), the highest in the coastal state. According to the state health and family welfare department, migrant workers returning from Gujarat and West Bengal accounted for 92 of the 101 new cases in the state. These people were housed in quarantine shelters after their return.“Migrants from Surat, a Covid-19 hot spot, have been the biggest source of the infection in Odisha, followed by migrants from West Bengal...Of the 538 cases total, nearly 300 are Surat returnees, while another 150 are those who returned from Bengal. Till migrant workers started arriving, we had things pretty much under control,” said Bijoy Mohapatra, director of health services, Odisha.Mohapatra’s concerns underscore a potential challenge Odisha and other eastern Indian states, which have a frail health care system, could be facing. Bihar and Jharkhand, too, have seen a steady inflow of migrant workers returning home since the beginning of May as the central government allowed special buses and trains to ferry them to their destinations. Now, both states are reporting a steady rise and spread in fresh infections.It took Odisha 42 days from March 15, when the first case was reported in the state, to record 100 infections. The next 100 cases took 15 days. The tally reached 300 in another week as migrant workers started returning. Then, the cases reached 400 in two just days. On Wednesday, Odisha’s case count crossed 500.According to officials, an estimated 80,000 migrant workers have arrived from various states in buses and trains till Wednesday, and another 450,000 are expected to return in the next 10 days.“Though most of the cases are quarantine centres, there is a danger of local transmission...The more we test, the more positives we will get,” Mohapatra said.Till Wednesday, Odisha tested 72,756 samples. As of Tuesday, Odisha tested 1,621 samples per million, above the national average of 1,370.Ganjam district collector Vijay Amruta Kulange said officials are taking all possible steps to stop the spread of the virus. “All positive cases so far have been from the quarantine centres, which have been declared containment zones. In case a person comes from outside without our notice, the sarpanches have been asked to send them to a mandatory 28-day quarantine,” he said.The fear of infections increasing with the arrival of migrant workers is not restricted to eastern India alone.In Rajasthan, where about 1.3 million of an estimated 1.9 million migrant workers have returned, fresh Covid-19 cases have been reported from areas such as Dungarpur, Jhalawar, Sirohi and Jalore districts, which didn’t have any cases previously. Similarly, Khargone, Morena and Sagar districts in Madhya Pradesh were Covid-19-free till people started returning from Maharashtra and Gujarat.Both Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan have made 14-day quarantine mandatory for all those coming back.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-district-turns-hot-spot-with-210-infections-in-12-days/story-UxUyBOIpkf94H1RWeTEqAN.html
14-05-2020||India||When you love, you don’t give up: Migrant workers refuse to part from their pets||A picture of migrant workers walking on foot on the Mumbai - Nashik Expressway to reach their home town recently went viral. The puppy and the duck that they were carrying with them were their beloved pets. They refused to abandon these animals even in the face of such adversity. Forced to walk for days to reach their home, holding their pets close to them, they were prepared to face whatever may come their way. Rajesh Natraj, a Mumbai-based animal rescuer, who posted about this incident on Facebook says this family turned down the offers of those who wanted to foster the animals. “They would never part from their pets, whatever may come their way. They said they leave their families back home and come here to work, and all they get in return is disrespect. They can’t trust anyone with their pets, they told us, and kept walking,” says Natraj.Natraj says that some migrants were also carrying cats and rabbits. They didn’t let anyone click their pictures. “They thought someone will snatch their pets and end up killing them as there are rumours that animals spread coronavirus,” says Natraj.The activists says that it’s tragic that educated and well-off people have been abandoning their pets after falling for silly rumours. The commitment of these migrants workers towards their pets is inspiring, and we need to learn from them.There has been a steep rise in the number of people who want to give away their pets in the wake of the pandemic. “We hope people learn from these migrants and stop trying to dump their pets. The shelters are already over burdened. The numbers of calls that they are getting daily is scary. This picture should serve as an eye opener. The migrant workers are better informed than so many of us,” he says.This image will always be a poignant reminder of how the ones we failed set a rare example of love and compassion despite all their handicaps. Only those with integrity have the power to acknowledge and honour commitments that are for life. Pets are one such commitment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/when-you-love-you-don-t-give-up-migrant-workers-refuse-to-abandon-their-pets/story-smIC1ggDnu6Fy1OL5jHtuI.html

The death toll from the pandemic in the national capital stands at 106.Of the 20 deaths that were recorded in the daily health bulletin, 15 took place in Dr Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) Hospital, but none of these are from the previous 24 hours. “All the deaths in the health bulletin today are from before 24 hours. No fresh deaths have been recorded from RML today,” said Dr Minakshi Bhardwaj, medical superintendent of RML Hospital.With a total of 41 deaths, according to the Delhi government data, RML accounts for almost half of the 86 deaths that have been reported in the ten designated Covid-19 hospitals so far.Delhi reported 13 Covid-19 deaths on Tuesday. After a discrepancy in the deaths reported in the daily bulletin and those in hospitals were reported in the media, Delhi chief secretary Vijay Dev issued an order on Monday, asking all hospitals to report their deaths in a time-bound manner. This required all hospitals to send in their death reports, or ‘Nil’ (no deaths recorded) reports, by 5pm every day. Following this, a three-member death audit committee set up by the government would meet to review the numbers.“Most of the deaths that have been recorded today and yesterday are from the backlog that hadn’t been cleared. With the new standard operating procedures (SOP) in place, the earlier records of patients who had died have started coming from hospitals. The backlog should be cleared within the week, after which there won’t be such unusual spikes in numbers,” said a senior official from the Delhi government, on condition of anonymity.It is likely that the backlog will continue to be cleared over the next few days. Even with the sudden spike in deaths, Delhi’s mortality rate continues to be a just a little above 1%, against the national average of 3.1%Of the deaths recorded so far, almost 55% people were 60 or older and nearly 87% had comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, heart or kidney disease.On Wednesday, Delhi recorded 359 new cases of Covid-19, taking the city’s tally to just two short of 8,000. At the same time, 346 people across the city recovered from the viral infection, improving the city’s recovery rate.With 2,858 people having recovered from the infection since it was first detected in the city on March 2, the recovery rate of Delhi stands at almost 36%. The national recovery rate currently stands at about 33%.Of the 5,034 active cases in the city, 1,634 are admitted to the Covid-19 hospitals with severe symptoms. Of them, 114 are in the intensive care unit with 14 people on ventilator. Delhi has about 306 ventilators in government hospitals and another 800 in private sector ones.Another 1,055 people with mild to moderate symptoms are admitted to the Covid Care Centres or Covid Health Centres. And, 1,113 Covid-19 positive people who are pre-symptomatic or have mild symptoms have been placed in home isolation across the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/20-more-delhi-logs-highest-single-day-jump-in-fatalities/story-WNXJjOk9eCP9SuhMqlL1wO.html
14-05-2020||India||India’s jute production records loss of Rs 1250 cr; mills may demand relief from Centre||Indian jute manufacturers have said the lockdown has so far resulted in loss of production of I.5 lakh metric tonnes worth Rs 1250 crore and it may appeal to the Centre for a financial package for survival of the industry.“We have watched the announcements made by the Centre. We will see what is announced over the next few days and take a decision on approaching the Centre for a relief package,” Raghavendra Gupta, Chairman, Indian Jute Mills Association (IJMA), told HT after Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced several packages for the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) sector on Wednesday afternoon. Set up in 1884, IJMA is the apex business chamber for India’s jute industry.In West Bengal, which is the highest jute producer in the country, permission has been given by the state government to operate 40 of the 60 mills that sent applications seeking resumption of operation, Gupta said. But the mills are operating with limited manpower owing to social distancing norms. “The nationwide loss stands at Rs 1250 crore,” Gupta said.“The jute industry is grappling for survival after being in lockdown for over one and a half months now. Already 1.5 lakh metric tonnes of production of jute goods has been lost estimated to be valued at Rs.1,250 crore. With the cash flow drying up, jute mill companies are finding it extremely difficult to make ends meet,” IJMA said in a statement on Tuesday.Gupta said the future of over three lakh jute mill workers and 40 lakh jute farmers hang in the balance and if the situation persists it may result in permanent sickness and closure of mills.“Jute industry’s loss has been plastic industry’s gain. Continuous dilutions under the provisions of the Jute Packaging Act have taken place over the lockdown period. Already about 3 lakh bales of orders for jute bags have been diverted to PP/ HDPE industry. If the lockdown situation continues any longer, further dilutions cannot be ruled out,” IJMA said.The carryover of raw jute at the end of the jute crop year 2019-20 is now expected to be over 22 lakh bales, IJMA has said. “With reports of normal sowing this year, across all jute growing areas, the prices of jute fibre has fallen below the Minimum Support Price of Rs. 4,225/- per quintal for TDN3 grade,” it said.To ensure safety of workers during production, the IJMA had deployed the global consultancy company Pricewaterhouse Coopers to work out standard operation procedures (SOP) for running jute mills.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-jute-production-records-loss-of-rs-1250-cr-mills-may-demand-relief-from-centre/story-TNXgRwWVRdM43JNyZP0anJ.html

All systems of the metro including the signalling, electrical, rolling stock, tracks etc will have to be tested in detail before services are ultimately started,” said a tweet from DMRC.The total length of metro network in Delhi is close to 400 kilometres and it caters to several lakh commuters daily.The DMRC had implemented social distancing measures at its network stations before it finally suspended its services and undertaken sanitization exercises to disinfect its premises including trains. The measures are likely to continue even after services resume. “DMRC is working out a detailed cleaning & maintenance procedure in view of the pandemic. The exercise will be extremely exhaustive as it involves 264 stations over 2200 coaches and over 1100 escalators and 1000 lifts. Protocol for social distancing etc. are also being worked on,” another tweet by DMRC said.India is going to enter the fourth phase of lockdown after May 17 and several states are pitching for the resumption of at least interstate public transport. However, the Delhi government has not made it clear how soon the metro services will resume in the national capital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lockdown-4-0-delhi-metro-starts-maintenance-work-for-resumption-of-services/story-kwt9XqKmAaLjEJDxKY9v4K.html
14-05-2020||India||Gujarat sets up panel to study reasons for high mortality rate||With Gujarat reporting the second-highest Covid-19 related deaths in the country after Maharashtra, the state government on Tuesday constituted a committee of medical experts to study the reasons for the high mortality rate, especially in Ahmedabad.Maharashtra has reported 23,401 cases and 868 deaths while Gujarat 8,904 cases and 537 deaths.A doctor, who is a member of the high power committee constituted by the deputy chief minister and health minister, Nitin Patel, said the decision for setting up the panel was taken at a meeting to prepare protocols for proper research on the reason for the high death rate.“The doctors and other experts who are part of the committee have been asked to prepare the protocols, standard operating procedures and resources required for the research,” the doctor said on condition of anonymity.He said so far no such study has been done by any state. “Not only experts from other states but guidance would be also taken from the Indian Council of Medical Research and doctors and pathologists from abroad too. This study is necessary to understand the progression of the disease,” the doctor said.Dr Parthiv Mehta, senior pulmonologist–intensivist, said the study will help to understand the pattern and reasons for the deaths. “Extensive autopsies will guide the medical experts to understand how the virus is affecting the human beings and what is leading to the mortality,” Mehta said.Jayanti Ravi, principal secretary (health), on Tuesday said 362 cases have been reported in the state since Monday taking the tally to 8,904. “... 267 cases were reported from Ahmedabad, 30 from Surat, 27 from Vadodra, and rest from other districts. ... 24 deaths were also reported in the last 24 hours,” she said.The state government has decided to open factories and industries in the non-containment zones after no cases were reported from Rajkot over the last. Ashwani Kumar, the secretary to chief minister Vijay Rupani, said all businesses will be allowed to resume in Rajkot from May 14 provided they do not fall in the containment zones.“The approvals for the same will be provided by the district collector. Rajkot falls under the Orange Zone. Despite that, the state government did not allow shops and businesses to restart...”Kumar said of the 542 special trains for the stranded people till Monday, Gujarat operated the maximum--233-- in the country to ensure the safe return of over 2.80 lakh migrant workers to their homes.Gujarat police chief Shivanand Jha said only those with confirmed e-tickets will be allowed at railway stations as no tickets are available at the ticket counters. “It is mandatory to wear masks and maintain social distancing.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gujarat-sets-up-panel-to-study-reasons-for-high-mortality-rate/story-uRJgxoj2eignc1jjmmv6NJ.html
14-05-2020||India||Train services resume today after nearly two months; 54,000 bookings done, says Railways Ministry||The Indian Railways is resuming passenger train operations from Tuesday, nearly two months after services were stopped due to the nationwide lockdown imposed as a precautionary measure to contain the spread of Covid-19.The railways opened bookings for passenger services on Monday with 15 trains a day connecting Delhi to Mumbai, Chennai, Bengaluru, Kolkata and other big cities.“Thereafter, Indian Railways shall start more special services on new routes,” the government said in a statement. The rail network, among the world’s largest, carries over 20 million people each day and is the lifeline for people living in far flung corners of the country.The Railways Ministry said that reservations were issued to more than 54,000 passengers, according to news agency ANI. Bookings for 15 passenger trains started from 6 pm on Monday, two hours behind the scheduled opening time.The Railways has made Aarogya Setu mobile application, which helps in tracking the spread of the virus, mandatory for passengers who want to board the trains.All first AC three-tier AC tickets for the Howrah-New Delhi train were sold within the first 10 minutes and all seats were reserved in 20 minutes, news agency PTI quoted IRCTC as saying. The Howrah-New Delhi train is scheduled to begin its journey from Howrah at 5:05 pm on Tuesday.All AC-1 and AC-3 tickets for the Bhubaneswar-New Delhi special trains were also sold by 6.30 pm.The restart of some train services was announced late on Sunday, when India’s coronavirus infections jumped by 4,214 - the highest ever - to 67,152. India’s rail, road and air services were suspended in March to stop Covid-19 infection to spread into the country’s interior, but the case numbers have risen daily. But officials say the spread of the disease was largely contained due to the stringent restrictions.Deaths from Covid-19, the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus, has reached 2,206, the ministry of health said on Monday. A fifth of India’s cases come from the densely populated cities of Mumbai, Delhi, Ahmedabad and Pune, which are also major centres of economic activity.At a meeting with the chief ministers on Monday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that resumption of train services is needed to rev up the economic activity, but said that all the routes will not be resumed and only a limited number of trains would ply, according to ANI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/train-services-resume-today-after-nearly-two-months-54-000-bookings-done-says-railways-ministry/story-urUHbvdHhSLtWgXEIMLq9K.html
14-05-2020||Editorials||Reform, but with a green focus||On May 12, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a ₹20 lakh crore economic package to overcome the current distress and the devastating impact of the lockdown on individuals and businesses, encourage domestic industry, attract investments, and create what he called a “self-reliant India”. The PM also indicated that the government will undertake deeper structural reforms, across land, labour, and laws. To use this moment to reset Indian institutions and economy to ensure both prosperity and equity is, in principle, a laudable goal.While undertaking the reform process, however, India’s fragile environment must not become a casualty. India’s development path shows that there is a good chance of this happening because successive governments have veered towards the view that stringent environment protection laws hamper economic development. This is a false binary. Speedy clearances of projects without proper regulatory and impact assessment may secure investments from the market and finances from banks in the short-term, but their long-term effects can scar the economy and people. Unfortunately, the ministry of environment, forest and climate change’s new draft Environment Impact Assessment (EIA), released in March, also seems to reflect the development versus environment outlook. The EIA is a process of evaluating the impact of a proposed project or development on ecology and humans. Instead of strengthening the process, the draft EIA, experts believe, is diluting the regulatory process for projects; sets severe limits to the quality of project appraisal; gives exemptions to more sectors from public hearing (where project-affected people can raise their concerns), and allows lenient monitoring and compliance protocols.Undermining the environment will have an adverse effect on the economy, as well as the well-being of the people. This should have been starkly apparent, with the coronavirus pandemic attributed to human interferences such as deforestation, encroachment on animal habitats and biodiversity loss. The climate crisis, too, has led to enormous costs for communities, societies and States. Ultimately, lost ecological infrastructure and decline of natural capital, including human health, cause a decline in inclusive wealth. The impact of this is even more acute for countries such as India where achieving development goals such as reducing poverty and inequality is already a challenge. The Covid-19 crisis is a good opportunity for the Indian government to re-evaluate its priorities and opt for a greener development path. Reform, but respect nature.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/reform-but-with-a-green-focus-ht-editorial/story-Vb7nf0ife5rsKN58OsYBbI.html
14-05-2020||Editorials||The pandemic is taking a toll on mental health | HT Editorial||History has shown the enormous toll that pandemics take on governments, health care systems, economies, organisations and people. But there is also a huge, but often invisible, toll they take on mental health. In the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, citizens in large parts of the world are locked down, their lives have got disrupted, their livelihoods are hurt or even destroyed, and they stare at an uncertain future for themselves and their loved ones. Unsurprisingly, this has caused anxiety, fear, stress and trauma. Recognising this, United Nations secretary general, Antonio Guterres, on Wednesday, spoke of the need for governments to urgently address mental health care needs, and asked them to include mental health as part of their policy response to the pandemic. The immediate challenge for each country, of course, is to flatten the curve of infections, prepare health systems, and revive the economy. But the mental health crisis will stay beyond the pandemic, and people, across classes and communities, will need help. Despite a robust law in place, India ranks poorly in mental health awareness and treatment. Battling social stigma on the one hand, and the lack of professional interventions on the other (India’s psychiatrist to patient ratio is a dismal 1:100,000), it has an uphill battle. The government must formulate an empathetic response to provide help to affected individuals; organisations, communities, and families must come together to offer solidarity and support; and medical professionals must find innovative ways of offering care and therapy at a time of social distancing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-pandemic-is-taking-a-toll-on-mental-health-ht-editorial/story-hruYCFxzGwlk6vJQzKAibJ.html
14-05-2020||Editorials||Quad is becoming a key post-Covid-19 coalition||Quad-core is part of computer vocabulary, but may equally apply to the heart of a post-coronavirus pandemic world order. The United States (US) has been holding high-level conversations with clusters of governments about the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and what comes after. India was party to the most recent one, a foreign minister-level meeting, which also included Japan, Australia, South Korea, Brazil and Israel. A regular weekly meeting is now held at the foreign secretary-level, which replaces the last two (Brazil and Israel) with New Zealand and Vietnam. What is common to both are the four members of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, generally called the Quad. If this pattern continues, it will indicate Washington and the three other members see as a cornerstone of a post-Covid-19 world.The Quad is far from being a group with a coherent purpose. What has happened is that all four governments have come to accept that they are strategically committed to the organisation. India’s concerns that Australia lacked a domestic consensus on the Quad is a case in point. China’s global standing is much reduced by Covid-19, a status aggravated by its bullying tactics, and has left a space for this sort of alignment. Of all the members, New Delhi will be least interested in talk of an alliance. It has arguably the best working relationship with Beijing and alone lacks a formal US military relationship. However, this is a foursome that has begun to evolve rapidly into something larger than the sum of its parts and, rightly, is being kept on the top of the stack of geopolitical options.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/quad-is-becoming-a-key-post-covid-19-coalition/story-2TUKTqgZG8hZtk5hFYV9xJ.html
