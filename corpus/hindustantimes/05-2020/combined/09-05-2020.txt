They were sleeping on the rail tracks after a long journey on foot in a desperate attempt to get back to their home towns hundreds of kilometres away in Madhya Pradesh. While the government has failed to make adequate arrangements for migrant workers, who power our economy, aircraft are being arranged for those coming from abroad. It is not just a matter of emotion that migrants want to get home, though that should be enough. It is not just a matter of their right to move about within their own country, subject to reasonable restrictions designed to ensure public healths. The idea should have been to maximise their mobility while minimising restrictions. It is a matter of their survival. Sadly, the Supreme Court and high courts are silent. They could have asked the central government to operationalise the return of the migrants from their host states to home states on these simple principles. But they have not. The impact is there for all to see. Every day, there are stories of migrant workers and their families, bereft of food and money, making desperate attempts to reach their homes. How many must have gone to an early grave not because of Covid-19 but because of callousness and disorganisation of the State? People act on common sense. The migrants in Surat, Bandra, Noida, and Karnataka know their families will starve and they will be prey to predators if they don’t return to safety or to look after those they have left behind. They had left all that was familiar and loved for a better life. Now they are opting for a life of subsistence among their own rather than with strangers in cities who have used them and then let them go.It is now six weeks into a lengthening national lockdown, albeit with some easing of restrictions. The most visible presence of the armed forces has been to shower petals on hospitals and engage in fly pasts from north to south and east to west.The Indian Army does many laudable things. There were reports that in the early days of the lockdown it contributed medical equipment and manpower. The Army has the mandate to come to the aid of the civilian authority whenever there is a national need. It is stationed everywhere across the country; it has tents, rations, and water supplies. It has transport vehicles to move people and food. Its men and resources are available at a very short distance from all arterial roads and highways used by the poor workers. It has managerial capabilities and an organised and disciplined force to move into action at a moment’s notice. None of the assistance they can offer would reduce their operational capabilities. If the risk of infection is a concern, the State can put in place adequate precautionary measures that do not hinder the work but minimise the risk. The Army knows how to minimise casualties. Even now, food water and resting halts can be arranged at regular distances as can isolation camps en route. The workers will understand if they are tested to see if they can go on or must rest in a quarantine area along the way. They will submit to quarantines where needed, if only they know that eventually they will be assisted to get home.It’s been six weeks. People are still walking. People are still thirsty. People are near starving. These are not ordinary people; they have built the country. They will build the country in the future. No favour is being done to them by providing them assistance to get to where they feel they belong. There is still time to save lives and win back trust. Galvanising the Army or even the paramilitary to assist these long marches will transform the everyday images of sorrow into those of joyful reunion. This is the right thing to do.Maja Daruwala is former director, Commonwealth Human Rights InitiativeThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/utilise-the-army-paramilitary-to-tackle-the-migrant-workers-crisis/story-rjN0uCXWmEWk8EfE6tEsDM.html
09-05-2020||News||The concept of ‘nudge’ can lead to social and economic change in India||Driving responsible individual behaviour to achieve collective well-being through public policy is not new to governments. During the coronavirus disease (Covid-19)-sparked crisis, the debate on what constitutes the realm of personal choice vis-à-vis collective responsibility is evolving faster than ever before. Governments are using behavioural change and ‘nudge’ theory to address myriad development and governance challenges. The idea gained traction after the United States (US) and the United Kingdom (UK) mainstreamed it by establishing “nudge” units. In India, behavioural change has been woven into programmes such as the Swachh Bharat Mission, Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao Yojna, and the PM Ujjwala Yojana. The government’s think-tank, NITI Aayog, also plans on setting up a formal nudge unit. The Covid-19 pandemic is unique in many ways: There are varying levels of risks for different age groups; there is an all-pervading threat to different socio-economic groups; and there is a need for individual-level impositions on the part of the government. These three are testing two vital elements of human behaviour. First, personal risk-seeking behaviours, and second, the degree to which an individual behaves in the benefit of society. The critical challenge here is to turn the situation around to implement reforms in behavioural change theory that were difficult so far. For example, now is the time to reinforce one of the key messages of the Swachh Bharat Mission: To encourage citizens to wash hands regularly. Children can be made champions of more hygienic behaviour in their families. The “20-second” hand wash rule, complemented by a “turn the tap off” message, can propel water-use optimisation behaviour.Similarly, to maintain social distance, the idea of using toilets constructed under the mission can be reiterated. In urban areas, the possibility of delays in doorstep waste collection can be used to drive home the point that there is an urgent need to improve waste management and begin segregation at home. A “my neighborhood, my hygiene” campaign can nudge urban citizens to care for their localities sustainably. On the economic front, learnings from “give up LPG subsidy” can be used to change the way such programmes work. The idea of market-based utility pricing can be piloted in the distribution companies and passenger services of Indian Railways by eliminating populist cross-subsidies. A nudge to pay taxes timely and rightfully this year can set a new benchmark for compliance, as people become more willing to contribute despite their economic hardships. As communities work closely with local health care cadre, focused messaging on reproductive, maternal, newborn, child, and adolescent health can improve health-seeking attitudes. With people experiencing stress and anxiety, authorities can encourage them to look at their lifestyles holistically by practising wellness guidelines of the National AYUSH Mission. With nurses and female doctors emerging as the heroes in the fight against the coronavirus, a renewed Beti Bachao Beti Padhao campaign, highlighting women’s critical role in the country’s success can improve gender outcomes. Similarly, a systematic behavioural change to arrest the flow of misinformation through social media can be achieved by nudging citizens to think about information accuracy before taking any action. With governments going online, many procedures can either be eliminated or digitised with minimal resistance from employees and citizens alike. This is also an opportune moment to promote digital payments. Given the changing role of police officers from law- enforcers to social collaborators, a systematic change in their public perception can improve civic-safety outcomes. With the young voluntarily helping the old procure, essential commodities, the concept of community-led geriatric care can also be promoted.Such top-down measures complemented by bottom-up initiatives can ensure that change becomes permanent. In this context, the role of panchayati raj institutions becomes critical. Integrating behavioural change in gram panchayat development plans can be a step in the direction towards leveraging these grassroots capacities.However, we must keep in mind the fallout of “soft paternalism” and typical impediments such as “dragons of inaction”, and “behavioural fatigue” while attempting to use the theory of behavioural change. One must use the idea of nudging and behavioural public policy cautiously. If correctly utilised and well executed, it has the potential to drastically alter the level of trust among citizens, thereby changing the nature of the “government–citizen” relationship forever. It can upgrade citizenry, improve democratic outcomes, and enhance the public services’ efficiency in the longer run.Sanyukta Samaddar is adviser, and Sumitra K. and Anand Trivedi are monitoring and evaluation lead and specialist, Niti Aayog respectively.The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/the-concept-of-nudge-can-lead-to-social-and-economic-change-in-india/story-lOOnlAdXAhNKe5mBe0OubN.html
09-05-2020||City||As pandemic rages, manufacturers, service providers must increase warranty, push back submission dates||Covid-19 and the resultant lockdown have created many unexpected, peculiar situations. For example, when an Octogenarian resident of Bengaluru decided to deposit Rs 15 lakhs in the Pradhan Mantri Vaya Vandana Yojana (PMVVY), he never thought that Covid-19 would come in the way of his investment.A pension scheme for senior citizens, PMVVY, implemented through the Life Insurance Corporation of India, offers an assured return of 8 per cent for ten years. On March 17, the 83-year old man met an LIC agent , who explained the benefits of the scheme to him and said the scheme closed on March 31. The senior citizen immediately rushed to a couple of banks in which he had the money, put Rs 15 lakhs together (the maximum deposit accepted under the scheme) in one account and on March 21, handed over the cheque and the filled form and other required documents to the agent, who in turn gave them to a development officer the same day. This was to be deposited in the LIC office on Monday, March 23, well ahead of the March 31 deadline.However, as luck would have it, Karnataka announced lockdown of nine districts including Bengaluru from March 23 and the Octogenarian’s money and form could not be deposited by the development officer in the LIC office. The senior citizen says he tried to make the payment online, but could not do so with his Rupay/debit card limitations. So his cheque and the form are stuck with the development officer and his hope of earning a decent return on his investment hangs in the balance. Locked down at home, he’s now desperately writing to the finance ministry, the LIC, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority and even the higher courts, urging that his application and cheque be accepted, as the delay in submission of the form and money was caused on account of circumstances beyond his control.I am sure there are many other senior citizens like him, who are in this predicament and it is only just and fair that their applications are accepted. In fact because of the lockdown, many senior citizens have lost a great opportunity to invest in a good pension scheme in the last week of March and earn a decent interest on their investment in this age of fluctuating and low interest rates on savings. So the government must respond positively to the appeal by the All India Senior Citizens’ Confederation to postpone the last date for submission of deposits in the scheme.It has already deferred the last date for tax saving investments from March 31 to June 30. Even for linking Pan Card to Aadhar card, the deadline has been extended to June 30. There should be similar extension of the cut off date for the Pradhan Mantri Vaya Vandana Yojana to June 30While on the subject of deadlines and time limits, I must mention that today, several companies are on their own extending the warranties in view of the lockdown and informing the customers. This must become universal and all manufacturers and service providers, without any exception , should suitably stretch beyond the earlier deadline, their warranties and guarantees, service contracts and extended warranties. For example, there should be an extension of time for free check up and servicing for all new vehicles- keeping in mind the fact that the vehicles have not moved at all during the lockdown. Likewise, the time limit for free servicing of all machines, including home appliances and air conditioners should be adjusted depending on when the lockdown is lifted. Similar logic should apply to paid service contracts and too. Battery manufacturers/dealers should also offer special schemes/ assistance to vehicle owners whose batteries may have died down due to non-use. Lives of many batteries could have also got reduced because of disuse.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/as-pandemic-rages-manufacturers-service-providers-must-increase-warranty-push-back-submission-dates/story-Qp6qctb4H1XJwZ21EfSSyK.html

He had made the payment for requisite development charges to the Beed municipal council on November 8, 2019.However, in March 2020, the civic body noticed that substantial construction of the new hospital building was already done, even before the building permit was obtained. On April 13, the civic body refused the building permission.On April 20, Dr Munde requested the district collector for permission to operate the hospital, claiming that the new building was already constructed and could be used for treating Covid-19 patients.He moved the HC after the resident collector on April 25 issued an order shortlisting the unfinished building for treatment of Covid-19 patients. The building would then be used for the purpose but the illegal status of the structure would not be lifted.Government pleader DR Kale opposes the doctor’s plea, stating that the construction was illegal and could not be allowed to be completed.Justice Ravindra Ghuge on Friday accepted his contention and rejected the doctor’s plea for interim permission to complete the unfinished building and to operate an OPD and a dialysis unit there. The judge said such an interim order “cannot be granted in the face of the illegality, prima facie, indulged by the petitioner”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-denies-permission-to-complete-illegal-hospital-to-treat-covid-19-patients/story-uzGriQKmOqRBpoaJRGBRLI.html

The incident took place in Shiv Vatika area in Dadri, where the victim, Dushyant, was fixing the transformer and the power supply suddenly came back. The victim was critically injured and got stuck to the transformer for sometime before being rescued. He has been admitted to Safdarjung hospital in Delhi with 50% burn injuries.Krishna Kumar Saraswat, executive engineer, Pashchimanchal Vidyut Vitaran Nigam Limited (PVVNL), said the incident took place on Thursday night. “The lineman is a contractual worker with the Chitehra power sub-station. He was fixing a transformer in Shiv Vatika area, where the incident took place. The power came back suddenly and he could not get down from the transformer. He received severe burn injuries in the incident,” he said. According to the police, the lineman went to the area to check the transformer, after getting complaints from people about frequent tripping and fluctuations in the neighbourhood homes which were connected to the transformer. “Local people spotted him and informed police and the power department. The power supply was discontinued and the victim was brought down. He was then rushed to Safdarjung Hospital for medical treatment,” said Dinesh Singh, station house officer(SHO), Dadri police station. He said that the power department has filed a complaint in this matter. “The complaint is informatory in nature. The victim’s family has not filed any complaint in this matter,” he said.Saraswat said that the victim is in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) but he is responding to medical treatment. “He is out of danger. The power department has launched a probe into the matter. The investigation will reveal if there was back-feeding or the transformer had some technical glitches,” he said. The Dadri police have cordoned off the area and advised people not to venture out for safety.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lineman-critically-injured-while-fixing-transformer-in-dadri/story-mUeISRRq8IhRZW3dzOfleK.html

More and more people from across the city have started contributing to the initiative, which also has the support of the Noida authority. In the beginning, at least 500 families had contributed two chapatis each. And now around 50,000 rotis per day are being collected and provided to the Noida authority’s community kitchen from where they reach the needy. Between April 13 and May 8, the bank has made more than 650,000 rotis. On April 12, a handful of apartment owners from Sector 78’s three housing complexes -- Antriksh Golf View 1, Golf View 2, Assotech Windsor Court -- and Sector 79’s Sportswood had started the ‘Roti Bank’. They did not think the idea will inspire so many city residents to come forward to help the homeless and jobless people during the Covid-19 pandemic.“We have got 655,300 rotis from residents from April 13 to May 8. And the number is increasing daily as more and more residents are contributing,” said Ritu Maheshwari, chief executive officer of Noida authority.Within a week after launch of the initiative, residents of around 20 societies in 7X sectors (74, 75, 76, 77, 78 and 79) started contributing to it. “Now, residents from sectors such as 21, 25, 26, 34, 49, 51, 70, 93, 104, 108, 110, 119, 122, 137 and 143 have also joined the initiative. Some housing societies from Greater Noida have also started sending rotis. The initiative is daily helping 9,300 needy people to get food. So far, it has helped 142,150 people,” said another Noida authority official, requesting anonymity.To begin with, the residents had requested via WhatsApp groups and other social networking sites for two rotis from each family daily for the next two weeks. The residents have to hand over the rotis to security guards at the gates, from where authority representatives collect them daily in the evening to deliver the same to homeless and migrant workers.“We all have a duty to help the needy during this crisis because the government alone cannot provide food for so long. We hope the entire city will come forward and ensure nobody sleeps hungry during the pandemic,” said Amita Singh, a resident of Sector 76.The Noida authority is running five community kitchens -- Shani temple Sector 14A, Harola Sector 5, Bhangel, Sorkha and Mamura for the poor. Rotis from nearby housing complexes reach the kitchens, said the officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/roti-bank-in-noida-generates-50-000-chapatis-daily-for-the-needy/story-C2kAt2XYuqmRvE62mFRmLO.html

09-05-2020||Noida||Noida: Vehicle headlights used to conduct health checkup of 35 evacuated persons from Singapore||The 35 persons who were among those evacuated from Singapore were given a check-up under the headlights of vehicles as there was no electricity apparatus at the Community Health Centre (CHC) in Noida’s Bhangel. The health centre comes under the health department of the Gautam Budh Nagar district. According to the 35 returnees, there weren’t any tube lights or bulbs at the facility. The travellers alleged they had to wait for over three hours to get their temperature and blood pressure checked and that too in the dark. They added that all of them were checked in an open area at the CHC where there was no light, after which administration officials switched on the headlights of their vehicles to provide some light.“It is unbelievable that health facilities in Uttar Pradesh are so bad that they are screening people in the dark. Officials had to use the headlights of their vehicles to lighten the area where we were made to wait to get ourselves checked. We were made to wait for over three hours just to get our temperature and blood pressure checked,” said a 27-year-old lawyer from Ghaziabad who was evacuated from Singapore.The returnees added the hotel where they are staying has not provided even basic facilities such as water, nor are there any room services, despite having to pay Rs 2,000 per day for a paid quarantine. “The Bhangel CHC area was full of mosquitoes. I had to drink tap water at the hotel as the hotel officials didn’t provide me with water for a long time. We are paying for the quarantine so at least basic facilities should be provided,” said a 39-year-old engineer from Ghaziabad.Out of the 35 persons evacuated from Singapore, six are from the Noida district while the rest belong to Kanpur, Ghaziabad, Agra, Deoria and Lucknow. Initially, it was decided that people who are from the district will be put under institutional quarantine while others will be sent back to their hometowns. These 35 persons, meanwhile, added that no social distancing was maintained at the CHC when they were taken for the checkup.“There was so much confusion on Friday evening as we were told we will be going to our homes but then they informed us that all of us will have to be put under institutional quarantine for 14 days. We are paying for the quarantine but we aren’t even getting water on time. I had to drink tap water in the night as the hotel staff did not provide water despite many calls,” said another person from the group.All the persons have been put under quarantine at the Savoy Suites at Pari Chowk which has been developed into a paid quarantine centre by the district administration. The 35 persons also alleged they got no help in lifting their heavy luggage at the airport and the hotel.“We were told that nobody will help us in shifting our luggage as they are scared of getting infected. There is a passenger here with two small children and she was struggling in putting her luggage inside the bus carrying us from the airport. At the hotel also, nobody helped us carry our luggage. The UP roadways bus which had come to pick us up was dirty,” said a 50-year-old passenger who was evacuated along with his wife.“They are charging me Rs 2,000-plus-taxes per person so we are paying over Rs 4,000 for the two of us. They told us they can provide only four bottles of packaged water each day and we will have to pay extra if we need more. The quality of food is so bad that you can’t eat it. Though they are charging us, no extra towels, bed sheets, soap or water is provided to us,” added the man.The district magistrate, meanwhile, pulled up his officers over conducting the health checkup of these 35 persons under the vehicle headlights, in the absence of electricity paraphernalia. “I have spoken to officials and we are looking into the matter. We have been trying to address all the issues of these people,” said district magistrate Suhas LY.These persons have also said that there are no windows in the rooms as there is a centralized air-condition system, which has been switched off. “ACs are not allowed and there are no windows in the rooms, so we have to keep our doors open the whole day to get some fresh air,” said a college student from the group.“We are trying to provide all possible services to the 35 persons but their issues will be conveyed to the concerned senior authorities,” said a hotel staff at the Savoy Suites, Greater Noida, requesting anonymity. Gautam Budh Nagar chief medical officer, Dr Deepak Ohri, could not be reached for a comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-vehicle-headlights-used-to-conduct-health-checkup-of-35-evacuated-persons-from-singapore/story-078ddZPTZBDVbsgaQq5GCO.html
09-05-2020||City||Ghaziabad: Source of virus from random sampling difficult to ascertain, say health officials||Six samples, out of nearly 800 random ones collected from hotspots in the last fortnight, have tested positive for Covid-19, raising concerns among health workers about tracing the source or contact of the virus.Till Friday, Ghaziabad had recorded a total of 133 cases, which included about 29 cases that were linked to hospital acquired infection, officials said. They added that six cases emerged by random sampling from densely populated and low-economic class areas.“About 700-800 random samples was collected from hotspot areas, where we have found six positive cases. The emergence of such cases is slightly worrying as the source of such infection is difficult to ascertain. We have found two such cases from Khoda, three from Islam Nagar and one from Jhandapur in Sahibabad. We cannot comment if these cases were due to community spread as such,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer of Ghaziabad.“We are taking 30 to 40 random samples in different hotspot areas each day and trying to find out if there is any spread . The prime focus area for us now is Khoda ,where at least 15 people have tested positive. We have asked the administration to strictly enforce the lockdown and sealing in the locality,” he added.In a rare instance in Ghaziabad, the officials said that no positive cases were found on Saturday and total number of cases stood at 133.Till Saturday evening, the number of sampling done in Ghaziabad stood at 4,321 with reports of 573 still awaited. Across the state, the number of samples tested on Friday stood at 4,525.Among the initial cases in Ghaziabad, people having travel history tested positive. Later, cases linked to a religious congregation in Nizamuddin area of Delhi emerged. A few cases were also traced back to Noida-based fire safety and security solutions company, Ceasefire.“The latest cases which are coming in are medically acquired infection in which patients undergoing treatment or healthcare workers have tested positive. We have about 29 such cases where health care workers have tested positive so far. The two deaths which have resulted so far are due to comorbid conditions. There are several cases where we are yet to trace the source of infection and are awaiting reports,” he added.The officials said that the source of infection of a 60-year-old woman (who died) from Pratap Vihar, Vijay Nagar is yet to be ascertained and test reports of her family members are yet to be received.“The other case is of the additional regional manager from Aligarh and his four of his family members, who tested positive. A woman from Jhapdapur, who died in Delhi, also has five family members who tested positive on Friday. It has come to light that contacts of patients carrying the virus are often testing positive owing to families staying closely together and sharing bedrooms, utensils. So, it becomes vital that social distancing is maintained within the family as well,” CMO added.The officials of Uttar Pradesh government said that the recovery rate of the state at present is about 43% which is higher than the national rate of about 30%.“With the process of sampling and testing intensified, there is lot of stress on community surveillance as more migrant workers and people from foreign countries are being brought in. We are in the process of forming gram samitis in rural areas and mohalla samitis in urban areas, who will keep track of people coming from outside and will send them to home quarantine after medical examination,” said Amit Mohan Prasad, UP’s principal secretary (health).According to officials, about 12,4791 people have been tested in the state with the help of government and private laboratories. The state at present has 449 hotspot areas with a population of 47.29 lakh people residing in about 8.34 lakh houses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-source-of-virus-from-random-sampling-difficult-to-ascertain-say-health-officials/story-G6HppqJ4dI2gfPrxdvCofI.html
09-05-2020||Mumbai||No need to test tiger cub for Covid: Forest department||The state forest department has decided not to send swab samples of a three-month-old tiger cub from Chandrapur to one of the approved animal testing centres for Covid-19 in Bhopal. The cub was the first wild animal in Maharashtra suspected of being infected with Covid-19. However, after forest officials said the cub is not showing any symptoms of the infection, the chief wildlife warden decided against testing the cub’s samples. Initially, the department had planned to send the cub’s samples to National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases, in Bhopal. “Many days have passed since the rescue, and the animal currently shows no symptoms of ill health. Also logistical issues such as interstate transport will be a tedious task. We will monitor the cub’s health and in case there are issues, a follow-up decision will be taken,” said Nitin Kakodkar, principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife). The department hopes to reunite the cub with her mother. Scat samples were collected of a tigress less than two kilometres from the spot where the cub was rescued on April 24. “The scat and swab samples of the tigress and the cub have been sent to an institute in Hyderabad for DNA analysis. If the results are positive, the process to reunite them will commence,” said a forest official.On April 24, the female cub was rescued from Sushi Dabgaon village, around 60 km from Chandrapur, and is currently at a transit treatment centre. After concerns were raised by non-government bodies that the cub was rescued without Covid-19 protective equipment, swab samples were collected on April 28 and sent to Nagpur Veterinary College (NVC). Earlier this week NVC returned the samples as they are not authorised by the Centre to conduct tests for Covid-19.Independent experts concurred with the forest department’s decision. “There is no reason for us to worry or panic about this cub’s safety. Since the animal is asymptomatic, there is no point testing samples similar to the protocol for humans,” said Anish Andheria, president, Wildlife Conservation Trust. “Different types of coronaviruses are carried by animals and this particular strain affecting humans can also be carried by cats. While some tigers in Bronx Zoo in New York contracted Covid-19, there is no case across the world where any big cat has died.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/no-need-to-test-tiger-cub-for-covid-forest-department/story-ORdlzM9b5lh94dKOcqkyFP.html

The driver’s wife also tested positive. So, on the advice of the health department officials, we are on 14-day quarantine since April 27. I and the other officers work from office nowadays and are not going home. All 40 staff members as well as their families who are living on the station premises are now in home quarantine.”The firefighters are involved in sanitisation work in different parts of the city, including those in hot spot areas.“Our administrative work is going on from Vaishali fire station but no personnel is going out to the field. We are still coordinating work over phone and the rest of the stations are engaged in sanitisation and firefighting activities.

According to the officials, the woman is a resident of sector 128 and her husband is a constable with the Delhi police. The woman had complained of vomiting after which she was taken to the district hospital in sector 30 of Noida.Doctors at the district hospital suspected her of having Covid-19 and her sample was collected for testing. On May 6, the condition of the woman deteriorated after which she was referred to GIMS, where she died during the treatment within an hour of being admitted.“The woman was brought to us on May 6 in a critical condition from the district hospital. She died during treatment. She was suspected to have Covid-19 and her reports are still pending. We have spoken to the chief medical officer to get her reports as soon as possible so that we can release the body as per laid down protocols,” said Dr Rakesh Gupta, director, GIMS.The health officials have sent her sample to the National Institute of Biologicals in Noida. On Saturday, officials asked the NIB authorities to provide the woman’s reports on a priority basis as her family members have been struggling to claim the body to perform her last rites.“We were informed about the woman by the chief medical superintendent of the district hospital. Her samples were collected during treatment. We expect her reports to be handed over to us by Sunday morning,” said Dr Deepak Ohri, chief medical officer, GB Nagar.The family members of the woman are also worried as they don’t know if she was Covid positive or not, as many people had come in contact with her before May 6.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/body-of-55-yr-old-lies-at-gims-mortuary-as-authorities-wait-for-covid-report/story-dGSMcfTR6zF4oqmV1aNwFM.html
09-05-2020||Noida||For domestic workers, working for a single household is not an option||For hundreds of domestic workers in the district, implementation of a new set of guidelines issued by the Gautam Buddh Nagar administration regarding the resumption of work would mean a major loss of income. The district administration, on May 6, issued new guidelines, asking the residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) and local residents’ bodies of the district to come up with strategies to ensure that only one domestic help works for one household and that they only come from a non-containment zone. While many domestic workers were unaware of the new guidelines, those who were expressed their dilemma. “One of my employers told me that although I can resume work, I can only work for one household. I work in five places and get similar money from all of them. How can I choose only a single household? I got payments from all families for the month of April but that is not the case this month. Only one of them has paid me completely. Two have given me half my pay, but have promised to help me out with ration if the need arises. Two of the rest haven’t paid anything. Although we can start work now, we are yet to gain access into the society. This way, we are neither getting any money nor work. How long can we go on like this,” said Azeema, a domestic help, who works for two societies in Sector 76.Domestic helps are also not comfortable with working only for one household because they feel that in this way they will lose on other sources of income.“Why will one family pay me as much as rest of the households combined? Even if I do more work for a family, they will not pay me as much as working for three or four families. Why will others continue to pay me if I work only in one house? Further, our landlord is not letting us go to work. He says it’s too risky and that no one is going out. I have not been able to go to collect my salary. He said when everything opens then we can go but, in the meantime, he has refused to help us in any way,” said Rekha, who lives in Harijan Colony and works as a domestic help in Arun Vihar.Most residential bodies in the district have refused the entry of the domestic help due to the non-feasibility of the one-household rule. “For high-rises, with several hundred flats, it is impossible to have only one domestic help per house. So we are currently discouraging the entry of maids and have requested the families that if they really need help, the maids should stay with them on a 24-hour basis and that the families should get them tested,” said Rajiva Singh, president, Noida Federation of Apartment Owners Associations(NOFAA).However, for domestic workers, who work for only a few hours on a daily basis, living with one family for the whole day is also impossible. “I didn’t know that we are only allowed to work for one family. I cannot choose which family to work for. One of my employers is an elderly couple, another family has two toddlers. Even if I could choose one, staying with them for the whole day or even from 7am-7pm is not possible. I have four kids and I cannot leave them unattended for the whole day,” said Sarita, who works as a cook.Despite repeated attempts, the district magistrate could not be reached for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/for-domestic-workers-working-for-a-single-household-is-not-an-option/story-KMjNKW4fMl9Lr7PvjNGI3M.html
09-05-2020||City||No one cares if we live or die, say migrants walking back home along railway tracks||In the scorching 40 degrees-plus heat on Saturday afternoon, Ramakant Pahayar, who used to work at a hotel in Lal Kuan near Ghaziabad, and six others had stopped under the shade of a tree near Greater Noida’s Maripat railway station to catch their breath and eat their meagre rations -- some salt, a few boiled potatoes and a water bottle. The group has a long way to go; about 700km to be precise, to reach their village of Bhatanwara in Panna, Madhya Pradesh. They have been keeping away from the national highways to avoid police checkpoints and have been walking along the Delhi-Howrah railway tracks for 10 kilometres so far. Penniless and jobless ever since nationwide lockdown was imposed on March 24, Ramakant along with his fellow travellers from Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and remote parts of Uttar Pradesh, have been struggling to survive in NCR, often having to go without food and shelter. With no government or employer coming to their help, they decided to walk back home to the safety of their villages.“No one here -- neither our landlord, our maalik (employer) nor the government -- cares if we live or die. Three meals a day has become a dream and it’s not possible for me to starve every day. We don’t know when this lockdown will end -- we felt walking back to our home would be a better idea than to starve and die here. There is no food, our landlord is pressurising us for rent, and the government is not arranging us transport; what option do we have but to walk?” said Ramakant when asked what made him leave his rented room in Ghaziabad.Since the journey is long, and he had little resources, Ramakant decided tot ag along with Rinku, another daily wager from Panna, carrying with them some potatoes they got from their neighbours. On the route, they met four other migrants from Bihar, and the group decided to stick together till Agra. Those who were heading to Bihar said they had at least a 1,200km ahead of them, but seemed mentally prepared to tackle it.“I would never return. I would rather do anything in our village -- help the family with farming or something, but I won’t return. I decided this before leaving my room. We cannot travel by road as the police would beat us. We will follow these railway tracks to Agra, from there we will see which track goes to Jhansi or Gwalior or we will try to hitchhike with truckers from the highway. We will have to figure something out but returning is not an option,” said Rinku, who washed dishes at a dhaba in Ghaziabad.Asked if he knew that the government was arranging transport, he said he neither knew about shelter homes, not the transport arrangements, not did anyone from the administration inform him or the others about all this.Deepak Kumar, another daily wager who used to live in Roza Jalalpur village of Greater Noida, said a return to one’s roots was always the better option. Deepak, who hailed from Purnia district, was travelling along with Pankaj Kumar and Pramod Kuma, who are also from his district.“The police were stopping us and that is why we had to take the railway tracks. We know that this track goes to Bihar, via Kanpur and Allahabad. For now we will go to Dadri, and try to hitchhike, but if nobody offers us ride, then we will stick to the tracks. It will take us at least 10 days to reach home, but that’s okay,” Deepak said.Pramod Kumar said the decision to walk back home was the last option for many.“The meals served in the community kitchen in our area were irregular; sometimes just once a day, sometimes twice in three days, and they would give ration only to a few people. Our landlord has been asking for rent -- what option did we have? The government is not arranging buses or trains, and even when they did, we were told that it’s only for people in Delhi,” Pramod Kumar said.Fifty-year-old Ram Asarey, who hails from a village in Aligarh, was another who preferred taking the railway track back home, along with his wife and son. Ram Asarey, who worked at a stone crushing unit in Ghaziabad and lived in Shahberi village, Greater Noida, said amid the uncertainty brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic, he felt that going home was a better option.“Our ration and savings are both gone. Besides our entire family lives in Aligarh. We don’t know how long this lockdown would continue, so walking back home to our village seemed a better option,” Asarey said.According to Ramesh Chandra Meena, the gateman at Chaproli railway crossing in Greater Noida, hundreds of migrants had been walking along the tracks ever since the lockdown was extended from May 3 to May 17. “The maximum people pass by this point early morning or late evening. But the exodus along the tracks continues throughout the day. Yesterday, people from neighbouring Jaunsivana village even distributed food to the migrants. There are women and children; all walking back home. Some even stopped by to enquire where this track would lead,” Meena said.When contacted, a few senior officials of the district administration said they had heard that migrants from Rajasthan were sent back home, however they were unclear on the numbers and future plans.“There were a few migrants who were sent back home to Rajasthan. It is unclear how many of them were sent home, but the numbers were close to 70. We are unclear if migrants from other areas will also be sent back home,” said a senior official from the Gautam Budh Nagar administration, on condition of anonymity.“I am not apprised of the migrant situation, will inform once the information reaches me,” said SB Singh, district social welfare officer, GB Nagar, further stating that the additional divisional magistrate (administration) E Diwakar Singh was looking after the migrant crisis.Singh, however, could not be reached despite a number of calls and messages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-one-cares-if-we-live-or-die-say-migrants-walking-back-home-along-railway-tracks/story-0NNf4FC5AOILXKoQF33hTL.html
09-05-2020||Mumbai||Colleges heads seek clarity on minister’s decision on MU exams||A day after the state minister for higher and technical education Uday Samant announced that all university students except final year undergraduate and post-graduate students will be promoted to the next academic year, principals are awaiting a final word from the University of Mumbai (MU) for clarity.Many colleges are still unclear on which of the two 50:50 formulas, one suggested by the University Grants Commission (UGC) and one by the state government, need to be implemented.UGC has recommended that colleges promote first and second year students, 50% based on a student’s performance in internal tests and other projects in the current semester and the remaining 50% on previous semester’s performance. The state education minister, however, suggested that a 50% of a student’s assessment should be based on this year’s performance and 50% on that of the previous year. “Unaided courses, including Bachelor of Management Studies and Bachelor of Mass Media have 25 marks set aside for internals in every subject for internals, and most colleges can use the UGC formula since they have completed these evaluations,” said Parag Thakkar, in-charge principal, HR College, Churchgate. “But traditional courses (BCom, BA and BSc) have only theory papers for 100 marks, and no internals marks to grade students.” He added that they are waiting for a final word from the university on the gradation formula for promoting students.Many colleges are also unsure about attendance rule as suggested by Samant. According to MU rules, a student requires a minimum of 75% attendance.“Many colleges, including our college had already issued notices to attendance defaulters and barred them from examination,” said Anju Kapoor, principal of UPG College, Vile Parle. “Now that the minister has asked us to allow all students to be promoted despite attendance deficit, we will follow this rule,” he said. A statement released by MU late on Saturday stated that the varsity is preparing an action plan for the academic schedule with the planning of 158 examinations in the final session of the final year of diploma, undergraduate and post-graduate courses. “About 2,22,581 students will be enrolled for the final session of the final year and for 158 examinations as per the annual examination system,” said an official from MU.However, around 500 students from Mithibai Autonomous College, who were debarred from appearing for exams due to attendance deficit, are still unsure about the scenario. Of these students, 107 had moved the Bombay high court seeking to be allowed to appear for exams, which was rejected by the court in March, before the lockdown was implemented. “We are hoping the attendance relaxation rule will be applicable to us as well, and we will be considered for promotion to the next academic year,” said a student.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/colleges-heads-seek-clarity-on-minister-s-decision-on-mu-exams/story-gsmV7SHmIipYH1BLzOUjdI.html
09-05-2020||City||18 migrant workers held for cycling from Noida to Bihar||Eighteen migrant workers who were cycling from Noida to Bihar were sent to a shelter home by the Badalpur police on Friday. The police booked them for violating the lockdown norms and seized their bicycles as well. Patneesh Kumar, station house officer, Badalpur police station, said the workers were stopped near Patwari Bagh area in Badalpur around 1pm. “The workers were not wearing masks. They were keen on continuing their cycle journey to their home towns. We informed them that this is not only illegal but also unsafe,” he said. Most of the workers are from Purnia and Katihar, in Bihar.“The workers were taken to a shelter home. We have registered a case against them under Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the Indian Penal Code and Section 51 of the Disaster Management Act 2005.”Kumar said the Gautam Budh Nagar district administration is making arrangements to send the stranded migrants to their home towns. “We will arrange some buses and send them home accordingly, till then they will stay in the shelter home,” he said.Meanwhile, a group of migrant workers also gathered near Sector Delta 1 in Surajpur area of Greater Noida Saturday morning and demanded the local administration to facilitate their journey to Bihar. The workers, who all live in rented homes in Bhiraundi village, alleged that their landlords were pressuring them to pay rent. The workers said they had run out of money after the nationwide lockdown was imposed, and can’t afford to buy food as well.Raju Kumar, a worker, said survival had become difficult in this lockdown for many like him. “Someone told us that the administration is going to arrange buses for Bihar, hence we came here (Sector Delta 1). We want to go back home as staying in Noida has become difficult,” he said.A team from Surajpur police reached the spot after getting information about the gathering. Pradeep Tripathi, station house officer, Surajpur police station, said the migrant workers were provided cooked meals and dry ration. “We have taken down their names and addresses. The police and the district administration will soon arrange some buses and send them home,” he said.The crowd dispersed after the police assured the workers they will be sent back home in a few days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/18-migrant-workers-held-for-cycling-from-noida-to-bihar/story-2Cr9EO6oJqAfvp2R9vskBJ.html

09-05-2020||Noida||GB Nagar reports 116 cases in past 20 days, first 100 cases were found in 40 days||Increased testing has helped the Gautam Budh Nagar health department identify 116 Covid-19 cases in the past 20 days in the district. The district, which has reported a total of 216 positive cases so far, took almost 40 days to reach its first 100 cases of coronavirus disease. The first Covid-19 case was registered in the district on March 12. Initially, the health department had limited testing kits which delayed the process of identifying a case at an early stage, officials said.According to the officials, increased number of testing and intensive contact tracing has resulted in identifying 116 cases in a span of 20 days. As per the reports of the district health department, 1,967 samples were collected between March 12 and April 20. However, in the last 20 days, between April 21 and May 9, officials collected 2,014 samples. In total, 3,981 samples have ben collected since the first case was found.In the last nine days, 78 cases were found in the district which included many health workers. The officials have been trying to increase the number of sampling in the district to identify people infected with Covid-19. There are around 100 cases where the exact source of infection isn’t known yet, the officials said.“Our officials have been focusing on contact tracing, which has helped us in identifying cases early. The number of random sampling has also increased. In total, 121 persons have already been discharged after successfully completing the treatment. The number of active cases, which is 93, is lesser than the recovered ones. Many persons who have been found positive were already under institutional quarantine, which has helped in containing the spread,” said Suhas LY, district magistrate.Experts said that the increased number of testing will result in identifying more cases. “The increase in number of cases is bound to happen. Around 95% of the cases are of mild symptoms or asymptomatic persons. It is important to pay attention in safeguarding older people and the ones with comorbid conditions,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head, community medicine, Safdarjung Hospital, Delhi.There are three big clusters in the district from where maximum cases have come up. Around 44 persons having direct or indirect links with the Ceasefire company in Sector 137 were found positive for the infection. Around 51 persons are found positive for the infection from the JJ Colony of sectors 8, 9 and 10. Till now, over 36 medical and paramedical staff of different hospitals have been found positive for Coronavirus. Remaining are either from small clusters or single cases.On Saturday, two new Covid-19 cases were found in the district, taking the total number of positive cases to 216 in the district. The two patients included a 62-year-old man from Sector 66 who was under the institutional quarantine at the Galgotias hostel in Greater Noida and was rushed to the Government Institute of Medical Sciences after he was found lying unconscious in his room on Friday evening. He was declared dead on arrival by the hospital authorities.The second patient is a 52-year-old man, a resident of Khajoor Colony in Sector 45 of Noida. His source of infection is yet to be identified, the officials said.By Saturday night, the health department collected a total of 3,981 samples. Currently, there are 93 active Covid-19 cases in the district and around 401 persons are under institutional quarantine. Two people have died due to Covid-19 infection in the past 24 hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/gb-nagar-reports-116-cases-in-past-20-days-first-100-cases-were-found-in-40-days/story-InhnP4Jj0TBHcN0ngSdciO.html
09-05-2020||Mumbai||Paper evaluation: Teachers worried about their travel||A few days after the state education department allowed teachers in the state to travel for SSC (Class 10) paper evaluation duties, many teachers have raised concerns over the decision. Teachers said there is a lot of risk involved in travelling, especially in areas demarcated as red zones. “Many teachers stay far away from their schools and might have to make two or three trips to the school to collect papers and to transport them back which will put them in risk. In such a situation, the government needs to increase the evaluation period to give more flexibility to teachers,” said Anil Bornare, coordinator of the BJP teachers’ front, which wrote to the department on May 8. Uday Nare, teacher at Hansraj Morarji Public School in Andheri, said, “Some window should be given at least for areas in red zones as the situation is worse in some places than others.” The Mumbai Divisional Board, which also consists of Thane, Raigad and Palghar, started issuing letters permitting teachers to travel from May 8. With the Supreme Court’s mandate that the board should declare results by June 10, the board has decided to try and finish evaluating and moderating answer sheets. The state board normally declares Class 12 results in the last week of May and Class 10 results by the second week of June.“We have spoken to concerned officials at the local level to facilitate travel for teachers. The idea is to finish as much pending work as possible so that results are not delayed. All precautions with respect to safety and social distancing should be followed in the process,” said Sandeep Sangave, secretary , Mumbai Divisional Board.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/paper-evaluation-teachers-worried-about-their-travel/story-g6VxJ9AIKtQE3aCUqI2CjO.html

09-05-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra sees rise in tiger attacks during lockdown||There has been a surge in the number of tiger attacks in Maharashtra during the lockdown, said the chief wildlife warden of the state forest department. Following representations from local villagers, one tigress, suspected of killing at least two people, has been tranquilised and sent to Gorewada Zoo in Nagpur. Twelve people have died due to tiger attacks during the lockdown in Maharashtra.Between March 23 and May 2, 11 deaths were recorded in five districts – two in Gadchiroli; two in Gondia; two in Bhandara; one in Pench Tiger Reserve (Maharashtra); and four in Chandrapur district (including two deaths in the buffer zone of Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve). All the deaths were of people who had entered protected areas to collect Mahua flowers or tendu leaves, the forest department said. On Saturday afternoon, 50-year-old Abhiman Narayan was mauled to death by a tiger near Kondhala village, in Gadchiroli district, after he had entered a forested zone to pick tendu leaves, said forest officials.“While isolated cases of conflict are witnessed annually, there is a spike this year, especially during lockdown,” said Nitin Kakodkar, principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife), Maharashtra. Overall, there have been 18 deaths recorded this year between January and April as compared to 23 throughout the year in 2019 and 25 in 2018. Tigers are moving freely outside core zones and in some cases, they’ve come closer to human-dominated areas during lockdown, leading to conflict. “Cases were restricted to the Chandrapur district in previous years, but a surge has been witnessed this year from other districts as well,” said Kakodkar.On April 23, the forest department issued a set of guidelines to all districts witnessing conflict, stressing that villagers should avoid going deep into the forest, especially the core area. “Deaths during forest produce collection have been happening annually but there is definitely a rise being witnessed this year not just in Maharashtra but other states as in central India as well. But villagers need to be more careful as they are aware of the dangers,” said Kishore Rithe, state wildlife board member.Villagers go into the forest to collect Mahua flowers —dried Mahua flowers are fermented to produce an alcoholic drink and the flowers have other uses too — and tendu leaves (Diospyros melonoxylon), which are mostly used to make bidis. This year, the Mahua, which usually blooms in early March, has bloomed in April. Nitin Desai, director (central India), Wildlife Protection Society of India, said dried Mahua flowers are selling for Rs 150 per kilogram and fresh flowers are selling for Rs 100 per kg in Maharashtra, compared to Rs 30-35 per kg in central India. One of the reasons for increased demand is the production of alcohol-based sanitiser. Wildlife activist Umeshsingh Zire said, “During the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, alcohol-based sanitiser industries, especially across Gadchiroli and Gondia, are following production methods being implemented by Madhya Pradesh, and paying villagers more for large quantities of dried Mahua flowers.”50 TIGERS TO BE TRANSLOCATED FROM CHANDRAPUROver the next three years, the forest department plans to translocate 50 of the 160 tigers from Chandrapur landscape, including tiger reserves, to address future conflict issues. “A proposal has been sent to the Maharashtra government to tranquilise and translocate 50 tigers to areas with fewer numbers, zoological parks or even other states with low tiger numbers,” said Kakodkar. The proposal is awaiting clearance from the state wildlife board, Maharashtra government and National Tiger Conservation Authority.State wildlife board member Kishore Rithe said translocating tigers would be a stop-gap measure since tigers were likely to breed again and increase their numbers in the area. “Rather than moving animals out of this zone, district planners need to identify villages falling in fragmented corridors and plan their translocation, which will be less tedious,” said Rithe.GONDIA FOREST DEPARTMENT TRANQUILISES TIGRESSOn Thursday, a two-year-old, sub-adult tigress (N1) — allegedly responsible for the death of two persons (during forest produce collection) in Gondia — was tranquilised and captured by the forest department. She was sent to Gorewada Zoo in Nagpur on Friday. Forest officers developed a contraption involving a cage set atop a tractor to tranquilise the animal. “After a few kills were reported from the Brahmapuri division in November and December last year, we had issued orders to capture the tigress but the animal could not be located. Earlier this year, we learnt the tiger had travelled from Chandrapur to Gondia where it made a few kills, including villagers collecting forest produce. Based on the deaths reported in the last week of April and another on May 2, capturing efforts were escalated. The operation was successful and the animal is healthy,” said Kakodkar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maha-sees-rise-in-tiger-attacks-during-lockdown/story-kERre4syjCupwg7NZzbYxK.html

The Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation (MMRC) has released its plans for the multi-storey buildings at Girgaum-Kalbadevi that will house 734 tenants from the 30 old buildings that were demolished for the Metro-3 (Colaba-Bandra-Seepz).One of the first known markets and business establishments in old Bombay, the multi-storey towers - Kalbadevi Heights, Kalbadevi Commercial Centre and Girgaon Heights - will bring in integrated development to the area, resulting in the widening of the congested JSS Road and is expected to attract more footfall to the areas with increased connectivity.“The three buildings will be completed and ready for occupancy in phases from 2022. The project may trigger more cluster/redevelopment opportunities in the area. The on-ground work is also expected to start soon,” said an MMRC spokesperson.The Kalbadevi Commercial Centre will also house ground plus two-storey fish market with separate entries, area for loading/unloading for the market and separate service lifts for the fish market and commercial units. It will house 33 commercial shops and 24 commercial offices.This week, MMRC floated a ₹395-crore tender for the 48-storey Girgaon Heights that will house 473 residential units, 137 commercial shops and 19 commercial offices. It has already awarded the contract for the 38-storey Kalbadevi Heights that will house 291 residential units and five commercial units.Under the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s Development Control Regulations 33(7), the six non-contiguous blocks are being developed as one cluster. The three other blocks will be utilised for Metro allied activities.Sandesh Samant, a resident of Girgaum and a professor, said the new development will bring in a big change in the Girgaum-Kalbadevi belt. “JSS road is one of the most prime roads and there have not been many redevelopment projects here,” Samant said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sobo-s-rehabilitation-project-for-metro-3-to-soon-take-shape/story-ZiLz5N1FenbTLCB8e467jK.html

Tagging the CM in a tweet, Mamta stated the fight against drugs was an election promise and the home delivery of liquor (which is also a drug) might lead to increase in cases of domestic violence amid lockdown. Further, she stated contractors were also not in favour of home delivery. Mamta said, “Liquor vends would eventually open, but home delivery should not be allowed.” The councillor said, “Another major reason to disallow home delivery of liquor is the presence of children in homes during lockdown. It will also have a bad impact on children.” She said liquor contractors have also been opposing home delivery citing shortage of workers. Meanwhile, vends remained closed in Ludhiana for the third consecutive day after the government allowed vends to open. The contractors are demanding compensation for the loss incurred during the last financial year and review of the excise policy and the withdrawal of quota condition. “The decision on whether to open the vends or not would be taken only after the outcome of the cabinet meeting on the excise policy,” said Varinder Sharma Bobby, leading the contractors.Going by the directions of the state government, the administration had, on Wednesday, allowed wine contractors to open the vends on Thursday last for counter sale from 9am to 3pm and home delivery till 6pm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mamta-ashu-urges-captain-amarinder-singh-not-to-allow-home-delivery-of-liquor/story-qxKPX6IyoFnK6DufsrBKPN.html

The accused, an architect living in south Mumbai’s Cumbala Hills, has been arrested by the police. The injured policemen have received multiple injuries. According to officers from Marine Drive police station, the accused, Karan Pradip Nair, was walking on the footpath from Chowpatty to Marine Drive with a chopper in his hand around 1.30am on Saturday.Marine Drive police officers, who were on a nakabandi duty near Pransukhlal Mafatlal Hindu Swimming Bath and Boat Club asked him to stop after seeing the chopper in his hand. But Nair continued to run towards Marine Drive, following which some police officers chased him.“Our men tried to overpower him when he stopped, but he threatened them and tried to assault them with the chopper. He even attacked an officer on the neck, but the officer managed to dodge him and sustained injury on his shoulder. Two other officers sustained injuries on their hands,” said Mrityunjay Hiremath, senior police inspector.The injured police personnel – a night round police inspector Jitendra Kadam, sub-inspector Sachin Shelke and constable Sagar Shelke – were taken to Sir JJ Hospital for medical aid and were released after primary medication. They were not admitted at the hospital as they would have been at risk of contracting Covid-19, Hiremath said.The accused is an architecture graduate who is currently unemployed and lives with his mother and younger sister in a Cumbala Hill house which he owns on a pagdi system. “Preliminary probe revealed that before leaving his home on Saturday, Nair had a heated argument with his mother wherein he got angry and threatened to kill someone and left with the chopper, which is otherwise used for cutting trees,” said Hiremath. The police is further investigating the case. Nair has been charged under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code, Arms Act and Maharashtra Police Act. He would be produced in court on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/man-attacks-3-cops-with-choppers-at-marine-drive-held/story-qREWQWqTdvV0pUolis15mL.html
09-05-2020||Mumbai||BMC aims to increase Covid doubling rate to 20 days by May 17||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), in a bid to bring down the number of Covid-19 cases in the city, which has crossed the 11,000-mark, aims to increase the doubling rate in the city to 20 days from the current 10 by May 17. On April 26, there were 5,407 cases in the city, which doubled to 11,394 on Thursday. To increase the doubling rate, the civic body has planned measures such as enforcing lockdown in containment zones, conducting aggressive house-to-house surveys, opening more fever clinics, identifying vulnerable senior citizens and admitting more number of suspected patients. BMC has deployed a team of seven senior Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officers and has assigned each of them with a zone. Every day, the officers will visit their respective zones and conduct briefings via video conferences. The IAS officers assigned with the task include additional municipal commissioners A Jarhad, Jayashree Bhoj and P Velrasu; additional municipal commissioner (health) Suresh Kakani; Covid-19 task force member Manisha Mhaiskar; former Navi Mumbai civic commissioner Dr N Ramaswami and former Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation managing director Ashwini Bhide.The deployment was decided in a meeting with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and members of the central government team on Thursday. A circular issued by outgoing civic commissioner Praveen Pardeshi stated, “The above mentioned additional municipal commissioners will ensure actions in most effective and efficient manner so as to improve the positive case doubling rate from the current 10 days to 20 days by May 17, 2020. They will personally visit their zones every day from morning till 2pm and attend office post 3pm. A debriefing will be taken by the undersigned [Pardeshi] daily at 6pm via video conferencing. They will mobilise staff to get the works entrusted to them from all resources.”The action plan drafted by BMC read, “Mapping of positive cases, contact tracing, high risk, low risk etc. Strict enforcement of containment zones, house to house survey, identifying comorbid senior citizens and their further treatment, fever clinics, facilitate private nursing homes, clinics, hospitals to operate followed by testing of symptomatic persons, creation and operation of health infrastructure, community participation by involvement of community leaders.”A deputy municipal commissioner who attended Thursday’s meeting, said, “There is no special technique to increase the doubling rate of positive cases in the city, but if we conduct an aggressive door-to-door survey and identify suspects, we are able to minimise the transmission. This indirectly will increase our doubling rate in the city. Increasing the doubling rate does not means we have to detect lesser cases, but it means early detection to prevent further spread.”The officer added, “The increase in the detection of cases each day will mean that despite rise in cases, we are detecting and isolating patients, by which we are avoiding transmission. This will bring down the doubling rate in the coming days.”The BMC has has projected around 75,000 cases by end of the month going at the present rate. It said that though the curve is not going up drastically, it is preparing for a worst-case scenario.Nikhil Desai, a civic activist from Matunga, said, “There are so many complaints that people are not getting tested or getting admitted despite having symptoms relating to coronavirus. Despite claims of increased number of beds at hospitals and testing capacity, the fact is citizens are not able to get tested or admitted. Also, despite the fact that many senior citizens are at greater risk, there is no proper identification of elderly patients with suspected symptoms.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-aims-to-increase-covid-doubling-rate-to-20-days-by-may-17/story-mtvGJAHO4Pwuodg0ihhN2L.html

09-05-2020||Delhi||JNU revises academic calendar, allows students to return to campus in June||Releasing a revised academic calendar, Jawaharlal Nehru University on Saturday said its students may return to campus in the last week of June to finish end-of-semester academic work. The varsity, however, added that the schedule was subject to change as per Covid-19 developments and related guidance from government and University Grants Commission (UGC).“Tentatively, students are expected to return to JNU campus between June 25 and June 30 so that they can complete their remaining academic components and complete their examinations. Examinations will be completed by July 31. The next semester for the continuing students will start from August 1,” said vice-chancellor (V-C) M Jagadesh Kumar. The deadline for submission of thesis and dissertation for research scholars has also been extended to December 31.In April, the university had allowed all its schools and special centres to hold midterm and semester examination via the mode of their choice. Of the 13 schools, five decided to go for the online mode. The rest will hold offline exams after the lockdown.On Saturday, Kumar said if the examination results were not ready by July 31, students could opt to register provisionally and begin the next semester. The registration process for the next semester will be carried out online, he said.On the modalities of accommodating students on campus, Kumar told HT, “Our Covid-19 task force is working on this keeping in view the government guidelines and the UGC guidelines. We are focussed on the fact that when the students return to the university, their safety and health conditions are taken care of. We need to work out some innovative ways to make sure that they continue to study while following COVID-19 guidelines.”JNU students’ union president Aishe Ghosh, however, questioned the feasibility of conducting exams, especially for those students who did not have access to internet. “So many research scholars who left the Capital don’t even have the money to come back. Many don’t have access to internet. Without any class, students who didn’t have internet till June 25, how will they give exams without preparation? Through this mode, the onus of the results will be put on students. Nobody will notice that there was no learning in the past four months.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/jnu-revises-academic-calendar-allows-students-to-return-to-campus-in-june/story-MBNRC5kbPmIrXWhCzniWZN.html

After being shut from May 5-8 for sanitisation, the market reopened on Friday midnight. The entry of people per hour was limited, a separate area was dedicated for green vegetables, and the wearing of gloves was made compulsory. The timings were also extended by a couple of hours to ensure thinner crowds.As per the revised timings, the mandi will open from midnight till 6am and only 100 people per hour would be allowed entry into the market. Green vegetables would be sold 200 metres from the market, at the open ground of DAV school, said officials. Not more than 200 vendors at the market will be allowed to carry out unloading and loading of fruits and vegetables, while not more than 100 vendors would be allowed to do the same for green vegetables at the dedicated area, said officials.In addition, people, including vendors, below the age of 18 and above the age of 60 are not allowed entry into the market.The district administration, late Friday, had included Khandsa Road as one of the 21 containment zones in the city.“We understand the importance Khandsa Mandi holds for the city and hence, its operations will continue under essential services. We only approved its reopening after the entire market was sanitised and disinfected, and we confirmed there were no other cases linked to the market. We are closely analysing all activities across the city to limit the spread of coronavirus,” said Amit Khatri, deputy commissioner.Haryana State Agricultural Marketing Board (HSAMB) officials said that they are yet to receive any directions from the district administration regarding changes in the containment zone.“Even after cases of coronavirus were found in wholesale markets such as Azadpur Mandi in Delhi, and few mandis in Faridabad, local authorities have resumed operations there, after a brief shutdown. Hence, we are expecting Khandsa Mandi to also remain operational as it caters to a significant amount of the population and is a lifeline for the city,” said an HSAMB official privy to the matter.The mandi provides around 6,000 quintals of vegetables and fruits on a daily basis to the city.Vinay Yadav, secretary, HSAMB declined to comment on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/khandsa-market-to-continue-operations-in-sealed-area-guidelines-issued/story-IxMe5Y53HDPFMZBJ4b2ZOM.html

The power went off around 4pm on Friday, and was only restored around 7:30 pm Saturday evening.The 11kv cable connects the society with the DHBVN’s power house in Sector 9. It was laid underground more than four years ago by the DHBVN (Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam) to provide electricity to residents in NBCC Green View.Residents at the society, which is home to more than 200 families, were dependent on diesel generators (DGs) for power back up in the absence of regular electricity supply.Yadvendra Singh, a resident, said, “Our maintenance agency, appointed by the NBCC India Limited — which developed this society about four years ago – told us that a cable burst near Basai Chowk and the power distributor DHBVN has been informed about the fault.”Officials said a cable burst near Basai Chowk where the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority is constructing a flyover. The cable was fixed at the spot on Friday night, but despite fixing it the power supply could not be restored till Saturday evening .The repair work was underway till Saturday evening. RB Yadav, in-charge of the maintenance of the society, said, “We had also hired a private electrician to locate the fault in the underground cable. We detected one fault in the cable on Friday night near Basai Chowk, but it did not help in restoring the supply as there were some other faults that we tried to fix with the help of DHBVN.”CS Jakhar, DHBVN executive engineer, said, “It is a 4-km long underground cable, and it was difficult to locate all faults manually. But we procured a device that locates the faults in cables repaired the cable completely on Saturday evening.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/fault-in-power-cable-leaves-nbcc-green-view-in-the-dark-for-more-than-24-hours/story-usg4m6XcZch7yWvZIIbUJM.html
09-05-2020||Gurugram||Residents moving out of city in private vehicles seek clarity about health clearance||Confusion prevailed among the city residents regarding their travel to their home states in their personal vehicles. Residents expressed confusion as whether they are required to obtain a medical certificate on their own or would the district administration carry out the necessary health screening.The outbound applicants said that they have registered themselves on the e-Disha portal launched by the Haryana government for the movement of migrants and have received an SMS, asking them to upload a medical certificate.Umang Arora, a software professional and a resident of the city since last year, wants to leave for Meerut in Uttar Pradesh as his elderly parents live there alone, and need help in buying food, getting medicine, and performing other chores. “I had applied twice on the Saral Haryana portal but my application got rejected. On May 6, I again applied on the new e-disha webpage, and on Friday, I got a message, stating that I have to upload my medical certificate, which surprised me,” said Arora, adding that there was little clarity in this regard as to who would conduct the medical test, when and where. The applicants said that private doctors were not available in their clinics and hospitals were also reluctant to entertain asymptomatic patients. “Most of the people I know are also scared to visit hospitals or doctors as we don’t know if adequate safeguards have been taken or not. The government should conduct the screening,” said Arora.Some of the applicants, who want to move to other states in their vehicles, posted about their confusion on Twitter, and said that they should be called to a government hospital for screening instead of them having to find a doctor willing to issue a health certificate.Rajesh Kumar, a resident of Chakkarpur, who hails from Mainpuri in Uttar Pradesh and works in a hotel here, said that at the time of registering with the government, there was no mention of a medical certificate and that he expected the local authorities to carry out the screening as is the case with migrant workers. “I have to take medicines for my mother who is a heart patient and I have been waiting for the last few days to leave,” said Kumar. They also suggested that the government should charge them for a health check up and provide the certificate, thereby making the process smoother. “Why should we be required to go to a private hospital?” asked Kumar. TL Satyaprakash, secretary, home department, Haryana, who is also the nodal officer for migrants for Haryana and Karnataka, however, confirmed that migrants travelling in their vehicles would have to get a health certificate from any registered medical practitioner and submit it to the authorities. “All efforts are being made to facilitate the movement of migrants who want to leave and those who are returning. As soon as all documents are uploaded permission will be given,” he said. Suneeta Rathi, deputy CMO, Gurugram, who is responsible for health screening of migrants in the district, did not respond to repeated calls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/residents-moving-out-of-city-in-private-vehicles-seek-clarity-about-health-clearance/story-GoeDM1Lvt7RqfmyKKK8kLN.html
09-05-2020||Mumbai||BMC to add over 3,500 beds to existing capacity for Covid-positive patients||With a spike in the number of Covid-19 cases in the city this week, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has decided to add over 3,500 beds to the existing capacity for the treatment of positive patients by May 20. These will include 465 ICU beds.Recently, the civic body projected that the number of cases in the city could rise to 70,000 by May end. Currently, around 80 to 90% of patients are asymptomatic and don’t need hospitalisation. Going by this trend, about 7,000 people of the projected 70,000 are likely to need hospital beds. Hence, BMC has decided to increase its bed capacity in a phase-wise manner.As per the civic health department, as part of the first phase, 478 beds are fully commissioned including eight dialysis units which give dialysis to 25-30 patients daily in BYL Nair Hospital. In the second phase, 465 more beds to be commissioned by 14 May. Once both phases commissioned, Nair hospital will have 943 total beds including 100 intensive care units (ICUs) and neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). In addition to that, 1,306 more beds with 80 ICU units will be added in Seven Hills Hospital by May 20.“Maybe cases are increasing in some areas, so we’re increasing the number of hospital beds,” Daksha Shah, deputy executive health officer of the BMC, said.“Considering the urgency of pregnant women, we have decided to keep aside 65 dedicated beds at Nair hospital to provide proper care to pregnant women,’’said Shah.The BMC will increase 353 beds in King Edward Memorial Hospital (KEM), 260 beds in Sion Hospital, 320 in Cooper Hospital, 250 in Hindu Hruday Samrat Balasaheb Thackeray (HBT) Trauma hospital and 135 beds in Shatabdi hospital in Kandivli.Currently, Mumbai has 2,000 beds each across 26 private, municipal and state government hospitals in the city. The BMC will now increase its existing bed capacity by converting non-Covid beds into Covid beds. Anticipating the future trajectory of coronavirus, the civic body has kept 25,000 isolation beds ready for asymptomatic patients at hotels, lodges, sports complexes and at marriage halls. The BMC has identified more than 350 municipal schools to create additional capacity of 35,000 beds. The civic body has also identified halls and gymkhanas which can accommodate 20,000 beds and put it on standby.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-to-add-over-3-500-beds-to-existing-capacity-for-covid-positive-patients/story-NcBKfb05r0kXfIyEtzchiP.html

They wanted to reach Delhi where their relatives were waiting for them to board a truck to reach Bihar,” he said.According to the police, personnel at Palam Vihar border noticed some people’s movement in a truck laden with vegetables. They checked under the tarpaulin and found nearly 15 migrant labourers.When questioned, the labourers told the police that they feared getting placed under quarantine so they planned to escape from the city.“Those caught told the police that some fellow labourers were walking down and some had boarded different vehicles. All were found and sent to rescue shelters after their medical examination was conducted,” said Akil.Aman Yadav, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said Uttarakhand government has organised 42 buses to bring back the migrant labourers from Gurugram. These buses are being operated from Tau Devi Lal stadium each night, the ACP said. “Many labourers from Delhi are also trying to enter the city and misguide the administration. Even if they do not hail from Uttarakhand, they try hard to board the bus saying that they have lost their identification (ID) cards. But we are only allowing those who are registered and are carrying valid ID cards,” Yadav said.The police commissioner said, “We have initiated strict checking at all the borders connecting to the national capital and other districts. Besides, around 200 cops are deployed near Tau Devi Lal stadium to ensure no one enters the stadium who does not have valid documents to travel.”Some migrants have managed to cross the border. Mukesh Kumar of Madhya Pradesh said it’s been three days since he left Delhi. “I managed to enter Gurugram along with 16 others. We were not left with any option. My relatives were stranded in Gurugram, so I thought to join them and start journey together,” he said.The officials said the district administration is making all arrangements for their travel and has already started the process, as per Covid-19 guidelines of the Union ministry of home affairs (MHA).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/security-beefed-up-on-delhi-borders-to-check-movement-of-migrant-labourers/story-ELKkyfw3YBvfcSKnvLlyyM.html

09-05-2020||Mumbai||Ensure Covid-19 does not spread any further in jails: HC to Maharashtra jail authorities||Observing that the situation in Arthur Road jail, where 77 inmates and 26 staff members have tested positive for Covid-19, the Bombay high court on Friday asked the jail authorities to ensure that the virus does not spread any further.Justice Bharati Dangre said that the authorities need not be reminded of the rights of inmates to a safe and healthy environment, and even while incarceration they equally enjoy the right to life as those in the outside world.The judge was hearing a plea filed by an inmate of Arthur Road jail, Ali Akbar Shroff, seeking interim bail on the ground that in light of the precarious situation on account of the spread of Covid-19 in Arthur Road jail he had become more vulnerable.His counsel, senior advocate Abad Ponda, pointed out that the 43-year-old is a chronic patient of diabetes, hypertension and high blood pressure. Ponda added that Shroff also has a sinus problem and required constant medical treatment and supervision.This medical condition, according to the senior advocate, may prove fatal as persons suffering from hypertension and diabetes are considered more susceptible to the coronavirus and therefore urged the court to release Shroff on temporary bail.“The situation no doubt is precarious,” said justice Dangre commenting on Linda’s statement that several inmates of Arthur Road jail have tested positive for coronavirus. “If it is true that more than 100 patients have been tested positive in Arthur Road jail, it is for the authorities to arrange for their affairs and to ensure that the inmates presently housed in the jail are not infected by the virus,” the judge added.She, however, rejected the interim bail plea saying several aged inmates are presently languishing in jail although they are more prone to the virus, as compared to the present applicant. “Since no imminent health impediment is reflected in the case of the present applicant, the application is rejected.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ensure-covid-19-does-not-spread-any-further-in-jails-hc-to-maharashtra-jail-authorities/story-1moGsoEQB98CzyAhqGeV4I.html
09-05-2020||Mumbai||St George hospital starts dialysis facility for Covid-19 patients||The government-run St George Hospital has started a dialysis facility for Covid-19 patients.The Covid-19 converted hospital mostly receives critically-ill patients infected with the novel coronavirus - many with a history of acute kidney ailments and require dialysis every day. Doctors, as a result, referred them to other centres owing to the unavailability of the dialysis facility, which often delayed their treatment.Taking note of it, the hospital has procured five dialysis machines and additional 10 will soon be acquired.“One machine can conduct dialysis of six to eight patients daily. With our capacity, 30-40 patients can undergo dialysis every day,” said Dr Akash Khobragade, superintendent of the hospital. “We are in the process of getting more machines so that critical patients don’t have to run around.”HT has been reporting on the difficulties faced by Covid-19 infected dialysis patients due to lack of facilities. At present, the dialysis facility for Covid-19 patients is available in Seven Hills, Kasturba Gandhi, King Edward Memorial, Nanavati and Saifee hospitals.Dialysis is the process of removing excess water, solutes, and toxins from the blood in people whose kidneys can no longer perform these functions naturally. This is referred to as renal replacement therapy. Every alternate day, patients need to undergo dialysis, without this, a chronic kidney failure patient can even die.“A patient on dialysis already have compromised health immunity which makes them more susceptible to Covid-19 infection. In such a situation, if dialysis is not provided on time, the chances of mortality among such patients is high,” said Sejal Jobanputra, a coordinator of Kidney Warriors Foundation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/st-george-hospital-starts-dialysis-facility-for-covid-19-patients/story-F2g2dBypqOOBE45JRuqmPK.html
09-05-2020||Delhi||Couple arrested for series of snatching incidents||The Delhi Police on Saturday arrested a 22-year-old man and a 20-year-old woman for allegedly committing a series of snatchings in the national capital in the last three months.The police said the two suspects were addicted to drugs and would snatch mobile phones from people before selling them to buy narcotics.The police identified the suspects as Arjun alias Chhanga, who is from Paharganj, and Vaishali Kaushal, who is a tattoo artist. They had first met in December at Kaushal’s tatto studio in Karolbagh where Arjun, who has several criminal cases against his name, had come to get inked, the police said. They added that the two suspects soon realised they had a lot in common, and moved in together three months later.After moving in together, the couple began snatching mobile phones for money they needed to buy drugs, the police said. However, the nationwide lockdown had forced them to stop their criminal activities, they added.The couple allegedly resumed snatchings last week, soon after the government eased the lockdown norms allowing people to step out of their homes and open standalone shops and run offices with one-third staff members. Deputy commissioner of police (central) Sanjay Bhatia, said within a week, the couple targeted six pedestrians, in central, north and west Delhi. They used to ride a scooter and snatch mobile phones and bags of their victims, he said. However, the couple ran out of luck on Saturday, when a team from the Desh Bandhu Gupta (DBG) Road police station intercepted them near Kishanganj railway colony near north Delhi’s Sarai Rohilla. The two suspects had gone there to allegedly sell the stolen phones. The couple had already committed two snatchings in Khyala and Subzi Mandi in less than three hours, before being caught around noon, said a police officer involved in the operation.“ We seized four stolen mobile phones and a stolen scooter from the couple. Arjun, who was previously involved in over 31 crimes, used to ride the scooter, while Vaishali rode pillion and snatched mobile phones from pedestrians,” said DCP Bhatia.The police officer added that several teams were formed to nab the suspects after snatchings were reported from central Delhi areas. Statements of a few victims of snatchings and the footage from CCTV cameras installed around the crime scenes had pointed towards the involvement of a couple riding a white scooter in the snatchings.“Our teams activated the criminal intelligence network that helped them zero in on the young couple living in Paharganj area. The couple’s movements were tracked and they were caught from Kishanganj railway colony,” a police officer said.The officer said that the couple used to live on rent in a room in Shalimar Bagh area in northwest Delhi, where they used to keep the stolen property. The couple told the police that they had committed more than a dozen snatchings before the lockdown was announced on March 24. They used to sell the stolen phones to a shopkeeper in Karol Bagh.“We have identified the man who used to buy the stolen property. He will be arrested soon,” the officer added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/couple-arrested-for-series-of-snatching-incidents/story-MHMX6vstteISmoGBVzLdAI.html
09-05-2020||City||Delhi: HC extends bail of under-trials prisoners by 45 days over corona infection fears||New Delhi The Delhi High Court on Saturday extended the interim bail of 2,177 under trial prisoners for another 45 days after the high-powered committee, constituted to decongest Tihar jail, made the recommendation.In April, the under-trials, lodged across three prisons in Delhi -- Tihar, Mandoli, and Rohini -- were released on interim bail to decongest the jail complexes and ensure social distancing inside prisons. At over 18,000 prisoners, Tihar is the most crowded prison in the country. Prison officers are on high alert ever since reports came of prisoners testing positive for the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease in other prison complexes in the country. At Tihar however, no prisoner had tested positive for the virus until Saturday.A bench of Justice Siddharth Mridul and Justice Talwant Singh on Saturday afternoon extended the period of interim bail by 45 days from the date of the respective expiry of the interim bails, on the continuation of the terms and conditions. The court told Sandeep Goel, director general (prisons) to ensure this order is conveyed to all the 2,177 under-trials by telephone, as well as through all other available modes of communication.The court’s order comes in reference to a matter filed on the basis of a letter written by the Delhi State Legal Services Authority (DSLSA), seeking a judicial order to extend the interim bails.On May 5, a meeting of the high-powered committee, headed by Justice Hima Kohli of the Delhi High Court, was convened, where the DG (prisons) had said that the interim bails of the 2,177 prisoners was going to end on May 9.Kanwaljeet Arora, member secretary, DSLSA, had said that since it would be difficult to file separate pleas for all the inmates, a judicial order by the high court would suffice. The committee had then asked the DSLSA to put this forth before the Registrar General of the Delhi High Court, following which the matter was taken up on Saturday.On Saturday, in a hearing held via video conferencing, Goel told the court that health concerns with regards to the Sars-Cov-2 pandemic have not changed and that it would be a dangerous proposition if the undertrials out on bail are put back into jails, where they might infect other prisoners.Advocate Rahul Mehra, standing counsel (criminal), and advocate Chaitnaya, both representing the Delhi government, submitted there is no objection to the extension of the interim bails granted to the 2,177 under-trials by another period of 45 days from the respective date of expiry of their interim bail period.Following this, the court accepted the recommendations of the committee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-hc-extends-bail-of-under-trials-prisoners-by-45-days-over-corona-infection-fears/story-6k5e5QUaCItHsWeoYqrNNO.html

The woman’s mother had died battling cancer three days ago at the hospital.Police suspect that the woman may have allegedly killed herself by jumping from the third floor of a building adjacent to the terrace, where her body was found.The woman, investigators said, was missing from the hospital soon after her mother passed away at AIIMS during treatment and her father was out to complete the formalities to claim the body. The family had filed a missing persons complaint, said deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Kumar Thakur.According to the police, the woman’s mother was brought to AIIMS on April 30. The doctors tried their best to cure her but the cancer was in the advanced category. The patient’s daughter had been upset because her mother’s health had been deteriorating, an officer said.On May 6, the patient died and her husband went to complete the hospital formalities. Their daughter, in the meanwhile, left her cellphone in the ward where the patient was being treated and stepped out. The father returned and found his daughter missing.

On Saturday morning, the hospital staff found her body on the terrace with head injuries.“We spoke to her friends and relatives.

09-05-2020||City||Bihar, Delhi ministers lock horns over credit for migrants’ return||PATNAA day after the Delhi government claimed to have paid the train travel of 1,200 migrant workers to Muzaffarpur district, Bihar’s minister Sanjay Jha Saturday slammed the Arvind Kejriwal-led AAP government for politicking over the matter saying they had already shot off a letter to Bihar government seeking immediate reimbursement of the amount involved.Reacting to a tweet by Delhi minister Gopal Rai, Jha said it was resorting to “white lies” over the return of hapless labourers stranded in national capital due to the nationwide lockdown.“I saw a tweet by a Delhi minister saying they are paying for the tickets of 1,200 migrants who are travelling from Delhi to Muzaffarpur (but) I have a letter here sent by their government asking for the reimbursement of the money from the Bihar government,” the minister for water resources said.As soon as the Shramik Special train left for Muzaffarpur on Friday, AAP’s Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Singh was quick to take credit for facilitating their return back home, while implying that Bihar government had failed to come to the aid of its workers. Jha also released copy of the letter and said, “On one hand you are taking credit, saying you are sending them back with your own money. On the other hand, you are requesting not to reimburse passengers but to reimburse the amount to the Delhi government.”“What kind of optics are you trying to create. See your minister Gopal Rai is lying on Twitter that your government will pay the fare, then (you) send a letter asking for money from us,” Jha tweeted.Union minister Giriraj Singh also attacked the Delhi government for taking recourse to “cheap publicity”.Later, Delhi’s health minister Satyendra Jain stepped in. “It is not fair to take money from them (migrant labourers), they have been staying in shelter homes for last two months. From where will they get money to pay for tickets, so the Delhi government paid for it. One shouldn’t do politics over it.”Earlier, the Bihar government had announced that the travel fare from originating station would be reimbursed by it after the completion of the mandatory 21-day quarantine, besides an additional sum of Rs 500 each. Railways is bearing 85% of the ticket fare, while the state governments concerned will have to pay the remaining 15%, as per Union health ministry.Meanwhile, another special train left Delhi for Muzaffarpur on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bihar-delhi-ministers-lock-horns-over-credit-for-migrants-return/story-kOYY6ncWaK1Nh3vX3YFaUM.html

We are sorry for the insensitivity shown by the Bihar government. As a responsible opposition we offer our support in terms of financial contribution in taking back migrant Bihari workforce, Please let us know the modalities of transferring the money,”(sic) Tejashwi posted in a tweet, taking potshots at the state government’s reported stand that no reimbursement would be made to the Delhi government against ticket fare of the migrants.The Bihar government and Delhi government has come to loggerheads over the ticket fare payment of the migrant labourers who returned by the special train to Muzaffarpur from Delhi. While Delhi government claimed it had made advance payment as ticket fare for the special train and sought reimbursement, the state government has asserted that the reimbursement on the same would be done at the quarantine centres on their return as per the MHA guidelines.“Our party is ready to pay the ticket fare of passengers for 50 trains . We stand by words. The Bihar government should also make public how it will reimburse the train fare cost to Delhi government,” Tejashwi said.However, Tejashwi said that the latest episode of friction between Bihar and Delhi government has only exposed how the Nitish Kumar dispensation is not sympathetic towards the plight of lakhs of migrants stranded in various states and requesting for special trains at the bare minimum is a formality.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/ready-to-pay-for-50-trains-tejashwi-slams-nitish-over-ticket-fare-row/story-mHwKI9nYPjgPEyZU6c23II.html

The state government, in reply to the letter written by Delhi government’s nodal officer on May 7, asking for reimbursement, said the request was a clear violation of guidelines issued by the Ministry of Railways.The reply, issued by Pratyaya Amrit, principal secretary (disaster management department), Bihar, cited the clause 11 (c) of guidelines issued by Ministry of Railways (vide no. DTP/2020/05/17 dated 2nd May, 2020) which says, “The local state government authority shall hand over the tickets to the passengers cleared by them and collect the ticket fare and handover the total amount to railways.”“In consonance with this policy, we shall reimburse the fare to the Railway, and not to the Delhi government,” the letter says.The Delhi government’s letter had sought reimbursement of Rs 6.5 lakh.As per guidelines of the central government, either the destination state or the origin state of the train concerned has to bear 15% of the ticket cost while the remaining 85% will be taken care of by the Centre. The tickets are to be charged by the railways at sleeper class rates plus an additional Rs 50.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-bihar-govts-clash-over-train-bill/story-UAdy1NVcbcN7oo16p33dAM.html

Investigating officials said, the deceased—Madan Lal, a resident of Dhanas, allegedly had a huge quarrel with his family on Friday night. His family said he had locked himself up in his room and on the next day took the extreme step.

His body was discovered around 10 am.Dhanas is a village panchayat and home to several densely populated colonies of migrants.Nearly four hours later, a second suicide was reported from Aman Colony in Dhanas. Police said, the deceased—35-year-old Birbal—worked for a private company in Mohali and since the lockdown, he was alone at home. The police did not find any suicide note from the house.The third suicide case was reported late on Friday night, when 22-year-old Neelam, resident of EWS colony, allegedly jumped off the fourth floor of her house, after a dispute with her brother. Police said that the brother would get drunk regularly, and that night Neelam was persuading her brother not to drink so much. However, what began as a small argument led to a bitter quarrel and in the heat of the moment she jumped off the building. The police said the family is in a state of shock. Kachi colony in Dhanas also falls under the containment zone and so far, two positive Covid cases have been reported from the area. However, senior superintendent of police (SSP) Nilambari Jagadale said, “The three suicides were committed due to ongoing family disputes.

09-05-2020||Chandigarh||Aurangabad incident reflects economic inequality in India, says BJP leader Shanta Kumar||Expressing grief over the death of 16 migrant workers from Madhya Pradesh in a train accident in Maharashtra’s Aurangabad district, senior BJP leader and former Union minister Shanta Kumar said that the incident reflects the chinks in India’s economy, also dubbed as a fastest growing nation in the world.In a press statement issued here on Saturday, the 85-year-old said that impatience of people returning home on foot has opened the eyes of the entire nation.He said that labourers tired after walking 40km distance on foot were sleeping on the rail track and were crushed on death by a train in Aurangabad.He said that before Covid-19 it was being claimed that India is the fastest-growing economy in the world and figures among the top five richest countries and crores of people have been brought out of poverty but now coronavirus pandemic has brought out the truth.The former two-term chief minister of Himachal Pradesh said that though the Modi government launched various schemes for the welfare of the poor the system that is responsible for implementation is dishonest and inefficient.“Implementation of those schemes was not proper. The statistics that are presented as our success are damned lies,” he alleged adding that development happened but it did not help the poor.“The benefit did not reach the targeted population and inequality increased so exponentially that India today is the country with highest economic disparity,” he said.He said that India’s population increases by approximately 1.60 crores every year; an army of 1 crore unemployed are added. India is at the top of the hunger index and the number of deaths due to malnutrition.“The ever-increasing population will never let poverty elimination become a reality in our country and tough laws are needed to be implemented. Otherwise, Aurangabad like incident will be just the normal,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/aurangabad-incident-reflects-economic-inequality-in-india-says-bjp-leader-shanta-kumar/story-aoRZV3ned2lzvQQG7NO0AP.html

09-05-2020||Chandigarh||Residents take offence to quarantine facilities in their areas||With Chandigarh administration extending quarantine facilities to hotels and schools to deal with mounting cases, residents living close to these facilities are protesting the move. They allege that by setting up isolation facilities in densely populated parts of the sectors, the administration is exposing them to danger. Residents of Sectors 10 and 46 have written to the UT administration to mark their protest.Recently, the UT administration opted for Hotel Mountview to quarantine patients, while milder and asymptomatic cases will be sent to the Sector-46 Dhanwantari Ayurvedic Hospital. The move has prompted residents of both sectors to point out to the administration that the places are uncomfortably close to residential areas, thus a source of threat to them.Hotel Mountview, in Sector 10, is situated in the midst of a residential area. Protesting this, president of the resident welfare association (RWA), Col Kulwinder Singh (retd), has written to UT administration asking them opt for some other hotel for quarantine. “Mountview is in the heart of the sector with houses of senior citizens all around it. The government only wants to make money for CITCO by charging exorbitant rates. What about the safety of residents?” he asked.Singh has asked UT adviser Manoj Parida to opt for another hotel or face retaliation from citizens. “We residents will form a chain around Mount View and stop their buses from entering if needed,” he said.The local area councillor here, Maheshinder Singh Sidhu, said that rather than bring people to a centrally situated hotel, such as The Mountview, the administration could consider using hotels situated in Sector 17, or the Industrial area, or even the outskirts of the city for the safety of residents.Residents of Sector 46 also claim a similar problem with Dhanwantari Ayurvedic Hospital in the sector, being chosen as quarantine facility. Situated right next to the busy Sector 46 market and the residential area, the move has not gone down well with residents. President of Sector 46-D RWA, Kedarnath Sharma, said, “The hospital is situated adjacent to a temple and a school. A 24/7 supervision may not be possible. Patients may even roam around as they are mostly asymptomatic which is a cause of worry to residents.” He also said that a quarantine facility had been set up at Government Model Senior Secondary School in Sector 46-D on Saturday which provoked a sense of panic. He said he had written to administration officials about the unsuitability of both places.The local area councillor here, Gurpreet Singh, said, “The city doesn’t have many hospitals, and I agreed with the administration after being assured that all precautions would be taken. I had even recorded a video for residents to pacify them. However, making a Covid quarantine in Sector 46-D government school is a bad idea as it is a crowded area. I have reached out to the deputy commissioner (DC) and the local MP as well, asking them to reconsider and opt for a building on the outskirts of the sector or another sector for this.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/residents-take-offence-to-quarantine-facilities-in-their-areas/story-nt1Djllm0DRkvY7dE7aP9O.html
09-05-2020||City||Mum’s the word on Lockdown’s Mother’s Day||Trips to trot the globe – Guatemala to Gulmarg – are now history of the #OldNormal. So, which trips are the #NewNormal? Guilt trips, of course!In #lockdown’s zero travel, many a compulsive traveller is doing the next best thing – laying the guilt trip. Safest on the pulmonary socket, lightest on the pocket.What we’re witnessing is a new breed of “business” travellers – those making it their business to take you on a guilt trip, to kill time in #quarantine. India Quarantining could thus be in the throes of three types of guilt trips.OF PLANET WA & PANDEMICSWhy look far – not that India Quarantining can goggle farther than the laundry or lolling legs on neighbouring terraces or, for the luckier lawn-lounging ones, farther than the shrubbery or snobbery of their sprawling greens – Yours Truly was propelled on a guilt trip just the other day.Now, in a New Normal where the virtual is the only place for clubbing, pubbing or social shoulder rubbing, any netizen not navigating the social media mindlessly, WhatsApp (WA) in particular, is thought out of his or her mind.Now, certain Tweeple who’re good with the “mind” – how to mind other’s business better than their own – took it upon themselves to chide Yours Truly for no longer populating Planet WhatsApp. To put things in perspective, it may be recalled, dear readers, that one fine day upon finding my membership of WA group chats outnumbering my membership of clubs or credit cards, Yours Truly downsized – to Zero WA.Lo Behold, Biradri, BFFs & Co unlocked their guilt trip, left right and epicentre. “How on Earth can you survive Lockdown if you’re not on WA?” This compelled Yours Truly to apply the mind in a manner smacking of pondering profundity that can come only from having to don the “thinking cap” at a time when pyjamas, not caps, are New Normal’s National Dress and when the only caps consuming contemplative activity are Closedown’s “caps” on incomes, expenditures etc. Rolling my eyes heavenwards, not that in quarantine there were substantial spectators to savour my pupillary histrionics, save scoffing Brats and a couple of cats, I resorted to my sole serious exercise in ages – jogging my rusting grey cells for a repartee. Bingo, the way out-of-the world wisecracks are wont to hit Donald Trump like a truant tonne of a truck tearing into Lockdown’s barricades, Enlightenment embraced me, in utter violation of social distancing protocol.“Hey, well I’m surviving without WhatsApp the way William (Shakespeare) and Isaac (Newton) survived the plague ... Or the way, without WA, Walt Disney and Mahatma Gandhi survived the Spanish Flu!”Disclaimer – Evacuating from Planet WA in pandemics can be hilarious to health.OF #WFH MUMS & (S)MOTHERINGThe Mother of Guilt Trips may be of the parenting kind. For many a man or woman of the house who’ve earlier been at the receiving end of guilt trips for non-availability of quality-time parenting, #WorkFromHome seems a blessing in disguise. Ah, except where it’s seeing New Normal’s New “Business” Travel take off – Reverse Guilt Trips.Lockdown’s first Mother’s Day might find many a #wfh mum, who’s working overtime on her (s)mothering too, inviting free tickets for “business” guilt trips from piqued progeny, “Mind your business, mum… Gimme space!”Seeing the scarcity of ‘space’ for Middle Class Quarantining India, packed onto Planet Puny Living Room 24x7, this politely translates into a reverse guilt trip with a not-so-exotic destination – “Go to Hell!”Disclaimer – New Normal’s guilt trips are injurious to mommyhood’s health.OF QUARANTINE’S CALL OF THE HOURJust when you’re falling in love with Lockdown’s long silence – no pesky phone calls or constant trilling of the doorbell as noisy as Arnab & Co’s lubricated lungs – there come “calling” ‘n’ caterwauling Tweeple whose idea of social distancing doesn’t constitute telephonic distancing. Voila, you land in the throes of the third guilt trip – contacts you haven’t heard from since the Tsunami or their Great Depression (emotional not economic), call out of the blue to drive away their blues. “Why haven’t you called in ages?” calls Guilt Trip Three, as you mumble or fumble for retorts to the effect that but for Lockdown, they’d not have called in this century. It’s like a bored Trump, thirsting for a tête-à-tête, dialling for a chummy “hi-bye” not just the Queen but even the Chinese Premier.Disclaimer – Call of the Guilt Trips can be contagious to bye-lateral health!||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mum-s-the-word-on-lockdown-s-mother-s-day/story-kmUiXjfjEpmyQZI8I8ffzK.html

He said that sanitiser scam of the state secretariat is also a matter of concern.“The state government is receiving liberal donations but still, neither doctors nor the administrative officials have been provided PPE kits,” he said.He said that the lack of coordination among different departments during the cremation of coronavirus positive youth from Sarkaghat also exposed the poor preparedness of the state government.The Congress leader said that the government should also clear its position with regard to quarantine and isolation centres as these are being opened within the populated areas.Speaking on the isolation centre in Baijnath which was set up in the densely populated area, he suggested that the state government should consider setting up paid quarantine centres because there are many people who want to return from outside and are ready to pay for the quarantine facility.“The government should talk to hotel and guest house owners to convert their properties into paid quarantine centres,” said Sharma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hp-govt-s-wrong-decision-can-prove-harmful-to-people-cong-leader/story-auKoF4aTbMwgaLXwaC9QlM.html

Moreover, the intensive care unit (ICU) and the isolation ward at the hospital are also shut for two days for disinfection. Patients are being admitted only in the general ward. On May 8, two resident doctors, aged 32 and 27, tested positive along with a 23-year-old woman intern. All of them had come in contact with the head of the medicine department and another 36-year-old intern, who had earlier tested positive at the hospital. Dr. Pratibha Sawant, the newly-appointed dean of the hospital, said, “Two resident doctors tested positive on May 8 along with one intern. One of the doctors was from the medicine department and other was from the chest department. Resident doctors refused to work and demanded quarantine, as they had worked with the infected doctors. All nine residents were quarantined and their swab samples were collected.”A senior doctor from the hospital informed, “The ICU and isolation wards will be disinfected on Saturday and Sunday and no patient will be admitted to these wards. We will admit patients only in the general ward, unless it is an emergency, for which some arrangement can be made. Nine resident doctors are quarantined, while seven senior doctors have gone on sick leave making it difficult to manage the hospital.”A resident doctor requesting anonymity said, “We had a meeting with the seniors, they were ready to quarantine us, however, they will put us in quarantine centres with other people and no separate provisions will be made.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/services-affected-at-thane-hospital-after-nine-resident-docs-quarantined-seven-seniors-take-sick-leave/story-efuyuAx4gF3paMtkxQKgIM.html
09-05-2020||City||Tricity buzz: HT Chandigarh reporters’ tracker on all those making, or faking, news amid coronavirus lockdown||COVID-19 PANDEMIC KEEPING MOHALI BUREAUCRATS ON THEIR TOESMohali deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan and additional deputy commissioner Aashika Jain have been rushing from one site to another, overseeing arrangements made for the return of migrant workers to their native places. Even before the Shramik Special trains started, people from Uttarakhand, who were stranded in Punjab, were sent home in buses. The DC ensured the operation went off smoothly by camping at the site. He was at the railway station when the first train with migrant labourers left for Hardoi in Uttar Pradesh last week. From making announcements to asking people to maintain social distancing, the officials are busy doing their bit to battle Covid-19.UT CHEERS ON GETTING PAT FOR 100% FREE RATION DISTRIBUTIONUT officials were all smiles after Union minister of consumer affairs, food and public distribution Ram Vilas Paswan tweeted that the Chandigarh Administration has distributed 100% free ration for April to 2.75 lakh beneficiaries under the Pradhan Mantri Grameen Kalyan Yojana. A senior UT police official retweeted, saying, “Great initiative by hon’ble PM and meticulously implemented in Chandigarh”. LOOKING FOR BREATHER, DGP PEDALS ACROSS TOWN WITH SONWith the surge in Covid-19 cases in Chandigarh, the police are beginning to feel the pressure and the soaring mercury has only added to their woes. The force, including director general of police (DGP) Sanjay Baniwal, are looking for a breather from their routine. In a recent tweet Baniwal said that happiness is exploring City Beautiful on bicycle with my son. “A much deserved short break from the regimental police routine.” Baniwal surely is making the most of the good and clean air that the city residents are breathing thanks to the lockdown.WHEN MOHALI POLICE WENT INCOMMUNICADOAfter the registration of a case against former Punjab DGP Sumedh Singh Saini at Mataur police station of Mohali district, police officials in the district have become suddenly become inaccessible. Most police officials switched off their mobile phones, while a few who answered the call, refused to comment. “Out of syllabus,” was the reply of the station house officer (SHO) posted in Kharar sub division when asked about the case. LONG QUEUES FOR LIQUOR A THING OF THE PASTThe first day after the sale of liquor was allowed last week saw long lines outside vends in Sectors 9, 21 and 38 of Chandigarh. Over the days, the queues have gradually disappeared and the rush in markets has decreased considerably. Shopkeepers running non-essential businesses said that only liquor vends drew most customers, while their sales have remained dismal ever since the curfew was opened up from May 3. Even liquor vend owners admit sales have come down after the first day of the rush.DOCTORS OPPOSED TO EASING LOCKDOWN CURBSThe decision to partially open the lockdown amid the rising Covid-19 cases has not gone well with a few members of the doctor’s community. Few doctors in the city are upset with the fact the Chandigarh administration has not put across a message that categorically states what prompted them to ease the restrictions and that the public should not venture out unnecessarily.RENT ORDER LEAVES UT ADMINISTRATION IN A FIXAmid the Covid-19 lockdown, the UT administration is issuing so many orders everyday that it has failed to keep a track of them. On top of that, there are fresh directions from home ministry, time and again. This time, the UT was clueless about an order regarding the payment of rent by tenants. The home ministry order of March 29 said that one month rent is not to be asked for by landlords. If this skipped the UT administration’s attention, the order’s silence on the rents for April and May is adding to the chaos. PHARMACIST’S HOLIDAY PLANS DURING QUARANTINEHoping to get some time off, a pharmacist at the Panchkula civil hospital and a resident of Zirakpur cooked up a story, telling the hospital administration that he had come in contact with an acquaintance of one of his friends who has now tested positive for Covid-19 in Uttar Pradesh. Being a suspected contact, he was tested for Covid-19 but the hospital administration was in for a surprise when the pharmacist disappeared after being tested. A complaint was put up before the hospital administration and local police. However, the next day, he surfaced and tested negative. Sources said the pharmacist was hoping to be home quarantined for 14 days, but his sudden disappearance brought out the truth.Inputs by Hillary Victor, Munieshwer A Sagar, Shailee Dogra, Shub Karman Dhaliwal, Rajanbir Singh, Amanjeet Singh, Yuvraj Kaushal and Srishti Jaswal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/tricity-buzz-ht-chandigarh-reporters-tracker-on-all-those-making-or-faking-news-amid-coronavirus-lockdown/story-ATBDV7ujVOhB1vsFqXNBRI.html
09-05-2020||City||Punjab: Vans delivering de-addiction drugs at doorstep to ensure social distancing at OOAT centres||At a time when thousands of drug addicts are visiting de-addiction centres due to shortage of narcotics supply amid the lockdown, making social distancing nearly impossible, the Kapurthala health department has launched its second outpatient opioid assisted treatment (OOAT) van to provide treatment to the addicts at their doorstep.Besides delivering de-addiction drugs and screening addicts, the van will be equipped to conduct HIV tests on the patients along with consultations by experts. The HIV test was almost stopped in the district as most people were unable to visit the district hospital amid the curfew and the cases might have witnessed a rise with addicts using the same syringes due to shortage, said a doctor.Around 2,000 persons have been enrolled themselves for treatment at nine government OOAT centres in Kapurthala district in the past 40 days. After the launch of the first OOAT van on April 14, 300 more patients have enrolled for delivery of medicines at their doorsteps.“To ensure social distancing in OOAT centres, we decided to launch another van for visits to affected areas every three days in a week,” said Dr Sandeep Bhola, nodal officer, mental health and de-addiction centres.The nodal officer added that to create more awareness about this initiative, the health department was taking help from sarpanches and NGOs to identify addicts in their surroundings and ask them to get treatment through the van in their villages.Meanwhile, there has been a spike in the number of patients at de-addiction centres across the district. The centres used to receive an average of 30 to 50 admissions per month, but now the numbers have shot up to 200 due to the non-availability of drugs. The district has now over 8,400 registered addicts at the OOAT centres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-vans-delivering-de-addiction-drugs-at-doorstep-to-ensure-social-distancing-at-ooat-centres/story-jlEUBg8i1ltWEWMqUUxU2I.html

However, there is no mention of the outsourced employees in the order. The order states hike only for contractual employees of NHM.There are total 13,500 NHM employees in Punjab and 450 of them are outsourced.Tarun Kumar, an outsourced worker and member of NHM Employees’ Union said, “The state government is not treating us fairly. We all are doing the same work as regular and contractual employees. Our ANMs and staff nurses are also fighting Covid-19. Then why has the health department left us out.”“On April 28, our union had met health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu and he had promised to hike salaries of all employees, including outsourced and contractual. The state department had also included this promise in the minutes of that meeting. However, the health department on Friday issued an order for 18% hike in salaries of only contractual NHM employees,” said Tarun.The outsourced workers have warned of protest if the state government does not give them 18% hike in salaries.NHM director Dr Parvinder Sidhu said, “We have given hike to contractual employees. We will think about the outsourced employees later.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/18-salary-hike-450-outsourced-nhm-employees-in-punjab-not-covered-under-order/story-DzBPdzlsB3HJyyTkCjoGIP.html
09-05-2020||City||Wildbuzz: Falcons face ISIS-style butchery||Disturbing videos released online by Islamic State terrorists revel in the gory decapitation of humans. Nothing less than a ‘copy and paste’ model of such barbarism has caught popular fancy among rogue pigeon fanciers of Punjab. Irked by raptors such as the Shikra, Eurasian Sparrow hawk, and the migratory Tundra Peregrine and Laggar falcons preying on their expensive pigeons, the fanciers capture raptors and make videos that are posted on TikTok and YouTube. Some of these latest videos, which draw a huge number of views, ‘likes’ and ‘shares’, show gruesome beheading of the raptors or a muscular Punjabi hand wrenching off the falcon’s head. Pigeon fanciers also shoot down falcons and make videos of that illegal act.To trap falcons, fanciers resort to a cunning method of watching the perch of a falcon high up on a mobile or electricity transmission tower. Knowing that the falcon will sit only at a particular point on the tower, the pigeon fancier lays a trap by climbing the tower or layers the falcon’s regular perch with glue. When the falcon returns to the perch, the hapless bird is trapped and the pigeon fancier climbs and retrieves the raptor for a gory slaughter video that has raunchy and hubristic Punjabi songs playing as a backdrop.From the fanciers’ blinded viewpoint, the hapless raptor that has flown thousands of miles from the Arctic tundra to winter and feed in India is nothing more than a “flying wolf among their ‘bachhas’ (pigeons)”. Raptors cannot be killed under India’s Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, and various migratory bird global treaties. I had provided evidence of raptor slaughter to the Union ministry of environment and forests and the Punjab wildlife preservation department in 2018. However, nothing seems to have changed on ground and the butchery continues unabated. A SWEET TOOTH FOR MOONLIT GULAB JAMUNS “O moon! Tell me how does it feel walking silently across the night sky alone? Are you not tired?” Can the moon ever tire of beaming its gentle smile on earth below and lighting the track for creatures of the dark? A most delightful discovery came the way of wildlife guards of the Sukhna Lake Nature Trail while on a night patrol. They focused their flashlights on a trio of Gular trees (Ficus racemosa). The upper branches came alive with scurrying creatures feasting on reddish-maroon Gular figs. On one tree there were as many as 10 Common palm civets (Bijjoo). When a flashlight is shone on a civet at night, its eyes shine like luminous pools of a full moon akin to those of a deer startled in car headlights. The abundance of civets indicated good breeding and a viable Sukhna habitat. Another good news is the birth of three Chital (Spotted deer) fawns bolstering the very tiny population of this species that dwells along the Nature Trail. Senior officers of the forests and wildlife department were delighted when the sightings were reported up the chain of command.The civet is a strange-looking creature that evokes comparison with a bear cub or a hybrid mongoose-cat. It is associated with unwarranted superstitions because it is seen so rarely during the day. Civets feed on mulberries and then Gular figs as the summer deepens. Ripening of Amaltas sweet pods after the golden showers brings a third sweetmeat in peak summer. The civets’ presence can be detected the next morning by their excreta dropped liberally under Amaltas trees. The Gular is a ‘gulab jamun’ for wild creatures. Chhatbir zookeepers collect fallen figs, knowing that deer species nurture a proverbial ‘sweet tooth’. When Gular figs are put out for Mouse deer, Barking deer, Manipur Brow-antlered deer and Hog deer, the melee would be evocative of migrant children in a Covid quarantine being distributed free chocolates!||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/wildbuzz-falcons-face-isis-style-butchery/story-C10mHOdlmUafiIbyPlRxiP.html

09-05-2020||Chandigarh||Bee-keepers in Himachal lose business amid lockdown||Peripatetic bee-keepers are bearing the brunt of the lockdown imposed to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus.The bee-keepers traditionally bring their apiaries to Himachal during the flowering season of fruit trees and migrate to the plains during winter.This year, too, the bee-keepers travelled to the hills, having acquired permission to travel during the lockdown, only to be turned away by orchardists as many believe that bees may spread the contagion.The orchardists that did entertain them, offered them a pittance for their services, say apiarists. Bees are essential for both the state’s honey industry and fruit orchards as they help increase pollination, as such many orchardists pay a nominal price to put up bees hives in their orchards during blooming season. However, this year only a few people availed bee-keepers’ services. Finding no takers, Amar Singh, an apiarist, has put up his hives along the stretch between Kaharapathar and Shirthi village. “I came to Kotkhai from Paonta Sahib with my colonies but orchard owners turned my away as they fear that the bees may spread the virus.” HONEY PRICES PLUMMETWith the lockdown in place, bee-keepers are unable to sell honey, except locally, which has led to a drop in prices.Beekeeper Rohit Negi, who moved from Ambala to Rohru, can’t help but ruefully compare the prices of honey with last year.“Last year the apiaries in Punjab and Haryana paid us Rs110-120 but this year we are only able to fetch Rs 70-50 per litre,” he said.Bee-keepers are counting the days till the lockdown is lifted so that they can sell honey to factories.BEES VITAL FOR HIMACHALHimachal Pradesh is one of the biggest producers of fruits in the country with nearly 2.5 lakh hectares of land under fruit cultivation. As such beekeeping plays an important economic and ecological role in the state.The Himachal Pradesh government has encouraged beekeeping through the Mukhya Mantri Vikas Yojana. Under the scheme, 50 beehives per beneficiary will be provided 80% assistance through kail, pine, mango and other woods of specified standard.In each district, keepers with 300 bee colonies will be given Rs 3 lakh per breeder.The government had announced that it will provide 50% assistance up to Rs 50,000 to 100 bee keepers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/bee-keepers-in-himachal-lose-business-amid-lockdown/story-URjTZQ9zS0KQ5RDhW4d22M.html

Though fire-fighting operations are underway, fire officials at the spot said that it was becoming difficult to control the blaze due to the constant wind flow. Eight fire tenders had reached the site at the time of filing this report. The dumping ground sprawls an area of 16 acre near the Durgadi chowk in Kalyan (West). “The fire is massive and all our five fire tenders are at the spot. We also called three additional fire tenders as the fire kept spreading. Due to the wind it is becoming difficult to control the blaze. Our firemen are constantly working on it,” said Dilip Gund, chief fire officer, Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation. The smoke spread around 5 kms radius from the dumping ground, making it difficult for residents to breath. Some people living in the nearby areas said they had been demanding closure of the dumping ground for many years but no action had been taken on their complaint.“I could see the smoke covering the entire sky nearby. We have been demanding the closure of the dumping ground for so many years but nothing has been done so far,” said Sajita Nair, who lives nearby and represents the Alert Citizens Forum that has been fighting for the closure of dump yard. The Adharwadi dumping ground has caught fire several times in the past as well. In January this year, there was a major fire which was doused after 15 hours of fire fighting operations. In 2019, the dumping ground caught fire twice – in March and June.Every day, around 650 metric tonnes of waste is dumped at Adharwadi dumping ground without any segregation and processing by KDMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/fire-at-adharwadi-dumping-ground-in-maharashtra-s-kalyan-8-fire-tenders-at-spot/story-EtdvDDJtcWM82bGFD5Bi3N.html

A bench of justices Manmohan and Sanjeev Narula disposed of the plea, but gave petitioners liberty to move a representation before the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) on the issues raised in the plea. In case the petitioners move a representation to the DMRC, it is supposed to dispose of the plea within four weeks by a reasoned order after taking inputs from authorities concerned. The petitioners had contended in their plea that it should be mandatory for metro travellers to provide proof of their identity and address while purchasing metro cards or tokens to establish ownership in case such items are lost. They also contended that in the prevalent situation of coronavirus pandemic, the DMRC should be aware about the details of commuters as it will help in preventing COVID-19 patients from travelling in metro.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-hc-declines-plea-to-link-metro-card-with-address-proof/story-C85zk7V9Abx6gMQKWADKCJ.html
09-05-2020||Kolkata||Kolkata man becomes 1st Indian to beat Covid-19 after 38 days on ventilator||Nitaidas Mukherjee, a 52-year-old resident of south Kolkata who trumped Covid-19 after being on a ventilator for 38 days, returned home to a hero’s welcome by his neighbours earlier this week.Doctors said that it was a remarkable feat by the hospital authorities and nothing less than a miracle, because a Covid-19 patient remaining on a ventilator for so long has little chance of survival.“I thank the hospital and the team of doctors who gave me a new life. This is my second life, you can say. Without them, I would have been dead by now. They are the actual heroes,” said Mukherjee who returned home on Monday. He has become so weak, that he could hardly speak over the phone.It was in mid-March that Mukherjee - who had suffered a bout of pneumonia in 2017 - developed a severe cough and cold. His family thought that it was the mere return of an ailment that afflicts him frequently. Later he developed fever. “We didn’t have any travel history. But as the symptoms were matching with Covid-19, we decided to take him to a private hospital on March 29. As his condition deteriorated, he was put on a ventilator the same night. The next day, his test results showed positive and his battle with death began,” said Aparajita Mukherjee, Nitaidas’ wife. As his condition worsened, doctors performed a tracheostomy, a surgical procedure to make an incision on the throat and create a direct airway through another incision in the trachea.“Doctors had told me that his condition was extremely precarious. But they never lost hope and continued to fight. I was not sure whether I would be able to see him ever again and prayed to God. He is a social worker and runs a NGO. I believe that the prayers of all those he had helped in the past, worked and helped him to survive,” Aparajita said.In a statement, the hospital said: “He has created a record of sorts in India by being the first patient of Covid-19 to have defeated the virus despite being on ventilator for 38 days.”“This is indeed a remarkable feat. Staying on ventilation and then returning home is something uncommon,” said Sukumar Mukherjee, one of the doctors on the advisory panel set up by Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/kolkata-man-becomes-1st-indian-to-beat-covid-19-after-38-days-on-ventilator/story-kmOxoPp67Z156bY5rgmE8O.html

09-05-2020||Chandigarh||Punjabi University hostels turned into Covid-19 isolation centres, students a harried lot||Around 2,500 Punjabi University students were asked to vacate hostels on Friday evening as a couple of hostels on campus are being converted into isolation centres on the directions of the Patiala district administration. The students were only given 24 hours to vacate their rooms. Students lodging at the Banda Singh Bahadur hostel for boys and Mai Bhago hostel for girls received a communication from the university asking them to vacate their rooms and collect their belongings by Saturday evening.The belongings of those who are unable to come to the campus will be stored and returned once the situation normalises. Students were asked to leave the varsity campus following orders of the state government to shut educational institutions across the state in wake of coronavirus pandemic in March.On Saturday, the university witnessed a heavy rush of students who had come from across the state to collect their belongings.Vikram Singh of Democratic Students’ Union said students from faraway places such as Muktar, Bathinda and Mansa were facing trouble adhering to the 24-hour window. “The students received notices on their mobile phones on Friday evening and were directed to visit the university and take their stuff within 24 hours in times when public transport is shut and there are restrictions on the movement of private vehicles,” he said.Amritpal Kaur, a student, said she had come all the way from Barnala with her father to collect her belongings.“Though we are cooperating with the authorities, we should have received a timely notification,” she said.Ajaib Singh, an activist of the Democratic Students Union, said there were many other buildings lying vacant on campus, and the authorities should have used them as isolation centres instead.Meanwhile, dean students’ welfare (DSW) professor Tara Singh said the varsity was helping the district administration tackle Covid-19.On students being provided a short notice, the DSW said, “Hostel wardens had contacted students before the notice was issued. We are assisting students who are visiting campus to collect their belongings.” Since the official residence of vice-chancellor professor BS Ghuman falls within 100m of the newly setup isolation centre at Mai Bhago hostel, Ghuman’s residence has been temporarily shifted, while wardens and other teaching and non-teaching staff residents have followed suit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjabi-university-hostels-turned-into-covid-19-isolation-centres-students-a-harried-lot/story-q8jXr2a7k0ys0bwewVhQkJ.html

He had made payment of requisite development charges to Beed municipal council on November 8, 2019.However, in March 2020, the civic body noticed that substantial construction of the new hospital building was already done, even before building permission was obtained. On April 13, 2020, the civic body refused the building permissionDr Munde then on April 20, 2020, requested the district collector for permission to operate the hospital claiming that the new hospital building was already constructed and could be used for treating Covid-19 patients.He, however, moved high court after the resident collector on April 25 issued an order shortlisting the unfinished hospital building for the treatment of Covid-19 patients.On Friday, Government pleader DR Kale opposed the doctor’s plea stating the construction was illegal and could not be allowed to be completed.Justice Ravindra Ghuge accepted his contention and rejected the doctor’s plea for interim permission to complete the unfinished building and to operate an OPD and a dialysis unit from the building for Covid-19 patients. The judge said such an interim order “cannot be granted in the face of the illegality, prima facie, indulged into by the petitioner.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-dismisses-doctor-s-plea-to-complete-illegal-hospital-building/story-TVmXrD7VBJlwT3pyTUkP3N.html
09-05-2020||Chandigarh||Fazilka farmers unable to get MSP for mustard||Unable to get the minimum support price for mustard, farmers in Fazilka have been withholding the crop for a month. The minimum support price for the crop is Rs 4,425 per quintal.A progressive farmer Arvind Setia, who has sown mustard over nine acres in Toota Wali village, says private players are offering them between Rs 3,300-3,500 per quintal. This year his farm recorded a yield of around eight quintals an acre and Setia considers it to be a good harvest. However, he blames the state government for poor pricing of mustard. Setia said while boosting crop diversification, the state government should ensure that farmers get a good deal. “In Rajasthan, mustard is being bought at MSP. However, in Punjab farmers are not being paid fixed rates. I have been growing mustard for the last 25 years but farmers are never offered fair prices. The state government failed to ensure the purchase of the crop by a government agency,” said Setia.In the Malwa belt, Fazilka is the key mustard-growing district.‘TIE-UP WITH CENTRE NEEDED’Government officials say since no Central agency is operating in Punjab, farmers have to sell their crop to private players. Chief agriculture officer Manjit Singh says Fazilka has around 6,000 acres land under cultivation. He said the semi-arid Khuian Sarwar block has the maximum concentration of mustard.Singh said mustard is harvested by April-end and purchase was underway.After processing, mustard seed is used to extract mustard oil while cakes are used as cattle feed. Another farmer, Nikhil Kumar, said following the recommendation of the agriculture experts, he had sown mustard on eight-acres, an increase of five acres, at Patti Billa village near Abohar but ended up selling his produce to private players for Rs 3,400 per quintal.‘FARMERS BEING FLEECED’“We are advised to grow mustard to ensure a better yield of wheat and cotton. I followed the advisory but farmers are forced to sell the crop at a much lower price than fixed by the Centre. Farmers are being fleeced,” said Nikhil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/fazilka-farmers-unable-to-get-msp-for-mustard/story-umfbVNvwTcjJhCepaDnGRI.html

With several bootlegging incidents being reported during the lockdown when liquor vends were closed, the SIT will also probe sale of illicit liquor in the state during the period, Haryana Home Minister Anil Vij said. Liquor vends in Haryana were closed from March 27 after the lockdown was announced, but have now reopened from May 6 after the state government decided to open the vends. He said a senior IAS officer -- either Ashok Khemka,  Sanjeev Kaushal or T C Gupta -- will head the SIT while IPS officer Subhash Yadav and Additional Excise Commissioner Vijay Singh will also be its members and jointly investigate the matter. The scope of the SIT, which was earlier to probe the case of seized liquor going missing from the godowns in Sonipat, will now also investigate the sale of illicit liquor, Vij said, according to an official statement. A huge stock of liquor had gone missing from two godowns in Sonipat district and this could not have happened without the connivance of officials, Vij had said on Thursday. As liquor of other states has been found from the godowns, one can only guess that this place had become den of smuggling, Vij said. On May 6, Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar had directed all Deputy Commissioners and Superintendents of Police to constitute district-level teams to check liquor smuggling across the inter-state borders. He had asked them that these teams should be headed by a Magistrate and comprise of officers of police and the Excise and Taxation Department. Besides checking smuggling of illegal liquor across the inter-state borders, these committees will also work to prevent any supply of non-duty-paid liquor from the distilleries to the vends. PTI SUN VSD CK||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/sit-formed-to-probe-sonipat-liquor-godown-issue-illicit-liquor-sale-in-haryana/story-UPQsUL8y3l9aK6855sTjAK.html

The most disturbing aspect is that majority of stubble burning incidents were reported in the areas used for sowing paddy and maize,” said Dhillon.He said people were already reeling under the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown, setting fields on fire would compound the problem.‘PEOPLE WITH WEAK LUNGS AT RISK’“Covid-19 poses a serious threat to people with weak lungs. By indulging in stubble burning aren’t we aggravating the risk? Those with weak lungs will not be able to handle the pollution caused due to stubble burning. It is time to make amends and shun the practice,” said Dhillon. He also recited a sermon by the Sikh master Guru Nanak: ‘Pawan guru, pani pita, mata dhart mahat’. Meanwhile, district agricultural officer Narinder Singh said two cases of stubble burning had been registered in Samrala area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/700-stubble-burning-cases-reported-in-punjab-pau-v-c-condemns-incident/story-8bwKmHZhPttjigQoYvHJsI.html
09-05-2020||Mumbai||Number of Maharashtra citizens quarantined for Covid-19 more than doubles in last 17 days||The number of people quarantined at homes and institutions in Maharashtra has more than doubled in the last 17 days as the state’s coronavirus disease (Covid-19) tally inched closer to the bleak 20,000-mark, according to the state health department data.As of April 21, there were around 107,000 citizens quarantined in the state of which around 99,569 were home quarantined and 7,808 were institutionally quarantined. This increased to 2,39,531 citizens under home quarantined and 13,494 under institutional quarantine, as of Friday. However, in this period the number of cases and tests both increased drastically.The state health department has added a disclaimer to the data it released, saying that 146 patients from Mumbai have been added to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) number of cases on its portal on Thursday, but the reconciliation of that figure is yet to be done. It has also stated that since the collection of data is a progressive process, the numbers could vary.Maharashtra reported 1,089 new infections, taking the tally to 19,063 on Friday. The state also reported 37 deaths, taking the toll to 731. While on April 21, the state had 3,451 positive cases and reported 151 fatalities.Mumbai reported 748 infections and 25 deaths on Friday, bringing its case count to 12,142 and toll to 462. Of the day’s other deaths, 10 were in Pune and one each in Jalgaon and Amravati. Seventeen of the patients who died on Friday were above 60 years of age, while 16 were in the age group of 40-59 years. The remaining were below 40 years of age. Twenty-seven of them had high-risk comorbidities.It is expected that Maharashtra may cross the bleak 20,000-mark on Saturday. If this happens, it would mean the state went from 10,000 Covid-19 cases to 20,000 cases in just nine days, after taking 53 days for the first 10,000. Maharashtra breached the 10,000-mark on April 30, 53 days after the first case was reported on March 9. The state took five days to cross the next 5,000.The mortality rate in the state stood at 3.86%, down from 7.21% on April 12, but the number of deaths is increasing, with 362 deaths in the past 10 days. The country’s mortality rate hovers around 3.35%.In the past 24 hours, the state has carried out 10,245 Covid-19 tests and 1,089 or 10.62% of the people have tested positive. The number of tests in the state touched 212,350 on Friday—192,197 of them were negative. The 13,552 teams of health workers have screened 526,400 people for suspected infection after they came in contact with patients. Out of which 3,470 patients have fully recovered, after testing positive in the past six weeks. Maharashtra has 1,139 containment zones earmarked for the strict lockdown owing to the high number of patients. In Mumbai, the municipal corporation has broken the zones into smaller ones for better monitoring.After Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Friday transferred Mumbai municipal commissioner Praveen Pardeshi to the Urban Development Department (UDD), Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer IS Chahal took charge as the new chief of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) late on Friday. On Friday, Chahal met senior officials to discuss the way ahead for handling the coronavirus pandemic in the city. On Saturday, Chahal is expected to hold a series of review meetings with several ward officers via video conferencing.An expert committee of bureaucrats, including retired IAS officers, constituted to suggest the steps for the revival of the state economy, submitted its report to the state government on Friday. The committee said it will help boost business activities. It has suggested a list to be based on activities precluding social distancing and the activities that are not very critical for the economy.“The demarcation of containment zones should be done in a granular manner. Sector and activities must be opened to a maximum across non-containment zones. A robust web-based monitoring mechanism must be enabled to ensure adherence to these guidelines of lockdown,” the report states.The committee has recommended emphasis on Mumbai by launching a special project to re-start the state’s economy and has asp suggested a special programme to support vulnerable groups like street vendors, drivers, self-employed service providers.It has also recommended addressing individual sectors and activities and new business classes. Ajit Pawar, Maharashtra’s deputy chief minister who also holds the finance portfolio, said the report will now be present before the state cabinet for a final nod.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/number-of-maharashtra-citizens-quarantined-for-covid-19-more-than-doubles-in-last-17-days/story-Qnb3sqP8IiYHvqMKmZ0AUM.html

The silence only broken by the turning of pages or the purring of the owner’s cat? They say reminiscing won’t bring the past back, but a bit of logistical support, a government order, and a whole lot of love has revived independent book stores in the Capital. After certain relaxations in lockdown norms, some bookstores have started home delivery of books and are opening for certain hours through the day. “We are opening on alternate days for now. The response has been phenomenal and we have received orders from within and outside Delhi,” said an employee at The Bookshop in Jor Bagh. “We weren’t prepared for so many calls! It was very heartening. We sold approximately 450 books — both deliveries and in-store purchases — from our Greater Kailash store in one day,” said Priyanka Malhotra, director, Full Circle Bookstore.  This is what's up on our new arrivals shelves.

I am happy that the people are back and are meeting each other again at my shop. We get around 60-65 customers every day and we ensure that they are wearing masks,” he says. The store is open between 11am-6pm, but also takes orders on Whatsapp, which it delivers with the help of a delivery partner. “We have offered 20% discount on books, and the delivery charge by the partner is paid by the customer,” Baig explains.Read: World Book Day: Delhi’s good ol’ booksellers narrate their survival tales amid lockdownSince this is a first time for these bookstores in the deliveries market, teething problems are bound to surface. “The courier services are very expensive at the moment so we are giving the choice to the customer to bear the overcharge. Wherever possible, we are subsidising the courier charges. Within 10km of Jor Bagh, we are using our own car to make deliveries,” informs The Bookshop.This development also comes with a set of health risks, but they are mindful of the safety measures. “Every (Full Circle) bookstore is sanitized five times a day and we only allow two people inside at a time for approximately 15-20 minutes. No one can come in without a mask. We have a guard at the door with sanitizer for people coming in,” says Priyanka.Read: Book your quarantime: On World Book Day, here’s a peek into Bollywood’s bookshelvesAdapting to the new normal and faring against e-commerce giants, Rajni Bahri Malhotra, of Bahrisons, says, “The independent bookseller is still willing to go out of his way and cater to your needs. My staff is amazing — one person is answering the calls, another is taking orders on the messaging platform WhatsApp . Orders are consolidated upon checking our stock. Online payments need to be managed. The books are packaged and handed over to the delivery boys, and a route is charted for them because they can’t make multiple trips. It’s like a small assembly line. But they are thrilled to be back.” Logistically, there have been certain limitations. “Our delivery partner does not cover all of Delhi.

09-05-2020||Delhi||Delhi court rejects bail plea of accused in north-east Delhi riots||A Delhi court on Friday dismissed the bail application of Shahrukh Pathan, accused in the north-east Delhi riots, stating that the fundamental right to protest against government policies cannot extend to disturbing public order.Additional Sessions Judge Sanjeev Kumar Malhotra rejected the bail plea stating that there is video footage that went viral where the accused can be seen pointing a pistol upon police officials and hence he is not inclined to grant bail at this stage.“The right to protest is a fundamental right in a democracy but this right of peaceful protest and open criticism of the government policies does not extend to disturb the public order.“….in the present case, the video footage of the applicant while pointing out pistol upon police officials went viral. Keeping in view the totality of facts and circumstances of the case at this stage, I am not inclined to grant bail to the applicant (Pathan),” the judge said.The court was hearing the bail application filed through advocate Asghar Khan in wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. The plea had contended that the incident happened at the spur of the moment and that the 23-year-old had no past criminal record.The plea also alleged that there was an unexplained delay of two days in registering the FIR. Khan said that the charge sheet has already been filed in the case and his counsel sought bail stating that his father has to undergo a knee surgery.However, the court said that the IO has verified from the hospital regarding operations of knee replacement of Pathan’s father Baldev Singh and as per the hospitals’ email, only emergency surgeries are being performed and total knee replacement is not one of them. A fresh date will be given at a later stage when the situation improves in Jalandhar, the hospital said.Opposing the bail application, the additional public prosecutor told the court that on February 24, several people had gathered illegally and were raising slogans against the amended Anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). According to the complaint, the members of the unlawful assembly had bottles, pistols and stones in their hands. In the meantime, Pathan came from behind and fired 3-4 shots at the people around. The complainant, head constable Deepak Dahiya, requested him (Pathan) not to fire. However, Pathan fired at the head of the constable with the intention to kill. The constable bent down and managed to save himself. When he tried to stop Pathan, he pointed towards the crowd and fired again, according to the complaint.The court, after, hearing the arguments from both sides dismissed the plea. Pathan was arrested on March 3.Last week, Delhi Police had filed the first charge sheet over the February riots in north-east Delhi, naming three men including Pathan, who was pictured pointing a pistol at a policeman in the Maujpur neighbourhood.The 350-page charge sheet was filed in the Karkardooma court against Pathan and two others who were arrested by the crime branch’s Narcotics Cell, said a senior police officer, adding that the three remained in jail.According to the charge sheet, Pathan was the first person to be formally arrested in connection with the riots after being booked by the Jafrabad police. He was initially booked for attempt to murder, assault on a public servant, disobedience of an order passed by a government servant and under the Arms Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-court-rejects-bail-plea-of-accused-in-north-east-delhi-riots/story-wrRVul6j4VZOLCCp9ufKgK.html

09-05-2020||Delhi||AIIMS may reopen OPD, surgical depts in phases next week||The All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), in Delhi is likely to open up its health care services in a phased manner from next week after it shut down all but its emergency services on March 24 following the Covid-19 outbreak.“We’re looking at restarting limited outpatient departments (OPDs) and surgical departments. The opening up will start in a phased manner,” said Dr. Randeep Guleria, director, AIIMS, Delhi.On March 24, the hospital had shut down all its non-emergency departments, including surgical departments and speciality clinics, and only kept its emergency open for non-Covid-19 patients.In early April, the hospital had started a teleconsultation facility for its follow-up cases, where a patient can book an appointment online.“The departments that are managing well through telemedicine will be asked to continue. We’ll begin with semi-emergency and comfortable day-care surgeries that don’t require too much manpower, and also minimal infrastructure,” said Dr. Guleria.In the first phase, gallstone removal, hernia, and other such surgeries will be conducted, as they require fewer number of hospitalisation days, ensuring beds are not occupied for long and also minimum use of ventillators.The hospital has set up its trauma centre and its cancer hospital in Jhajjar, Haryana, as dedicated Covid-19 hospitals.“Dedicated Covid-19 facility goes beyond hospital infrastructure and largely involves nurturing human resources. We’ll have to divide our staff into Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 groups. Simultaneously, we need to keep a close watch on the surge in Covid-19 positive cases. Initially, we’ll start with opening up a limited number of departments, and depending upon how the situation evolves over the next few weeks, we may open up some more, if the Covid-19 curve remains under control,” said Dr. Guleria.“There’s a huge risk of a non-Covid-19 patient testing positive. We’ve had a similar experience recently, where a trauma patient tested Covid-19 positive. The challenge in the gradual opening up of departments is to factor these critical aspects in mind. We’ll have to monitor the evolving situation closely,” he said.“Everything has to be thought through. We’ve to redefine our new normal. The medical practice will undergo a paradigm shift soon,” he added.The central government-run Safdarjung Hospital also opened up its outpatient clinics for new patients from Wednesday.The opening up of more hospitals in the national capital will ease the burden on Delhi government-run hospitals, as most of them have been running on more than 100% capacity.The constraints were drawn to the Centre’s attention by the Delhi government earlier this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/aiims-may-reopen-opd-surgical-depts-in-phases-next-week/story-sltIa4ZqfLkIlZ15Ii1c3O.html
09-05-2020||City||Finding a seat on trains a bigger challenge than an arduous trek back home||For the tech illiterate migrants, who are afraid of running from pillar to post to find a seat on a train home, a trek back to their native, no matter how arduous, is a rather viable option.Carrying heavy luggage on their heads and shoulders amid the scorching heat, a group of six papad hawkers started their 900km journey from Amritsar for Auraiya, Uttar Pradesh, five days ago. Finding cover under a tree near Dhandari Kalan, Ludhiana, on National Highway 44, they caught a breath before walking another 13km to reach Doraha by Friday evening.“We still need to walk 650km. As we covered 180km in five days, it will take around 20 days more to reach our destination,” said 50-year-old Ashiq Ali.The government did announce special trains, said Ali, but when he and some more men went to the nearby police station in Amritsar to apply for seats, the cops didn’t help them. “The policemen rather asked us to visit different offices. We are illiterate and did not know whom to approach, so we decided to cover the distance on foot,” he said.‘ONE CHAPATTI A DAY’Ration supply remains a struggle during this odyssey. Yunus Ali, 20, said though they started their journey with wheat and some pulses, the supplies were running out. “We are carrying utensils, so we cook once a day and eat one chapatti per person to regain our strength. Sometimes, we run across Good Samaritans distributing food among migrants,” he said.The group shared that truck drivers were clearly averse to giving them a ride. They had signalled many for a hitchhike, but no one stopped.Another group of five men was spotted cycling from Giaspura, Ludhiana, to Chandausi, Uttar Pradesh, nearly 450km away. They said they had no idea how to apply for the trains online. “We have suffered immensely since the curfew started on March 23.

Though the official bulletin did not mention the cases, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences (PGIMS) spokesperson Dr Varun Arora confirmed the development and said that they had tested 130 samples from various districts, of which three from Rewari were found positive. A PGIMS doctor pleading anonymity said that the cases include a woman, her daughter and another woman who lives in the same building at Sector 14 in Rewari.“The woman had visited a hospital in Delhi where her mother, cancer patient, is undergoing treatment. However, her brother was also tested positive for the virus in Gurugram,” said the doctor. A day earlier, Mahendergarh district also lost its green tag after two railways constables tested positive. Jhajjar, one of the three districts which did not have a single case till April end, has also become a hotspot in the state since.22 FRESH CASES DETECTED With 22 more positive cases, the Covid-19 tally jumped to 647 in Haryana on Friday.

The labourers have assured us of returning after the pandemic situation improves,” he added.Roshan Lal, a migrant labourer from Araria, said he came from Kurukshetra after officials informed them about the train movement on Thursday evening. He said he was happy to go home, rather than staying in shelter homes without any work.“My parents were worried and used to ask about my return every day. The state government had provided us with good food and accommodation at the shelter homes,” he added.Meanwhile, the migrant workers who had come from Sirsa were disappointment as they were sent back due to lack of space in the train.“We were excited to return home, but our hopes were dashed when the Rohtak administration told us the train was fully packed and we would have to wait for the next one. Why did the officials call us if the seats were already full,” the workers asked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/shramik-special-haryana-s-4th-train-leaves-with-1-204-migrants-from-rohtak/story-uKJpAkaMYTG6HEHXPe6xEP.html
09-05-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: In the blazing summer, the amaltas blooms... and so does the gulmohar||The world economies are in shambles. Untold number of people worldwide have lost their jobs. A great many are dead. The pandemic is transforming the world. There’s no knowing when the nightmare will end. Everybody’s life has turned upside down.But one thing has remained unchanged. The blazing summer has begun and the amaltas has returned like a steady and steadfast guest. It is again starting to bloom, a brilliant, defiant yellow. As if its flowery branches were trying to whisper to these catastrophic times, “You can’t beat us.”Just yesterday morning, a small amaltas tree was spotted in a south Delhi neighbourhood, its branches newly loaded with bunches of golden-yellow flowers. And in a coincidence too fantastic to be believed, a young man was seen standing directly under these flowers, wearing a mask that had exactly the same shade of yellow.The sight was indescribably heart-touching. Throughout the year, trees of amaltas look rather unremarkable. But in the summer months, when the city gets so hot it is almost unbearable, they suddenly get sheathed with layers of shining blossoms, and their flowers keep falling on the ground in a kind of silent and magical shower.To experience amaltas at its most divine, a walk through central Delhi avenues such as Hailey Road and Amrita Shergill Marg makes for a necessary pilgrimage. Then there is North Delhi’s Bungalow Road... but sorry! The world has changed. One cannot freely navigate through the city any longer. Who knows when the coronavirus crisis will come under control. It might happen only long after the amaltas bloom is over, and that is June.Do not despair, however. Many of us are now obliged to start going to our workplace following the lockdown’s partial relaxation. And one anyway still has to walk to the shop around the corner to get necessary groceries. And each time you step out of the house, you are likely to be reassured by the sighting of at least one amaltas blooming in your area.And it’s not only about amaltas.The day a young man in a yellow mask was spotted admiring the yellow amaltas, this reporter also spotted a woman in red mask admiring the red flowers of a gulmohar (coincidence!).Those trees are in bloom too, and their beauty is as uplifting. And, much like the amaltas, the gulmohars are also popping up in various parts of the city—each tree looming up like a flame. The woman was staring up at the red flowers for a long time, while the late morning sun was tucking itself behind the foliage, its blinding glow as focused as a reading lamp. It was difficult to discern the woman’s expressions because of the mask, but she must have felt moved. For she took out her mobile and clicked a picture before moving on to a supermarket ahead.Indeed, some of these blossoming amaltas and gulmohars of Delhi’s are so overwhelming in their bright colours that a chance encounter might momentarily make the spectator forget about the everyday tensions, even about the raging coronavirus. And that must count as winning a battle, if not the war.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-in-the-blazing-summer-the-amaltas-blooms-and-so-does-the-gulmohar/story-io3rGOIx0bMDUObXfUyaKM.html
09-05-2020||City||Ludhiana their karmabhoomi, migrants say they will return||For thousands of migrants leaving the city for want of money and food, their connection with Ludhiana is not over, as most believe they will return to their karmabhoomi once the lockdown is over.Around 4,500 migrants boarded four Shramik Special trains from Ludhiana on Friday. These were headed to Saharsa and Sitamarhi in Bihar, Pratapgarh in Uttar Pradesh and Daltonganj in Jharkhand.“Today, we are left with no work and money. Factory owners have made it clear they are not in a condition to pay salaries, while there is no regular supply of ration from the administration either. This has made it difficult for us to survive in Ludhiana,” said Nizamuddin Ansari, 28, who lived in Chhawani Mohalla and was travelling to Sitamarhi.Ansari said he had worked in Ludhiana as a tailor in hosiery units for the past four years, but it was not the end. “I will return after spending a few months at home. Hopefully, the factories will also reopen by then,” he said.Dinesh Yadav, 38, who lived in Sukhdev Nagar, has assured his employer that he will be back. “I have worked as a tailor in hosiery factories for 10 years. I know the business and understand that my employer cannot pay me. Therefore, I have informed my boss that I am going back home and will return when business resumes,” he said, adding that his employer had allowed him to leave.There are also migrants, who want to return home, despite job opportunities. Ismail Ansari, 35, of Jeewan Nagar said he needed to go home to look after his agricultural land. I had planned to go in March, but couldn’t due to the lockdown. “I will return after handling pending work back home,” he said.DELAYED TRAINS: MP BITTU HOLDS MEETINGLocal member of Parliament chaired a meeting at the Guru Nanak Stadium on Friday to take a stock of the Shramik Special trains.The meeting was attended by MLAs Surinder Dawar and Sanjay Talwar, mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu, Ludhiana Improvement Trust chairman Raman Balasubramaniam, deputy commissioner Pradeep Kumar Agrawal, commissioner of police Rakesh Kumar Agrawal, municipal corporation commissioner Kanwalpreet Kaur Brar and several other senior officials from various departments.DC Agrawal shared that 11 trains had departed from Ludhiana for various states, including Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand and Madhya Pradesh since May 5. Over 12,000 migrants had left the city on these trains.He said the operations were being streamlined and more trains will run in the coming days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-their-karmabhoomi-migrants-say-they-will-return/story-i859dGlXJDzqh4pi05puPK.html

On this, the SDM reached there and asked Kumar to cooperate. This led to a heated argument between the two.When asked, Ahlawat told the media that he was on duty there when the cops stopped Kumar’s car and asked him to park it at a spot, but the latter started arguing with them. “When I asked him to comply with the rules, he threatened to report to my senior officials. If needed, the department will take action against him accordingly,” the SDM said.Kumar, on the other hand, said he was going towards Barwala town where his office is situated. “I was going for work, but the officer stopped me.

09-05-2020||City||Restaurants in Ludhiana allowed home delivery from 7am to 7pm||Closed since the curfew was clamped on March 23, food businesses in the district have been allowed to resume home deliveries between 7am and 7pm without curfew passes from May 9.However, no dine-in or takeaway services will be allowed in these establishments, including restaurants, eateries, ice-cream parlours, juice shops and sweet shops. Restaurants were shortly given relaxation in the second week of April as well, but the permissions were rolled back on April 16 after a delivery boy was found Covid-19 positive in Delhi and 72 families were quarantined. Deputy commissioner Pradeep Kumar Agrawal said no special pass will be required to open the establishments. “But, only home delivery has been allowed. There will be no dine-in or takeaway services,” he added.The owners of these businesses will have to abide by all precautions while running the operations and delivering food, he said.This includes checking the temperature of the employees and maintaining a record; frequent cleaning/disinfection of workplace; wearing of face mask, which should be changed daily; social distancing; hygienic packaging of food items; and frequent cleaning of delivery vehicle.The administration has also directed the businesses to conform to zero contact delivery, which entails not touching any points at delivery location, including doorbells. All delivery boys need to wear gloves and masks.Any violation will invite criminal proceedings under the relevant provisions of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, and the Indian Penal Code.CONCERNED OVER MIGRATION OF WORKERS, HOTEL BODY HAILS MOVEMembers of the Ludhiana Restaurants and Hotels Association, who had opposed the relaxation in April, have now hailed the move, while raising concerns over reverse migration of workers.Association president Amarvir Singh said while restaurant owners were already reeling under losses due to the lockdown, migrants leaving for their home states had compounded their troubles.“How will the businesses run if there are no workers? The prolonged lockdown has also affected the restaurant industry,” said Singh, adding that restaurants owners will comply with all guidelines. Hailing the decision, Narinder Pal Singh Pappu, president of Halwai Association, Punjab, said reopening businesses will help retain workers, who were out of jobs and money.CONGRESS DECRIES RELAXATIONCongress councillor Parvinder Lapran said the decision seemed to have been taken in haste even when Ludhiana was listed in red zones. “Business owners should themselves think about the risks involved and avoid resuming their operations. Residents should also avoid ordering food, and take all precautions if they cannot help it,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/restaurants-in-ludhiana-allowed-home-delivery-from-7am-to-7pm/story-MV7prEY1J71FpkXXgT5YlJ.html

09-05-2020||Mumbai||TB, HIV patients in Arthur Road prison are at a greater risk of contracting Covid, say experts||With several inmates at Arthur Road Jail infected with tuberculosis (TB) and HIV, health experts are worried that the number of Covid-positive people at the premises can increase. The jail has currently 103 Covid-19 cases. Deepak Pandey, inspector general of police (south region) of state prisons department, did not respond to repeated calls and messages. Arthur Road prison has a capacity of 800 but houses 2,600 inmates currently. The situation is the same at the city’s other major jail at Byculla, where over 500 prisoners are squeezed into a space meant for 200 people. As per data procured from the Mumbai District Aids Control Society (MDACS), there are 22 inmates with HIV at Arthur Road Jail while 29 HIV patients are at Byculla Jail, including 14 from the women’s jail. There are 18 TB patients at Arthur Road Jail as per the state tuberculosis department. Due to overcrowding in the jails with common bathrooms and mess rooms, it is difficult to stop the spread of the infection, say health experts. Prisoners living with HIV and TB have higher chances of contracting the infection due to low immunity. “There is a need to make special arrangements for such vulnerable prisoners. Jail authorities should have followed the international guidelines to stop the spread,” said Blessi Kumar, of the Delhi-based Global Coalition of TB Activists (GCTA).During the outbreak of the virus in China, prisons had turned into a breeding ground for the disease. As of February 25, there were 555 confirmed infections in five prisons of three provinces — Hubei, Shandong, and Zhejiang.Taking note of it, the World Health Organization released prison guidelines—Preparedness, prevention and control of Covid-19 in prisons. It recommended screening of all inmates and special provision for patients with blood-borne viruses, TB and drug use disorders. “Particular attention should be paid to persons with contagious diseases...refined allocation procedures should be considered that would allow prisoners at highest risk to be separated from others,” read the guidelines. But when HT contacted recently released prisoners from both the jails, they claimed that there is no provision of hygiene, social distancing and lack of sensitisation at the prisons. A 42-year-old HIV-positive inmate, who recently got discharged from Byculla Jail, said, “For over 500 prisoners, there were only 4 common bathrooms. We bathed together and slept with over 30 prisoners in a cell.” He was at the jail for three months. Avinash Roy, a state lawyer, spoke about one of his clients who is infected with TB and is an inmate at Arthur Road Jail. Despite getting approval for his bail, due to the lockdown, the inmate’s family couldn’t complete his security procedure to bring him out of the jail. “When my client’s family tried talking to the jail authority, they said that his being inside the jail is safer. Who will take responsibility if anything happens to him?” he said. Dr Pranita Tipre, head of TB department, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) said, “The jails have isolation facilities where they will keep the suspected patients. But so far, we haven’t received any instructions from the jails for testing all the TB patients.”Health activists have criticised jail authorities for not taking provisional measures. Eldred Tellis, executive director, Sankalp Rehabilitation Trust said, “These prisoners should be given preventive medicines like HCQ or Ayurveda. They keep using the same mask for days without sanitising it. Plus, they aren’t even given gloves. The food given in jails is of poor quality which doesn’t even boost immunity.”As per experts, as these inmates have already compromised health, conditions, if they contract the infection, the mortality rate can become higher. “Their early diagnosis is necessary for timely treatment, increasing their chances of recovery,” said Ganesh Acharya, a TB/HIV activist. During the initial days of the nation-wide lockdown, there was a gap of 7 to 8 days in the procurement of HIV drugs in jails. Taking note of this, MDACS provided medicines for a month in advance to the prisons. “It is important to keep the viral load (presence of HIV in blood) in the body under control. With regular intake of medicines, the patients are at a lesser risk of contracting the infection,” said Dr Srikala Acharya, additional project director of MDACS.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/tb-hiv-patients-in-arthur-road-prison-are-at-a-greater-risk-of-contracting-covid-say-experts/story-cq0E99f2UscTWiJY9V2j6K.html
09-05-2020||Chandigarh||Delay in Covid-19 reports of pregnant women putting staff, other patients at risk at Chandigarh’s GMSH-16||Within a span of eight days, three asymptomatic pregnant women who delivered babies at the Government Multi-Specialty Hospital in Sector 16 have turned out to be Covid positive.The delays in test reports of the pregnant women has not only given a tough time to the doctors, but also put other pregnant women and staff at the hospital at risk.On April 30, a woman from Bapu Dham Colony delivered a baby in the hospital and the next day reports revealed that she was infected. She became the first positive pregnant woman of Chandigarh.A week later, on May 5, a 20-year-old woman from Maloya delivered a baby. The same day, a 24-year-old from SBS Nagar was admitted and her C-section took place at 12:29am on May 7.A highly placed source within the GMSH-16 said: “Following the guidelines of the Indian Council of Medical Research, which recommend that every pregnant woman in a containment zone should be tested, the samples of both women were sent on May 5 itself, but reports came on May 8.” Both tested Covid positive. By that time, however, both women had undergone deliveries.LABOUR ROOMS ARE OVERCROWDED“Labour rooms in government hospitals are overcrowded. No matter how many precautions we take, there are always chances of spread. We must know on time whether the patient is positive or not, so that we can isolate them,” said a staffer, wishing not to be named.The staff member further said: “The samples of positive women should be treated on priority and reports should come within 6-7 hours. But we are getting reports after 48 hours, which is too late, and by the time deliveries are done.”According to experts, the ICMR guidelines came on April 20 and after that they started taking samples of all pregnant women (except those who come in emergency and their deliveries can’t wait).Another GMSH-16 official said: “One of the infected women was given intubation, which is quite risky as chances of getting infection are more.”ALL WOMEN ASYMPTOMATICTalking about precautionary measures, an official said: “The worrisome part is all women are asymptomatic. So we have to fumigate the operation theatres after every C-section. We raise an alarm so that corridors are vacated when a suspected mother is brought to the OT and then sent back to a separate room. We are trying our best to isolate suspects but due to patient rush, we have to keep two in one room.”An official said: “Patient load is more at a government hospital, staff is limited and now we have to quarantine them, fumigate OTs, so we cannot take additional burden from other states, who should manage their own patients.”Daily, there are around 15 admissions from Chandigarh and around eight from the adjoining states.An official added: “This afternoon, an ambulance from Nalagarh dropped two pregnant women at the door-step of GMSH-16 and when a guard ran after the ambulance to stop it, it fled. The card they were carrying read, ‘There is no C-section facility at Nalagarh’.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/delay-in-covid-19-reports-of-pregnant-women-putting-staff-other-patients-at-risk-at-chandigarh-s-gmsh-16/story-puRfEyIEfRFLMQrA7H9QPL.html

09-05-2020||Chandigarh||8 out of 9 Covid-19 deaths at PGIMER due to other co-occurring illnesses||Out of the nine deaths that have occurred due to Covid-19 at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), eight persons had co-morbid conditions.Co-morbodity refers to the presence of one or more additional medical conditions co-occurring with a primary condition such as coronary artery diseases, diabetes, hypertension and chronic kidney diseases.Among the persons who died, two had both hypertension as well as chronic kidney disease; another two had diabetes; one had hypertension as well as diabetes; and two persons had only coronary artery disease. The youngest among the deceased was a six-month-old girl who had congenital heart disease.The average age of the patients who died due to the virus was 48 years. Dr Digambar Behera, senior professor, department of pulmonary medicine, PGIMER, said when a virus like this infects a person it causes a cytokine (small proteins important in cell signaling) storm in the body. Thus, other illnesses alter the defence system and a number of reactions take place which cannot be easily managed.“When people with underlying diseases like diabetes develop a viral infection, it can be harder to treat them due to fluctuations in blood glucose levels. Same is the condition with other diseases,” Dr Behera said.He added, “The immune system of such patients is compromised making it difficult to fight the virus. We need to make sure that persons with such problems are taken care of and medicines are available to them.”Dr GD Puri, head of anesthesia and intensive care, said that the institute was trying to decrease the mortality due to the virus. “In patients with other diseases we try to contain the underlying disease which ultimately can save a life. Basically it is also done in anticipation of what may go wrong in the patient with such diseases and that is why we try to control it before it gets worse.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/8-out-of-9-covid-19-deaths-at-pgimer-due-to-other-co-occurring-illnesses/story-Nag27mSCEi49UtyJi9hlAP.html

Kalyan Shiv Sena corporator Ravi Patil on Friday spoke to the chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray and Thane guardian minister Eknath Shinde on the issue. There are 203 students from Maharashtra, who are stranded in the Central Asian country.“The parents are worried as Kyrgyzstan is not mentioned in the central government’s list of countries from where the armed forces will get the stranded Indians. Some parents from my ward had called me asking for help. I have requested the CM to look into the matter as there are around 203 students from Maharashtra who are studying there as per a list compiled by the students,” said Patil.The parents of the students claimed that due to the pandemic, the institutes have been closed in Kyrgyzstan, but students are attending online classes and giving exams.“My son Pratik, who is in his second year of MBBS course, said students can’t move out of the campus due to the lockdown. They are worried about getting back to India after the exams. There is no proper process undertaken to ensure they return home. We want our government to take the issue up and make arrangements for their return,” said Titwala resident Sunil Diwan, 50, Pratik’s father.Another parent claimed that his son is facing difficulties in finding food as there are no shops in his area.“Students are unable to get timely supplies as there are no such shops around. My son told me they filled up some forms. But there is not clarity about their return,” said Ravindra Waje, 51, a resident of Kalyan (East), whose son Deepak, 24, is in his fourth year of MBBS degree at Osh University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/parents-of-students-stranded-in-kyrgyzstan-appeal-to-government-to-bring-their-kids-back/story-qLxKG6UvvVoLpwH5fQ9Q7J.html

On Tuesday, however, only a few mats could be seen.“Business is over for us now; ever since we were relocated we have barely earned anything. People still associate cooler mats with Sector 22, and we are back on our spots in the heat of May,” says Sheetal Kumar whose family has been making and selling cooler mats in Sector 22 for the past 60 years.“We are mindful of the Covid-19 crisis and maintain all standards of hygiene,” he says, pointing towards a bottle of sanitizer. He was allocated a spot at the Sector 15 vending zone, but he says it was of no use going there as customers didn’t come to the vending zones to buy cooler mats.The mats made of vetiver grass (khus khus) that were the specialty of these mat makers remain absent, while only a handful of bamboo and straw mats can be seen now. “We are selling only 10% of the mats that we used to, so we’re only making the simplest and most inexpensive ones,” says Sanju, another mat maker. The mats that used to sell for ₹400 last year are being sold for ₹350 now. Balwinder Singh, a third generation mat maker, says they aren’t making even 10% of the money they used to back in the day. “Due to the coronavirus outbreak and because of the delayed summer season, not many customers are buying the mats. We have to stay mindful of the MC vehicles passing by as any moment we can be asked to leave. I haven’t been allotted a vending space since December so I came back to set up shop here,” he said.Local area councillor Ravikant Sharma said he hadn’t passed by this area in the past few days, however, he said that the mat makers are unauthorised and he will coordinate with the MC teams to get them relocated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/cooler-mat-makers-return-to-chandigarh-s-sector-22-market-to-try-their-luck/story-9S2Hy4XT3XZnM1LGUWiT0I.html
09-05-2020||Mumbai||Final-year exams for undergraduate courses in Maharashtra between July 1 and 30: Minister||After weeks of confusion, higher and technical education minister Uday Samant on Friday clarified that the state will hold exams of all final-year undergraduate (UG) courses between July 1 and 30, while all students in other years of their UG courses will be promoted to the next academic year. “All the university students, except those in the final year of their graduation course, will be promoted to the next academic year by their respective universities. Final-year students, as of this date, will be appearing for their exams between July 1 and 30,” said Samant during a Facebook Live session held in the afternoon, after several students posed across the state posed the question. The development has come less than a week after a University Grants Commission (UGC)-appointed committee released a report recommending similar directives to universities across the country.During his interaction, Samant said the final-year exam dates will be clarified in the coming days and but if the lockdown, owing to the ongoing Covid-19 outbreak, is extended beyond June 30, the state will again hold a meeting between June 20 and 25 to confirm their next decision on the status of final-year exams. “As of now, we expect the respective universities to ensure that a timetable is ready for all final-year students and the results for all exams are announced by August 15 so that the next academic year can begin by first week of September,” he said.For the first and second-year students, the state has decided to adopt UGC’s recommendation and promote students based on a 50-50% gradation formula, in which 50% will be allocated for a student’s performance in internals and other projects in the current semester and 50% for the student’s performance in the previous semester. “Students who have allowed-to-keep-term (ATKT) remarks for any subject from the previous semester will be promoted for the time being, but will have 120 days once the new academic year starts to appear for an exam and clear the subject,” added Samant.“We may have to cut short the exam time from 3 hours to 2 hours, or we moght also decide to take a 50 mark theory exam instead of 80 or 100 marks, but such decisions will be left to the university. We also suggest each of the university decide on the summer vacation dates and inform students accordingly,” said Samant, and added that any practical exams, including VIVAs should be taken online in order to maintain social distancing rules.All university and professional course examinations has been held back due to the ongoing lockdown situation but all state governments were asked to clarify their stand recently by the Union human resource development (HRD) ministry, based on UGC recommendations.Samant also pointed out at the UGC’s minimum compulsory attendance rule for students and said that the 45 days of lockdown should be considered by institutes as time spent in college by all students and added to the current attendance record of students. The education minister has also requested universities to set up help desks and call centres in their respective districts to ensure that all queries of students and parents are answered and to also set up online counselling helplines for the benefit of students and parents affected by the lockdown.Calming nerves of Class 12 students who are waiting to hear the news on the entrance examination dates for professional courses, which is to be conducted by state common entrance test (CET) cell, Samant clarified that the CET officials along with officials from the Directorate of Technical Education (DTE) are currently working on the schedule, which will be shared within the next eight days.What did Uday Samant say during the interaction||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/final-year-exams-for-undergraduate-courses-in-maharashtra-between-july-1-and-30-minister/story-6hMAKLDP34lO0CCcUs8mvO.html
09-05-2020||Mumbai||Mathematical model by IISER predicts dip in nationwide Covid cases by mid-May||A new mathematical model by Kolkata-based Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) has predicted that if the current nationwide lockdown continues, active Covid-19 infections in India are likely to start decreasing by the second week of May and the cycle of the disease in the first phase is likely to end between early to mid-July.This means the number of those infected - denoted by the reproduction number R0 - will drop to 0.5 under the scenario of stringent lockdown or quarantining all infected individuals. R0 (R nought) is a measure of the number of individuals who may contract the infection from one Covid-positive patient. IISER’s model has calculated Covid-19’s reproduction number at R5 at the start of the lockdown.Active infections simulated by the model comprises individuals tested positive for the novel coronavirus as well as those who are asymptomatic - the latter are not considered in official infection numbers.“Assuming the strength of the lockdown is not relaxed and continues till early July, our prediction is that active infections will keep rising and reach a peak before beginning to fall around May 17. The first wave will end by mid-July when patient recovery rates reach saturation point,” said Dibyendu Nandi, professor and lead researcher, IISER. “If the numbers don’t start falling in the next seven days, it will imply that the lockdown saw relaxations this week. However, if the lockdown is relaxed, active infections will peak early August and the numbers will be catastrophic.”The model’s algorithm has calculated 60,000 active infections (best case scenario) as the peak, and the upper range at 1.35 lakh as the worst case scenario, assuming transmission rates will be higher.Had the lockdown started end of February, the model estimated that the total number of active infections would not exceed 20,000; the peak would be less than 10,000; and India would be nearing the end of the first wave.With vulnerable groups such as daily wage labourers and migrants impacted the most, IISER researchers said the best strategy to bring the pandemic’s first wave under control is to undertake active testing, contact tracing quarantine and containment of serious hotspots and slowly relax lockdown.“Since India has not reached peak infections, the situation is more dangerous now than the beginning of the lockdown because of the higher number of infected individuals in the system. Completely lifting the lockdown therefore will remove any advantages that the country has so far achieved,” said Nandi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mathematical-model-by-iiser-predicts-dip-in-nationwide-covid-cases-by-mid-may/story-2NHWKyNppOuds1Tq1DQPBJ.html

The app will also help in working out schemes for their welfare.Yogi, who later reviewed the lockdown situation and progress made about bringing back migrant labourers at a high level meeting, said the largest number of trains carrying migrants have reached the state.The chief minister said the list of returnee migrant labourers should be obtained from the states they have returned to check any unauthorised entry. He said all migrant labourers should be treated with respect in the state.Yogi said the lockdown should be strictly implemented and no one, except medical and health teams, sanitation workers and delivery boys, should be allowed in hotspots. He said the districts should remain connected with IAS and senior PCS officers sent there to help district magistrates in monitoring quarantine centres and community kitchens etc. He said fire tenders should be used for sanitisation work in their respective districts. The chief minister said the state had been able to keep Covid-19 cases under control by setting up Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 hospitals, separately. He said availability of all medical resources should be ensured in all hospitals 24X7.Yogi said medical history of Covid-19 patients should be maintained. He also said fodder banks should be established to ensure availability of fodder.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/yogi-launches-app-to-connect-migrants-with-schemes-jobs/story-v9NIJvOD5DDzcNrxsKIw3M.html
09-05-2020||Mumbai||Praveen Pardeshi out: Split within bureaucracy to blame?||When the coronavirus pandemic first hit Mumbai on March 11, the then civic chief of the country’s financial capital, Praveen Pardeshi, was seen in the political and bureaucratic circles as the right person for the job on hand.A 1985-batch IAS [Indian Administrative Service] officer, Pardeshi had cut his teeth in administration as a young collector in Latur in 1993, when he oversaw the relief and rehabilitation efforts in the district, after the devastating earthquake that year.Seen as an efficient and a politically suave bureaucrat, Pardeshi had moved to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) last year in May, after heading the chief minister’s office (CMO) for four-and-a-half years in Devendra Fadnavis’s regime. As the principal secretary, and later as the additional chief secretary in CMO, Pardeshi ran the state secretariat from his sixth-floor office, often calling the shots, rather than the incumbent chief secretary, and was even derided as the ‘second CM’ by those in the Opposition.He was not replaced as the civic chief even after Uddhav Thackeray took over the reins of the state, breaking away from Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and joining hands with the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP).Until Friday, when he was unceremoniously transferred smack midway from tackling the pandemic, Pardeshi had a good run in administration.While one year is a short time to assess his performance as the BMC chief, he seemed to have done reasonably well. As the city civic chief, he had focussed on completing ongoing infra projects, rationalising expenditure, taking up environment-friendly measures such as planning urban forests, incentivising BEST (Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport) revamp and exploring more tourist venues for the entertainment-starved Mumbai. His 2020 budget included even a rather ambitious and lofty notion of a happiness index for the citizenry.And at the beginning of the pandemic, he seemed to be on a strong footing. Pardeshi took a stand to increase the number of tests and successfully did that in Mumbai (current testing stands at 7,000 per million). The city was also one of the first to start stringent contact tracing and undertake containment strategies to stop the spread of the virus. Things however, started going awry for the former civic chief, as the as the coronavirus cases continued to rise in Mumbai, breaching the 10,000-mark this week, with the disease curve refusing to flatten. It didn’t help that he did not get along with the state’s chief secretary, Ajoy Mehta, Pardeshi’s predecessor in the BMC.With increasing pressure from the Centre to tackle the pandemic in Mumbai better, and complaints increasing from various quarters on the ground against hospitals, testing protocols and relief work, the political leadership decided to shift out the sitting bureaucratic leadership in favour of newer leadership, said a senior bureaucrat.Sources within the state administration blamed the ongoing cold war between Pardeshi and Mehta, as one of the central reasons for the former’s transfer orders.“The CM was receiving complaints from various quarters about mismanagement in hospitals, testing protocols and overall confusion within the BMC ranks, as well as the apparent lack of co-ordination between the BMC and the state administration,’’ added a bureaucrat, who did not wish to be namedThis week, the lack of co-ordination between the state and BMC was on display, as the state government issued a notification on extending the guidelines in Maharashtra, amended it the next day to have it over ruled in Mumbai by the BMC chief the same evening. The BMC chief also amended his notification a day later after nudged by the state. The split within the bureaucrats in the state was evident for a while now. Earlier, a team of bureaucrats from the state, including Manisha Mhaiskar and Ashwini Bhide, were appointed as a part of the Covid-19 taskforce to the BMC.Leader of Opposition in the legislative Council, Pravin Darekar, said, “It has been evident for the past many days that there is no co-ordination between the state government and the civic administration and this was impacting on ground response to Covid-19. We had pointed this out to the CM in the meeting on Thursday. I don’t know if the war between Mehta and Pardeshi is over but it did expose the weak chinks in the administration and governance while tackling coronavirus. Generally, there is no precedent to undertake such transfers midway during an emergency situation.’’Thackeray, who gave a wide berth to the issue of transfer in his direct address to citizens on Thursday late evening, did indicate that he was upset over the incident at Sion Hospital this week, where patients were being treated next to a dead body.“This kind of shoddiness and mismanagement will not be tolerated in the hospitals,’’ he said.With Iqbal Chahal, former urban development department (UDD) secretary as the new civic chief, Mehta, it is said, has got his man to helm the BMC. With both, former Thane commissioner Sanjeev Jaiswal and former Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation (MMRC) chief Ashwini Bhide, seen as competent bureaucrats, appointed as additional commissioners in BMC, Mehta hopes to bring in better co-ordination between the state and the civic body.Whether, this can in any way flatten the Covid-19 curve in Mumbai, is yet to be seen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/praveen-pardeshi-out-split-within-bureaucracy-to-blame/story-0KiU0rKYpVKvZpNePFR7sO.html

However, on Friday, 51 new containment zones were also added, taking the total containment zones/sealed buildings in Dharavi to 253.” The BMC has now chalked out a plan to open Mumbai’s first containment zone at Worli Koliwada. Sharad Ughade, assistant commissioner of G South ward, which comprises Worli Koliwada, said, “We have kept the koliwada under supervision, and have a de-containment plan for it. It will be released gradually.”G South ward recorded around 730 Covid-19 cases, of which 369 patients have recovered. Ughade said, “The situation is under control in Worli, and we do not have the kind of outbreak as we had in the first few days when the cases came to light. Every day, there are 17-18 new cases in the whole of the ward.”SION Hospital acting dean transferredA day after a video from Sion Hospital showing coronavirus patients lying next to dead bodies in a ward went viral, Dr Pramod Ingale, the acting dean of the hospital, has been transferred back to biochemistry department. Dr Ramesh Bharmal, the former dean of BYL Nair Hospital will now take charge of Sion Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/25-cases-push-dharavi-s-coronavirus-count-to-808/story-mviblfHDLCwFRcYwU1HqvI.html

09-05-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab CM Amarinder writes to PM; seeks MSP of Rs 2,902 for paddy||Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh has written a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to consider fixing a Minimum Support Price (MSP) of Rs 2,902 per quintal for paddy and Rs 100 per quintal to be given as incentive bonus to check stubble burning. The CM has cited challenges faced due to labour shortage and the need for ensuring food security in view of the covid-19 pandemic.In his letter to the PM, the CM said that the state had already written to the Union agriculture ministry seeking the new MSP, as calculated by Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana, against last year’s MSP of Rs 1,835 per quintal.“Given the need to ensure food safety in the time of the present pandemic, it is imperative that farmers may be given the appropriate price signal by announcing a remunerative MSP for paddy,” Amarinder’s letter says, adding, “It is unlikely that we will see much seasonal labour coming from UP and Bihar for paddy transplantation due to covid.” The CM expressed concern at the serious challenges this could pose for farming operations in the paddy season, besides leading to escalation in labour costs. He also underscored the importance of providing farmers a non-burning bonus at the rate of Rs 100 per quintal to meet their expenses in handling of paddy straw, thus preventing its burning. In this context, he also pointed to Supreme Court directions, asking the Centre and the states to work out an incentive structure to check paddy stubble burning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-cm-amarinder-writes-to-pm-seeks-msp-of-rs-2-902-for-paddy/story-yMzUTqbXaIdlu1mwrHPICM.html
09-05-2020||Chandigarh||Amid labour shortage, Punjab advances paddy transplantation by a week||Amid labour shortage caused by ongoing exodus of migrant workers, the Punjab government has decided to advance the start of paddy transplantation by a week from June 20 to June 13.The matter was discussed by the state cabinet on Friday and approved by chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh, who is also in-charge of the agriculture department. A notification in this regard is likely to be issued on Saturday.Officials said the decision has been taken to facilitate staggered paddy sowing in view of the Covid-9 pandemic, when labour is scanty and social distancing protocol has to be maintained.Additional chief secretary (development) Viswajeet Khanna said the issue was discussed threadbare and the decision to advance paddy transplantation was taken due to shortage of labour.However, the Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), which drives the research related to the crops, has been educating farmers to prepare for start of transplantation at the stipulated time (June 20).The PAU was not in favour of changing the transplantation schedule keeping in view the acute fall of sub-soil water table across the state.“Water is important, but we also can’t afford to jeopardise a season’s crop when we are passing through tough times as a pandemic has engulfed the entire world,” Khanna said while talking to HT.Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal had demanded advancement of paddy transplantation to June 1.Gunbir Singh Sodhi, a farmer from Ferozpur, said, “We are facing acute shortage of labour. We are not getting labour to transplant paddy saplings. Most of the labourers have left for their home states. We have asked the government to advance paddy transplantation by three weeks.”PAU vice-chancellor (V-C) BS Dhillon told HT that due to the unprecedented scenario, it was decided to take a chance this time with early transplantation. “This shouldn’t be made a yearly practice as water is precious,” he cautioned.By an estimate of the state agriculture department, 12.5 lakh labour heads are required to sow paddy in 30 days.Paddy is a major kharif crop in the state, which is expected to be sown over 70 lakh acre in the coming season.DSR VARIETY ON NOT MORE THAN ONE-THIRD AREA The agriculture department also decided that out of the total area under paddy in the coming season, direct seeding rice (DSR) variety should not be sown over more than one-third area. “No doubt, trials with DSR variety have shown good results, but the total area with the new method can’t be more than one-third of the total cultivated area. We have to be on a safe side,” said Khanna.1,386 WHEAT STUBBLE FIRES IN TWO DAYS Meanwhile, a sudden spurt in cases of wheat stubble burning on Thursday and Friday took the number of farm fires in the state to1,615 so far. As many as 722 cases of stubble burning were reported on Thursday, followed by 664 on Friday. “We never imagined the cases would rise so fast and farmers wouldn’t understand the gravity of situation, especially when coronavirus has also spread its tentacles,” said Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) member secretary Krunesh Garg.On Friday, most of the farm fire cases were reported from southwest Punjab: Bathinda (104), Barnala (85), Ferozepur (67), Mansa (48), Hoshiarpur (32), Kapurthala (28), Ludhiana (26), Patiala (23), Muktsar (21) and Fazilka (18).Additional chief secretary (development) Viswajeet Khanna said he has asked deputy commissioners to act tough against the errant farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/amid-labour-shortage-punjab-advances-paddy-transplantation-by-a-week/story-mECeYolt4LIgVl8mTInD7L.html

In this period, from May 3 to May 7, Mumbai recorded 194 new deaths. Also, by Thursday evening, 2,435 people were discharged from hospitals, bringing the percentage of recovered patients to 21.70.The city saw 411 cases on May 3, 510 on May 4, 635 on May 5, 769 on May 6 and 692 on May 7. The death rate stayed in the 3.83%-3.89% range in this period. Mumbai’s case count on Friday was 12,142, with 462 deaths.On Friday, Dharavi, India’s largest slum, recorded 25 new cases, taking the tally to 808 with 26 deaths. In the past three days, a team of 14 doctors has screened more than 15,000 people for possible coronavirus symptoms, of which 86 samples have been sent to the laboratory, said a BMC official.BMC chief Praveen Pardeshi, who was ousted on Friday, told HT on Thursday: “Coronavirus cases are increasing, but we have to check the doubling rate. The cases are now doubling in 10 days, which was earlier 3-4 days. The numbers are also increasing because a lot of pending reports are coming out now.”Dr Daksha Shah, deputy executive health officer, BMC, said more than 70% patients are asymptomatic. “The number of positive cases is increasing day by day because the BMC is conducting tests at a daily average of 4,000-4,500.At the same time, we brought down the death rate to 3.86%, which is near the national average of 3.35%.”She said most of the deaths are from the age group of 50 years and above. In this group, patients have comorbidities such as high blood pressure, cancer and diabetes.Meanwhile on Friday, the BMC cancelled its April 30 order and issued a fresh order allowing only 75% of its staff to attend office to maintain social distancing. The April 30 order made 100 % attendance mandatory for all employees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-saw-26-of-coronavirus-cases-in-past-100-hours/story-KVC8MHtv51Qph48mWYGHWK.html
09-05-2020||City||Fresh case in Panchkula after 18 days, count reaches 19||Haryana’s Panchkula district reported a fresh Covid-19 case after 18 days, as a 44-year-old milk vendor was found infected at the congested rehabilitation Rajiv Colony near Sector 17 on Friday. It has taken the total number of confirmed cases in the district to 19, though 17 of the patients have already been discharged. The last case was reported from Pinjore’s Nava Nagar village on April 20. Civil surgeon Jasjeet Kaur said containment strategy has been immediately put in place at Rajiv Colony so that the virus does not spread further. “We conducted random sampling in Rajiv Colony, during which the case surfaced. The patient’s condition is stable and he has been been moved to the isolation ward of the civil hospital,” she said. “His five family members have also been shifted to the civil hospital for testing.” Dr Kaur said the man is into milk vending business in the colony and also runs a small confectionery shop.“We are identifying his contact list and accordingly quaratine exercise will follow,” she said.Congested colony a new challengePanchkula, like Chandigarh, got its first case in mid-March, but the number of cases did not spike after a family of nine in Sector 15 and seven people with Tablighi link were tested positive. However, Rajiv Colony poses a new challenge, even as the Panchkula health department and district administration have been strict in enforcing rules. It is a densly populated area, where social distancing is hard to enforce as people stay in very small houses, very much like Chandigarh’s Bapu Dham Colony, which accounts for 60% of the UT’s cases.A health official, who did not wish to be named, said Rajiv Colony would definitely pose a challenge as all resources need to be diverted to it to screen individuals, identify high risk persons and restrict movement within the colony.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/fresh-case-in-panchkula-after-18-days-count-reaches-19/story-GraoFWJVzKy5gYcdgvKerM.html

The first day saw just 55 bail applications being listed for hearing but no proper arrangements to ensure social distancing among lawyers or staff inside the compound was seen. “More than 500 lawyers were allowed entry inside campus though only 55 cases were listed for hearing,” complained many lawyers.An official with a temperature gun was standing on the main gate who was testing the temperature of everyone entering the compound.However, no arrangements were made to cross check whether any lawyer who was entering the compound had his cases listed before the court or not. Also, many were not even wearing any mask or covering their face as is mandatory as per set guidelines. “High Court had recently issued guidelines in which it was specifically said that only those advocates must be allowed entry inside court premises who had their case listed for hearing but no steps were made to ensure compliance. Anyone was allowed entry inside the compound after checking his temperature,” said advocate Manish Khanna, who practices at district court.On the other hand, lawyers in high court were facing another problem. Court administration had set up a temporary counters for e-filing of cases but due to the limited number of counters, infrastructure and staff, case filing was taking more than usual time and no arrangements were made to ensure social distancing among lawyers or their staff who were standing in queues.“I waited for more than an hour in the queue to file a bail application, it was an urgent matter but then I decided to return as neither social distancing was maintained in the queue nor any official with a temperature gun was there to check symptoms of COVID-19 in people who were standing in the line. I felt as if I am not only risking my life but also the life of my family member, “said advocate Susheel Tiwari, an advocate of Allahabad high court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/prayagraj-district-court-opens-after-48-days-no-signs-social-distancing/story-8EZeSbkNesaGisMkqp4AkO.html

09-05-2020||Mumbai||Munde, Khadse, Tawde and Bawankule left out of BJP Legislative Council nomination||Sidelining party seniors including former ministers Pankaja Munde, Eknath Khadse, Chandrakant Bawankule and Vinod Tawde, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Friday nominated four candidates to the legislative Council polls to be held on May 21.Those who were nominated include `Dhangar’ leader (shepherd community), Gopichand Padalkar; Ranjitsinh Mohite Patil, former Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) MP, who joined the BJP ahead of 2019 Lok Sabha polls, Pravin Dakte, Nagpur city chief of the party and Ajit Gopchade, a doctor from Nanded and president of BJP’s state medical cell. A BJP party communication confirmed the development.While Munde lost the assembly polls, Khadse, Tawde and Bawankule had been dropped by the party leadership from contesting polls. All the four leaders were hoping for rehabilitation and it was widely expected that at least one of them would get accommodated given that the BJP lacks experienced leaders in the Upper House.The selection of the candidates also indicates that the BJP top brass has endorsed state leadership led by former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis.“Fadnavis continues to have a say in the state matters. The nomination of these four candidates points to that. At the same time, this is also a signal from party top brass that it won’t overlook rebellion within the party. While Munde had held a mega rally in Beed, where she criticised the party, Khadse has openly voiced his discontent,” said a senior BJP functionary.Padalkar joined the BJP at the behest of Fadnavis and contested polls against NCP leader and incumbent Deputy Chief Ajit Pawar from his pocket borough in Baramati. Mohite Patil was promised MLC post last year when he joined BJP with his father, VijaySinh by Fadnavis.Datke, seen to be close to Union minister Nitin Gadkari as well as Fadnavis, has got an opportunity instead of Bawankule. This is despite feedback that the BJP lost some of the seats in Vidarbha in the state assembly polls as a direct result of dropping Bawankule, a `Teli’ community (one of the OBC castes) leader. Gopchade’s nomination has come as a surprise. He is from Nanded, where the BJP has fielded several leaders to combat Congress leader and former Chief Minister Ashok Chavan.Khadse post-state assembly polls had alleged that he had lost poll ticket due to Fadnavis and former minister Girish Mahajan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/munde-khadse-tawde-and-bawankule-left-out-of-bjp-legislative-council-nomination/story-tmspj3w3aY6bqMxXjDD2DK.html

Migrants like Dar have been in this business for the last 15 years. Every year, they come to the district when winters are about to commence in November and return home in the beginning of March. With the lockdown imposed due to the novel coronavirus, around 40 Kashmiri shawl sellers have been stuck in the city.“We rent a room for a few months and roam around in the district selling winter clothes. This time, it was a good season and I expected to earn a handsome profit which would contribute to my family’s growth. But I’m stuck here and have exhausted all the profits. I haven’t been able to send home any money and my mother is a diabetic patient,” said Dar.“We have tried to meet the deputy commissioner (DC) at least thrice, but to no avail. We also tried to meet the sub-divisional magistrate (SDM), but there was no response from her side as well,” he said, adding “We’re illiterate and don’t know about the online registration procedure. But a few locals helped us and we are expecting to receive a message.”On May 5, some local Congress workers met a group of migrants staying in Baldev Nagar and helped them by registering their details on the online portal for their travel-related permissions. District coordinator Devender Verma said, “We raised the issue before the administration and an IAS-ranked officer asked us to help the migrants in registering online. But they have not received any response yet.”Meanwhile, DC Ashok Kumar Sharma and Ambala city SDM Gauri Midha could not be reached for an official comment despite several attempts.50 STUDENTS STUCK IN MULLANAIn Ambala’s Mullana area, around 50 Kashmiri students, including 20 females, from different educational backgrounds have been stuck due to the lockdown. Most of them are studying at Maharishi Markandeshwar University (MMU), with some staying in the hostel and others in nearby PGs. Many have applied for travel passes with the district administration and the UT (Kashmir) administration, but they have not received any response. “A few students had managed to leave for their homes. We have been staying here since the lockdown was announced and most of us could not leave at that time because of pending assignments, exams and financial constraints. Earlier, it was very difficult to sustain and even get a proper meal. Now, the situation has comparatively improved, but we are broke and need to be with our families,” said Zahoor Abbas, 27, a research scholar at the university.He further said, “We have applied for passes with the district magistrate office and the nodal officers in Kashmir, but I feel that there is a communication gap between both the administrations. The officers in Kashmir told us that they are waiting for an evacuation order and the local officers told us that they are waiting for a response from Kashmir.”The chief warden of the university, JK Sharma, said that the students are yet to receive a response from both the authorities. “Our only concern is that whenever there is any evacuation plan from the authorities, we want our students to reach home safely. Till now, we are providing online classes and mess facilities to them,” Sharma said.‘PROCESS HAS STARTED, EVACUATION WILL TAKE TIME’Akhil Pilani, IAS, (under training) at the DC office said, “We met the migrants at the office and they have been registered on the state portal. There are a lot of registrations on the site at the moment, but their details have reached. We expect their return after a few days as the process to send migrants home is going on in phases.” He added that the same process will be followed for the students.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/miles-from-home-90-kashmiris-stuck-in-ambala-wait-for-their-chance-to-return/story-c9PVmJnu1x2T12Mdx8PqsK.html

09-05-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai civic chief Praveen Pardeshi transferred, IS Chahal replaces him||Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Friday transferred Mumbai municipal commissioner Praveen Pardeshi and two other additional commissioners amid the rising number of coronavirus cases in the city.IS Chahal will take charge as the new chief of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), while Sanjeev Jaiswal and Ashwini Bhide have been appointed additional municipal commissioners, replacing Abasaheb Jarhad and Jayshree Bhoj, said a senior official. Pardeshi will now take position as the additional chief secretary of the urban development department.The state government has been facing criticism for the rapid rise in cases, especially in Mumbai. Till Friday evening, Mumbai accounted for 12,142 of the state’s 19,063 cases. The Thackeray government is under tremendous pressure to control the outbreak in Mumbai, the financial capital of the country. Union health minister Harsh Vardhan had recently expressed concern over the rise in cases in the state. Although Pardeshi and his team were seen as working hard to counter the outbreak, cases have been spiralling for quite some time. The decision is being seen as an attempt to show that the state government is taking tough measures. Pardeshi has a reputation of being a hard-working and efficient official and has handled several significant assignments, which is why Thackeray’s decision has surprised many in the state government circles. Before Friday’s developments, Chahal was the principal secretary of the urban development department. Jaiswal’s last posting was as the Thane civic chief, while Bhide was head of the Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation, which is building the underground Metro-3. Both officials had been appreciated for their work during their previous postings.Jarhad has been appointed as secretary, relief and rehabilitation department, and Bhoj has been posted as managing director, Maharashtra Small Scale Industries Development Corporation (MSSIDC).A 1985-batch officer, Pardeshi was a key member of former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis’s core team since he became CM in November 2014. Pardeshi took charge as the civic chief last May and held on to his post, despite the change in the state’s regime in November last year. Jaiswal, former chief of the Thane municipal corporation, was awaiting a posting, while Bhide was already working with the BMC as member of the task force to contain the epidemic. Jarhad has replaced Kishor Raje Nimbalkar, who has been posted as secretary, public works department. Chahal is a 1989 batch officer who was appointed as principal secretary of urban development department only in February this year. Before that, he was heading the water resources department as principal secretary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-chief-praveen-pardeshi-transferred-is-chahal-replaces-him/story-ygXRn4N03TuQIDd7H3N4eL.html
09-05-2020||Mumbai||State inches towards 20,000 Covid-19 cases||Maharashtra on Friday inched closer to the bleak 20,000 mark for coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases as it reported 1,089 new infections, taking the tally to 19,063. The state also reported 37 deaths, taking the toll to 731. Mumbai reported 748 infections and 25 deaths on Friday, bringing its case count to 12,142 and toll to 462. The state health department has added a disclaimer to the data it released, saying that 146 patients from Mumbai have been added to the ICMR data of cases on its portal on Thursday, but the reconciliation of that figure is yet to be done. It has also stated that since the collection of data is a progressive process, the numbers could vary.Of the day’s other deaths, 10 were in Pune and one each in Jalgaon and Amravati. Seventeen of the patients who died on Friday were above 60 years of age, while 16 were in the age group of 40-59 years. The remaining were below 40 years of age. Twenty-seven of them had high-risk comorbidities.Expecting the state to cross the 20,000 mark on Saturday, it would mean the state took just nine days to go from 10,000 to 20,000 cases, after taking 53 days for the first 10,000. The mortality rate in the state stood at 3.86%, down from 7.21% on April 12, but the number of deaths is increasing, with 362 deaths in the past 10 days. The country’s mortality rate hovers around 3.35%.In the past 24 hours, the state has carried out 10,245 coronavirus tests and 1,089 people have tested positive, which is 10.62% of the total people tested. The number of tests in the state touched 2,12,350 on Friday. 1,92,197 of them were negative. 1,39,531 people are currently under home quarantine, while 13,494 are under institutional quarantine. 13,552 teams of health workers have screened 52.64 lakh people for suspected infection, after they came in contact with patients. 3,470 patients have fully recovered from various hospitals, after testing positive in the past six weeks. State has 1,139 containment zones earmarked for the strict lockdown owing to the high number of patients. In Mumbai, the municipal corporation has broken the zones into smaller ones for better monitoring.Maharashtra breached the 10,000 mark on April 30, 53 days since the first case on March 9. The state took five days to cross the next 5,000.Meanwhile, the tragic rail accident where 16 migrant workers were mowed down by a train in Aurangabad on Friday morning led to a blame game between governments. The state government has blamed it on the Centre for the delay in response to the state’s demand for special trains to evacuate migrants. But at the same time, the authorities are facing criticism within for the failure of the district administration in putting migrants in shelter camps.“Allowing the migrants to walk on the highways and railway tracks was a big flaw in the system. They were walking for the past four-five days on the highways in the absence of means to travel back to their homes. They should have been given confidence about the travelling arrangements to return,” said a minister, requesting anonymity.Ruling Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) have criticised BJP-ruled states like Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Karnataka, alleging that the states have been refusing entry to the migrants going back from Maharashtra. Congress leader and revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat said on Friday that that owing to the delay in permissions from other states, the evacuation has been delayed. “We have more than 10 lakh migrant workers who want to go back to their respective states. 32 Shramik trains have so far departed from various stations in Maharashtra, but a few states are not giving permission as quickly as expected. The entire process of sending these migrants is intricate and time-consuming and needs quick response from the receiving states,” Thorat said.An expert committee of bureaucrats, including retired IAS officers, constituted to suggest the steps for the revival of the state economy, submitted its report to the state government on Friday. The committee said it will help boost business activities. It has suggested a list to be based on activities precluding social distancing and the activities that are not very critical for economy. “The demarcation of containment zones should be done in a granular manner. Sector and activities must be opened to a maximum across non-containment zones. A robust web-based monitoring mechanism must be enabled to ensure adherence to these guidelines of lockdown,” the report believably states.The committee has also recommended emphasis on Mumbai by launching a special project to re-start the state economy and has also suggested a special programme to support vulnerable groups like street venders, drivers, self-employed service providers. It has also recommended addressing individual sectors and activities and new business classes. Deputy chief and finance minister Ajit Pawar said that report will now be kept before the state cabinet for a final nod.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/state-inches-towards-20-000-covid-19-cases/story-4d8dbkwo2QrlHo0Wk1pf1J.html

09-05-2020||Mumbai||Stay fee hikes, allow parents to make partial payments: Edu department tells schools||After days of confusion over the payment of fees for private schools across the state, the education department on Friday released a government resolution (GR) listing out guidelines for the same. In the GR, the department has asked schools to allow parents to make partial payments of fees for academic years 2019-20 and 2020-21 considering the current situation. Schools have also been asked to stay all fee hikes and have in fact been advised to reduce fees in cases where the expenditure has gone down due to the lockdown. The GR is applicable for all schools under the state irrespective of the board they are affiliated with. “Parent-teacher associations of the schools can be told about the status of spending and fees can be cut down with their consent. Similarly, parents should be allowed to pay fees online and schools should not insist on physical payments,” read the GR. “It is a good move considering that most schools are saving a lot on electricity and other maintenance-related work due to school closure. The question, however, is whether these schools would be honest enough to accept it and reduce fees,” said a parent from a Dadar-based school. On March 30, the education department had issued a circular to all the schools asking them to not insist for payments from parents. After the circular, however, several schools told their teachers that they could not pay them their dues as parents had not paid fees. With many teachers writing to the department to come up with a solution, it has now decided to allow schools to collect partial payments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/stay-fee-hikes-allow-parents-to-make-partial-payments-edu-department-tells-schools/story-4xKZ6Zcp2CRu0HZHv1uXvI.html
09-05-2020||Chandigarh||Covid outbreak: Haryana chief secretary urges top bureaucrats to tighten belts||Haryana chief secretary Keshni Anand Arora has urged all administrative secretaries to explore austerity measures urgently by identifying the areas where the departments can squeeze the expenditure.According to the chief secretary, the economy of the state is enduring an “enormous setback” due to the lockdown and the state is facing an “unprecedented resource crunch.”Before the lockdown was imposed due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), Haryana was a revenue surplus state. Now, the state is struggling to release salary and pension on time. Till Friday, a major section of the employees, especially above Class-III, had not received the last month salary. In this backdrop, the chief secretary, on May 6, wrote letters to all the top-ranking bureaucrats, asking them to inform the finance department as well as her office by May 11 about the steps taken or proposed to be taken to reduce expenditure.“...I request all administrative secretaries to identify areas in which expenditure could be curtailed or rationalised by holding detailed discussions with your head of departments and all other officers concerned,” said Arora in her communication. The finance department will circulate comprehensive instructions on austerity measures to all the departments and autonomous bodies.In the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, the chief secretary has said, “The state government machinery is functioning under extreme stress to provide relief measures. On the other hand, there has been a manifold increase in expenditure on account of upgrade of medical facilities...financial assistance and supply of free ration to the poor and stranded labour.”As per the letter, the state government has decided to take a slew of austerity measures to curb the revenue expenditure due to “extreme resource crunch.” Arora said: “The state government has imposed a ban on the purchase of new vehicles and has decided to defer all new recruitment for government jobs for a year.”The chief secretary has advised against purchase of luxury items such as air conditioners, expensive furniture, unnecessary domestic or foreign travel, promotional activities, including holding seminars/workshops in luxury hotels, expenditure on avoidable repair works etc “unless it is very essential.” “This will save scarce resources for priority and more productive use,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/coronavirus-lockdown-haryana-chief-secretary-urges-top-bureaucrats-to-tighten-belts/story-45elUXv6C4I0QhSRebYiNI.html

He added that this demand is being raised repeatedly, but since state health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu seems resistant to it, the chief minister should intervene in the matter, immediately.Dr Cheema said that many health workers do not have separate accommodation and are unable to maintain adequate social distancing from their near and dear ones, including small children and elderly people.He said that many health workers are even ready to live separately from their families, keeping in view the need for safety. They should be provided alternate accommodation by the state government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/sad-asks-punjab-cm-to-provide-separate-stay-facilities-to-health-staff/story-ebad06TyrvbOcwVQixmg8I.html

09-05-2020||Pune||Pune Municipal Corporation to distribute ration kits to 70,000 families in containment zones||In a bid to limit the movement of people in containment zones, the Pune Municipal Corporation will distribute ration kits to 70,000 families in the containment zones, an official said.According to Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol, the main reason for the covid spread is that people form slum areas venture out to purchase essential items. Another source of the spread is community toilets.“To control the citizens’ movement in containment zones, we decided to give free ration kits. The door-to-door distribution of the kits will begin from Saturday. Each ration kit contains grocery worth Rs 800. These kits will have the PMC logo on it,” said Mohol.“We want people in the containment zones to stay indoors and not venture out even to buy essentials. We will distribute one lakh ration kits to 70,000 families in these areas,” municipal commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad said.These kits will contain five kg of flour, three kg of rice, pulses, oil and other essential items that can last up to a week. Along with the kit, masks and sanitisers are also being distributed, he said.Mohol said that all the elected members contributed Rs 10 lakh from their ward development fund for this cause. The MLAs and MPs also contributed from their respective funds. “Earlier, the administration did not permit us to distribute kits free to a large population, but, as elected members we forced the administration to supply kits in every home as it would help curb the spread, said Mohol.”“The PMC has asked grocery shop owners to supply these kits at a fixed rate along with the packaging at a fixed rate. Instead of floating a tender for this initiative, the PMC is directly purchasing goods from open market as there is time constraint. Community workers and civic employees will distribute these kits,” added Mohol.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pmc-to-distribute-ration-kits-to-70-000-families-in-containment-zones/story-VURXELFUfwwTnKAgHzLpYJ.html

09-05-2020||Gurugram||Two vegetable vendors from Khandsa Mandi go missing after testing positive for Covid-19||Two vegetable vendors who had tested positive for coronavirus disease (Covid-19) allegedly went missing from Khandsa Mandi on Wednesday, the police said. According to the police, their samples were collected by a team of health officials last Saturday along with other people who work at the wholesale fruit and vegetable market.The police have lodged an FIR in the matter based on a complaint by a medical officer.The police said one of the vegetable sellers is from Haryana, while the other is from Uttar Pradesh. On May 2, a team of health officials had collected samples of multiple people for tests against the deadly disease.In the police complaint, Dr Rahul Aggarwal said that reports of 10 people, including the two suspects, whose samples were collected on Saturday came back positive for Covid-19 on Wednesday. The complaint said when the team of health officials went to the mandi on Wednesday to take the positive patients to an isolation center the two men were found missing. “The two men are roaming around freely and they might be infecting other people too,” the medical officer added in the FIR. “As precautionary measure, we do not tell the results immediately to anyone who tests positive for Covid-19. We do not want to scare them off. However, in this case, both men ran away even before they were told about their condition,” Dr Aggarwal said. Ashok Kumar, station house officer (SHO), Shivaji Nagar police station, said, “The men had tested positive for Covid-19 and have been missing since Wednesday. They are yet to be located and arrested. We are investigating the case.”A case was registered against the two suspects under sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life), 270 malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and 271 (disobedience to quarantine rule) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and section 51 of the Disaster Management Act at Shivaji Nagar police station on Thursday, police said.According to the health department, a total of 21 people have tested positive for Covid-19 at Khanda Mandi so far. The vegetable market was shut down on Tuesday for sanitisation and will reopen on Saturday.This is the second incident of a coronavirus patient running away to be reported since the beginning of May. An 18-year-old man was arrested on Thursday for allegedly running away after testing positive for Covid-19 and hiding at his relative’s house in Sector 10. According to the police, he also worked at the Khandsa Mandi as a vegetable vendor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/two-vegetable-vedors-from-khandsa-mandi-go-missing-after-testing-positive-for-covid-19/story-wDxzorvXubgKCUn8RjVWJM.html
09-05-2020||Delhi||Criminal action likely against 567 foreign Jamaat attendees; Indians to be released||The Delhi government on Friday said criminal proceedings was likely to be initiated against 567 foreign members of Tablighi Jamaat who were staying at various quarantine centres across the city, while it also started the process of releasing Indian members of the Jamaat.More than 3,000 Tablighi Jamaat members, who were evacuated from the Nizamuddin Markaz in mid-March, have been under institutional quarantine, after finishing their mandatory 28-day quarantine. On Friday, while 2,446 Indian Tablighi Jamaat members were allowed to start preparing to leave for their homes, trouble started brewing for their foreign counterparts, who too have been in the city’s quarantine centres.“Foreign members of the religious outfit will be handed over to the police for criminal proceedings as per law. There are 567 of them and all of them will face criminal charges since there were passport as well as visa violations. So, we are not going to release them yet,” said a senior Delhi government official. A second official in the Delhi government said that out of over 2,400 Tablighi Jamaat members who will be released, 191 are from Delhi.“The chief secretary today (on Friday) issued directions to the additional chief secretary (home) to ensure that the Tablighis of Delhi are released forthwith. Those from other states are being allowed to return via privately arranged transport as per standard operating procedure laid down by the Union ministry of home affairs (MHA),” the official said . For those who are unable to arrange transport on their own, the Delhi government will provide them with DTC buses, with all necessary precautions, for their inter-state movement.“Today, there was no movement with regard to their release from the quarantine centres. The Indian Tablighis were apprised that they can leave once they have arranged for their own transport. They will have to give the vehicle number and the route to the district administration, who will issue travel passes after scrutiny,” the official said.“Indians from the Tablighi Jamaat are being released on orders. But foreigners related to Jamaat will be handled by the Union ministry of external affairs. This is because their visas have also expired and the matters is beyond the jurisdiction of the Delhi government,” Delhi health minister Satyendra Jain said . Jain added that necessary orders have been issued for the release of Indian Jamaatis. A March gathering of Tablighi Jamaat in Nizamuddin in Delhi has been blamed by health authorities for the spread of Covid cases across the country. As of Friday, Delhi had witnessed 6,318 cases of Covid-19. Of these, at least 1,080 are linked to the markaz.On May 3, Delhi’s health department had written to the MHA seeking directions for the release of the Tablighi Jamaat members citing “mounting pressures”.“Since a month has already passed after the completion of Markaz evacuation, the persons shifted from these masjids to various hospitals and quarantine facilities are restless to go back to their respective states/countries. As on today, all the 3,013 persons have not only tested negative but also completed more than 28 days of stay in hospitals/quarantine facilities. Administration is having a tough time convincing these persons for their extended stay, more so during the holy month of Ramzan,” Delhi secretary (health and family welfare) Padmini Singla had written to the additional secretary (UT), MHA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/2-446-indian-tablighi-jamaat-members-to-be-released-others-may-face-criminal-proceedings/story-CZyMPcQwGc5qfP6yClkSgN.html
09-05-2020||Delhi||By offering alcohol delivery, fake websites defraud many in Delhi||While the Delhi government is still considering whether or not to allow the home delivery of liquor in the Capital, the idea has already opened a window of opportunity for fraudsters who are cheating customers through fake websites that promise doorstep delivery of alcohol.Over the last few days, officials in the Delhi excise department say they have found about 20 incidents of people being tricked into making online payments for the home delivery of liquor bottles, which never arrived.On Wednesday, the department -- through its assistant commissioner Alok Kumar -- filed a complaint with the Delhi Police listing several fake websites that were offering the home delivery of liquor. “We have come across nearly 20 similar frauds despite the excise rules in Delhi not allowing any individuals or websites to sell liquor online, or accept orders for home delivery. There is no such approval from the Delhi government. We have filed a complaint with the city police, seeking registration of a case and investigation to nab such fraudsters,” Kumar said.The complaint has been forwarded to Delhi Police’s crime branch. “We have received the complaint and are looking into it. A first information report (FIR) would be registered as soon as we complete our initial inquiry,” said Praveer Ranjan, special commissioner of police (crime).Almost 20 people have been duped, each for varying amounts between Rs 1,000 and Rs 10,000, totalling to over Rs 1 lakh, the police said. A crime branch official familiar with the matter said that some of these websites came up in the last couple of days, soon after a discussion in the Delhi government started over the possibility of home delivery to reduce crowding at liquor shops and avoid the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The people running these websites promised to deliver alcohol, of different kinds and brands, within two-three hours of the orders being placed. However, after accepting online payments, no such delivery was made to the customers. When the customers tried contacting the cellphone numbers listed on the sites, they were either switched off or out of order, the officer cited above said, explaining the modus operandi.“The websites were also later found unavailable. Some people who were duped complained about the excise department about it. As many such complaints arrived, the excise department filed a complaint. We are trying to identify and nab such mischievous elements,” added the officer, who asked not to be named.Amit Singh, a student from west Delhi who was duped of Rs 1,760, said that he had seen a website link for the home delivery of liquor on a social media group. Singh visited the website and got in touch with its executive through online chat. The executive tricked him into believing that the government had authorised them to deliver alcohol. “They were charging double the original rate of the alcohol, attributing it to the tax hike and home delivery charges. I paid Rs 1,760 for six bottles of beer and shared the screenshot of the payment. He promised to deliver the consignment within a day. But it never came. I filed a complaint with the excise department,” Singh said.Liquor shops opened this week after a 43-day hiatus owing to the national lockdown, and have been overrun, with long queues, and frequent violations of social distancing norms.Though the home delivery of liquor has not be cleared yet, the Delhi government on Thursday announced an e-token system to avoid crowding. The tokens -- specifying the store and time slot for purchase -- can be procured from a web link (https://www.qtoken.in/) set up by the excise department, the government said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/by-offering-alcohol-delivery-fake-websites-defraud-many/story-s8X7Te5IfX3gnpHMvjEvXM.html
09-05-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt may set up a web page, app for home delivery of liquor||The Delhi government is working on setting up a web page—and deliberating on creating a mobile phone application—to enable the home delivery of liquor in the Capital, as a measure to reduce the massive crowds outside the limited number of open liquor shops. With the scaling down of the lockdown measures earlier this week, people started thronging the few liquor shops open for business.“We are drafting a standard operating protocol. So far, the excise department has had three meetings on this with the chief secretary and at least one with the finance minister (Manish Sisodia),” a senior government official said on Friday.Another senior government official said, “The weblink is in progress but the app will need several technological changes. So, we require more time. The process would need to include a tie-up with a reliable payment gateway as well. The government has plans to launch the link by Monday.”On Friday, the Supreme Court observed that states should consider the indirect sale of liquor, either online or through the home delivery mechanism to ensure social distancing norms are not violated. So far, several states including Punjab, Chhattisgarh and West Bengal, have initiated the process of enabling the home delivery of liquor.Currently, the guidelines of the Union home ministry state that the e-commerce delivery of goods is limited to essentials (which does not include liquor) in red zones (all 11 districts of Delhi are red zones). Also, the Delhi Excise Act 2009 prohibits the buying and selling of liquor online.“However, a temporary provision can still be made under the ambit of other laws, such as the Disaster Management Act,” the official said.On Friday, the Delhi government also rolled out a web link with which it started issuing e-tokens, specifying the stores and timings, for residents to avoid crowds outside the shops and pick up liquor during allotted time slots.“Any person can apply for an e-token through the link ‘https://www.qtoken.in/’. His/her name and phone number will be required while applying. The e-coupon will be sent to the registered mobile number. With that e-token, the person will be allowed to buy liquor from the nearby shop,” a statement issued by the government read.Getting the tokens via the web link on Saturday, however, was a distant dream for most people with the page constantly reporting a ‘server error’. There were problems in the back-end too, due to which, a senior government official said, the excise department could not summarise the data on the total number of e-coupons issued on the first day.Government officials maintained that it was because of too much traffic on the page and the issue would be resolved at the earliest. Excise commissioner Ravi Dhawan did not respond to phone calls and messages for comment on the issue.Delhi has 864 liquor shops, of which only 172 have received permission to open so far, as they are ‘stand-alone shops’—which means they are not located in markets, malls and commercial spaces, which the central government guidelines prohibit for red zone districts.The government is open to the idea of allowing private liquor shops to operate too, but a survey by the municipal corporations showed that only 30 of them across the city qualify as ‘stand-alone’ shops.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-govt-to-set-up-a-web-page-app-for-home-delivery-of-liquor/story-OhvACyJIQ787VCBhqSe2AM.html

The clarification was issued in a new order in which Dev stated that no fresh or separate permission, including passes, is required for any activity, such as movement in private cars or two-wheelers.It reiterated that all rules and relations laid down by the government on May 3 remain intact. In cars, a driver and two passengers are allowed and no one is allowed to ride pillion on two-wheelers. No relaxations are allowed in containment zones. The clarification came in the wake of complaints from several quarters, where it was reported that RWAs were not allowing domestic helpers, electricians and other self-employed service providers to enter residential colonies or housing societies.

A second flight from Dhaka in Bangladesh, earlier scheduled to land in Delhi on Friday as well, was re-routed to Srinagar as all passengers on-board were from Jammu & Kashmir.While passengers who landed in Delhi said it took most of them only around 30 minutes to complete their medical screening, immigration check, collect luggage and clear customs at the airport, some complained of long waiting hours, and said there was no social distancing on board the flight.After completing their checks at the airport, passengers were sent to hotels around the city for mandatory 14-day quarantine.A Delhi resident, whose 74-year-old father-in-law and friend’s 68-year-old father were travelling, said the two left the airport only around 4pm, even though the flight landed around noon.“Their flight had landed before 12pm, but there was a long waiting time. My father-in-law has blood pressure problems and my friend’s father is diabetic. They had left Singapore at 8am. They said they were only offered a packet of biscuits, some chocolate and juice, a bun and some fruit during the flight. But nothing was given after the flight, even though by the time they reached the hotel, it was almost 6pm,” said the woman, who wished not to be named. She said after arriving in Delhi, the two men were put in separate groups, based on their home states. “Since both of them are old, we wanted them to stay together but one of them is from West Bengal and the other from Uttar Pradesh, and based on this they were sent to different hotels, in Dwarka and Noida,” she said.Some passengers also took to social media. One of them tweeted to the government of Rajasthan requesting deputation of an executive from the state at the airport. The passenger said that while there were representatives of other states, there was none from Rajasthan. He requested arrangements for him to be sent to Jodhpur, Rajasthan.However, according to special secretary (health and family welfare), Shilpa Shinde, who is also the nodal officer for the operation, the entire process “went smoothly”.“The passengers did not have to wait for long hours to get through the entire process. It all went smoothly. From the airport, they are being ferried in government buses to the paid quarantine facilities,” she said.Shinde added that the passengers were given an option to choose from a set of hotels, which have been roped in to set up quarantine facilities.An airport official, wishing not to be identified, said it took them not more than 25 to 35 minutes per person on an average for screening the passengers, escorting them to dedicated immigration counters for clearance, helping them collect their luggage and then reaching the triage area passing through the customs.At the triage area at the airport, the director-general of health services (DGHS) had deputed as many as 20 health teams, comprising doctors and paramedical staff, to conduct screening of all passengers.The CISF, which led the escort team, had also made additional deployment to streamline and expedite the process, officials said, on condition of anonymity. Senior officials involved in the movement of the passengers, requesting anonymity, said that most of them were taken to hotel IBIS and hotel Red Fox in Aerocity. Some opted for Le Meridian in Central Delhi.“We have received around 15 people so far and have readied dedicated floors for them with separate entries. The rooms have been kept minimal so that the dedicated housekeeping team does not have to visit them frequently,” said Meena Bhatia, general manager of the Le Meridian. When it comes to food, Bhatia said the hotel has kept the menu “close to home cooked food”.“Since they have been away from home for a long time, we are starting with fresh, homely meals for them which will be served in disposable boxes in their rooms. Because of the lockdown, we are working with limited services. To ensure our guests are comfortable, we are keeping in touch with them on WhatsApp. If they need anything, they alert us on WhatsApp,” she said.About 200 rooms at the Le Meridian hotel, 200 at Sheraton and 250 at Vivanta by Taj in Dwarka, have been reserved for the purpose, besides rooms at Red Fox and IBIS in Aerocity, Welcome Hotel by ITC and Red Fox in Mayur Vihar Phase 1. Rooms are being offered for prices between Rs 2,000 plus taxes and Rs 4,800 plus taxes, depending on the overall rating of the hotel and the choice of room (single or double bed).Sylvain Laroche, director of operation, Ibis & Ibis styles India said, the team at ibis hotel in Aerocity received 34 guests for quarantining on Friday. “While we continue to maintain the same structure with separate entry & exits paths, food served in takeaway boxes and delivered outside their rooms, we are also implementing new ideas like sharing the menu on their TV screens with no physical contact. As done in the past, the hotel team will be in touch with the guests via calls to check on them and ensure that their stay is made as comfortable as possible,” Laroche said. “We will be serving Indian/Chinese/Western vegetarian meals. In case there are any requests from these guests, we will look into it,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-social-distancing-aboard-plane-long-wait-with-little-food-say-passengers-of-first-evacuation-flight-to-capital/story-0y8PQvGDH4SPDl1cnFHS8J.html
09-05-2020||Delhi||1,200 migrants leave for Bihar on 2nd special train from Delhi||Around 1,200 stranded migrants — men, women and children — left for their homes in Bihar from the New Delhi Railway station in a second special train arranged by the Delhi government on Friday afternoon.The train, senior government officials said, was headed to Muzaffarpur in Bihar, where it is likely to reach by Saturday evening. It will travel non-stop.The first such train had left Delhi on Thursday, taking 1,075 stranded migrants back to Madhya Pradesh. In both cases, the Central government paid 85% of the ticket price. The remaining was paid by the destination state (Madhya Pradesh) in case of the first train, and the origin state (Delhi) for the second train, a senior Delhi government official said.In the next couple of days, more such special trains are likely to leave for Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.“The future is uncertain,” said Jai Kishan, a 20-year-old daily wager from Bihar’s Arah. Asked why he wanted to return home when the government had eased the lockdown and allowed people from certain sectors to restart working, he said, “I have to go home to see my mother and three sisters. I am the only breadwinner of the family… I have not been able to send money and they have run out of whatever savings they had. Right now, I can’t think of anything else.” Back in the village, he said, he has a small patch of land for farming. It is the time of harvest and he was anyway supposed to go home at this time, but had been stranded due to the lockdown. “I will think of other livelihood alternatives later… I don’t feel like coming back but, if need be, I will have to come again,” said Kishan, wiping his forehead with his scarf as the high temperature on Friday contributed to the discomfort for the travellers. But, most of them said that now that they were headed home, nothing bothered them any longer. Mohammad Amir, 29, who was a mason in a factory till recently, said the last one-and-a-half months have been very tough on him. “Earlier, we used to earn and have our meals with dignity. Here at the shelters, food is distributed to us like we are prisoners… I won’t come back now.” When the news broke about Friday’s train to Bihar, scores of migrants rushed to the station to get reservations done. However, they returned disappointed later on learning that it was under a state arrangement and one had to apply for the process. The news was circulated widely on WhatsApp which give them hope, said several migrants whom HT met at the New Delhi Railway station on Friday.Around 10,000 stranded migrants in Delhi, out of around 18,000 who are currently staying in shelters and temporary government-run centres are learnt to have applied under the government initiative that aims to enable inter-state movement of stranded people through buses and trains as per Union home ministry guidelinesA senior government official said, a large number of migrants decided to stay back, as of now, in the light of industrial and construction activities restarting to some extent this week .Delhi is also in talks with other states that include Rajasthan, West Bengal, Jharkhand and Odisha, the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/relieved-say-migrants-as-second-special-train-to-bihar-chugs-out/story-0e46oh4IfU9J74fSAG4CCM.html
09-05-2020||Delhi||As MHRD announces new dates for CBSE exams, Sisodia says Delhi wasn’t consulted||While the Union ministry of human resources development (HRD) on Friday announced that the pending Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) class 10 and 12 examinations would be conducted between July 1 and July 15, Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia said the government was not consulted before the dates were announced, even as Delhi has the most papers pending across the country.Delhi had earlier requested the HRD ministry to cancel the remaining CBSE class 10 and 12 exams, saying it was unfeasible to conduct them under the prevailing circumstances. Sisodia had also asked the ministry to pass students on the basis of their marks in internal examinations.Schools across the country have been shut since the end of March, owing to the nationwide lockdown in place to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). All schools in the national capital were shut even earlier, from March 19. After HRD minister Ramesh Pokhriyal’s announced the new dates on Friday, Sisodia told HT, “I don’t think it’s a good idea. I had already suggested that the MHRD cancel the exams. It’s unfortunate that they have not even consulted us before taking a decision.”The maximum number of pending papers will be held in northeast Delhi, where exams were curtailed due to the communal riots in the last week of February. Exams for the entire country were postponed on March 19, due to the Covid-19 pandemic. While the exams for 12 subjects of class 12 will be held across the country, the exams for class 10 will be held only in northeast Delhi. Overall, the CBSE will conduct 27 exams.A Union government official said that while the board and HRD ministry are keen that exams be held, the situation is an evolving one and will continue to be monitored.Significantly, while the HRD ministry and CBSE are hoping to get the exams conducted in July, there have been studies which point out that COVID-19 may not thaw completely by that time.Sisodia, however, said that AIIMS Delhi director Dr Randeep Guleria had recently suggested there can be a possible peak in the Covid-19 curve in the city in June and July. “It’s still difficult to ascertain that what the situation in June and July will be,” he said.Meanwhile, principals of schools said that at least there is a clarity about the exams. “It’s a relief for students as well as for us. The kind of uncertainty we had in mind has gone. However, the CBSE has to come up with proper plan to conduct exams taking all precautions,” said Jyoti Arora, principal of Mount Abu School in Rohini. The school is also a CBSE examination centre.Arsh Malik, a class 12 student at a government school in northeast Delhi’s Yamuna Vihar, said, “We were not feeling like studying till now because there was no clarity over dates. Now at least we can study with focus.”Many parents, however, expressed concerns over the move. “It’s going to be very risky to send our children for exams in the prevailing situation. We just hope things get better by July. There is already speculation of the peak in Covid-19 cases in July in Delhi,” said Mahima Khurana, mother of a class 12 student.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/as-mhrd-announces-new-dates-for-cbse-exams-sisodia-says-delhi-wasn-t-consulted/story-Ml7TOcFjF0OUg5xO7Ty8VI.html
09-05-2020||Chandigarh||Gangster with Pakistan link among seven held with cache of arms in Kapurthala||In a major breakthrough, the Punjab Police have arrested most wanted gangster and drug smuggler Baljinder Singh Billa Mandiala and his six accomplices from Kapurthala district with a large consignment of highly sophisticated weapons smuggled from Pakistan.Billa Mandiala had close links with the now dead Pakistan-based Khalistan Liberation Force (KLF) chief Harmeet Singh Happy. The police also recovered Rs 3 lakh drug money from the gang that reportedly smuggled consignments from Pakistan at different times through several modes, including drones.Director general of police (DGP) Dinkar Gupta said the arrests were made in a joint operation by the Organised Crime Control Unit (OCCU) team from Chandigarh, counter-intelligence Jalandhar unit and Kapurthala police on Thursday evening. The accused were nabbed in Dadwindi and Mothanwala area under Sultanpur Lodhi police station. Billa, who hails from Mandiala village of Gurdaspur, has been a notorious drug smuggler, but it has now emerged that he had been involved in supply of arms for past few years.During preliminary investigations, Billa Mandiala has revealed that he was in contact with various Pakistan-based weapon and drug smugglers, including Mirza and Ahmdeen, and had already received many consignments of weapons and drugs from them, mostly in the Ferozepur area. Mirza was allegedly working as courier on Indo-Pak border for operatives of KLF.Others arrested in the operation included Sukhjinder Singh from Kamoke village of Amritsar, Kapurthala-based Mohit Sharma, Lovepreet Singh, Mangal Singh, Maninderjeet Singh Happy and Lovepreet Lovely of Amarkot village in Tarn Taran. Billa Mandiala was wanted in more than 18 criminal cases, including those of murder, attempt to murder and smuggling of weapons/drugs.All the accused have been kept separately as they are being tested for Covid-19 by a special team of doctors, police said.THE RECOVERYThe DGP said the police have recovered highly sophisticated arms and ammunition smuggled from Pakistan, from the accused.These include two 30-bore drum machine guns, three pistols (Sig Sauer made in Germany), two Glock pistols (made in Austria), two 30 bore pistols, one 32 bore pistol, one .315 bore rifle and 341 live cartridges. Besides, over Rs 3 lakh and 100 Australian dollars were recovered from them. Terming it as one of the biggest caches of highly sophisticated weapons from a criminal gang, Gupta said Sig Suaer pistols are used by members of US Secret Service. The police are investigating the role of militants in the supply chain of illegal weapons from Pakistan. A case has been registered against all the accused under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and the Arms Act at police station Sultanpur Lodhi, Kapurthala.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gangster-with-pakistan-link-among-seven-held-with-cache-of-arms-in-kapurthala/story-Y336KHPTcwtQc3LZKUnurL.html
09-05-2020||Chandigarh||Over 130 Haryana, Punjab illegal migrants in US to be deported soon||Nearly 160 illegal Indian immigrants, including 132 from Haryana and Punjab, will be deported from the United States in the coming few days. The US authorities have communicated the details of 161 Indian detainees to New Delhi for deportation following the initiation of air evacuation operations for stranded Indian nationals due to the Covid-19 situation. These details were shared by the ministry of external affairs (MEA) with the states following a recent meeting between foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla and the top brass of Haryana and Punjab governments, top officials said.Officials who did not wish to get quoted said that there are 76 illegal migrants from Haryana and 56 from Punjab who are in the custody of the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) at detention centres in Texas, Arizona, California, New York and Washington, and being readied for deportation. The ICE air operations, the air transportation arm of the US agency, facilitates the removal of aliens to destinations worldwide using air charter services.A ministry of external affairs (MEA) official authorised to answer media queries said the illegal migrants will be flown in by the US authorities. “Though the transportation of deportees is not part of the evacuation operation to bring stranded Indians back from abroad, the MEA is making all necessary arrangements, including documentation, for the arrival of deportees. The deportees will be put at the disposal of the respective state governments after their arrival and will have to undergo 14-day mandatory quarantine,” MEA’s press relation officer said. WHITE HOUSE ORDER ON REPATRIATION OF FOREIGNERSThe hastened deportation process is clearly the outcome of an April 10 executive order of US president, Donald Trump imposing visa sanctions on countries that deny or unreasonably delay the acceptance of aliens who are their citizens, subjects, nationals, or residents after being asked to accept those aliens from the United States during the Covid-19 pandemic. Such an action, the executive order said, created unacceptable public health risks for Americans. “The United States must be able to effectuate the repatriation of foreign nationals who violate the laws of the United States,” said the presidential order which will cease to apply on December 31, unless extended. The presidential order would apply to illegal migrants also, officials said.The US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) had earlier in March evaluated its detained population for high-risk cases to determine whether their continued detention was appropriate. Of this medical risk population, ICE released over 900 individuals after evaluating their immigration history, criminal record, potential threat to public safety, flight risk, and national security concerns. ICE’s detained population has also steadily dropped by more than 7,000 individuals since March 1, 2020 as a result of the decrease in book-ins compared to this time last year, combined with continued repatriations of illegal aliens, as per a statement issued by ICE. INDIA DETAINEES CROSSED OVER FROM SOUTHERN BORDERStatistics show that 92 Indian migrants were detained by US Customs and Border Protection personnel in Texas after making illegal crossovers from the southern border abutting Mexico. There were 21 detentions in New York, 22 in Atlanta and 22 in San Francisco. Oregon-based immigrant rights activist, Navneet Kaur who often works as an interpreter for the Indian detainees said that most of the asylum pleas of Indian detainees have been rejected in the past one year. “I have heard about only one positive outcome,” Kaur said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/over-130-haryana-punjab-illegal-migrants-in-us-to-be-deported-soon/story-iEtjooLzWEaq2incpGvbkO.html

Sagar Khaladkar is a coach at the Abhijeet Kadam kabaddi association in Kothrud and his student-athlete Siddharth Limhan is also appearing for the police recruitment test. Limhan believes there are many students who cannot afford classes due to high fees and is, therefore, sharing his proficiency in maths and general mental ability with other students. “We decided to give them a free of cost guidance. Khaladkar sir gave an idea and now it is benefitting to me as well. As I am teaching these students, it is also helping me revise the topics,” Limhan said.Limhan conducts maths classes thrice a week and focuses on general mental ability on other days. Khaladkar conducts fitness classes every day in the evening.“In one batch there are 15-20 students. It is a 1-hour class, and then I give them homework. There are many who don’t have proper internet and cannot join the class, so I provide them with notes over WhatsApp,” added Limhan. Khaladkar and Limhan have received a good response for this initiative and now they are planning to continue these classes even after the lockdown is over.“I have seen students who are eager to learn but could not go to classes, so we have decided, to help the needy students,” added Limhan.Khaladkar, has trained students since 2006, has always helped players in academics along with sports.“Job security is very important and players who are playing kabaddi mostly don’t have financial stability at home so I always tell them to focus on government jobs,” Khaladkar said.Many women players of the Dr Patangrao Kadam kabaddi team and players from Raigad district and Mumbai are also joining the sessions.Khaladkar posts updates on his sessions through Facebook which has given the duo a lot of traction. “Many times, we conduct conference calls and arrange various sessions from dietitians and even some players, who are now police sub-inspectors,” Khaladkar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kabaddi-coach-athlete-turn-tutors-for-the-needy/story-uRxX1INKTGlA4hT9SG2oXJ.html

09-05-2020||Pune||Implement 2008 law for unorganiser workers, says activist BJ Kerkar||In order to meet the challenges faced by labourers in the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, city-based labour activist B J Kerkar has demanded the implementation of the Unorganised workers’ social security act of 2008. The act passed during former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s era mandated benefits for unorganised labour, mostly women, such as social securities, national minimum wage, and a smart identity card.“Our all India movement had demanded that each of the unorganised worker be provided with a smart card for identity, so that benefits could reach them whenever and wherever they may be working. Even that too has not seen the light of day till now,” Kerkar said.The 85-year old is the vice president of the Maharashtra state sarva shramik mahasangh and the general secretary of Insurers pensions association. Kerkar who has spent his life crusading for the empowerment and justice of the working class said it was high time that the provisions of the law for the welfare of unorganised labour were implemented, especially in these times of distress due to the Covid-19 pandemic. He noted that the legislation was passed by the Indian parliament in 2008 and much credit was due to the Arjun Sengupta commission for attempting to bring the unorganised sector of the economy into the mainstream.According to Kerkar, the commission had recommended technological, credit and marketing support for this sector and if accomplished, it would go to a great extent in solving the country’s major problems, like unemployment, backwardness and poverty.Kerkar regretted that there had been no implementation of the recommendations so far.The veteran labour activist said the central government had proposed a labour code for social securities which has been referred to a standing committee of parliament and has been pending since 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/implement-2008-law-for-unorganiser-workers-says-activist-kerkar/story-D9OXn3N1Iq21uA7p9V6bgO.html

09-05-2020||Pune||Almost all clinics, hospitals open in Pune despite obstacles, IMA writes to PMC||Indian Medical Association (IMA), Pune chapter, has written to Pune municipal commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad that almost all clinics and hospitals in Pune are open in spite of many obstacles.The IMA letter dated May 7 was issued after several private doctors protested about the notices received by them from the PMC warning stern action if their clinics were found to be shut during regular hours.The notices issued by Gaikwad said that the civic body had observed that many private hospitals and dispensaries were being kept closed. The commissioner ordered these hospitals and clinics to function normally failing which PMC would be forced to file an FIR (first information report) under section 188 of Indian Penal Code, 1860, the notices said.“Many members have expressed their anguish to IMA Pune about such notice without verification and the language used from your side. In fact, we expect some good words about these doctors practising for the cause,” the IMA letter signed by the chairman of its Pune action committee, Dr Aarti Nimkar, president and secretaries, Dr Rajan Sancheti and Dr Sunil Ingale said.While appreciating the hard work put in by the PMC to control the Covid-19 pandemic, the letter said that IMA Pune was also trying to contribute by keeping all clinics and hospitals running as per the civic body’s instructions.The IMA said that it tried to join PMC flu clinics, but had problems with coordination. They were, therefore, running at least three to four mobile clinics daily for needy people along with the Bharatiya Jain Sanghatana (BJS).A helpline for people in need of medical consultation was also launched, the letter saidThe IMA said that during a meeting at the PMC on May 4, it was decided that personal protective equipment (PPE) would be supplied to private doctors by the PMC, but there was no progress on this assurance.There was also no progress on the District Coordination Committee that was supposed to be established in association with the IMA, as per the directives from the central government, the letter said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/almost-all-clinics-hospitals-open-despite-obstacles-ima-writes-to-pmc/story-tyA8DouXAsC0ssfcmE9K9M.html

The driver, 43-year-old Udayraj (identified by his first name only), abandoned the car and fled the spot, but the police apprehended him later. The public thrashed his friend, Rajeev (identified by his first name only), who was in the car, before the police could rescue him. “Rajeev, who works at a footwear manufacturing unit, was drunk. The car driver, however, was sober,” a police officer said.The family members of one of the dead boys are daily wage labourers. “His parents are so poor that they don’t have money to even buy food, let alone arrange an ambulance or any other vehicle to take his body to the burial ground. The local police took his body for burial in their emergency response vehicle (ERV) and pooled in money to provide the family with ration to help them for a few weeks,” DCP Koan said.The other boy lived with his family in the Lekhram Park neighbourhood of Mundka, the same area where his friend lived.“Around 3.30pm on Wednesday, the two boys were playing on the street in Murga Market near their home when a speeding Maruti Celerio car ran over the boys. A meat seller, Mahesh, who was near his shop at that time ran to save the boys, but he also ended up getting mowed down by the car,” another investigator said.The police said the car juddered to a stop and Udayraj abandoned his vehicle and friend to escape from the scene. He left an allegedly inebriated Rajeev behind.The three victims, meanwhile, were rushed to a hospital, but they couldn’t be saved.At Rajeev’s instance, the police were able to arrest Udayraj. “The duo had driven into Delhi from Bahadurgarh via an offbeat road. They were found to have flouted lockdown rules and have been booked under the Indian Penal Code Section 188 (disobedience to order promulgated by a government servant),” the officer said.Udayraj, meanwhile, has additionally been booked for causing death due to negligence and rash driving, the DCP said. He runs a factory and lives in the nearby Geetanjali Enclave.While the families of one of the boys and Mahesh were able to cremate them, the second boy’s family had to approach the police for help. “Apart from providing them with our ERV to take his body to the burial ground, the local police also pooled in ₹7,000 for their ration. We have also promised to pay their rent in the coming months,” Surendra Sandhu, station house officer of Mundka police station, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/speeding-car-kills-two-boys-meat-seller-who-tried-to-rescue-them/story-KNAN2mCYlfKRq5l06Xi0WP.html

She spent 21 days in the hospital and will now have to quarantine herself for another 14 days before joining duty.After being discharged from the hospital, the SI expressed gratitude towards the police department, her senior officers, and especially chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh, who contacted her through a video call and encouraged her during her hospital stay.Her father, Gurmeet Singh, showered flowers on the doctors who treated her.Kaur said she was confident she will beat the virus. “When I tested positive for coronavirus, I was more worried about my family and friends. Thankfully, no one, except my driver assistant sub-inspector Sukhdev Singh tested positive. He has also recovered now.”Additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP, PBI) Sachin Gupta, who reached the hospital to welcome Kaur, said the woman officer was a warrior. “She did not only keep herself enthused during treatment, but also motivated people by releasing a video and asking them not to be afraid of the virus and to take necessary precautions.”‘READ BOOKS, EXERCISED’About her time in the isolation ward, Kaur said she had not talked to her family members and friends as much in five years as she did during her 21-day stay at the hospital. “I exercised, read books and played ludo online with my friends to pass time in the hospital.

The first and second year students will be promoted to the next academic year. While Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) has welcomed the decision, college principals in the city choose to differ.Prof Nitin Karmalkar, SPPU vice-chancellor, said, “We will be conveying to our students about today’s decision announced by the honourable minister about the university exams to be held in July. All queries and issues of students related to exams will be addressed. We are also taking steps to counsel students as we are going through a crisis situation and all necessary information will be provided to them. District-wise arrangements will be done from our side for students. An action plan for exams will soon be prepared and declared by the varsity.”Ravindrasinh Pardeshi, principal, Fergusson College, said, “Today’s decision taken by the state government is good looking at the current crisis situation and it is according to the recommendations given by the University Grants Commission (UGC). We are planning for exams as per social distancing and precautionary norms. Exam halls that accommodated 50 students will now have seats for 25. Answer sheets and papers given to students will be sanitised. All these arrangements will be planned in our subsequent meetings.”Sanjay Kharat, principal , Modern College of Arts, Commerce and Science at Ganeshkhind, said, “After the announcement of exams to be held in July this year for the last year students, it is necessary for the university to start the implementation process. It is the first time in the history that students are going to be promoted for undergraduate courses. Once a student gets graduated there is a transcript of that student and if promoted is written on it then it reflects adversely on his/her career.”Anwar Shaikh, principal of Anjuman E Khairul Islam ‘s Poona College of Arts, Commerce and Science said, “We are a highly populated country and promoting students directly to next year is beneficial for some and not for others. I am getting calls from students demanding that even third year exams should have been cancelled. It means students are not willing to study and just want to get promoted. And students who are sincere about studies and career are disappointed. Exams should have been conducted for all the years in some format by taking precautions looking at the current situation.”Student groups have also welcomed the decision. Kuldeep Ambekar, president, Students Helping Hand, said, “Today’s decision announced by the education minister to promote the first and second year students is appreciated, but educational institutes to return the exam fees already collected from students. Clarity should also be made regarding students who have backlog subject or have failed in first or second year.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/state-government-s-decision-to-promote-students-evokes-mixed-reaction/story-ndxb8ymhaRnzUVqT2Paz4K.html
09-05-2020||City||Bring migrants back with better incentives, salaries and guaranteed accommodation, say HT Chandigarh readers||Clear all their dues and salariesThe migrants are suffering tremendously due to the Covid-19 lockdown. In order to help them, everyone, especially the industrialists and administrations, have to ensure that all their dues and salaries, even for days not worked, are cleared. Any medical or financial help needed by them should be provided. They should also be tested for Covid-19 free of cost and leave for treatment should be with pay.Saikrit GulatiLet large-hearted Punjabis show others the wayAll administrations at various levels in different states and union territories should draw up a comprehensive master plan of paying bonuses to all daily wage/migrant workers to secure their future. Funds for their welfare should be spent from the Prime Minister’s Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations Fund (PM CARES Fund) especially created for controlling Covid-19 in India. Farmers and industrialists should come forward voluntarily to contribute to the fund. This would be real acknowledgment of the services provided by these daily wage/migrant workers to the farming or industrial sectors. In this respect, people of the state of Punjab, famed for their proverbial magnanimity, must come forward with a large-hearted initiative to show the way to the industrialists and the administrations. This would be a valuable lesson in national unity, humaneness, and social camaraderie.DR SS Bhatti, ChandigarhMake poor aware of welfare schemesThe government should ensure that industries offer full wages to labourers to enable them to provide food and shelter to their families. The poor should be made aware of the benefits they can enjoy under various welfare schemes. To sum up, no migrant should go to bed hungry without a roof over his or her head in a welfare state.Usha Verma, ChandigarhMajor stimulus package neededSteps by farmers, industrialists, local administration to secure the future of migrants and daily wage workers will yield little without a major stimulus package by the government to protect their interests and that of their employers. Prioritising halting of the exodus and workers’ return and rehabilitation can salvage the situation.Lalit Bharadwaj, PanchkulaMandatory savings a mustThe migrant story has been one of the biggest learnings of the Covid-19 pandemic. These are the people who build our cities, huge structures, keep our economy growing. Their lot has been the worst. The onus is now on the governments to ensure not just a minimum wage of more than Rs 20,000 for them, but also make sure the people hiring them guarantee the education of their children and provide them accommodation with adequate cooling, ventilation and hygiene. Most of them should be given financial advice and asked to put their savings in a bank mandatorily. Educating each worker to not have more children will also ensure population control. After one project finishes the contractor hiring them will also have to guarantee them work in other projects.TejeshwarProvide them with work and foodThe government should make every effort to ensure the workers stay put where they are and ensure their employers provide them work and food. Full salaries should also be paid to them during the entire duration of the lockdown. Industrialists, farmers and contractors, who hire them for work, should look after them like their own family members for these people have supported them when they needed them. Giving them advance payment, or a loan or gift to go back home or survive in this lean period can also help.Sumesh Kumar Badhwar, MohaliSupports for migrants vitalThe first priority of the government should be to instil confidence in the migrants and daily wage workers by effectively supporting and feeding them till the return of normalcy, and persuade them to stay wherever they are. Focus must be on restarting construction and transportation activities, giving a fillip to industrial growth, and other miscellaneous services to ensure they get jobs.SC Luthra, ChandigarhComplete exodus will lead to catastropheA complete exodus of migrants will lead to catastrophe that will have a rippling effect on the entire economy of the nation. Their movement out of towns and cities spells total failure of the Central government in taking care of their needs. An exercise to make an estimate of their needs before the lockdown would have worked out. It can be done now.DP GautamWelfare of workers crucialThe government’s orders that migrants have to be housed within industrial premises if they are called in to work should be followed strictly with regular checks by authorities. Sanitised, cool rooms, clean toilets, bedding, hygienic food, every possible comfort for the workers should be ensured by the industrialists. The moneyed have no problems splurging on expensive cars and homes, so feeding the people who labour for them, making sure they are comfortable, should not be a problem. In fact, the industrialists should be proud to help improve the lifestyles of these people. They should also set aside certain percentages from their profits for their welfare.Richa Khullar, ChandigarhGuarantee workers’ right to a dignified lifeThe migrants and daily wage workers have to be treated with trust and compassion and for that the government must embrace the new “politics of responsibility,” guaranteeing their safe and healthy survival and an economically secure future. They have remained at the socio-economic margins of our society, silently supporting urban economies and languishing in invisibility. This crisis has made them visible so the time is ripe for the state to exercise its true responsibility of guaranteeing their right to a dignified life. To devise policies and provide services for seasonal migrant workers, the state needs to have a realistic statistical account of their number and an understanding of the nature of their mobility. The challenges are still complex and have to be fully addressed. They have to be provided work security, income and health facilities as well as clean and comfortable shelter. Pension policies also have to be created for them. Unless we view migrant workers as a dynamic part of a changing India, we will not be able to solve the problem of urbanisation.Vijay Malia, ChandigarhSocial security, good income should be prioritisedThe trauma that the migrants and daily wage labourers are going through is tragic. They have been left in the lurch and not given any priority. I don’t think it will be an easy task to get them back to work outside their home states in the near future. The nightmarish experiences during lockdown, including abrupt loss of livelihood, will haunt them for a very long time. The first priority of their employers and administration should be to win over their confidence. Guaranteed social security, good income and boarding and lodging arrangements will perhaps persuade them to come back.Paramjeet Singh, ZirakpurEnsuring their safe return can help tooMigrant labour is the lifeline of all industrial and agriculture activity, but due to Covid-19 everything is under lockdown, which has created problems for the labour force and left them without any financial means. People who hire them and Central and state governments should ensure they are provided all necessities. If they want to go home then their train and bus tickets should be paid for to ensure they return safely. Enough incentives should be given to them after the lockdown is over and the Covid-19 spread is controlled to ensure they will be able to secure their future and will find it worth their while to return to the cities.Avinash Goyal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bring-migrants-back-with-better-incentives-salaries-and-guaranteed-accommodation-say-ht-chandigarh-readers/story-uObDrfbI2EN6AZEqFFu2CN.html

The use of the Underground and trains during the pandemic has dropped substantially in London.The plan to quarantine visitors sparked a row with the opposition Labour and critics demanding why thousands have been allowed into the UK without checks so far in previous months. The airlines industry warned of a crippling effect of the measure.Lisa Nandy, shadow foreign secretary, said she had raised the issue of quarantine five times to prevent a resurgence of cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cycle-to-work-is-new-uk-mantra-as-covid-19-toll-crosses-31-500/story-vZR1KBvfiSWF3h8WLL5qeM.html

A personal military valet to the president, who and other valets work closely with the president and the first family, had tested positive on Thursday.A personal aide to Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter and adviser, has also tested positive, according to news reports that pointed out said she has been teleworking from home and not been around the first daughter for weeks. Both Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner, a senior adviser to the president, were tested on Friday and they were both negative.Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageThe president and the vice-president are now being tested for the virus every day and the White House sought assure Americans every precaution is being taken to prevent the virus from spreading. “This is the safest place you can come to,” White House chief of staff Mark Meadows told reporters.The White House has sad that every staff member working in close proximity to the president and the vice-president is being tested daily, in addition to the enforcement of social distancing, daily temperature checks and symptom histories, and the use of hand sanitizers and regular deep cleaning of all work spaces.Nearly 1.3 million people have contracted the coronavirus in the the United States with 26,960 new infections in the last 24 hours only and the 77,180 hav died of it, up by 1,518.President Trump is optimistic it will be over soon. He told reporters at a meeting with Republican lawmakers that the virus “This is going to go away without a vaccine. It’s going to go away, and it’s -- we’re not going to see it again, hopefully, after a period of time.”“You may have some -- some flare-ups and I guess, you know, I would expect that,” he added. “Sometime in the fall, you’ll have flare-ups maybe.”The American president has previously said a vaccine is likely by the end of the year, though medical experts on his coronavirus task force have been a little more circumspect and suggested January or later.But the president’s optimism is in line with his earlier remarks that the epidemic will be gone like a “miracle”, which were attributed initially to his reluctance to acknowledge the gravity of the crisis and, then, once he finally did, with mounting infections and fatalities, his eagerness to reopen the country.The infections at the White House, have however, raised questions about the workplace safety around the country as businesses reopen. The White House may have added to these uncertainties by blocking the release of reopening guidelines put together by the government’s top medical experts.(For print) And amid rising tensions with China on the coronavirus outbreak, the United States on Friday cut visa period for Chinese journalists to 90 days, with the option of extending it. The two countries have been engaged in a series of retaliatory actions against journalists in recent months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/second-white-house-covid-19-infection-raises-questions-about-workplace-safety/story-JcQfksNLIUX3WwE2b8tXfM.html
09-05-2020||World||After months of no checks, UK mulls quarantine for visitors||A row erupted on Saturday after it was revealed that the Boris Johnson government is considering quarantining all visitors for 14 days from May-end, with the opposition Labour and critics demanding why thousands have been allowed in without checks so far.The airlines industry warned of a debilitating effect of the measure. Ministers and health officials previously claimed checking and quarantining visitors had a marginal effect, but the new plan led many to demand why now, after over 31,000 people have died in the UK.Under the plan, people who arrive at airports, ports and Eurostar railway stations will be asked to provide the address they will self-isolate for two weeks upon arrival by filling out a digital form. Those from Ireland, Channel Islands and the Isle of Man are to be exempted.Lisa Nandy, shadow foreign secretary, said she had raised the issue of quarantine five times to prevent a resurgence of cases. Tens of thousands of people on flights from China and elsewhere have arrived in the past three months, without checks or quarantine.Johnson is due to announce “modest” relaxation in lockdown measures on Sunday evening, but leaks in the British media suggest quarantine is one of the measures being considered to prevent a second peak of coronavirus. According to Johnson, the UK is past its first peak.Bodies representing airlines awaited details of the quarantine plan, but Airlines UK said: “This proposal would effectively kill international travel to and from the UK and cause immeasurable damage to the aviation industry and wider UK economy”.“Nobody is going to go on holiday if they’re not able to resume normal life for 14 days, and business travel would be severely restricted. It will also make it all but impossible for aviation to resume any time soon, thereby setting back the UK’s economic recovery still further.”Karen Dee of the Airport Operators Association, said the plan would “not only have a devastating impact on the UK aviation industry, but also on the wider economy…There should be a clear exit strategy and the economic impact on key sectors should be mitigated”.The number of virus-stricken patients in hospitals has been dwindling in recent days, particularly in the worst affected area of London. The dead include a six-week-old baby and 614 people categorised as ‘British Indian’ by NHS England.---||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-months-of-no-checks-uk-mulls-quarantine-for-visitors/story-TLrwhp1hVWL8BEzMo2TlZL.html
09-05-2020||World||Britain to quarantine travellers for 14 days, UK airlines association says||The British government has told airlines it will introduce a 14-day quarantine period for most people arriving from abroad to try to avoid a second peak of the coronavirus pandemic, an association representing the airlines said on Saturday.Airlines UK, which represents British Airways, Easyjet and other British airlines, said the move required “a credible exit plan” and should be reviewed weekly. Airport operators said it could have a “devastating” impact on the aviation industry and the broader economy.The quarantine plan was first reported by The Times newspaper, which said Prime Minister Boris Johnson would on Sunday announce that passengers arriving at airports and ports, including Britons returning from abroad, will have to self-isolate for a fortnight.Under measures that are likely to come into force in early June, travellers will have to provide the address at which they will self-isolate on arrival, The Times said.“These measures will help protect the British public and reduce the transmission of the virus as we move into the next phase of our response,” The Times quoted a government source as saying.Johnson’s Downing Street office and the interior ministry declined comment. Johnson is due on Sunday to announce the next steps in Britain’s battle to tackle the novel coronavirus following a review by ministers of measures that have all but shut the economy and kept millions at home for more than six weeks.The airport operators said a quarantine would compound damage done by the pandemic to the aviation industry as it would put people off travelling when lockdown restrictions are lifted.“Quarantine would not only have a devastating impact on the UK aviation industry, but also on the wider economy,” said Karen Dee, Chief Executive of the Airport Operators Association.“If the government believes quarantine is medically necessary, then it should be applied on a selective basis following the science, there should be a clear exit strategy and the economic impact on key sectors should be mitigated.”SPOT CHECKS AND FINESAirlines UK said it would seek assurances that the move is “led by the science” and that airlines would need support measures to ensure the aviation sector gets through the quarantine period. The Times report said travellers from Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man would be exempt from the quarantine, as would lorry drivers bringing crucial supplies.It said the authorities would carry out spot checks and those found to be breaking the rules would face fines or deportation.Britain has reported 31,241 deaths from the coronavirus and environment minister George Eustice said Johnson would not announce any dramatic changes to Britain’s lockdown on Sunday.The devolved Welsh government announced minor lockdown adjustments on Friday, allowing people to exercise more than once a day and garden centres to reopen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-to-quarantine-travellers-for-14-days-uk-airlines-association-says/story-3BVUVf44xBSsqTA3ctapsJ.html
09-05-2020||World||China admits coronavirus exposed ‘shortcomings’ in healthcare system||The coronavirus outbreak exposed “shortcomings” in China’s public healthcare system, a top health official admitted Saturday, saying that reforms are underway to improve the country’s disease prevention and control mechanisms.China has faced criticism both at home and abroad for downplaying the virus and concealing information about the outbreak when it first emerged in the central city of Wuhan in December.The virus has since infected nearly four million people worldwide -- claiming more than 270,000 lives -- and crippled the global economy.Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageBeijing has insisted it has always shared information with the World Health Organization and other countries in a timely manner.But on Saturday Li Bin, deputy director of China’s National Health Commission, made a rare admission when he said the healthcare system had not been adequately prepared, which had left holes in China’s response.“The novel coronavirus outbreak was a big test that revealed China still has shortcomings in its major epidemic prevention and control system, public health systems and other aspects of responding (to an emergency),” Li told reporters at a press briefing.China’s health authority will build a “centralised, unified and efficient” leadership system that would allow it to respond more quickly and effectively to any public health crisis in the future, Li said.Officials were also discussing how to “modernise” the disease control and prevention system by using big data, artificial intelligence, cloud computing and other technologies that will help to predict outbreaks more accurately and enhance preparedness, Li said. The commission was also considering ways to revise public health laws, strengthen international exchanges and “actively participate in global health governance,” Li added.On Friday Beijing said it would support a World Health Organization-led review into the global response to the coronavirus outbreak -- once the pandemic is over.The comments came after US President Donald Trump ramped up criticism of China this week, saying the virus “could have been stopped in China.”Although it was the first epicentre of the pandemic, China has not reported any coronavirus related deaths for 24 consecutive days, and the country is gradually reopening schools and urging workers to return to work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-admits-coronavirus-exposed-shortcomings-in-healthcare-system/story-XJDrA7gWjzPz2MKmUuz7hI.html

The Army on Friday said in a statement that a vehicle of paramilitary Frontier Corps was targeted through a remote-controlled improvised explosive device (IED) in Kech district’s Buleda area, about 14 km from the Iran border.“A major and five soldiers were killed while one soldier was injured,” according to the Army.No one took responsibility but Baloch militants often target the security forces in the province.Security sources said the route where the explosion took place was monitored round the clock because of suspected movement by smugglers and insurgents in the border area.A search operation was launched by the security forces in the area to trace the elements involved in the attack.It is the first major attack on the forces in Balochistan since the outbreak of Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-army-major-among-6-security-personnel-killed-in-roadside-bomb-attack/story-rzDRhiPICnTLYCPgcz2yyI.html
09-05-2020||World||Covid-19 crisis fuels historic US job losses, Europe wants borders kept shut||The United States recorded its steepest job losses in history over the coronavirus pandemic as Europe moved to keep its borders shut for another month.Hopes have been rising that the worst of the global catastrophe, which has killed more than 270,000 people, has passed, and the United States on Friday approved a new at-home saliva test to speed up diagnosis for Covid-19.But after weeks of lockdown across the world, the effects have been painfully visible, with the global economy suffering its most acute downturn in nearly a century.In the United States, 20.5 million jobs were wiped out in April -- the most ever reported -- with unemployment rising to 14.7 percent, the highest since the Great Depression.The world’s largest economy has suffered the deadliest coronavirus outbreak, with more than 77,000 fatalities and nearly 1.3 million cases.Mindful of elections in November, President Donald Trump has nonetheless vowed to reopen the country, and a growing number of state governors have already let business resume with precautions.Trump played down the unemployment numbers, pointing to substantial gains Friday on global stock markets as proof that better times were ahead.“We’re going to have a phenomenal year next year,” Trump told reporters. “I think it’s going to come back blazing.”His optimism came even as the virus spread within the White House, with the press secretary of Vice President Mike Pence testing positive.Neighbouring Canada also shed three million jobs, bringing its unemployment rate up to 13.1 percent, two days after the European Union forecast a massive recession in the bloc.Disinfecting drones In India, drones sprayed disinfectant on the streets of Ahmedabad on Saturday, hours after security forces clashed with residents who flouted a toughened lockdown.The western city has become a coronavirus hotspot and a major concern for authorities as they battle a surge in deaths and infections.The tougher measures in India come as a number of governments around the world are moving to ease restrictions.Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, took decisive early action that stemmed the virus and Chancellor Angela Merkel plans an almost complete return to normal within the month.Italy, where deaths on Friday passed 30,000, plans to allow worshippers to return to church, while Denmark said cinemas, museums and zoos would reopen on June 8.In Britain, which has suffered the highest death toll after the United States, Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to offer a roadmap out of lockdown on Sunday.The European Commission meanwhile recommended that the 27-nation bloc extend its ban on the non-essential entry of visitors until June 15.“The situation remains fragile both in Europe and in the world,” it said in a statement.The virus that has infected 3.9 million people worldwide overshadowed one of the most important dates on the European calendar -- the anniversary of the end of World War II on the continent.Parades and commemorations to mark 75 years since Nazi Germany’s surrender were canceled or scaled down Friday.Russia, which marks the occasion a day later than western Europe, Saturday held muted celebrations after becoming Europe’s hotspot in the coronavirus pandemic.A Red Square parade was postponed and President Vladimir Putin instead gave a speech at a war memorial inside the Kremlin walls.He made no mention of the coronavirus but hinted at the struggle Russians are facing against the pandemic.“Our veterans fought for life, against death. And we will always be equal to their unity and endurance,” Putin said.No unity at UN Far from bringing the world together, the crisis has triggered a war of words between China, where the virus first appeared in the metropolis of Wuhan, and the United States, where Trump has battled criticism over his handling of the epidemic.The Trump administration has brought into the mainstream a theory that the virus came from a Wuhan laboratory, despite the World Health Organization and the top US epidemiologist saying there is no evidence.China rejects the charge, and America’s allies are not convinced.The feud spread Friday to the UN Security Council, where the US, stunning other members, prevented a vote on a resolution that called for a ceasefire in various conflicts around the world to allow governments to better address the pandemic among those suffering most.Diplomats said Washington was concerned about language in the resolution on the role of the World Health Organization, which has been at the forefront of confronting Covid-19.Trump has vowed to freeze the more than $400 million in annual US funding for the UN body, saying it did not act quickly enough when the mysterious respiratory disease emerged in Wuhan and blindly took the word of China.The US State Department on Friday also accused China and Russia of sharply escalating disinformation online about the virus, including promoting conspiracy theories that it was cooked up by US scientists.Home tests Researchers in Hong Kong have found that patients suffering milder illness caused by the coronavirus recover more quickly if they are treated with a three-drug antiviral cocktail soon after symptoms appear.Authors of the study, published in the Lancet on Friday, called for larger-scale research to ascertain if the drug combo could be a viable treatment for critically-ill patients.With the US death toll and infections still climbing, regulators on Friday offered a way to ramp up testing -- a significantly simpler home diagnostic kit that uses saliva.Public health workers warn that a complete return to normal is impossible until the development of a vaccine, which could take months if not longer.Trump, however, has suggested that a vaccine is not a prerequisite to ending the pandemic.“At some point it will probably go away by itself,” he told reporters, while adding: “If we had a vaccine, that would be very helpful.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-crisis-fuels-historic-us-job-losses-europe-wants-borders-kept-shut/story-LN05Qd44NMokGHr15gJF6K.html

09-05-2020||World||Ivanka Trump’s personal assistant tests positive for coronavirus||Ivanka Trump’s personal assistant has tested positive for the deadly coronavirus, making her the third White House staff member to be infected from Covid-19, a media report said on Saturday.The assistant, who works in a personal capacity for US President Donald Trump’s daughter, has not been around her in several weeks, the CNN reported.She has been teleworking for nearly two months and was tested out of caution, the report quoted a source as saying.She was not symptomatic. Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner both tested negative on Friday, the person familiar with the matter told the US news channel. The development comes a day after President Trump confirmed that Vice President Mike Pence’s press secretary Katie Miller had tested positive for the coronavirus.“She’s a wonderful young woman, Katie, she tested very good for a long period of time and then all of a sudden today she tested positive,” Trump said during a meeting at the White House.He said Miller had not come into contact with him but spent some time with Pence.One of Trump’s personal valets tested positive for the coronavirus on Thursday.Following the news of the valet’s illness, Trump said he would be tested for the coronavirus daily.According to a senior official, contact tracing was performed inside the White House after Miller’s test came positive.The White House is now making sure staffers wear masks in the White House residence, and coronavirus tests and temperature checks are being boosted throughout the West Wing. The West Wing is also being sanitised on a more frequent basis, the official said.Pence, who leads the White House coronavirus task force, recently went on a trip to the Mayo Clinic without wearing a face mask, despite being told about the clinic’s policy saying they’re required.Trump also declined to wear a mask this week during portions of his tour of a mask-making facility in Arizona.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ivanka-trump-s-personal-assistant-tests-positive-for-coronavirus/story-JiREHIrA0UStKqi41DGCxN.html
09-05-2020||World||Trump admin working to temporarily ban work-based visas: Report||The US is working to temporarily ban the issuance of some work-based visas like H-1B, popular among highly-skilled Indian IT professionals, as well as students visas and work authorisation that accompanies them, amidst the high level of unemployment due to the coronavirus, according to a media report on Friday.The H-1B is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers from countries like India and China in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise.Nearly 500,000 migrant workers are employed in the US in the H-1B status.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic“The president’s immigration advisers are drawing up plans for a coming executive order, expected this month, that would ban the issuance of some new temporary, work-based visas,” The Wall Street Journal reported Friday. “The order is expected to focus on visa categories including H-1B, designed for highly skilled workers, and H-2B, for seasonal migrant workers, as well as student visas and the work authorization that accompanies them,” it said. More than 33 million Americans have lost their jobs in the last two months due to the coronavirus pandemic that has brought the US economy to a standstill. The IMF and the World Bank have projected a negative growth rate for the country. White House officials say that the US economy is likely to grow at negative 15 to 20 per cent in the second quarter.The monthly jobs report on Friday said that the unemployment rate in the US for the month of April rose to 14.7 per cent. This is the highest rate and the largest over-the-month increase in the history of the series, seasonally adjusted data are available back to January 1948, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics said.As such, the Trump administration, having temporarily closed borders and curtailed immigration in response to the coronavirus pandemic, is moving to expand those restrictions while the president’s advisers push to leave them in place for months or even years to come, according to several people familiar with the matter, The Wall Street Journal reported.Last month, President Donald Trump had signed an executive order temporarily barring new immigrants for 60 days, including family members of US citizens. “The coming changes, the administration has suggested, will build on this April action,” the journal said.Given the high level of unemployment and joblessness, according to the daily, senior administration officials are operating on the assumption that the public, during the pandemic, will be willing to accept new limits on immigration.“Though the scope of the order hasn’t yet been decided, administration officials said it could range from suspensions of entire visa categories to the creation of incentives to hire Americans in industries hardest-hit by layoffs,” The Wall Street Journal reported.The Wall Street Journal report came a day after a group of four Republican Senators in a letter urged Trump to suspend all new guest worker visas for 60 days and some of its categories, including the H-1B visa, for at least the next year or until unemployment figures return to normal levels in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-admin-working-to-temporarily-ban-work-based-visas-report/story-YpWpO8s2ae3TQTpj5TtXtJ.html
09-05-2020||World||China to reform disease prevention & control system amid Covid-19 pandemic||China will reform its disease prevention and control system to address weaknesses exposed by the coronavirus outbreak, a senior health official said on Saturday.China has been criticised domestically and abroad as being initially slow to react to the epidemic, which first broke out on a large scale in Wuhan. The virus has since spread across the world, infecting almost 4 million people and killing almost a quarter-million from the Covid-19 disease it causes.“This coronavirus epidemic is a big test of our country’s governance and governing ability, and it exposed the weak links in how we address major epidemic and public health systems,” Li Bin, vice minister of the China National Health Commission, told reporters.The commission intends to build a “centralised and efficient” chain of command and reform, and modernise the disease prevention and control system, he said.The commission also aims to make better use of big data, artificial intelligence and cloud computing to better analyse the disease, trace the virus and distribute resources.He said the commission plans to step up research on core technology, improve medical insurance and better ensure the availability of emergency materials.China has not seen any new deaths from coronavirus for 24 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-reform-disease-prevention-control-system-amid-covid-19-pandemic/story-RgoPYNPQhaiOOCTWkNJH1H.html
09-05-2020||World||American lawmakers introduce legislation in Congress to offer green cards to foreign doctors, nurses||Several American lawmakers have introduced a legislation in Congress to offer the 40,000 unused green cards to thousands of foreign nurses and doctors to meet the urgent needs of the overstretched healthcare sector in the US, the worst hit nation by the coronavirus pandemic. The US has nearly 1,284,000 cases of confirmed Covid-19 cases and over 77,000 people have died due to the highly contagious disease. The Healthcare Workforce Resilience Act would allow for recapturing green cards that were approved by Congress but unused in past years, allowing thousands of additional medical professionals to serve permanently in the United States.The legislation would send green cards to 25,000 nurses and 15,000 doctors during the Covid-19 pandemic and ensure that states like Iowa have the professionals they need to serve patients for years to come, a media release said.The move is likely to benefit a large number of Indian nurses and doctors in the US, who are either on H-1B or J2 visas. The H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise. Companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China.A Green Card, known officially as a Permanent Resident Card, is a document issued to immigrants to the US as evidence that the bearer has been granted the privilege of residing permanently.In the House of Representatives, the legislation has been introduced by lawmakers Abby Finkenauer, Brad Schneider, Tom Cole and Don Bacon. The bipartisan Senate companion bill is led by Senators David Perdue, Dick Durbin, Todd Young and Chris Coons.“We need all hands on deck to address this generational crisis,” congresswoman Finkenauer said.“We know this virus will not magically disappear and experts like Dr Anthony Fauci are warning of a second wave this fall. Rural areas, which make up much of my district, remain especially vulnerable and are already experiencing a shortage of medical professionals,” she said.The act is endorsed by organisations such as the American Medical Association, the Healthcare Leadership Council, the US Chamber of Commerce, the American Association of International Healthcare Recruitment, the American Hospital Association, the American Organization for Nursing Leadership, the Bipartisan Policy Center, the America’s Essential Hospitals and the Physicians for American Healthcare Access.“Physicians fighting Covid-19 are eager to hear these words: reinforcements are on the way. Recapturing 15,000 unused immigrant visas for physicians through the Healthcare Workforce Resilience Act would ease the burden on frontline physicians, who are risking their lives in understaffed hospitals,” said Patrice A Harris, president of the American Medical Association.The American Hospital Association (AHA) and the American Organization for Nursing Leadership (AONL) said there has never been a more urgent need for the care that foreign-born physicians and foreign-trained nurses provide than during the current Covid-19 pandemic. These professionals play a critical role in ensuring the health of our communities, they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/american-lawmakers-introduce-legislation-in-congress-to-offer-green-cards-to-foreign-doctors-nurses/story-t26muI9pM45aOL19HPdyHM.html

09-05-2020||World||Covid-19: US planning to ship 8,000 ventilators abroad, says White House||President Donald Trump, who’s taken to calling the US the “king” of ventilators, is making plans to ship 8,000 of the breathing machines to foreign countries by the end of July to help in their fight against the coronavirus.That’s a long way from the early days of the virus when US medical workers were wondering if a shortage of ventilators would force them to make painful decisions about which patients would get them. Now, the US has a surplus and the president is sharing them with other countries — a goodwill gesture that also helps him offset criticism about his own early response to the pandemic.The White House did not respond to a request for specifics about how many ventilators have been sent so far, or the criteria for determining which countries will get them. But an administration official familiar with the effort provided the 8,000 figure as part of a list of actions aimed at supporting health systems abroad. The official was not authorized to discuss the projection publicly and spoke only on condition of anonymity.“We have nine factories that are throwing out ventilators at numbers that nobody can believe. There’s not been anything like that since the Second World War,” Trump said Friday.Trump said the US was giving the breathing machines to some countries. It was unclear if some nations would pay for the ventilators, which cost $5,000 to $30,000, depending on the model.“In a certain way, I’d like them to be donations. I really do. I think it’s good will,” Trump said earlier in the week. “It’s hard to say you have to pay us in order to save people from dying.” The machines shipped to other countries do not come from the national stockpile, which has about 12,000 ready to be deployed to U.S. jurisdictions. The U.S. stockpile, which is maintained by the Department of Health and Human Services, is being replenished with thousands of ventilators manufactured under the Defense Production Act.“Initially, it was very scary and we had a lot of states requesting numbers that could not be supplied,” Jared Kushner, an adviser to the president and Trump’s son-in-law, said Friday during a White House meeting with Republican members of Congress.“The president wanted to make sure that anybody in this country who needed a ventilator would get a ventilator. He saw what was happening in Italy, where people were dying in hospitals and not able to get the care they needed, and the president said ‘I don’t want that to happen in America.’” Kushner said the administration used the Defense Production Act to approve about 10 contracts with companies to make ventilators. Last year, the United States made about 30,000 ventilators, Kushner said. This year, in just a four-month period, the U.S. will make about 150,000, he said.“We’re in a place right now where we’re doing well,” Kushner said. “A lot of our allies — the countries that are friendly with America — are starting to get ventilators from us, and we have more than enough to take care of all the American citizens so it’s been a great success story.” In recent weeks, Trump has been recounting other countries’ calls for help. He said he’d offered Russia’s Vladimir Putin ventilators during a call on Thursday.“Countries know that we have tremendous amounts, tremendous volume and they’ve been calling. Nigeria just called. We’re giving them 250 ventilators. We have many countries, I’d say 12, 14 countries that called,” Trump said this week. “We’re sending quite a few to France. We’re sending quite a few to Spain and, Italy. We have four African countries.” Early last month, Trump said Britain’s Prime Minister Boris Johnson requested ventilators. A UK government spokesperson said the country’s National Health Service had ordered ventilators from manufacturers around the world, including in the U.S. In tweets, Trump has identified Ecuador, El Salvador, Honduras, Ethiopia and Indonesia as countries that have asked for ventilators.On Tuesday, Mexico said it received a U.S. shipment of 211 medical ventilators as part of aid promised by Trump. “As the saying goes, when there are hard times is when you know who your friends are,” said Foreign Secretary Marcelo Ebrard.Mexican President Andés Manuel López Obrador said Trump promised aid when he called and asked for help in obtaining 1,000 ventilators and other equipment for intensive care units. Ebrard said the shipment includes equipment made by Swiss-based Hamilton Medical.Bolivia’s right-wing interim government said President Jeanine Añez spoke with Trump last weekend and he promised $750,000 in aid to buy testing equipment and 250 ventilators “as soon as possible.” The Bolivian government said Trump expressed support for Añez and her promise to move the country toward elections.As the virus outbreak makes its way across the globe, “there are going to be resource-poor areas that need ventilators, that probably have shortages of ventilators on a good day,” said Dr. Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.Adalja said the ventilators should go to nations that have the intensive care unit doctors and respiratory therapists who understand how to operate them. Some countries don’t have such resources.“There may be some places where they need even more basic supplies than ventilators,” Adlaja said. “You want to make sure that they are being used in a place that has the capacity to use them and the training to be able to use them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-us-planning-to-ship-8-000-ventilators-abroad-says-white-house/story-fvOm7hwt05KFDhNqGt2OEP.html
09-05-2020||World||WHO readies coronavirus app for checking symptoms||The World Health Organization (WHO) plans to launch an app this month to enable people in under-resourced countries to assess whether they may have the novel coronavirus, and is considering a Bluetooth-based contact tracing feature too, an official told Reuters on Friday.The app will ask people about their symptoms and offer guidance on whether they may have Covid-19, the potentially lethal illness caused by the coronavirus, said Bernardo Mariano, chief information officer for the WHO. Other information, such as how to get tested, will be personalized according to the user’s country.Though the WHO will release a version on app stores globally, any government will be able to take the app’s underlying technology, add features and release its own version on app stores, Mariano said in a phone interview.India, Australia and the United Kingdom already have released official virus apps using their own technology, with common features including telling people whether to get tested based on their symptoms and logging people’s movements to enable more efficient contact tracing. Several countries are ramping up contact tracing, or the process of finding, testing and isolating individuals who crossed paths with an infectious individual. It is seen as vital to safely opening economies, and apps that automate parts of the process could accelerate efforts.The WHO expects its app to draw interest in other countries, including some in South America and Africa where case numbers are rising. They may lack the technology and engineers to develop apps or be struggling to offer testing and education.“The value is really for countries that do not have anything,” Mariano said. “We would be leaving behind the ones that are not able to (provide an app), that have fragile health systems.”Engineers and designers, including some who previously worked at Alphabet Inc’s Google and Microsoft Corp, have been volunteering for weeks to develop the new app with about five of them overseeing the process. They are designing it open-source on the hosting service GitHub, meaning code is open to public input. Several team members declined to comment.Mariano said he wants to include additional tools beyond the symptom checker, including a self-help guide for mental health care.The team also is considering what the WHO refers to as proximity tracing.Engineers have done preliminary work and talked to smartphone operating system makers Apple Inc and Google about possibly adopting technology the companies plan to release jointly this month to make tracing easier. The technology relies on virtual “handshakes” between phones that come within a few feet of each other for at least five minutes. Phones keep anonymised logs of such encounters, allowing someone who later tests positive to anonymously send notifications to recent contacts about their possible exposure to the virus. But Mariano said legal and privacy considerations have prevented the WHO from committing to such a feature yet. He expressed concern about the many businesses pitching proximity tools turning around and using any personal data they gather to generate revenue later.“We want to make sure we ring-fence all the risks around it,” he said. Apple and Google have said their system will not use any data for other purposes and will be stopped when the pandemic ends.The WHO plans to release guidance as soon as next week on issues countries should consider as they weigh their own proximity tracing apps.To reach people with limited internet access, the WHO is working to deliver information via text messages. In March, it launched an account on Facebook Inc’s , WhatsApp to provide users with information about the coronavirus, and it partnered with the company’s Free Basics program to make some information available without users incurring data charges.The WHO also plans to release an app next week to inform health workers globally about best practices for donning protective gear, washing hands and treating the virus. The organization already has a general app, WHO Info, that largely mirrors its website.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-readies-coronavirus-app-for-checking-symptoms/story-qI5RyBKFOcIouN4EUDd1fN.html
09-05-2020||World||‘Historic decline’: Canada loses nearly 2 million jobs amid Covid-19 crisis||Canada has recorded a historic 15.7% decline in employment since February this year and lost nearly two million jobs in April as part of the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.These details were provided by the government agency Statistics Canada or StatCan in its Labour Force Survey. As a result, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has extended a wage subsidy programme that was scheduled to last till June 6.The decline in employment since February “far exceeds” those seen in downturns in the past including the global economic meltdown in 2008-2009 and previous recessions. For April alone, the unemployment rate rose to 13%, with 1.93 million new unemployed.Also read: Anti-malaria drug fails another test as a Covid-19 treatment, says studyThe overall scenario could even be worse, as StatCan noted, “The April unemployment rate would be 17.8% when adjusted to reflect those who were not counted as unemployed for reasons specific to the Covid-19 economic shutdown.” This, it explained, was because many people wanted to return to work once their industries reopened after the forced shutdown due to Covid-19 and could not be counted among the unemployed.“In April, more than one-third (36.7%) of the potential labour force did not work or worked less than half of their usual hours, illustrating the continuing impact of the Covid-19 economic shutdown on the labour market,” StatCan added, pointing to the adverse impact of the coronavirus crisis beyond the topline numbers.Adjustments due to the disease were also reflected in the data. Nearly five million people worked from home, including 3.3 million who usually worked at a location other than their residence. StatCan stated, “The actions taken by various levels of government to protect public health amounted to an intentional shutdown of the economy which resulted in a sudden shock to the Canadian labour market.”Given the uncertainty ahead, the Canadian government has decided to extend a wage subsidy programme, which was to expire on June 6. The CA$ 73 billion initiative provides businesses, stressed by the crisis, 75% of their payroll, up to about CA $ 3500 per month per employee, in an effort to get them to retain workers. Trudeau cited the StatCan job numbers to announce that the programme will continue beyond the original end date. The extension, he said, will be necessary to “kickstart” the economy once the country returns to a degree of normalcy after the worst of the crisis has passed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-loses-nearly-2-million-jobs-witnesses-historic-decline-in-employment-amid-covid-19-crisis/story-s0he3LkvZ3tOkG8IuQju6J.html
09-05-2020||World||Pence spokeswoman, married to top Trump adviser, diagnosed with coronavirus||US Vice President Mike Pence’s press secretary, the wife of one of President Donald Trump’s senior advisers, has tested positive for the coronavirus, raising alarm about the virus’ potential spread within the White House’s inner most circle.The diagnosis of Katie Miller, who is married to White House immigration adviser and speech writer Stephen Miller, was revealed by Trump in a meeting with Republican lawmakers on Friday, a day after news that Trump’s personal valet had tested positive for the virus.“Katie, she tested very good for a long period of time and then all of a sudden today she tested positive,” Trump said, noting he himself had not been in contact with her but that she had spent time with the vice president. “I understand Mike has been tested...and he tested negative.”Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicDespite Trump’s comments, the two cases in quick succession heightened fears of contagion for the president and vice president, who are leading the US response to the pandemic, and who have both resumed travel and business schedules even as the US death toll from the virus has topped 75,000.White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany on Friday sought to defend administration efforts to protect Trump and Pence, pointing to new measures taken by the White House including contact tracing and putting in place all guidelines recommended for essential workers.“We’ve taken every single precaution to protect the president,” McEnany insisted to reporters at a White House briefing. She also noted regular cleanings and adherence to distancing guidelines of six feet between individuals that are not always followed at crowded White House events.“We’ve done every single thing that Dr. (Deborah) Birx and Dr. (Anthony) Fauci have asked us to do,” she added, referring to highly respected physicians on the White House coronavirus task force.West Wing staffers around Trump and Pence have not been wearing masks regularly.Earlier on Friday, Trump was asked in a Fox News interview whether those who serve him food would now cover their faces. “They’ve already started,” he said on the network’s “Fox and Friends” morning program.The White House has also instituted daily, as opposed to weekly, coronavirus tests of Trump and Pence. Both men tested negative for the virus and were feeling well after the valet, a military service member who works as a White House assistant - came down with the virus.Trump told Fox News he has not yet been tested for antibodies to the coronavirus but probably would be soon. Such a test could confirm previous exposure.Trump and Pence maintain busy public schedules. The vice president, who has led the coronavirus task force, flew to Iowa on Friday to meet with faith leaders about holding “responsible” gatherings and to discuss the food supply at Midwestern grocery chain Hy-Vee Inc’s headquarters.News of the positive test for Pence’s aide prompted staff to deplane Air Force 2 on Friday morning and briefly delayed the takeoff.“We went back and looked into all the person’s contacts most recently,” a senior official told reporters, according to a pool report. Six individuals who may have been in contact with the infected aide were removed from the flight and later tested negative. Two of the individuals were members of Pence’s press office.Trump on Friday attended a public event at the World War Two memorial with elderly veterans where neither Trump, first lady Melania Trump, the veterans nor military officials seen at the ceremony wore masks.Trump later met face-to-face with Republican members of Congress at the White House where no face masks appeared to be worn. The lawmakers were tested for the virus before the meeting.DICTATORS, KINGS, AND QUEENSProtective facial coverings have been a hard sell for Trump and Pence despite a recommendation from the Centers for Disease Control that people wear masks or alternatives.Both Trump and Pence have drawn fire for not donning masks, with critics arguing they are setting a bad example for Americans.Trump himself has said he would not wear a mask and has not publicly worn one to any of his events amid the pandemic, but told reporters this week he tried some on behind the scenes during his visit to a Honeywell face mask factory in Arizona.The virus, which first surfaced in Wuhan, China late last year, has infected more than a million Americans and driven millions into unemployment as a result of lockdown measures put in place to curb a rise in infections.

09-05-2020||World||Triple antiviral drug shows early promise in Covid-19 trial||A triple drug combination of antiviral medicines helped relieve symptoms in patients with mild to moderate Covid-19 infection and swiftly reduced the amount of virus in their bodies, according to results of a small trial in Hong Kong.The trial, which involved 127 patients, compared those given the combination drug - made up of the HIV medicine lopinavir–ritonavir, the hepatitis drug ribavirin, and the multiple sclerosis treatment interferon beta - with a control group given just the HIV drug.The findings, published in the Lancet medical journal, showed that on average, people who got the triple drug reached the point of no detectable virus five days earlier than those in the control group - at 7 days versus 12 days.“Our trial demonstrates that early treatment of mild to moderate Covid-19 with a triple combination of antiviral drugs may rapidly suppress the amount of virus in a patient’s body, relieve symptoms, and reduce the risk to health-care workers,” said Kwok-Yung Yuen, a professor at the University of Hong Kong who co-led the research.He said the lower risk to health workers would be due to the combination drug’s effect in reducing ‘viral shedding’ - which is when the virus is detectable and potentially transmissible.In the trial, all patients received standard hospital care as needed, including ventilation support, dialysis support, antibiotics and corticosteroids.Kowk-Yung Yuen said the findings were “encouraging”, but that the triple drug’s effect now needed to be tested in larger numbers of patients and in people with more severe Covid-19 illness.Independent experts agreed that the findings were positive, but said larger and more detailed studies would be needed.This ... definitely justifies the consideration of adding interferon beta to the list of genuinely, evidence-based, promising treatments to be tested in further randomised trials,” said Stephen Evans, a professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine.He said that long years of experience in treating the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes AIDS have shown that it is best treated with combinations of different drugs “and this could also be the case with Covid-19”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/triple-antiviral-drug-shows-early-promise-in-covid-19-trial/story-kpd6uPrQYq1v8s32Ovc2bJ.html

The news has come on a day when the world quietly observed VE Day to mark the surrender of Nazi forces in Europe on May 8, 1945. The previous record of job losses in the US, at 10.4%, was recorded way back in 1948.

There is no need for the people to get panicky,” he said.In the morning, tense situation prevailed at the LG Polymers plant at R R Venkatapuram village, where hundreds of people belonging to the surrounding villages staged a dharna demanding immediate closure of the plant.Several men and women tried to barge into the plant premises even as state Director General of Police Gautam Sawang was inspecting the storage tank from where leakage of Styrene gas took place. They raised slogans like “we want justice,” and “close down the company.”The irate villagers stopped ambulances carrying bodies of three victims from King George Hospital mortuary to their respective villages for cremation and kept them on the road in front the company gate to stage a dharna.Also Read: TDP slams YSRC on Vizag gas leak, accuses govt of being lenient with LG PolymersThe protestors tried to gherao the DGP as he was coming out of the plant. A woman protester fell on his feet demanding justice, but she was pushed away by the women constables.

With this, the city has reported 276 new Covid-19 cases and 29 deaths in the past seven days.Thirteen of Bengal’s 23 districts have reported new cases in the last week and Kolkata has emerged as the state’s greatest challenge. It is mainly because of the sharp increase in the numbers in Kolkata that Bengal’s overall graph is also rising. The state recorded 527 new cases and 38 deaths in the past seven days.The situation is most critical in boroughs 1 to 9 sprawling across north and central Kolkata and parts of south Kolkata, and borough no 15 in western Kolkata, covering mostly the Garden Reach area. Of the total 326 containment zones in the city, 255 are between wards no 1 and 90 of the total 144-ward Kolkata Municipal Corporation.“The situation is worse in ward no 66, where there are 11 containment zones. Besides, ward no 60 has nine containment zones and ward no 18 has seven,” said a KMC official.Ward no 66 covers Tangra and Topsia area in central and south Kolkata. Ward 18 covers parts of Shobhabazar neighbourhood in north Kolkata, while ward 60 covers the Park Circus neighbourhood in central Kolkata.Overall, 911 people tested positive in Kolkata and 116 of them died, with 64 deaths attributed to Covid-19 and 52 to co-morbidity.“Cases in Kolkata are certainly increasing but there are also positive examples of densely populated areas reporting no new cases since been put under complete lockdown. Besides, the KMC has also started a door-to-door survey for Covid-19 symptoms and collection of swab samples from every household within containment zones,” said TMC Rajya Sabha MP Santanu Sen, who is also a doctor, a KMC corporator, and is playing a leading role in the Mamata Banerjee government’s battle against Covid-19.“We are entirely sealing containment zones with barricades. The police are helping people with doorstep delivery of essentials. Grocery shops, medicine shops and rickshaw-pullers have been roped in for this purpose,” said a senior officer of Kolkata police who did not want to be named.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), however, has blamed a lax lockdown in Kolkata for this steep rise. “The chief minister allowed sweetmeat shops to function. She took a casual approach and her police took the cue from her. People freely crowded markets. We are afraid that the lockdown in Kolkata is going to continue longer than other major cities in the country,” said BJP state unit president Dilip Ghosh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kolkata-registers-276-new-covid-19-cases-29-deaths-in-7-days/story-8FDnVRWnwbU0EsJ7kQnV0I.html
09-05-2020||India||Govt rejects Nepal protest on Lipulekh||New DelhiNew Delhi on Saturday rejected Kathmanu’s protest against the construction of a road to Lipulekh on the border with China, saying the region is “completely within the territory of India” and both sides can resolve boundary issues through diplomatic dialogue.Earlier in the day, Nepal expressed regret at the inauguration of the route from Dharchula in Uttarakhand to Lipulekh, with a statement from the foreign ministry contending the road “passes through Nepali territory”.Defence minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated the 80-km road on Friday to curtail the time taken for the pilgrimage to Kailash-Mansarovar. The road ends at Lipulekh Pass, and will help pilgrims avoid dangerous high-altitude routes through Sikkim and Nepal.“The recently inaugurated road section in Pithoragarh district in the state of Uttarakhand lies completely within the territory of India. The road follows the pre-existing route used by the pilgrims of the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said.India had improved the road for the ease and convenience of pilgrims, local residents and traders, he said.India and Nepal have an established mechanism for boundary issues, and the delineation of the border with Nepal is ongoing, Srivastava said. India is also committed to resolving outstanding boundary issues through diplomatic dialogue, he added.The two countries are in the process of scheduling talks between their foreign secretaries, which will be held after they have dealt with the Covid-19 crisis, Srivastava said.Nepal’s foreign ministry emphasised the country’s claim on Lipulekh. It said in a statement: “The government of Nepal has consistently maintained that as per the Sugauli Treaty (1816), all the territories east of Kali (Mahakali) River, including Limpiyadhura, Kalapani and Lipu Lekh, belong to Nepal.”The development comes at a time when Nepal has also been irked by the depiction of Kalapani as part of Uttarakhand in new Indian maps showing the union territory of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh. Nepal had sought talks to address the Kalapani issue but New Delhi rejected Kathmandu’s protest, saying the new maps accurately depict Indian territory.The statement from Nepal’s foreign ministry said Kathmanu had reiterated its claim to all territories east of the Mahakali river several times, most recently through a diplomatic note sent to New Delhi on November 20 last year.The “unilateral act” of opening the new road “runs against the understanding reached between the two countries, including at the level of Prime Ministers, that a solution to boundary issues would be sought through negotiation”, the statement said.Nepal also said it is committed to a diplomatic solution to boundary issues on the “basis of the historical treaty, documents, facts and maps”. The Nepal government called on India to refrain from “any activity inside the territory of Nepal”, and pointed out Kathmandu had expressed its disagreement in 2015, through separate diplomatic notes sent to New Delhi and Beijing, when India and China agreed to include Lipulekh Pass as a bilateral trade route.Nepal’s foreign ministry also brought up the issue of a report prepared by the “Eminent Persons Group” of the two sides to recommend measures to elevate existing relations, and said the document should be made public.“The Group has concluded its task and prepared a consensus report. The government of Nepal is ready to receive the report and believes that it will be in the interest of the two countries to implement its recommendations which will also help address the outstanding issues left by the history...,” the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-rejects-nepal-protest-on-lipulekh/story-vnQxIGYRpkOpOoD9vGjsVL.html

09-05-2020||India||Coronavirus update: 7 days after Priyanka, Rahul repeats demand to audit PM Cares fund||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has demanded an audit of the PM CARES fund set up by the Central government for receiving donations to aid in government’s fight against the coronavirus pandemic outbreak in the country and other crises of similar magnitude in the future.PM CARES fund was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in March and it invites donations from individuals and institutions. Rahul says it has received huge contributions even from public sector units like the Railways and should, therefore, be open for audits and a public disclosure for the sake of transparency. “The #PmCares fund has received huge contributions from PSUs & major public utilities like the Railways. It’s important that PM ensures the fund is audited & that the record of money received and spent is available to the public,” Rahul said on Saturday.Railways minister Piyush Goyal was quoted in reports pledging Rs 151 crore to the PM CARES fund in the last week of March this year. The fund has also received several hundred crores of rupees in donation from other contributors—both in the public and the private sector. All BJP MPs have also donated Rs 1 crore each from their annual development fund along with a month’s salary.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesPM-CARES or Prime Minister’s Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations Fund was announced in the month of March and the PM said it is meant to further strengthen India’s disaster management capacities and encourage research on technologies to protect citizens from disasters such as the one brought upon by the coronavirus pandemic.

09-05-2020||India||‘Acted after Amit Shah’s letter’: Railways counter Bengal’s claim on migrants’ return||The Ministry of Railways on Saturday night rebutted Bengal’s ruling party Trinamool Congress’ claim that the state had made arrangements for eight trains to bring back migrants from four other states that are scheduled to reach Bengal over the next three days.Trinamool Congress and the state government made these claims after union home minister Amit Shah wrote to Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, accusing the state of not supporting the Centre in allowing Bengal’s migrant workers stranded in other states to reach Bengal.“Amit Shah’s letter is full of outright lies. Two trains have already reached and eight more are expected to reach Bengal in the coming three days. Overall, 80,000 people have already been brought back using various means of transport,” TMC Rajya Sabha leader and national spokesperson Derek O’Brien said on Saturday.TMC also alleged that the union home minister was deliberately spreading lies to play politics during an epidemic.O’Brien presented a document showing two trains each from Punjab and Tamil Nadu and three from Karnataka in the draft schedule of special trains, as of May 8, which will reach seven districts of Bengal between May 10 and 12, carrying 12,714 passengers altogether. Another train is scheduled to arrive in Malda district on May 10, carrying 1,721 passengers from Telangana.The Railways, however, contested TMC’s claims in a series of three tweets on Saturday night.“Indian Railways has so far run more than 300 trains mainly for states like UP, Bihar, Odisha, and MP etc. But for WB till today morning we had received approval for only 2 Shramik special trains, 1 from Ajmer Sharif and the other from Ernakulam,” the Railways said, adding, “After the request of Hon’ble HM, this afternoon WB has approved 2 trains from Punjab, 2 from TN, 3 from Karnataka and 1 from Telangana, which are being arranged.”“However, WB has not approved any train from Maharashtra, while there is a requirement of 16 trains to WB and presently 6 requests are pending for which approval is still awaited from WB,” the ministry added.The Congress, meanwhile, has added a twist to the ongoing political blame-game by supporting the Centre’s version. “The chief minister has given permission to eight more trains after Shah wrote to the state,” alleged Congress’ leader in the Lok Sabha, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, who is an MP from Berhampore in West Bengal.Facing the ire of the BJP, the Congress and the Left parties, Mamata Banerjee’s TMC on Saturday said that the state had a “staggered plan” to bring back migrant workers stranded in other states. The state would also allow residents stranded abroad to return.A senior government official said that the state would not accept a large number of people from outside at one go. “It would not be right to accept more than 4,000-5,000 people on a single day. We are making plans for every single one of them depending on his or her residential address and health status. We can’t do something that could lead to a steep rise in the state’s Covid-19 graph,” a top official of the state government said, requesting anonymity.Over the last week, 13 of Bengal’s 23 districts reported new Covid-19 cases.At the state secretariat, home secretary Alapan Bandyopadhyay said that pilgrims stranded in Haridwar, Dwarka and other religious places would also be brought back in batches. “Many people from the neighbouring states of Bihar, Odisha and Jharkhand came to the state borders by walking there. We made all arrangements to safely send them home,” Bandyopadhyay said.O’Brien said that the state had a seven-stage plan to bring back migrants. “We are doing it in a staggered manner. Everyone stranded in other states would be brought back but in batches. The prime minister announced the lockdown without an iota of planning. We don’t want to bring the migrant workers back without having an elaborate plan,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/acted-after-amit-shah-s-letter-railways-counter-bengal-s-claim-on-migrants-return/story-SWQAJonpTm9U020kpwdLnJ.html

09-05-2020||India||Covid-19 update: Revised govt policy specifies when to discharge a positive patient||The union ministry of health on Saturday issued revised discharge policy for patients admitted to the government’s three-tier Covid medical management system, clearly listing out conditions for discharging mild, moderate and severe cases. For the first category of mild and very mild cases or pre-symptomatic cases at a Covid Care facility, the revised guideline sets the requirement of spending three days without fever and passage of 10 days since the onset of symptoms for discharge. Such cases do not need to be tested for a negative finding for Covid-19 virus before they are discharged, the revised policy states. However, such mild and very mild cases must be kept under regular temperature and pulse oximetry monitoring at the Covid Care facility during their stay and should follow home isolation for 7 days as per the relevant guidelines issued by the health ministry after their discharge.The revised guidelines add that a mild or very mild patient needs to be moved to a dedicated Covid Health Centre (DCHC) if the oxygen saturation dips below 95% at any point of time prior to the discharge from the CCC.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesIf the patients in the above category (mild/very mild/ pre-symptomatic) again develop symptoms of fever, cough or breathing difficulty after the discharge from CCC, then they will need to contact the CCC or the state helpline or 1075 for revaluation. Such cases will again be followed up through a tele-conference on 14th day, says the guideline.The second category of patients that fall under moderate classification are described as those whose symptoms resolve within three days and oxygen saturation levels are maintained above 95% for the next four days.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19The revised guideline says that such cases will undergo monitoring of body temperature and oxygen saturation at the Covid Health Centres (CHC) that have the facility for oxygen beds.If the fever resolve within 3 days and the patient maintains saturation above 95% for the next 4 days without oxygen support, then the moderate patient can be discharged but not before 10 days have passed since the onset of symptomsAdditionally, the following three conditions must also be met for the discharge of patients in the above category. 1. Absence of fever without antipyretics2. Resolution of breathlessness3. No oxygen requirementEven in moderate cases, there will be no need for testing prior to discharge, and the patient will be advised to be in home isolation for 7 days as per the guidelines issued by the health ministry in this regard.For patients who are on oxygenation and whose fever does not resolve within 3 days and demand of oxygen therapy continues, the revised guidelines say that such patients will be discharged only after the resolution of all clinical symptoms of coronavirus and the ability to maintain oxygen saturation for 3 consecutive days.And finally for patients classified as ‘severe’, including immunocompromised patients--HIV patients, transplant recipients, malignancy--- the discharge criteria will be based on clinical recovery, confirmatory RT-PCR test after resolution of symptoms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-update-revised-govt-policy-specifies-when-to-discharge-a-positive-patient/story-LNSuPPIZdXWh3xSVxSXHEL.html

09-05-2020||India||Aarogya Setu app alerted govt to 300 ‘emerging hotspots’ which could have been missed out: Amitabh Kant||Aarogya Setu, the government’s mobile application developed to track Covid-19 patients, has emerged as a powerful tool to curb the spread of coronavirus Covid-19 as it helped alert authorities about more than 650 hotspots across the country and over 300 “emerging hotspots” which could have been missed otherwise. Since its launch on April 2 this year, over 96 million people have registered with the Aarogya Setu health care application, which has become the fastest mobile app to reach 50 million users globally and will be one of the fastest entrant to the 100 million club. The Aarogya Setu has helped the government with its twin objective -- “whom to test” and “where to test more” in its battle against Covid-19. Speaking to ANI, Niti Ayog CEO Amitabh Kant said: “For instance, in Maharashtra, the engine identified over 60 hotspots across 18 districts. Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageAcross the nation, the engine predicted about 130 hotspots at the sub-post office level between April 13 to April 20. Later, these forecasted hotspots were declared as ‘real hotspots’ by the Union Health Ministry some 3 to 17 days after being alerted by Aarogya Setu. This way, the engine helped the government with “whom to test” and “where to test more” against the coronavirus.”“The Aarogya Setu App alerted the government about more than 650 hotspots across the country and over 300 emerging hotspots which could have been missed otherwise. It gives accurate forecast of hotspots and it is also preventing the origin of newer hotspots. The engine has generated incredible insights and impact with precise projections of locality, direction and velocity of the spread of infection,” he said.The Niti Ayog chief informed that so far around 69 million people have taken the self-assessment test, an adoption rate of more than 71 per cent, out of which, over 3.4 million people have self-declared themselves as unwell since they were showing one or more than three symptoms. With this, a dedicated team of over 70 healthcare workers have reached to people who displayed two or more than two symptoms of Covid-19.”This is how a dedicated team of more than 70 healthcare workers have reached out to about 650,000 people who showed two or more symptoms. More than 16,000 people have been administered follow-up tele-consultation by doctors,” he said. At least 12,500 users, who downloaded the Aarogya Setu, have detected positive for COVID-19 so far. The Bluetooth based interaction data has led to around 60,000 people being assessed and alerted at various degrees of risk which include self-isolation, quarantine and testing.About 8,500 people have tested from the set of people assessed as high-risk and of which more than 23 per cent have tested COVID-19 positive so far giving an extraordinary testing accuracy.The efficacy of testing recommended by Aarogya Setu is much higher than any testing protocol anywhere in the world and it manifolds higher than the current overall efficacy of testing in India, Kant said. The Aarogya Setu app is available in 12 different languages and soon it is set to expand to all 22 scheduled Indian languages, the Niti Aayog CEO added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aarogya-setu-app-alerted-govt-to-300-emerging-hotspots-which-could-have-been-missed-out-amitabh-kant/story-5KRc3Bxgr3DhAqUL3iDy8H.html

This is done through an elaborate network of importers, customs house agents, transporters and the operation is financed through illegal international hawala channels,” it said. Investigation also established that the seized consignment was a part of a total of five consignments of drugs, out of which four had been successfully smuggled into India, it added.Ranjit Singh is also prime accused in the recent Hizbul Mujahideen terror funding module which was busted with the arrest of Hilal Ahmad Wagay, a resident of Nowgam, Awantipora, Jammu and Kashmir with Rs 29 lakh cash in Amritsar by Punjab Police on April 25.“This money was being transported to the Kashmir valley to be handed over to Riyaz Naikoo (now killed), chief operational commander of Hizbul Mujahideen. This case has been taken over by NIA,” the agency said.Ranjit Singh along with his five brothers has been involved in smuggling and trade of drugs for the past many years, it added.“Pakistan based terrorist organisations are using narcotic trade to generate funds for terror activities in India. The proceeds of narcotic trade are transferred to Kashmir valley through couriers and hawala channel for terrorist purposes,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-nabs-alleged-narco-terrorist-with-hizbul-link-from-sirsa/story-c8XZ7ilkXA3KmUzstyPWnJ.html

In other districts too cases are being reported as migrants from Surat are returning back to their homes.Ganjam district collector Vijay Aamrita Kulange said Section-144 has been imposed around all Covid-19 medical camps/institutional quarantine centres where migrants have been housed by the government.Kulange said no one will be allowed to enter within 100 m radius of the quarantine centres and directed the Superintendent of Police, Sub-Divisional Magistrates, Executive Magistrates and inspectors of police stations to keep a close watch on the centres.The decision comes after a video of people violating the norms in quarantine centres went viral.In one quarantine centre of Sergarh block housing, 80 migrant workers from Surat, their kin were seen delivering food and betel to the inmates at the gate violating social distance norms.Earlier this week, 128 Surat-returned migrant labourers had fled from two Covid-19 quarantine centres in Beguniapada block in Ganjam district before they were caught.The state government has also increased the quarantine period for returnees from 14 days to 28 days as many of the positive cases were found after the 14-day quarantine period.“Returnees from other states will have to undergo an institutional quarantine of 21 days followed by home quarantine for next seven days,” said Odisha’s chief spokesperson on Covid-19, Subroto Bagchi.The order came even as two persons died in two separate quarantine centres of Ganjam and Sonepur districts.On Friday afternoon, a 40-year-old man who had returned from Surat and showed Covid-19 symptoms died before his swab sample could be tested; while in Sonepur, a migrant labourer from Bengal died in the quarantine centre Saturday morning. However, he did not show any Covid-19 symptoms.Officials said Friday’s stay order by the Supreme Court on the Orissa High Court order of stopping travel of migrant workers without Covid-19 test in the originating state would lead to a massive surge in positive cases. On Thursday, the Orissa High Court had directed the state government to not let migrant workers board trains to Odisha without testing them for Covid-19.Over 46,000 people have returned to Odisha from different states and another five lakh migrants are expected to turn up. On Saturday, 5 special trains carrying migrants left for Odisha from Gujarat, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu. The trains will reach Odisha on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/quarantines-centres-in-odisha-s-ganjam-under-section-144-over-covid-19-worry/story-nNnw7qvUw5WQtjhK0rZxtL.html

We were able to identify by people through their pictures caught on other cameras and are interrogating them as to why they were inside the forests. But due to the lockdown the investigation is not progressing at a good speed,” said Rahul, who uses only his first name.Officials said three persons have been taken in so far for questioning and two more are still missing.But the Corbett administration has increased vigil and is ensuring that any untoward activity can be avoided. The director said that it is very difficult to monitor the boundaries of the park due to the lockdown because there could always be people waiting to enter the forests.“Due to the lockdown it is difficult to take pre-emptive actions in nearby villages and find out if there is any new movement or people who have settled in and due to these challenges we are keeping a vigil day and night through almost 500 camera traps and around 12-15 watch towers in key areas apart from regular patrolling during the day,” said Rahul.These camera traps, still cameras and video cameras had been set up in March this year to keep an eye on any kind of movement and for surveillance inside the park.“We are also doing ambush patrolling at sensitive points across the boundary of Corbett where a team of armed forest staff of around four-five members camp at night and ascertain that there is no human activity inside the park like lighting a fire or anything similar. We also use night vision binoculars to keep an eye from the watch towers,” added Rahul.Elaborating on e-surveillance, Rahul said that from Ramnagar to Kalagarh, there are ten towers where thermal cameras have been installed for better surveillance.“These cameras are connected to our tiger cell in Ramnagar through radios where we can check continuous live footage of any movement in that region. Around 40 km of boundary is covered by these cameras, so we are constantly ensuring that untoward activities are kept under check,” said Rahul.The Wildlife Crime Control Bureau in the last week of April had issued an alert asking tiger reserves and forest departments to increase vigil and strengthening of intelligence network after a few members of the notorious Bawaria gang went missing from their original spots in Haryana and Punjab, said officials.Amid the coronavirus outbreak across the country, the Uttarakhand forest department in March had ordered that Corbett Tiger Reserve, along with all protected areas and zoos in the state remain closed till further notice.Believed to have around 260 tigers at present, Corbett Tiger Reserve which is spread across 1,288.31 square kilometers is one of the most –frequented tourist destinations in the state. The gates of Corbett open on November 15 every year for six months till mid June. Corbett witnesses a footfall of around 3 lakh tourists every year across its six eco-tourism zones, with Dhikala and Bijrani being the most popular ones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ambush-patrolling-e-surveillance-how-corbett-is-being-guarded-during-lockdown/story-iaoj8ET3GOhVLylFVxfFNO.html
09-05-2020||India||‘Celebrations can wait’: Clerics to CM Mamata on lifting lockdown after Eid||The Bengal Imams’ Association, a body of Islamic clerics in the state, has urged chief minister Mamata Banerjee not to lift the lockdown before Eid Ul Fitr scheduled on May 25, under any circumstances.“The Union government has announced lockdown till May 17. In our state, it has already been extended till May 21. The holy Eid Ul Fitr is on May 25. The government may consider relaxing the lockdown due to Eid. But, we request the Bengal government to extend the lockdown for a few more days. Let people live first, celebrations can take place later,” Md. Yahiya, chairman of the Bengal Imams’ Association wrote in a letter to the chief minister on Saturday.Yahiya proposed that the lockdown be extended till May 30.“We request you to raise this demand before the Centre as well. The Muslim leadership will stand by the government,” Yahiya wrote.No one from the government or the ruling party, Trinamool Congress, agreed to speak on record. “The chief minister herself will take a call considering all aspects,” said a senior minister of the state government who did not want to be identified.Incidentally, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had on April 26 urged people to pray during the month of Ramzaan to get rid of coronavirus before Eid.The clerics’ call came at a time when the Covid-19 graph in Bengal is steadily rising, reporting 527 cases over the past five days.Earlier, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the principal opposition in the state, had accused the Mamata Banerjee government of turning a blind eye to the violation of lockdown measures in areas dominated by minorities in Kolkata and Howrah, the epicenters of the coronavirus infection in the state. “Mamata Banerjee continued with her politics of appeasement during this fight against the virus. She did not reveal details about Delhi’s Nizamuddin Markaz-returnees and everyone could see how the administration is turning a blind eye to lockdown violations in areas dominated by members of a special community,” BJP state unit president Dilip Ghosh said earlier this week.Muslims comprise 27.01% of the state’s population, according to the Census of 2011, and are a majority in three of Bengal’s 23 districts – Murshidabad, Malda and Uttar Dinajpur. Incidentally, Uttar Dinajpur has not recorded any case yet, while Malda has reported 3 and Murshidabad has reported 1 Covid-19 case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/celebrations-can-wait-clerics-to-cm-mamata-on-lifting-lockdown-after-eid/story-SWi9HEYpxd4YlWxe0V7WoN.html
09-05-2020||India||National Herald case: ED attaches part of nine-storey Mumbai building, Congress slams move||The Enforcement Directorate on Saturday “partially” attached a nine-storey building in Bandra (Mumbai) worth Rs 16.38 crore, in connection with its money laundering probe involving Associated Journals Limited (AJL), a company controlled by the Gandhi family and the publishers of the National Herald newspaper.ED said it has attached a part of the building, which has been established as “proceeds of crime” and notices regarding the attachment under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) have been issued to AJL and veteran Congress leader Moti Lal Vora, who happens to be the chairman and managing director of the company.The nine-floor building, located at plot number 2, Survey number 341, near Kala Nagar in Bandra (East), has two basements and a total built up area of 15,000 square meters and its total value is around Rs 120 crore.Former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda has been named as an accused in the case and both Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and ED have chargesheeted him in 2018 and 2019 respectively, along with Vora.Also Read: ED files charges against senior Congress leaders in National Herald caseThe ED has alleged that Hooda and Vora used proceeds of crime in the form of a plot – number C-17, Sector 6, Panchkula, allotted illegally to AJL and pledged it to avail loan from the Syndicate Bank branch on Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg in Delhi to construct this building in Bandra.“Thus, the said asset at Mumbai that germinated out of the proceeds of crime has been attached to the extent of Rs 16.38 crore. Further investigation is going on,” the agency said in a statement. The Panchkula plot has already been attached by the agency.The money laundering probe was based on allegations that the property was allotted to AJL in the year 1982 but was withdrawn by the Estate Officer, Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA) a decade later on October 30, 1992, since AJL did not comply with the conditions of allotment.“However, Hooda blatantly misused his official position and dishonestly allotted the said plot afresh in the guise of re-allotment to the AJL at original rates plus interest in violation of necessary conditions and policy of HUDA by an order of August 28, 2005, for Rs 59,39,200,” ED has claimed. The actual value of the property (Panchkula) is about Rs 64.93 crore, it said.The anti money laundering probe agency has further stated that Hooda, as the then CM, caused wrongful loss to HUDA and wrongful gain to AJL by ignoring legal opinion and recommendations of HUDA officers and financial commissioner and principal secretary, Town and Country Planning.The agency also said it found that Hooda, thrice granted undue extensions to AJL for construction on the said plot, and after acquisition projected it as untainted property and further acquired loans from the bank by way of mortgaging the same from time to time.Reacting to the development, senior Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi said, “This is a part of the continuing governmental tirade against National Herald. Since the primary allegations against National Herald are baseless, such attachment orders are equally baseless and untenable. They will be suitably challenged by proper legal recourse. There is also a continuing process of spreading misinformation by authorities in this regard. The government would be far better advised to use its energies to battle Covid instead of such wasteful exercises.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/national-herald-case-ed-attaches-part-of-nine-storey-mumbai-building-congress-slams-move/story-loFUxymMPRDBsC0lM60nzM.html

The previous TDP government had also given consent for operations without obtaining proper environmental clearance.On Saturday, the TDP president dashed off a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to rope in national and international health experts for assessment of the health of the people affected by the gas leakage from the LG Polymers firm.Expressing doubts over the content of the gas leaked from the plant, Naidu pointed out that though the company claimed that the gas that had leaked was Styrene, there were also reports of other toxic gases being in it.The TDP chief had earlier demanded that the LG Polymers be closed forthwith pending investigation. He also lashed out at chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy for not taking action against the company till date.“Filled with fear, people of Vizag are sleeping on the roads. Local residents are protesting on the streets for justice. Bereaved families are weeping alongside the bodies of their loved ones. Not a single arrest made nor a single asset seized. Where is @ysjagan? #VizagDemandsJustice,” he tweeted.Senior TDP lawmaker K Atchen Naidu, who called on the affected people in King George Hospital in Visakhapatnam, demanded that the Jagan government put pressure on LG Polymers to pay a compensation of Rs 10 crore to each of the families of the deceased.“We thought Jagan would deal with the company firmly, but he was soft on them after meeting the company representatives in the Visakhapatnam airport,” the TDP leader alleged.Meanwhile, the YSRC has revealed that it was the Chandrababu Naidu government which had, in January 2017, given the consent for operation for LG Polymers till December 31, 2021. The company also got the approval for expansion of its manufacturing capacity from 415 tonnes per day to 655 tonnes per day in 213 acres of land allotted by the government at a capital cost of Rs 168 crore.The ruling party also revealed a government order issued in August 2015, which sought to de-notify 128.24 acres of land from the purview of Simhachalam Temple administration and allot it to LG Polymers. This piece of temple land was allotted to the company’s original promoter Hindustan Polymers Ltd in 1964, but it got into a dispute later.The YSRC reminded that in June 2018, when Naidu was in power, the AP Pollution Control Board had given hazardous waste disposal authorization which is valid till April 30, 2023.It also pointed out that the company had gone in for expansion without obtaining environmental clearance during the TDP regime in 2018 itself. Following the objections from the Ministry of Environment and Forests, it had submitted an affidavit admitting its violation in May 2019, the ruling party said.Minister for municipal administration Botsa Satyanarayana reminded that it was Naidu, who had announced during the Partnership Summit in 2018 that LG Polymers was going in for expansion.“He was the person who had colluded with the company. We have already declared that stern action would be taken against the company, if the high-powered committee made such a recommendation,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tdp-slams-ysrc-on-vizag-gas-leak-accuses-govt-of-being-lenient-with-lg-polymers/story-gL1f5gtEO6pwxyeoGDKdHL.html

This is a mandatory drill for all hospital staff treating Covid-19 patients. “It was around 9 pm that my wife called up to say that our son was sick. He was vomiting and apparently down with some gastric infection. I could do little, but the family with the help of a neighbour, who drives a taxi, took the child to the nearest hospital in Chinhat. The hospital refused to admit my child after which the family was informed about another hospital in Alambagh. That hospital too refused to admit my son,” says Manish.“My wife then rushed him to King George’s Medical University (KGMU). By this time, I had called up my seniors in the hospital, who had dialled KGMU where the doctors immediately attended to him but a lot of time had been lost by then,” he recalls.He said his son tested negative for coronavirus. He suspects that it was the fear of infection because of which the private hospitals refused to attend to his child.“How can one deny treatment to a child in an emergency?” he asks.“Main ladke ko galey bhi nahi laga paya (I couldn’t even embrace my dear son as I was quarantined). With special permission, I did go to KGMU in an ambulance after wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) kit. Yet, I didn’t go near my family or for that near anyone. I could only watch my son from a distance as he left us,” he says.In the morning, the child was buried in the family’s village on the outskirts of Lucknow.“I am still unable to get over the fact that he might have been alive if the private hospitals had attended to him,” he said.Manish’s quarantine has ended but he hasn’t resumed his duties while his wife is still inconsolable.“My wife continues to sob uncontrollably. I put duty over my family responsibilities first. I had lost my father sometime back and now this. Don’t know how life will shape up now,” he said. The hospital authorities say they are in regular touch with the ward boy who was employed on a contractual basis four years back. He had been on Covid duty since February.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/couldn-t-even-hug-my-son-a-quarantined-man-s-pain-of-losing-his-child/story-cuWItY1jTStz6quTwzZGZL.html

We’ll continue our strict surveillance. We can’t allow people to enter Kerala without valid passes. It’s mandatory for people coming from other states to carry passes from their place of origin to their chosen destination in a bid to contain the viral outbreak,” he added.The CM also announced that the state government would arrange special trains from New Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, etc; to bring back all those who are stranded.“We’re in talks with the Union Ministry of Railways. Among the stranded, students, pregnant women, and senior citizens will get first priority to come back home,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-indians-flown-back-from-gulf-to-kerala-test-covid-positive/story-3PShMQHKaIYTT4bH39NHkM.html

Various petitions were also filed in the Supreme Court seeking assistance for lawyers who have been struggling due to lack of work during Covid-19.The Supreme Court Bar Association in April set up a Covid-19 Helping Scheme for providing financial assistance to lawyers during the lockdown.“The study does not surprise me. Early years at the bar have traditionally been years of strained circumstances. With the many high-priced law-schools churning out smart freshers, these small earnings look even smaller especially for those who come from no family background of law,” said senior advocate Sanjay Hegde.The participants in the survey also expressed their lack of confidence in the court when it came to giving lawyers a fair hearing in cases.66 per cent of surveyed lawyers across 8 high courts in the country said that their chance of getting a fair hearing from the court depends upon the composition of the bench.Over 83 per cent of lawyers surveyed at the high courts of Calcutta (97 per cent), Delhi (83 per cent) and Patna (93 per cent) felt that their chance of getting a fair hearing depends on the bench.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/50-per-cent-high-court-lawyers-say-junior-advocates-earn-less-than-rs-10-000-survey/story-DV8iGsnOtuNI84KrFCXIlJ.html

09-05-2020||India||Aarogya Setu app rule for private offices, not for domestic helps: Official||The Union home ministry’s lockdown guidelines that mandate employers to ensure that their employees have the Aarogya Setu mobile app does not apply to domestic helps, a senior Union home ministry official said on Saturday.The official said this provision was clearly designed for public and private offices.Officials said the government wants to encourage everyone with a smartphone to download the Aarogya Setu app. “But the harsh reality is that not everyone has a smartphone,” a second official said.India has 1.2 billion mobile phones; only 350 million are smartphones.The home ministry official’s clarification to the question came following multiple complaints on social media and elsewhere about housing societies barring domestic helps from resuming work unless they install the mobile application.Many can’t afford one. One of them said that there was a smartphone at home but that was being used by her son to attend online classes at home.Office-bearers at the housing societies have cited the provision in the home ministry’s National Directive for Covid-19 Management to insist on the mobile app.According to the national directive for work places, “Use of Arogya Setu app shall be made mandatory for all employees, both private and public. It shall be the responsibility of the Head of the respective organisations to ensure 100% coverage of this app among the employees”.Officials said domestic helps did not fall under this category. If they did, then all households who employ one would be required to comply with all other provisions listed for work places including use of thermal scanning devices, repeated sanitation of the premises through the day and earmarking quarantine areas to isolate employees showing symptoms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aarogya-setu-app-rule-for-private-offices-not-for-domestic-helps-official/story-DF6DPhpFqTnyUcX3ln84cM.html
09-05-2020||India||J-K administration may keep internet suspended for a few more days||The Jammu and Kashmir administration is contemplating a move to suspend mobile internet connectivity for a few more days, though prepaid mobile phones were restored late on Friday night.Authorities had snapped mobile internet across Kashmir as an operation to nab Hizbul Mujahideen operational commander Riyaz Naikoo was underway at Gulzapora Beighpora on Wednesday, and only broadband connectivity through fixed line telephones was available in the region. The police have apprehensions that Naikoo’s killing could trigger massive clashes like those witnessed after the killing of Burhan Wani in 2016, and believe it would be better for mobile internet services to remain suspended for some more time. Police officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they didn’t want to take any chances this time. “After the killing of Naikoo, there were clashes at some places. To prevent the spread of the clashes in different parts of South Kashmir, the internet was snapped. It could be restored with a few days,” said a senior police officer. People familiar with developments said the government had decided to restore mobile phone services on Friday night. However, a high-level meeting decided that mobile internet connectivity would remain suspended till the 17th day of the holy month of Ramzan (May 11). The day coincides with Badr, the first and decisive battle in the history of Islam when the first few hundred adherents of the religion took on their powerful opponents in Arabia and won, according to historical accounts. There are also inputs from intelligence agencies that militants might try to target security force installations on the day of Badr.The intelligence agencies had earlier issued warnings about attacks on this particular day. Last year too, there were similar reports about possible attacks on the 17th of Ramzan.Already, 3G and 4G services have been barred in Kashmir despite numerous appeals from mainstream political leaders and only 2G services were restored, resulting in very slow internet connectivity. Officials in Jammu and Kashmir contend that restoration of 4G services could give rise to anti-national activities and militancy. Kashmir’s divisional commissioner Pandurang K Pole described the suspension of mobile internet connectivity as a temporary measure and said services would be restored very soon.Director general of police Dilbag Singh told Hindustan Times that after the killing of Naikoo, the Hizb had become headless and this was a setback for the group. “Now it has to be seen how long Pakistan will keep this group headless,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/j-k-administration-may-keep-internet-suspended-for-a-few-more-days/story-6MJo3mb8ftDSCiTg87YCxL.html
09-05-2020||India||Containment zones boost Chennai’s efforts to efforts to flatten Covid-19 curve||Tin sheets cordon off both ends of the West Madha Church street in North Chennai’s Royapuram, where a social work graduate student lives with her parents. Her lane is one of 357 containment zones in the city and 711 in Tamil Nadu’s 36 districts. “Last week there was a positive case discovered 2-3 houses down the street above the neighbourhood supermarket,” the 21-year-old told HT. “After that these tin sheets came up overnight. It is when the virus was next door that fear and anxiety gripped the area,” she said. The first containment zone in North Chennai came up as early as April 2 after which the corporation has been learning on the job, officials said. “Initially our containment zones were defined in a very expansive manner,” said a senior official. Drones with speakers flew overhead to check if people were congregating on roof tops and to make announcements. “Then we realised that this is counterproductive. If we close down a large area, then it will be impossible to monitor. It made more sense to define a more compact containment zone and enforce containment of a smaller group of families,” the official said.Now, on average, each containment zone monitors 150 families. One case is enough to contain an area. The transformation from a neighbourhood into a containment zone is swift. First, the person who tested positive is taken to hospital, then all his family and direct contacts are traced, tested and quarantined and third, in consultation with the police, the area is cordoned off. “We have registers outside containment zones which records how many people come in and go out every day. Movement is severely restricted for emergency cases only. We are working to ensure groceries and vegetables are supplied every day outside the barricades,” said the official.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage.Furthermore, zonal classification of districts are based on hotspot analysis set down by the Centre. Red zones or hotspot districts are demarcated on the basis of active cases; green zones are districts with either zero confirmed cases till date or no confirmed case in the last 21 days; while the orange zones are districts that are neither red nor green. As of May 5, Tamil Nadu has 12 districts are in the red zone, while 25 are in the orange zone. Krishnagiri, which was a green zone, was redesignated an orange zone after one positive case was reported on Wednesday. Though the first case in the city was reported on March 7, TN created a containment zone plan after a religious conference of the Tablighi Jamaat held in New Delhi in mid-March was declared a hotspot. By April 1, the state had rolled out a detailed plan to track the attendees, their family members, and their primary contacts to test them for Covid-19. Health workers conducted door-to-door surveillance of the attendees’ families across several districts and authorities were instructed to cordon off a radius of 7-8 km around the attendees’ homes. In all, 1480 attendees and their contacts were traced and tested. Since the beginning of the week, Chennai’s wholesale fruit and vegetable market, Koyembedu, has been shut as it was found to be a Covid-19 hotspot; officials fear that the number of people who will need to be tracked may well be more than those associated with the religious conference. Of the 508 positive cases on May 5, a large number were linked to the wholesale market.The case of ChennaiThe state which has been in continuous lockdown since the last week of March, saw its caseload grow by 2089 in April; Chennai alone accounted for 880 of those. Of the 15 containment zones in Chennai, six including zone 5 where the 21-year-old graduate student lives, is under the scanner of the Corporation. At a press conference last week, Corporation commissioner G Prakash said that northern Chennai, which accounts for a majority of the city’s cases, will see further containment efforts.Over the weekend, the Tamil Nadu government announced a graded relaxation for commercial and industrial units across the state; this does not apply to any containment area. Offices were also allowed to resume work with 20 persons or 25% of the work force, whichever is lower. The government has begun to offer e-passes to allow people to move within districts, between districts and even travel outside the state specifically for marriages, funerals or medical emergencies. The government has also started a website in which migrants are expected to register their details, in order to return to their home states. Over 1.18 lakh people are reported to have registered already. Yet, on the first workday of this week, crowds thronged various parts of Chennai. This was worrying, because physical distancing and other safeguards remain vital to preventing the spread of the virus. Officials said that they have found it tough to enforce the lockdown even inside containment zones. A senior corporation official who did not wish to be named told HT: “To be honest, we can’t say we have done a perfect job, but we are doing our best. In a way these containment zones are like imprisoning people in their homes. We try our best to explain to people that we don’t have an alternative.” Last week, protests broke out in parts of Royapuram, where residents gathered in large groups and argued with police personnel at a barricade to allow them to go out to purchase groceries.Ali Basha, a 49-year-old who runs a tuition centre in Thiruvottiyur in North Chennai has been providing relief materials to families in his area since mid-April. “There was also a rumour doing the rounds in the early days of the lockdown that salty air from the sea breeze helps fight the virus. Since North Chennai is mainly on the coast, most people bought into this Whatsapp forward and didn’t really care much about the social distancing,” he said.In other parts of North Chennai, residents that HT spoke to, said they found inner roads to get around police barricades in containment zones. “Only 40% of those who step out really need to. The rest are people who are just curious how the city looks under a lockdown. They show up with their mobile phones so they can video call friends or relatives and give them a glimpse on how the roads or marketplaces look,” Basha said. Crowding around vegetable markets has also been a severe issue in the state prompting Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami to note early last week, “In corporations like Chennai, Coimbatore and Trichy, the problem lies in vegetable markets. No matter how much you tell people, they refuse to follow lockdown restrictions. They are playful.”Turning greenThis is not to say that other districts have not been able to reduce the spread of the pandemic-causing virus, Sars-Cov-2, during the lockdown. Erode in western Tamil Nadu, for instance, has slowly fought its way out of a red zone. The district currently has no active Covid-19 cases. Last month the district was in the news when two Thai nationals who were part of the New Delhi religious conference tested positive on March 21. “Every single case we had in Erode was asymptomatic,” Erode deputy director of Health Services Dr S Soundammal told HT.The district has not seen a single positive case since April 15 entirely due to rigorous contact tracing in the initial days with testing and strict quarantining that followed. “Our last active case was recorded on April 14 after which we have not got a single case. This is despite 100-200 samples tested every day still,” said Soundammal. “Our happiest day was April 28 when the last of the four cases we had were discharged. That day we realised that we had not had a case for the previous fortnight.”The district administration is now focused on containing crossovers from across the district borders, even though the state has begun to allow inter-district travel. “We have got lists of people who have crossed over into our district, some who had passes to travel, some who didn’t. Some people who have walked across the Cauvery river, or through forests. We have strictly closed borders and maintained records and enforced a 14-day quarantine for anyone coming from outside,” said Soundammal. “For it to be a complete success story it will take time. We are in the middle of the journey,” she said.Flattening the curve or reducing the spread of the infection now means that a district has to find its way back to being a green zone. One way to do that is to curtail people from red zones mixing with people from other zones. However, former city health officer of Chennai and senior epidemiologist Dr P Kuganantham noted that epidemiologists are not worried about the increasing number of positive cases. “The first step to arrest the spread of the epidemic is identifying more number of cases,” he said.The more a state tests, the more the numbers would increase. Official data from May 1 shows that Chennai has tested 5225 samples per million population while the state has tested 1685 samples per million population till now.“People are alarmed about increasing number of cases but they don’t understand one important point, positivity and illness are two different things. Testing positive amongst the younger and middle age groups is not going to harm them unless they suffer from any co-morbid conditions. It is only bad if elderly people with co-morbidities are going to be infected,” he said. “This lockdown has has postponed or delayed outbursts of the epidemic, and given more chance for elderly people to be isolated.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/containment-zones-boost-chennai-s-efforts-to-efforts-to-flatten-covid-19-curve/story-O3emY2Yl73I95aoXQq6rVL.html
09-05-2020||India||Congress ups ante against ruling BJP in Gujarat as Covid cases surge||The Congress in Gujarat has upped the ante against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government, blaming the “Namaste Trump” event organised in Ahmedabad on February 24 for a surge in Coronavirus infections in the state.The opposition party demanded an independent probe by a special investigation team (SIT) into the matter, and said it will soon approach the Gujarat high court against the state government’s “criminal negligence”, since the event held during US President Donald Trump’s visit allegedly led to community transmission of the virus.Trump participated with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the February 24 road show in Ahmedabad that was witnessed by thousands of people.After the road show, the two leaders addressed a gathering of more than 100,000 people at Motera cricket stadium, run by the Gujarat Cricket Association. Till Friday, Gujarat reported 7,403 Covid-19 cases, of which 5,260 were from Ahmedabad district alone. Of the 449 people who died due to the disease in the state, 343 were from the city.At least 204 patients have died in Ahmedabad’s Civil Hospital, while 92 died at Sardar Vallabhbhai Hospital.“We will soon file a petition in the Gujarat high court demanding a judicial inquiry into the event through an SIT having field experts as its members,” said Gujarat Congress chief Amit Chavda.“We will demand action against the government, GCA and the Trump Abhivadan Samiti (a committee formed to organise the event) through this petition,” he added.Chavda alleged the Coronavirus entered Gujarat and spread among people due to the Namaste Trump event as thousands of foreigners came to Ahmedabad ahead of the US president’s visit.“People were asked to stand shoulder to shoulder on the road to greet the leaders. Lakhs of people were brought to the stadium in buses. This triggered the spread of the virus. This event was not a mistake, but criminal negligence,” he said.The World Health Organization (WHO) had said in January that the coronavirus spreads from one person to another, and asked all countries to refrain from organising large gatherings, the Congress has maintained.“Despite such warning, Namaste Trump was planned for political gains and permission was granted by the Gujarat government. Because of the Namaste Trump event, not only Gujarat but the whole country is paying the price,” the party alleged.“Is it a coincidence that Ahmedabad, which hosted the event, has become one of the worst affected cities?” asked the Congress, while claiming the Gujarat model of development was a lie that has completely devastated not only the state but the entire nation.However, the Gujarat unit of the BJP dismissed the allegations as baseless, and said the event was organised well before the WHO declared Covid-19 a pandemic.“The first Coronavirus case in Gujarat was reported on March 20, almost a month after the event. Chavda is making baseless allegations for vote bank politics,” said Gujarat BJP spokesman Prashant Vala.The state government’s offer to give land within seven days and all clearances to set up industries in 15 days to firms wanting to shift out of China also faced criticism from the Congress, which accused chief minister Vijay Rupani of being insensitive towards migrant workers and the country’s small and medium businesses.“Disgusted by @vijayrupanibjp ji’s announcement of inviting foreign investors. #Gujarat govts pathetic treatment towards our #migrant workers during #coronavirus will remain a blot forever. Our #MSMEs are on death bed. Give them a stimulus package before inviting foreign Industries,” said senior Congress leader Shaktisinh Gohil.His colleague Arjun Modhwadia also attacked the chief minister.“I am happy to learn CM @vijayrupanibjp ji opens up Guj doors for Foreign investment & industries - to boost state’s economy & market. But what about local MSME dying? They need Stimulus package, relaxation in taxes. Why this step motherly behaviour Rupani ji?” he asked.The state government has also announced that new industries will not be bound by labour laws for 1,200 days (3.2 years) from the start of manufacturing, to attract foreign direct investment and local investment after the pandemic.“At present, a large number of industries and MNCs from Japan, the USA, Korea and other European nations are willing to shift their production from China to other countries. We have decided to coordinate with various Central ministries, including the external affairs ministry, and approach missions of different countries to attract such industries to Gujarat,” Rupani said in a video message.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-ups-ante-against-ruling-bjp-in-gujarat-as-covid-cases-surge/story-rJSHbsiBSzHNxRklIauAUN.html

09-05-2020||India||Covid-19: Amid pandemic, snapped internet services in Kashmir irk professionals, students||Mobile internet connectivity across all 10 districts in the Kashmir Valley has been suspended for four days amid coronavirus disease (Covid-19) lockdown restrictions, impeding the work-from-home (WFH) regimen of professionals and students attending online classes.On Wednesday, the Jammu & Kashmir (J&K) Union Territory (UT) authorities suspended mobile services during an encounter in which security forces killed Hizbul Mujahideen’s chief operational commander Riyaz Ahmad Naikoo at Beighpora in south Kashmir.Protests had erupted in Pulwama when the encounter was underway, prompting the authorities to suspend all mobile services -- except postpaid Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited connectivity – across the Valley. Although mobile call services were restored on Saturday,internet connectivity remained suspended.Employees of software development companies, who have been struggling with slow internet speeds since January, are among the worst hit.“Most of my team members have been working from home due to the ongoing lockdown restrictions. But the suspension of mobile internet services has disrupted their work. How can they work from home?” asked Majid Ahmad, a Srinagar-based administrator of a software development firm.The J&K administration restored 2G mobile internet connectivity in January after a Supreme Court order, as normal life in the Kashmir Valley was paralysed after the Centre revoked the special status of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir on August 5 and split it into two Union territories -- J&K and Ladakh.The administration has ignored growing demands for 4G mobile internet connectivity and only allowed 2G as a stop-gap arrangement.“I was out of Kashmir last time when the mobile internet connectivity was suspended. Now, I’m stuck here for the past two months because of the lockdown. I’m feeling helpless,” said Gowhar Ahmad, who works for an international development agency. “The suspension of internet defeats the WFH concept ...{which is } being promoted across the world amid the Covid-19 outbreak,” he added.Mohammad Asim, an engineering student who returned home from Uttar Pradesh after his college closed due to Covid-19 outbreak, cannot attend online classes because of the suspension of mobile internet connectivity.“Earlier, slow connectivity was a challenge. Now, there is no connectivity at all. How can I attend my online classes with zero connectivity?” he asked.A resident of Srinagar’s Old City, who didn’t wish to be named, said the UT administration should have suspended mobile internet connectivity only in areas such as Pulwama where protests erupted.“Why have the authorities put the entire population in Kashmir Valley at such an inconvenience amid the lockdown restrictions?” he asked.Pandurang K Pole, divisional commissioner, Kashmir, said the authorities had been compelled to suspend mobile internet connectivity because a spurt of violence in the valley. “Mobile internet connectivity has been suspended as a precautionary measure for a temporary period. We’ll restore it soon,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-amid-pandemic-snapped-internet-services-in-kashmir-irk-professionals-students/story-gvnxwrDTov0bSQ58vNbWTO.html
09-05-2020||India||Tamil Nadu to ease lockdown restrictions in Chennai, other parts from May 11||Tamil Nadu announced on Saturday the easing of a host of restrictions beginning May 11, allowing 33% workforce to return to offices in Chennai, 24x7 petrol pumps on state and central highways and opening of tea-shops (except those in containment zones) across the state, even as the government moved the Supreme Court against the Madras high court’s Friday order to close all state-run liquor outlets.The state, which recorded 600 new cases on Friday, taking the total number of Covid-19 cases to 6009, has been hit by yet another spike in cases after a vegetable and fruit wholesale market in Chennai was declared as a hotspot. At least 1589 positive cases are now linked to the Koyembedu market cluster.However the cabinet met on May 2 and discussed ways in which activities can resume in the state under the guildelines offered by the union ministry of home affairs.Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageStarting Monday, shops selling essentials goods like vegetables and groceries will open from 6 am to 7 pm within Chennai corporation limits, while they will be permitted to stay open from 10 am to 7pm in the rest of the state. Similarly, standalone and neighbourhood shops will remain open from 10.30am to 6pm in Chennai, and 10 am to 7pm in the rest of the state. Tea shops can operate in all parts of the state, except within containment zones, however, customers would not be allowed to remain within the shops. Petrol pumps in Chennai region will be open from 6 am to 6 pm; but they will operate 24X7 on central and state highways. Private offices in Chennai region can operate with 33% workforce from 10.30 am to 6 pm. The government order did not specify if public transportation would be allowed in the state, but added that all restrictions and exemptions specified earlier would continue.The state has categorized 12 districts, including Chennai, as red zones while the remaining 26 are orange zones.The state had announced the opening of liquor shops run by Tamil Nadu State Marketing Corporation (TASMAC), a government firm which sells alcohol in the state, in all districts except Chennai on Thursday. Heavy rush was witnessed at most places with people standing in serpentine queues even as the move to allow sale of liquor came in for flak from opposition parties and others, who raised apprehensions that it would lead to further spread of the novel coronavirus.However, a division bench of the high court took note of long queues and assembly of large crowds outside liquor shops, and ordered the closure of alcohol vending outlets in Tamil Nadu till the lifting of lockdown. The court observed that about 3,850 shops across the state were opened, and a record sale of Rs 175 crore was made.“It is also reported that the number of police personnel being infected with Covid-19 disease is also on the rise and deploying them for controlling the crowded tipplers before the TASMAC shops would also put their life at risk, besides preventing them from discharging their duties in places, where their services are really required”, the High Court had observed.TASMAC on Saturday moved the Supreme Court challenging the order for closure of state-run liquor outlets on the ground that there was total violation of guidelines meant to contain the Covid-19 pandemic.witnessed at most places with people standing in serpentine queues even as the move to allow sale of liquor came in for flak from opposition parties and others, who raised apprehensions that it would lead to further spread of the novel coronavirus.However, a division bench of the high court took note of long queues and assembly of large crowds outside liquor shops, and ordered the closure of alcohol vending outlets in Tamil Nadu till the lifting of lockdown.

We would like to assure everyone that the company is committed to work closely with the concerned authorities in India to investigate the cause of this incident, prevent recurrence in the future, and secure the foundation for care and treatment,” it said.The company said initial investigations, prima facie, suggested that the cause of the incident on Thursday was leaking of vapour from the Styrene Monomer (SM) storage tank near the GPPS (General Purpose Poly Styrene) factory.“We are happy to confirm that the status-quo at the plant is brought under control this morning,” it said.The statement said while focusing on stabilising the plant, the company will do its best to extend all the possible support to ensure people and their families affected by this incident are taken care of.“Our teams are working day and night with the government to assess the impact of the damage caused and create concrete measures to deliver an effective care package that can be implemented immediately,” it said.A special task force has been set up to help victims and families to resolve any issues and provide necessary assistance to the bereaved families, said the company.

09-05-2020||India||5 students booked in MP for social media post on Union minister Narendra Singh Tomar||Five students including three minors were booked in Madhya Pradesh after a complaint by a Bharatiya Janata Party worker against them for a comment on social media about Union rural development minister Narendra Singh Tomar, police said. The complainant said that the comments “insulted a reputed person and could create law and order issues.”Though the FIR was registered against the students on Sunday last but the incident came to the fore on Friday when a group of students and some social activists launched a campaign against the police station in Morena in the Gwalior-Chambal region to quash the FIR. No arrests have been made so far in the case. The students’ post reportedly questioned the way that the Union minister wore a face mask during a meeting held through video conferencing. “They posted a screen image of Tomar on Facebook and wrote, “This is the way a mask is worn. One should learn from the minister. Pls make him understand this is mask not knickers’, said an officer of the police station.Yash Sharma, a BJP worker and the complainant, said, “In this pandemic situation, these comments hurt the sentiments of people. A comparison of mask with knickers is insulting for such a reputed personality, his followers and other people.”Morena, superintendent of police, Asit Yadav said, “We received a complaint at Porsa police station in Morena on May 3. The FIR was registered against five persons under section 505 (2) (circulating a statement which create or promote enmity, hatred or ill-will between classes), section 188 (disobedience to order promulgated by public servant) and under section 51 of disaster management act, which is in force due to Covid-19.”However, one of the students named in the FIR defended the post, saying they “just wanted to send out a message” about the correct way of wearing a face mask.“During the video conferencing held on April 24, Union minister Narendra Singh Tomar had not covered his nose properly with the mask. We just wanted to send out a message to people that this was not the correct way of wearing a face mask,” Ajay Pratap Singh said.Another student Aditya Singh Tomar who runs a local social group in Morena said that the post should not offend anyone as those involved didn’t make the comments intentionally to hurt anyone.“The post should not offend anyone. It is a humorous post by three school students and two college students (Ajay Pratap Singh and Aman Singh) who are also a part of our group. They did nothing wrong or objectionable and didn’t make comments intentionally to hurt anyone. The police action violates the right to freedom of speech. We will continue our campaign till the FIR is quashed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5-students-booked-in-mp-for-social-media-post-on-union-minister-narendra-singh-tomar/story-onRjRZRZxNUoEXvn3tTUPK.html

He did not name any state.“I humbly request our @PMOIndia Shri. Narendra Modi ji to intervene in this matter by talking to the CMs of the respective states who are not allowing these people to come back home,” Pawar said in a tweet.He did not name any state but Bengal and Union home minister Amit Shah have had a war of words over transportation of migrant workers. Shah had said the Centre was not receiving “expected support” from her government in helping migrant workers reach home. The ruling Trinamool Congress in Bengal hit back at Shah and accused him of misleading people “with lies”.The transportation of migrant workers has become a touchy issue. In Maharashtra’s Aurangabad, 16 migrant workers were run over by a goods train on Friday morning as they slept on the tracks after a long journey on foot in a desperate attempt to find transport to go back to their hometowns hundreds of kilometres away in Madhya Pradesh.In another tweet, Pawar said Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and Railways minister Piyush Goyal have assured him that arrangements are in place for sending migrant workers back to their homes.“The CM of Maharashtra has assured me of arrangements for the transportation of these workers wanting to go back to their home states. State Transport buses will be used for their travel. The Union Railway Minister has also assured of arrangements of travel by trains for the same,” Pawar said in another tweet.The NCP chief said he had spoken to Goyal about the migrant workers.“Had a telephonic conversation with Shri @OfficeofUT - Chief Minister of Maharashtra and Shri @PiyushGoyal - the Union Railway Minister regarding the issue of migrant workers,” he tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sharad-pawar-asks-pm-modi-to-speak-to-cms-not-allowing-migrants-to-return/story-5I27jA3DzITAYLwR6PKK8J.html

09-05-2020||India||‘Such rumours strengthen you’: Amit Shah on negative buzz around his health||Union home minister Amit Shah on Saturday put out a statement, ending all speculation about his health concerns and said he has no ill feelings for those who have been spreading rumours about him being unwell.In a Twitter post, Shah said in the last few days some people on social media have spread rumours about his health and some have even gone to the extent of praying for his death. “The country is currently fighting a global pandemic and as the home minister I have been preoccupied in my work till very late at night, because of which I have not been able to pay attention to such speculation,” he said.The minister went on to add that when these speculative posts were brought to his notice, he initially decided to ignore these. “…I thought let these people enjoy their imaginative stories and therefore did not issue any clarification,” he said.Shah, a former president of the BJP, said he was nudged into issuing a clarification as he was inundated by calls from lakhs of party workers and well-wishers for the last few days. Taking their concerns in mind, he decided to break his silence and address the issue.“…Therefore today I decided to clarify that I am completely healthy and not suffering from any disease,” he wrote in the statement.Taking a jibe at the social media posts that have made uncharitable remarks about his health, Shah, pointing to the Hindu way of thought, said such rumours go on to strengthen one’s health.“I hope people will stop speculating about my health and let me focus on my work and also pay attention to their own work. I am grateful to all the party workers and my well-wishers who have been calling to find out about my health,” he said.BJP president JP Nadda also condemned the rumours and crude mentions about Shah’s health. “Making crude remarks about the home minister’s health is highly condemnable. Spreading such misleading things about one’s health shows the mentality of those people. I strongly condemn this and pray to God to give wisdom to such people,” said Nadda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amit-shah-on-negative-buzz-around-his-health-such-rumours-strengthen-you/story-RoYX9dyt5G9p78cNOEZL4K.html

It’s the only human disease to be eradicated so far. A lesson we must take is: when the Earth globe europe-africa unites behind science and public health measures we can defeat diseases and protect lives and livelihoods.” #OnThisDay 40 years ago, #smallpox was made history.It's the only human disease to be eradicated so far.A lesson we must take is: when the 🌍 unites behind science and public health measures we can defeat diseases and protect lives and livelihoods. pic.twitter.com/9GgNwtI0wgSmallpox was eradicated on the back of a 10-year-old effort spearheaded by the WHO involving thousands of health workers around the world to administer half a billion vaccinations. “When WHO’’s smallpox eradication campaign was launched in 1967, one of the ways countries raised awareness about smallpox was through postage stamps – when social media like Twitter and Facebook was not even on the horizon,” World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.The stamp recognises the global solidarity in fighting smallpox and honours millions of people working together, from world leaders and international organisations to rural doctors and community health workers, to eradicate smallpox.The WHO chief said that many of the basic public health tools that were used successfully to eradicate smallpox are the same tools that have been used to respond to Ebola and Covid--19: disease surveillance, case finding, contact tracing, and mass communication campaigns to inform affected populations.The WHO is now working with many partners to develop a vaccine for Covid-19 to control the transmission of the virus, Ghebreyesus said.The UN said that the successful smallpox eradication programme yielded vital knowledge and tools for the field of disease surveillance, the benefits of vaccination and the importance of health promotion in fighting other diseases.In May 1980, the 33rd World Health Assembly issued its official declaration that “the world and all its peoples have won freedom from smallpox.”“There are many lessons to learn from the eradication of smallpox that can help fight the Covid-19 pandemic today and prepare for future pandemics,” the UN said.“The eradication of smallpox offers us hope and shows us what global solidarity can achieve,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/un-agencies-commemorate-40th-anniversary-of-smallpox-eradication-with-a-stamp/story-QKDMKJXP5rNc0ulpexhgLJ.html

He said many people have even tweeted praying for his death.“The country is currently fighting a global epidemic like corona and as I keep busy being the home minister of the country, I did not pay attention to all of this. When this came to my notice late at night, I thought that all these people should enjoy their imaginary thoughts. So I did not give any clarification.“But millions of my party workers and my well wishers have expressed a lot of concern since the last two days. I cannot ignore their concern. So I want to clarify today that I am perfectly healthy and I do not have any disease,” said Shah.The home minister expressed his gratitude to well-wishers and all party workers for showing their concern about his health.“I have no ill-will or malice towards people who have spread these rumours. Thank you to you too,” Shah added.Drawing from Hindu beliefs, Shah said it is believed that such rumours strengthen one’s health. “Therefore, I hope that all such people will leave these meaningless things and let me do my work and will also do their own work,” said the minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amit-shah-debunks-rumours-surrounding-his-health-i-am-healthy-and-not-suffering-from-any-disease/story-dchI3mhTm8cb7HBuk5hX8K.html
09-05-2020||India||‘Have 7-stage plan to bring back migrants’: Trinamool on Amit Shah’s letter||West Bengal’s ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) on Saturday rubbished Union home minister Amit Shah’s allegations that the state isn’t helping the Centre in bringing back migrant workers and accused him of spreading lies and playing politics amid an epidemic.“Amit Shah’s letter is full of outright lies. Two trains have already reached and eight more are expected to reach West Bengal in the coming three days. Overall, 80,000 people have been brought back using various means of transport,” said TMC national spokesperson and Rajya Sabha member Derek O’Brien.“Amit Shah just woke up from his 40-day sleep but when one writes a letter still in his sleep, the person gets the facts all wrong,” he said, adding the Union home minister was playing politics on the issue.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s nephew and TMC youth wing chief Abhishek Banerjee tweeted that Shah should apologise if he fails to substantiate the charges in his letter with facts.Shah told Banerjee in a letter that West Bengal was meting out “injustice” to Bengali migrant workers stranded across the country by not allowing “shramik” (worker) trains run by the railways to reach the state.In his communication, Shah also pointed out the Centre has facilitated more than 200,000 migrant workers to reach home and that workers from West Bengal are eager to return.O’Brien presented a document showing two trains each from Punjab and Tamil Nadu and three from Karnataka are in the draft schedule of special trains as of May 8, and they will reach seven districts of West Bengal with 12,714 passengers between May 10 and 12. Another train is scheduled to arrive in Malda district on May 10 with 1,721 passengers from Telangana.“We have a seven-stage plan to bring back migrants. We are doing it in a staggered manner. We did not announce a lockdown without an iota of planning. We don’t want to bring back the migrant workers without a proper plan as we are considering all possible implications to find the best way to do it,” O’Brien said. The opposition Congress, however, contended the West Bengal government gave the green light to the eight trains only after receiving Shah’s letter.“The chief minister has given permission to eight more trains after Shah wrote to the state,” said Congress’ leader in the Lok Sabha, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, who is the MP from Berhampore in West Bengal. Chowdhury earlier said he had spoken with Shah and railway minister Piyush Goyal to ensure the safe return of migrant workers but his efforts hit a roadblock due to West Bengal’s lack of interest. O’Brien rubbished Chowdhury’s charge and said, “Our government gave permission to these trains before Shah’s letter, as is evident from the date in the document I presented.”Shah’s letter to the West Bengal chief minister stated, “Migrants from West Bengal are also eager to reach home. Central govt is facilitating but we are not getting expected support from W.B. State Government, which is not allowing the trains to reach W.B. This is injustice with W.B. migrant labourers. This will create further hardship for them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/have-seven-stage-plan-to-bring-back-migrants-tmc-says-after-amit-shah-s-letter/story-6GU3nspCakOuCxLZ7frjvM.html

The angry villagers stopped them and kept the bodies on the road in front of the company gate to stage a dharna.Watch | Vizag gas leak: Locals protest outside LG Polymers demanding closure of plant The police had a tough time controlling the protesters even as the force was mobilised in large numbers in view of Director General of Police Gautam Sawang’s visit to the plant.A woman protester fell on the feet of the DGP demanding justice for the people by taking immediate action against the company. However, she was taken away by the women constables posted at the spot. The DGP was escorted out of the premises with heavy police security.“It has been two days since the cases were booked against the management of LG Polymers. But no action was taken against any of the company officials till date. We shall not allow the company to run under any circumstances,” an angry villager told the reporters.With the situation getting tense, the police had to resort to lathi-charge to disperse them. They bundled scores of protesters into vans and took them away to the Gopalapatnam police station. But within no time, many others assembled at the spot and gate-crashed into the company premises.Visakhapatnam police commissioner RK Meena quickly intervened and, with the help of additional forces, managed to force the protesters out of the company premises. The police managed to shift the bodies from the spot to Venkatapuram village for cremation.State minister for tourism M Srinivasa Rao and other YSR Congress party leaders tried to convince the angry villagers, saying that the government would make efforts to see that the LG Polymers is moved out.“The government has appointed a high-powered committee to probe the accident and take stern action against the company. Please bear with us,” Srinivasa Rao appealed to the villagers with folded hands.The DGP told reporters that the Styrene gas leakage was under complete control and it would be neutralised by evening.“We are not here to protect anybody. The investigation has begun and we shall take action based on the investigation. There is no need for the villagers to get agitated,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/protesters-stop-ambulance-keep-bodies-on-road-demanding-vizag-plant-be-shut/story-LJqvfYnb0DjaJ8nfYxZhrN.html

The Indian Commissioner for Indus Waters termed the claim as “another baseless narrative” by Pakistan and said the matter has been examined. “The discharges at Akhnoor and Sidhra which are the last gauge and discharge sites on Chenab and Tawi rivers respectively in India have been found consistent and show no significant variation during the stated period,” Saxena told PTI on Friday. He added the same response has been conveyed to Pakistan advising it to get the matter examined instead.The Permanent Indus Commission, formed under the Indus Waters Treaty was signed between India and Pakistan in 1960. Indus commissioners of both the countries act as representatives of the respective governments for the treaty matters.The treaty provides for both the commissioners to meet at least once every year, alternately in India and Pakistan.It specifies that the waters of three the eastern rivers namely Ravi, Beas and Sutlej, have been allocated exclusively to India. Of the total 168 million acre-feet, India’s share of water from the three allotted rivers is 33 million acre-feet, which constitutes nearly 20 per cent. India uses 93-94 per cent of water. The western rivers, namely Indus, Chenab and Jhelum, are allocated to Pakistan with India given some rights like agriculture, navigation, domestic use and also the unrestricted rights to develop hydroelectric power projects within the specified parameters of design and operations.In March, the annual meeting between Indus Commissioners was postponed after New Delhi proposed deferment of consultations due to the coronavirus pandemic and lockdown.The Indus Commissioners are supposed to hold meeting by March 31 every year, according to the Indus Waters Treaty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/baseless-narrative-india-rejects-pakistan-s-claim-on-reduced-water-flow-in-chenab/story-aUjJeHVUCtreSsIVEAnTmI.html
09-05-2020||India||Lockdown: Karnataka allows bars, clubs, restaurants to sell liquor as takeaway||The Karnataka government has allowed restaurants, clubs and bars, which were shut since the nationwide Covid-19 lockdown began on March 25, to sell liquor at retail prices only as takeaway till May 17. Owners of restaurants, pubs and bars have welcomed the move as the state government earned record revenue due to the sale of alcohol.“We welcome this move. Since the last two months, our shop was closed due to coronavirus and we were suffering losses,” Venkatesh Babu, a bar owner, was quoted as saying by news agency ANI on Saturday.“The state government has told us to sell our stocks at the maximum retail price (MRP). It is difficult for us to do as rent for the shop and salaries are very costly,” Babu added.The order from the state’s excise department on Friday evening said that the permission is applicable to standalone CL-4 (clubs), CL-7 (hotels and lodges) and CL-9 (bar) licence holders, only till their stocks last. The takeaway of food has also been permitted.The conditions laid down by the government include the sale of sealed bottles only while maintaining social distancing during the sale and wearing of masks.Transporting liquor stocks to CL-2 (MRP) outlets is allowed, the order said adding that permission is not applicable to outlets in containment zones.The order also clarifies that procurement of fresh liquor stocks from the Karnataka State Beverage Corporation Ltd (KSBCL) depots by clubs, bars and restaurants during the period is not allowed.The permission for the sale between 9am and 7pm was given following petitions by associations of bars and hotels raising concerns that their stock would have to be destroyed if drinks such as beer which has a shelf life of six months are not sold.In a separate order, the department allowed Metro Cash and Carry to sell liquor till May 17, with similar conditions of timing, social distancing, wearing of masks among others.They too can’t operate in containment zones announced by the government.A similar order has been issued allowing standalone wine boutiques to sell wines, with similar conditions, but no last date has been set.The government had earlier allowed CL-2 (retail shops) and CL-11C (state-run retail shops such as MSIL) to sell liquor between 9am and 7pm only in areas that are outside Covid-19 containment zones from May 4.The sale of alcohol had stopped from the night of March 24 as the lockdown to check the spread of coronavirus disease took effect. After more than 40 days of lockdown, the Karnataka government had finally agreed to resume sales from May 4 but had said that only about 4,500 standalone liquor stores could sell whereas bars, restaurants and stores located in shopping complexes and malls continue to be shut to ensure adequate social distancing.Immediately after re-opening on Monday, it had sold alcohol worth Rs 45 crore.Chief minister BS Yediyurappa had announced a Rs 1,610 crore Covid-19 relief package on Wednesday and said that it would be primarily funded by a hike of 11% in excise tax. This was on top of the 6% hike which was announced in the budget presented in March indicating a cumulative 17% hike in retail prices.The state had earned Rs 19,701 crore of revenue from the sale of liquor in 2019-20—till February as the budget was presented on March 5. The revenue target from the sale of alcohol this year is Rs 22,700 crore.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lockdown-karnataka-allows-bars-clubs-restaurants-to-sell-liquor-as-takeaway/story-uCDc8p2BxSv6N6j994wW3K.html

We are taking good care of them,” Abhishek Banerjee, who is also the chief minister’s nephew, said.Amit Shah had pointed out in his letter that the Centre was not receiving the “expected support” from the state government in helping stranded migrant workers from West Bengal. “West Bengal government is not allowing trains with migrants reaching the state. This is injustice with WB migrant labourers. This will create further hardship for them,” Amit Shah had said in his letter to Mamata Banerjee.The issue of migrant workers is the latest flashpoint between the Centre and the West Bengal government amid a row over the state’s efforts to control the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The Centre and the state have exchanged allegations over the criteria for reporting deaths from the infection, and while While Bengal says the Centre is trying to politicise a public health crisis, the Union government maintains that state officials are ignoring repeated warnings to step up the fight against the disease.Federal officials have said that the region has not conducted adequate tests and that there has been mismanagement over identifying hotspots and containing them.Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla also slammed the state government for a very low rate of testing and high rate of mortality, 13.2%, by far the highest for any state. The Centre has also accused the state government of not allowing cross-border movement of goods trucks to Bangladesh.There are 1,678 Covid-19 cases and 160 deaths in West Bengal until Saturday morning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-is-lying-tmc-shoots-back-after-amit-shah-s-letter-to-mamata-banerjee-on-migrants/story-fBhv1nJDVzvVQ90CVgWUfN.html

The IMR has been reduced from 52 (2005) to 22 (2018), according to the latest data released by the Registrar General of India in the SRS bulletin on Friday. “The current national average of infant mortality rate stands at 32 much higher than that of J-K,” the spokesman said. “The entire Health and Medical Education Department with active support from the National Health Mission (NHM) has put in strenuous efforts to provide essential newborn care at government health institutions across the Union Territory,” Atal Dulloo, the financial commissioner in Health and Medical Education Department, said. Special newborn care units (SNCUs) have been established in 27 districts and other equivalent hospitals, three NICUs, newborn stabilisation units (NBSUs) and newborn care corners (NBCCs) have been set up in 264 delivery points with financial and technical support from the National Health Mission, he said. “The progress in scaling up the interventions to save the lives of the newborn has substantially accelerated during recent times leading to reduction in child mortality indicators,” Dulloo said. Some of the measures in this regard include strengthening of NICUs and SNCUs, implementation of Janani Shishu Suraksha Karyakram, hiring of manpower, etc. To further decrease the infant mortality rate in the Union Territory to single digit by 2022, an action plan has been developed which is being implemented at various levels, the spokesman said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jammu-and-kashmir-witnesses-decline-in-infant-mortality-rate/story-NgbaNFuvNfSO9mdSNdWyVI.html

This is injustice with WB migrant labourers. This will create further hardship for them,”Shah wrote.States with large migrant populations like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh have received the maximum number of workers returning home on Shramik trains.West Bengal, senior officials said, has received only two special of the special trains so far and hasn’t cleared any more trains. Until Friday, more than 250,000 migrants had been sent home on 251 Shramik trains.The issue of migrant workers is the latest flashpoint between the Centre and the West Bengal government amid a row over the state’s efforts to control the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The two sides have clashed over a visit by interministerial central teams (IMCTs) for an assessment of the situation in seven West Bengal districts.

He attacked other two cops who sustained injuries on their hands,” Mrityunjay Hiremath, senior police inspector of Marine Drive police station told HT.Night round police inspector Jitendra Kadam, sub-inspector Sachin Shelke and constable Sagar Shelke were taken to JJ hospital and after primary medication, they were taken to Marine Drive police station and given a separate room for recovery and rest.

09-05-2020||India||Covid-19: Bombay HC tells Maharashtra to protect Arthur Road jail inmates||The Bombay high court has asked the Maharashtra government to ensure that Covid-19 does not spread any further in Mumbai’s Arthur Road jail where 77 inmates and 26 staff members have tested positive for the virus.Justice Bharati Dangre’s direction came on Friday while hearing a bail application on Friday filed by an inmate, Ali Akbar Shroff, citing medical reasons.The prisoner had sought temporary bail claiming that he had become more vulnerable due to the spread of Covid-19 in Arthur Road jail.The judge said that the authorities need not be reminded of the rights of inmates to safe and healthy environment and even while in incarceration they equally enjoy the right to life as those in the outside world.Shroff’s counsel, senior advocate Abad Ponda pointed out that the 43-year-old is a chronic patient of diabetes, hyper-tension and high blood pressure. Ponda added that Shroff also has sinus problem and required constant medical treatment and supervision.This medical condition, according to the senior advocate, may prove fatal as persons suffering from hypertension and diabetes are considered more susceptible to coronavirus and therefore urged the court to release Shroff on temporary bail.“The situation no doubt is precarious,” said Justice Dangre commenting on Ponda’s statement that several inmates of Arthur Road jail have tested positive for coronavirus. “If it is true that more than 100 patients have been tested positive in Arthur Road jail, it is for the authorities to arrange for their affairs and to ensure that the inmates presently housed in the jail are not infected by the virus.”She, however, rejected the interim bail plea saying a number of aged inmates are presently languishing in jail although they are more prone to the virus, as compared to the present applicant. “Since no imminent health impediment is reflected in case of the present applicant, application is rejected,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-bombay-hc-tells-maharashtra-to-protect-arthur-road-jail-inmates/story-xCdvXCvglOLqQNXMzPWFvI.html

On one hand you are taking credit saying you are sending them back on your money & on the other hand you are asking Bihar government to return the money: Sanjay Kumar Jha, Bihar Minister https://t.co/kFvyhXg84CHowever, Jha said he has a copy of a letter sent by the Delhi government asking for the reimbursement from the Bihar government.Also read: Your service supplier with no contact history could be Covid-19 spreader इसके बावजूद दिल्ली सरकार के मंत्री @AapKaGopalRai ट्वीट के जरिए झूठ और गलतफहमी ही फैलाने पर आमादा हैं, तो क्या किया जा सकता है--सूरज में लगे धब्बा, फितरत के करिश्मे हैं। हम बारहां यह दोहरा चुके हैं कि सरकार अपने हरेक नागरिक -प्रवासी हो या निवासी- के साथ खड़ी है। #BiharModelJha took to Twitter on Saturday morning and accused Arvind Kejriwal-led Delhi government minister Gopal Rai of spreading “lies and misunderstandings through tweets”. श्रमिकों को लेकर दिल्ली से मुज़फ़्फ़रपुर, बिहार के लिए रवाना हुई ट्रेन। ट्रेन में सवार सभी 1200 लोगों का किराया देगी @ArvindKejriwal सरकार। pic.twitter.com/yzOhAMb7S7Aam Aadmi Party’s Gopal Rai, who serves as the minister of environment, development, labour & employment in Delhi cabinet, tweeted a video of 1,200 migrant labourers aboard a train departing from Delhi to Muzaffarpur on Friday. Rai, in the tweet, stated that the fare of rail tickets for all 1200 people on board will be borne by the Kejriwal government. In a series of tweets, Rai was slammed by Jha on Friday. 1/2 श्रीमान @ArvindKejriwal जी! झूठ के साथ समस्या यही है कि आप भूल जाते हैं कि कब क्या बोल चुके हैं? अब देखिए न, आपके मंत्री @AapKaGopalRai ट्विटर पर सफेद झूठ बोल रहे हैं कि दिल्ली से मुजफ्फरपुर आनेवाली ट्रेन का किराया आपकी सरकार देगी, फिर चिट्ठी भेजकर हमसे पैसे भी मांगते हैं। pic.twitter.com/qC0i0cmZbi“Honorable chief minister @NitishKumar had already made it clear that we will give additional Rs 500 to the workers in addition to the amount of the fare, so why are the Delhi government ministers lying in broad daylight?” Jha tweeted. Delhi Health Minister and AAP leader Satyendar Jain reacted to the row saying one shouldn’t indulge in politics in such matters.It is not fair to take money from them (migrant labourers), they have been staying in shelter homes for last two months. From where will they get money to pay for tickets, so the Delhi Govt paid for it. One shouldn't do politics over it: Satyendra Jain, Delhi Health Minister https://t.co/8haj3L9CYB pic.twitter.com/CKrltWyA9A“It is not fair to take money from them (migrant labourers), they have been staying in shelter homes for the last two months.

Taking to Twitter, Singh said the Delhi government had decided that it will not let the migrants pay, hence had already paid the railways by cheque. “Who are you trying to fool Nitish Kumar and BJP?” Singh tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lying-in-broad-daylight-bihar-minister-clashes-with-delhi-govt-over-rail-fare-of-migrant-workers/story-OT02GcTzOqYN26LXzrQguN.html

After the accident, the railways called for new protocols to alert train drivers about people walking on tracks. Meanwhile, the move by BJP-ruled Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh to freeze major labour laws in order to bolster businesses and revive the economy in the aftermath of the Covid-19 outbreak has drawn sharp criticism. Train crushes 16 migrants on way homeThe victims were in a group of 20 people who left Jalna for their villages the previous evening after deciding to no longer wait for their employer – a company running a steel factory – to pay their wages.These migrant workers did not have jobs, and sometimes food, for over a month as factories remained shut due to the nationwide lockdown in place to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).

09-05-2020||India||Covid-19 super spreaders: Your service supplier with no contact history could be one||Ten vegetable and fruit vendors in Jaipur, three such persons in Ahmedabad, a biryani delivery boy in Bhubaneswar and a kirana shop owner in Tuglakabad in Delhi are among the new class of Covid-19 super spreaders identified by authorities recently, with no travel history to Covid-19 hotspots. This could indicate the possibility of community transmission of the virus in the country. According to officials, the common factor in all these cases was that the source of the virus was not traceable and essential good suppliers infected many persons in their respective cities leading to a spike in the Covid-19 cases locally.As most of the spreaders were asymptomatic, their identification was a challenge for the authorities. In most of the cases, they were identified only after a large number of cases were reported from the places they had visited, officials said.Also read: List of states with over 5,000 Covid-19 cases in IndiaThese super spreaders are somewhat different from the ones identified earlier. In March and April, most of the Covid-19 super spreaders were persons with known travel history to places highly infected with Covid-19. Except of the 11 vegetable vendors in Jhajjar, the authorities have not been able to track the travel history of these service providers to a known Covid-19 hotspot.Kerala’s Wayanad, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s Lok Sabha constituency, had remained Covid-19 free for 32 days before a truck driver from Chennai’s Koyambedu vegetable market got the virus. The market, now described as a mega super spreader, has contributed to a sudden spurt in Covid-19 cases in Chennai in the last week.“The market is linked to about 1500 cases. We don’t know from where the virus came in the market,” said corporation commissioner G Prakash. This truck driver is said to have spread the virus to 20 other people including his 82-year-old mother, a 49-year-old wife and his co-driver’s 21-year-old son.Also read: Vande Bharat Mission - 8 flights from 7 countries to land in India todayIn Rajasthan, the Jaipur municipal corporation identified 10 fruit and vegetable vendors as super spreaders after they had infected at least 150 persons in the city. Jaipur has the highest number of Covid-19 cases in the state.Nineteen super spreaders including vegetable vendors, milk vendors and grocery shop workers, became the carrier for the virus in 30 new localities in Ahmedabad, which accounts for about 70% of the total cases in Gujarat.Similar instance is available from some other cities. In Odisha’s Bhubaneshwar, a biryani delivery boy is responsible for turning a residential society into a containment zone. In Lucknow’s Qaiserbagh, eight persons got the virus from a vegetable vendor, including three members of his family. In Delhi’s Tuglakabad area, a grocery shop owner became a cause for declaring the area as a containment zone. 51 persons who visited his shop were tested positive.Haryana’s Jhajjar, which had no case till April 24, got 73 Covid-19 cases from 11 vegetable sellers who visited Delhi’s Azadpur fruit and vegetable market, said to be a source for the spread of the virus in Jehangirpuri and Rohini in Delhi. Authorities have not been able to identify the Covid-19 carrier to Azadpur market. Jhajjar civil surgeon Dr Randeep Punia said they came to know these vegetable vendors only when cases started coming up from the places the sellers frequented in the town. “Identifying such persons is the biggest challenge,” said Ajitabh Sharma, Principal Secretary, department of energy and nodal officer for Covid-19 management in Jaipur. “They look normal and have no symptoms. And even if they mild symptoms, they tend to hide them fearing loss of work.”The emergence of essential service providers as Covid-19 carriers have pushed the authorities to look at a new way to check the spread without hampering supply of goods to localities.In Jaipur, Sharma said all vendors in the city are being tested and their visits have been restricted only to a few localities.“We have colour-coded their carts depending on their municipal ward to restrict their movement. Not more than 10 vendors are being allowed in a locality,” he said.Punia added that in Jhajjar, they have decided to test all those who come in contact with people frequently such as milk booth operators and shop owners. Giving daily health update on Aarogya Setu app has been made mandatory for them. Ahmedabad’s Vijay Nehra said the government has opted for home delivery of essentials as these service suppliers come in contact with a large number of people daily and it is very difficult to monitor them.Dr Rajesh Malhotra, head of Covid-19 centre at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Delhi, said the recent emergence of super spreaders show that travel history of a person is no more relevant as most of them don’t have any travel history.“We need to have a strategy to identify such persons quickly and isolate them before they spread the virus to a large number of people,” he said.Other experts, however, said that the emergence of service suppliers as Covid-19 spreaders is an ample indication of community transmission of the virus even though the government has denied it.Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan on Thursday said that India has not entered the stage three of Covid-19 transmission, which is large scale community transmission of the disease.(With inputs from state bureaus)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-covid-19-super-spreaders-your-service-supplier-with-no-contact-history-could-be-one/story-A4IPdvTqwXAlsuEad7bsTO.html

This is injustice with WB migrant labourers. This will create further hardship for them,” Amit Shah said in his letter to Mamata Banerjee.The issue of migrant workers is the latest flashpoint between the Centre and the West Bengal government amid a row over the state’s efforts to control the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The Centre and the state have exchanged allegations over the criteria for reporting deaths from the infection, and while While Bengal says the Centre is trying to politicise a public health crisis, the Union government maintains that state officials are ignoring repeated warnings to step up the fight against the disease.Federal officials have said that the region was failing to conduct adequate tests and grappling with confusion and mismanagement over identifying hot spots and containing them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/state-govt-not-allowing-trains-to-help-migrants-return-home-minister-amit-shah-writes-to-mamata-banerjee/story-0hjNS4wMFIQJ8LNO2SzIDO.html

The demand came on a day when a senior resident doctor in Goa Medical College was suspended pending further inquiry for being absent without leave when Deshprabhu was rushed to hospital requiring critical care. “As per the information gathered, two key on-duty doctors were missing when they were needed to attend Deshprabhu,” Girish Chodankar, the Congress’ Goa unit chief, said while alleging that the doctors were being protected by higher-ups.“The Congress demands an impartial inquiry by a retired high court judge on [the] mysterious death of our leader,” Chodankar said. Later, the dean of Goa Medical College and Hospital issued an order suspending the senior resident doctor. A show-cause notice has also been sent to Dr Jeevan Vernekar, the head of the radiology department.According to the show-cause notice sent to Dr Vernekar, there was a delay in conducting Deshprabhu’s CT scan at the time of his admission in GMC.It also said that when the chief medical officer accompanied Deshprabhu to the radiology department “neither a junior doctor nor senior resident doctor was present there to do the CT scan and the patient had to wait for 35 minutes.”The Goa Association of Resident Doctors has, however, protested the suspension of the doctor. In a statement to the media, the association said the decision to place the doctor on suspension was “demoralizing and demotivating to the serving residents of the institution who are already overburdened and overstressed working as frontline warriors in the ongoing pandemic.”“Residents support this institution in fighting this pandemic, but the suspension order meted against one of our senior residents is demoralizing,” the association said. Jitendra Deshprabhu, the former two-time legislator in Goa, died due to pneumonia on April 21. His test report for Covid-19 was reported negative.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-demands-probe-into-party-leader-s-death-doctor-suspended/story-E306eU3yLWSRz88ENIY08H.html

All practices should be implemented as a behavioural change. The challenge is massive, we need everyone’s support,” Agarwal added.The health ministry has also revised its guidelines for discharge of Covid-19 patients, saying only severe cases will be tested once through the real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method, after the symptoms subside. The other category of patients, including very mild, mild, pre-symptomatic and moderate cases, need not be tested before they are discharged.The revised guidelines are in complete contrast with the government’s earlier guidelines that said a case confirmed by laboratory had to be tested on day 14 once and then again in a span of 24 hours, and the patient will be fit for discharge only if both the results are negative.“After discharge from the facility, if they again develop symptoms... contact the COVID Care Centre or State helpline or 1075,” the new rules said.Globally, more than 3.9 million people have contracted the coronavirus disease and 274,898 have died, according to the Johns Hopkins tracker.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-reports-3320-new-covid-19-cases-95-deaths-in-24-hours/story-OIWepw8Z3lafz9hzkeaRIM.html

We have started an investigation,” Sanjay Dutta, inspector in charge of Dinhata police station, said while speaking to HT.“When I entered the house, I saw the child critically injured. We rushed Mithu and the baby to the hospital,” Saraswati Burman said.The neighbours heard the commotion and assembled outside the house. The e-rickshaw driver allegedly got furious and attacked them as well, said a police officer. Two villagers sustained injuries and the others thrashed Burman before handing him over to the police.Burman succumbed to his injuries at Dinhata sub-divisional hospital around 11.30am while his daughter was declared dead at 7.30am. Mithu Burman is admitted at Cooch Behar Medical College and Hospital.West Bengal allowed the sale of liquor from all standalone shops on Monday, adding an additional 30% sales tax. Since then, crowds have swelled outside liquor outlets across the state and unofficial sale figures have crossed Rs 300 crore. Bars and outlets inside shopping malls are, however, closed. The state has also allowed home delivery of liquor from the retail outlets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/drunk-e-rickshaw-driver-kills-infant-daughter-in-bengal-lynched-by-villagers/story-sbAYoCBO2F3E38tfhyYFNI.html

It is an everyday battle for us to keep the infection at bay,” Union health ministry joint secretary Lav Agarwal said on Friday.The Covid-19 national tally inches toward the 60,000 mark with over 16,000 patients who have recovered from the deadly contagion and have been discharged from hospitals. More than 1,800 people have lost their lives in the battle against coronavirus.Here’s taking a quick look at top developments:1. Five hospitals, two from Ahmedabad and one each from Chennai, Jodhpur and Bhopal, have so far been approved to conduct randomised controlled clinical trials under WHO’s Solidarity Trial to find an effective treatment for Covid-19.2. Anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine has failed another test to check its efficacy in treating the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), a new study has revealed, with patients admitted to hospitals showing no change in their conditions after being administered the medicine.3. Under its repatriation programme for nationals stranded abroad in the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak, flights carrying Indian nationals will be arriving today from Dhaka, Kuwait, Muscat, Sharjah, Kaula Lampur, London and Doha under the Vande Bharat Mission, news agency ANI reported. Two flights carrying a total of 335 people from the Gulf countries landed in Kerala’s two airports on Friday night.Under #VandeBharatMission, four flights carrying Indian nationals will be arriving — Kuwait to Cochin (arrival at 2115 hrs), Kaula Lampur to Trichy (arrival at 2140 hrs), London to Mumbai (arrival at 0130 hrs of 10th May) & Doha to Cochin (arrival at 0140 hrs of 10th May).

09-05-2020||India||Bengal Police’s order to play CM’s Covid-19 song on Tagore birth anniversary stirs controversy||Bengal Police’s order to play a coronavirus awareness song penned and set to tune by Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Rabindranath Tagore’s 159th birth anniversary has stirred a controversy. Opposition parties have called it an attempt to “impose the chief minister” on Bengal’s biggest annual cultural event. On Friday, nearly all police stations in the state took out small tableaus carrying a cut-out of Asia’s first Nobel laureate, Tagore, and played his songs over loudspeakers. The Nobel laureate in literature had also composed an opus of work consisting of more than 2,000 songs, collectively called Rabindra Sangeet which is considered as one of the most important music genres of Bengal.They also played the coronavirus awareness song, “Corona-ke Chhutey Diyo Na” which was penned by CM Banerjee at the end of March and rendered by singer-turned-minister Indranil Sen.The order from the Additional Director General of West Bengal police (law and order) is dated May 6 and was sent to the special superintendent of police of all districts and commissionerates.The order reads, “A programme titled Kabi Pranam is to be observed in districts and commissionerates on 08/05/2020 to mark the birthday of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore. A collection of selected Tagore songs is enclosed herewith, along with the awareness song, written by Hon’ble CM, WB, on coronavirus. This should be played at important residential areas and housing complexes of cities and towns between 9 am and 11.30 am.”The order added that police personnel who are “gifted with an interest in music and singing are to be encouraged and mobilised to participate, wearing safety apparel and maintaining social distancing.” “We used the celebration of Tagore’s birth anniversary to spread awareness on the coronavirus. Apart from playing Tagore’s songs, microphones were used also to remind people of the do’s and don’ts. The song on coronavirus awareness was played as part of the awareness programme,” said superintendent of police of a district, who did not want to be named, on Friday. From the price of her paintings to poetry written by her and given away by the school education department to meritorious students as ‘rewards’, CM Banerjee’s artistic expressions have often created controversies. The song about coronavirus is no exception. Senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders took digs at the Mamata Banerjee administration for issuing the order.“Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore is the greatest icon, whose teachings and wisdom guide the world. But what do Mamata Banerjee’ awareness songs have to do with celebrating Gurudev’s life and legacy? It is not just an affront to Gurdev, but also makes light of the fight against Corona!” BJP national executive member Mukul Roy said.“Instead of commemorating Gurudev, WB govt is imposing the CM on people! This is outright insulting!” alleged Bengal BJP’s women’s wing chief and Hooghly Lok Sabha MP, Locket Chatterjee.In Kolkata, CM Banerjee paid her tribute to the 19th-century polymath at a small event on the streets outside Rabindra Sadan, Kolkata’s key cultural complex, where she joined Indranil Sen and lent her voice to a Tagore song, standing in front of a cut-out of the bard. The government, which organised mega cultural celebrations across the state on this day, has created a 2-hour-long programme that will be aired by various TV channels on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-police-s-order-to-play-mamata-s-covid-19-song-on-tagore-birth-anniversary-stirs-controversy/story-iJ6Q1xk649GNtH7Fno4r6I.html

When we were cordoning off Pardhoni, the Maoists started firing. In retaliation, we also started firing. Our sub-inspector SK Sharma lost his life in Maoist firing,” Jitendra Shukla, Rajnandgaon’s superintendent of police (SP), said while speaking to HT.Sharma, a resident of Surguja district was also the in-charge of the Madanvada police station. Shukla said they have gunned down Ashok, the divisional committee member, and Krishna, who was the area committee member of CPI (Maoist).“Two other woman cadres, Sarita and Pramila, were junior cadres and working as party members,” he added.“We have also recovered an AK-47 assault rifle, one SLR and two 315 bore rifle from the spot and searching of the whole area is going on,” the SP added.Police said that the team of Maoist was camping in Pardhoni jungles since Friday evening.Rajnandgaon comes under the newly-formed zone of Maoists. Maoists have built a new red corridor on the tri-junction of three states of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh (MMC) zone. Many documents recovered suggest Maoists are continuously moving in that area to strengthen the new zone and recruitment for the area was also done.Senior officers of Chhattisgarh believe there are about 180 armed Maoists now in the Vistaar Dalam of the MMC zone, who are trying to establish their grip in the MMC zone. The new zone is said to be a refuge for hardcore Maoists of Bastar and other regions. Most of the cadres in this region were recruited from South Bastar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/policeman-killed-4-maoists-gunned-down-in-chhattisgarh-s-rajnandgaon/story-IjzdXpdj3mb1a1aiCzvTzN.html
09-05-2020||India||Plea in SC for shelter, food, transportation to migrants in view of Aurangabad accident||A plea has been filed in the Supreme Court on Friday seeking a direction to the Centre to ask all District Magistrates in the country to identify stranded migrant workers and provide shelter, food to them before ensuring their free transportation to native places in view of the early morning’s tragic incident at Aurangabad in Maharashtra in which 16 such workers were mowed down by a goods train. The migrant workers were returning to Madhya Pradesh and had slept on railway tracks. The interim application, filed in a disposed PIL, has also referred to the earlier statements made by the Centre before the apex court saying that it was told that “there was no person walking on the roads in an attempt to reach his/her home towns/villages” and moreover the states and UTs will provide adequate facilities for migrant labourers. Referring to the tragic incident, lawyer Alakh Alok Srivastava, in the plea, said, “issue appropriate direction to Union of India to show cause as to despite the Orders…passed by this court in.., why no concrete action has been taken to avert the heart wrenching train accident, which took place at Gadhejalgaon village in Aurangabad District on May 08 at about 5.30 AM (Morning) in which at least sixteen (16) migrant workers, who were walking on foot, have been Killed.” It sought a direction to the Centre to ask all district collectors to “immediately identify such moving/stranded migrant workers in their respective Districts, immediately shift them to the nearest shelter homes/camps, provide them sufficient food, water, medicines and counselling etc. and upon proper medical examination, ensure to provide free transportation to them to their respective native villages, with utmost dignity”. The plea said the deceased labourers belonged to Shahdol and Umaria Districts of Madhya Pradesh and were walking from Jalna in Maharashtra to Aurangabad Railway Station to board trains to reach hometowns. After walking for several kilometers, they decided to take rest on the railway tracks between Satana and Karmad and were mowed down by a goods train, it said. Earlier, the top court had disposed the PIL seeking migrant workers’ welfare during the pandemic and consequential lockdown saying that the Centre and states are taking appropriate steps to provide relief to migrant workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/plea-in-sc-for-shelter-food-transportation-to-migrants-in-view-of-aurangabad-accident/story-C68d66cmYSdixqdyyzqxqN.html
09-05-2020||India||After Aurangabad train accident, Maharashtra CM urges workers to not risk lives||Leaders across party lines expressed grief over the death of 16 migrant workers from Madhya Pradesh in a train accident in Maharashtra’s Aurangabad district early on Friday.Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray appealed to the migrant workers in the state to not put their lives at risk, assuring them that the government was arranging trains to ferry them to their home states.In a statement, Thackeray expressed grief over the tragedy and said that the cost of medical treatment of the injured would be borne by his government.“We are in constant touch with the Railway ministry. A train will start from Mumbai, too, soon. I appeal to workers not to put their lives at risk. The shelter camps being operated at the district level will be functional till a single migrant labourer is left in the state. Administration is looking after their stay, food and health services. The labourers will be informed about the trains at their shelters,” he said.His remarks came shortly after 16 workers were crushed to death by a freight train when they were sleeping on railway tracks.The Maharashtra government has also announced the ex gratia of ~5 lakh each to the families of the deceased from the chief minister’s relief fund.Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar reiterated the CM’s assurance. He said that a dialogue with other state departments is on and arrangements will be made soon.Sharad Pawar, president of the Nationalist Congress Party, said that factory owners and contractors should take the responsibility of the workers. “They should at least inform the government, if they are not in position to do so. The state government should constitute flying squads for these workers to ensure their safety,” he said in a statement.Calling it “heart wrenching”, Maharashtra governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari said, “The news of the unfortunate death of the innocent workers, who were sleeping on railway tracks and were run over by a goods train, is heart wrenching.”Opposition leader, and former chief minister, Devendra Fadnavis took to Twitter to express his condolences. “Extremely saddened & shocked to know about the #Aurangabad rail accident where migrant labourers lost their lives,” he tweeted.However, Bharatiya Janata Party leader Ram Kadam said that the migrant labourers were forced to walk due to the failure of the government to make arrangements for them.Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has also announced a financial assistance of ~5 lakh each to the families of the deceased. “I am also in touch with Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray to get updates about the treatment and other arrangement being made for them,” he said.(With Agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-aurangabad-train-accident-maharashtra-cm-urges-workers-to-not-risk-lives/story-mqdkLRdq8Ktz9v5CXWlmIK.html
09-05-2020||India||Ensuring safety of migrants key policy challenge for govt||On Labour Day, 38 days after a nationwide lockdown was announced, the first train ferrying migrants ran from Lingampally in Telangana to Hatia in Jharkhand. As the country trudges back to the new normal, a critical policy challenge will be to ensure the safety of the millions of migrants returning home. The preparation to safely transport migrants across the country will require data-driven decisions and an understanding of the arduous circumstances that await them and their families.We already know that migrants will go back from urban industrial hubs to their homes in rural areas. In this article, we stitch together several different data sets to understand the characteristics of their home districts and some potential challenges that await them.A majority of the return migration will likely originate from districts in red zones (hot spots). Therefore, returnee migrants are at a higher risk of being carriers of infection.To approximate the districts migrants will potentially return to, we rely on the most recent data available from the National Sample Survey, 2007-08. We use data on both interstate seasonal migrants and recent migrants who moved for economic reasons.Since most of the return migration is expected to be geographically concentrated, we focus on the top 25% districts in the country that are most likely to receive migrants (Chart 1). These are the migrants’ home districts. These districts accounted for almost three-fourths of the migrant-sending households in the country. Over 78% of these districts were in six states: Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh. The characteristics of migrants’ home districts will predominately reflect the socioeconomic profile of these states.More than 60% of the home districts are in red and orange zones, where the Covid-mitigation measures are still mostly in place . But a significant containment challenge remains for unaffected and recovered districts (green zones), which make up 39% of the home districts. As migrants return from severely affected districts to their home districts concentrated in the northern and eastern parts of the country, practising strict self-isolation will be critical to limit the spread of the virus. Self-isolation will require the luxury of physical space for quarantine.Isolating oneself may not be a trivial endeavour for returnee migrants: a typical household in the home districts has 5.9 members in contrast to 4.6 members in other districts.Besides, more than three household members share a room, on average. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that they are also more likely to have a household member above the age of 65 years, and are therefore more susceptible to infection (Chart 2). In addition to congested homes, inadequate access to private water supply, sanitation, and hygiene infrastructure (WASH) – the first line of defence in the battle against Covid – could expose migrants, their families and communities to increased risk of infection and also make self-isolation challenging for returnee migrants. Indeed, this problem is severe in migrants’ home districts.Only 24% of households in these districts had access to a private water source in 2016 (Chart 3). While access to a private source in these districts is still higher than other districts in the country, many still lack this necessity.As many as 58% of the households in these districts practised open defecation in 2016. While the toilet coverage has increased vastly under Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, there is still a gap between access and usage.The fact that less than half of the households in migrants’ home districts may be able to comply with recommended hand-washing with soap practices further reveals their vulnerability.If these challenges translate into a rapid spread of infection, the consequences for both illness and livelihood management will be more precarious given that migrants’ home districts are poorer and less urban. Expectedly, their home districts also have a lower capacity to provide health care.For instance, the average number of government district hospitals per 10,000 people in these districts is half that of the rest of the country.Since the first lockdown announcement, stranded migrants across the country have been facing an uncertain future not only about their livelihood prospects but also about when they can see their families. As migrants prepare to return home, it is critical to acknowledge that they are likely going back to rural and more impoverished districts. That net emigration is occurring from urban and more industrialized red zone districts is, perhaps, not surprising. A large part of the net immigration will also be to the red and orange zone districts, that already have some containment measures in place. However, others will likely move back to places that have a low incidence of infection.Here, preparations to protect these populations from the unfolding threat will be critical. While avoiding interpersonal contact is in any case challenging in India, data shows that it will be especially so for migrants and their families who lack adequate housing and WASH infrastructure.Preparedness in the migrants’ home districts will be the key to restricting the risk of Covid-19 spread. Given that housing, water, or sanitation infrastructure cannot be improved overnight, the double whammy of moving to a more impoverished district and difficulty in practising social distancing highlights the need for other ingenious, quick, and contextually relevant solutions. For instance, wherever institutional quarantine is infeasible, instead of home quarantine, migrants can be asked to isolate themselves in schools or other public buildings in their home towns. Indeed, there is anecdotal evidence that returnee migrants are choosing to self-isolate for a couple of weeks before they meet their families. Furthermore, distribution of sanitiser bottles and face masks could be one quick way to respond to the inadequate water, sanitation, and hygiene infrastructure.The vast institutional infrastructure of self-help groups can play a crucial role in managing Covid-19 response in rural India, by producing cloth masks, running community kitchens, and raising awareness, for instance. Above all, home districts will need to address these issues in a way that does not lead to stigmatisation of migrants.Madhulika Khanna and Nishtha Kochhar are PhD candidates at Georgetown University.

09-05-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||This is the fiftieth instalment of a daily dispatch I started writing on March 19 – it should have been the 52nd but I took two breaks, each for a day. There were 169 cases in India when I started writing the dispatch, and three deaths (all data for March 18). The corresponding numbers, globally, were 218,863 and 8,983.Back then, the coronavirus disease was largely a Chinese and Italian affair. There were 80,928 cases in China and 3,245 deaths; and 35,713 cases in Italy and 2,978 deaths. Almost 70% of deaths, and 53% of all cases were accounted for by these two countries. There were only 9,317 cases in the US, and 171 deaths. In the UK, there were 2,626 cases, and 115 deaths.In the 52 days since, the global number of cases has increased to 3.91 million, a compound growth rate of 5.7% a day, and the global number of deaths to 270,740, a growth rate of 6.8% a day. The US now accounts for the most cases, 1.29 million, and deaths, 76,938. Spain, the UK, and France have all seen a significant number of deaths (25,000-30,000). And India now has 56,409 cases and 1,890 deaths. After 46 days of a lockdown (March 25 to May 8; the government has said the current phase will go on till May 17, although several restrictions have been eased), it is clear that the disease is yet to peak in India, although the trajectory it has followed in the country remains unique. All the numbers are from worldometers.info.The big constant between then and now is the lack of a cure for Covid-19, but we are definitely closer to one than we were 52 days ago. A vaccine may be available later this year or early next year – whether it will be accessible to all is a different question altogether; never in human history has a vaccine been developed in as short a time for a disease about which we still don’t know enough. Gilead’s remdisivir has emerged as the breakout drug for Covid-19, but it is still not evident that it is the cure (it probably isn’t).In the past 52 days, we have come to learn more about the Sars-CoV-2 virus, which causes Covid-19. It is highly infective, has a wide range of symptoms, likes clusters, and is not as fatal as some other viral infections (while the death numbers are still horrible). Most cases remain mild or entirely asymptomatic, and the disease is dangerous for people over the age of 60 years, and those with pre-existing health conditions. Many of us have even taught ourselves enough basic math to track growth rates and understand the probabilities of false positives and false negatives.We have also figured out what works – lockdowns, quarantines, sterilisation, even masks. The jury was still out on masks when I started this column, with entirely well-meaning people sharing that well-produced comic strip (it went viral) that insisted they weren’t, unless one was a health worker. We know what is safe and what isn’t.We have realised that the current cure, locking down, has a price (a big one; the Indian economy will probably shrink this year) and are desperately trying to work out a way to open up without too much risk (although it does seem a bit much to apply the old risk-return trade-off to lives). We are slowly starting to get used to the prospect of co-existing with the virus. After all, humanity has encountered pathogens through the ages – and lived to tell the tale.And we are beginning to understand that nothing will be the same again (at least till a vaccine is discovered, perhaps even after).It is arguable, but I do not think there’s been a more transformational period in the history of the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-6EtAbdK2VhcOV1iRqjpTpK.html

So, keeping in mind the public health, ban was imposed on 11 premium brands for a year.”Gupta said the ban would also help contain the spread of Covid-19 in Jharkhand, as people spit after consuming Pan Masala. “The ban will be implemented strictly in Jhakhand,” he said.Socio-economic and educational development society (SEEDS), a technical partner in state government’s tobacco control programme, executive director Deepak Mishra said Jharkhand became third state in the country after Maharashtra and Bihar that banned Pan Masala.As per the notification, 41 samples of pan-masalas of different brands, were collected from different districts of Jharkhand for lab tests during 2019-2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jharkhand-bans-11-pan-masala-brands-on-health-concerns/story-QXv1MiD7rVHSoABJOOy60J.html

We need to ease transport, working from home must be promoted and we need to decentralise agencies so if God forbid such situation arises again then life doesn’t stop. I hope government, urban planners and environmentalists become more human-centric and environment friendly.”The ‘Savdhaan India’ host is deeply concerned about sharp rise in domestic violence cases. “It has been ‘dhakha-chupa satya’ (hidden truth). In this period, these violent souls have become all frustrated and hyper active. I don’t understand how such incidents can be stopped but I strongly feel all police stations should have a dedicated wing for children and women related crime. Besides, cyber-crimes and hate crimes have also gone up. Globally we are uniting to fight a virus but unfortunately the ugly face of society has exposed. Instead of uniting we have miserably divided our society.”Sushant was supposed to shoot for two web-series both of which have been indefinitely postponed.The Cine and TV Artists Association (CINTAA) honorary secretary says, “We have to learn to live with it as this virus is not going leave soon. Lockdown was just a first step to control the spread. I hope by September-October we devised methods and designed guidelines on how to shoot with the spread around. People are working on it and foreign unions are working on guidelines as we have to start work again — with or without vaccine.”After Holi, he went to Hyderabad for day do to shoot for a film. He recalls, “I had to take a flight, be in crowded unit where touch can’t be avoided and eat outside food. It was really scary!”He is spending lockdown time with family, “Thankfully, we all were in Mumbai, my daughter left her hostel as soon the lockdown was announced. So presently my entire family is home and ‘Mil-baat kar sab kaam kar rahe hain.’ Earlier, too I used to help my wife with household chores so it’s nothing new but the good part is the kids are there supporting us. It’s a good time to bond and also test our limits of ‘shehensheelta’ (patience). This way we have learnt to appreciate homemakers who live their lives for home and family.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/hope-we-become-better-human-beings-now/story-LvTmpUerczc9siesdydyQO.html

North Bengal shares borders with the Indian states of Sikkim and Assam as well as Bangladesh, Bhutan and Nepal. The last two countries and Sikkim share borders with China.Rajendra Kumar Baid, general secretary, Cooch Behar District Chamber of Commerce and Industries has already written to chief minister Mamata Banerjee, requesting her to utilize the opportunity.“Many companies are moving out of China as they have don’t feel safe anymore. India is being seen as the next destination by some companies from Europe, USA and Japan,” said Baid.“We can invite a few companies to Cooch Behar district where around 2000 acres of government land is lying unutilized alongside the Torsha River,” said Baid. “This is what I wrote to the chief minister,” he added.“North Bengal is connected to the rest of India by rail, road and air routes. The Asian Highways Network connects north Bengal to Myanmar and other countries,” said Baid.Sanjit Saha, chairman, Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), North Bengal chapter, said, “India is now being seen as a beacon of hope by potential investors and North Bengal fits the bill. Availability of cheap land and labour makes the region an attractive destination. The CII will write to the state and the Centre. This is the time to highlight the advantages of this region before potential investors.”Niranjan Mittal, director of Siliguri-based PCM Group of Companies that has investments in many countries, said, “Though it is early to say that all companies will move their investments from China to India, the crisis at least presents an opportunity worth exploring.”“We need to ensure ease in doing business through a single window system. With the Centre trying to change its policies for eastern states, north Bengal can gain,” said Mittal.Surajit Paul, secretary, North Bengali Industries Association said, “With more than 7000 micro, small and medium industries, north Bengal has the geographical advantage of reaching out to markets in many neighbouring countries.”North Bengal development department minister Rabindranath Ghosh said, “We will provide land to the companies that invest in north Bengal. The region has a land bank and offers pleasant climatic condition. Also, there are some natural advantages for food and fruit processing and agri-based industries.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/north-bengal-s-business-groups-offer-scope-for-industries-moving-out-of-china/story-Q4QBZORGAdvZt4iv9VyjQP.html

While an Air India repatriation flight from Riyadh carrying 153 passengers, including 84 pregnant women, 22 children and four infants landed at the Kozhikode airport 8 pm on Friday night, another Air India Express flight from Bahrain with 177 passengers, including 5 infants, reached Kochi airport at 11.32 pm. Two flights had landed at Kochi and Kozhikode on Thursday from Abu Dhabi and Dubai, respectively.According to Kozhikode airport sources, the flight from Riyadh carried five people having some health issues and they would be shifted to Manjeri and Kozhikode medical college hospitals. Ten passengers from neighbouring states of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu also travelled in the flight from Riyadh, the sources said. The passengers were subjected to thermal test at the aerobridge itself before allowing them to undergo customs and immigration checks, Kozhikode airport sources said. Official sources said all the passengers would be subjected to Covid-19 rapid test at the airport before transferring them to their respective destinations by special taxis and KSRTC buses. As per the norms, all the pregnant women and children would be transported to their homes and others would be shifted to coronavirus care centres in their home districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/flights-carrying-335-evacuees-from-riyadh-bahrain-land-in-kerala/story-u8iD1EeieYhctUH4ULTroI.html
09-05-2020||India||Supreme Court advises states to initiate online sale, home delivery of alcohol||The Supreme Court on Friday refused to stop the sale of liquor across the country but took the view that states should consider its online sale or home delivery in keeping with social distancing norms.The observation by the court came on a PIL filed by a public-spirited citizen Guruswamy Nataraj who sought a stay order on the May 1 notification issued by the Centre permitting liquor vends and shops to open across the country from May 4.The petition highlighted the public health threat attached with this decision. Social distancing was given a complete go-by at some of these vends that saw unmanageable crowds. At some places in Delhi, Rajasthan, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh, police had to resort to a lathicharge.Arguing the petition, advocate J Sai Deepak told the bench that direct contact sale of liquor must stop. In case of absolute necessity alone, the Centre must consider modifying its decision to permit online sale of liquor, he added.The bench of justices Ashok Bhushan, SK Kaul and BR Gavai saw merit in the suggestion of providing liquor online but felt this decision rested with the states and not the Centre. Chhattisgarh has started online sales and Punjab has arranged for home delivery of alcoholic beverages. The option of online sale has been provided by Delhi government and in Karnataka the same was undertaken on an experimental basis, Sai Deepak told the bench.But he felt that a uniform directive must come from the Centre as an entire country under lockdown cannot afford to give social distancing a go-by. This would also negate the effect of the complete lockdown aimed at flattening the curve of the coronavirus disease, he argued.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, present during the hearing conducted through video conferencing, said the decision of the Centre does not restrict states from resorting to online sale.The matter was dismissed but the bench noted in its order, “It shall be open for the concerned state government to consider non-direct sale including online sale/home delivery of liquor to facilitate social distancing”.Liquor sales have shored up state coffers that were running dry. States have resorted to levying additional tax as high as 70% on sale of liquor but this has hardly dented demand. The petitioner told the court that there are only 70,000 licensed liquor vends in the country, which can hardly meet the demand. But the court felt that any decision on sale of liquor lay exclusively within the policy domain of the governments and for this reason it refused to tie the Centre’s hands.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-advises-states-to-initiate-online-sale-home-delivery-of-alcohol/story-7BcULVf16gmx2Fm9ouQdcJ.html
09-05-2020||India||Industry body CII says Rs 15 lakh crore package required for economic revival||The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) on Friday said the impact of a prolonged lockdown on the economy is severe and demanded a stimulus package of Rs 15 lakh crore, substantially revising its earlier estimates of Rs 4.5 lakh crore.CII president Vikram Kirloskar said the negative impact on the economy is expected to be even more significant than what the industry had previously anticipated, and that it needs to be offset by a large fiscal stimulus.“CII recommends the government to announce an immediate stimulus package of at Rs 15 lakh crore, which translates into 7.5% of GDP (gross domestic product),” he said. By the time the third phase of the lockdown ends, the economy would have lost almost two months of output, he added. India is under a lockdown situation to contain spread of Covid-19 since March 25. The lockdown is scheduled to end on May 17. Other industry associations have also asked for a large stimulus package to bring the economy back on track. While the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci) has asked for a ~10 lakh crore package, the PHD Chambers of Commerce and Industry has demanded Rs 16 lakh crore. Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (Assocham) president Niranjan Hiranandani stressed on an urgent need for a stimulus package. “NITI Aayog has proposed a Rs 10 lakh crore stimulus package and we suggested a package for Rs 14 lakh crore,” he said.While industry bodies endorsed the government’s initial response under the Prime Minister Garib Kalyan Yojana (PMGKY), they are unanimous about a large stimulus package to save both lives and livelihood. The government on March 26 announced a Rs 1.7 lakh crore package under PMGKY, about 0.8% of GDP. The welfare package was aimed at providing immediate relief to the poor by providing them three-month ration and cooking gas for free and direct cash transfer to underprivileged women, elderly people and disabled people. Since then, there have been reports of a soon-to-be-announced fiscal package for industry, but none has been. An immediate substantive stimulus is required from the government for both the poor and the industry, especially micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), CII said.“Clearly, time is running out for a fiscal stimulus package to rescue the economy. Delayed fiscal relief for enterprises reeling under the lockdown will make it harder for them to recover,” CII director general Chandrajit Banerjee said.It proposed direct cash transfers of Rs 2 lakh crore to the poor having bank accounts linked through the JAM trinity (Jan-Dhan, Aadhaar and mobile) in addition to the Rs 1.7 lakh PMGKY package.It should be ensured that the migrant labourers are kept within the purview of the proposed cash transfers, Banerjee said.CII also sought Rs 2 lakh crore immediate support in the form of additional working capital to enterprises to pay salaries and prevent job losses. The additional working capital provided by banks for the April-June wage bill should be backed by a government guarantee at 4-5% interest, it added.To support about 63 million MSMEs, CII suggested a credit protection scheme where 60-70% of the loan should be guaranteed by the government. In other words, if the borrower defaults, the government should repay the bank up to the amount it has guaranteed, so the risk to the lender is limited.The industry body proposed creation of a fund with a corpus of Rs 1.4-1.6 lakh crore that will subscribe to non-convertible debentures or bonds of corporates rated A and above.“The fund can be seeded by the government contributing a corpus of Rs 10,000-20,000 crore, with further investments from banks and financial institutions. This will provide adequate liquidity to industry, particularly stressed sectors such as aviation, tourism and hospitality,” it said.It stressed on enhanced public expenditure infrastructure to boost demand in the economy with an allocation of Rs 4 lakh crore.“The work should be initiated with the involvement of state governments, so that implementation bottlenecks can be overcome. Specifically, the spending can begin with the completion of projects that have already begun, such as roads which are stalled after 80% of the job is complete,” it said.CII also suggested an allocation of Rs 2 lakh crore to bail out state-run electricity distribution companies that have been accumulating losses and burdening the state exchequer.It demanded an allocation of Rs 2 lakh crore for bank recapitalisation is required to keep the financial sector robust so that they can meet the credit needs of the industry. “This will help public sector banks manage any surge in their NPAs (non-performing assets).”In addition, CII suggested Rs 4 lakh crore support from the subscription of government paper by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), given the fact that inflationary pressures remain muted in view of depressed demand conditions.“A lower amount of Rs 2 lakh crore can be borrowed by the government from the secondary market, so that bond yields remain moderate. Further, substantial reduction in expenditure of around Rs 4 lakh crore is possible by reducing some of the discretionary expenditure such as centrally sponsored schemes. These are some of the avenues that would finance the package,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/industry-says-15l-cr-package-required-for-economic-revival/story-FsnITZwvFtj6JgD3snq0cP.html
09-05-2020||India||Supreme Court stays Orissa HC order on migrant entry||The Supreme Court on Friday stayed an interim order of the Orissa high court which ordered that all migrant workers returning to the state test negative for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) before being allowed to board special trains, and added that the exercise be governed by guidelines put in place by the central government.The guidelines put in place by the Centre for the movement of migrants provide ample protection, the Supreme Court bench headed by justice Ashok Bhushan observed, after the Union government approached the apex court saying that the HC order effectively put in place precautions over and above the protocols set by the Union government.“We stay the interim order dated 07.05.2020. We further clarify that the stranded migrants shall be dealt with as per the order/guidelines of the Government of India dated 29.04.2020,” the Supreme Court ordered.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta told the bench, also comprising justices SK Kaul and BR Gavai, that all stranded migrants boarding the special trains were being screened and only those found asymptomatic were allowed to proceed. Assisted by advocate Kanu Agrawal, he further said that the migrants were being allowed only on the condition that they will be quarantined for the requisite time period in their home states.On April 29, the central government issued a circular permitting stranded migrant workers, students and pilgrims to travel to their homes states. The government shared a list of necessary precautions to be taken during the exercise. On May 1, the government issued an order permitting the travel of such migrants by special trains.The Centre contended that the order passed by the high court effectively mandated additional safeguards over those prescribed by the Union government and that the move can’t be allowed without hearing the central government. The bench accepted this argument.“We are of the view that the order of the Government of India dated 29.04.2020 provides ample protection. It appears that before the High Court the order of the Government of India dated 29.04.2020 and the guidelines were neither brought into the notice nor were under challenge (before the high court),” the top court said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-stays-orissa-hc-order-on-migrant-entry/story-WMKwzb29nAIFrgUJEgT5cP.html
09-05-2020||India||NCW mulls advisory on policies to aid women farmers||The National Commission for Women (NCW) conducted a virtual day-long consultation on Friday to come up with an advisory for states that would enable them to prescribe policy changes in aid of women farmers hit by the lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic. The NCW expects to issue the advisory before the kharif season begins next month, and is treating the matter as urgent since several migrants are making their way home during the lockdown. NCW chairperson Rekha Sharma told Hindustan Times that as women migrants made their way home to work in farms, policy rethinks are crucial. Present at the deliberation were officials from the union ministry of women and child development, department of agriculture, National Rural Livelihood Mission, National Bank of Agriculture and Rural Development, Indian Council of Agricultural Research, PM Kisan, National Institute of Rural Development and Panchayati Raj, as well as representatives of non-governmental organisations like the International Fund for Agricultural Development, Oxfam, and Mahila Kisan Adhikaar Manch (MAAKAM). A key point that emerged during the discussion was that while a significant number of Indian farmers are women, their access to credit facilities, subsidies and tools are limited. “Most of the land is registered in the name of male farmers, and so, the women are not eligible to apply for credit facilities and state subsidies. Even farming tools are designed for men only,” Sharma said. As a result, one suggestion that came out in the discussion was to give women farmers access to credit without interest or collateral, since many did not hold land titles and others are tenant farmers. As migrant labourers make their way home — at least 1.8 lakh have registered with states to take trains back home, but the numbers are likely several times more —the labour market is expected to become more competitive. Stakeholders at the virtual consultation suggested that home state must ensure that women get equal job opportunities. The finance ministry’s Economic Survey 2017-18 pointed to the feminisation of agriculture sector, as more women took up farm jobs, but exact numbers are unclear. While an Oxfam report pegs the number of women cultivators and agriculture labourers at 70%, a 2011 report of the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations stated that women account for 30% of the farm labour force in India. Seema Kulkarni of MAKAAM, who participated in the discussion said that in the current situation unfolding due to the Covid-9 pandemic, widows of farmers who committed suicide are vulnerable. “As the kharif season is on the way, widows are particularly vulnerable as they have not sold their harvest and so, do not have seed availability and have high credit liabilities. Loan waivers are not sanctioned, and most of them get loans through self-help groups and micro-finance which are high on interest. Loans need to be institutionalised, and quick estimates of women in need must be prepared,” she said. In January, MAKAAM had written to the Centre to provide MGNREGA job cards for women affected by farm loan suicides.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ncw-mulls-advisory-on-policies-to-aid-women/story-kw9eCY2voCtJ72rkVjYJ0I.html
09-05-2020||India||WHO reforms only after pandemic is over: India||New Delhi: India believes proposals for reforming the World Health Organization (WHO), which have been raised in light of its perceived shortcomings in tackling the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) crisis, should be taken up after the world overcomes the pandemic, people familiar with the developments said on Friday.The world community’s focus, for now, should remain on efforts to fight Covid-19, develop a vaccine and medicines and keeping intact crucial supply chains, the people cited above, familiar with thinking at the highest levels of government, said on condition of anonymity.During a virtual summit of leaders of G20 states on March 26, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had raised the issue of strengthening and reforming inter-governmental organisations such as the WHO, which he said continued to be based on the last century’s model and hadn’t adapted to deal with new challenges.But even after US President Donald Trump announced last month that he would cut funding for the WHO, the Indian government said the focus of global efforts should remain on overcoming the pandemic.“Our position is that, at this time, we should give attention to the Covid-19 crisis. Issues such as the WHO’s mandate and an investigation of its working can be taken up later, when we have dealt with the immediate issue,” said one of the people cited above.During the Prime Minister’s recent conversations with heads of state and government and in external affairs minister S Jaishankar’s discussions with his counterparts, the focus has been on combating Covid-19 and finding solutions to the worldwide crisis, the people said.“All our conversations with heads of state or government or with foreign ministers have been about how to cooperate to deal with the crisis and work together to develop vaccines and therapeutic solutions,” the first person said.“The conversations have also been about reliable supply chains that can be of use to states,” the person added.The people, however, made it clear that India wants to see the WHO’s mandate strengthened. India also wants to work with others on ways to increase the WHO’s capacity to handle pandemics and crises, they added.“These are issues we can come to when we have more breathing space to deal with them,” the person added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/who-reforms-only-after-pandemic-is-over-india/story-YU4tybLy3yOBFJvSfEPnYJ.html
09-05-2020||India||Centre says Bengal not testing enough, mismanaging Covid-19 cases||As a row between West Bengal and the Centre over the state’s efforts to control the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) escalates, officials of the Union government said on Friday that the region was failing to conduct adequate tests and grappling with confusion and mismanagement over identifying hot spots and containing them.The Centre and the state government, led by chief minister Mamata Banerjee, have exchanged allegations over the criteria for reporting deaths from the infection, and while While Bengal says the Centre is trying to politicise a public health crisis, the Union government maintains that state officials are ignoring repeated warnings to step up fight against the disease.A Union government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the state was not even conducting 250 tests daily, as mandated by the Centre for Covid-19 hotspots, while neighbouring Odisha was testing between 500 to 1,000 people every day.“The state has 540 identified containment zones and 10 districts are falling in the red zone. Instead of sharpening focus on these zones, the West Bengal administration is quibbling over the number of containment areas alleging that the Centre is overestimating such areas,” another senior Union official said, asking not to be named.The Centre holds daily review meetings with different states on their Covid-19 preparedness. On Thursday, during the meeting with West Bengal, only one state official was absent, according to a person present at the meeting. As district magistrates of the red zones did not attend the meeting, Union health minister Harsh Vardhan inquired if they would be joining at all, the person added on condition of anonymity. The lone West Bengal representative, Saumitra Mohan, MD of the National Health Mission, said he wasn’t immediately able to contact the DMs.Even as the Centre has started running special trains to send back stranded migrant workers to their states, the West Bengal government has not yet put in place any standard operating procedures (SOP) for the exercise, another official said. The issue was raised again on Thursday and Mohan was asked to convey the urgency for SOP to senior officials in the state.The Centre also pointed out that a proper door-to-door scrutiny in the containment zones was not happening in the state. There were also reports of lax rules in sealing containment zones in many areas, especially in the congested areas of north Kolkata.“We have told them that it is of vital importance to conduct tests for Surveillance for Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (SARI)/Influenza Like Illness (ILI), which should be intensified in unaffected districts and districts that have not reported cases for the last 14 days,” said a senior official.Leaders of the ruling Trinamool Congress in the state have argued that the Centre failed to send adequate numbers of Covid-19 testing kits, which resulted in low level of testing. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) maintains that there is no problem of testing kits’ supply to the state.An interministerial central team (IMCT), which visited West Bengal to assess the Covid-19 situation recently, said there were discrepancies in reporting of cases in the state. In its final status report submitted to the West Bengal government, IMCT also raised questions on the state government’s claim that it surveyed five million people.A senior Union official said that due to the lack of cooperation from the state, the central team was forced to use Google Maps to find their way to hospitals or other spots for surveillance. Despite repeated requests for a statement, Mohan did not offer any comment.Trinamool’s general secretary Partha Chatterjee, however, has accused the Centre of politicising issues and warned the Centre against mixing politics with administration at a critical juncture in the public health crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-says-bengal-not-testing-enough-mismanaging-cases/story-Em6pDNsRr3S8WYvPGCrnCJ.html
09-05-2020||India||Anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine fails another test as a Covid-19 treatment, says study||Anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine has failed another test to check its efficacy in treating the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), a new study has revealed, with patients admitted to hospitals showing no change in their conditions after being administered the medicine.The observational study published in the highly cited New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) showed that doctors reported that the use of hydroxycholoquine neither lessened the need for patients requiring breathing assistance nor the risk of death.The study said there were no potential benefits or harm from the drug, which was given to 1,376 consecutive patients in the emergency room with Covid-19 symptoms in the New York-Presbyterian Hospital and Columbia University Irving Medical Center in New York City. The NEJM study found that the risk of intubation or death was not significantly higher or lower among consecutive patients who were given hydroxychloroquine compared to those who were not given the drug. “There was no significant association between hydroxychloroquine use and intubation or death,” the study concluded.The findings come two weeks after the US Food and Drug Administration warned the public against using hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine without prescription or supervision because of reports of “serious heart rhythm problems” in patients treated with the malaria drugs.“There is still no convincing evidence for treatment. To rule out unmeasured confounding and bias, randomised-control trial evidence in larger numbers is needed, such as from multi-country solidarity trial being conducted by World Health Organization,” said Dr K Srinath Reddy, president, Public Health Foundation of India. India is among the countries testing the safety and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine as part of the solidarity trial. Observational studies aren’t considered as conclusive as randomised-controlled trials because clinicians often use several drugs and therapies to treat patients. More rigorous clinical trials are needed to establish the effectiveness of the drug, said the NEJM study, which was funded by the US National Institutes of Health.Hydroxychloroquine is the only drug approved for treating hospitalised Covid-19 patients in India, where it is given in combination with the antibiotic azithromycin. It is also being given to health care workers and people at risk of exposure as a prophylaxis for Covid-19, which leads to potentially fatal complications in some patients. The cheap and widely available drug that has been used to treat malaria for at least a century emerged as the most sought-after medicine after two preliminary trials in Covid-19 patients in China in March showed it boosted recovery and lowered the severity of Covid-19. An early study from France also showed benefit of hydroxychloroquine in 26 patients treated at French hospitals, but flaws in study design made it difficult to interpret. The studies were published in medRxiv, a pre-print website that publishes studies before peer-review to expedite access to new research.An analysis published in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine in March, however, said the “data to support the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are limited and inconclusive.”Apart from malaria, hydroxychloroquine is prescribed for rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. Several countries including India, China, France, South Korea, Italy, India and the United States are using anti-malarials to treat people severely ill with Covid-19.US President Donald Trump has touted the drug as a “game changer” in the fight against Covid-19.Anti-malarials work by decreasing the acidity in endosomes, which are compartments within cells that some viruses hijack to enter the cell and cause infection. The doorway used by Sars-Cov-2 is the spike protein on its surface that it uses to attach to a receptor on the surface of human cells, but studies in cell culture have suggested chloroquines have some activity against the virus.The doses needed to treat Covid-19 are usually very high, which raises risk of toxicities, which led a small study in Brazil being suspended after researchers found high doses led to irregular heartbeats (heart arrhythmia).Last week, Gilead Sciences’ antiviral drug remdesivir became the first drug to get emergency use authorisation in the US for treatment of Covid-19.

09-05-2020||India||Delhi HC relief to professor over maternity leave||A judgment by the Delhi High Court on Labour Day, May 1, shone the light on unfair conditions imposed upon female contractual workers after it quashed the termination order of an ad-hoc college professor who had taken maternity leave and whose tenure was not extended by her place of employment.Manisha Priyadarshani, an ad-hoc professor of English at Aurobindo Evening College since 2014, took leave between January and March 2019 for the birth of her child. Following this, her tenure, which ended on March 18, was not extended at the start of the new semester in May, although other ad-hoc professors, who were junior to her, were given extensions.As Delhi University does not entitle ad-hoc employees to avail of maternity leave and benefits, the college claimed that it was well within its rights to terminate Priyadarshani’s appointment and “her non-reporting for duty from 21.01.2019 to 18.03.2019, was improper”.Priyadarshani also moved a petition in the Delhi high court last March, challenging the 2005 Delhi University rule that denies maternity leave to ad-hoc employees, and sought benefits under the Maternity Benefits Act, 1961. This petition is still pending in court, said Kush Chaturvedi, the advocate representing her on the matter.The May 1 judgment comes in the wake of widespread agitation by ad-hoc professors for benefits as well as induction into permanent rolls of the university.According to Rudrashish Chakraborty, a former member of the Academic Council of Delhi University, the number of ad-hocs has grown to disproportionate numbers in the last few years. Since 2012, Delhi University Teachers Association (Duta) has demanded that all ad-hocs should be made permanent. It has also taken up the issue of maternity leave of ad-hoc teachers, Chakraborty, a former elected member of the Duta executive, said.“Delhi University has 50% teachers in the ad-hoc capacity — that’s 4500 teachers — and a huge number of them are women, teaching for a long time. They are given appointments for four months, which is then extended after a notional break; they don’t receive annual increments or the same kind of benefits as permanent teachers. Priyadarshani’s case is symptomatic of a larger malaise in the university system: that of apathy of the authorities towards the ad-hoc teachers and also withdrawal of any financial commitment to higher education,” he said.In its judgment, the high court found that the justification offered by the college that she was not at work when her tenure ended, as she was on leave that was not granted to someone in her capacity, was not “a legitimate ground to deny extension of tenure” to her.The court further stated that this was akin to penalising a woman for becoming a mother while still employed, and equating motherhood to loss of employment. The court held that Article 21 of the Constitution guaranteed her right to employment and protected her reproductive rights as a woman.“Such a justification offered by the respondents for declining to grant an extension to the appellant/petitioner as she had highlighted her need for leave due to her pregnancy and confinement would be tantamount to penalising a woman for electing to become a mother while still employed and thus pushing her into a choice-less situation as motherhood would be equated with loss of employment,” the order of a two-judge bench comprising Justices Hima Kohli and Asha Menon, read.Namita Rajput, officer on special study of Aurobindo College (evening), confirmed that Delhi University did not have provisions for granting maternity relief to ad-hoc teachers. On a question regarding their future course of action, Rajput said that the college was yet to decide on the matter. Though the order was passed on May 1, the college is yet to contact her regarding joining back, Priyadarshani told Hindustan Times.

09-05-2020||India||SC sets Aug 31 deadline for Babri order||The Supreme Court on Friday extended by three months the deadline to deliver the verdict in the criminal trial against LK Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi and Uma Bharti over the demolition of the Babri Masjid, as it asked special judge SK Yadav to pronounce the judgment by August 31.The top court asked the special judge to make use of video-conferencing facilities to ensure that the recording of evidence was completed and there was no inordinate delay in concluding the trial.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders are on trial for the 1992 demolition of the mosque in Uttar Pradesh’s Ayodhya. They have been charged for various offences under the Indian Penal Code (IPC), including promoting enmity between religious groups, making statements affecting national integration or which are likely to cause public mischief.“We may indicate that video conferencing facilities are available and should be used by Shri Yadav in order to complete all evidence… We extend the period to complete evidence and deliver judgment till 31st August, 2020,” the bench headed by justice Rohinton Nariman said after the special judge wrote to the court on May 6, stating that recording of evidence was yet to be completed.This will be the third time the court is setting a deadline for completion of trial in the 27-year-old case. In April 2017, the Supreme Court ordered that additional charge of criminal conspiracy under section 120B of IPC be framed against the accused leaders. BJP leader Kalyan Singh, who was the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh when the Babri Masjid was demolished and who is one of the accused in the case, was given immunity by the top court under Article 361 of the Constitution as he is currently the governor of Rajasthan. The apex court had also ordered the special court to complete the trial within two years.Subsequently, the court took up the matter in July 2019 and extended the deadline for completion of the trial and delivery of the verdict by nine months. The deadline expired on April 19 and the special judge wrote to the apex court on May 6, seeking an extension.The SC heard the matter on Friday. “We are cognizant of the fact that Shri Yadav is making all efforts in order that the trial reach a just conclusion. However, given the original time frame and the extended time frame, the effort must now be to complete the proceedings and deliver judgment latest by 31st August, 2020,” the Supreme Court said.The top court, in its landmark verdict on November 9 last year, decided the title suit on the disputed site at Ayodhya in favour of the Hindu parties, while also acknowledging that the demolition of the Babri Masjid was a “calculated act.”“During the pendency of the suits, the entire structure of the mosque was brought down in a calculated act of destroying a place of public worship. The Muslims have been wrongly deprived of a mosque which had been constructed well over 450 years ago,” the November 9 judgment said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-sets-aug-31-deadline-for-babri-order/story-mo2pVSg4Kz3Q06Jg0Os4vI.html

09-05-2020||India||LG Polymers told to pay Rs 50 crore interim relief||The National Green Tribunal on Friday asked LG Polymers Private Limited to pay Rs 50 crroe interim compensation, which has to be deposited with the district magistrate of Vishakhapatnam at the earliest. The amount was arrived at on the basis of prima facie evidence of the extent of damage to life, public health and environment according to NGT’s order which was published immediately after an emergency hearing by video conferencing.The NGT bench headed by chairperson Adarsh Kumar Goel took suo moto cognizance of the Styrene gas leak, which happened on Thursday and killed 12 people.NGT also constituted a fact finding committee comprising Justice B. Seshasayana Reddy, Former Judge, Andhra Pradesh High Court; Prof Ch V Rama Chandra Murthy, former vice chancellor, Andhra University, Vizag; Professor Pulipati King, Head of Chemical Engineering Department, Andhra University, Vizag; Member Secretary, CPCB (Online, if travel is restricted due to Covid-19); and Director, CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Technology (Online, if travel is restricted due to Covid-19) and Head, NEERI, Vizag.The committee was asked to get information on the sequence of events leading to the gas leak, causes of failure and persons and authorities responsible therefore, extent of damage to life, human and non-human; impact on public health and the environment – including on water, soil, air; steps to be taken for compensation of victims and restitution of the damaged property and environment; and the cost involved and remedial measures to prevent recurrence. CPCB was asked to bear the costs of logistics and functioning of the committee.NGT also issued notices to Andhra Pradesh State Pollution Control Board, District Magistrate, Vishakhapatnam, Central Pollution Control Board , Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change and LG Polymers India Pvt., Limited. Responses will have to be filed before the next date of the hearing on May 18.“Styrene gas is a hazardous chemical as defined under Rule 2(e) read with Entry 583 of Schedule I to the Manufacture, Storage and Import of Hazardous Chemical Rules, 1989. The Rules require on-site and off-site Emergency Plans to ensure prevention of damage. There appears to be failure to comply with the said Rules and other statutory provisions. Leakage of hazardous gas at such a scale adversely affecting public health and environment, clearly attracts the principle of ‘Strict Liability’ against the enterprise engaged in hazardous or inherently dangerous industry. Such an entity is liable to restore the damage caused under the Environment Law, apart from other statutory liability,” the bench said in its order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lg-polymers-told-to-pay-50cr-interim-relief/story-aETvfDM0f9DeOZaxWqZ29I.html
09-05-2020||India||Kailash Mansarovar yatra will now be easier||New Delhi: The Kailash Mansarovar Yatra is set to become easier and smoother for pilgrims with the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) completing a key road in Uttarakhand that will cut the travel time for the pilgrimage as people will no longer have to undertake a gruelling trek for it, the defence ministry said on Friday.Hundreds of pilgrims travel to the 6,638-metre Mount Kailash near Mansarovar Lake in the Tibet Autonomous Region annually in summer with the belief that circumambulating the holy mountain brings good fortune.The BRO has built the 80-km road from Dharchula to Lipulekh (the gateway to Kailash-Mansarovar) at an altitude ranging from 6000 feet to 17,060 feet to create the shortest route for the Yatra, the ministry said in a statement.“Now, people can drive up to Lipulekh in vehicles. They will no longer have to trek for five to six days,” said a government official. The new road is an extension of the Pithoragarh-Tawaghat-Ghatiabagarh road.Defence minister Rajnath Singh said the new road link will allow pilgrims to complete the Yatra in just one week compared to two to three weeks it took earlier. He inaugurated the road through video conferencing.“While combating Covid-19 pandemic, the BRO in Uttarakhand has connected Kailash Mansarovar route to Lipulekh pass at a ht of 17,060 ft; thus providing connectivity to border villages and security forces,” the minister said on Twitter.“The arduous trek through treacherous high-altitude terrain can now be avoided. At present, the travel to Kailash-Mansarovar takes around two to three weeks through Sikkim or Nepal routes. The Lipulekh route had a trek of 90 km and the elderly yartris faced a lot of difficulties,” the statement said.The routes through Sikkim and Nepal require the pilgrims to cover 20% of their journey on Indian roads and 80% on Chinese roads. “With the opening of the new road, this ratio has been reversed. Now pilgrims will traverse 84% land journey on Indian roads and only 16% in China,” the defence ministry said.Singh said with the crucial road link had fulfilled the decades-old dreams and aspirations of local people and pilgrims.BRO chief Lt Gen Harpal Singh said the construction of the road was a challenging task due to constant snowfall, high altitude, and extremely low temperatures -- factors that restricted the annual working season to five months.One of the biggest challenges for the BRO was to arrange a large labour force to carry out the construction of key roads and tunnels in far-flung areas as Covid-19 sweeps through the country, as reported by Hindustan Times on April 28.The BRO’s peak working season extends from May to November. Migrant workers are a key part of the BRO’s workforce involved in building strategic roads, along the country’s northern border with China, scattered across Arunachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Sikkim, Uttarakhand, and Himachal Pradesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kailash-mansarovar-yatra-will-now-be-easier/story-QHNQCNiWlUIZEI7BiWTelO.html
09-05-2020||India||Will not return as Congress chief anytime soon: Rahul Gandhi||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Friday indicated that he will not return as the party chief anytime sooner even as his active involvement in organisational matters and series of conversations with experts on the Covid-19 crisis has fuelled speculation about it.“...please read my [resignation] letter that I wrote one year ago on that issue,” he said in response to a question about his active involvement being perceived as a sign of his return as the Congress president. Gandhi resigned as the party chief last year following the party’s drubbing in the 2019 national polls. He tweeted a four-page farewell note listing the reasons why he resigned as the Congress chief on July 3 last year.In the letter, Gandhi took a dig at his party colleagues for the electoral drubbing and spoke about the lack of support to him, saying he had stood completely alone in the fight against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS).“I personally fought the Prime Minister, the RSS, and the institutions they have captured with all my being. I fought because I love India. And I fought to defend the ideals India was built upon. At times, I stood completely alone and am extremely proud of it,” he wrote.Gandhi has held interactions with Nobel Laureate Abhijit Banerjee and former Reserve Bank of India governor Raghuram Rajan over the Covid-19 crisis.Asked about these conversations, he said, “I normally interact with a lot of people. These are interesting conversations. I thought let me give the people of India a glimpse of what the experts think about the present situation. This is the basic idea of such conversations. Whatever I get to learn and understand from these conversations, I wanted to pass it on to other people. Otherwise, there is no specific strategy behind it.”Gandhi was included in former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh-led 11-member Congress Consultative Committee on the Covid-19 pandemic on April 18.Asked about his suggestion to Congress chief ministers on taxing diesel, petrol, and alcohol, Gandhi said he will leave these decisions to them. “I do not like advising chief ministers through press conferences. The rule I would say they should follow is to be compassionate, understand that India is going through a very difficult time, that there are people, who are struggling more than others, and be gentle and compassionate and loving towards everybody.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-not-return-as-congress-chief-anytime-soon-rahul/story-YZqH2QuEPlaMgw9OHigxnK.html
09-05-2020||India||5-member panel to probe styrene leak||Hyderabad: The Andhra Pradesh government on Friday constituted a five-member committee to probe into the Thursday’s gas leakage from LG Polymers’ plant in Visakhapatnam that claimed 12 lives, officials aware of the matter said.The committee will be headed by special chief secretary (environment, forests, science and technology) Neerab Kumar Prasad, they added. Special chief secretary (industries and commerce) Karikal Valaven, Visakhapatnam collector V Vinay Chand, commissioner of police R K Meena and Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board member secretary Vivek Yadav will be among its other members.The officials said the committee will inquire into causes of the leakage and verify whether the company had adhered to all safety protocols. It will study if there are long-term effects of the gas leakage on the surrounding villages and recommend proposed action to be taken against the company in case of any negligence, they added.The committee will also suggest measures to be taken by industrial units to prevent such mishaps and submit its report within a month.State industries minister Mekapati Gautam Reddy, who visited the plant and held meetings with the officials, said experts were making efforts to neutralise styrene gas at LG Polymers plant and it might take another 48 hours to do so.He said the leakage occurred during the maintenance and that production at the plant had not commenced during the Covid-19 lockdown.Chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy separately held a review meeting and directed officials to identify hazardous factories in and around Visakhapatnam located in densely populated areas. He asked them to prepare a roadmap to make Visakhapatnam a safe and risk-free city by shifting hazardous industries away from habitations.Reddy instructed officials to immediately release ex-gratia of Rs 1 crore to each of the families of the deceased, Rs 10 lakh each to patients on ventilators, Rs 1 lakh each of other patients and Rs 25,000 to those who underwent treatment.Health minister Alla Nani said the government was involved in the relief and rehabilitation measures as per the Reddy’s instructions. He said 15,00 people in five villages around the plant were evacuated and rehabilitated on a war-footing after the news of the gas leakage was received. Nani said 554 victims were shifted to hospitals and 128 of them have completely recovered. He added the other 305 include 52 infants. Nani said 121 others were being treated at private hospitals and were out of danger.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5-member-panel-to-probe-styrene-leak/story-wjvWqNp97DIZK1FCip2AcI.html
09-05-2020||India||Vizag polymer unit didn’t have environmental nod||The Union environment ministry received LG Polymers India Private Limited’s application for environmental clearance for its Visakhapatnam plant only last month and the factory was operating without it, two officials aware of the matter said on Friday, a day after a toxic gas leak from the unit left 11 people dead.“This polymer plant is a very old project (dating back to) when the EIA [environmental impact assessment] notification was not applicable. Subsequently, they did get relevant permissions from the Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board. They didn’t come to us but applied to the State Environment Impact Assessment Authority [SEIAA] for an environmental clearance in 2018. There was confusion whether they will be assessed by the state or by the environment ministry. So only last month, their application for the EC [environmental clearance] was forwarded by the State Environment Impact Assessment Authority to us and it will be considered in due course,” said Geeta Menon, joint secretary, environment ministry.She added the company had expanded the unit, which required it to seek the clearance. “Based on that notification the company applied to SEIAA, Andhra Pradesh, but the project was not appraised. The file has come to us now. We will have to look into what violations have taken place and how long they have been operating without a valid EC,” added Menon. LG did not respond to queries from Hindustan Times sent on Thursday, and again on Friday. The ministry issued a notification in March 2017 allowing the environmental appraisal of projects, which had started work or expanded beyond their capacity. Projects were allowed to apply for such post-facto clearances for six months from the notification date.Environmental clearance involves the assessment of a project on the environment and people around it.Officials said the unit was established much before EIA norms of 2006 came into force,and it may not have applied for the clearance. “There was no law for environment clearance process then. It appears that they may not have taken the EC. But these issues are still being investigated,” said CK Mishra, secretary, environment ministry. The ministry’s website says the plant violated norms by undertaking manufacturing without the clearance. A notarised affidavit by LG Polymers India Private Limited on the ministry’s website admits the plant was functioning in violation of the EIA notification as it did not have an environment clearance for manufacturing polystyrene.According to the document dated May 8, 2019, the plant obtained “consent for establishment” in 2001 and “consent for operation” in 2002 from the Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board (APPCB). Subsequently, “minor expansions” of the facility were undertaken with APPCB’s permission, the affidavit says. In all, those “minor expansions” entailed six enhancements in the plant’s capacity; for expandable polystyrene from 45 to 102 TPD and for polystyrene from 235 to 313 TPD between 2004 and 2017.The affidavit says when the company applied for the clearance for the capacity expansion to the environment ministry, it was found the unit was “operating without a valid environmental clearance” and in “violation” as per the applicable statute.Petrochemical based processing units are required to undergo the EIA as they fall under the red or a highly polluting category.“As on this date our industry does not have a valid environmental clearance substantiating the produced quantity…however we are continuing our operations with valid consent from the State Pollution Control Board,” the affidavit says. It refers to a 2017 Supreme Court judgement mandating 100% penalty for illegal operations in violation of various statutes including the Environment Protection Act. The affidavit says that the company is aware that the environmental appraisal of the project will be subject to a bank guarantee equivalent to the sum needed for the redemption management plan and natural and community resource augmentation plans.The unit was established in Vishakapatnam in 1965 by M/S Hindustan Polymers Limited, which was amalgamated with Mc Dowell and Company in 1982, according to the affidavit. Kanchi Kohli, a legal researcher at the Centre for Policy Research, said a perusal of the documents reveals the project was still under environmental appraisal or a post-facto approval when the accident happened. “This is not merely a legal problem. It poses serious life, health and livelihood risks for people and can cause irreversible environmental damage.”Kohli said the project was in operation even as its application was pending under a “violations” category, which means its social and environmental impacts were never assessed. “This brings to light a systemic problem of the environment clearance process as thousands of projects have now come before the environment ministry disclosing that they were operating without approval. Such a system, which was earlier justified as a one-time amnesty, is now proposed as a routine exercise as part of the proposed EIA 2020 amendments. This defeats the idea of precautionary principles and prior environment clearance.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vizag-polymer-unit-didn-t-have-environmental-nod/story-CSMrE8I36C3k5TTR2fVsDM.html
09-05-2020||India||AIIMS Jhajjar to treat Covid-19 positive paramilitary jawans||With more 500 central paramilitary personnel contracting the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), the government has earmarked AIIMS Jhajjar for treatment all personnel testing positive for the infection, officials familiar with the development said.The decision was taken Friday during a meeting chaired by home minister Amit Shah with the director generals of all paramilitary forces – the Border Security Force (BSF), Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), Indo-Tibet Border Police (ITBP), Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) and Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB).The number of total positive cases in paramilitary forces touched 530 Friday with 30 new cases reported in BSF and 12 in ITBP. The BSF now has the highest number of Covid-19 cases at 221, followed by 161 in CRPF, 94 in ITBP, 35 in CISF and 17 in SSB. A CISF jawan, deployed at the Indian Museum in Kolkata, succumbed to the disease Friday, taking the number of casualties to five.One of the officials cited above said all paramilitary jawans, who were hitherto referred to ITBP hospital in Noida, and Safdarjung Hospital and Ram Manohar Lohia hospital in Delhi, will be sent to AIIMS Jhajjar where a dedicated team of doctors will look after their treatment.A majority of the jawans in BSF, ITBP and CRPF have contracted the infection in Delhi while performing law and order duties, while rest of the cases have been reported from Tripura, Mumbai and Kolkata.Expressing concern over the pace of Covid-19 spread in the paramilitary forces, also called CAPFs (central armed police forces), Shah instructed all director generals to ensure that contact tracing of affected jawans and testing facilities are augmented and everyone follows the safety guidelines prescribed by the Union health ministry.Shah told the chiefs of forces that “Modi government is not only concerned over the spread of Covid-19 but is making all efforts to ensure safety, security and well-being of all CAPFs”, according to statement released by the Press Information Bureau. He also enquired about the situation regarding security personnel affected by the virus in each of the CAPFs as well as persons who were found to be asymptomatic. Shah also asked the director generals to ensure timely payment of terminal dues, including ex-gratia, insurance, etc., in case of a casualty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aiims-jhajjar-to-treat-paramilitary-jawans/story-8uemmJQEE7OyL6O1c2ys6M.html
09-05-2020||India||Kerala HC seeks govt’s response to plea against Aarogya Setu app||New Delhi: The Kerala high court on Friday sought the response of the Union government in a plea challenging its May 1 directive to make the mobile application Aarogya Setu mandatory for all persons working in government and private companies.The bench headed by justice Shaji P Chaly, however, did not stay the directive while asking the Centre to file its response by May 12. The petitioner John Daniel, who is the general secretary of the Thrissur District Congress Committee, on Thursday challenged the government’s mandate to use Aarogya Setu -- a key tool in the Union government’s bid to contain the spread of Covid-19 -- alleging that it violates the privacy and autonomy of an individual.He submitted that Aarogya setu app collects personal information of an individual without consent, contended that forcible extraction of personal information is unheard of in a democratic country, and called it an attribute of a dictatorial system.He also argued that Centre’s directive asked the state governments to proceed under Section 188 of Indian Penal Code (IPC) against anyone who does not install the app. Section 188 of the IPC states that any person who disobeys an order given by a public servant can be punished with imprisonment up to six months.“If a particular citizens disapproves the use of the same, it could be said that the information was forcibly and coercively taken from him without his consent and by inflicting fear of penal consequences. Such coercive and forcible extraction of personal information from an individual is unheard of in a democratic and republic setup and it is attribute of a dictatorial system”, the petition said.The central government launched Aarogya Setu on April 2 to disseminate information regarding Covid-19, and to collect data from individuals. It is a tracking mobile application which uses the smartphone’s GPS and Bluetooth features to track the coronavirus infection. It determines whether or not an individual has been within six feet of a Covid-19 – infected person by scanning through a database of known cases across India.On April 29, the app was made mandatory for all central government employees. On May 1, it was extended to all employees in private and public institutions.The petitioner’s contention is that the app continuously collects data of an individual once it is installed on the mobile phone. By forcing people to download the app, there is no question of consent in providing personal information, the petitioner argued.Privacy and autonomy are facets of right to life under Article 21 as per the landmark 2017 Supreme Court judgment in KS Puttaswamy matter (nine-judge bench), the petitioner submitted.“He (an individual) is forced to give away data to a system which he may or may not approve of, thereby attacking his right of informational autonomy,” the petition said.A French computer researcher -- who goes by the nom de guerre Elliot Alderson -- on Tuesday posted on social media a technical analysis of the alleged flaws of Aayogya Setu on Wednesday, saying the application has vulnerabilities that could compromise the identity and movement of the millions of Indians who use it.The Union government, which dismissed the contention, maintains said the platform is “absolutely robust, safe and secure”. Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad earlier this week said it was “a perfectly accountable platform to help in the fight against Covid-19”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-hc-seeks-govt-s-response-to-plea-against-aarogya-setu-app/story-G9tdb3M50VzZlj7c6RCc8O.html

India’s played constructive role in Afghanistan and its support for efforts for peace, reconciliation and development had figured in discussions in New Delhi on Thursday between Zalmay Khalilzad, the US special envoy for Afghanistan, and external affairs minister S Jaishankar and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval.“The US side’s expectation was that India would continue to play a positive role and India has to be a part of the process to effectively contribute to the process,” the person said.India clearly conveyed its concerns regarding a recent surge in terrorist violence in Afghanistan and the role played by Pakistan-based terror sanctuaries during the meetings with Khalilzad.Khalilzad’s short visit to India amid the Covid-19 crisis highlighted the “level of urgency” regarding the situation in Afghanistan and the discussions took in the gamut of developments in the war-torn country, including internal developments, the impact of the US-Taliban agreement and efforts aimed reconciliation between Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and his rival Abdullah Abdullah, the people said.The Indian side highlighted the threat posed to Afghanistan by terrorism and the increase in attacks by the Taliban on security forces, as well as concerns about the impact of the violence on the Afghan constitutional set-up and on minorities such as Hindus and Sikhs, the people added.At the same time, India and Iran have cooperated to combat the Covid-19 pandemic, the people said. A total of 1,142 Indians, including pilgrims from Kashmir and Ladakh and students, were repatriated from Iran while more than 1,000 Iranians have been flown back from India. The Iranian side helped arranged treatment for some 300 Indians who tested positive for Covid-19, while India has provided medical assistance and medicines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chabahar-port-helps-india-extend-aid-to-afghanistan/story-iwpOeJ9d9lTXJQ5awHEuuJ.html
09-05-2020||India||Taxing work conditions, long hours fail to deter Pune nurse||Last month, when senior nurse Rajashri Kanade was due to return home after 20 straight days of duty, reports of healthcare workers being assaulted by neighbours and random people on the streets were all over the news. The 52-year-old, who was deputed at the Sassoon general hospital’s Covid-19 intensive care unit, was worried about the reception she might receive from her housing society. The Centre eventually amended the Epidemic Diseases Act 1897 to make such acts of violence a non-bailable offence, but Kanade needn’t have worried. On her return home, residents of the housing society where she has lived for the past five years, welcomed her with a shower of flower petals and an ‘arti’. Children ran up to her and gave her hand-made greeting cards, thanking her for all the effort she has put in to fight against the coronavirus pandemic.“I was overwhelmed and couldn’t stop crying. I felt like we were one big family,” said Kanade. Of Pune’s 107 deaths, a majority have been at the Sassoon hospital, one of the three Covid-19 specific hospitals in the city. Kanade, who was working in the ICU before she returned home — she has now been deputed to the Organ Transplant unit — was required to wear the personal protective equipment (PPE), one of the most important preemptive measures to prevent the spread of the virus. Another measure hospitals are taking is to turn off the air conditioning, as according to studies, the virus is able to stay suspended on aerosols, though its virulity decreases over time.There are other limitations once the PPE, comprising a body suit, mask, headgear, gloves and shoes has been worn. Once removed, the kit cannot be re-used and must be disposed. Kanade did not eat, drink or use the washroom for at least seven hours once she wore the PPE. “The PPE kit is very heavy and it sticks to the body. It is very difficult to work when you are drenched in sweat. But after years in the job, I discipline my mind to concentrate on the work at hand. Only after I remove the kit, do I use the washroom and drink at least two litres of water,” said Kanade. She would also not eat for the duration that she was in the PPE.The patients were almost always anxious and full of fear, she said. Therefore, the first thing that the medical staff do is stay positive. They help patients relax before they begin treatment, she said. “Once we enter the ward would sing a prayer hymn, ‘Hum ko itni shakti dena’,” she said.Kanade said her family was very supportive of her work: her son Aniket dropped her and picked her up; her daughter-in-law Snehal packed her meals.“We health workers are handling a pandemic for the first time,” Kanade said. “People need to follow all the precautions laid out.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/taxing-work-conditions-long-hours-fail-to-deter-pune-nurse/story-CCoDxheYZU6TTNCiB8dOcM.html
09-05-2020||India||Focusing on menstrual care in time of Covid-19 pandemic||For the past 11 years, anganwadi worker Pushpa Devi of Dablain village in Haryana’s Jind district leaves her home at 10 am for a few days each month. Along with 10 other women, she distributes sanitary napkins to the women of the village, free of cost. All the women are members of a self help group formed in 2004 and make these napkins with cloth. Like Devi, many of the women who accompany her on her rounds are anganwadi workers who have been tasked by the state government to distribute ration from the local Integrated Child Development Services centre to beneficiaries. This has proved to be a boon for them, as their sanitary napkin rounds continue unaffected.Women’s menstrual care in India is an area of concern: most rural women are unable to use hygiene products either due to lack of awareness of products like sanitary napkins and safe practises during menstruation, or due to their inability to purchase these products. According to the 2015-2016 family health survey, 51.8% women in rural areas used unhygienic methods of protection or none at all during their menstrual cycles. The government terms sanitary napkins, including homemade ones, and tampons, hygienic methods of protection.Poonam Muttreja of the Population Fund, a non governmental organisation working in the area of gender sensitive policies on population and health said that cloth, if not used hygienically, can lead to lots of infections. “Urinary tract infections can happen if cloth is not used properly. Soap and sun, which are needed to keep the cloth hygienic, are sometimes not availed by women, as reproductive health is a private issue and women tend to hide the clothes,” Muttreja said. Lack of clean water compounds women’s health issues. The group was trained to make sanitary napkins in 2009 after a bureaucrat in the local administration initiated the effort. “We bring the material from Delhi, and unlike commercial napkins, our pads are biodegradable,” Devi said over the phone from her village. “We have even trained women in other villages to make them and even how to use them. We tell them that reusing cloth is unhygienic and can lead to infections.” The group now has a facility in the village where women can make these napkins; there, the women have uninterrupted power supply, required to operate some of the sewing machines needed to stitch the pads. During the lockdown, the women have distributed over 500 packets in their village of 5000 residents, Devi said. The group also sells napkins — each packet has six, and costs Rs 12 — to women from other villages who want to sell them in their communities. Though the work that they do is vital, anganwadi workers continue to remain at high risk as they are required to do their work without much protection. There are no protective gear at all provided to these women, and anganwadi workers either buy or make the masks that they wear. The need for protective gear have been echoed by several anganwadi associations. Concerns mounted in Jind in the last few days, as four women tested positive for Covid-19 earlier this week.Suman, secretary of Jind’s Anganwadi Association, said that the women were on duty at Nidani village, and their samples were collected. “They tested positive, and were moved to Rohtak. Though we were told later that they are not positive, without protective gear, the women [anganwadi workers] are scared to move around in the village,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/focusing-on-menstrual-care-in-time-of-pandemic/story-4xWhX7aHYSvylpz7NRmpMO.html

Though it remains unclear how the policeman’s 27-year-old wife and son got infected, Vijayanta Arya, Deputy Commissioner of Police (north-west), said that the constable had been with his family in Sonepat for 10 days until April 4, when he returned to duty in the national capital. When the constable died of the coronavirus infection on Tuesday, the Sonepat administration had got his wife, son and other family members tested for Covid-19 after his cremation. “On Friday, the test results of his wife and son returned positive. They are being looked after,” the official from Sonepat said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-days-later-wife-and-son-of-delhi-cop-who-died-of-covid-19-also-test-positive/story-y5I1DU3Su2v4GyYvYnS3QO.html
09-05-2020||India||Covid-19 update: Only severe cases to be tested before discharge, says Centre||The Union health ministry on Friday revised its discharge guidelines for coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patients, requiring only patients who had developed a severe illness or have compromised immunity to test negative through a swab test before they are allowed to leave the hospital or a care centre.The other category of patients, including very mild, mild, pre-symptomatic and moderate cases need not be tested before discharge.The revised discharge guidelines are in contrast with the government’s previous rules that said a laboratory confirmed case had to be tested on day 14 once and then again in a span of 24 hours -- if both the results are negative then the patient is fit to be discharged from the health care facility.When contacted about the revised guidelines, joint secretary, health ministry, Lav Agarwal, said: “The ministry has issued detailed guidelines as per the clinical status of the patient that should be followed.”The revised discharge policy is aligned with guidelines on the 3-tier Covid-19 health facilities and the categorization of patients based on clinical severity — mild, moderate and severe.“For mild, very mild and pre-symptomatic cases admitted to a Covid Care Facility will undergo regular temperature and pulse monitoring. Patient can be discharged after 10 days of symptom onset and if they have no fever for 3 days. There will be no need for testing prior to discharge. At the time of discharge, patient will be advised to follow the home isolation for 7 more days,” say the revised guidelines.“After discharge from the facility, if they again develop symptoms of fever, cough or breathing difficulty, he will contact the COVID Care Centre or State helpline or 1075. Their health will again be followed up through tele-conference on 14th day.”Cases clinically classified as moderate cases will undergo monitoring of body temperature and oxygen saturation. If fever resolves within three days and patient maintains saturation above 95% for the next 4 days (without oxygen support), such patient will be discharged after 10 days of symptom onset in case there is no fever without anti-fever drugs, no breathlessness and no need for oxygen. There will again be no need for testing prior to discharge, and home isolation for 7 days is suggested with close monitoring of health.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/only-severe-cases-to-be-tested-before-discharge-centre/story-CEDSmxZz77tEdgfv5VYHYK.html
09-05-2020||India||Govt expands reach of Vande Bharat mission to bring back Indians stranded abroad||India will expand its massive repatriation programme for citizens stranded abroad due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) crisis to Russia, Central Asian states and European countries such as Germany and Spain next week, people familiar with developments said on Friday.The Vande Bharat Mission, as the repatriation programme has been dubbed, has focused on neighbouring countries such as the Maldives and Bangladesh and West Asian states such as the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, which have millions of expatriates, in the first phase during May 7-14.“For the second week of the mission from May 15, we will expand the scope of repatriation to other places not covered so far, particularly Russia, Central Asian countries such as Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, and European states such as Germany, the Netherlands, France and Spain,” one of the people cited above said on condition of anonymity.There will also be flights to Ukraine and Thailand, and the focus will be on countries with large numbers of Indian students, who accounted for more than a third of the nearly 68,000 requests for repatriation received by the external affairs ministry in New Delhi from people stranded abroad.During the first week of the Vande Bharat exercise from May 7, a total of 64 flights from 12 countries are expected to land at 14 airports across India with some 15,000 people. The first two flights from the UAE arrived in Kerala on Thursday.During the second week of the repatriation programme, there will be greater use of feeder flights both outside the country and within India, the people said. For instance, feeder flights could bring Indians stranded in Latin American countries to a point in the US for a return flight to India.“The main issue is the commercial viability of the operations to ensure what Air India does is self-sustaining. The flights are being operated at cost and this is not a profit-making venture,” the person cited above said, explaining why the government opted to charge for ferrying stranded nationals back to India.Noting that the government hadn’t charged for previous evacuation flights, the person added: “In the past, evacuations were from conflict zones and in emergency situations. Now, we are talking about a repatriation of people who want to return to India.“They have the means to return. They are studying and working abroad, they will finance their own return to India at minimum cost.”The people said the cost of tickets from West Asian states, for instance, were reasonable when compared to the rates of airlines from other countries that are currently operating. The government is also trying to increase the viability of Air India’s operations by allowing people on outbound flights provided they have long-term visas or residency permits and the destination countries are willing to receive them, the people said.The external affairs ministry’s online platform, on which requests received by Indian missions from citizens wanting to return are regularly uploaded, has so far recorded a total of 67,833 requests. About 34% requests or about 22,500 were from students, 30% or nearly 16,000 from migrant workers, 9,250 from short-term visa holders whose visas had expired, more than 5,500 from people with medical emergencies or seeking treatment for terminal illnesses, more than 4,000 from stranded tourists, more than 3,000 from pregnant women and the elderly and more than 1,100 from people who wanted to return due to a death in the family.These repatriation requests were from Kerala, which topped the list with more than 25,200, Tamil Nadu, with some 6,600, Maharashtra, with about 4,300, Uttar Pradesh, with more than 3,715, Rajasthan, with more than 3,300, Telangana, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Delhi, all with more than 2,000 requests each.On Thursday, an Air India flight from Abu Dhabi to Kochi brought back 181 people, while another Air India flight from Dubai to Kozhikode returned with 182 passengers. On Friday, an Air India flight from Singapore to Delhi returned with 234 passengers, while another flight from Dhaka to Srinagar brought back 168 passengers.There will be a total of 27 flights from West Asia during the first week of Vande Bharat, including 11 from the UAE, five each from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, and two each from Bahrain, Qatar and Oman.During the same period, there will be seven flights from Bangladesh to bring back nationals to Srinagar, Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai. There will be another 14 flights from South-east Asia, including five each from Singapore and the Philippines and four from Malaysia.There will also be seven flights in the first week from four airports in the US – New York, Washington, Chicago and San Francisco, and seven more flights from London.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-expands-reach-of-vande-bharat-mission/story-ehpP6er0dLaJGMToL9hi1M.html
09-05-2020||India||Migrant workers in focus as Bihar parties stay in poll gear||The homecoming of tens of thousands of migrant workers since the Covid-19 lockdown began on March 25 and realisation that they may not be in a hurry to return to big cities outside the state for work has stirred political parties in poll-bound Bihar (the polls are likely to happen at the end of the year) into action. Bihar’s NDA government, led by Nitish Kumar of the Janata Dal United -- it was initially criticised for appearing reluctant to get its workers back; the government has maintained it was waiting for a national protocol -- is working on ways to find jobs for the returnees, a sure-fire way of ensuring heir loyalty. Thus far, around a quarter of a million people, all migrant workers, have found their way back to Bihar according to government records. “The CM has made it clear that this is the time to convert challenges into opportunities. The idea of skill mapping of returning migrants is to ensure better utilization of their services,” said JD (U) spokesperson Rajiv Ranjan, who attended a recent meeting of office-bearers of his party that was chaired the chief minister. Ranjan conceded that these workers would play a crucial role in elections.“Those who have returned or are returning are here to stay. They are not returning to their workplace for at least two years ,” said BJP MLC and former union minister Sanjay Paswan. The BJP and the JD(U) are partners in the Bihar government. Paswan added that their return is good for the ruling alliance. “A majority of them, about 75%, are from extremely backward castes, 20% are SCs/STs and barely 5% are from upper caste. The caste profile of the migrants suits us, even though they are a bit against us today because of the vacillation of the state government over their return.” But that’s solvable, he seemed to suggest. “All we need to do is to accommodate them, think about their re-employment so that there is no social unrest.”The Congress party has been quick to claim credit for the return of migrants. “From the very beginning, the Congress has been demanding that the central and state governments facilitate the return of migrant labourers to Bihar and to their respective states. But neither paid any heed,” state Congress president Madan Mohan Jha said.Experts say that a meaningful utilisation of the skills the migrants possess can help the backward state. “They are skilled to perform in primary as well as service sectors. If the government meaningfully links them with the help of financial institutions, they will make Bihar shine,” says D M Diwakar, a political expert with AN Sinha Institute of Social Studies.Shefali Roy, head of department (political science) at Patna University, says, “The announcement of the government to give Rs 1500 (500+1000) to each of them after 21 days of quarantine is a strategy to woo future voters. Memory is short so the troubles will soon be forgotten by labourers and cash will definitely soften their opinion towards the government.”“They have been instrumental in development of Maharashtra, Punjab, Delhi, Gujarat and several states. We welcome them. They are good omen for us,” said state BJP spokesperson Prem Ranjan Patel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/migrant-workers-in-focus-as-bihar-parties-stay-in-poll-gear/story-MULponYlddI5y77bzWEzxI.html

Till May 2, the number of cases in the state was 5054 . This rose to 7,403 on May 8, which means the number of cases increased by 46.47%.The number of deaths also increased by 71.37% in this period. Till May 2, there were 236 deaths; this increased to 449 on May 7.Friday saw 390 positive cases and 24 deaths . Three districts account for 88.8% of the total cases: Ahmedabad (5,260), Surat (824) and Vadodra (465). Of the 449 deaths, 343 have been reported from Ahmedabad ,38 from Surat and 31 from Vadodra. Jayanti Ravi, principal secretary (health), Gujarat said that the state has conducted more than 1 lakh tests to identify Covid-19 patients.“Till date, 1872 people have been discharged which means the recovery rate has improved by over 374% in the past one week,” Ravi added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/guj-infections-rise-by-46-47-in-a-week-covid-tally-climbs-to-7-403/story-oN8hAeEWtssuzehPtYzpFK.html
09-05-2020||India||Covid-19 update: Must learn to live with the virus to beat it, says govt||The government said on Friday that Indians needed to make behavioural changes and learn to live with the Sars-CoV-2 pathogen, which causes the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), even as it said that close to one in three patients were now free of the viral infection.In its daily briefings, the central government has previously asserted that Covid-19 necessitates a “new normal” of social distancing and heightened public health vigil, which are essential to stop the advance of the highly infectious disease. On Friday, the country reported 3,241 new cases, taking the total to 59,543 infections, according to official data provided by states.Union health ministry joint secretary Lav Agarwal said on Friday that a recent spike in cases brought down the doubling rate, the average duration in which cases rise twofold, but added that the peak of the disease can be avoided if the prescribed dos and don’ts are followed.“We will have to learn to live with the virus, for which it is important to make critical behavioural changes and incorporate all the preventive guidelines that the health ministry has been issuing on following hand hygiene, cough etiquette and social distancing measures, as part of our daily routine. It is an everyday battle for us to keep the infection at bay,” the official said.He said that with 16,539 people cured of Covid-19, according to the Centre’s data, close to one in three patients were now free of the respiratory disease. “The recovery rate shows that almost one in third infected person has recovered in India. It is a positive sign as it is increasing by the day,” Agarwal said. HT’s dashboard on Covid-19 cases, which is based on data released by states, shows that the doubling rate over the past week has reduced from close to 12 days to just above 10 days, an alarming trend.Experts say a graded exit from the national lockdown, which is scheduled to conclude on May 17, could lead to a surge in cases and the peak of the disease could hit between now and August, signalling the importance of aggressive testing and adequate social distancing to keep the disease from spiralling out of control.With average daily cases over the past week remaining close to 3,000, the government is soon expected to revise its list of “red zones”, hot spots that need special attention to contain the spread of the disease.“We are aware that at some places, the number of cases has seen an abnormal growth that has also affected the country’s overall doubling rate. States such as Maharashtra, Gujarat, Delhi, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, and Rajasthan have been reporting higher number of cases, and the Centre is in constant touch with them to assist them by providing technical guidance in implementing stricter containment measures,” Agarwal said.The number of infected cases needing critical care continued to remain low in India, with 1.1% on ventilator support, 3.2% on oxygen support and 4.7% patients undergoing treatment in intensive care units (ICUs), he added.There are 216 districts that have not reported any case so far; about 42 districts have had no fresh case in the last 28 days; and 29 districts have not reported any fresh case in three weeks.The government said that while the health care facilities were prepared to manage the current caseload, other ministries were making additional arrangements to tackle a surge in infections. “Indian Railways has converted 5,231 of its rail coaches into Covid care centres, to be stationed in 215 identified railway stations for very mild and mild cases. To avoid cross-infection, there will be separate coaches for suspected and confirmed cases. A maximum of two confirmed people can be allowed to share a cabin. As many as 85 stations will have adequate number of medical personnel available to manage the cases. There are about 2,500 doctors and 35,000 paramedical staff from the railways set-aside for Covid-19 management,” said Agarwal.The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has also secured approvals from the Covid-19 National Ethics Committee for conducting clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of convalescent plasma therapy. The research body has identified 21 sites across India to conduct the trials.“The sites include five hospitals in Maharashtra, four hospitals in Gujarat, two each in Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, and one each in Punjab, Karnataka, Telangana, and the union territory of Chandigarh,” the official said.Union health minister Harsh Vardhan on Friday interacted with the state health ministers of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Telangana to review preparedness as part of a daily exercise. He stressed on the need to increase the sampling and testing of severe acute respiratory illnesses and influenza-like illnesses in all districts to determine the exact spread of the disease. He also discussed arrangements made by these states for the quarantine of migrant workers returning to the regions from other states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/must-learn-to-live-with-the-virus-to-beat-it-says-govt/story-IarrAwLNoPijbSJhhu2CIM.html
09-05-2020||India||Some states put freeze on labour laws to get business going||Undertaking a radical set of politically controversial economic reform measures, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Madhya Pradesh (MP), two states with substantial workforces, have frozen major labour laws, except basic ones, in the hope that businesses will recoup from the blow of the Covid-19 pandemic and create more jobs on a net basis.The changes give industries more flexibility in hiring and firing employees, determining their wages, and reduce their liabilities in terms of providing employee benefits. Some economists welcomed the move for clearing structural bottlenecks, possibly leading to greater investment, creating employment opportunities for migrant workers returning home, and positioning India to be able to take advantage of disruptions in global supply chains. The move, however, also sparked intense criticism from the Opposition, particularly left parties, trade unions including those affiliated to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, and civil society activists for undermining worker rights, removing decades-old protective measures and slowly dismantle the welfare architecture. To be sure, 90% of India’s workforce, which is employed in the informal sector, won’t be affected by these changes. These apply to those who are in the organised workforce and registered firms. While the Centre has attempted a degree of changes in labour laws, there have been no moves with as wide ranging an impact as those brought about in UP and MP. UP suspended key labour laws for three years on May 6 through an ordinance, even as MP announced on May 7 it was taking a similar course to put all labour laws on hold, barring some provisions of the Factories Act, 1948, for the next 1,000 days. The move comes after the BJP held consultations with stakeholders back in April. The UP government passed the Uttar Pradesh Temporary Exemption from Certain Labour Laws Ordinance, 2020, that exempts businesses, manufacturing mostly, for three years from a gamut of labour laws barring four: the Building and Other Construction Workers Act; Workmen Compensation Act; Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act; and section 5 of the Payment of Wages Act, which mandates employers to pay timely wages, and the Maternity Benefits Act. This means that a broad range of laws will not apply. These include the Factories Act, which mandates work-hours provisions. In UP, this stood at eight hour daily shifts and 48 hours a week. Employers need not abide by it anymore. The Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 too now remains suspended in UP and Madhya Pradesh. In UP, the Act in the state covers 12 sectors that account for four-fifths of manufacturing output. The law requires 30- to 90-day notice period before retrenching “workmen”, which is a class of mainly floor workers. In the case of manufacturing units, plantations, and mines with 100 or more workmen, lay-offs also required government approval. These approvals will no longer be required. The moves by the two heartland states could be a model for other BJP-ruled states, as thousands of migrant workers head back to home states, many on foot, creating a burdening surplus labour force. Gujarat and Uttarakhand are likely to follow suit, an official said.“In order to revive economy, a total of 3000 hectares of land in the industrial estates of the (state) Gujarat will be made available from the state’s land bank and also different desk-nodal officers will be assisting incoming industries from other countries. New industries will be exempted from labour laws other than the Minimum Wages Act, Industrial Safety and Health Act, Labour Compensation Act for 1,200 days from the start of production in the state,” a Gujarat government official said.Uttarakhand labour minister Harak Singh Rawat said his state too was contemplating “similar moves” to give exemptions to industry to help them deal with losses. The moves come in the backdrop of consultations undertaken by the BJP last month. Between April 3 and 10, the BJP held discussions with four groups of stakeholders on the economy and reforms. “There are many bottlenecks we need to remove. Cost of acquiring land, and the legal and procedural delays are issues. Similarly, we need reforms in the labour sector,” Gopal Agarwal, the party’s spokesperson on economic issues said. The move has divided economists as well as the political spectrum. On one side are those who believe that archaic labour laws had greatly crippled India’s economic story. make it virtually impossible to fire employees, letting inefficient firms survive at the cost efficient ones. Stringent labour laws that apply to firms employing over 100 employees act as an incentive for smaller firms to stay small so they can escape the rules. According to the World Bank, with less restrictive laws, India could approximately add on an annual basis “2.8 million more good quality formal sector jobs”. According to a recent State Bank of India Research, the country’s labour productivity was also significantly lower than its global peers. “Even in the next decade, i.e., by 2021 it is estimated that India’s output per worker will rise to just $6,414 compared to China’s $16,698,” it said.The changes give markets a much freer hand to regulate labour demand and supply, and enhance productivity and size. They, according to one official requesting anonymity, aim to increase competitiveness of firms and improve exports, while increasing labour demand. “All along we have argued for labour reforms. We know existing laws have certainly not helped the economy. We also easily assume that existing laws are good for workers and protect them. There is no way there can be business as usual. We will have to see what are the outcomes after a year or so,” said NR Bhanumurthy of the New Delhi-based National Institute of Public Finance and Policy. Bhanumurthy said the caution he would like to apply is not to hop from “one extreme to another”. The criticism comes from those who believe that it is precisely this other extreme that has been adopted. The core concern is that the changes dilute protections, such as floor wages and work shifts. This effectively brings the “north American hire-and-fire model to the Indian hinterland economy”, said economist KR Shyam Sundar of the Xavier Labour Relations Institute, Jamshedpur. The government has approached the problem from the wrong end, Shyam Sundar said. “Labour law changes giving flexibility of labour to employers will be meaningless unless supply-side measures are designed, such as wage subsidies, cheaper capital and more access to markets because of piled-up inventory due to the lockdown.” These changes will expose workers to livelihood vulnerabilities, he said.Seven left parties, led by the Communist Party of India (Marxist) general secretary, Sitaram Yechury, have written. a letter President Ram Nath Kovind for the latter’s urgent intervention on this issue to stop “such naked savagery against the working class and the working people”. Workers are angry and trade unions have criticised the moves. “This is the worst time to make amendments to labour laws,” said CK Saji Narayana, president of the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, which is affiliated to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the BJP’s ideological parent. General secretary of the left-leaning CITU Tapan Sen said the government had “pounced upon the working class”. The country however has been easing many labour rules over time. In 2014, Prime Minister Narendra Modi took steps to restrict power of federal labour inspectors by introducing random inspections assignments to them and setting time limits for reports. Some businesses were allowed to self-audit too. Rajasthan, under a BJP government, also pushed reforms in labour laws. The government’s ambitious plan to take the 40 different central labour laws and 100 state laws and merge them into four codes is still not complete. Of these four codes, the code on wages has been cleared by Parliament. Three codes—on occupational safety and health, industrial relations and social security -- are yet to be cleared. According to experts, India will have to balance the need for businesses to grow along with maintaining labour safety nets. Bibhas Saha of the Durham University Business School argued that labour law reforms, a necessity, have been a long time coming. He however said job security needs to be replaced with the concept of income security. This implies the state’s provisioning of benefits such as unemployment allowances.

09-05-2020||India||Industry bodies urge move to boost jobs||Industry bodies have asked for a suspension of labour laws, except those dealing with minimum wages, bonus and statutory dues for two to three years; the treatment of the ongoing lockdown period as an industrial furlough (termed a lay-off according to law); and for the payment of wages in this period to be expensed under Corporate Social Responsibility activities, as ways in which the state can help Indian industry during the ongoing crisis brought about by Covid-19 and the lockdown enforced to combat its spread. The organisations also asked for allowing 50% of the workforce to join a factory to restart production . These demands were raised during a webinar between the bodies and the Union labour ministry on Friday. The latest demands come after some states relaxed labour laws to woo fresh investments even as opposition parties and trade unions erupted in protests. Uttar Pradesh moved an ordinance to bypass a host of labour laws while some others allowed longer work hours in factories. Union labour minister Santosh Gangwar read out a list of measures taken to resolve workers’ woes during the Covid-induced lockdown and said that his ministry is “sympathetic to the requirements of the industry and would try to provide all possible help”, an official present at the meeting dais on condition of anonymity.  Labour secretary Hiralal Samariya assured employers that the ministry remains “committed to provide all help” ro address problems faced by the industry bodies while protecting the interests of the workers. CII, FICCI, Assocham, Council of Indian Employers and eight other employer associations attended the meeting, days after the labour ministry interacted with trade unions. Meeting recurring expenses such as payment of wages have emerged as a key concern in some sectors. While some factories have restarted work in a limited way, others still haven’t for a variety of reasons including being located in a so-called containment zone. Which is why the industry bodies want the lockdown to be equated to what the Industrial Disputes Act, enacted in 1947, terms a lay-off: the inability of a factory to operate normally on account of a raw material or power shortage or a natural calamity. The law stipulates compensation for lay-off at “50% of the total of the basic wages and dearness allowance that would have been payable to him had he not been so laid-off”.The law also says that if the lay-off period extends beyond 45 days, no additional compensation will be paid. With the government slowly opening up more industries, the employers wanted that at least 50% of the workforce must be allowed to work to increase of goods and services to optimum level. The Centre had announced that under the PMGKY, it will pay 24% of the companies’ contribution to provident fund of eligible workers who earner less than Rs 15,000 a month and are employed in a factory that has up to 100 workers. The industry bodies want the threshold on this eased so that more workers can be covered under the scheme. Apart from seeking suspension of labour except those dealing with minimum wages, bonus and statutory dues, the bodies also want an increase in the working hours to 12 hours per day.With millions of migrant workers already returned home or keen to go back, they also asked for a programme for “return of these migrant labour to work by providing counselling to alleviate their fears on Covid-19, providing financial help for their transportation, providing free groceries for about six months,” according to a second official familiar with the happenings at the meeting. They also suggested that instead of red, orange and green zones the government should notify just containment and non-containment zones to “facilitate easy movement of workers and goods”.Achirangshu Acharya, economist with Vishwa Bharati University said, “Suspension of basic rights of the workers can lead to exploitation of workers and the government needs to be careful about such demands. As India had a high unemployment rate even before the pandemic crippled the economy, the focus should on providing jobs to maximum people, not extending working hours for a set of workers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/industry-bodies-urge-move-to-boost-jobs/story-g6VxnurBeIVXA0neKGskhK.html
09-05-2020||India||Our labour reforms help create more jobs in UP: Sidharth Nath Singh||A minister in the Uttar Pradesh cabinet with the charge of several departments, including  MSMEs, investment promotion, textile, and khadi and village industries, Sidharth Nath Singh spoke to Smriti Kak Ramachandran about migrants returning to the state, changes in labour laws, the MSME sector, and investments. Edited excepts:UP has the highest number of MSMEs, and they are the worse hit from the lockdown. What is the state doing for the sector?The MSMEs mostly want help on the credit side; a lot of steps have been taken by the state to ease things. We have waived off fixed electricity charges and are billing them only for what is being consumed. Major labour reforms have been undertaken, which allow exemptions from several labour laws for a thousand days for both the existing as well as newer companies that want to set up base in UP. We are working closely with state-level banking committees to see ensure they can get what the RBI said -- 10% extra loan on the basis of their working capital.You mentioned labour reforms, but there is a lot of criticism about making changes in the laws at this time. Won’t these make workers more vulnerable to jobs losses?I can’t understand the criticism, because it helps create more jobs in UP. Our migrant labourers are coming back from other states, so we need to create more jobs. The jobs can only come in if the industries come in. All the clauses related to minimum wages, the number of hours, safety and security measures, are intact; clauses related to child labour and bonded labour will be applicable as they were before. What was redundant, unnecessary and not required, what added to red-tapism and corruption and allowed labour inspector raj, has been taken away. And, we will ensure safety and security for the labourers.There are hundreds of thousands of workers returning to UP. Is that a cause of concern, because you have to offer them jobs and take care of their medical and other needs?Whenever we looked at creating an industrial ecosystem, we found we never had trained or semi-skilled labour. For so many years, workers were known to work outside UP. Now with so many of them returning, we have an opportunity to go for a skilling programme. Now we have skilled and semi-skilled labourers who can be deployed in many sectors provided we give them a job opportunity. It is an opportunity, not a matter of worry.You’ve been holding meetings with investors. Which are the sectors that are likely to attract them?The CM formed a task force to look into attracting investments coming in, particularly from China. Apart from me, the task force has senior bureaucrats, and we have taken the professional services of Ernst & Young. We looked at two levels of competition, first at the domestic level between states; and the second from South-East Asian countries such as Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam.We looked at various aspects -- incentives, cost of wages, production -- and improved our existing policies. The sectors that we focused on are pharmaceuticals, food processing, medical devices, electronics and automobiles. The reforms will soon be approved by the state cabinet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/our-labour-reforms-help-create-more-jobs-in-up-sidharth-nath-singh/story-AsG1V6bawfrR9iWm8FYohN.html
09-05-2020||India||Centre must give stimulus, decentralise power, says Rahul Gandhi||Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Friday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to hold regular conversations with chief ministers “not as the boss but as a colleague” to fight the Covid-19 pandemic, and called for an economic package for all sections of society -- from the poorest to large industries -- because they are all interconnected parts of the economic engine that need to be kick-started to spur demand.In his second press conference during the national lockdown (he first addressed the media on April 16), Gandhi listed eight key points that, he said, the government needed to look at immediately -- income support to the poorest households; jobs through the rural employment guarantee scheme; food security to people outside the public distribution system; income and purchase guarantees to the farmers; wage protection for MSMEs; credit and subsidies for big businesses; getting shopkeepers back to work; and helping migrant workers return home.“You have to take care of big and small businesses alike because everything is connected. If you want to start the engine, you cannot think of starting just one part of the engine. You need to create demand, put money in the system, put money in poor people’s hands, help MSMEs and make sure you are protecting some of the larger players, because these are all interconnected,” Gandhi said during an hour-long video news conference.The larger idea, he said, was to end fear psychosis surrounding Covid-19, and letting people draw confidence from how the disease is not deadly for 98-99% of the people. “People are very scared. The Prime Minister needs to dispel this fear and tell people this is a dangerous disease for just 1-2% of the population who are old and those who have diabetic and heart conditions,” Gandhi said.In a more granular description of this plan, he called for a transfer of Rs.7,500, or even Rs.5,000, to each of India’s 130 million poorest households. “It is going to cost Rs 65,000 crore, and will transform the way people are thinking about the current pandemic,” he said.About employment guarantee, Gandhi said that the 100 days of the wage employment under MGNREGA should be doubled to 200 days. For food security, he asked the government to ensure delivery of 10kg rice or wheat, 1kg pulses and 1kg sugar to every individual every month for six months; and for farmers, he asked the government to transfer Rs10,000 as Urgent Income Support to all PM-Kisan accounts, purchase all foodgrain at MSP, and remove GST on fertilizers, pesticides and agricultural equipment.For entrepreneurs and industry, he suggested that government give a Rs 1 lakh crore wage protection and Rs 1 lakh crore credit guarantee schemes, along with a six-month interest subsidy on loans. He called for similar credit guarantees to big businesses to ensure the value chain is unaffected and layoffs are avoided.Gandhi has been holding conversations with global and Indian thought leaders to discuss the Covid-19 crisis and its impact on the Indian economy. So far, he has spoken with Nobel laureate Abhijit Banerjee and former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan. Asked if these conversations and his active involvement meant he is coming back as the party chief, Gandhi said, “You please read my letter one year ago (when I stepped down). I wanted to give the people a glimpse of what the experts think about the present situation.”Calling for decentralisation for a comprehensive fight against the disease, he said the battle needs to be taken to the district level. “If we fight this in the PMO only, we will lose. The Prime Minister must devolve power. If we centralise, there will be a calamity,” Gandhi said. “The Prime Minister has to trust chief ministers who, in turn, have to trust district magistrates. The Centre should leave the call of categorising zones to them and not take decisions in Delhi... Forget about Congress-ruled states or BJP-ruled states. They are all Indian chief ministers and should be working together with the Prime Minister. If I was to advise the Prime Minister, even though it is not my place, definitely he should make calls to every chief minister in 1-2 days in a partnership-type call,” he added.Gandhi also reiterated his party’s stand on the national lockdown, asking for an exit strategy, and asserting that the lockdown does not have an “on-off switch”. “You can’t switch it off and it’s gone... It requires number of things to happen. It requires a psychological change. The government needs to understand that.”The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) said Gandhi was speaking without the right facts. “The Prime Minister has been consulting chief ministers and subject experts in dealing with the situation... The ever youthful Congress leader, who is about to complete a half century, now at least should have some wisdom and practicality,” party spokesperson Sudanshu Trivedi said. “It is very typical and characteristic of Gandhi to speak before media without studying facts. It’s not time to create controversy directly or indirectly. Instead it is time for cooperation and Gandhi should try to fight the biggest calamity in human history under the able guidance of our Prime Minister,” he added.Political analyst Chandan Gowda of the Bengaluru-based Azim Premji University agreed with Gandhi that the Covid-19 containment effort should be collaborative, decentralised and all-encompassing. “Over-centralised decision-making violates the spirit of a federal polity too,” Gowda said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-must-give-stimulus-decentralise-power-rahul/story-O72zHPpRHiRCxaobllaHCN.html
09-05-2020||India||Train operators told to spot and report to avoid deaths||A group of factory workers on a 36-hour journey by foot in Maharashtra to catch transport back to their hometown in Madhya Pradesh, fell asleep exhausted after walking along the tracks since they thought there would be no trains running, the safety regulator of the railways said on Friday, calling for new protocols for engineers and field staff to report any instance of people walking on tracks so that other trains can be warned.The victims were workers at a steel factory in Maharashtra’s Jalna. After covering 36km on Thursday, they slept on the railway tracks where they were run over in the early hours of Friday -- 16 of the 20 people in the group died on the spot, where images showed a trail of scattered luggage and food.“Apparently, the affected persons had gathered along the track under the impression that train services have been suspended due to Covid-19 lockdown. Furthermore, false sense of security may have come to their minds about there being no trains running whereas freight, parcel specials have been running from before and now migrant specials have also started plying,” chief railway safety commissioner Shailesh Kumar Pathak said in a letter to railway board chairman Vinod Yadav. HT has seen the letter. The incident brings into focus the desperation of hundreds of thousands of people who migrated to work from some of India’s most impoverished villages and towns to industrial hot spots and urban centres, but now find themselves unemployed as the country remains shut down in order to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).According to railway ministry officials, the locomotive pilot controlling the freight train tried to warn the victims when he spotted them using the train’s horn and tried to stop, but the people could not react in time and the train was not able to come to a stop.The average speed of freight trains has risen from the approximately 24 km/hr usually to more than double now as passenger train services remain suspended due to the nationwide lockdown, decongesting the railway network. A high-level inquiry headed by the Commissioner Railway Safety (South Central Circle) has been ordered to investigate the incident and arrive at the cause, the ministry said. Railways minister Piyush Goyal said in a tweet on Friday that the ministry is closely monitoring the situation and is briefing him on the steps taken in this regard. The safety commissioner said as a measure of abundant precaution, it is essential that all railway personnel connected with train operations, maintenance, and patrolling activities should immediately communicate if they spot persons walking along the track. This is so that “necessary action like caution order to all passing trains…may be taken,” the official added. The safety commissioner has instructed that a ‘caution order’ be handed out to engineers to ensure special precautions. “A ‘Caution Order’ detailing the kilometres between which such precautions are necessary, the reasons for taking such precautions, and the speed at which a train shall travel, shall be handed to the Loco Pilot at the stopping station immediately short of the place where such precautions are necessary, or at such other stations and in such manner, as prescribed under special instructions,” the letter said. According to a senior official, the railways does not consider accidents that happen due to external factors as ‘railway accidents’ and hence is not bound to provide ex gratia relief to the victim’s families. “It is provided only in accidents where the railway is involved such as derailment of trains etc,. In this case, states and the Centre are likely to provide the relief,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/train-operators-told-to-spot-and-report-to-avoid-deaths/story-EMjWSEEtZJC0bRH0h9x7fN.html
09-05-2020||India||Across the country, migrants still forced to walk thousands of miles||Migrant workers continue to walk and cycle back to their homes even as the railways last week began running special trains and some state governments deployed buses for the people stranded because of the Covid-19 lockdown.Some do not have documents needed to register for the trains; others simply do not want to wait any longer; and in still other cases, the trains themselves haven’t been approved by states that have to receive the migrant workers. Mohammad Imran, a worker, said he began walking back on Wednesday along with his pregnant wife, children and parents from Rajasthan’s Ajmer to Uttar Pradesh’s Farrukhabad, around 600 km away, as neither bus nor train was available. “If get a ride, it will be good or else we will walk. It is better to move than die hungry,” he said as he walked along the Ajmer-Jaipur highway on Friday with his family.Many people continued walking or cycling back to their homes from Gujarat, Rajasthan, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. Some of them said they started walking after being unable to register for travel on the special trains as they did not have identity documents. “I was unable to register as I do not have my Aadhaar number,” said Suraj Bhan Singh, a worker from Jharkhand in Gujarat’s Surat. Another worker, Raj Singh, in Ludhiana said he has not been able to register as the Uttar Pradesh government’s helpline number is always busy. “I have not been able to connect for a week.” Neerav Kumar carried puncture repair tools as he cycled with several other workers from Rajasthan’s Jodhpur to Uttar Pradesh. He said he had arrived in Jodhpur looking for work a day before the lockdown was imposed in March. Kumar said he was forced to try and return home as he faced possibility of starvation. “I bought this cycle for Rs 1,500 to go back. We registered on the Rajasthan government website but did not receive any response.” About 3,000 migrants assembled near the Mangalore railway station on Friday and demanded that they be sent back to their states. Similar protests were also reported from Kerala and Gujarat.Many workers have been detained from trying to cross inter-state borders ; some have tried to cross over through forests that span two states; others have tried to use boats to cross rivers. Police have launched an operation to track hundreds of workers who entered Rajasthan from Gujarat through forests.Officials have cited different reasons for the problem and said some states are slow in granting permission for the special trains. And they add that many workers do not have necessary identity documents to registrer for travel on these trains and were running out of patience as factories have not fully resumed operations.Three special trains left Karnataka for Uttar Pradesh and Bihar on Friday carrying migrants. Officials in Karnataka blamed states such as West Bengal for their reluctance in accepting the workers. “There are 18,800 people from West Bengal who want to go back, but we are yet to hear from that state,” said an official on condition of anonymity.Officials in West Bengal said they are getting workers back from the districts that were either in the orange or green zone.Bihar deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi said nobody has stopped trains coming from Karnataka or any other state. “The state government has also given consent to run eight more trains from Karnataka and many more from other states.” Bihar’s public relation department secretary, Anupam Kumar, said district magistrates have been authorised to issue e-passes to people returning on their own. The state’s principal secretary, disaster management, Prataya Amrit said the Centre has devised a protocol under which states have to issue no objection certificates to receive trains. Another Bihar government official said the states have to make arrangements for medical check-ups of the returnees and their travel back to their home districts. “Therefore, allowing so many trains at the same time would be a logistical nightmare.”Jharkhand minister Rameshwar Oraon said trains were coming daily. “We have to also make arrangements to take these workers to respective districts and provide them quarantine and medical facilities.” Madhya Pradesh’s additional chief secretary, ICP Keshri, said over 1.05 lakh workers have returned to the state and 50 more trains are expected in the next one week.As many as 2.53 lakh people have registered with the Karnataka government seeking to return mainly to Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Assam. So far, 70 special trains have ferried 82,544 migrants out of 2.5 million workers stranded in different states, according to official data. Fifteen more trains were expected to reach their destinations on Saturday. Experts said the migrants were desperate to return because they have run out of money. “A migrant worker in Surat would have had an average annual income of Rs 1,07,163 in 2019-20. It implies that a migrant worker is going to lose an absolute amount of Rs 8,930 income in a month,” said Gagan Bihari Sahu, an associate professor at the Surat’s Centre for Social Studies, who has conducted a study on the losses migrant workers faced.Dilip Ratha, chief economist for migration and remittances at the World Bank, said migrants work in insecure jobs and are the first to be hit by a crisis. “Not only they will lose jobs, they will also lose ability to send back money home,” a World Bank statement had quoted him as saying.

09-05-2020||India||Aurangabad train accident: Wages halted, victims began to walk||With a handful of clothes in their luggage and packets of rotis and chutney in a couple of lunchboxes, a group of 21 men began walking from Jalna, where they worked in a steel factory, in an attempt to find a train that would take them back to their hometowns in Madhya Pradesh. After walking for around four hours, they left the main road at Badnapur and started following the train tracks in order to avoid police pickets. After covering around 36km in 8-9 hours, according to police officials who spoke to some of the men, they were too exhausted to continue and decided to sleep on the tracks. Around 5:15am, 16 of the men were run over by a freight train.“A group of 20 stranded labourers started walking from Jalna. They decided to take rest and most of them lied on rail tracks,” superintendent of police Mokshada Patil said.Images and videos taken by people at the site showed a trail of ripped luggage bags and rotis, with the incident prompting outrage by political leaders and the National Human Rights Commission issuing a notice to the Maharashtra government.“They were not even sure of the route they had to take and decided to try their luck first at Aurangabad, then two rail junctions Manmad and Bhusawal. Had they been properly informed about the train planned from Aurangabad on Friday, they probably could have not met with the accident,” said a police officer from Karmad, asking not to be named. The spot where the men were run over falls under the Karmad police jurisdiction.According to one of the survivors, the men decided to make the journey after the contractor who arranged for their employment at a steel manufacturing unit reneged on his assurance to get them their wages on May 7. The men had not been paid in over a month due to the nationwide lockdown, one of the survivors told local media.“Our family members were distressed and wanted us to return at the earliest. We tried to get passes for the special trains but did not get any help from any of the authorities. Finally, we started around 7pm on Thursday and retired on the tracks. We were so tired that could not even discuss the risk of sleeping on the tracks,” said Virendra Singh, one of three people who slept on a clearing next to the track and survived. Singh and the others saw the goods train coming and immediately raised an alarm but it went unheard, said Patil.Later on Friday, the South Central railway in a statement said the driver had seen the sleeping men and had even tried to wake them up by honking but failed to save their lives.Across Maharashtra, as in several other states such as Rajasthan, Telangana and Karnataka, people who had migrated to these states for work are now making punishing journeys back to their hometowns and villages after being sacked due to the shutdown of the economy.In cities across Maharashtra, long queues of migrant workers have been reported in recent days outside police stations and hospitals for fitness certificates from doctors and to submit these with an identity card to police. However, some migrants alleged they were charged Rs 500 for the fitness certificate.On Thursday, the state government issued a clarification that there is no need to attach a medical certificate to the registration form required to facilitate the journey.“About 1 lakh people have reached their respective villages safely. In the next few days, it is planned that all the stranded workers in the state will reach their homes properly and there is a continuous coordination with the railways,” the CM’s office said.As per the state government of Maharashtra, the state government is running 4,729 relief camps where 428,734 migrant labourers have been given refuge with food and necessities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wages-halted-victims-began-to-walk/story-epx5KoPhk9qrYl21GE5zVI.html

In order to help such people, the official said Sitharaman had allowed them to discount the extended stay to determine their residence status.The finance ministry said since it was not clear when the NRIs would be able to fly out, the Central Board of Direct Taxes had issued orders that this extended stay in India would not be counted to determine their residential status for the financial year 2020-21. The exact dates which shall be excluded shall be issued after international flights resume.The exception applies to individuals who came to India before 22 March and had been unable to leave the country on or before 31 March 2020. It will also benefit NRIs who had been quarantined in India after 1 March on account of Covid-19. This discounted calculation of dates shall be extended to NRIs whether they had left the country in an evacuation flight or were still in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stranded-indians-won-t-lose-nris-status-don-t-need-to-file-returns-in-india/story-rPHchWL1wfItiQpALAapMN.html
09-05-2020||India||NSA Ajit Doval packs in 3 blunt messages to Pak in daily PoK weather forecast||The Centre’s decision to ask television channels to include weather reports and forecasts for Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and the Northern Areas signals a significant shift in India’s strategy on Imran Khan’s Pakistan, people familiar with the development told Hindustan Times on Friday.The move was conceived by National Security Adviser Ajit Doval “some time back”, a top government official said.The formal proposal, crafted a little over three months back, went out from Deputy National Security Adviser (Strategic Affairs) Rajinder Khanna’s office on 3 February to the secretaries of foreign and home ministries apart from chiefs of India’s two lead intelligence agencies: Intelligence Bureau and the Research and Analysis Wing.Their formal approvals came last week.At one of the early discussions that were held to finetune the proposal, the official recalled how Doval had spoken of the multiple messages that this one move would send.The central point, the official said, is that “this is my area and I am asserting my sovereignty by taking all the steps”.This week, the government told public broadcaster Doordarshan to include weather forecasts of Mirpur and Muzaffarabad in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and Gilgit in the Northern Areas that are described by Pakistan as “Gilgit Baltistan”. Some private news channels have already told the government that they will also make changes to their weather bulletins.Doordarshan was also told to use weather maps that include the entire territory of Jammu and Kashmir that would serve as a daily, and public reiteration of India’s stand.A second senior government official said the move marked a shift in India’s approach that had been perceived to be hesitant to go all out to hammer the message to Pakistan, its allies and the world that Islamabad was in illegal occupation of over 86,000 square km of Jammu and Kashmir.This changes.For one, the assertion of sovereignty becomes particularly important because of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor that passes through the Northern Areas or, the expansive Gilgit-Baltistan region that is almost twice the size of Kerala.When China floated the Belt and Road Initiative a few years ago, it had expected India to be part of the project though it passes through the Northern Areas under Pakistani control. When India protested, Beijing told New Delhi to still join in because this would not affect the status of Kashmir as a dispute between the two countries.“The daily weather map reinforces India’s message on the entire territory of J&K, every day,” the official said.The daily weather forecast, and the map of India on the television screens, also underlines India’s strong views on the occupied territory but also the fact that Pakistan was making material changes to the region and exploiting the population of this region.In many ways, the official said, the map of India on the television screens also spotlights the plight of the people living in these areas whose rights are violated by Islamabad on a daily basis.There is another constituency that India hopes to message: the political establishment in the United Kingdom to ask them to not take sides.A large proportion of the Pakistani expatriate population in the United Kingdom is from Mirpur who have close links with Labour Party leaders such as Jeremy Corbyn who had gone to the extent of passing a resolution to seek international intervention after India scrapped Jammu and Kashmir’s special status.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nsa-ajit-doval-packs-in-3-blunt-messages-to-pak-in-daily-pok-weather-forecast/story-iYpODhNMD5FfFDU2GiuYNN.html

09-05-2020||Today's||Need pragmatic, positive and bold action to get back to work | Opinion||India is in the seventh week of the lockdown. During lockdown 2.0 and 3.0, many economic activities have been permitted with certain safeguards. In rural areas and in green zones, almost all economic activities are now allowed but these are not proving to be enough to lift the tempo of our nation’s production cycle. It is estimated that nearly 15-20 crore people are sitting at home without any avenue of productive economic activity. Certainly, this situation is not sustainable for long and some well-considered and bold decisions have to be taken to pull the country out of this state at the earliest.Today the decision makers are caught in the catch-22 situation. If the government reopens the economy and the virus spreads rapidly leading to a large number of deaths, they will be criticised for opening the economy too early. And if they do not open the economy, the economic situation will undoubtedly worsen and possibly lead to catastrophic results. No doubt, the number of coronavirus infected persons has increased to beyond the 50,000 mark and the number of fatalities are nearing 2,000. But the question is should we or should we not extend the lockdown further and with what restrictions?During the past three months, the world has learned a lot about this Sars-CoV-2 virus; its nature, pathology and measures to help serious patients recover. The Indian Council of Medical Research has already recommended prophylactic doses of Hydroxychloroquine and Azithral for doctors, nurses and paramedics taking care of coronavirus patients. In various countries, medicines such as Remdesivir, Lopinavir-Ritonavir, Plasma therapy and antibody injections have been tested to treat coronavirus patients and have been found to be quite useful in treating acute coronavirus patients. Several coronavirus vaccines are at an advanced level of trials. Several Indian pharma companies are hopeful that sooner than later, India will be producing vaccines for its population. All these developments give rise to the hope that in the fight against this virus, the victory is in sight.Experts across the world are of the opinion that infections of coronavirus, for unknown reasons, have been very mild in India. Our hospitals have not been overwhelmed by coronavirus patients anywhere, As per the information available in public domain, there are still very few coronavirus patients requiring ventilator services. The Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan hospital in Delhi has arranged 80-odd ICU beds with a ventilator facility. But there are never more than single digit patients requiring ventilator support. The same is true for almost all the major coronavirus hospitals across the country. So it can be inferred that the impact of Covid-19 in India is mild and the number of patients who require ventilator services has been negligible in our context. Now compare it with tuberculosis, or TB, which causes more than a thousand deaths every day in our country. We have more than 25 lakh confirmed cases of TB even today. Fortunately several potential medicines for treating corona are beginning to appear on the shelf, and as per available indications, vaccines for this virus will be out in the market sooner than anybody had expected.No doubt the lockdowns have served the purpose, but now the country has to focus on the economy. Daily wage earners are on the verge of starvation, the number of unemployed has reached an all-time high and supply chains are completely disrupted. To reverse the situation, all economic activities need to be opened up except cinema halls, sports, educational institutions that can open after some time. Restrictive opening is not helping the cause. People have fully understood what they need to do to prevent getting infected, now they should be tasked to follow the necessary precautions at their workplace. Testing and treatment facilities for all those showing symptoms have to be ensured in all government and private hospitals.The central government has lost nearly Rs 3 lakh crore by way of revenue and states nearly Rs 2 lakh crore that will need to be recouped by borrowing from RBI directly, so that the government system comes back to its optimum health. Businesses, small and big, will need to be provided loans for their working capital requirements without any delay. The labour force is desperate and eager to go back to work. They have survived the worst.Time and again, countries, societies, businesses, people have gone through these kinds of situations and with prudent handling, they come out strong. The time has come to prove again that nothing is beyond collective human endeavour. Finally we have had enough of this all pervading coronavirus fear, now we need pragmatic, positive and bold action.(VS Pandey is a former IAS officer.
