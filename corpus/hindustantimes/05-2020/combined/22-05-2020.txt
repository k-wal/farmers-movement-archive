22-05-2020||News||Reimagining abundance in post-Covid-19 India||As people return to life and work post the lockdown, some predictions point to a mad rush to do even more than before. Travel more, buy more, meet more people, eat out more — do more of more. The government too is expected to do more to restore economic growth and livelihoods. Much more is anticipated from the State. Some see it as an opportunity to overtake China.To achieve this, many states might roll back labour laws that took decades of human rights movements to build, and push aside hard-won environmental protection. If we succumb, will we return to the old normal, or an even older 19th century normal? Will the “more” being planned heal the economy or plunge us faster into the next disaster? Is there another imagination to achieve the common goals of opportunity and prosperity for all?This crisis has demonstrated that prosperous, healthy and well-governed communities can tackle public health emergencies well. But how do we define prosperity and move towards such a society? For centuries, prosperity has been easy to define in material terms. At a personal level, by how much one earns; how much one has. At a societal level, through Gross Domestic Product (GDP), a computation of all assets and interactions within an economy. GDP cannot discount products and services that are bad for society, such as the output of polluting industries, or of sweatshops. Several attempts to retool GDP have made little headway.However, during the pandemic, most people, including the elite, experienced different forms of frugality, simplicity, and dignity associated with personal labour. After decades, urbanites also encountered purity — of air and water, and diversity — of flora and fauna. Simple things acquired fresh value for many. The time may be ripe to retool GDP. We now hold a brighter vision of how things can be, and can converse creatively with our future from an altered present.One pathway is to shift from a mindset of scarcity to a mindset of abundance. For there is abundance everywhere, if only we look for it. If this profusion of resources goes from being just abundant to being effective, perhaps we could lean away from economic choices that appear inevitable, but that destroy natural capital and human well-being.Let’s list some things that are abundant in India.At a societal level, India has the world’s largest working population. At 13 million, it also has the most number of teachers. It has health care professionals, from super-speciality doctors to accredited social health activists (Asha). At a physical level, India is blessed with a rich biodiversity of flora and fauna. We have a predictable monsoon, and a vast network of rivers and water bodies. We have one of the longest coastlines. We have enormous access to solar energy. We also have among the world’s most sophisticated digital infrastructure, and an increasing penetration of Internet services and smartphones.At a spiritual level, we have a plethora of practices and leadership across religions. And we enjoy the affluence of volunteer energy, as evidenced recently. This is not just an inventory of our assets, but the robust foundation for what we want to achieve. During the pandemic, food bloggers came up with a simple and potent idea. They asked what was left in people’s refrigerators, and helped them cook up wonderful new recipes with existing ingredients. They re-purposed what existed, and allowed people to experience plenty from paucity.This is a perfect analogy for what the nation could put into practice, and, is already experimenting with.Using digital infrastructure, like Diksha, millions of teachers are creating and sharing better content and classroom practices, both physical and virtual. Parental creativity and peer groups, both plentiful resources, are also being engaged to help children learn better.Using the Extension of Community Healthcare Outcomes (Echo) model, health care workers are receiving virtual, guided mentoring. This moves knowledge instead of people, to build faster, more sustainable capacity across the chain.Overnight, you can overturn an apparent scarcity — the lack of good teachers or skilled health workers — into an abundance of distributed, empowered talent. Opportunities are everywhere — in energy, in mobility, in agriculture, and in livelihood generation. If we can use this flipped thinking, it can create more headroom for those who genuinely need resources — more carbon for the energy-deficient; more land for the landless; more mobility for transport deficit areas, and more potential for sustainable and meaningful livelihoods everywhere. For example, India’s ubiquitous building infrastructure can be re-purposed to harness solar energy, or for vertical and terrace farming. Work from home will relieve the pressure on urban infrastructure and land, which can be released for mass housing or public transport, and critical lung space. Last but not least, let’s unlock our spiritual treasure trove. Most disciplines invite us to more mindfulness, and more contentment. Not by consuming more externally, but by harvesting more from within, and by sharing more without. Neurosciences and behavioural sciences increasingly corroborate this ancient wisdom — joy can come from giving, and unlimited happiness from bonhomie.Flipping to an abundance mindset is a creative-yet-practical task for samaj (society) first, but also for the bazaar (market) and sarkaar (State). We know now that we need to emerge from this crisis together. Let’s boldly use the stimulus to redefine prosperity and redirect resources to make abundance effective.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/reimagining-abundance-in-post-covid-19-india/story-18YfUYERpERAYtyeJQPoPO.html
22-05-2020||News||Lipu Lekh: The past, present and future of the Nepal-India stand-off| Analysis||Two of the world’s closest neighbours, India and Nepal, are locked in a cartographic, diplomatic, and to an extent, a political stand-off. The dispute is over the ownership of nearly 330 sq km of land called Kalapani near Nepal’s western tri-junction with India and China. The dispute was triggered in November 2019 when India issued a new map to indicate the changed status of Jammu and Kashmir into a Union Territory. Nepal raised objections because the Kalapani area was shown as being in India. Indian maps have always shown it that way; therefore, there was no change in the map. This was followed by Nepal’s objections to the inauguration of a road from Darchula to Lipu Lekh Pass, aimed at strengthening India’s defence supply lines as well as facilitating smooth passage for pilgrims to Kailash Mansarovar in Tibet. Nepal said this road is an encroachment on its sovereignty. There have been street protests, parliament has agitated, and now the Nepal government has issued its map showing Kalapani as its territory. New Delhi has reiterated that the area belongs to India, and would be willing to resolve the dispute through diplomatic negotiations after the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) crisis is over.Nepal’s claims are rooted in the Sugauli Treaty signed with the British in March 1816. In this, Nepal renounced “all claims to or connextions (as in original text) with the countries lying to the west of river Kali…” (Art.V). The land east of the Kali thus remained with Nepal. This claim is reinforced by some old revenue records and gazette notifications.India accepts this position, but its claim arises from the ambiguity in the treaty on the identification of the Kali river and its origin. According to India, the river originates from Lipu Lekh and then merges into other streams and tributaries to become the Mahakali. Nepal’s contention is that Kali originates from Limpiyadhura and the stream originating from Lipu Lekh is called Lipu Khola. Hence the dispute. The area between these two streams is Kalapani. The treaty underwent some revisions to accommodate Nepal in the Terai (southern part) and was finally endorsed by the British government on November 15, 1860.The maps issued by the British between 1816 and 1860 generally favour the Nepali position. But, the maps issued afterwards endorse India’s position. It is possible that the British administration changed this position through proper surveys or subsequently decided to manipulate this position, to serve its larger strategic and commercial interests in using the Lipu Lekh pass for access to Tibet. Independent India was handed over access to Kalapani and Lipu Lekh by the British. Blaming India for any encroachment is baseless. It must be borne in mind that much before the British came, or the Gurkha kings annexed Kumaon and Garhwal regions — then surrendered under the Sugauli Treaty — Indians were using this route for the pilgrimage to Kailash Mansarovar. The route has deep spiritual and civilisational significance for India. China accepted Lipu Lekh as one of the cultural and commercial transit points with India under its 1954 Peaceful Co-Existence Agreement. This was reiterated in 2015 in a joint statement during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to China.Nepal has endorsed India’s position for nearly 150 years. It used Indian maps showing Kalapani, Limpiyadhura and Lipu Lekh in India. Objections to this were raised in the 1980s, but were ignored by the royal regimes. Since 2000, the two surveyed the length of their boundary to resolve outstanding issues, except in two areas, including Kalapani. It is mutually agreed that these issues will be resolved through diplomatic negotiations. Why then has the Nepal government turned up the heat on the Kalapani issue? Prime Minister KP Oli faces serious internal opposition at the moment, including from within his ruling Nepal Communist Party. This is largely on account of his governance failures and lack of action on combating the pandemic. He has consolidated his nationalist image since 2015 by fighting India’s ill-advised diplomatic intervention on the constitution issue and the counterproductive economic coercion (partial economic blockade) that followed. He perhaps hopes that this face-off with India on Kalapani will give him a new lease of political life. The strategic community in India apprehends that Nepal is also being prompted by China to get India out of Kalapani. Indian Army chief General MM Navrane’s indirect reference in an Institute of Defence Studies and Analyses lecture may be recalled here. This apparently conflicts with China’s endorsement of the Indian position in 1954 and 2015. However, China is seldom straight in diplomacy. It is unhappy with India’s growing strategic proximity to the United States. It has also objected to India’s defence infrastructure upgradation projects all along the border. The Darchula-Lipu Lekh road is one such project. Needling India and alienating Kathmandu from New Delhi serves China’s broader purpose. This explains why is it is playing an active role in preserving the unity of the Nepal Communist Party and protecting the Oli regime.Prolonging this stand-off is not in the interest of either Nepal or India. It will be exploited by the third parties to their advantage. India and Nepal, keeping in mind their mutual stakes and concerns, should through resilient and mutually accommodative diplomacy, resolve this.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/lipu-lekh-the-past-present-and-future-of-the-nepal-india-stand-off-analysis/story-wy3OvSD0G0nkxtGQTOIp2I.html
22-05-2020||News||Framing an agenda for the Opposition||Already battling the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), West Bengal has been battered by Cyclone Amphan. While preparatory arrangements and evacuations of five lakh people by the state government ensured that the loss of life was minimised, the devastation suffered by families and the damage to public and private properties as well as the ecology of Bengal has been incalculable. The cyclone is a national calamity. In this hour of pain and tragedy, Bengal seeks everyone’s cooperation. All stakeholders, state and central, have to come together to provide relief and solace to those who are suffering. It is against this backdrop that Opposition parties meet on Friday, for the first time since Covid-19 hit India. There is much to discuss. Many states are run by parties that are in Opposition at the Centre. They will share experiences. They will also compare notes on the Centre’s response and on the gap between its words and deeds. The political impact of the Covid-19 response and the spirit of federalism will inevitably come up.ALSO WATCH | TMC MP counters low testing charge; accuses BJP of politicising Covid fightIt is important to note that all Opposition parties were not always on the same page. In early March, the Trinamool Congress, and a few others, were aggressive in urging adjournment of Parliament and taking coordinated steps. The National Democratic Alliance government would not listen. Some Opposition parties decided to trust its judgment. Meanwhile, in West Bengal, chief minister Mamata Banerjee began preparing, regardless of New Delhi’s views.When the 21-day national lockdown was announced, at just four hours’ notice and without consultation, the Opposition parties and their state governments continued to be supportive. They abided by Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi’s request to eschew politics in this hour. It is another matter that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) sought to politicise the response to Covid-19 in the states, with the bulk of the party-sanctioned online drivel being reserved for Bengal.The BJP and the Centre have showboated their efforts. They have grabbed publicity, but left the states to handle the crisis. I will illustrate with two sets of examples: Testing and cost of treatment; and the so-called economic stimulus announced last week.On April 22, the West Bengal government was the first to announce free treatment for Covid-19 patients in private hospitals requisitioned by the state. The government undertook the cost. On April 30, the Maharashtra government imposed a price cap on Covid-19 treatment by private hospitals. It took a leaf out of West Bengal’s book and extended free treatment to all residents of the state under the state health insurance scheme.This is how states learnt from each other. What did the Centre do? It confused everybody on the testing protocol and was at sixes and sevens when it came to providing overarching guidance to states, both before and after March 24. Testing labs could be cleared for Covid-19 only by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). The Union health ministry and ICMR took their time. In states where 20 laboratories were required, and available, only two were cleared. Once the clearances came, the states got to work. Laboratories have been working in double and triple shifts to ramp up testing. Bengal is testing close to 9,000 samples a day, among the highest in India. If we could not test so many earlier, it was because the clearances and kits from the Centre did not arrive. That is not an excuse; it is a fact. Governments from Bengal to Chhattisgarh and Kerala to Punjab have complained of such over-centralisation. While many states have gradually increased their testing numbers over two months, I must point to the curious case of Gujarat. It showed a jump from 3,000 to 10,000 tests in a single day. Is there something more than meets the eye? The Centre has been talking about Ayushman Bharat and its role in the Covid-19 fightback. How credible are such claims? Let me give you some numbers. Of the 2.5 million tests done, only 3,000 — 0.12% — have been covered by Ayushman Bharat. Of the 100,000 people who have tested positive, only 2,000 — about 2% — have been treated under Ayushman Bharat. Make your own assessment.Now I come to the stimulus package. We are in a crisis and standard macroeconomic principles say the government must immediately stimulate demand. Of the 500 million-strong Indian workforce, 93% work in the unorganised sector. Many have lost livelihoods, without savings or any safety net. A massive direct cash infusion — one can debate the exact quantum — is unavoidable. But the Centre has carefully avoided this.The Centre has placed the burden on the state governments, telling them it has raised the borrowing limit under the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act from 3% of the Gross State Domestic Product to 5%. The states would have welcomed this, if not for the fine print. The increase is only from 3% to 3.5%, after which it becomes conditional on impossible benchmarks that include one nation-one ration card; power sector reform (a pipedream in the midst of an economic crisis); or augmenting urban local body revenues (at a time when city economies are reeling). Then, there is the abandonment of guest (migrant) workers. Clearly, there’s much on the Covid-19 response to discuss at today’s Opposition meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/framing-an-agenda-for-the-opposition/story-CzbmZ4YSpFECWMZAafPcUM.html
22-05-2020||News||On economics, the Sangh and the PM are united||On April 26, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) Sarsanghchalak (head) Mohan Bhagwat addressed swayamsevaks for the second time in a month. While not unusual, this time it was different. He called India’s 1.3 billion people his own. Critics may think this was just a convenient turn of phrase. But his sentiments are a true reflection of the Sangh’s thinking.People who heard the three-day lecture series at Vigyan Bhavan two years ago will know that this is no new development. Bhagwat expressed similar thoughts in his annual Vijayadashami address as well. The Sangh considers every Indian to be a Hindu. Since this is the foundation of its thinking, then the mistakes of a few shouldn’t be seen as a reflection on society as a whole. And those who have made mistakes should accept them, and move on. ALSO WATCH | PM Modi’s stimulus for self-reliant India. Enough to reboot Indian economy?Bhagwat spoke of swadeshi (indigenous) and self-reliance. Sangh-inspired organisations such as the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh and the Swadeshi Jagran Manch have also been making efforts to realise these objectives. Recently, in his Panchayati Raj Day address, Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi also spoke about being self-sufficient right from the village level. On May 12, the PM spoke about Aatmnirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India). RSS ideologue, Dattopant Thengadi, who was instrumental in creating these organisations, was one of the most vociferous proponents of swadeshi and Aatmnirbhar Bharat. Thengadi, in his book Third Way, laid out a road map for a self-dependent India. Most critics of swadeshi are confused about the concept. For them, swadeshi implies turning the wheel back to the 19th century. Thengadi said, “we require computer chips and not potato chips”. Swadeshi is the practical manifestation of patriotism. Patriotism should not be seen as isolationism. Patriots are not against internationalism. He added, “Their pleas for national self-reliance are not incompatible with international cooperation, provided that latter is on equal footing — with due regard to the national respect of every country.”In his lectures, he quoted the effect of Mahatma Gandhi’s influence on Motilal Nehru’s lifestyle that was initially considered lavish by that era’s standards. But Motilal Nehru switched to khadi at the Mahatma’s request. In his address to the nation, the PM also emphasised the use of local brands. The origin of the coronavirus disease in China and the subsequent news about the supply of substandard Chinese goods to different countries have given India a big push to become self-reliant. On the other hand, India has given appropriate aid and assistance to many countries following the spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam (the world is one family). Indian scientists and industrialists have also contributed towards making India self-reliant. The Sangh chief also urged the government to fulfil its obligations in this regard. He said that the administration will have to become more responsible and people-oriented. Recently, the Bharatiya Shikshan Mandal, an organisation inspired by the Sangh, also announced a competition for an indigenous video conferencing app. Both the Sangh and the PM are unanimous about the economic direction of the country. According to the PM, in a post-Covid-19 world, the country should head towards self-reliance, organic farming and a swadeshi-based economy. These are issues that the Sangh chief mentioned in his Vijayadashami speech. He also mentioned that foreign investment should also come to India only on India’s terms. The government has rightly made recent changes in its foreign investment policy in this context. The lockdown has resulted in huge improvements in the quality of the environment. The clear air and clean flowing rivers are proof. The need for a lifestyle based on the conservation and the protection of nature is imperative for India. The sarsanghchalak has also emphasised the need for society to move forward without exploiting nature.At this crucial time, the swayamsevaks are engaged in several services to help all Indians, irrespective of differences, who are vulnerable at this time. Today, more than 340,000 swayamsevaks are offering services at about 67,000 locations across India.Apart from delivering ration kits to more than five million families, they have delivered over 300 million cooked food packets to people and have made over 22,466 blood donations. The government and administration can maintain the lockdown in the country only for a certain amount of time. Society can emulate the practices of the Sangh to maintain disciple post the lockdown. Even after the lockdown is lifted, people have to learn to stay away from crowded places. Similarly, the State and the administration too will have to change according to the needs of society. Overall, we must move towards a new nature-based self-reliant society and governance.Rajiv Tuli is a member of the RSS’s Delhi state executiveThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/on-economics-the-sangh-and-the-pm-are-united/story-ieqegDNyVQ40939pCN3cdM.html

Under quarantine for the moment, all of them took a loan between Rs 25 lakh and Rs 40 lakh on high-interest rate from private financiers and selling land. Ranjogh Singh, 21, (name changed) of Bhogpur in Jalandhar district, said, “Travel agents duped us and got us to take an illegal route. I reached Mexico only in September last year, where the agents dumped me. I hired a new agent to help me cross the Mexico border to reach the US, where we were caught and kept in a detention centre.”The only child in the family, Ranjogh says his mother paid ₹9 lakh to another agent, Jasso, of Jalandhar, who promised to get him released from the detention centre, but were duped again. “My US dream has ended in a nightmare. The agent, Jassi, will have to return my money and I will open a shop here.” Jatinder Singh, 26, of Dhirpur village left his house on July 11, travelling through the four countries of Dubai, Russia, finally entering America through Mexico on September 20. He too, however, was caught and remained in a detention centre. “I paid Rs 25 lakh to the agent. I request everyone who is planning to go the US to only take the proper route. We lost everything in trying the illegal route.”Rakesh Kumar, 21, of Hoshiarpur took a flight to Mexico from India on June 8, landing there on June 10. He entered the US on September 1 and then detention centres followed. His father Ashok Kumar claims that he got trapped in the sweet talk of a travel agent Ajay Srivastava and agreed to send his son to the US and paid ₹40 lakh (by taking ₹20 lakh on loan and ₹ 20 lakh by selling plot). Rakesh says, “My father is still paying Rs 30,000 a month as interest on loan he took.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/illegal-entrants-to-us-return-to-doaba-with-shattered-dreams-stare-at-heavy-loans/story-wMgSOsDuBBlE6RnMzdzAjL.html
22-05-2020||Chandigarh||Wheat stubble burning cases at 11,844, highest in two years||Even as the state government expected a dip in the number of wheat stubble burning cases this season due to the covid-19 pandemic, the number of such instances in the state has touched 11,844, the highest since 2018. In 2019, the number was 10,114 and 10,993 in 2018. The period in all these years was from April 15 to May 22. Friday itself saw 431 cases, with the 2018 figure on this date being 98, and 330 in 2019. In the state, wheat stubble is used to make dry fooder for cattle, and farmers burn only the leftover roots. These roots can be easily mixed in the soil, but some farmers find it easier to burn it to clear it.“It is shocking for us why farmers are not listening to the appeals issued by the government agencies, farm bodies and doctors. This time, burning stubble is very dangerous especially when the smoke emitted from farm fires attacks the lungs; the novel coronavirus also damages lungs,” said Harinder Singh Lakhowal, president, a faction of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU).He added they had been educating farmers on in-situ management of wheat stubble, something that they had been doing successfully for years. “Farmers in Bathinda, Sangrur and Barnala are more prone to breaking the law due to their leftist bent of mind and tendency to be anti-government,” Lakhowal claimed. State agriculture secretary Kahan Singh Pannu said, “We are taking punitive action against errant farmers, but I think we have to adopt strict measures to stop the nuisance. Farmers seem to be adamant and have, so far, not cared to follow orders.” Till May 30, the government has imposed a fine of Rs 33 lakh on farmers as environment compensation in 1,191 cases of stubble fires. Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) member secretary Krunesh Garg said environment compensation would also be levied in 1,368 other cases. “Special teams have visited 5,241 sites where stubble burning was reported,” he added. According to PPCB data compiled till Thursday, Moga has reported the most cases at 1,070; Bathinda (1,051); Ferozepur (997); Amritsar 1,009; Muktsar (925); Gurdaspur (800); Tarn Taran 770 and Ludhiana 648.‘KHARIF SEASON TO BE WORSE’Brijendra Pateria, regional head of the State Remote Sensing Centre which detects these fires, says, “Farmers are not listening to appeals and are simply burning wheat stubble. If this trend continues, kharif season will be far worse as farm fires are concerned. The government will need to take strict steps to check this.” He added that due to the pandemic, priorities of district administration and other departments tended to be different, but everybody must be on the same page to tackle the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/wheat-stubble-burning-cases-at-11-844-highest-in-two-years/story-Io0gwpJLzbISZXqgKK345N.html

Singh, who is lodged in Tihar jail, New Delhi, will be released on Saturday. Justice Vikas Kunvar Srivastav passed the order in his chamber. “I find force in submissions made by learned counsel for the bail-applicant. Therefore, the bail application is allowed,” the court said in the order.Singh, along with his wife who was killed in a road accident on July 28 last, has been instrumental in his niece’s fight for justice. The car in which the survivor, her lawyer and aunts were travelling on the day of the accident, was also provided to the lawyer by Singh. “All cases lodged against Mahesh Singh were fake. He has been falsely implicated and repeatedly so ever since his family fell out with the MLA and his family,” said the petitioner’s counsel Prashant Singh ‘Atal’. Kuldeep Singh Sengar, who was then BJP MLA from Unnao’s Bangarmau constituency and was later expelled from the party, and his aides had raped the girl on July 4, 2017.Sengar, his brother and three aides were convicted for culpable homicide not amounting to murder (Section 304), criminal conspiracy (120B), wrongful restraint (341), voluntarily causing hurt (323) of the Indian Penal Code and under relevant sections of the Arms Act. Sengar was later sentenced to life in December last year.Policemen Ashok Singh Bhadauria and KP Singh were also convicted for registering a false complaint (Sections 211 and 218) against the survivor’s father as well as for assaulting him in judicial custody.Sengar’s aides thrashed the survivor’s father and his co-worker on April 3, 2018, in Unnao, where he had gone to attend a hearing in the rape case. The survivor’s father died in the jail hospital five days later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/hc-grants-bail-to-unnao-rape-survivor-s-uncle/story-FVskclUdkqCG7t6yHU6LgJ.html

Unclean toilets, stained lobby, garbage heaps lying in the corners are some of the most common complaints by those lodged in these quarantine centres set up by the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC). Some have also found houseflies in the dal served to them in the food packets at Bhayandar pada.The number of Covid-19 cases has increased to 1,500 in the city. Due to an insufficient number of beds in hospitals and hotels, asymptomatic positive and suspected patients are kept in the quarantine centres.An 18-year-old positive patient from Sawarkarnagar who was admitted in New Horizon School quarantine centre on Monday, said, “There are more than 100 people admitted in this centre who use a single washroom. The washroom is foul-smelling and has not been cleaned in a long time. No one has even cleaned our room in the past five days.”The centre has around 1,000 beds. The lobby has heaps of scrap lying around. A 40-year-old patient said, “I am here for almost a week; however, no doctor has visited to check our condition. We are not provided with masks too. The toilets are in unhygienic condition, while the building is not even clean.”A family admitted to a quarantine centre in Bhayandar Pada has also had a terrible experience. A 38-year-old patient said, “The quality of food served to us is bad; however, we never complained. Today there were dead flies in dal, so we returned the meal. Even if a patient is fit, he will fall sick in this condition.”The civic body, however, has refuted most of the claims. Sandeep Malvi, deputy municipal commissioner of TMC, said, “We have made all the necessary arrangements at all our quarantine centres and there is no dearth of any facility. The Bhayandar Pada centre has a separate kitchen attached where food is prepared for all those staying at this centre. We have not received any complaints. Moreover, food is packed properly and then distributed to the residents. Apart from regular meals, we also provide them with eggs and milk for nutrition. However, if there is any such complaint, we will look into it. We will ensure that the building is cleaned.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patients-at-thane-quarantine-facilities-complain-of-dirty-toilets-and-garbage-heaps-in-corners/story-oKbOfvRVXS4NlA0aa7IcGO.html

22-05-2020||Chandigarh||Covid effect: Caddies return to Chandigarh golf course as ball spotters||When the Chandigarh Golf Club reopened its course for the golfers on Wednesday after a long gap of 60 days due to the Covid-19 lockdown, an important part of the sport was missing on the sprawling greens — the caddy. Generally the lowest paid personnel in the sport of the elite, a caddy plays an important role in a golfer’s career. But the coronavirus situation has now put the caddy in a role different from accompanying the golfers and carrying their bags and clubs. With social distancing coming into play, the caddies will now be spotting the balls. For the last three days, the club has been screening its registered caddies who are living outside the containment zone of Bapu Dham Colony, and they will be on the course from Saturday. They will be stationed at a particular place on the fairways.“As far as professional golfers are concerned, caddy is an important asset and contributes in the performance on the greens. Caddy is the only one with whom a golfer can talk, discuss and take suggestions during the course of the game,” says Asian Tour winner Ajeetesh Sandhu. “For the last seven years, whenever I play in Chandigarh, Ankur Kumar has been my caddy. I met the 27-year-old yesterday, and he told me that he will be coming to the course from Saturday. I am happy that an important part of the sport is returning to the golf course,” adds Sandhu.The club management has identified 170 caddies living in Kishangarh and Kansal (outside the containment zone), out of which 144, in two batches, will be working as a ball spotters on a daily basis. The club is paying ₹200 per day to the remaining caddies as well.“This initiative will surely make golf more enjoyable as less time will be spent in searching for golf balls and filling up divots. With the spotter caddies being in place, the pace of play will improve and we may reduce the time slot between tee offs from 15 minutes to 10 minutes from the next week,” says club president Sandeep Singh Sandhu. “The caddies will go through the same screening protocol on a daily basis as the golfers do,” says Col APS Johal, general manager of then club.HOW CADDIES HELP A GOLFERA caddy’s job is not only to carry the golfer’s kit, but also advise them on many facets of the course during the event. “Knowing the etiquettes of the game, a caddy has to be at his best on the golf course. A good caddy understands the psychology of the golfer. If, during a match, a golfer hits a rough patch, the caddy needs to pull him out of it immediately,” says caddy Ankur. “During the tournament, I generally give feedback to the golfer on the correct putting line and the grains of the greens, besides keeping tabs on the movement of the wind,” says senior caddy Nobat Ram, 45, who is one of the most sought-after caddies at the club. He has the distinction of being a caddy to top professionals like Jeev Milkha Singh, Amandeep Johal and Gurbaz Mann, and has travelled with them to eight international tournaments to Asian countries. His latest overseas outing was to Malaysia with Jeev in the first week of March before the lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/covid-effect-caddies-return-to-chandigarh-golf-course-as-ball-spotters/story-BfIRrUI8WoqxLvZJEokpCI.html

On Thursday, the city had recorded a maximum temperature of 42.5 degrees Celsius.The Palam observatory in Delhi, which according to the MeT department officials gives an accurate reading of Gurugram’s weather, also recorded a season-high temperature of 45.4 degrees Celsius on Friday.Near heat wave conditions are likely to prevail in the city over the next three days with the mercury expected to rise by a few more degree Celsius, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Friday.“Heat wave is likely to continue over a few places in Delhi-NCR from May 23 till 25. Clear skies and dry north-westerly winds blowing over Northwest India and Delhi-NCR have made conditions favourable for heatwaves,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of the IMD’s regional forecasting centre in Delhi.“Two conditions have to be met for the declaration of a heat wave. First, the maximum temperature has to touch 45 degree Celsius. Second, the temperature must be 4.5 degrees above the normal temperature,” said Srivastava.Past data from Gurugram is insufficient due to which weather inference is drawn mainly by relying on Palam observatory data for estimating the departure from normal. “Gurugram has an automatic weather station and there is no past record of data. Palam is already facing heat wave conditions on the basis of which we can say that Gurugram is also facing near heat-wave conditions,” Srivastava.On Friday, the minimum temperature was recorded at 23.7 degrees Celsius. While the minimum temperature is predicted to rise by a degree and touch 25 on Saturday, the maximum temperature is likely to remain in the range of 44-45 degree Celsius for the next few days, as per an IMD forecast.The air quality in the city remained in the ‘moderate’ category on Friday, according to the Central Pollution Control Board’s air quality index (AQI) bulletin. The city recorded an AQI reading of 139, a marginal deterioration from the previous day’s 123. The average daily concentration of particulate matter (PM) 2.5, the city’s most prominent pollutant, on Friday was 81.9 µg/m³, as per the HSPCB’s official air quality monitor at Vikas Sadan.As per the IMD’s weekly forecast, a clear sky is likely to prevail this week for the most part with temperatures staying within the range of 44-45 degrees Celsius.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/city-experiences-hottest-day-of-the-season-near-heatwave-conditions-likely-to-prevail/story-KjHbkxB6oc9hQW9EsQ5hTK.html

22-05-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram to use TrueNat tests before discharging Covid-19 patients||The district health department is likely to start using TrueNat tests from Monday at the old civil hospital for conducting confirmatory tests on Covid-19 patients before discharging them from hospitals.TrueNat— a diagnostic machine used for testing drug-resistant tuberculosis— has recently been validated by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) for confirmatory detection of the Sars-Cov-2 virus (which causes the coronavirus disease) to boost testing capacities.On April 10, ICMR had approved the use of TrueNat for screening purposes only. The guidelines were revised on May 21 with ICMR recommending it as a screening as well as a confirmatory test for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).“TrueNat is as effective as Reverse Transcription – Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test— a laboratory method used for detecting coronavirus,” said Dr Vijay Kumar, district tuberculosis officer.“The TrueNat is a diagnostic tool, which involves two-step step process —E gene screening assay for the suspected Covid-19 samples followed by a confirmatory assay of RdRp gene. As per the ICMR guidelines, if the E gene screening is negative, the sample will be considered as true negative. But if the sample is positive, the RdRp assay will be done, which will serve as a confirmatory test. If the sample tests positive, it will be considered as true positive and an RT-PCR test will not be required furhter,” said Dr Kumar.Dr Kumar said the turnaround time for a single test is around 40 minutes. “Two samples can be processed at a time. Initially, we would test 35 samples a day,” he said. As many as eight lab technicians will be trained on Saturday by a team appointed by the central government to conduct TrueNat tests, he added.Dr Jaswant Singh Punia, district chief medical officer (CMO), said, “The TueNat test will be primarily used as a confirmatory test before discharging a patient. It will save time and reduce the burden on the state lab. Also, high-risk contacts need to be tested immediately and we will use TrueNat tests then. For fresh suspected cases, we will continue to send samples for RT-PCR tests to Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (PGIMS) in Rohtak” According to Dr Kumar, the TrueNat machine— provided by the state government— will be installed at the district tuberculosis centre in the old Civil Hospital near Bus Stand Road where tuberculosis tests are being already conducted. “In case there is any technical issue, the machine will be installed at the Primary Health Centre in Wazirabad,” he said adding that ICMR allows TrueNat Covid-19 testing in district hospitals and at the primary health centre level.The TrueNat machine is portable and runs on battery and consists of an inbuilt device that extracts RNA extraction, officials added. Like RT-PCR tests, throat and nasal swabs will be collected for TrueNat testing.Since February the RT-PCR has been used to test more than 11,000 samples in Gurugram. Initially, the samples were sent to All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Delhi, but were later sent to PGIMS, Rohtak and Bhagat Phool Singh Government Medical College, Sonepat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-to-use-truenat-tests-before-discharging-covid-19-patients/story-qfZBohJrsme179yRIzqyRM.html
22-05-2020||Lucknow||‘Ram temple site in Ayodhya a Buddhist Sthal’||Claiming that the ancient artefacts found during the land levelling work at Ram Janmabhoomi in Ayodhya on Thursday proved that it was a Buddha Sthal (Buddhist pilgrimage site), Congress leader Udit Raj demanded analysis of the recovered items by Archaeological Survey of India (ASI).In a tweet on Friday, the former MP stated that the ‘Dhamma Chakra’ and ‘Stupas’ recovered from the site bore testimony to his claim. “I am not commenting on the Supreme court verdict as the Apex Court had said it was a matter of faith. But all I am demanding is to get the area studied properly by a team of ASI so that historical facts were not distorted as evidence prove that the place is a centre of Buddhism. The ‘Dhamma Chakra’ and ‘Stupas’ found at the site of proposed temple is a clear evidence of what I am saying,” he said.“It is a historical fact that Faxian, the Chinese Buddhist monk who had travelled to India, had written about the presence of 100 Ashoka Stupas in Ayodhya. All I want is to save historical facts and not let it get distorted,” he added.The ground levelling work at the proposed site of Ram temple construction started from May 11.Caption Ancient artefacts recovered from proposed site of ram temple in Ayodhya recently.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/ram-temple-site-in-ayodhya-a-buddhist-sthal/story-aDrCNpNa4sRnkI72niQ2hP.html
22-05-2020||Gurugram||HSIIDC increases FAR for plots for housing migrant workers||In a significant move that will help boost affordable housing for migrant workers in industrial estates and townships of the district, the Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation (HSIIDC) has approved a 10% increase in the Floor Area Ratio (FAR) for industrial housing on plots of one acre or more in the industrial estates developed by it. This new rule will also cover the new policy for the allotment of housing units and dormitories for industrial workers on a leasehold basis, the agency said. The decision was taken in a board meeting of HSIIDC under the chairmanship of Rajesh Khullar, principal secretary to the chief minister of Haryana, on Thursday.The decision to increase FAR assumes importance in the backdrop of large scale migration of industrial workers from Gurugram and other areas of Haryana, who worked in the industrial estates of Manesar, Udyog Vihar, Rewari and other areas across the state until the nationwide lockdown brought industrial activity to a standstill. High rent and localisation of these residential facilities in concretised villages have been the reasons why the migrants workers have made a beeline to return to their native states in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, admit local industrialists.Presently, the FAR allowed by HSIIDC at its plots is 1.25, which can be extended to 1.50 if the plot owner pays the charges for increase in the FAR. The new directive by the industrial agency allows for a 10% increase in the FAR, which means the industrialists will be able to build more housing on their plots for accommodating the workers. The draft policy shall be uploaded shortly on the official website of HSIIDC for inviting comments from allottees and stakeholders, the authority said.The FAR is the ratio of a building’s total floor area to the size of the plot upon which it is built. It decides the amount of construction that can be carried out on a plot. Any increase in this limit allows for increased construction.Anurag Agarwal, managing director, HSIIDC, in a statement issued on Thursday evening said that this proposal has been considered in the view of post-Covid scenario, wherein in-situ housing of workers / labourers will be prioritised. This policy is beneficial, considering the increased requirement of ready-to-move-in premises as well as liquidity and time constraints of the industrialists to invest in labour housing.“This will act as an incentive to retain workers and provide them with the facilities at a minimum cost. The HSIIDC has ready-to-move-in dwelling units and dormitories for industrial workers at IMT, Manesar as well as in Industrial Estate, Kundli”, he added.At present, the majority of labourers working in the industrial areas of Gurugram and Manesar stays in Kasan, Khoh, Aliar, Baas Haria, Dundahera, Mollahera, Nathupur, Chakkarpur, Sirhaul and similar villages that have turned into large urban clusters, thereby increasing the rates of rental accommodation.The industrialists based in Gurugram and Manesar, meanwhile, welcomed the move but said that additional FAR should be given free of cost to the industry as it is reeling under intense financial pressure. “We welcome this move as it will boost housing for workers as presently they are living in villages located inside the industrial estates or adjacent to the industrial areas. The living conditions and basic hygiene in these areas are appalling and the rent is very high. We will work with the government to make this proposal successful,” said Manmohan Gaind, vice president, Manesar Industries Welfare Association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/hsiidc-increases-far-for-plots-for-housing-migrant-workers/story-G72SlAfxtwp7JibJTRdt8J.html
22-05-2020||Gurugram||Manesar industry owners start drive to stop exodus of workers||The industry owners in Manesar on Friday started a drive to stop the exodus of the migrant workers by convincing them to stay back and appealing to them to join duty. Industry owners say that the shortage of workers has started negatively affecting the industrial activity in the region.In Gurugram, more than 3 lakh migrant workers are still waiting for their return to Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and other states. The IMT Manesar industry association has hired a vehicle and deployed two people to visit every village around Manesar over the next two days and talk to migrants to convince them to stay back.These workers were engaged as casual labourers in industries and construction work. After the national lockdown was announced on March 25 to stop the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19), they turned jobless. Additionally, the fear of catching the infection has made them restless to leave the city.According to sources belonging to Labour Welfare Fund, there are approximately 12.27 lakh labourers in Gurugram, a majority of whom have left the city over the past few weeks. Of the 1,100 odd industries in the district, the labour shortage now has begun showing its adverse impact on many.Pawan Yadav from IMT industry association said, “I have appealed to all migrants who were working in my factory to join duty but 70% of them are reluctant to join work and want to return home. Activities, such as loading and unloading of goods, housekeeping and security, have been badly affected by the labour shortage.Salary is not the issue here, but they have made up their mind to return because of the fear of Covid-19. We have started a drive to convince them that they are safe here with job, accommodation and schooling of their kids.”Starting Monday, the team would visit Udyog Vihar, Sector 34, 37 and other areas.Ravinder Goel, industry owner, Manesar, said, “This is a good idea as we are now trying to connect directly with migrants. We are suffering due to labour shortage now and the industry will be in a bad shape if they all move out. In the district, 70 to 80% workers are from the neighbouring states and they form the backbone of the industry and the construction business in the region.”The drive began with chanting of morning prayers, slogan or motto by a group of workers who have already joined the duties in factories at Manesar.“These workers have joined their duties and now they have decided to speak to their friends as a part of their commitment to the drive,” Yadav said, adding that industrial activities have been hit badly in the absence of casual workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/manesar-industry-owners-start-drive-to-stop-exodus-of-workers/story-6hKPKXQJpoxwnRxPlPwhrI.html
22-05-2020||Chandigarh||Amarinder announces relief measures for real estate sector||Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Friday announced a slow of relief measures for the real estate sector, including six-month extension in the permissible period for construction of plots and projects for all allottees, whether private or allotted by state urban authorities.The relief measures are applicable to all urban development authorities in the state, and will be restricted to the amount due from April 1, 2020 to September 30, 2020.In a statement, the chief minister said that notwithstanding the huge financial implications for his government, it has been decided to support the real estate sector, which has suffered major disruptions due to the Covid-19 crisis.Referring to the financial implications of the six-month extension in construction period, the CM said that since development authorities annually receive non-construction fee of nearly Rs 35 crore, this particular relaxation would lead to reduction in receipt to the tune of Rs 17-18 crore for all authorities put together.Amarinder also announced that all urban development authorities have been directed not to charge non-construction charges, extension fee, licence renewal fee for the period between April 1 and September 30.PAYMENT OF INSTALMENTSThe government has also allowed payment of instalments (including interest) of all auctioned properties due between April 1 and September 30, along with the remaining instalments, as equated instalments at the scheme’s rate of interest.Also, no interest will be charged on the instalments due between April 1 and September 30, and thereafter, the scheme interest will be charged on the amount due. “This particular relief can also be availed for post-dated cheques of amounts deposited against external development charges, licence fee, social infrastructure fund etc, under amnesty policy of November 28, 2019 payable up to September 15, 2020 (including those which were due on March 31, 2020,” said a government spokesperson.ALLOWS PHASING OF EDC PAYMENTAmarinder also gave concurrence to the proposal mooted by the Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) to allow phasing in payment of external development charge (EDC) as per the release of layout plans. However, rate of EDC payable will be applicable at the time of approval of layout plans. The spokesperson said, “Given the criticality and urgency of the situation, the chief minister, as chairman of the development authorities, has decided to announce immediate relief measures for six months, thus giving time to the authorities to come out with comprehensive long-term package. Post-facto approval of all the decisions announced by the chief minister would be taken by the authorities concerned at the earliest.”These urgent relief measures are in addition to certain incentives decided by the housing and urban development ministry, including extension by six months in the moratorium in payment of instalments in case of auctioned properties, the spokesperson said. The ministry has also decided that share of ownership can be transferred by urban development authorities in case of auctioned sites on proportionate payment plus 15%, subject to minimum transfer of ownership of 20% at one instance. Permission to sell specific built-up area marked on the layout plan can be given to developers thereafter, in the same proportion subject to having obtained the occupation certificate for such units.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/amarinder-announces-relief-measures-for-real-estate-sector/story-itS2YWmDOwI6w0X4aah6hJ.html

22-05-2020||City||Ggm: RWAs take steps to allow entry of visitors to societies||Gurugram: Residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) across the city on Friday initiated steps for allowing the entry of visitors to their colonies, a day after the district administration permitted guests’ entry into societies with riders.Issuing fresh guidelines for the fourth phase of the lockdown, the district administration on Thursday evening answered frequently asked questions (FAQs) for condominiums, societies, and residential sectors. Under the category “guidelines for visitors”, the administration said that entry of outsiders, including family and non-family visitors, are permitted, except those from containment zones. “However, they are subject to adequate social distancing protocols,” stated the administration’s order. On Friday, RWAs across the city started implementing the directions in a varied manner.For example, both Harmony in Nirvana Country and Princeton Estate in DLF 5 agreed to allow visitors, but from Monday onwards and on a regulatory basis. They both cited the need to prepare their staff to deal with the sudden influx of visitors for the delay.While Arati Pandya, joint secretary of Princeton Estate Condominium Association, said that the association would meet on Sunday to decide upon the best way forward to allow entry of visitors on a regulatory basis, Dipan Bhattacharyya, president of Harmony RWA, said that a maximum of four family members per house would be allowed to visit in a day, while non-family members would be permitted from June 1. “Apart from the fact that the district administration has given these directions, we also understand that our residents are eager to meet their family and friends during this difficult period. Hence, we have started taking steps to allow visitors inside our premises once again. However, we will be regulating their entry for the time being as it gives our staff time to get used to managing visitors keeping in mind social distancing norms,” said Bhattacharyya.Meanwhile, the RWAs of Belvedere Towers in Cyber City and Fresco in Sector 49 have started allowing visitors, provided they are wearing masks, have downloaded Aarogya Setu application, and their body temperatures are within the acceptable limit when checked by thermal scanners. “We have already implemented the administration’s direction from today (Friday) and informed residents that guests will now be permitted into the condominium. However, we have also informed them that large gatherings and parties cannot be held for the time being as this increases the chances of people catching infections,” said Nilesh Tandon, RWA president of Fresco Apartments. Vinod Giri, president of Belvedere Towers RWA, said that they will also be asking visitors for their address or the place they are coming from to ensure they are not from any containment zone in the city. In DLF phases 1 and 2, the RWA said that they are issuing an advisory to residents to only call visitors on an emergency basis, and they will also be submitting a representation to the district administration on this matter. “We are trying our best to ensure that residents only call visitors if there is a requirement or an emergency, and not for social gathering. While we are complying with the administration’s order and not stopping any visitor from entering the colonies, we are also trying to sensitise residents about the repercussions of calling visitors as more human interaction increases the chances of contracting Covid-19,” said Dhruv Bansal, spokesperson of DLF Qutub Enclave RWA. Bansal said that the RWA will also submit a letter to the district administration with their view of limiting entry of visitors into residential areas across the city and not allowing it on a full-scale.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ggm-rwas-take-steps-to-allow-entry-of-visitors-to-societies/story-aXRJC31QRj7GvypRZ2PDaJ.html
22-05-2020||City||Gzb: Private lab’s licence suspended for failing to inform district admin about Covid-19 patient||Ghaziabad: The licence of a private laboratory, which allegedly failed to inform the district surveillance officer about the status of a Covid-19 positive patient, has been suspended, health department officials said on Friday. “According to norms, the private lab was supposed to send a report to the Indian Council of Medical Research and also the district surveillance officer so that contact tracing of the Covid-19 positive patient could be initiated. However, it has been over 10 days since we received no report of the patient who works at an industrial unit in Sahibabad. So, a show cause notice has been sent to the lab and legal action will also be taken against the patient for hiding his health condition,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer (CMO).Gupta said that after the ‘missing’ patient, who was found positive for Sars-CoV-2 on May 7, came to light, the matter was referred to the police.“The police took up surveillance and the patient was traced in his house. He was admitted to the ESI Hospital in Sahibabad on Thursday. Our teams are now trying to trace his contacts and also areas where the patient might have visited ever since he was tested positive,” the CMO added.In another case, the officials said that a 20-year-old mentally challenged woman who was supposed to be admitted to women’s shelter home was inadvertently taken to a quarantine facility and admitted there.“The woman was brought by an ambulance and lodged at the quarantine facility at Dasna. She has been there for about 20-22 days, but not able to tell the whereabouts of her family. We have now contacted the district social welfare department so that she can be sent to the shelter home. Also, some mandatory tests have to be taken up before she can be moved to the shelter home,” Gupta said.Vikas Chandra, district probation officer whom the matter has been referred to by the health department, said that he has contacted a shelter home in Noida.“The shelter home is for women who are mentally retarded. Before the woman is transferred to the shelter home, she needs to undergo four tests – HIV, pregnancy, tuberculosis and Covid-19. Once these tests turn negative, the woman will be taken there on orders issued by a magistrate. We are coordinating with Noida officials in this regard,” Chandra said.On Friday, the Ghaziabad reported six new Covid-19 cases, taking the tally of positive patients to 208 in the district.“We now have 208 positive cases, of which 168 have been discharged so far. Overall, we have 38 active cases. Of the six cases on Friday, one each is from Khoda, Indirapuram, Sanjay Nagar, Muradnagar, Bhopra and from a locality near NH-9 (near ABES IT College),” CMO Gupta said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gzb-private-lab-s-licence-suspended-for-failing-to-inform-district-admin-about-covid-19-patient/story-axs4iNhNUY0e271uKtnjON.html

22-05-2020||City||Four men assault security guard over closed gates in Sector 51||Noida: A security guard employed by the Sector 51 residents’ welfare association (RWA) was allegedly assaulted by four unidentified people from Hoshiyarpur village on late Thursday night. According to the residents, the incident occurred around 11.30pm when the guard, Ratneshwar, was on duty at gate number 1 of the sector. A case has been registered at the Sector 49 police station.“He called us immediately after the incident and said that four people assaulted and threatened to kill him. The four came on two motorcycles from inside the sector and were going towards Sector 52 metro station. Near the gate, one of them disembarked from the bike and started abusing and assaulting the guard,” said Sanjeev Kumar, president of Sector 51 RWA who is also the complainant in the case.He said that one of them even threatened to shoot the guard if they find any of the sector gates closed from now on.“The guard was taken for medical treatment. He was on night duty with another guard. He said that the assailants had come to the gate earlier also and tried to get into the sector through closed gates. But they were asked by the guards to leave,” said Kumar.The RWA president further said that despite the restrictions on movement of people from 7pm to 7am, villagers are defying the lockdown guidelines constantly.“Strict action must be taken against those responsible for assaulting the guard. The entire incident has been captured in the CCTV cameras. Now, we want an increased police presence along with patrolling inside the sector. At least two of the attackers have been seen in the sector for morning walks and our staff recognize them,” said Kumar.The police said that they are trying to identify the suspects who assaulted the guard.“A case has been registered against the suspects under sections 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code. They will be nabbed soon,” said Dharmendra Kumar Sharma, station house officer, Sector 49 police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/four-men-assault-security-guard-over-closed-gates-in-sector-51/story-c2WnzD37soe6WuQ03jbiiM.html
22-05-2020||Noida||Engineer in debt ends life||A 35-year-old engineer employed with a private company allegedly took his own life at home in a high-rise in Sector 75 on Friday afternoon. The police did not recover a suicide note from the spot but they suspect financial troubles to be the reason.His neighbours reported the incident to the police around noon when they heard his wife shout for help.“By the time we reached, somebody had already broken down the door and brought down the body. The wife was hysterical. Their four-year-old son was in another room,” a neighbour of the family said.“We rushed a team to the spot and sent the body for an autopsy. According to the wife, he was almost ₹50 lakh in debt from various loans and bills and had been troubled about it for a while,” Dharmendra Kumar Sharma, station house officer, Sector 49 police station, said.The police also said that the man had lost a similar amount of money in the share market earlier this year, which added to the family’s financial woes. To pay off the loans, the man had borrowed money and was under pressure from money lenders and investors to pay it back, police said.“Both the husband and wife work as software engineers and have been working from home during the lockdown. They slept early in the morning after finishing their work and woke up around 10.30am. After a while, the wife went into the kitchen to cook when she heard the thud of a table falling and saw her husband hanging from a fan, after which she called for help,” the SHO said.The family has denied any recent arguments and financial problems seem to be the reason behind the death of the man, the police said. The body will be handed over to the family following the autopsy. Gautam Budh Nagar does not have a dedicated helpline to deal with such situations.

22-05-2020||City||Day 2: Most shops in Noida markets wear deserted look||Noida: Even as the city markets have reopened after a gap of almost two months, most shops are largely wearing a deserted look, with only the electronics stores emerging as an exception.On Friday, the second day of market reopening based on odd-even pattern, a number of shops, including the garment shops, at the city’s major marketplaces -- Atta market, Sector 18 and Sector 16 auto market -- wore a deserted look.While the traders are prepared for the slow recovery of the market, they also give restrictive timings for opening the shops and sealed state borders as one of the major reasons for low customer turnout.“A number of shop owners, staff and customers come to this area from Delhi. For an instance, the customers who live in Mayur Vihar and neighbouring areas prefer buying from Sector 18 rather than going to Delhi markets. Also, half of Noida is locked down and the timings are restrictive. So, there are a number of reasons for the low turnout,” said Sushil Kumar Jain, president, Sector 18 market association.Stating that full recovery may take around a year, Jain believes that the market will start recovering from the first week of June. “There are several issues, but we hope that the situation will improve within 10 to 15 days. Every businessman has suffered during the pandemic. However, we are thankful that the markets are now allowed to be open,” Jain added.Some traders, however, also claimed that their business never halted as they kept getting demands from several old customers and they had to operate through godowns. Such traders further said that with market properly opening they can resume the business without any issues.“The business in not so bad and we hope for a speedy recovery. A number of customers have been coming in to buy air conditioners, coolers, refrigerators, etc. Even during the lockdown, several customers had approached us for buying goods like AC and other electronics items and we had to deliver those through godowns. However, that was risky. Now, since the markets are officially open, the risk factor has gone,” said an electronics shop owner at Sector 18 market, who did not want to be named.As traders have to shut their shops by 7pm – which happens to be the time after which business starts to pick up during the summer season, shopkeepers believe the restriction on timings is another reason for low footfall.“Customers have started coming in for buying goods. We hope that business would recover soon. It would obviously take some time, as the odd-even is a bit confusing. The customers don’t know if the shop of the goods they are going to buy would be open or not in the first place,” said Gopal Maheshwari, another electronics shop owner, who had a good number of customers enquiring about different summer products.While pharmacy shops were anyways allowed to be open, those in Sector 18 market said that since Thursday the footfall has increased.“We specialise in health products. Though we were open earlier, the footfall was negligible because our shop happens to be in Sector 18. From yesterday, however, customers have started to visit the market,” said Ravi, who runs a shop selling health supplement products at the Sector 18 market.Ranbir Tanwar, a garment shop owner at Atta, hopes that things will recover soon.“Right now there are a very few customers in the market because shops won’t open in the evening. And chances of customers taking a stroll through the market in such warm weather in the afternoon are negligible. Have you ever seen Atta market so deserted? But this is all temporary, and things will soon recover,” said Tanwar.The Sector 16 auto market wore deserted look as well with only a handful of shops repairing and servicing cars while most of the market remained closed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/day-2-most-shops-in-noida-markets-wear-deserted-look/story-ToKmt2OOnU3sfTkbUpmQ6K.html
22-05-2020||City||Ghaziabad markets to alternately open through the week, says district administration||Five days after the Union home ministry released guidelines for lockdown 4.0, the Ghaziabad administration on Friday came up with rules for reopening 34 markets in the district on alternate days.A majority of markets, according to the directions issued, will open for three days a week till May 31, when lockdown 4.0 comes to end.In his directions issued on Friday, district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey, has stated that certain markets will open on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays while others will function on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays.“We have also given two working days to shop owners for taking up cleaning, sanitization and for making proper arrangement before opening of shops. During this period, they will have to ensure that all stale material is moved out as the shops have been closed for about two months now. Sunday will be an off day and no markets will open then. The corporation will also ensure that the markets are properly cleaned and sanitized once the garbage is removed,” Pandey said.As a pre-condition, the cleaning and sanitization by shop owners will be done only on days specified for them by the administration. If the cleaning is done on non-specified days, it will be termed as violation of the order, officials said.The major markets of Ghaziabad — Indirapuram, Vaishali, Sahibabad, Bjaria, Gandhi Nagar, Nehru Nagar, Mohan Nagar, Shastri Nagar and Turab Nagar, among others — will open on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays.The market which will open on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays will be ones in Vasundhara, Kaushambi, Raj Nagar District Centre, Kavi Nagar, Rajendra Nagar, Shyam Park, Raj Nagar Extension, Navyug Market, Ambedkar Road and those in Delta Colonies of Ramprastha, Brij Vihar, Surya Nagar and Chander Nagar.The officials added that vegetable shops, grocery shops, liquor shops and standalone shops will continue to open as per earlier specified timings. The directions issued will not be applicable in hotspots and containment zones, where only supply of essentials will be allowed.“The shop owners will operate with 50% staff and will make arrangement for sanitizer for customers . Any customer not wearing mask or covering their face will not be catered to. The shop owners will also ensure that a separation of at least 6 feet is maintained between consumers to ensure social distancing,” the district magistrate added.Traders’ association members, however, said that they held a meeting with administrative officials on Friday evening and raised some issues.“We spoke to the officials about sweet shops and other shops selling items of daily consumption. We have requested them to allow such shops to open on daily basis otherwise the material will become stale and unusable. Likewise, we also sought directions regarding building material shops. The officials told that we should open markets and necessary changes will be taken up at a later stage after another round of meeting,” said Pradeep Gupta, convener of Vyapari Ekta Samiti – Indirapuram.“We don’t find much relief in the order as the shops will effectively open from Monday and two working days will be devoted to cleaning and sanitization. We will lose customers on account of Eid festival which is on May 25. There has been a delay on part of officials to release the order for reopening the markets. This should have ideally been done on May 18 or 19 after the lockdown 4.0 guidelines were issued,” said Rajneesh Bansal, chairman of Turab Nagar Vyapar Mandal.The administration officials said that the movement of commuters between Ghaziabad and Delhi and between Ghaziabad and Noida will continue.“There is no change in the order for commuters who are travelling to Delhi or Noida,” said Santosh Kumar Vaishya, additional district magistrate.The administrative officials also said that there is no likelihood of any order as regards to the movement of domestic helps, plumbers, mechanics and technicians,in highrises. Different RWAs have raised the issue and had been requesting the administration for give directions about entry of such persons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-markets-to-alternately-open-through-the-week-says-district-administration/story-53WhVTiGCKXj2xFGApRYdL.html

He and Rajkumar, a colleague of his, were kept under institutional quarantine at the Galgotias on April 19 after they gave their samples for a Covid-19 test at the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) in Greater Noida. The person was admitted to GIMS on April 19 for a few hours and was later that day sent to Galgotias quarantine facility.On April 23, the suspect coughed up blood after which he was sent to the Sharda Hospital in an ambulance and that was the last the quarantine centre people heard of him. Between May 11 and 19, the family members and his employers got in touch with the Galgotia University quarantine in-charge Dr Anil Gupta enquiring about the man’s whereabouts. After Gupta received multiple calls, he decided to check with the Sharda Hospital authorities to find out when the man had been discharged.Gupta was informed that no such patient was admitted on April 23 after which he went and checked all hospital entries and the CCTV footage from the premises. “I went through all the patient details and the CCTV footage of Sharda Hospital, but the man never reached there,” Gupta said.“I then went to GIMS to find out if by mistake the man was taken there by the ambulance, but there was no record of him there as well. When I asked GIMS for his test reports, the staff there said there said the results are yet to come,” Gupta said.Gupta also checked the records of the district hospital in Sector 30 but nothing could be found there. He then went through all the postmortem reports done in the district over the last three weeks.“I found out that there were four autopsies of unknown persons, of which two were above the age of 50, so they were ruled out. The remaining two bodies were found in the jurisdiction of Dankaur police station and Sector 58 police station. I asked the police to send me the panchnama (case) pictures. The pictures didn’t match with the suspect,” Gupta said.Gupta then visited the site manager and the man’s colleague Rajkumar who was discharged on April 26 after his reports came negative for Covid-19.“Rajkumar confirmed that the person was sent to Sharda Hospital in an ambulance on April 23. He had left from our premises and nobody from the hospital ever contacted us again until his colleagues and relatives got in touch with me,” Gupta said.A missing person report was registered with the Dankaur police on Thursday on Gupta’s complaint. “We have spoken with Rajkumar and his family members. Investigation has started. We are yet to find the ambulance which took him from the quarantine facility. Authorities have no record of the ambulance that ferried the man,” Akhilesh Pradhan, station house officer, Dankaur, said.“There are 34 ambulances in the district which are involved in the Covid-19 fight. Each ambulance makes around 50 rounds a day. At times, there is more than one patient in the vehicle and the ID of only one patient is taken to register the entry. We have checked all the details but there was no ID with the name of the missing man,” Gupta said.The Sharda Hospital authorities have provided all documents and CCTV footage to the police. “The man never reached our hospital. There is no mention of any such man in our records. We have provided our CCTV footage, but there is nothing there,” Dr Ajit Kumar, joint registrar and media spokesperson, Sharda University, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/covid-suspect-taken-away-in-ambulance-goes-missing-quarantine-centre-notices-only-after-three-weeks/story-OVpnFQIVevYVdDdDFKkLVP.html

22-05-2020||Noida||Trade union workers protest against changes in labour laws, demand salary for lockdown period||Trade union workers on Friday protested against changes made to the labour law and demanded full salaries for the lockdown period. Although the union leaders were arrested by the police, workers held protests in different areas of the district on Friday.“The CITU (Centre of Indian Trade Unions) president Gangeshwar Dutt Sharma was arrested on Thursday midnight. On Friday, on the All India Trade Union’s call, several workers held protests in their localities while maintaining social distancing. We have protested the changes in labour laws and has demanded salary for our workers for the lockdown period,” Ram Sagar, general secretary, CITU, a left-leaning traders’ body, said.“Earlier, we had sent letter to the deputy labour commissioner and higher authorities highlighting the non-payment of salaries to workers during the lockdown period. Several workers have complained that they were not given salaries for 25 days of March for which they had worked prior to the imposition of the nationwide lockdown on March 25,” Sagar said.“During the initial phases of the lockdown, though the permitted strength of workers was one-third the total staff strength of a unit, from May 3, all units have been running at full staff strength. But workers were disgruntled when they got no salary credited to their accounts for the month of April,” he said.Several workers residing in Delhi, Ghaziabad, Hapur and other areas could not come for work as they were not allowed to cross the borders and enter Noida, despite having a permission letter from the district magistrate for their unit to function and management’s letter issuing passes to such workers. Salaries of these workers too were deducted for a number of days that they could not come to work, the union leader said. Some workers were allowed to adjust these days against permitted leaves.“Non-essential product industries were not allowed to operate during lockdown. But as per guidelines, workers in these units too were to be given salary for the lockdown period, but a majority of such industries have not paid their workers,” Sagar claimed.Deputy Labour Commissioner PK Singh said, “We are receiving more than 200 complaints every day regarding non-payment of salaries on the online grievance cell. Once lockdown is removed and the situation improves, there will be a flood of such complaints. We have sought directions from the government on such cases. Legal action against the defaulting companies will be taken as per the law for violating state government guidelines.”There are at least 12,000 factories in Noida, 8,000 units in Greater Noida and at least 3,000 in areas under the UP State Industrial Development Corporation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/trade-union-workers-protest-against-changes-in-labour-laws-demand-salary-for-lockdown-period/story-IeBti7YJVixpsM4mp0RaTL.html
22-05-2020||City||Covid-19 impact: Poor campus placement at GB University||GREATER NOIDA: The Covid-19 outbreak in the country has jeopardised the job prospects of many students of Gautam Buddha University (GBU). The recent graduates looking for their first job feel marooned due to the dismal campus placements at the varsity’s management and engineering departments this year.Only 30% students could get job offers from various companies, which mostly conducted interviews before the nationwide lockdown was announced. According to GBU officials, of 400 management and engineering graduates, only around 120 of them could manage to get job offers through campus placement this year. During the lockdown period (from March 25 to May 20), only four students could manage to get job offers through online interviews, said the officials. Restriction on movements and ban on events badly affected the campus placement schedule at GBU.“The placement at Gautam Buddha University’s management and engineering departments would have been much better this year if Covid-19 pandemic had not impacted the season so badly. We somehow managed to invite six private firms to conduct the online interviews during the lockdown period. In March last year, the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) had set up a mega job fair at campus and students got jobs. And it was scheduled in March-end this year too. But it could not happen due to the lockdown,” said Abhinav Sharma, an officer at corporate relation cell of GBU. Last year, the university had witnessed 75% campus placement for management and engineering students, as companies such as Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Paytm, Oyo Rooms, S&P Global, Curefit India, HCL, Honda, Oppo and NTT Data offered jobs to students. In 2018, the campus placement was 70%. Students who took education loan for their study are troubled a lot with no offer at hand.“I took an education loan of Rs 4.5 lakh. So not getting a job at campus is more troublesome to students like me. I hope online job events may help in future. The Covid-19 pandemic has badly affected the job market, as many companies are not so eagerly hiring,” said Praduman Kumar Siddharth, a native of Prayagraj who just completed his MBA. However, the placement cell at GBU is not disappointed and trying hard to help the students get jobs.“The university, in association with FICCI, now plans to conduct an online internship job fair on May 30. As per the curricula, most university students are required to generate grades via interning in the industry and corporate houses during the summer break. Because of restricted movements and reduced activities, such an online internship fair can prove to be vital for the students for getting a job,” said Sharma. At least 25 companies will take part in the internship fair to be held through the website www.gbujobs.com, said the GBU officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-impact-poor-campus-placement-at-gb-university/story-G1RFHOIbH4roSY5vWOVoiI.html

22-05-2020||Delhi||DFS procures its first drone with thermal cam to track people trapped in high-rises||This summer, before the number of fire incidents escalates, the Delhi Fire Service (DFS) has started training its men to handle its first drone to monitor fire better, especially in the Capital’s high-rises. Senior officers said the drone has a thermal imaging camera to track people trapped inside a burning building and can help investigators generate a 3D image of the building to recreate the incident.Between April 2019 and March 2020, as many as 282 people were killed in 27,859 incidents of fire reported in Delhi. In 2018-2019, 297 people lost their lives in 31,264 fire incidents.Every year, the months of May, June and July see the maximum fire incidents across the city. Atul Garg, director, DFS, said that keeping in mind the challenges they had to face, especially while dealing with a fire in high-rise buildings, they purchased their first drone in March this year.“We were operating with limited staff because of the lockdown; so we couldn’t train our men on how to use the drone effectively. We have now started the training and before the number of fire incidents increases this summer, like every year, we expect some of our men to be experts in handling the drone to support our firefighters,” he said.The drone that the DFS has procured can fly as high as a 60-storey building and can cover an area as wide as four kilometres at one go. It will be very helpful in cases of fires breaking out in high-rises as it will give the firefighters an aerial view of the situation and they can identify its source to effectively contain the blaze, Garg said.He added that the drone is fixed with a thermal imaging camera, which can scan a burning building and help the firefighters identify where people are trapped. “With this, even those who are unconscious due to smoke inhalation can be easily tracked and pulled out. We are sure it will increase our effectiveness in saving lives... if only we had this technology during the Anaj Mandi fire and Arpit Palace fire,” Garg said.The director added that several times when lives are lost in fire incidents, Delhi Police is handed over the probe. “In most cases that require investigation, we need to recreate the scene and develop a three-dimensional image of the building. The drone will capture videos and images of a building from all sides and will help us prepare a 3D model, which will be effective during the police probe,” he said.Garg said that for now, they have purchased only one drone but the DFS plans to buy more soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/dfs-procures-its-first-drone-with-thermal-cam-to-track-people-trapped-in-high-rises/story-UkDWgME5fTddEMQTuMOl6H.html
22-05-2020||City||At least 200 jhuggis gutted, hundreds left homeless in Kirti Nagar fire||New Delhi: At least 200 shanties were gutted after a fire broke out in the Chuna Bhatti slum cluster in west Delhi’s Kirti Nagar on Thursday night. While no casualties were reported in the incident, hundreds were left homeless, officials of the fire department said.According to the Delhi Fire Services (DFS), they received a call reporting the fire around 11.30pm on Thursday. DFS director Atul Garg said they rushed 10 fire tenders to control the blaze. “Because the fire was spreading fast, we pressed in more tenders. The final count of tenders used touched 30. At least 100 of our firefighters struggled for over four hours to control the fire, which could only be contained by 3.30am. The process of cooling the spot was on till morning,” Garg said.Nearly 200 shanties and slums were destroyed in the fire, as per the fire department’s estimates. We are yet to ascertain the cause behind the blaze, Garg said.The colony is beside the Kirti Nagar railway station, with several industrial units in its vicinity.Gokul Kumar, a resident of the slum cluster said the spark erupted from a nearby factory unit around 11.15pm, and spread to the entire neighbourhood within minutes, leaving residents no time to save their belongings. While some of the residents tried to douse the blaze till the fire tenders arrived, the situation was beyond their control.“We could either save ourselves or our belongings. Many people in this colony are already having a tough time financially because of the pandemic, many have lost their jobs and families are struggling to survive. This fire has just added to our miseries,” Kumar said.Sumukhi Sengupta, who works with the NGO Jagruk, said at least 150 residents of the cluster have lost their homes. Most residents were moved to government shelters on Friday.“We have been helping residents collect whatever is left of their belongings.

22-05-2020||Delhi||Provide beneficiaries with 1kg pulses in accordance with PM food scheme for 3 months: HC to Delhi govt||The Delhi High Court on Thursday directed the Delhi government to provide the beneficiaries of the PM Garib Kalyan Ann Yojana with 1kg pulses as per the scheme for three months, May 16 onwards, in accordance with a plea contending that the city government was not providing them with the enhanced benefits of this Central government scheme.A bench of justices Manmohan and Sanjeev Narula also asked the Delhi government to ensure that all fair price shops display information regarding the entitlement of food grains in accordance with the provisions of the Targeted Public Distribution System (Control) Order, 2015.The court pronounced its order while hearing a plea by one Ramya Kutty, filed through her advocate Shivam Goel, seeking directions to the city government to ensure the proper distribution of pulses under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Package or PM Garib Kalyan Ann Yojana (PM-GKAY) or any other applicable scheme among the residents of Delhi as per their entitlement.On Thursday, Goel told the court that subsequent to the filing of the plea, the Delhi government has started dispersing pulses in accordance with the scheme from May 16. He, however, contended that the distribution of pulses (1kg per family) should have commenced w.e.f. April 1, 2020 in accordance with the aforesaid scheme. He also contended that the fair price shops were not displaying information regarding the entitlement of food grains in accordance with provisions of the Targeted Public Distribution System (Control) Order, 2015.Appearing for the Delhi government, its additional standing counsel Anjum Javed filed a status report stating that the distribution of pulses under PM-GKAY for the month of April, 2020, could not be done due to quality issues with the supply of pulses from NAFED.Now, with the replacement of stock with good quality pulses at all fair price shops concerned, the distribution of pulses for the month of April, 2020 began on May 16. He said that in two days (May 16 and May 17) pulses have already been distributed to 1,71,865 households.“Distribution of Pulses for the months of May and June, 2020 under PM-GKAY will be taken up subsequently after the distribution of pulses for April, 2020. As regards, distribution of Pulses under PM-GKAY, allocation of Pulses for the month of May, 2020 has already been generated and allocation for June, 2020 is being made (sic),” the Delhi government report read.Following this, the court directed that the pulses be given to the beneficiaries of the scheme for three months, according to the March 26 directions of Centre, in which it announced the details of the PM-GKAY scheme and ordered states to implement it.“There was a problem with the quality of pulses which Delhi had earlier received. That had caused some delay. The issue is now resolved. All court directions will be adhered to,” a senior government official confirmed on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/provide-beneficiaries-with-1kg-pulses-in-accordance-with-pm-food-scheme-for-3-months-hc-to-delhi-govt/story-YWBj3fPrR5xKv04z5zOkgP.html

22-05-2020||Mumbai||HC directs state, BMC to consider a helpline for pregnant women after lockdown||The Bombay high court on Friday directed that the state and the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to consider setting up a separate helpline for pregnant women after the lockdown period. The directions were issued after a petitioner brought to the notice of the court that a pregnant woman had to deliver her child at home with the help of a midwife as she was turned away by three hospitals and a maternity home. The BMC had been asked to submit a list of maternity homes and clinics and the number of deliveries done there since the lockdown. The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice S S Shinde made the suggestion while hearing a PIL filed by advocate Mohiuddin Vaid. Vaid had referred to a news report wherein an expecting woman was refused admission to J J hospital on April 27, as she did not have a Covid-19 negative report. The petitioner had sought directions to the state and civic bodies to put in place appropriate measures for pregnant women during the pandemic.While the state refuted the news report and said that five pregnant women had been admitted on April 27, the BMC on the May 15 directions of the bench submitted an affidavit enumerating the names and particulars of maternity homes and clinics in the city that were attending to pregnant women. The list contained the names of maternity homes and clinics attending to COVID-19 and non–Covid patients including pregnant women and number of deliveries conducted by medical institutions since the lockdown was enforced.Senior counsel Anil Sakhare, for the BMC, said that the information was available on the dashboard of its website and also submitted that a dedicated Covid helpline number 1916 had been started.When the petitioner demanded that there must be a separate helpline for pregnant women, the BMC submitted that it would not be possible as the 1916 helpline was already being handled by 12 doctors in three shifts.After hearing submissions, the bench accepted the contentions of the BMC and disposed of the PIL noting that in future, the BMC and state government should consider setting up a separate helpline for pregnant women.The affidavit filed by the corporation with regards to the deliveries conducted during the period of lockdown stated, “there have been 3905 deliveries in March, 4169 deliveries in April and about 2412 deliveries till the date of affirmation of the affidavit, of which about 359 patients tested positive for COVID-19. Such COVID-19 positive patients have been treated in special facilities.”In light of the submissions in the affidavit, the court held, “The number of deliveries performed during the past three months provides reason to hold that the contentions urged by Sakhare and Chavan are sound and that there has not been any reported incident of negligence does not call for judicial intervention on this PIL petition.”The court however observed, “ We, therefore, dispose of this PIL petition expressing hope and trust that the State and Corporation shall continue in its efforts to ensure that expecting ladies are well attended to even in these testing times and that maximum care is taken so that not only the mother but the newborn child does not face difficulties till such time normalcy is restored.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-directs-state-bmc-to-consider-a-helpline-for-pregnant-women-after-lockdown/story-i5kgGSHQRqoMKHbRQofGIJ.html
22-05-2020||Chandigarh||Big Bazaar fined ₹12,000 for charging two customers ₹18 for carry bags in Chandigarh||The District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum has penalised Big Bazaar for asking a customer to pay ₹18 for a cloth carry bag in two separate cases. The forum has directed the retail chain of hypermarkets to pay ₹10,000 to the consumer legal aid for both cases, and ₹1, 218 to each consumer.In the first case, Bharat Dawar of Sector 34, Chandigarh, filed a case against Future Retail’s Big Bazaar store in Industrial Area here. He alleged that in March 2019, he had bought some articles from the store and at the billing counter, the cashier had asked him to pay ₹18 for a carry bag.He said he resisted buying the bag but in vain. Terming it an unfair trade practice, he moved the consumer court, he added.Big Bazaar in its reply said the amount for cloth bag was “rightly charged” as it was displayed in their store. “The complainant had consented to be given a carry bag for an additional charge.”Denying the allegation, it added, “Through advertisement /posters/notices clearly displayed at prominent locations of the concerned store stating that as a part of its responsible and environmentally conscious business policy, consumer are requested to carry their own bags and that a separate charge was to be charged in case the consumer wished to obtain a new carry bag.”However, the forum observed that if Big Bazaar claims itself to be responsible and environmentally conscious, they should have given the carry bags to the customers free of cost “because in our considered view, the price of the carry bag has generally been included by them in the profit margins of the product(s)”.“By employing unfair trade practice, Big Bazaar is minting lot of money from the gullible customers from all their stores situated across the country. Therefore, the deficiency in service as well as unfair trade practice on their part is proved,” it observed.It directed Big Bazaar to return ₹18, pay ₹100 as compensation for harassment and mental agony and ₹1,100 as litigation cost. Apart from this, Big Bazaar has been asked deposit ₹5,000 in consumer legal aid.In the other case, a Panchkula resident, Sourav Kumar, complained that in March 2019, the store had charged ₹18 from him for a carry bag. A similar order was pronounced by the consumer forum in this case as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/big-bazaar-fined-12-000-for-charging-two-customers-18-for-carry-bags-in-chandigarh/story-xfCC81UXwvpFyytCymL4uO.html

A video of the incident was circulated on social media. A worker engaged in a sanitation exercise along the road was seen spraying disinfectants on the migrant workers standing in queues.In response, SDMC said it happened mistakenly because the worker could not handle the pressure of the jetting machine.“Since the school is in a residential colony, there was huge demand from residents for disinfecting the compound and the road. But due to the pressure of the jetting machine, the worker could not manage it for some moments. The staff has already been instructed to be more careful and attentive while doing the job in future. The official present at the site apologised to public,” SDMC said in a statement.The Union ministry of health and family welfare had in April issued an advisory against spraying disinfectants on people for Covid-19 management. The ministry had said spraying chemical disinfectants is “physically and psychologically harmful”.The SDMC, however, said disinfectant spraying is being done as per protocol and guidelines. It said the civic body had distributed food and water to migrant workers who had come for screening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/disinfectant-sprayed-on-migrant-workers-in-lajpat-nagar-mcd-says-by-mistake/story-2Rh9zcfQmcKAKrgr3rKBRK.html

The state further said that the requisite instructions had also been issued to local authorities to allow the movement of veterinary ambulances, and to allow authorised persons to ferry pets and strays in private vehicles in case ambulances were not available.The affidavit further stated that instructions had also been issued for allowing feeders to feed strays by issuing them requisite permissions and passes.When the petitioner insisted that the Animal Welfare Board, in a letter to the petitioner on May 5 and in April, had stated that pet owners could take their pets out for a walk, the state responded that after perusing the letters, no such recommendation was found, and on the contrary, the board had directed to arrange facilities for taking care of domesticated animals that would be abandoned by their owners during the pandemic. The state affidavit also pointed out that the instructions by the board were only addressed to the Pune municipal commissioner which was “surprising”. After hearing the submissions, the bench asked the petitioner to respond to the averments of the state and also sought to know under what authority could the board issue directions and posted the matter for hearing on May 29.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-seeks-clarity-from-activist-over-animal-welfare-board-taking-care-of-pets-during-lockdown/story-MQhYzUuLJKIhNXEldTlbRK.html

He said, “If there is any lack of trust or alienation in any section of the population, it should be addressed. Another step can be restoration of 4G internet. Once the Covid-19 lockdown is relaxed, Jammu and Kashmir should be given statehood and fresh elections should be held.” Based on his stint in Jammu and Kashmir, he spoke on the evolution of proxy war in the erstwhile state over the last three decades. He said we need to accept the fact that a resident of Jammu and Kashmir was as patriotic as any other Indian and positive stories needed to be highlighted in media from the region to build trust.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/focus-on-conflict-resolution-to-solve-border-disputes-former-western-command-chief/story-UuYZrJwaivCSxWSV8ZYedJ.html

Three people have been named as accused by the victim’s family members. Superintendent of police Himanshu Garg said, “The prime motive behind the murder will be established after the accused are arrested.”Station in-charge Satpal Singh said, “Rashpal’s family says three men are involved in the murder. A case under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code has been registered. The autopsy report is awaited.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sarpanch-s-husband-shot-dead-in-yamunanagar/story-UagtptBP1XBhwzDqHI10fN.html

On Friday, the Chandigarh Tent Dealer Society wrote to the UT adviser seeking relaxation in the lockdown rules and financial aid.Anil Vohra, adviser of the body and president of Chandigarh Beopar Mandal, said, “Other businesses have started reopening, but there is no scope for tent dealers even in the coming months as people will avoid organising big functions.” He said, “During March and April, the business booms for tent dealers. But all events were cancelled due to the lockdown, causing huge damages to tent houses.”Ramesh Kumar, proprietor of Durga Tent Services in Sector 23, said, “We had reopened our shop on May 3, but till date no one has contacted us, which is discouraging. All traders have lost at least 20-25 contracts between March and May.” Amandeep Singh, who owns Dhir Tent and Decorators in Sector 41, said, “Upon cancellation, people also demanded their advance payments back. Many people had organised events in March, but haven’t paid the full amount, and it is unlikely that they will pay their dues anytime soon.”Jagtar Singh, president of the society, said in their letter to the adviser, they had sought that the EMIs of business loans should be deferred at least by six months and its interest should be waived. They also sought that after the lockdown gets relaxed, interest free loans should be allowed to the traders for at least a year and GST charges for services should be brought down from 18% to 5%.“We have also asked the administration to consider increasing the limit of guests at weddings from 50 to 100 to help tent houses get contracts, while they will ensure that all safety norms are followed,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-tent-house-traders-seek-admn-s-aid-to-salvage-business/story-O7Oc7AmBea54GsFl2cM4gO.html

22-05-2020||Chandigarh||Panjab University contractual employees await salaries for three months||Contractual employees of Panjab University (PU) have not been paid their salaries for three months, leaving them struggling for finances amid the nationwide Covid-19 lockdown. One of the employees requesting anonymity said, “Around 12 contractual workers have not been paid salaries since February. Our contractor says he will pay us only after he gets money from the university. We have already taken up the matter with PU and also requested the authorities to disburse our salaries.”“It was only after a multiple requests to PU authorities that we received salaries for February and March a few days ago,” said a plumber working in the university.Meanwhile, on Saturday, Panjab University Campus Students Council (PUCSC) joint secretary Manpreet Singh Mahal wrote a letter to PU vice-chancellor requesting him to look into the matter. Condemning the treatment being meted out to the contractual employees, Mahal said the council had made the request and asked the university authorities to disburse their salaries. Contractor JS Tanwar, however, said he could not do anything as the university had not processed his bills and not made any reimbursement since January. “I have followed all rules and regulations of the contract. Once PU authorities reimburse the amount, I will pay the employees right away.”PU executive engineer RK Rai said, “We have released reimbursements of February and other bills are also under process.

22-05-2020||City||Leopard rescue in Junnar saves cat drowning in open well||PUNE The effect of the Covid-19 lockdown has resulted in wild animals venturing out into the quiet, open streets across Maharashtra.In one such case in Otur village in Junnar, an adult, male leopard fell into a 45-foot-deep well and it took the timely intervention of the Wildlife SOS team and the Maharashtra forest department to rescue the wild cat.The leopard’s panic-stricken roars woke up villagers in Khodad, Otur, as the animal was struggling to stay afloat.“The villagers are accustomed to seeing leopards on occasion, living as they do in close proximity to the scrub jungles that serve as the leopard’s natural habitat. In situations like this, their first instinct is to call the forest department and the Wildlife SOS team at the Manikdoh leopard rescue centre in Junnar,” said Yogesh Ghodke, regional forest officer, Otur. He added, “I am glad that timely intervention helped save the leopard’s life. This is a common occurrence as leopards often fall into open wells while foraging. We have advised the villagers to take precautionary measures by covering the wells.”The villagers systematically cordoned off the area and lowered a makeshift platform for the leopard to climb onto for temporary support. On arrival, the rescue team quickly rolled out the extraction plan and lowered a trap cage into the well. After a few attempts, the leopard successfully climbed into the trap cage and was rescued.Kartick Satyanarayan, co-founder and CEO, Wildlife SOS, said, “These are very difficult times for the world, but that will not stop us from providing aid to both wildlife and communities in need. We are grateful to the villagers and forest officers for making this rescue a success. The collective efforts of the teams have in the past led to many such operations to mitigate man-leopard conflict in the region and helping wild animals in distress.”Nikhil Bangar, wildlife veterinary officer, Wildlife SOS, said, “Such operations require patience and careful planning to ensure that we don’t cause any further stress to the animal. The leopard is unhurt and is a healthy male, approximately seven-years-old. The leopard is no under temporary observation.” Maharashtra is a stronghold for the leopard population in India, but over the years, these elusive wild cats that once roamed freely across the vast terrains of the Western Ghats have had to adapt to the ever-changing landscape; a direct result of human induced factors like habitat destruction, rapid urbanisation and encroachment of forested areas.The Indian leopard, which is listed as ‘vulnerable’ under the IUCN Red List, has an estimated figure of 12,000-14,000 in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/leopard-rescue-in-junnar-saves-cat-drowning-in-open-well/story-FZ4TNJ9wIdzATJ2kC01Y3O.html
22-05-2020||Mumbai||Yes Bank fraud: Kapil, Dheeraj Wadhawan to remain in ED custody till May 27||The special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court on Friday extended the custody of Dewan Housing Finance Limited (DHFL) promoters Dheeraj Wadhawan and Kapil Wadhawan to Enforcement Directorate (ED) till May 27 in connection with a money laundering case linked to YES Bank.The brothers were arrested on May 14 and are since then in ED’s custody. The agency sought the extension of their custody on the ground that the case involves voluminous documents and that the two brothers are not cooperating with the investigating team.ED initiated proceedings against the Wadhawans based on a first information report (FIR) registered by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on March 7 against the two brothers and Yes Bank promoter Rana Kapoor, after which the DHFL promoters moved the Bombay high court seeking anticipatory bail. However, a single bench of justice Bharati Dangre had rejected their pleas stating, “In view of the serious allegations of money laundering, with a deep-rooted conspiracy entered into by Wadhawans with several others, particularly YES Bank promoter Rana Kapoor and his family members, call for their custodial interrogation.”As per allegations made by the agency, YES Bank has invested ₹3,700 crore in DHFL’s short-term non-convertible debentures between April and June 2018, for which Kapoor has received kickbacks worth ₹600 crore as loans to DoIT Urban Ventures (India) Private Limited. Kapoor’s daughters hold 100℅ stake in DoIT Urban Ventures Private Limited, while Morgan Credits is controlled by his wife.The judge also said that only the applicants can throw light on the nature of transactions and the alleged that the conspiracy can be cracked only by interrogating them over the rolling of funds in the sister companies by deciphering their accounts.The applicants will have to be confronted with various incriminating documents, with respect to the loans sanctioned in its favour by YES Bank, as well as those sanctioned by DHFL in favour of Kapoor, so as to unearth the multi-crore conspiracy, the judge observed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/yes-bank-fraud-kapil-dheeraj-wadhawan-to-remain-in-ed-custody-till-may-27/story-UcXMz9hb3qmMQ5Q4JIc7qO.html

22-05-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19 victims can’t be deprived of decent burial, says HC||Covid-19 victims cannot be deprived of the right to a decent burial, especially when there is no evidence to suggest that cadavers can spread the virus, the Bombay high court said on Friday, while dismissing a petition filed by four Bandra residents seeking prohibition on the burial of Covid-19 victims at three inter-connected Muslim cemeteries in the vicinity of their residence.The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice SS Shinde said in Parmanand Katara’s case the Supreme Court has held that the right to dignity and fair treatment under Article 21 of the Constitution is not only available to a living man but also to his body after his death.“Right to a decent burial, commensurate with the dignity of the individual, is recognized as a facet of the right to life guaranteed by Article 21 of the Constitution,” said the bench referring to the apex court decision. “There is, thus, no reason as to why an individual who dies during this period of crisis because of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection would not be entitled to the facilities he or she would have otherwise been entitled to but for the crisis,” the bench added.The four petitioners had challenged the validity of a circular issued by the BMC commissioner on April 9 identifying the three inter-connected Muslim cemeteries as sites for burial of Covid-19 victims.They complained that the cemeteries were at the heart of Bandra west and were surrounded by thickly populated residential areas.They said on March 30, the BMC had decided to cremate bodies all Covid-19 victims at the nearest crematorium, irrespective of their religion. “The said decision was taken as the burial grounds in Mumbai are in highly dense localities, with high chances of contamination in dense residential areas nearby,” said their petition.They added that the April 9 circular was completely contrary to the March 30 decision and therefore prayed for an order restraining the civic body from allowing the burial of any Covid-19 victim at the three Muslim cemeteries.The state government had opposed the petition by pointing out that burial at the cemeteries was not likely to spread the deadly virus in surrounding areas.“It is declared by the World Health Organisation that coronavirus is not air bound and hence transmission of the virus to other people staying in the vicinity of the burial ground is highly impossible,” said the government.“The transmission cannot happen unless people in the locality come in direct contact with the dead body brought for burial or cremation,” it said, adding, “Direct contact of people staying in the locality with a dead body is impossible as the dead body is wrapped in plastic by hospital staff before handing over the body to its relatives for cremation.”BMC supported the government stating WHO guidelines on bodies of Covid-19 patients “clearly stipulate that except in cases of haemorrhagic fevers (such as Ebola) and cholera, dead bodies are generally not infectious. Only the lungs of patients with pandemic influenza, if handled improperly during an autopsy, can be infectious. Other than the above, cadavers do not transmit the disease.”The high court accepted their contentions. The bench said in the system of governance prevailing in our country, it is highly unlikely that a Governmental decision would please each and every citizen. “While dissent on valid grounds could contribute to newer developments in the matter of framing of policies, resentment of the nature put forth by the Petitioners in WP-I leaves a bad taste in the mouth,” it said while dismissing the petition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-victims-can-t-be-deprived-of-decent-burial-says-hc/story-AgujSpeZ7ftHcqduz1EISM.html
22-05-2020||Mumbai||TISS group starts fund-raising campaign to pay fees of 17 scholarship students||A students’ group at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), Mumbai, has started a fund-raising campaign for 17 students who were unable to pay their outstanding fees owing to the Covid-19 lockdown. The 17 students are beneficiaries of the Government of India- Post-Matric Scholarship (GoI-PMS) and haven’t been able to arrange funds as there is a delay in the disbursement of their scholarship.The campaign aims to raise Rs 5,22,090 to pay the students’ outstanding fees. They have raised about Rs 87,000 so far. HT had previously reported that student bodies on campus have been demanding a waiver of outstanding fees, which includes tuition fee, dining fee and hostel fee, of graduating students belonging to scheduled caste (SC), scheduled tribe (ST), other backward classes (OBC) and economically weaker sections (EWS). The institute didn’t accept this demand owing to a funds crunch.The students couldn’t even check their results as the institute has withheld results of those with outstanding fees. One of the students is a 2019 graduate and hasn’t been able to get this degree as he hasn’t paid. Failure to pay fees might affect students pursuing a Masters degree. “The institute’s financial inability to waive the fees and the state’s lag in allocating GoI-PMS scholarship, has stopped our further journey beginning from TISS. We cannot even get our Masters degree as we haven’t paid the fees,” said Goutham Raj Konda, who completed his course in Urban Policy and Governance but is unable to check his results as he has an outstanding amount of Rs 23,000. The institute has indicated that any kind of waiver-- partial or full-- was not possible, given its financial health.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/tiss-group-starts-fund-raising-campaign-to-pay-fees-of-17-scholarship-students/story-6rVFTPRgsDd4IeLHhkyGeM.html

Sagar was killed in an explosion a decade ago and now Anoop lost his life to a militant attack,” said a relative Veeru Singh.His other two brothers have retired from executive police and fire services posts.Anoop was in the 10th battalion of Indian Reserve Police and posted in Pulwama.A resident of Pulwama’s Shadipora village, he is survived by his wife and four children – two daughters aged 22 and 18 and two sons aged 19 and 15. While his wife is a homemaker, the eldest of his daughters is in college and a son is studying in an ITI. The other two children are in school.According to his colleagues, Anoop was quite passionate about the education of his children.“He was very particular about the education of his children, especially his daughters. He wanted them to excel and become officers,” said one of his former colleagues.Mourning Anoop’s demise like the other villagers, his neighbor Randeep Singh said, “He was one of the humblest persons I have ever met. He would always greet everyone with a smile and respect young and old alike.”“People here are concerned about his children. We request the government to make arrangements for their education and employment,” he said.Singh and one of his colleagues were injured on Thursday afternoon when suspected militants fired indiscriminately upon a joint party of security forces at a checkpoint in the Prischoo area of south Kashmir’s Pulwama district. Police said the duo was evacuated to a nearby hospital where Anoop succumbed to his injuries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/slain-kashmiri-sikh-cop-second-of-4-brothers-to-lay-down-life-in-militant-attack/story-LwKxOpdGFkYUA7X7U1dshJ.html

22-05-2020||Mumbai||BMC cries foul over zero stars in Swachh Survekshan league 2020’s garbage-free city rating||Challenging Swachh Survekshan league’s zero star rating to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) in the garbage-free city section, the civic body has written a letter to the Centre pointing out loopholes in the rating process. The results of the rating were declared by the Centre this week, wherein BMC failed in one of the parameters of “sweeping of public, commercial and residential areas”. The BMC challenged the evidence uploaded by the third-party auditor on the basis of which the ratings were given. In its letter, a copy of which is with HT, BMC has also questioned the credibility of the third-party auditor.The BMC had applied for a five-star rating in the garbage-free city section in Swachh Survekshan League 2020, following which a team of third-party auditor visited the city for a survey. The team submitted a photo which showed a garbage pile up and was the basis for the zero-star rating. The BMC in its letter has challenged the authenticity of the photo stating that the evidence is tampered with.The garbage-free city rating is a prelude to the announcement of rankings for Swachh Survekshan-2020. The final rankings are likely to be announced after the lockdown is over.A senior civic official, requesting anonymity, said, “The physical site shown in the photo and the location marked does not match at all. Also, the metadata of the photo reveals that the image was modified in March. The evidence is clearly tampered with.”Hinting that such tampering may deter the city to participate in surveys, the letter stated, “Such tampering of evidence is unacceptable and raises a grave concern on the third-party auditor, data compilers and the results declared without request for clarification. This is tremendously disheartening for the morale of city staff and in future may deter the cities from participating in such activities.”Mumbai was ranked 49th among 425 cities in the 2019 Swachh Bharat Survekshan, a steep fall from its 18th rank in 2018. The Swachh Survekshan 2020, conducted by the central government, ranks cities across the country on the basis of cleanliness at public places.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-cries-foul-over-zero-stars-in-swachh-survekshan-league-2020-s-garbage-free-city-rating/story-wYIh7PN8sNnRdwQTlTKc8J.html
22-05-2020||Chandigarh||Mercury breaches 40°C mark in Chandigarh||City’s maximum temperature crossed the 40 degrees Celsius mark on Friday, touching 41.9 degrees, four notches above normal.According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the mercury will continue to rise further in the coming days.Speaking about the jump, scientist at IMD Chandigarh, Shivinder Singh, said, “Earlier North-Westerly winds from Pakistan and Kashmir were blowing in the region, keeping it cool. But, now winds from Rajasthan had made their way to the city, causing a considerable increase in the temperature. It will rise by another 1-2 degrees in the next few days.”Singh added that the dry spell was likely to continue in the region, which will contribute to the rise in temperature. “Cyclone Amphan, though far from the north, drew in winds from across the region and drained out the moisture. This has led to heat waves in some parts of India.”Heat wave in plains is declared when the maximum temperature goes over 45 degrees or is 4.5 degrees above normal.Friday’s maximum temperature at 41.9 degrees was 2.2 degrees more than Thursday’s 39.7 degrees. The minimum temperature also went up from 21.8 degrees to 22.1 degrees, one degree below normal. In the next three days, the day temperature will remain between 42 and 43 degrees, while the minimum temperature will be around 24 degrees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/mercury-breaches-40-c-mark-in-chandigarh/story-ljFVaxBLsKmJb0nkKUoLHK.html

22-05-2020||Kolkata||Cyclone Amphan inundates Kolkata’s College Street, deals fresh blow to book business||After cyclone Amphan lashed Kolkata bringing in heavy rain, water entered closed outlets of booksellers, publishers and binders of the historic College Street, and damaged printed books and pages ready for binding, causing losses to the tune of lakhs of rupees, an official said on Friday.The apex body of publishers and booksellers of the state said they will soon hold a meeting and may have to seek help from the state government to bail them out as the cyclone dealt a fresh blow to the business after the two-month-long lockdown.“If you consider the waterlogging inside publishing units and shops which caused serious damage to printed books, the losses could be into lakhs,” Apu Dey, a key member of the Publishers and Booksellers Guild, told PTI.“However, if you also take into account the seeping of water book binding units as well, where printed pages are bound in volumes, the losses can be more, may run into a crore,” he said.Dey said the COVID-19 induced lockdown had stalled publications before the Bengali New Year on April 14, and now cyclone Amphan has turned things difficult for publishers and book sellers of College Street.Dotted with makeshift bookstalls along both sides of the road, College Street is a one-of-a-kind book market in the world that draws locals and tourists alike from every nook and cranny of the globe.According to an estimate, around 100 big and small publishers and over 200 shops sell books on various subjects - fiction, non-fiction, text books, second-hand books. Besides, there are stalls that sell all paper stationery items.Images of books floating on the waterlogged street on Thursday morning have gone viral on social media.“Our world is tremendously affected. The first attack was by Covid-19, followed by two months of lockdown and then Amphan! Thousands of books kept in locked book stores have been soiled,” Guild President Tridib Chatterjee said.The Deb Sahitya Kutir, an old publishing house, said it has incurred heavy losses as thousands of printed pages ready for binding were damaged, besides printed books, as water seeped below closed shutters.“We are not in a position now to calculate the losses.It will take months to recover,” Rupa Majumder said on behalf of the Deb Sahitya Kutir.A 50-something man was seen sitting near his pavement stall staring at textbooks that got soaked and damaged in rainwater.“I am finished,” he uttered.While some publishers and store owners could rush to College Street to check the damage done by the cyclone, many who live in the districts could not as trains are not running because of the lockdown, said Dey.The history of College Street goes back to the time when the Hindu College was established in 1817, which was later renamed as the Presidency College.Other major educational institutions also came up along the stretch during the 19th century.While the Calcutta University was established in 1857, the Hindu School came up in 1817, the Hare School in 1818 and the Sanskrit College in 1824.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/cyclone-amphan-inundates-kolkata-s-college-street-deals-fresh-blow-to-book-business/story-J5p4dCUOLrp8r44wkV7sgL.html

As he remained asymptomatic, the hospital authorities decided to discharge him. He was told to stay in home isolation for at least a week. Gulati added that such patients are discharged only if the family members or relatives give proper undertaking that the patient will remain in home isolation and will not step out of house. “We also remain in contact with the care taker of the patient for supplying medicine. So, proper procedure is followed before discharging the patient. It is the negligence of the patient that he had stepped out of home,” he said.PATIENT WAS ‘HONOURED’ BY VILLAGERSOn Thursday, some photos of the patient getting honoured by villagers surfaced on social media. In the picture, there were around 10 persons standing with the patient as he accepted a ‘Siropa’ from them.

22-05-2020||Mumbai||School chain tells staff to take leave without pay||Teachers of a school chain that operates in Mumbai have alleged that they have been asked to take leave without pay by the school authorities in the middle of the Covid-19 crisis.Teachers working in various branches of Narayana e-Techno school have alleged that the school management told them that they could not be paid for the next few months due to financial constraints. “We were told that the school was facing financial issues due to the current situation and that our salaries won’t be paid for the next few months until schools reopen,” said a teacher from the school’s Bhayander branch. The school chain runs five branches in the city and 12 branches in the state. Along with the teachers, members of the non-teaching staff have also been reportedly told to take leave without pay from May. “Nearly 150 people including teaching and non-teaching staff are affected due to this sudden decision of the management. Many of them are single earning members in the family and this has put immense pressure on them and their families,” said another teacher on the condition of anonymity. Pathan Sayed Khan, head of academics for the Mumbai region at the school said that no teacher is removed from the rolls so far. “We have not removed anyone and will not do so even in future unless there is some issue with respect to their teaching. Some teachers were not willing to teach online as a result of which we asked them to take a break. Especially in Maharashtra, parents are not paying fees due to economic reasons and we are thus having some temporary financial difficulties,” he added. Teachers, however, said that they were willing to teach online but said that they were never given that option. “We were not even told that this can be an option. If given a choice nobody would want to lose their job,” said the teacher from Bhayander.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/school-chain-tells-staff-to-take-leave-without-pay/story-6PT5kOigf4dFj0Vq2OXE1L.html

The funds will be provided out of the State Disaster Relief Fund.The move comes two weeks after the private school teachers’ body wrote to J&K Lieutenant Governor G C Murmu requesting financial assistance. The administration has directed the J&K education department to prepare a list of teachers requiring financial aid. An order issued by the administration stated that the assistance may be provided on details of the fee charged by such schools. The order further stated that the detailed information in this regard shall reach the department within a weeks’ time.The letter submitted to the L-G by Kashmir private schools association president G N Var reads “Schools have been badly hit since August 5 after the abrogation of Article 370 and in the present circumstances most schools are on the verge of shutting down due to financial crunch resulting in irreparable loss to the society at large”.Var said that 65,000 teachers and the allied staff were currently affected in J&K. “There are no regular salaries for all the teachers. Only a few schools are paying wages to their staff while the remaining are suffering,” he said adding that the administration must also consider the non-teaching staff for relief.The education department had last week urged all private schools to defer fee collections from students in view of nationwide lockdown.Requesting anonymity, a principal from a private school in the city said that he took a loan of ₹70 lakh to pay the salaries of the teaching staff.“I have not received my salary since the lockdown was enforced. I am unable to feed my family as all my savings have exhausted,” said a private school teacher from Srinagar.However, the administration has decided to provide one-time financial aid to teachers after the L-G held a review meeting with the officials of the education department recently. Principal secretary to the government (higher education department) Asgar Hassan Samoon said, “We may provide funds to the needy teachers from L-G or labour funds.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/j-k-admn-to-give-one-time-financial-aid-to-private-school-teachers/story-Ps3hsm1LkiqJeQJ5QERfrN.html

Around 11am, Nallasopara resident Shanu Shinwar, 35, entered the pond to catch fish. His son Durvesh, and neighbour Sumedh Khandare, 25, waited for him on the banks. When the duo was unable to spot Shinwar after a while, they dived into the water to search for him. When the two did not come out of the pond either, some locals called the fire brigade, an eyewitness said. Fire brigade personnel then conducted rescue operations and fished out one body and sent it for post-mortem to Nallasopara Primary Health Centre, a personnel said. As the body was decomposed, they could not identify if it was Shinwar or Khandare’s.“We have deployed divers to look for the other two missing persons, as we presume that they may be stuck somewhere in a corner of the pond. We are using submersible pumps to drain the water so that we can trace them,” the fire brigade personnel said.Meanwhile, the Nallasopara police have registered a case of accidental death and are probing further. The police said that despite warning the locals and placing barricades around the pond, the locals continue to enter the pond.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/fishing-trip-ends-in-tragedy-as-man-drowns-in-nallasopara-pond-while-2-others-go-missing/story-ajDNN5xwtn3qjtPfwgeDeI.html

Uttar Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (UPSRTC) buses were deployed for bringing them back, but the number of students there was more than our estimate and we needed additional buses,” UPSRTC Managing Director Raj Shekhar said.“The buses of Rajasthan Roadways available in Kota were used for ferrying students till Agra and Mathura. The bill for the same was raised by the Rajasthan Roadways which has been cleared by the UPSRTC,” he said.UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s media advisor Mritunjay Kumar had strongly condemned the demand of Rs 36 lakh, saying it only showed the “inhuman face” of the Rajasthan government.In April, thousands of students from Uttar Pradesh who were preparing for various competitive examinations in the coaching hub of Kota in Rajasthan were brought back to their homes in buses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-govt-clears-rs-36-lakh-bill-sent-by-rajasthan-govt-for-return-of-students-from-kota/story-vuMPWrFqgATz4UUuco3XhO.html
22-05-2020||Mumbai||State biodiversity board dysfunctional without chairman, non-official members, says forest minister||The nodal body to promote, plan, and implement biodiversity conservation issues in Maharashtra has been dysfunctional for the past four months. The Maharashtra State Biodiversity Board (MSBB) has been functioning without a chairman and non-official members and has major decisions regarding the declaration of biodiversity heritage sites (BHS) across the state pending. The details were revealed on the International Day for Biological Diversity (May 22) proclaimed by the United Nations to increase awareness on biodiversity issues.Earlier this week, HT reported that the state board for wildlife (SBWL) had not met in 17 months resulting in key development projects, wildlife mitigation measures, and other crucial decisions being stalled.State forest minister Sanjay Rathod said he was aware about the matter. “We will be taking up the issue of both boards before the chief minister soon as he is the final authority to sanction their reconstitution. These are crucial bodies that enhance environment protection, but owing to the Covid-19 pandemic there has been a delay,” he said.Established under the Biological Diversity Act, 2002, the state biodiversity boards advise respective states on the status of biological resources, overlook the functioning of biodiversity management committees at the municipal or panchayat level, grant approvals for commercial use of resources, and identify biodiversity heritage sites based on proposals and submit them for final declaration to the Centre. State boards function under the larger ambit of the National Biodiversity Authority under the Union environment ministry.The tenure of the last board ended in September 2019, while the previous chairman retired during the last week of January. On January 30, MSBB official members from the forest department had published advertisements calling for applications for the appointment of chairperson and non-official members. “The application submissions were received by our Nagpur office by March 2 and the documents are currently pending with them,” said Vikas Jagtap, officer-in-charge, MSBB. Senior forest officials of the board, based out of Nagpur, refused to comment on the matter.“MSBB is an extremely important body that the state requires, especially to assess the ecological services, protection of water resources, and climate stability among other factors,” said Vilas Bardekar, former chairman, MSBB.Meanwhile, final declaration of five biodiversity heritage sites in Maharashtra — Anjarle and Velas beaches in Ratnagiri district, Ganeshkhind in Pune, Landorkhori Reserve Forest in Jalgaon, and Wardham in Sironcha, Gadchiroli — have been pending since 2018. The first and the only BHS in Maharashtra at present is the six-hectare forest patch, Glory of Allapalli, Gadchiroli. It was notified in July 2014. “While final documentation for some sites is pending, a few proposals are awaiting final nod from the Centre,” said a senior state government official.Declared and Proposed Biodiversity Heritage Sites in StateBiodiversity heritage sites are locations with biological, ethnic and historical value that have fragile ecosystems. To strengthen biodiversity conservation, these areas are marked as heritage sites under the Biological Diversity Act, 2002.1.

22-05-2020||Mumbai||Bombay high court upholds professor, clerk’s dismissal, says hearsay evidence acceptable in departmental inquiry||There is no prohibition on using “reliable and acceptable” hearsay as evidence in departmental proceedings against erring employees, the Bombay high court (HC) said on Tuesday, while upholding the dismissal of a professor and a library clerk of a Dombivli college.The professor and the clerk had moved HC after the University and College Tribunal, Mumbai, on January 27, 2016, upheld their dismissal from service in July 2013. They were dismissed after the inquiry officer found them guilty of insubordination, dereliction of duty, and suspected intimate relations between the two.However, the petitioners contended that they were actively raising grievances of the employees of the college, which did not go down well with the institute’s management. They further claimed that the action taken against them was out of the vindictive attitude of the college management and had also challenged the departmental action against them as well as the order of the University and College Tribunal on various grounds.Justice CV Bhadang, however, found no substance in their challenge, and said their dismissal was based on certain technical issues of a peripheral nature and that there was no serious challenge to the findings of fact recorded by the inquiry officer.The judge also rejected their arguments that a report prepared by a private detective – employed by the clerk’s husband – could not have been used as evidence against them in the departmental proceedings. They also claimed that the report was nothing but hearsay, as the author of the report – the private detective – was not examined as a witness against them.Justice Bhadang said it is now well settled that strict rules of evidence do not apply to a departmental inquiry and there is no prohibition even on acting on hearsay evidence in a given case, if it is found to be reliable and acceptable.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-high-court-upholds-professor-clerk-s-dismissal-says-hearsay-evidence-acceptable-in-departmental-inquiry/story-oOHVeAaeQz6KDXIv3029hM.html

They will be paid Rs 750 a day.On Thursday, too, a large number of women had thronged the hospital to apply for the post of nurse. Hoping to avoid a repeat, this time, the hospital had introduced a token system, but to no avail. The eager job aspirants jostled against each other as they queued up for the walk-in interview.Civil surgeon Dr Rajesh Bagga said, “We made announcements asking people to maintain distance. We called the police and also introduced the token system. What else can we do? People just won’t listen.” He said applicants from other districts also visited the city to file their application, which compounded the problem.Meanwhile, the rising temperature took a toll on four applicants who fell unconscious while standing in the queue. Fortunately, they were revived and none of them required hospitalisation. They were offered juice and sent back home. GRADUATES, POSTGRADUATES APPLY Several graduates and postgraduates also applied for the post. They said the prolonged lockdown had rendered them jobless. “I was working as a salesman in Chaura Bazaar but lost my job due to the lockdown. I have to do something to earn a living. One of my friends told me the administration was hiring youngsters at daily wage so I decided to apply,” said Gurpreet Singh, while standing in queue.Butta Singh, who was working in a cloth manufacturing unit located at Bahadurke Road, also said the COVID-19 crisis had rendered him jobless.“I am a graduate so hopefully they will prefer my application over others,” said Butta Singh.The civil surgeon office is located near Session Chowk, which houses the residents several judicial officers, bureaucrats and police officials, including commissioner of police Rakesh Agrawal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/social-distancing-thrown-to-the-wind-as-5-000-vie-for-post-of-ward-attendant-in-ludhiana/story-juJCLOaLCNLZHpTdXfHDNP.html

22-05-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana sees 3-fold increase in Coronavirus cases during May, majority being from NCR||Haryana has recorded a three-fold increase in coronavirus cases this month, majority of them being reported from four districts falling in the National Capital Region.The cases have jumped from 339 as on April 30 to 1,031 on May 21. The coronavirus cases in Gurgaon, Faridabad, Sonipat and Jhajjar, which fall in the NCR, jumped from 54, 53, 25 and 24, respectively, as on April 30 to 239, 181, 150 and 91 by May 21, according to data put out by the state health department in its daily bulletins. Eleven of the 15 Covid-19 deaths which the state has reported so far took place during the month of May. On May 4, Haryana had recorded the highest single-day jump in coronavirus cases when 75 infections were reported and a day earlier the state had reported 66 infections, most of these from the NCR districts. The number of active cases in the state have gone up from 100 on April 30 to 335 on May 21. Commenting on the spurt in Covid-19 cases in the NCR, Health Minister Anil Vij said the people living in districts which are closer to Delhi have also been affected. There are a total of 12,319 coronavirus cases in the national capital, according to authorities. Haryana has maintained that several cases reported from Sonipat, Jhajjar, Gurgaon, Faridabad and even Panipat have their origins in infections emanating from the national capital, following which authorities had put strict regulation on borders with Delhi to check the spread of infection. Though essential services and movement of doctors, paramedical staff and some others as per orders of the Delhi High Court have been allowed. “We had to put strict regulations on our borders with Delhi to check the spread of infection. We have nothing against the people of Delhi, but we have to protect our own people too,” Vij said. The health minister said over three weeks ago several cases were reported in NCR districts “as infection spread in our vegetable markets in Gurgaon, Sonipat, Jhajjar and Faridabad, whose origins were from Delhi”. “I keep saying this repeatedly that more relaxations are being given but we will have to remain cautious and make changes in our daily lives as per the demand of the present situation,” he said. “Wearing masks and observing social distancing need to be followed. However, I have suggested that we should have laws which will make not wearing masks and violating social distancing norms a punishable offence,” Vij added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-sees-3-fold-increase-in-coronavirus-cases-during-may-majority-being-from-ncr/story-dzrZhH3aOET06eK5man3QI.html

22-05-2020||Patna||Bihar reports 10th Covid-19 fatality; infection tally reaches 1,987||The total number of Covid-19 cases in Bihar soared to 1,987 on Thursday, when 211 people tested positive for the coronavirus, as the health department declared a 55-year-old man, who died at a hospital two days ago, as the state’s tenth fatality due to the disease.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageAccording to State Epidemiologist Ragini Mishra, the deceased belonged to Khagaria district and died at the Sadar hospital in Begusarai.“His test reports came late Wednesday night, confirming he was infected with the coronavirus,” she said.The district’s health society programme convenor Shailesh Chandra said the cause of the death was cardiac arrest.The state has previously witnessed deaths of nine Covid-19 patients – two each from Patna and Vaishali and one each from Munger, East Champaran, Sitamarhi, Rohtas and Khagaria.Meanwhile, the state health department said 211 people tested positive on Thursday, raising the state’s total to 1,978.The central Bihar district of Jehanabad reported the highest 50 cases, six of them females.

Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has been insistent upon raising the number of samples tested every day to 10,000 as Bihar braces for more arrivals of migrants.More than seven lakh migrants are currently lodged at thousands of quarantine centres set up across the state at district, block and panchayat levels, said state Information and Public Relations Department secretary Anupam Kumar.He also said that 85 special trains, carrying close to 1.40 lakh migrants, reached Bihar on the day and another 1.43 lakh are scheduled to arrive on Friday by 87 Shramik Specials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/bihar-reports-10th-covid-19-fatality-infection-tally-reaches-1-987/story-MEvWZqYsIdcvfKvMiC8bzK.html

22-05-2020||Gurugram||Migrants face heartbreaking queries from their children||Mohan Jha, a migrant labourer from Bihar, called his family excitedly to inform that he was finally boarding the train back home but was left numb with his five-year-old’s question -- “Is it Diwali already?” He did not have the heart to tell his son that they might not be able to celebrate the festival this year as he had no work.Jha, who worked as a construction worker in Sohna near Gurgaon, has been out of work since the lockdown was announced to contain the spread of Covid-19. Struggling for nearly two months and managing to eat at community kitchens, he was finally able to board a train this week to Muzaffarpur in Bihar.“I was trying to go back since two months. After a long wait my chance to board the train finally came. I called home in relief and my son asked if it is Diwali time already that I am coming back home. He had several questions about why is Diwali coming in summer this year. I felt heartbroken. I could not tell him that there may be no Diwali this year as there is no work,” he told PTI. “I am sure he might be expecting that I will be getting gifts for him too but I will have to disappoint him for some time now,” he added. Refusing to be clicked, Jha said, “My misery cannot be captured by any camera. All the world has to offer us is sympathy and nothing more.” Bharat Babu, who worked at the same construction site, said, “For our children, we are only home when it is Diwali or Chath time. They are too young to understand why are we making this surprise visit back home or that there may be no going back. The virus will deprive us of many Diwalis it seems”. While the government has permitted construction activities, the labourers say its not the same work for them on the ground. “The contractors say there is no raw material and government has also given extra time to finish construction so there is no hurry. If the contractors still keep us, they will have to pay our balance, so nobody wants to keep us for now,” Babu said. Sharing the same concerns, 42-year-old Manjhi Kumar said, “I have been in Gurgaon for seven years and I was planing to bring my family here this year. My son was very excited about studying in a city school but all of those plans will have to be put off now. Don’t know if I myself will come back here or will look for work there only.” “I had saved some money but now all of it is being used as there is no new income. My wife who used to work as a domestic help is also out of work. How long will we survive on the limited savings,” he added. Over 40,000 migrants left for Bihar’s Muzaffarpur, Barauni and Kishanganj on Thursday from different places in Haryana through Shramik Special Trains. According to the Haryana Chief Minister’s Office, so far over 2.38 lakh migrants have been sent home from the state. The country has been under a lockdown since March 25 to contain the spread of virus and the lockdown has now been extended till May 31. Throwing economic activities out of gear, the lockdown rendered many homeless and out of money, beginning an exodus of migrants to their home states. While trains and buses are being arranged for them, lakhs of them continue to wait for their “chance” as they struggle to make ends meet. “I had registered as soon as the trains were announced and I managed to get my chance after struggling for weeks. I had no other option than to wait,” Manjhi Kumar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/migrants-face-heartbreaking-queries-from-their-children/story-Qs6CzpxNNPYASBa2CICBEL.html
22-05-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC upholds BMC’s power to identify cemeteries for burying Covid-19 victims||The Bombay High Court on Friday said the Brihanmumabi Municipal Corporation, BMC, had the authority to identify Muslim cemeteries for burial of Covid-19 victims and issue circular regarding it. A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice SS Shinde dismissed a petition filed by four Bandra residents challenging the validity of the BMC circular of April 9, 2020, which identified some Muslim cemeteries in thickly- populated areas for burying those who died of the coronavirus disease. The petitioners had moved high court complaining that three inter-connected Muslim cemeteries identified for burial of Covid-19 victims were in the heart of Bandra west, surrounded by thickly-populated residential areas. They contended that there were high chances of spread of coronavirus from the burial ground in nearby residential areas. All the four petitioners reside in the vicinity of the private Muslim cemeteries. However, the HC bench said there was no scientific material supporting the petitioners’ apprehension that coronavirus can spread through cadavers. In their plea, the petitioners had said the BMC on March 30 decided to cremate bodies of all Covid-19 victims at the nearest crematorium, irrespective of their religion. “The said decision was taken as the burial grounds in Mumbai are in densely-populated localities, with high chances of contamination in residential areas nearby,” said their petition.They added that the subsequent circular of April 9 was, however, completely contrary to the March 30 decision and therefore prayed for an order restraining the civic body from burying any Covid-19 victim in the three Muslim cemeteries.The state government, however, maintained that burial at the cemeteries was unlikely to spread the deadly virus in the vicinity of the burial ground.“It is well established and declared by the World Health Organisation that coronavirus is not air bound and hence transmission of the virus to other people staying in the vicinity of the burial ground is highly impossible,” said the government.“The transmission cannot happen unless people in the locality come in direct contact with the dead body brought for burial or cremation,” it said, adding, “Direct contact of people staying in the locality with dead body is impossible as the dead body is wrapped in plastic by hospital staff before handing it over to the relatives for cremation.”The Mumbai civic body supported the government, stating WHO guidelines on bodies of Covid-19 patients “clearly stipulate that except in cases of haemorrhagic fevers (such as Ebola) and cholera, dead bodies are generally not infectious. Only the lungs of patients with pandemic influenza, if handled improperly during an autopsy, can be infectious. Other than the above, cadavers DO NOT transmit the disease.”The Mumbai HC bench accepted the submissions of the state and BMC, said advocate Pratap Nimbalkar, who represented the Navpada Masjid, Bandra and Santacruz Golibar Dargah Trust which manages the private Muslim cemeteries.The bench said there was no scientific material supporting the petitioner’s apprehension that coronavirus will spread through cadavers, Nimbalkar added. Besides, the bench also noted that the civic chief was legally empowered to issue the circular and identify cemeteries for burial of Muslims dying due to coronavirus infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-upholds-bmc-s-power-to-identify-cemeteries-for-burying-covid-19-victims/story-Z3OHgF49b4WH67jPO6EUDK.html

However, the demand has not gone down well with the BJP’s top brass. The BJP legislators who raised the demand are Dharamshala legislator Vishal Neharia, Jawalamukhi legislator Ramesh Dhawala and Nurpur legislator Rakesh Pathania.State party chief Rajeev Bindal says had ‘taken serious note of the demand raised by three BJP legislators: “The demand for convening the Vidhan Sabha session is uncalled for. It was due to the coronavirus crisis that the budget session of the Vidhan Sabha was cut short. The crisis has still not resolved so there is no need to convene the Vidhan Sabha session.”“All big meetings and religious gatherings have been restricted in the wake of the coronavirus crisis. Thus, there is no point in convening a special Vidhan Sabha session,” he said. “Chief minister Jai Ram Thakur is making concerted efforts to deal with the Corona -19 crisis,“ said Bindal. The BJP legislators had called on Vidhan Sabha speaker Vipin Singh Parmar and demanded a special session. “It was not a delegation led by leader of opposition Mukesh Agnihotri. All legislators had gathered at the Vidhan Sabha premises to attend a meeting of the Vidhan Sabha committee. We did not demand that an immediate session be convened. The Covid-19 crisis can be discussed later, “said Rakesh Pathania. The three legislators also issued a joint statement underlining the need of an immediate Vidhan Sabha session.

22-05-2020||Delhi||Healthcare workers against revised govt guideline on quarantine, launch black ribbon protest||Healthcare workers treating Covid-19 patients in government hospitals designated for the treatment of patients with coronavirus disease are protesting after being asked to vacate quarantine facilities as per the latest guideline by the Union health ministry.Under the previous guideline, all doctors, nurses, technicians and sanitation workers in the Covid-19 wards had to work 14 days in a row and remain in quarantine for the next 14 days to ensure that they did not take the infection back home.The revised guideline from the union health ministry on management of manpower in the hospitals issued on May 15 said that there was no need for quarantine of healthcare workers after Covid-19 duty, unless there had been a breach in the personal protective equipment or any other form of high-risk exposure.The Federation of Resident Doctors’ Association (FORDA) has called for a black ribbon protest on Friday demanding proper quarantine for all healthcare workers on Covid-19 duty.A circular from Delhi’s Lady Hardinge Medical College issued on Thursday states, “Hotel facility during post-duty period in Covid-19 and suspected Covid-19 zones provided to healthcare workers is hereby withdrawn and the occupants are directed to please vacate their rooms immediately. If any overstay is noticed, charges paid for the overstay will have to be recovered from their salaries.”The accommodation will be available to those still on Covid-19 duties at the hospital.“This is happening across the designated Covid-19 hospitals after the union health ministry guidelines were issued. The problem, however, is that even if someone is asymptomatic, they might pass on the infection to their hostel-mates or family members. We have seen in some cases staff testing positive during the second round of testing between day 11 to 14,” said Dr Sunil Dhuchania, president of the resident doctors’ association of the hospital.A similar notice was issued to the healthcare workers from Lok Nayak hospital, the biggest Covid-19 treatment facility in Delhi with 2,500 beds. “In an order yesterday, those in quarantine were asked to vacate the hotels or dharmashala rooms by Thursday noon. However, we had a meeting with the medical director and they have been given a week’s time to vacate the facility,” said Dr Parv Mittal, president of the RDA at Lok Nayak hospital.For future batches of healthcare workers, the hospital will make arrangements for those working in high-risk areas such as the intensive care unit has to follow the quarantine protocol. “Although the directions from the ministry and Delhi government is to provide quarantine only to those considered to have been high-risk contacts during their duty by the hospital infection control committee, we will be making arrangements for those working in ICUs to still continue the quarantine,” said a senior official from the hospital administration, on condition of anonymity.A similar compromise was worked out by the doctors at Dr Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) hospital in Delhi.“An extension has been provided for the current batch of people who finished their duty in mid-May. After that, we are in talks with the medical superintendent to at least provide quarantine for seven days so that the healthcare workers do not take back the infection to their elderly parents or young children,” said Dr Ekta Yadav, president of the RDA at RML hospital.“However, we are hoping that the health ministry takes back these guidelines by the time the next shift ends,” she said.Doctors at Safdarjung hospital have negotiated a five-day quarantine for healthcare workers in the Covid-19 wards, so that they can be tested once before they go back home.“At the hospital level, our medical superintendent has allowed five-day quarantine for healthcare workers from the Covid-19 wards, so they can stay in the hotel till they are tested once,” said Dr Manish Kumar, president of the RDA of Safdarjung hospital.The All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), which caters to the second-highest number of Covid-19 patients, is following the health ministry guidelines and is providing quarantine to only those who are recommended by the hospital infection control committee. The dharamshalas of the hospital, which are used by the relatives of the patients usually, were being provided to the healthcare workers from the hospital.“We are following the health ministry guidelines,” said Dr DK Sharma, medical superintendent of the hospital.The guidelines define “high risk exposure” as a healthcare worker treating Covid-19 patient or handling their samples without proper personal protective equipment (PPE) or probable breach of the PPE. It will also be required if a healthcare worker is in contact with a positive person at a distance of less than 1 metre for more than 15 minutes without masks, face-shields or goggles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/healthcare-workers-against-revised-govt-guideline-on-quarantine-launch-black-ribbon-protest/story-fsPbszvgUWdZfealUg6sZK.html

22-05-2020||Lucknow||Tiger carcass found in Pilibhit Reserve||The decomposed carcass of a tiger was found in Pilibhit Tiger Reserve (PTR) on Wednesday. This is the second big cat to die in the forest range in the last 15 days. In the last census, PTR had just over 50 tigers. A couple of weeks ago, an adult tiger, which was attacked and injured by villagers in Pilibhit, died during a botched rescue attempt by forest department officials.According to reports, on Wednesday evening, the forest department found the decomposed and “almost dried up” carcass of the adult tiger in the Khakra compartment of the Mahof forest range in the PTR.Field director of PTR, H. Rajamohan, said a part of the tiger’s body was eaten up by wild animals. “Nails and almost all the teeth are intact in the carcass. This suggests that it was not killed by poachers. The carcass seems to be over one week old,” he said.With this, PTR has lost three adult tigers since April 4. Two of them are dead, while one was sent to Kanpur zoo.The field forest force has been directed to conduct combing operation in entire area to collect the clues about the tiger’s death.The National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) has nominated a representative to be present during the post-mortem for assessing the causes leading to tiger’s death and submit an independent report.Autopsy of the big cat will be conducted on Thursday in PTR by a panel of doctors from Bareilly’s Indian Veterinary Research Institute. The designated representatives of the NTCA as well as chief wildlife warden of Uttar Pradesh will be present there.The Pilibhit Tiger Reserve, according to the last census, had just over 50 tigers.Meanwhile, Lucknow-based wildlife enthusiast Kaushlendra Singh, has written a letter to the principal secretary, forest department, Sudhir Garg, asking him to explain the special measures taken by the state government to protect the tigers in the PTR and other protected sanctuary.“Why did the field forest force of PTR fail to trace the carcass for more than one week, especially when the spot was a junction point of two states?” he asked and added, “This lapse is concrete evidence that the claims of PTR officials of carrying out round-the-clock combing in wild are false.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/tiger-carcass-found-in-pilibhit-reserve/story-XYfPUboPKzq9rrHMVqikhL.html

Those personnel who get infected with the coronavirus while on duty will now get Rs 10,000 instead of Rs 1 lakh announced earlier as the number of infections have increased rapidly in the force, officials said on Thursday, reports news agency PTI. “A meeting was held recently and it was decided that the sanction amount should be reduced.

22-05-2020||Delhi||Sadar Bazar ponders its place in Covid-19 era||These days Rakesh Yadav, a trader in Sadar Bazar, spends a significant time every day discussing with his fellow businessmen how to reopen the market and conduct business in the post–Covid world. He says in Sadar Bazar, a warren of narrow streets, always jam-packed in normal times , social distancing is an impossible proposition—and so is the odd-even formula the government has proffered. He explains why: Sadar Bazar, India’s largest wholesale market of household goods, has about 40,000 shops; each one has about 3-4 workers/salesmen. Then there are thousands of thelawalas, daily wage labourers, loaders, luggage careers, rickshaw drivers, jostling for space in its lanes. On an average, Yadav says, there are 2. 5 lakh people in the market on any given day.“The traders feel opening the market is a monumental risk , and they are reluctant to take it,” says Yadav, who is also president, Sadar Bazar Trades Association. Among the proposals, he points out, the traders have floated during endless rounds of tele- and video conferencing in the past few days, include opening the shops trade-wise, reducing the timing of business hours, keeping hand sanitiser machines at all shops, creating a boundary with a rope to separate shoppers from shopkeepers, encouraging customers to pre-order goods on WhatsApp, and minimise cash transactions.“While all these measures look good on paper, it is next to impossible to implement them in a market like Sadar Bazar. The traders are fearful of Covid-19 because a majority of them are in their late 50s and 60s, running the business with the help of their employees, their children having refused to join, what with the poor working conditions in the market,” says Yadav.Making a choice is tough, says Rajender Sharma, a soft-toy trader in the market. “We are caught between the devil and the deep sea. The market is usually so crowded it is impossible for people to walk without literally falling over each other. You cannot maintain social distancing in the market where many streets are barely 3-ft wide,” says Sharma.Pawan Kumar, national organising general secretary, Bhartiya Udyog Vyapar Mandal, says that the odd-even formula proposed by the Delhi government would not work in Sadar Bazar.“There are hundreds of buildings here with one number, but as many as 20 shops, a result of the fact the property has over the years been divided among family members,” says Kumar who has his shop near Bara Tooti Chowk, in Sadar Bazar, one of the city’s oldest labour chowks, where manual labourers, masons, porters and house painters used to gather every morning looking for work. These days it wears a deserted look. “We kept meeting authorities over the past two decades to decongest the market, improve the infrastructure and working conditions, but no one cared. Now we are faced with an existential crisis,” adds Kumar.Pawan Khandelwal, a jeweller in Sadar Bazar says the market is the lifeline for lakhs of traders across north India. “Every house in Delhi would have something that came from this market. Here one can buy anything from cosmetics to toys, steel utensils, stationery, gas ovens, jewellery. You name it and we sell it, ” says Khandelwal.He is not exaggerating.Sadar Bazar, which is presently a containment zone, has dozens of submarkets such as Pratap Market, Swadeshi Market, Toys Market, Bartan Market, each dealing in a particular product. In all, there are about 83 traders associations in the market, more than in any other market in the city.Until the late 1980s, most traders lived in Sadar Bazar, with their shops on the ground floor and residence upstairs in localities such as Deputy Gunj, Prakash Gali, Matawali Gali, but as congestion increased over the years, most shifted out, converting their houses into warehouses and shops. They allowed, rather encouraged, the labourers to sleep in the house-turned-godowns, ensuring that they did not have to worry about lack of labour or break-ins, while workers and labourers got a place to live. Thousands of workers and labourers, who are mostly into loading , unloading and transporting goods on hand-pulled carts, who could not find a space simply slept outside shops and godowns, cooking, bathing sleeping in the narrow streets.For them, Sadar Bazar has been a home and a workplace for decades. For instance, Rajendra Prasad, 62. He was 20 when he arrived in Delhi 40 years ago on a pleasant March morning. From the railway station, he headed straight to Sadar Bazar, where he found work within a couple of hours. He earned ₹10 on day one and slept on a footpath in the night . “I remember a shopkeeper had asked me to load sacks of wool in a truck. I never went out of work in the market until this March, when it closed,” says Prasad. “I have been desperately waiting for the market to reopen for two months now; I think it is time to head to my village,” adds Prasad, who hails from Basti district in Uttar Pradesh.While thousands of labourers like Prasad left for their homes over the past two months, having failed to earn, there are others who have stayed putMallu Singh 40, who has so far resisted the temptation to leave, says: “ I was never short of work since I came to Sadar Bazar 22 years ago. Starting at 10 am, I would work late into the night , earning anything between ₹400 to ₹800 a day. “ I have waited for 2 months and I think I should wait for some more time before I leave,” says Singh , who hails from Gonda district in UP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/sadar-bazar-ponders-its-place-in-covid-era/story-a7t1n8W5fcPBbEagfQDGoI.html

22-05-2020||City||Arhtiyas demand entry of at least 700 customers to main sabzi mandi||While the administration and the market committee are struggling to manage the rush at the main wholesale vegetable market (sabzi mandi) of the city near Jalandhar Bypass, the Ludhiana Sabzi Mandi Arhtiya Association has sought passes for at least 700 customers to enter the market as, they said, they were suffering losses.The arhtiyas are also demanding that the mandi be allowed to operate for six days a week.Arhtiyas handed over a list of likely customers to the mandi to district mandi officer (DMO) Jaswinder Dhaliwal on Thursday. The DMO is a member of the three-member committee, formed by deputy commissioner (DC) Pradeep Kumar Agrawal, to look into the demands of arhtiyas and plan accordingly.Besides Dhaliwal, the other members of the committee include sub-divisional magistrate (SDM-west) Amrinder Singh Malhi and additional deputy commissioner of police-1 (ADCP) Gurpreet Singh Sikand.Following complaints of a huge gathering at the sabzi mandi, the administration had, on April 3, restricted the sale of vegetables and fruits in the mandi to three days Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday and only the listed suppliers, who sell vegetables to street vendors in the city’s 95 wards, were issued passes to enter the market.Ruing losses due to decline in sales, the arhtiyas have demanded that the mandi be opened for six days a week. They also demanded that the customers, other than vendors, should also be allowed to enter the mandi.President of the a association Gurkamal Singh said, “Arhtiyas have been facing losses as their regular customers are not allowed to enter the market. The vendors, listed with the market committee, make purchases from select arhtiyas only, as they illegally buy vegetables from other markets situated outside the city,” he said. “Arhtiyas also face losses as perishable items rot after a day. We are ready to take all required precautions, but the administration should open the mandi for six days a week,” added Singh.Dhaliwal said, “Arhtiyas have handed over the list of their regular customers, but a decision on whether to allow their customers or not, will be taken at a meeting of the committee expected to take place on Friday.”The then DMO Jasbir Kaur had tested positive in April and it is suspected that virus victim ACP Anil Kohli had also contracted the virus while he was deputed at the mandi.

22-05-2020||Chandigarh||12% school students have left Chandigarh amid migrant exodus triggered by Covid-19||Almost 12% of the total students enrolled in government schools of Chandigarh have returned to their native states along with their families during the period of lockdown.This came to light after around 9,000 students failed to turn up to get their textbooks for the new academic session, which were distributed for classes 1 to 8 by the education department .Only 64,033 students out of 73,075 have received the books. Most of the students who failed to turn up are children of migrant labourers who have gone back with their families, say the teachers responsible for distribution.It is estimated that the figure of 12% could still be higher considering that the present data has only been collected for classes 1 to 8. Around 25,000 students are enrolled in primary and senior secondary classes do not find a mention in the data because they were not a part of the distribution drive.The textbooks were distributed in a total 114 schools barring the government high schools of sectors 52, 56, and all the schools under cluster no 5—Government Model Senior Secondary School, Sector 26—as they fall under the containment zone.A teacher teaching at GMSSS Dhanas on the condition of anonymity said, “Most of the students who study here belong to Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Uttarakhand. Many are children of migrant labourers who have gone back now.” A senior UT education department employee said, “Whether the children will come back or not depends on how the formal schooling resumes after the lockdown. The Government of India is also silent on the mass migration of students along with their families. It’s not clear if in the middle of the session these students will be given admission in these schools again or if they will have to get re-enrolled in their respective states.”Commenting on the issue, Rubinderjit Singh Brar, director school education, also attributed the absence of students to reverse migration. He said, “Migration could be a plausible reason (for students not turning up).” When asked about the department’s future course of action, Brar said it will be worked out at an appropriate stage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/12-school-students-have-left-chandigarh-amid-migrant-exodus-triggered-by-covid-19/story-8ELhXPzFhP4zvAgZz67dDL.html

When his phone rang repeatedly, Patil ignored the calls since to take a call, he has to take off some of the PPE and so risk infection from the swabs.At the time, he had no idea that the calls were from his relatives in the village of Bhopivali, who were trying to reach him because his father Amrut, 68, had suffered a heart attack and urgently needed medical attention.When Patil took a break three hours later, he found more than 50 missed calls on his phone and learnt that his father was seriously ill. Patil immediately informed Dr Pradeep Jadhav, superintendent at RH, and just as he was leaving RH, he learnt his father had passed away.“I, as the eldest son of the family, was unable to save my father, when it was expected from me, but I was also busy testing samples at the laboratory,” said Patil, who performed his father’s last rites on Tuesday evening. He doesn’t regret the choice that he inadvertently made. “I had a duty to perform,” he said.Superintendent Dr Jadhav said Patil was an inspiration. “If Patil wanted, he could have gone to attend to his father and the administration would have helped him reach the village and provided other facilities. But Patil chose not to pick up the phone and continued to work in the laboratory,” he said, adding that Patil had called right after his father’s funeral and offered to return to work. “I told him not to and that the administration will call him if his presence is needed urgently. We are sad he was not able to help his family in their time of urgency, but he is an inspiration to all medical professionals of the nation. We are proud of him,” said Dr Jadhav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lab-staff-continues-covid-work-near-mumbai-loses-father/story-I4CB1GoEcGQx9A90GHj5nO.html

At least 12 people, belonging to Ambala, who turned up early to the bus stand to board buses back home, were turned back by the staff saying that the interstate bus service has still not resumed in Punjab.Rajeev Jhangra, 32, from Ambala, who had come here to attend his friend’s wedding, was among several others, who reached the bus stand in the hope of going back home. “I had read in the news that the Haryana government is working on resuming inter-state bus service, but the reality was otherwise. I request the state governments to start inter-state bus service too. People, stranded in different locations, have already exhausted their money and don’t have enough to hire private taxis,” said Rajeev. Nirmal Devi, 20, of Shekhampura village in Karnal district, who had gone to Delhi to find some work in February, and got stranded there, came here by a train. She was dropped by a police vehicle at the bus stand from the railway station around 7:30am. She said in the absence of inter-state bus service, she is left with no option but to hire a taxi. “After the lockdown was declared in March, I was stuck at my friend’s place for two months. I was eager to go back home, so I asked my friend’s brother to book any train available to Ludhiana from where I will take a bus to Ambala and further to my village,” said Nirmal Devi. Nirmal, who reached Ludhiana via Jammu Tawi Express at 1:30am on Thursday, was made to stay back at the railway station premises by police officials. “After reaching here, I came to know that there are no buses to Ambala at this time. I’m only left with Rs 750 while a private cab is costing between Rs 1,000 to Rs 1,500. I have asked my elder brother to send me some money so that I can afford a drive to home,” she said. As many as 53 buses ferried around 850 passengers on Thursday. Kuljit Singh Sodhi, station superviser, said 53 buses, both of PRTC and Punjab Roadways, ferried 850 passengers to different destinations including Jalandhar, Amritsar, Moga, Ferozepur, Patiala, Hoshiarpur, Chandigarh, Barnala, Bathinda, Muktsar and Mohali on Thursday.

A 300-bed facility has also been set up at MP Mills in Tardeo, even as Deora has been planning to set-up another centre at Parel. All of these centres will cater to semi-critical, asymptomatic patients.While the beds in these centres have been set-up by Ahmedabad’s Anant National University, the Godrej Group has been providing the medical equipment at the centres. The beds at the centres are made out of cardboard and have been laminated, making it easier for sanitisation. On Wednesday, Deora also tweeted that the quarantine centres are monsoon-proof and are “exclusively for the residents of Mumbai’s congested slums and chawls, who cannot self-isolate”.“There is a huge problem of social distancing in the congested areas of the city. So we need to create a many centres for asymptomatic patients,” Deora said. The former Lok Sabha Member of Parliament (MP) also stated that as Mumbai’s situation is grim, owing to the increasing number of cases every day, the city needs to isolate itself from the country. “We can’t get into why it [rise in cases] happened, but now that it is a reality, Mumbai needs to self-isolate from the rest of the country,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/former-mp-milind-deora-sets-up-quarantine-centres-for-covid-19-patients-in-south-mumbai/story-4iFUUetNIU4PH6FoRGENVP.html
22-05-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra government puts price cap on private hospitals for Covid treatment||The state health department has decided on a price cap for the treatment of Covid-19 at private medical facilities following reports of patients being charged exorbitant fees at private hospitals. Restrictions will also be imposed on the billing of medicines at these facilities. The government resolution (GR) with the new guidelines was passed on Thursday night. Earlier in the day, the health department fixed caps on how much private medical establishments may charge when treating Covid-19 patients. Once the GR is passed, private hospitals will be able to charge up to ₹4,000 per day for a general bed; ₹7,500 per day in the intensive care unit (ICU); and ₹9,000 per day if a patient is on a ventilator. The charges will also include meals.All private hospitals are liable to follow the rules laid down by the state government during a pandemic according to the Epidemic Diseases Act. Dr Sudhakar Shinde, chief executive officer of Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Arogya Yojana, said, “This [amount] will include the treatment fees, consultancy fees of doctors along with other expenses. Private hospitals can’t charge more than the fixed amount.”“Some patients may need moderately-costly medicines but the hospitals can’t charge more than 10% extra for such drugs,” he added, addressing reports of private hospitals charging between 40% and 50% more than the cost price for certain prescribed drugs. “High- end drugs like immunoglobulin, Meropenem, Parenteral nutrition, tocilizumab etc can be charged at MRP,” the GR said.According to the health department, it faced severe opposition from private hospitals when arriving at these new guidelines. “In March, when private hospitals were allowed to provide treatment to Covid-19 patients, the health department only imposed a price cap of ₹4,000 on general beds. But we didn’t provide bifurcation of other medical requirements which led to the exploitation of patients which we had to amend,” said an officer privy to the developments. Chief executive officer of Lilavati Hospital Dr V Ravishankar said that the hospital would abide by orders issued by the government.Politician Rais Sheikh, who has been vocal in his criticism of private hospitals overcharging patients, said, “At a time when the government is planning to take over 80% of the beds from private hospitals, they had to decide on the rates of the beds so that the hospitals don’t exploit patients further.”Health advocates have welcomed the state health department’s decision. “Non-Covid footfalls of patients in hospitals have decreased by 90%, so only Covid-positive patients are their source of income. So, they started extracting their income from these patients which is unethical. Most of the senior citizens don’t even have medical insurance,” said Dr Manohar Kamath, general secretary of Consumer Guidance Society of India (CGSI). Many Covid-19 patients are referred to private hospitals due to unavailability of beds in the government and civic-run hospitals. HT has previously reported how a relative of a Covid-positive patient had to pay ₹16 lakh for a 15-day stay in a private hospital and how some families had to take out loans to pay private hospitals bills. On May 4, HT had reported how private hospitals like Nanavati Hospital charged ₹8,000 to ₹9,800 per personal protective equipment (PPE) even though the cost of PPE ranges between ₹350 and ₹1,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-government-puts-price-cap-on-private-hospitals-for-covid-treatment/story-QCHQWv0TpOIAPAMGvQmDDN.html

In the memorandum submitted to the minister, the association has also sought the state government’s intervention in providing relief to the sector, including reduction in the rate of Goods and Services Tax from 18% to 5%, rent waiver, availability of loans at lower rates and relief in property tax. Earlier, the association had submitted a memorandum with cabinet minister and Ludhiana (West) MLA Bharat Bhushan Ashu. North India chairman of Indian Body Building Federation, Ramesh Bangar, said, “Fitness sector across the state has been hit badly due to the lockdown, but the government has failed to pay heed to the problem. Athletes, trainers, administrative staff, maintenance staff, gymnasium owners, and manufacturers of supplements and wellness equipment have been affected as the gymnasiums are closed. If this continues, it will also result in unemployment.”Punjabi Amateur Body Building Association general secretary Navneet Singh said the athletes generally work as trainers in gyms that are the basic source of their income. “The gymnasium owners are also burdened with electricity bills and the rent of their premises even during the lockdown period. If the gyms are opened, the owners will take full precautions as per the guidelines issued by the government,” he said. Congress leader Kulwant Singh Sidhu said the minister has directed the officials to put up the gym owners’ demands in front of the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/coronavirus-lockdown-owners-demand-reopening-of-gyms-in-punjab/story-8k9rVY855wwxW3AkzUgvdM.html

On May 19, he submitted a letter to Chembur Jain Bhavan seeking approval for the same.In the letter, he agreed to pay a minimal fee for the stay and also agreed to take responsibility for the cleanliness of the Bhavan. But soon, rumours started spreading and an angry local mob tried to enter his house forcefully on Wednesday and even threatened him.“These frontliners who are involved in the treatment of Covid patients can’t go home, so we need to make an alternative set up for them. The Jain Bhavan has 35 rooms which could easily accommodate around 70 of my hospital staff. So, I approached them on humanitarian grounds,” said Dr Prince D Surana.Following the incident, he has filed a written police complaint with Chembur police station. When HT contacted Rajesh Shah, a member of the trust, he refused to make any comment. “I don’t want to comment on the issue.”Medical staffers are most vulnerable to contracting the infection on duty so it is always advised to provide them alternative stay so that they don’t infect their families.

22-05-2020||Mumbai||State needs 250 more trains to take remaining migrants back home||After 441 special Shramik trains took 5.81 lakh migrant workers to their home states, the state government needs additional 250 trains to ferry the remaining migrants. The government will spend Rs 67 crore on running these special trains, of which Rs 54.76 crore have been released from the state exchequer.Over 61, 000 migrants in 51 trains returned to their respective states in the last 24 hours till Thursday evening. About 170 trains departed from Mumbai stations, including CST, Bandra, Lokmanya Tilak Terminus and Borivli. According to government estimates, another 2 lakh plus migrants have registered to return to their hometowns. “Highest number of the trains, around 225, was sent to Uttar Pradesh, followed by Bihar and Madhya Pradesh. We have a list of migrants who wish to go to North Indian states and West Bengal. We will need at least 250 more trains to depart over the next week. We have been getting more requests besides the ones registered after the lockdown,” said an official from the relief and rehabilitation department.Home minister Anil Deshmukh, in his statement on Wednesday, said that the state government has been bearing the cost of the fare. The state had transferred Rs 12.44 crore to various district collectors to pay the Railways for the tickets. The government had earlier released Rs 54.76 crore for the purpose.Ruling parties in Maharashtra and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders have been engaged in a spat over bearing the cost of the ticket fares. BJP leaders claimed that 85% of the cost is being borne by the Centre, while the Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leaders said that the entire cost was paid by the Maharashtra government. BJP state spokesperson Madhav Bhandari said that the Centre was charging only 15% of the cost of running special trains for the migrants. “Special trains are run without any subsidy during normal times and are also running at lesser occupancy. Hence the cost of running these trains is more and what is being charged to the state is 15% of the cost,” he said.Meanwhile, over 20,000 buses have been used to ferry more than 3 lakh migrants to the railway stations and borders of neighbouring states.Around 3.25 lakh migrant workers, stranded people and homeless, are staying in 3,500 shelter camps set up across the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/state-needs-250-more-trains-to-take-remaining-migrants-back-home/story-p91bySwbSa5we4A9SiTwmJ.html

In May (past 21 days) alone, the state has reported as many as 31,310 cases, whereas the total number of cases registered in April was 10,201.Till April-end, the number of new cases were in the range of 500, after which it turned into four digits since May 6.The fresh infections since May 6 are as follows: May 6 - 1,233; May 7 - 1,216, May 8 - 1,089; May 9 -1,165; May 10 - 1,278 cases, May 11 – 1,230; May 12 – 1,026; May 13 – 1,495; May 14 – 1,602, May 15 – 1,576 and May 16 – 1,606. Besides, on May 10, the state also declared 665 cases additionally, saying that they were registered in the few days prior to that and are being declared as per the Central government’s directive to bring the data at par with the national figures on the ICMR website.The first case of coronavirus was reported on March 9 and it took 30 days for the state to cross the 1,000 mark. For the first 10,000 cases, it took 53 days.Dr Tatyarao Lahane, director, Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER), said the state has not reached the community transmission stage — where the source of infection is unknown —as there is no exponential growth in the number of fresh cases. Also, state health authorities are expecting a flattening of the curve by this month end. “We are waiting for another 14-day incubation cycle to end on May 31, after which the rise is likely to come under control and gradually, the decline will start,” he said. He, however, also said if it doesn’t happen, then the rise may also lead to a community transmission stage.The number of recoveries has also jumped to 11,726 as 1,408 patients recovered on Thursday.The mortality rate of the state has come down to 3.54% (1390 deaths) on Wednesday, from 7.41% (148 cases) on April 13. However, it continued to be higher than the national mortality rate of 3.06% (3,435 deaths) till Wednesday, stated the data of the state medical education department.Last week, state health minister Rajesh Tope said the peak has not come yet and it may come by June-end. “All the predictions about the rise in cases in Mumbai and Maharashtra have not come true, but the numbers are rising and the peak is yet to come. Going by the mathematical predictions, the actual peak is likely to come by June-end. It means by June-end, the number of cases in Mumbai will increase four times. We are trying to prevent it from happening, but we have to be prepared for the worst and hope for the best,” Tope had said.So far, 26,865 people have been kept in institutional quarantine in the state and over 4,37,304 people have been put under home quarantine. On Thursday, the state also completed 59 days of lockdown that was imposed from midnight of March 23, a day before the nationwide lockdown imposed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It was partially lifted on April 20 in the areas where there are no cases or minimal cases. The state government, by its notification issued on Tuesday (May 19), allowed more industrial and commercial activities in rural and semi-urban areas by excluding them from red zones. The relaxations, however, will come into force from Friday. By restructuring red zones, it has also reduced the area under curbs of the lockdown to just 18 municipal corporations, having a population of 2.91 crore. Earlier, 14 districts with a population of 6.56 crore were under the red zones. “Allowing more activities in more districts will help not only in ensuring revenue generation, but also in sending a positive message to people who are under distress due to the pandemic,” said a senior minister.On Monday, the health department also declared to have conducted 3,19,710 tests at various public and private facilities across Maharashtra. Of them, 2,78,068 people tested negative. State currently has 1,949 active containment zones. A total of 15,894 survey teams, comprising doctors and assisting staff, have screened more than 64.89 lakh people.Of the state’s 36 districts, Gadchiroli was the only one that was not having a single case till May 18. However, some migrant workers, who returned to the district from Mumbai, tested positive and now it has seven cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/with-2-345-more-cases-maha-breaches-40k-mark-toll-1-454/story-UaQMSUS8PAw1ighU2rM0cK.html
22-05-2020||Mumbai||State assures fresh loans for 11.12 lakh farmers who didn’t get waiver||Although the state government has coined 2020 as the ‘productivity year’ by setting a higher target for agriculture production to give a helping hand to the economy, 11.12 lakh farmers are yet to get the benefit of the loan waiver announced by the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government. The state has directed district banks to offer them fresh credit. However, these farmers are not eligible for fresh loans for the ensuing kharif season in June, as they already have outstanding loans and banks need directives from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to release the amount. During the marathon review meeting on Thursday, this issue was prominently discussed. Besides chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray and his deputy Ajit Pawar, many senior ministers including agriculture minister Dada Bhuse, health minister Rajesh Tope and home minister Anil Deshmukh attended the meeting through video conferencing. Pawar, while admitting that the state government could not release Rs 8,100 crore towards the loan waiver to the remaining 11.12 lakh eligible farmers, assured them fresh loans. “We have deposited Rs 12,000 crore in the loan accounts of 19 lakh farmers under the loan waiver scheme,” he said.The cooperation department has directed the district banks to consider the farmers whose loan has not yet been waived off as eligible for the fresh loan. The state government has already requested the Centre for directives from RBI to give loans to such farmers. The government has set the target of crop loan of Rs 44,000 crore by commercial and district banks.CM Thackeray said that the farmers in the state can play an important role in bringing the economy out of the crisis in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. “The farmers should try to change the crop pattern amid the pandemic. Maharashtra farmers have the capacity of producing food grains that can feed the entire country. They should put in efforts in exporting their produce,” he said.Agriculture minister Dada Bhuse said that amidst the lockdown, the state government has made seeds and fertilizers available to the farmers. “We have supplied 60,000 metric tonnes of fertilizers and 20,000 quintals of seeds to 1.5 lakh farmers so far. The department has conducted workshops for 6 lakh farmers and trained them about various aspects of farming, including crops patterns,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/state-assures-fresh-loans-for-11-12-lakh-farmers-who-didn-t-get-waiver/story-dhQC6b9dvjQEHNVRqSOKqM.html
22-05-2020||Mumbai||No clean toilets for motorists as hotels shut||Motorists travelling with special permissions during the lockdown have reported a major issue for road travel: Shortage of clean restrooms and amenities due to hotels along the highway being shut during lockdown.Usually, national highways are dotted with brightly-lit restaurants and hotels, but the lockdown has meant they are not operational. Now, without these establishments, the highways look deserted and travellers finding it difficult to do long drives, as there is no food available and there are very few clean restrooms.“I was stuck at a relative’s house for two months in Mumbai and finally managed to get the travel permit last week. It took us almost seven hours to reach Vadodara from Mumbai and on the entire route, we only managed to find a restroom once,” said 65-year-old Bhavna Vashi, a resident of Vadodara. Vashi made the journey home in a private vehicle last week. “While the drive was quicker than usual because there were fewer vehicles on the highway, the worry was that we could not find a single restaurant open and the only restroom we found was close to a police check point, almost four hours into the drive,” she said.While Gujarat is still open to travel passes, some states, like Karnataka, have strict border entry rules in place which have pushed more highway hotels to remain shut as almost no vehicles are plying these routes.For 55-year-old Sanjay Mehta, this proved to be problem when he drove to the Karnataka border last weekend to pick up his two children, who are students at a university in Bengaluru and have been stuck in their hostel for the past two months.“Since Karnataka is not allowing vehicles, especially from Maharashtra, to enter, I first had to arrange for a vehicle to drop my children from their hostel to the Karnataka border [Belgaum]. My wife and I drove almost 500 kilometres and barely managed to find usable restrooms all the way,” said Mehta. With no hotels open, Mehta and his wife drove for six hours straight before parking their car on a petrol pump’s premises and resting for a few hours.Last week, state home minister Anil Deshmukh said Maharashtra Police had issued over 3.5 lakh e-travel passes for those involved in essential and emergency services as well as those who need to travel to other states due to an emergency.Vasant Pandharkar, from National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), Kolhapur district, said that with the number migrants walking on the roads declining sharply, the authorities and highway police are no longer arranging amenities along highways. “The number of migrants moving towards Karnataka through Maharashtra was huge between last week of March and end of April. That’s when we provided food water as well as sanitation facilities close to all our check posts at toll nakas. Since this population has declined and almost vanished in the last few weeks, we haven’t made arrangements for the same,” said Pandharkar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/no-clean-toilets-for-motorists-as-hotels-shut/story-JJHH95uWF1sI7opoD2y6kJ.html
22-05-2020||Chandigarh||Speaking to media ‘unhealthy practice’: PGIMER in gag order to doctors, staff||The Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research on Thursday issued a fresh gag order to its faculty members and staff amid the controversy over a community medicine expert’s report submitted to the Chandigarh administration.The report, which compared the outbreak in Mumbai’s Dharavi with that in Bapu Dham Colony in Chandigarh, had raised concern over handling of cases in the latter. A day after it was submitted, the PGIMER on Wednesday in an official release stated that no such survey has been carried. Now, PGIMER director Dr Jagat Ram has warned all faculty and other staff members that action will be taken against individuals under provisions of the Central Civil Services (Conduct Rules, 1964) for any breach. The order states that reports are appearing in newspapers wherein statements from faculty members are quoted, and that “such practice is unhealthy and undesirable”.Reiterating previous three orders issued in December 2005, May 2009 and January 2013, the order states: “It is stressed upon the faculty members and staff of the institute (that they shall desist from going to press and media without obtaining the prior permission from the competent authority.”In the recent past, the employees have been vocal about non-availability of personal protection equipment (PPE) in the hospital and the institute’s plan on managing the OPD rush, keeping in view the social distancing norms. A senior professor of the institute, wishing anonymity, said: “the faculty or staff only reaches out to media when the administration is not helpful. Such orders are against the founding principles of this institution.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/speaking-to-media-unhealthy-practice-pgimer-in-gag-order-to-doctors-staff/story-EmG2KVJPojDjIj9oe7uBxO.html

22-05-2020||City||India-Afghanistan trade via Wagah border likely to be resumed after Eid||The trade between India and Afghanistan through Attari-Wagah border, 28 km from Amritsar, is expected to be resumed after Eid-ul-Fitr holidays (from May 25 to 27) in Pakistan. “We have already got a letter from the Centre, instructing us to be prepared as the trade between the two countries will be started soon,” said a senior customs official, who didn’t wish to be named.The central government had suspended cross-border trade through the Attari integrated check-post (ICP), which facilitates India’s trade with Pakistan and Afghanistan, on March 13 as a precautionary measure amid the coronavirus pandemic. “We are expecting that the trade with Afghanistan will be resumed from May 28. We recently got information that two trucks of dried fruits, imported from Afghanistan, will come today at Wagah side in Pakistan. These trucks’ entry into India will be allowed only after we get official information from the Centre about the opening of the trade,” said a senior official of Land Port Authority of India (LPAI).Amritsar customs commissioner Dipak Kumar Gupta said, “Our team at the ICP is prepared. The trade can resume after Eid as there are holidays in Pakistan till May 27, and nobody is working at Wagah side. Till now, we have no official information when exactly the border is opening.”On May 17, the Pakistan government had opened its borders with Afghanistan at Torkham and Chaman posts, six days per week. The importers in Amritsar are also hopeful of resumption of trade with Afghanistan soon. “We are hopeful that the trade with Afghanistan will be resumed from May 28. Some Indian importers have already placed their orders with various firms in Afghanistan for dry fruit, herbs, jeera and mulethi,” said Federation of Karyana and Dry Fruit Association president Anil Mehra. He said since the halt in trade with Afghanistan through the ICP, the importers and exporters in India and Afghanistan have been suffering a huge loss. According to Mehra, India and Afghanistan had been doing more than Rs 1,000 crore trade every year through the ICP. “Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan should also think about the opening of trade with India through the ICP. It will boost the economy of both the countries,” said Mehra. In the wake of the Pulwama attack in February 2019, the Indian government had revoked the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status given to Pakistan and raised customs duty on every item being imported from Pakistan to 200%. Following this, import from Pakistan dipped drastically as Indian traders stopped buying goods, except low-priced commodities like rock salt.Also, Pakistani had shut trade with India after India abrogated Article 370 that granted special status to the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/india-afghanistan-trade-via-wagah-border-likely-to-be-resumed-after-eid/story-mvUoxm1kZydmeUS8HTwiWO.html

22-05-2020||Chandigarh||Gold in shrines a treasure of Sikhs: Sukhbir||Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Thursday said that gold and other sacred valuables belonging to the Sikh shrines “are a collective treasure of the Sikh community”.“There is no question of any individual or organisation even contemplating in the direction of donating even the smallest part of this treasure for any cause,” he said in a statement, referring to the controversy surrounding DSGMC chief Manjinder Singh Sirsa’s “inadvertent suggestion” with regard to a proposal for donations of gold by shrines of various religious communities as a help in the fight against Covid-19.Sukhbir said that strong Sikh sentiments are attached to treasures like these, some of which have immense historical and heritage value. “One must exercise extreme caution and a profound sense of responsibility while responding to any suggestion affecting even the tiniest part of that treasure,” he said.The SAD chief further said Sirsa’s statement was unacceptable and extremely avoidable, but it was good to see that he regretted it and apologised to the Sikh masses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gold-in-shrines-a-treasure-of-sikhs-sukhbir/story-w2b3boQjKBPQx2v6cMY88N.html
22-05-2020||City||After two months of lockdown, Mohali MC losses nearing ₹13 crore||A fund-starved Mohali municipal corporation has incurred losses to the tune of ₹13 crore in the last two months while the district was under a lockdown.What’s more, the civic body will not even get the goods and services tax (GST) share of ₹10 crore in lieu of octroi, which is a duty levied on various goods entering Mohali that the MC gets from the state government in the form of Punjab municipal fund.Even the unipole advertisers have refused to pay them the fee for two months amounting to ₹1.72 crore. They have, instead, written to the civic body asking for a waiver citing no revenue earned. Civic body has referred the case to the local bodies department for approval. There are around 102 unipoles affiliated with six companies in the city. Neither the ₹10 lakh rent nor the tehbazari fee (license to squat and sell goods in a particular location) that generally amounts to ₹5 lakh per month was collected by Mohali MC.NO DUTIES, CHALLANS COLLECTEDOther losses incurred include additional excise duty of ₹60 lakh; fee of around ₹7 lakh from road cuts, which is required to lay sewer and water pipes; challan fee of polythene, which is around ₹3 lakh; and building application fee, which comes to around ₹10 lakh for two months.On account of property tax, residents have just paid ₹10 lakh, which should have been ₹2 crore instead; water bill paid is only ₹5 lakh instead of ₹20 lakh.Every month, Mohali MC spends ₹5 crore on paying salaries, power bills, fuel charges, and maintaining cleanliness in the city. At present, the civic body is just left with savings of ₹22 crore to meet with various expenditures.MC commissioner Kamal Kishore Garg said, “It is a nationwide crisis and we have suffered a huge loss. We have asked the state government for funds to carry out some of our development works. There were no economical activities like collecting property tax, water bills, advertisement amount and others during the lockdown. Public dealing has begun, and we are hopeful of some recovery.” 200 TENDERS AWAIT ALLOTMENTMeanwhile, more than 200 tenders of development works worth ₹30 crore have not been allotted in the last six months. These projects pertain to development of parks, laying of paver blocks, footpath laying, re-carpeting of roads and installing outdoor gyms. In December last year, after failing to spend ₹9 crore allocated under various heads, the Mohali MC had re-appropriated the budget to shift the surplus funds to account heads with a deficit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/after-two-months-of-lockdown-mohali-mc-losses-nearing-13-crore/story-lI21qiZ8CuEId3DTeOQKuM.html
22-05-2020||Mumbai||Will Covid curve in Mumbai flatten in June?||On March 11, the city reported its first two cases of Covid-19. A little more than two months later, Mumbai accounts for 61.2% of the total cases in Maharashtra and has a mortality rate of 3.45% with 882 deaths, accounting for 60.6% of the state’s total deaths. Is this rise unprecedented? Has the lockdown helped and for how long should it continue?Since May 17, when Mumbai crossed 20,000 reported cases, its daily count of new cases started crossing 1,000. On May 17, the city reported 1,545 new cases, followed by 1,185 on May 18; 1,411 on May 19; and 1,372 on May 20. As of Thursday, Mumbai has recorded 25,500 Covid-positive cases.Officials attribute the spike to the city’s high population density, large slum population, more testing, and violating distancing guidelines. However, the authorities also said they had anticipated this trajectory at the beginning of the outbreak and expect the situation to come under control by mid-June.When will the curve flatten?It took 20 days for Mumbai to record 100 cases, between March 11 and March 31. Then, after 10 days, the city saw 1,000 cases on April 10. After 26 days, it crossed 10,000 cases on May 6. On May 17, the city had 20,000 reported cases.State surveillance officer Pradip Awate said, “This trajectory of cases was anticipated. We were already studying scenarios in other countries. When the first case came to Maharashtra on March 9, Italy, Spain, France, Iran were already seeing these trends. So we had expected this kind of rise. That’s why Maharashtra announced a lockdown before the Centre.”Municipal commissioner IS Chahal, who took charge of BMC on May 8, said last week that by the end of May, he expects 45,000 to 46,000 cases in Mumbai.Awate pointed to the example of China, which took approximately 72 days to flatten the curve after announcing its lockdown. Mumbai is likely to take eight to 10 days longer, given the population density of its slums.“We are already two months into the lockdown and there are 10 more days of May left. So the end of May would bring us to the 70-day mark. Let’s give Mumbai another 15 days, over and above the world average. So we are looking at mid-June for the curve to improve,” he said.Dr Om Shrivastav, who is part of the task force appointed by the Maharashtra government in April to tackle the state’s mortality rate, reiterated that the numbers in Mumbai follow an expected trend. “These are expected numbers, due to the pattern of the infection, trend in other countries, and for the population we have. When you test more, and adequately, you will find that the numbers increase. I don’t think we should be discouraged by a number. We should be looking at that percentage of the population who are going to require hospitalisation, intensive care, and ventilation. So long as we are able to provide services to those people, numbers in themselves mean nothing,” he said. Reasons for high number of casesMumbai’s high population density and many slum pockets are among the factors contributing to the spike in reported cases along with the number of tests conducted in the city.Awate said, “Mumbai’s biggest enemy is its density — 20,000 per sqkm, and it is much greater in slums. About 45% to 50% of the population resides in slums. Current cases are mainly coming from slums. Even when you have a lockdown, it is very difficult to religiously implement it in a slum where up to 10 people are residing in a room admeasuring 8x8 feet.”When Maharashtra reaches 199 cases per 1 lakh in the population, Mumbai’s slums, are expected to record 550 cases per 1 lakh, said Awate, adding that this proportion varies according to economic classes.Of the 24 wards in the city, those with the most number of Covid-19 cases also have one or more slum pockets or congested areas. For example, Dharavi is in G/North ward; Byculla and Nagpada are in E ward; Sewri and Wadala are in F/North ward; Worli Koliwada, Janata Nagar, Adarsh Nagar, and the chawls of Lower Parel are in G/South ward; Kurla is in L ward, and the slums of Govandi and Mankhurd are in M/East ward. In wards with a comparatively lower number of cases, such as T ward in Mulund and R/North ward in Borivli, cases are usually concentrated in slum pockets.While some citizens violating lockdown restrictions may be responsible for a small percentage of the rising numbers, Mumbai has also carried out rigorous testing, say authorities. For every million of the population, Mumbai has conducted about 11,784 tests and altogether, 1.53 lakh tests have been conducted so far. As of May 14, when Mumbai had conducted 1.27 lakh tests, it had surpassed test figures for Gujarat, Karnataka, West Bengal, and Delhi.Kiran Dighavkar, assistant commissioner of the G North ward, said, “People ask me why Dharavi cases are rising. Cases are a result of massive screening. We have screened as many as 4 lakh people and tested more than 3,500 people. Success shall be measured on early timely treatment, fewer deaths, and more discharges.” Has community transmission begun? Community transmission is formally announced by the government if two trends are noticed among positive patients: Persons testing positive despite the absence of relevant travel history and/ or contact with another positive patient, which means there is no way of tracing how the infection was contracted.A senior official from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) said there were some early signs of community transmission in the city. “Mumbai is getting cases in clusters, such as the Dharavi and Worli Koliwada phenomena. You cannot deny that these are early signs of community transmission,” said Awate. However, since such cases still account for less than 30% of the total number, the authorities are not saying community transmission has started.Another civic official pointed out, “Cases from fever clinics in containment zones account for less than 1% of the total cases.” As of Wednesday, BMC has found 683 of its total positive cases from fever clinics.Has the lockdown helped curb spread?Officials say the lockdown is achieving its purpose of pacing out the spurt in reported cases and giving hospitals time to ramp up facilities. It is also helping develop some amount of immunity in the population in a controlled manner, without burdening healthcare facilities. “As cases rise exponentially, if there is a boom in the first few days, the situation could go out of hand. We have managed to steer away from that scenario due to the lockdown,” said one civic official. Sanjeev Jaiswal, additional municipal commissioner, BMC, and in-charge of drawing up a post-lockdown plan for the city, said, “The city is slowly opening up. Proof of it is the increased traffic at checkpoints set up by Mumbai Police now in comparison to last month.” He pointed out that more shops, like grocery and hardware stores, were operational. “The city will have to start opening up in a staggered manner and a decision on this will be taken after consulting the state government,” said Jaiswal.However, for the immediate future, the lockdown remains in place. “It is not wise for Mumbai to open up so soon. We may be looking at lockdown remaining in Mumbai till the end of June, and red zones in Mumbai should not start for a few days even after that. Let the curve stabilise,” said an official.Jaiswal said BMC was prepared for another spike in cases when restrictions ease. “We are ramping up medical facilities,” he said. “It is important that healthcare is able to handle the spurt. Then we are okay.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/will-covid-curve-flatten-in-june/story-kyuMf780dPbkap75WemrCL.html
22-05-2020||Delhi||Cops must carry extra masks, sanitisers for arrested accused||All investigating officers of the Delhi Police must carry extra masks and hand sanitisers and give these to suspects before arresting them . The new rules issued by police commissioner SN Shrivastava also makes it mandatory to sanitise all anti-riot gear such as canes, batons and barricades before they are used for crowd control measures. The traffic have been told to insist on digital payments for traffic violation fines. Shrivastava said all personnel must follow these rules as the force is now back to focusing on crime prevention and detection duties.With the lockdown norms eased, markets have opened and traffic resumed in the national capital. A new set of rules and regulations have been set in place for the police personnel across the city to follow until the threat of the Covid-19 ceases to exist. Until last Monday, there were few relaxations and only citizens working with essential services were allowed on the roads. As a result, Delhi’s crime rate too had dipped. With fewer crimes reported at stations since the lockdown, police were also focusing on feeding the underprivileged, managing containment zones, conducting security checks on roads, and ensuring social distancing among citizens. Starting Thursday, all investigating officers were given extra pair of face masks and sanitisers. The sanitisers are a must along with the gun or the cane that police carry. Shrivastava wrote in a circular that the two must be given to every arrested person. The police chief also wrote to the 90,000 personnel that if a person is arrested for any bailable offence, the person should be granted bail immediately without prolonging their stay on the station premises.During a recent meeting of the top brass of the city police, it was decided that for crowd control police would use ropes along with barricades. “It is also mandatory for us to sanitise the anti-riot equipment such as lathis, shields and barricades. It is a drill that we have to follow before every protest now,” said a police officer, who wish not to be named. Over the last two months, since the nationwide lockdown, there have been very few protests in the city. There are around 9,000 to 13,000 protests held in Delhi each year. “Now that we are back to out regular work, we realise that a lot has changed. We have been told to use our own pens and not share them. There are separate and designated places at police stations for visitors. Visitors will also be provided masks if they don’t have one. All arrested persons in the station lock-up are being kept apart ensuring social distancing. Some of our field staff are directly going home and not coming to the station.

22-05-2020||City||First case of Covid-19 in Mandoli jail complex||The Mandoli jail complex registered its first case of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), with a prison officer testing positive on Wednesday. This comes around a week after an inmate of Rohini jail tested positive — the first case of the contagious infection in a Delhi prison. Seventeen more cases have emerged in Rohini jail since then.Since outsiders like family members and lawyers have for the past two months been banned from visiting the jail’s premises, officials in the prison department said they suspect the transmission inside the two complexes may be linked to infected prison officials who did not display symptoms of Covid-19. Delhi’s Tihar jail, which currently houses around 9,500 prisoners and is the most crowded prison complex in the country, had not reported a single case of Covid-19, as of Thursday night.Mandoli jail has around 3,100 inmates, while Rohini has 1,300.The Capital recorded 571 new cases of Covid-19 on Thursday, taking the total to 11,659, of whom 194 have died.In Mandoli, the infected deputy prison superintendent complained of fever on May 11, and went on leave. The prison’s director general, Sandeep Goel, confirmed the officer tested positive. “He was taking basic precautions like wearing masks and regularly using sanitisers. He was in contact with four people in the prison — two inmates and two staff members, who have been tested. All four are asymptomatic and have been sent to self-isolation,” he said. In the first positive case in Rohini jail, a 29-year-old inmate tested positive earlier this month after he was admitted to DDU Hospital for a surgery. The prisoner, who did not display any symptoms, had been admitted to the hospital for the surgery on May 10. After his results emerged, the Rohini jail administration tested other prisoners and jail officers whom he had been in contact with. Of these, 15 inmates and a jail officer tested positive for the disease. On Tuesday, an assistant superintendent of the Rohini prison also tested positive for the contagious disease.A senior government official, who has been part of the contact-tracing exercise said the virus may have made its way to Rohini jail through an asymptomatic prison officer. All inmates in the three jails — Tihar, Rohini and Mandoli — have no physical contact with outsiders except the prison staff. The biweekly visits of family members were cancelled in the third week of March to contain the spread of the disease. They are in touch with relatives through the jails’ landline facilities, and court hearings are also held through video conference. New prisoners are lodged separately in isolated cells for 14 days before being allowed to mingle with others. “None of the inmates who tested positive were new inmates. They were not in contact with anyone outside the prison for the last three or four months. The only way they may have been infected is through one of the jail officials. Jail officials cannot be blamed, because they showed no symptoms of the disease,” a senior Delhi home department official, who did not wish to be named, said. Goel said the prison department has made it compulsory for all staff to wear masks in the jails’ premises.“The jail staff must maintain social distance themselves, while also directing prisoners to follow the same. Any prison official who shows flu-like symptoms is being sent on leave. Many of our officers have relatives engaged in front-line work, and they have quarantined themselves at home. If a family member or relative display symptoms, prison officers get tested as well, and join work only if they test negative. We also have isolation centres for prison officers within the prison complex, but outside the jails. Tihar does not have a single case so far. We are taking all precautions to contain the disease.”The prison department has released around 3,000 prisoners on parole and interim bail to decongest the jails. Earlier this month, in Mumbai’s Arthur Road jail where 4,000 prisoners are lodged, 184 inmates and prison staff tested positive within a week of one prisoner contracting the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/first-case-of-covid-19-in-mandoli-jail-complex/story-HgTRitZ65DGvZMaSIkyQUP.html
22-05-2020||Delhi||Closures still in place, snarls now a norm on Delhi’s borders||Since Tuesday, when restrictions were eased to allow movement of people during the fourth phase of the nationwide lockdown, Delhi’s borders with Noida, Ghaziabad and Gurugram have become hot spots of chaos. Serpentine queues of vehicles, drivers honking constantly and the respective state police turning back people from Delhi have become recurrent scenes, with both Uttar Pradesh and Haryana refusing to unseal the borders that were sealed last month to prevent the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19). With the Covid-19 case count rapidly increasing in Delhi – it touched 11,659 on Thursday --- these states are insisting that allowing people from the national capital to enter would lead to a further spread of the virus. In effect, for those living in National Capital Region (NCR), lockdown 4.0 had brought no relief to their lives or movement.While the Delhi government has lifted the ban on passenger movement between Delhi and NCR, district administrations of Noida, Ghaziabad, Gurugram, Sonepat and Faridabad are allowing only those with a valid interstate pass and essential service providers to pass through. Lack of clarity in rules adopted by the state governments has led to confusion and chaos at the borders. Senior Delhi traffic police officers said over the past two days, severe snarls have been reported at the border areas. On Thursday, long jams were seen on the Delhi-Noida-Direct (DND) Flyway. Long tailbacks were also seen near Gurugram, Ghaziabad and Faridabad borders.Near the Ghazipur border, too, vehicles began lining up from 5pm, trying to cross from the capital to Noida. S Aravindh, a banker who works in Delhi and lives in Noida Extension, said while he has a pass issued for “emergency services”, there is a long wait at the borders.“The drive in the morning is still less cumbersome but by evening, on my way back to home (Noida), they (police) stop every car and argue with its occupants. They allow some and turn away the others,” Aravindh said.Close to 1,000 people were turned back by the UP Police at the three entry points to Noida—UP Link road, DND Flyway and Kalindi Kunj—on Wednesday, according to Noida additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP) Kumar Ranvijay Singh.On Thursday, Noida authorities allowed the movement of advocates following a Delhi high court order directing them to do so. Officials in Noida said they have sought clarification from the Uttar Pradesh government regarding the entry of people from Delhi. Till then, the borders will remain sealed.“We are allowing people involved in essential services and those with valid passes to pass through. We don’t have directions to allow everyone to enter Noida so far. We allowed advocates to travel on Thursday after the Delhi high court’s directed us to do so. But we have asked them to get passes made. Nearly 1,000 people were stopped from entering Noida on Wednesday from Delhi,” ADCP Singh said.Delhi traffic police washed their hands off the confusion saying they are allowing people from NCR towns to enter Delhi without restrictions.“Since the Delhi government has allowed offices to function with a full workforce, we are not issuing any movement passes for intercity movement. However, there are restrictions at the borders because of which there are jams on the Delhi side. The governments of UP and Haryana will have to sort this out,” a senior traffic police officer said. On Thursday, jams were reported since 4pm from National Highway-1, connecting Delhi to towns such as Sonepat, Panipat and Karnal, and NH-8 going towards Gurugram.Swati Singh, a resident of southwest Delhi’s Dwarka, who works in Gurugram, said she was called to work from Monday, but asked her office to allow her to work from home. “There is so much confusion on crossing the border that it will be more productive to work from home. On Wednesday, I spent nearly an hour to cross over to Delhi,” Singh said.Gurugram police commissioner Muhammad Akil said there were issues only during peak hours. “The challenge is only in the morning as people try to sneak in before office hours. Our teams are vigilant and barricades have been set up. We are closely monitoring the situation and changes will be made only after the pandemic has been brought under control,” he said.Noida police are advising residents to check the status of restriction before entering Delhi without a movement pass.But with railways scaling up its operations and the Centre all set to start domestic flights from May 25, residents of NCR say there should be some coordination between the state governments.“Despite the relaxation in norms by the Centre, there is no coordination between various state governments in the NCR,” Rejimon CK, member of the Dwarka Forum, said.Urban transport experts say relaxing restrictions, especially related to transport, in Delhi has little meaning until it is implemented in the other NCR cities.“The influence area of a city (like Delhi) is much beyond the political or administrative boundaries. In the post-Covid scenario, there is a need to plan for Delhi Urban Agglomerate, which includes Noida, Gurugram, Ghaziabad, Faridabad etc. With Metro and other public transport between these cities yet to start, it is difficult to revive economic activity,” said Amit Bhatt, director transport, WRI India.Transport experts say as people will have to take precautionary measures like social distancing, there is a need to have a detailed transport plan for the NCR.“There are people who have to travel from Noida to Gurugram and are forced to take multiple passes from different authorities. There should be a single pass system for the NCR. This not only saves commuters’ time but also ensures smoother enforcement,” Sewa Ram, professor of transport planning at the School of Planning and Architecture, said. The Delhi government said it has requested the UP and Haryana governments to lift the ban on commuter movement. Jasmine Shah, vice-chairman of Dialogue and Development Commission of Delhi, said, “We have requested the UP and Haryana governments to allow interstate movement of people now that the Centre has relaxed norms. Cities in the NCR, especially with which we share our borders, are interdependent. The stand taken by the governments is unfortunate. We have to now try and restore normalcy.” KK Rao, Faridabad commissioner of police, said, “The situation was under control but after two people, including a doctor, who were frequently visiting Delhi, tested Covid-19 positive, only health workers and ambulances have been permitted to cross the border without movement passes.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/borders-become-hot-spots-of-chaos-as-states-refuse-entry-to-people-from-delhi/story-MgnIGLYktO8NiyMLsBWiqK.html
22-05-2020||City||Pandemic sets back Delhi govt’s bus procurement project by a year||The Delhi government’s project to strengthen the Capital’s public transport system by adding a new bus fleet has been adversely affected by the nationwide lockdown imposed to contain the spread of Covid-19 as the procurement and arrival of more than 2,800 buses is set to be delayed by almost a year due to revenue shortfall and limitations in manufacturing, according to senior government officials.The demand for more buses assumes more importance now as the 2,000 buses presently plying are allowed to carry only 20 passengers each due to social distancing norms against the usual capacity of 40. The average daily ridership of Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) before the lockdown was around 4 million. The Delhi government on July 11 last year announced its final procurement plan for 4,000 buses -- all of which should have arrived maximum by this month, according to the schedule shared by the authorities at that time. Ten months later, 1,150 buses including 1,000 non-AC standard-floor and 150 AC low-floor buses, are plying on Delhi’s roads.Transport minister Kailash Gahlot said the government’s procurement schedule of the 1,000 DTC buses, 1,000 electric buses and 1,000 low-floor CNG buses could now take one full year to be completed. He said in the best-case scenario, a first batch (100 or so) of the remaining 2,850 buses could arrive only by the end of this year. “The delay will not just be because of the financial constraints we are facing at the moment, but also because of problems faced by bus manufacturers owning to the lockdown. Thankfully, we at least received all of the 1,000 CNG standard-floor buses before the lockdown began on March 25,” Gahlot said.The government was to receive about 100 AC low-floor buses from JBM Auto Ltd. in April. But they could not arrive because the lockdown got extended. “Even though the restrictions have been relaxed , these buses, even if they arrive in Delhi, cannot be used because they are BS-IV vehicles and could not be registered by April 30, the deadline set by Supreme Court for the registration of BS-IV vehicles,” said one of the officials cited above. Bus manufacturer JBM Auto Limited said it is awaiting directions from the government with regard to the registration of BS-4 buses that was delayed due to the lockdown, so that their buses can be put to use.“The company re-opened its plant in Kosi only a week ago and that it is facing shortage of manpower. We are working only on one shift as there is very limited manpower. Many of our workers are in their home towns. Only maintenance work is being carried out as of now. A few people have been issued passes in our plant by the UP government to comply with the Covid-19 guidelines,” said Nishant Arya, Executive Director, JBM Group.Delhi has a fleet of 6,487 buses of which more than 2,000 are being used for public transport and around 1,400 are on Covid-19 duty. A reason for not being able to run the remaining buses is that the drivers and conductors who live in NCR cities such as Noida, Gurugram, Ghaziabad or Faridabad are facing issues in reaching the depots due to border restrictions by UP and HaryanaAccording to a second senior official cited above, the lockdown forced DTC to ask finance department to utilise funds (amounting to Rs 325.5 crore and meant to meant for procuring 1,000 AC low-floor buses) to pay salaries to its employees in the coming months if its financial situation does not improve. The main components of DTC’s operating cost are wages and salaries, accounting for around 60%, fuel (CNG), which accounts for nearly 20%, and annual maintenance (nearly 10%).With public transport shut for more than 50 days and schools closed, DTC is losing more than Rs 2 crore every day in revenue from bus journeys -- who us saying this. To foot the bills for salaries, pensions, statutory and other liabilities, DTC utilised Rs 512.50 crore, which the Delhi government disbursed to the corporation as grant-in-aid for the first quarter of 2020-21. According to the Delhi economic survey 2018-19, the working losses of DTC were Rs 1,750.37 crore. A fresh tender for 1,000 electric buses also could be floated not before July, a third official said.The officials said restrictions in the number of passengers in public transport will continue till things normalise. Delhi Metro, which carries around 2.7 million passengers daily, is also shut, putting extra load on DTC.Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director at the Centre for Science and Environment, said there could be some learnings from the challenge. “Social distancing rules have given an opportunity to explore ways of decongesting public transport for the future. Even when the Metro opens, it would not suffice because of the new rules. So, the government must use whatever resources are available. Hiring private buses immediately is need of the hour,” she said. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pandemic-sets-back-delhi-govt-s-bus-procurement-project-by-a-year/story-4IqlogCf11atda55JCmM8J.html
22-05-2020||Delhi||Parks across Delhi to reopen, with curbs aplenty||More than 14,000 parks in the Capital, including the ones in residential neighbourhoods, will be opened in the next two days -- but with certain riders and restricted timings to prevent the spread of Covid-19.The park can be accessed for three hours each in mornings and evenings -- between 7-10 am and 3:30-6:30pm. People above 65 years of age and children younger than 10 will not be allowed and those with chronic diseases have been advised to stay away. Masks will be compulsory and so will be other Covid-related health protocols such as social distancing. The open gym equipment, swings and group yoga or exercise sessions are prohibited.The municipalities, which do not have enough enforcement staff, expect people to voluntarily follow the rules.The three municipal corporations of Delhi -- south, north and east -- on Thursday took the decision to open parks after the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) brought out a similar order on Wednesday and opened Lodhi Garden, Nehru Park and Talkatora Garden.“We had been getting many requests to open these parks. People need fresh air and exercising is vital to maintain immunity. We got to know that a huge number of walkers thronged the Lal Bagh Botanical Garden in Bengaluru when it reopened on Tuesday. Hence, we decided to open our parks with some restrictions from Friday,” said Ashish Priyadarshi, director of horticulture department, north corporation.The north corporation has 6,095 parks spread over 2,200 acres, including Ajmal Khan Park in Karol Bagh. The East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) will open its 2,097 parks -- the largest and most popular of which are Jheel Park near the Welcome Metro Station, Mahila Park in Trilokpuri and Bahubali Enclave Park near Karkardooma Court -- from Saturday.“We cannot do a thermal scanning of people visitors nor can our limited number of security guards enforce social distancing. Users will have to do self-restriction for their own good,” said RK Singh, chief of horticulture in EDMC.The South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) will open its parks. But the popular ‘Waste to Wonder’ park near Sarai Kale Khan and ‘Nandan Van’ in Greater Kailash will remain shut. “The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), in its May 18 order, said entertainment parks should remain shut till May 31. So, we will keep these two closed for now. Our 6,000 colony parks will be open from Friday,” Alok Singh, horticulture chief, SDMC, said. The six functional biodiversity parks of Delhi -- Yamuna Biodiversity Park near Wazirabad, Aravalli Biodiversity Park near Vasant Kunj, Tilpath Valley near Haryana border, Tughlaqabad Biodiversity Park, Neela Hauz and Kamla Nehru Ridge -- will stay closed till May 31. “Ironically, Friday (May 22) is International Biodiversity Day, which we used to celebrate with a lot of fanfare holding lectures for students. We used to tell them that disrupting healthy ecosystems such as forests through tree felling leads to more contact between wildlife and humans, leading to zoonotic diseases. Covid-19 is one of them,” said Faiyaz Khudsar, scientist in-charge at the Yamuna Biodiversity Park.M Shah Hussain, scientist in-charge at Aravalli Biodiversity Park, said their parks are anyway serving the “ecological purpose for now.” “Our parks are providing oxygen and controlling the city’s temperature. When the government allows, we will open up for the public as well,” he said.Lodhi Garden got 350-400 walkers and joggers after nearly two months on Thursday. Nirbhaya Tiwari, an evening shift guard on its gate number 1, said they were required to brief visitors about the norms. “Everyone has to wear a mask and no one is allowed to sit in the garden. We are not allowing people above 60 years and children below 10 years. All toilets are being sanitised and arrangements of water and hand wash are made,” he said.Only four gates are allowed to remain open between 7 am and 10 am and 3:30 pm and 6:30 pm. “Only gate number 1, 3, 4 and 7 are open,” Tiwari said.Harpreet Kurwi, an architect from Safdarjung Enclave, arrived at Lodhi garden around 4:30 pm. Kurwi, a regular visitor till the lockdown was announced, said, “It’s very suffocating at home for regular walkers like us. When I got to know that the park is opening I got so excited. It feels refreshing,” he said.Another regular visitor, Paras Arora, who works in Gol Market, said he walked for 30 minutes on the first day after the lockdown. “The lockdown has made us very lazy. I could walk for only 30 minutes today. It’s a little difficult because of the mask,” he said.Priya Singh, a housemaker from Lodhi colony, said, “I had come twice in the last two weeks to check with the guard here if they are opening the park. It’s a big relief today,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/municipalities-to-open-parks-over-next-two-days-people-asked-to-follow-covid-health-protocols/story-KvxzzffJWRjrGX0KcwVP9L.html
22-05-2020||Delhi||Migrants again turned away from screening centre, govt to increase centres and trains||Raghu Nandan Pandit, a daily wage labourer, was among hundreds of migrant workers who were turned back by officials from a screening centre in Lajpat Nagar on Wednesday despite receiving a text message confirming his reservation for a Bihar-bound Shramik Special Train. “I vacated my room in Seelampur last night after receiving the confirmation message for the train. Only I know how I have spent the last two months. My landlord would give me one bucket of water for a day for washing, cleaning, cooking and everything else. Where do I go now?” he said. Hundreds of migrants on Thursday complained that they were turned back from the screening centre in Lajpat Nagar despite receiving confirmation messages for their reservation. HT had on Thursday reported a similar incident from two screening centres in east Delhi.As a solution to the problem, the Delhi government has now decided to increase the number of screening centres in the city. A government spokesperson said, “It’s come to our notice that a large number of people are turning up to the screening centres even without receiving messages. We have now decided to increase the number of these centres and also the number of trains in the next few days. It will help us screen more migrant workers per day.” Presently, there are 30 screening centres across the city.On being asked why the messages were sent to more migrants than the number of available seats, the official said, “We have not sent extra messages. They may have brought more people with them on the basis of one message.”However, stranded migrants outside the centre showed messages of reservation for trains to Patna, Bhagalpur, and Muzaffarpur that they had received the previous night. “Your journey has been scheduled for May 21. The train will stop at BKM and buses will be provided for other districts near these stations. Food and other arrangements have been made. You are requested to come for screening on May 21 at 8am with your family and luggage,” read one of these messages.Amarjeet Kagadia, 19, who used to work in a factory in Bawana, said that he had also vacated his room the previous night after receiving the message and left for the screening centre around 3am on Thursday. “I was left with ₹1,500, of which I paid ₹350 to the auto driver to take me to the centre. Now, the police are telling me to go back. Where do I go? I have never felt so helpless. Whey did they ask us to come here today if we were not supposed to go home?” he said.Around 4pm, a group of angry migrants was seen holding a meeting. Addressing them all, Raheem, who used to work at a bag printing unit in Nabi Karim, said, “We should find work in Bihar. We should demand our political leaders there to restart all mills so that we can get employment opportunities there. No one should have to come to work in Delhi.”The migrants decided not to leave and continue to stay outside the centre. “Why should we leave and where should we go? I’ve three daughters with me. How can I take them here and there? We don’t even have money to commute now,” Bhawari Devi, who was used to work in a toy factory in Bawana, said.When contacted, Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said that he was aware of the situation. “We are putting them up in various schools and will send them home by train on Friday,” he said.Around 7.30pm, the officials at the centre asked the stranded migrants to stay put; however, they were not allowed inside the school. “We have been asked to wait here and not leave. We just don’t have any choice now. It’s been a very tiring day. I can’t walk now,” Ranjeet, who wants to home to Bhagalpur to take care of his wife who is in her last trimester of pregnancy, said.Despite several attempts, south-east district magistrate Harleen Kaur did not respond to calls and messages sent by HT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/migrants-again-turned-away-from-screening-centre-govt-decides-to-increase-the-number-of-centres-and-trains/story-ke4OR4rNBalSmR6hkbjzkM.html
22-05-2020||City||Two tankers with 50,000 litres of illicit spirit seized in Mohali’s Zirakpur, four persons held||Four persons including two drivers were arrested for stealing extra neutral alcohol (ENA) from two tankers containing 50,000 litres in Zirakpur on the intervening night of May 20-21, police said.ENA is the primary raw material for making alcoholic beverages. Those arrested were identified as drivers Gurmeet Singh of Patiala and Amarjit Singh of Lalru, Kamal Deep Singh of Ambala and his accomplice Partap Singh Virk of Zirakpur. They were produced before the court on Thursday and sent to two-day police remand.Mohali deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan said, “The liquor smugglers who were escorting the tanker carrying illegal alcohol were nabbed. The owner of the premises who was moving in a black Fortuner SUV was also nabbed.”DC said Kamal and Virk, who were in the SUV, threatened the police team. “The accused were found to be offenders wanted by the police in various cases,” said the DC.As per the police, Gurmeet and Amarjit had brought 25,000 litre each from Rajpura and were on their way to Chandigarh. They were parked in Zirakpur and were transferring the spirit from the tanker to plastic drums when the team raided them.Police have registered a case under sections 420 (cheating), 379 (theft), 188 of the Indian Penal Code and under the Excise Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/two-tankers-with-50-000-litres-of-illicit-spirit-seized-in-mohali-s-zirakpur-four-persons-held/story-6Tb2Pbb33kYmwEZOZdYRXM.html
22-05-2020||Chandigarh||Central ACs should run 2 hrs before office opens: Haryana govt advisory||Sounding a word of caution on the use of central air-conditioning in institutions and malls in view of the prospects of Covid-19 spread, the Haryana government on Thursday said it is advisable to avoid central air-conditioning to the extent possible. Adopting new central guidelines prepared by central public works department (PWD), the state government said if running central air-conditioning becomes unavoidable, then air-handling units (AHUs) of central ACs should run on maximum fresh air two hours prior to the opening of office and two hours after the closing to ensure that no contamination remains. AHUs are the lungs of a heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system. It is a device used to regulate and circulate air as a part of HVAC system. It takes outside air, filters it, cool or heat it and supply it as fresh air to the air-conditioned area.The guidelines also said that AHUs are advised to be operated on maximum fresh air and heat recovery wheels should not be used at all. Experts said that thermal wheels allow transfer of heat between two adjacent airflows and help in saving energy. The air being expelled is used to cool the hot incoming air during summers using thermal wheels.The best cooling options without aiding infection or contamination are window-fitted desert coolers, window and split ACs, fans aided by maximum fresh air intake by opening doors and windows and supported by air replacement through exhaust fan facilities in nearby areas, stated the new guidelines. Maximum caution should be exercised to minimise the chances of spread of Covid-19 through airflow in enclosed spaces like residences, offices, meeting and assembly places, the guidelines added. Guiding principles for running air coolers and air conditionersTemperature settings of all air conditioning devices should be between 24-30 °CRelative humidity should be 40-70%Fresh air intake should be ensuredRe-circulation of air should be avoided Ensure adequate cross ventilationReplace air using exhaust fans Air sanitisation should be frequent done by regularly cleaning and sanitising filters of indoor unitsAvoid being in direct line of airflow Decontaminate surfaces frequently Observe social distancing normsA recent research report by Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangzhou, China discussing the Covid-19 outbreak associated with air conditioning in a restaurant concluded that in this outbreak, droplet transmission was prompted by air-conditioned ventilation. “The key factor for infection was the direction of the airflow. One patient was afebrile and 1% of the patients in this outbreak were asymptomatic, providing a potential source of outbreaks among the public. To prevent spread of coronavirus in restaurants, we recommend strengthening temperature-monitoring surveillance, increasing the distance between tables, and improving ventilation,” the report has suggested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/central-acs-should-run-2-hrs-before-office-opens-haryana-govt-advisory/story-8amo4KVcNkcnWSjAT5sS7J.html
22-05-2020||Latest||Sourav Ganguly’s post reminds fans of 2002 Natwest final||Sourav Ganguly’s years as captain of the Indian team had many great moments but the one that stands out for many is him waving his shirt over his head on the balcony of the Lord’s after Mohammad Kaif led India to a dramatic win over England in the final of the Natwest series in 2002.Fans on Twitter remembered that moment once again when Ganguly posted photos of him “fixing” a mango tree from his balcony in Kolkata after Cyclone Amphan. “The mango tree in the house had to be lifted, pulled back and fixed again .. strength at its highest,” Ganguly said in the tweet alongwith the photos. “Dada, another balcony another show of strength!” said a user“Dada and balcony a better love story than veer Zara,” said another tweet while a user said that the love story is better “than Titanic.” “Dada aur balcony ka purana rishtaa hai,” said another tweet.

All symptomatic patients with Influenza Like Illness (ILI) and patients who develop ILI symptoms should also be tested.Maharashtra state health commissioner Dr Archana Patil instructed all municipal corporations and district hospitals to follow the ICMR guidelines.Pune district collector Naval Kishore Ram said that the new guidelines will help streamline the testing process and reduce the pressure of testing labs. “We have received the new guidelines from the state health department. We have forwarded it to our district hospitals and health officials. From now onwards testing will be done only according to the given guidelines and it will certainly reduce the pressure on the testing labs,” he said.According to officials of the health department, it was found that swabs of persons travelling from one district to another were sent for testing. This increased the number of tests and put pressure on the labs. This unnecessary testing was delaying the reports of high-risk patients. So to streamline this process all the testing labs, district hospitals treating Covid patients are been given proper instructions for testing.As of May 20, 35,302 testing have been done in Pune city, out of which 3,899 persons have been tested positive. While 221 people have lost their lives due to Covid-19, 2,023 persons have been completely recovered and discharged from the hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/new-icmr-guidelines-will-reduce-the-pressure-on-the-testing-labs-ram/story-SB6MJsJ2qXMCKq8e1FoyOL.html

Baba Giram, a school bus operator from Padmawati, said, “I own four buses and have to pay equated monthly installments (EMIs) to banks as I took loans to purchase the vehicles. With no income, my EMI continues and I also pay half salary to drivers. So, it is really a tough time for survival.”Giram compared the financial condition of school bus owners with farmers who end up committing suicide. “We hear farmers committing suicide because of severe financial crunch. I fear many vehicle owners would meet a similar fate if the present crisis continues.”Many schools held online classes during March and April in view of the contagion. Some educational institutes like Deccan Education Society has decided to hold classes online for a few months in the next academic year.Rashid Inamdar, another school bus operator, said, “We have to pay driver salary, yearly vehicle insurance and EMI despite earning zero income. There is uncertainty about the future as experts say that social distancing norms will leave buses and autos with less occupants and less income.”Auto driver Tanaji Lavate said, “We don’t know when would schools reopen. When the classes begin, the government would not allow more kids on autos due to the Covid-19 pandemic. It will be difficult to survive as most operators have to pay vehicle loans.”Ajit Abhyankar, an economist, said, “The government must help this sector and provide loan subsidy. The interest on their loans should be paid by the government for the next six months.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/school-transport-operators-drivers-in-pune-see-a-difficult-road-ahead/story-eLIc0bTNhy3sG8bdV9YoKM.html

The students have written to the vice-chancellor demanding the university to follow the recommendation of the University Grants Commission (UGC) regarding the examination. In wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, the UGC had recommended that the university exams should be conducted for final semesters only, while the students in intermediate semesters should be graded based on an internal assessment of the present and previous semesters.“The varsity has failed to implement the UGC guidelines for conducting examinations so we have decided to boycott the online classes from Thursday onward,” said Syed Ahtisham Qadri, a spokesperson at Kashmir University Students Committee (KUSC).He said, “The university is yet to take a call on the examination schedule as we are already running behind the schedule. Even the postgraduate students of 2018-2019 batch had only appeared in their lone semester examinations to date.” The letter to the VC further stated, “The students are not demanding mass promotion but evaluation as per the UGC protocol that is based on the internal assessment and previous records only.”The students in the letter also demanded fee concession for this year due to the hardships faced by them due to the coronavirus enforced lockdown.“There will be no filling up of any online examination forms until the current situation is over. There are many students who can’t afford the telecom charges to hold the online classes,” the letter stated adding that ‘the varsity has been giving too many assignments to students hence putting extra burden on them”.

With the extended lockdown, the condition of the under-privileged is only worsening. While many good samaritans are coming forward to help the distressed, three Delhi-based girls have adopted a community in Kalindi Kunj.Under the project Panah, the young brigade, Aliza Ali (alumna of Shri Ram College of Commerce), Mallika Goel (alumna of Lady Shri Ram College for Women) and Noyonika Gupta (alumna of Indraprastha College for Women) joined forces to contribute as proactive citizens of the country. “The community in Kalindi Kunj mainly consists of daily wage and migrant labourers. Amidst them are struggling widows with a family to feed. Faced with an unwarranted situation like this, life for these women has become a constant ordeal, since they lack traditional means of support. The lockdown, as described by many of them, is an experience “as horrid as a nightmare”, since almost all of them have lost their means of livelihood. Project Panah worked towards gathering funds and supporting this local community, struggling to make its way through a global crisis,” says 22-year-old Ali.The girls have adopted 85 families and they carried out donation drive in two phases. Goel says, “Food packages consisting of rice, daal, salt and other essential food grains were distributed, thereby sustaining them for a period of 2 months.”For the group, this project was the first ever experience to work with the ground realities. Ali adds, “We strongly believe that helping others in such uncertain times is a responsibility, not a favour. We are now even more enthusiastic to continue our work for the society.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/meet-the-youngsters-who-adopted-families-of-widows-in-this-pandemic/story-kCO6Ulwrz8s8ToZ6wM40tI.html

22-05-2020||World||At least 57 dead as Pakistan plane crashes in residential area in Karachi||At least 57 people were killed when a Pakistan International Airlines plane with 99 people on board crashed into a densely populated residential area near the Jinnah International Airport here on Friday, officials said, nearly a week after the COVID-19-induced air travel restrictions were lifted by the government.Flight PK-8303 from Lahore was about to land in Karachi when it crashed at the Jinnah Garden area near Model Colony in Malir, minutes before its landing, they said. The PIA Airbus A320 carrying 91 passengers and eight crew members has crash- landed into the Jinnah Housing Society located near the airport, a spokesperson of the national carrier said.Thick black smoke rose from the accident scene of devastation in the Model Colony area.Earlier, a PIA spokesperson and many media reports said that there were 107 people on board the aircraft.Sindh Health Minister Azra Pechuho and rescue officials confirmed that 57 dead bodies have been recovered so far from the site of the crash. “But we are still to determine whether these 57 people were all on board the flight or include area residents as a number of houses have been badly damaged by the aircraft when it crashed,” she said. The minister said there are three survivors including President of the Bank of Punjab Zafar Masood. He called up his mother to inform her of his well-being.Faisal Edhi of the Edhi Welfare Trust said that around 25 to 30 residents whose houses were damaged by the plane have also been taken to the hospital, mostly with burn wounds.The aircraft wings during the crash landing hit the houses in the residential colony before crashing down.“At least 25 houses have been damaged in this incident,” Edhi said. “The first priority is to rescue the people. The main hurdle is narrow streets and presence of ordinary people who gathered at the place after the crash but they have been dispersed,” the minister said.According to a PIA official, the captain informed the air traffic control that he was having problems with the landing gear before the aircraft disappeared from the radar.Thick black smoke rose from a scene of devastation in the Model Colony area.Television footage showed rescue crews combing through debris strewn across the streets of the district - 3 km north-east of the airport - where a number of houses have been destroyed.The cause of the crash is yet to be confirmed. PIA chief executive Air Vice Marshal Arshad Malik said the pilot had told traffic control that the plane was experiencing “technical difficulties”.Malik rejected reports that the plane had problems even before flying. Talking to the media, he said the aircraft was completely safe and sound.He said all checks and procedures were done and “technically as well as administratively everything was in place and perfect”. The plane with 99 people on board came for landing but just before landing the pilot said he was going for a go-around. While coming for a second landing, it developed some problems and crashed. “The real cause of the mishap will be known after inquiry, which will be free and fair and it will be provided with media,” he said. He said some houses were damaged but none of them collapsed. There was no death on the ground so far. Malik said that the entire operation will take two to three days to complete. Pakistan’s Dunya News said it had obtained a recording of the conversation, also posted on monitoring website liveatc.net. In it, the pilot says they have “lost two engines”. Several seconds later he calls “Mayday, Mayday, Mayday” and there is no further communication. Meanwhile, President Arif Alvi expressed grief and sorrow over the loss of lives in the plane crash. Prime Minister Imran Khan, while expressing deep sorrow over the loss of precious lives as a result of the PIA passenger plane crash in Karachi, has ordered an immediate inquiry into the incident. Pakistan Army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa condoled the loss of lives and directed the military to provide full assistance to the civil administration in rescue and relief efforts. Prime Minister Narendra Modi condoled the loss of lives in the plane crash and wished a speedy recovery to those injured. The flight was coming from Lahore to Karachi after the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) allowed limited resumption of domestic flights last Saturday following weeks of lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic. Television channels showed several houses and cars damaged in the society where the aircraft crashed. The plane lost contact with the air traffic control at 2.37 PM (local time), PIA spokesman Abdullah Hafeez said. He said that the passengers included, 31 women and nine children. A resident of the colony who witnessed the crash told Ary News channel that the aircraft had fire coming from its wings which crashed into rooftops of some houses before it crash-landed. This is the first major aircraft crash in Pakistan after December 7, 2016 when a PIA ATR-42 aircraft from Chitral to Islamabad crashed midway. The crash claimed the lives of all 48 passengers and the crew. Friday’s accident occurred on a day when the interior ministry announced Eid holidays from May 22 to May 27, even as the country was facing a spike in the coronavirus cases. The COVID-19 cases in the country have crossed the 50,000-mark after a record 2,603 more patients were diagnosed on Thursday. The death toll stands at 1,067.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-least-57-dead-as-pakistan-plane-crashes-in-residential-area-in-karachi/story-naucw23a7Ui5S9yashEikO.html

The measures will be reviewed every three weeks, along with the rest of the government’s coronavirus response.“As we are taking this action, we’re taking it at a time when it will be most effective,” Patel said. “Now we are past the peak of this virus, we must take steps to guard against imported cases.”Spot checks will be carried out to ensure people are complying with the rules, she said. Patel said there would be a small list of exceptions. They include freight drivers, health staff and foreign officials such as the French police, according to Paul Lincoln, director general of Border Force.Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said on Monday that ministers are considering “air bridges” to allow quarantine-free travel to and from countries where virus infection rates are low -- but Patel made no mention of this in her opening statement.“Introducing a quarantine at this stage makes no sense and will mean very limited international aviation at best,” said Tim Alderslade, chief executive officer of industry lobby group Airlines U.K. “It is just about the worst thing government could do if their aim is to restart the economy.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-arrivals-to-face-1-200-fines-for-breaking-coronavirus-quarantine/story-O5VYhtkRrlJZ11Up00pygI.html

His murder and dismemberment at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October 2018 sparked international outrage, shocked investors in the kingdom and led to Callamard’s UN probe.Khashoggi’s family announced on Friday that they forgave the killers, a decision likely to result in a legal reprieve to the five men sentenced to death for the operation. “We, the sons of the martyr Jamal Khashoggi, announce that we forgive those who killed our father as we hope and seek reward from God Almighty,” Salah Khashoggi, one of the writer’s sons, wrote on Twitter.A Saudi court sentenced the men to death in December but ruled that the assassination wasn’t premeditated and said it didn’t have enough evidence to incriminate two top officials close to Prince Mohammed.A report by Callamard last year found that Saudi agents were recorded discussing how to dismember Khashoggi’s body several minutes before he had entered the consulate in Istanbul, referring to him as a “sacrificial lamb.” Callamard recommended further investigation into Prince Mohammed and his adviser, Saud al-Qahtani, over the murder.“A follow-up investigation must now be undertaken – an investigation focused on the chain of command and associated individual liabilities, including at the highest levels of the state,” she said on Friday. “Justice for Jamal means that we as an international community must do all we can to prevent and stop executions of journalists.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-expert-calls-move-to-forgive-khashoggi-killers-called-a-parody/story-e51ouGnYYxiUXARpFyTCBJ.html

According to the officials, there were at least three survivors from the plane, and it was unknown how many people on the ground were hurt, with at least five houses destroyed.News agency Associated Press reported that a transmission of the pilot Sajjad Gul’s final exchange with air traffic control, posted on the website LiveATC.net, indicated he had failed to land the aircraft and was circling over the congested neighbourhood of Model Colony to make another attempt.Airworthiness documents showed that the plane last received a government check last year on November 1. The international airline’s chief engineer signed a separate certificate n April 28 confirming that all due maintenance of the aircraft that crashed had been conducted. The aircraft, certificate stated, is “fully airworthy and meets all the safety” standards.The papers confirming the ill-fated aircraft’s ownership showed that the Airbus A320 had been previously used by China Eastern Airlines from 2004 to 2014, following which it was inducted in PIA's fleet, news agency AP reported. Here is a look at previous fatal crashes of Pakistani International Airlines:• 1965 - PIA Flight PK 705: A Boeing 720 airliner crashed on May 20, 1965 while descending at Cairo International Airport. Of the 121 passengers and crew on board, all but 6 were killed. This was the inaugural flight of the airline to Cairo which crashed on its efforts to land. The accident, the fourth and worst involving a Boeing 720, was the deadliest to occur in Egypt at the time and remains the third-deadliest.• 1966 - PIA Flight PK 17: On February 2, 1966, a Sikorsky S-61 twin-engined helicopter crashed near Faridpur on a flight from Dhaka to Faridpur after an oil leak developed in the aircraft and the main gearbox failed. 20 passengers and three crew members onboard were killed. One passenger survived.• 1979 - PIA Flight PK 740: A Boeing 707 and also a Hajj flight originating from Kano, Nigeria to Karachi was on its way from Jeddah Saudi Arabia crashed shortly after take off from Jeddah International Airport on November 26, 1979.

The company through its marketing partner in the US, Rising Pharmaceuticals will donate Chloroquine Phosphate (CQ) tablets to support the Phase 2 of a clinical trial at Columbia University, Natco Pharma said in a regulatory filing.  “The trial aims to determine the effectiveness of CQ in preventing COVID-19 infection in healthcare workers with moderate to high risk of exposure to the virus,” it said. Recently, NATCO had donated CQ tablets to a global clinical trial conducted by the CROWN(COVID-19 Research Outcomes Worldwide Network) Collaborative at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. The company said researchers at Columbia University are conducting this critical study to assess CQ as prophylaxis against COVID-19 in healthcare workers. The Phase 2 trial will enrol 350 volunteers who work in direct patient care roles at Columbia University Irving Medical Center and who have contact with patients, who may have COVID-19 infection. NATCO has been supplying CQ tablets, a USFDA approved drug, through its marketing partner to the US since 2011. Columbia University is renowned across the world for its expertise in conducting well designed clinical trials and NATCO is glad to work with them on this path-breaking trial, the company said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-natco-pharma-supports-columbia-university-trials-for-cq-tablets-to-prevent-infections/story-vyoaLciH2ZJGRF0DX9DvSL.html
22-05-2020||World||New study shows hydroxychloroquine for Covid-19 patients raises mortality risk||An antimalarial drug touted by President Donald Trump as a “game changer” in the treatment of Covid-19 significantly increased the risk of death and potentially fatal heart problems among hospitalized patients, in a new and largest analysis yet of use of this medicine published Friday.The study, which was led by an Indian American professor at Harvard Mandeep Mehra, covered 96,000 patients at 671 hospitals on 6 continents.“I wish we had had this information at the outset,” Mehra told The Washington Post, “as there has potentially been harm to patients.”After controlling the data for age, gender, ethnicity and underlying medical conditions, the analysis found that the risk of mortality was 34% higher among patients administered hydroxychloroquine and 137% higher was the chances of developing heart arrhythmias.The mortality risk was even higher at 45% among patients given the antimalarial drug along with an antibiotic — a combination that the US president has promoted with great enthusiasm. The risk of developing heart arrhythmias was significantly higher. Chloroquine fared just as dismally.An earlier observational study of 1,400 Covid-19 patients in New York state hospitals had shown no significant benefit of hydroxychloroquine and an antibiotic among hospitalized patients and had, in fact, pointed higher risk of cardiac arrest among these patients.The new findings come just days after President Trump revealed he had progressed from promoting the drug cocktail to consuming them, with the consent of his White House physician. He started on a two-week regimen after two White House staffers had tested positive for the coronavirus.Trump told reporters Thursday he still has a day to finish the course. He had not commented on the last two studies, but has called one before, any analysis of patients on Veteran Affairs hospital as “false” and called it the work of people who are “not friends of the administration”.President Trump continued to push for expedited opening of the country, with an eye on the November elections when he seeks a second term. Defending his decision to order a ban on travelers from China, Trump said Thursday, “They came in and we did the right thing. We would have lost millions of lives. We did the right thing, but now we’re opening up again. .”All 50 states are now partially open as the deadly virus has continued to take a toll on the country. Fatalities went up by 1,263 in the last 20 hours to 94,729 and infections rose by 25,294 to 1.57 million.Among those killed was Wilson Roosevelt Jerman, who was the longest serving White House employees. He was 91 and had served 11 presidents. His granddaughter told reporters Jerman has started as a cleaner and rose to become a doorman and butler. He retired in 2012. He died last week.“With his kindness and care, Wilson Jerman helped make the White House a home for decades of First Families, including ours,” Michelle Obama, the former first lady, said in a statement. “His service to others –– his willingness to go above and beyond for the country he loved and all those whose lives he touched –– is a legacy worthy of his generous spirit. We were lucky to have known him. Barack and I send our sincerest love and prayers to his family.” Tributes came from other former first families as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-study-shows-hydroxychloroquine-for-covid-19-patients-raises-mortality-risk/story-B9dMfMYcMruGJkmOd6Lx9L.html
22-05-2020||World||Covid-19 update: UK extends visas of stranded Indians, others until July 31||The Boris Johnson government on Friday extended until July 31 the visas of Indian and other non-EU citizens currently in the UK whose visas have expired or are about to expire and are unable to return to their home countries due to lockdowns imposed by the coronavirus pandemic. Their visas had previously been extended until May 31, but a large number of Indians and others are still unable to leave the UK. Over 2,000 stranded Indians have so far returned home in repatriation flights.The visa extension will apply to anyone whose leave expired after January 24 and cannot leave the country because of travel restrictions or self-isolation, the Home Office said, adding that those currently on temporary visas, such as visitor visas, should return home as soon as it is safe and possible to do so.Home secretary Priti Patel said: “By extending people’s visas further, we are giving them peace of mind that they are able to stay in the UK until the end of July if they are unable to leave the country safely”.“This is one of a number of unprecedented measures the government has made to support people during this time, however, as we begin a cautious return to normality those currently in the UK on expired visitor visas should return home as soon as possible”.A dedicated coronavirus immigration team in the Home Office is working with individuals to make the process as straightforward as possible, officials said, adding that anyone in this situation needs to contact the team via an online form to let them know their visa has expired and they will be issued with an extension. No immigration enforcement action will be undertaken during this time against those who contact the Home Office.The Home Office also extended the in-country switching provisions until July 31, which means that people can apply to switch into long-term visa routes whilst remaining in the UK.In light of the current advice on self-isolation and social distancing, the Home Office is also waiving a number of requirements on visa sponsors, such as allowing non-EU nationals here under work or study routes to undertake their work or study from home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-update-uk-extends-visas-of-stranded-indians-others-until-july-31/story-lnLns2vSBRfe3pdLvwLsvO.html
22-05-2020||World||US wants WHO review of Covid-19 response to start ‘now’||The United States says it wants the World Health Organization to start work “now” on a planned independent review of its coordinated international response to the Covid-19 outbreak, at a time the Trump administration has repeatedly criticized the agency and is threatening to cut off U.S. funding for it.Adm. Brett Giroir, an assistant secretary in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, sent a letter to the U.N. health agency’s executive board meeting on Friday saying the United States believes the WHO can “immediately initiate” preparations such as bringing together independent health experts and setting up guidelines for the review.“This review will ensure we have a complete and transparent understanding of the source, timeline of events, and decision-making process for the WHO’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic,” wrote Giroir, who is one of the board’s 34 international members. Giroir did not participate in the board’s first-ever “virtual” meeting.Giroir alluded to a resolution passed Tuesday by the WHO’s assembly calling on Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus to launch a “comprehensive evaluation” of the WHO-coordinated international response to the outbreak “at the earliest appropriate moment.”Tedros, for his part, spoke to the board and pointed proudly to a long list of actions taken by WHO to respond to the outbreak — without directly alluding to the Trump administration pressure that was highlighted by Giroir.“As President Trump just made clear in his May 18 letter to Director-General Tedros, there is no time to waste to begin on the reforms needed to ensure such a pandemic never happens again,” Giroir added. “We applaud the call for an impartial, independent, and comprehensive review, to be undertaken in consultation with member states, and urge that work begin now.”In that same letter, Trump warned he would make permanent a temporary freeze on U.S. funding for the WHO unless it commits to “substantive improvements” within the next 30 days. He has repeatedly criticized the WHO for its early response to the outbreak and praise for China, at a time when Trump’s own response of the outbreak in the United States —the largest in the world — has come under criticism.Giroir, in his statement with a decidedly more diplomatic tone, said the United States was “encouraged” by an initial review by the WHO’s Independent Oversight and Advisory Committee over the January to April period.“We further appreciate the mandate given to the WHO in the resolution to investigate the origins of (the coronavirus), and we are confident that researchers and medical practitioners around the world will be empowered in the pursuit of vaccines and other countermeasures through this knowledge,” Giroir wrote.In a possible sign of the timetable that the United States expects, Giroir said a meeting of the WHO’s assembly this fall “must address the outcome of the review process and lessons learned” from the pandemic response.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-wants-who-review-of-covid-19-response-to-start-now/story-fkL1phkrrEoHwxoTCmLoTL.html
22-05-2020||World||Coronavirus is a stress test many world leaders are failing||If a leader has a political weakness, novel coronavirus is finding it.It’s too early to score countries on their overall responses to a pandemic whose life cycle is likely to be measured in years. Yet it’s clear already that some used the time they had to prepare and act in the critical, early stage of the outbreak far less well than others.In China, the virus revealed a damaging addiction to secrecy, shared by local officials and President Xi Jinping alike. U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s blustering approach to policy cost not only time, but almost his life. In the U.S., President Donald Trump’s chaotic management style and politicization of the outbreak appears to have hampered a rapid, coordinated federal response.In the age-old debate over whether leaders matter in deciding history, the answer from the first few months of 2020 is a resounding “yes they do,” says Francois Heisbourg, a former official in the French foreign and defense ministries who now advises the International Institute of Strategic Studies in London.The costs of being found wanting are potentially high. The death toll from the virus to date is over 330,000, global supply chains have ruptured and millions of jobs have been destroyed. A Bloomberg Economics estimate, based on optimistic recovery scenarios, projects the pandemic will carve $6 trillion out of the global economy.Much of the political impact from mistakes made has been obscured to date by a “rally around the flag” effect that has – with a few exceptions – shielded leaders across the board from criticism and seen their popularity rise, a pattern familiar from times of war. But that protective effect is starting to fade.On Wednesday, U.K. opposition Labour Party leader Keir Starmer attacked Johnson in Parliament for having been late to protect care homes from Covid-19, late to expand testing, and now late with the rollout of tracing and isolation policies that helped Germany and South Korea control the pandemic.The contrast between Johnson’s early counter-virus efforts and those of Germany, led by trained chemist and Chancellor Angela Merkel, is stark. The virus was discovered in both countries at the end of January, but by early March – a time when Johnson was still making a show of shaking hands in crowds - Germany was declaring a protective equipment emergency and was developing tests for mass production. The number of Covid-19 deaths per million inhabitants is now four times as high in the U.K. as in Germany.Urged by Johnson on Wednesday to be less negative and recognize the government’s plan to have a “world beating” test, track and isolate system in place by June 1, Starmer replied: “34,000 deaths is negative. Of course I’m going to ask about that.” On Thursday, the official fatality number stood at 36,042.Still, Johnson has carefully deferred to scientists and made a big pitch to depoliticize the crisis by lavishing praise and attention on the National Health Service, sometimes described as the closest Britain has to a national religion. Not so Trump.Across the Atlantic, the crisis supercharged the president’s tendency to dismiss science, politicize the most technical of issues and institutions, and eschew international cooperation. He also muddied any consistent federal role or messaging by imposing himself in some areas while disclaiming responsibility in others, and by diverting attention to other issues with as many as 126 tweets in a day.It isn’t clear whether voters will see the resulting chaos as failure on Trump’s part when they decide whether to re-elect him on Nov. 3. In the latest Quinnipiac University poll, released on Wednesday, 50% of registered voters said they backed presumed Democratic nominee Joe Biden, against 39% for Trump.China’s response revealed two core weaknesses of Xi and the one-party system he leads, according to Willy Lam, adjunct professor at the Center for China Studies in the Chinese University of Hong Kong. The first is a lack of transparency, from lowly officials reluctant to pass bad news upward for fear of damaging their careers, to Xi and other party leaders determined to announce only success.The delays this caused in tackling the disease before it could spread abroad have cost Xi in terms of international soft power, says Lam. They also handed ammunition to Trump, as he sought to place blame for U.S. Covid-19 deaths on China and the World Health Organization.Xi’s iron grip on China’s institutions means “he remains as powerful as ever,” said Lam. Yet a second weakness exposed by the crisis – reliance of the unelected Communist Party on rapid economic growth for its legitimacy – could prove damaging, he added, as a global recession makes greater prosperity impossible to deliver.The government on Friday abandoned its decades-long practice of publishing a hard growth target, reflecting its concern over how the economic showdown will play at home. In a sign of the geopolitical implications such insecurities could have going forward, China also confirmed it was introducing national security laws on Hong Kong that would effectively bypass the city’s legislature.In India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi retains strong popular support so far, even as economic hardship from the nation’s 50-day lockdown has begun to bite. Yet Modi suffers in comparison with his own nation’s Kerala state where, according to news reports, a health minister kept the population of almost 35 million all but untouched by launching an aggressive test, track and isolate operation in late January, long before the national government began to act in March.Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro, who continues to deny the seriousness of the virus, looks more exposed. The former army captain has so far burned through two health ministers during the crisis and clashed with regional governors over lockdown restrictions, putting his lack of management experience into sharp relief. Until he became president last year, Bolsonaro had never held an executive role in government.Leadership is just one factor that may explain the huge variations in the impact Covid-19 has had in different countries. Among the most important: whether nations had recent experience with similar epidemics, a reason nations in Asia and Australasia have tended to be more sure-footed in their responses. Other factors include age demographics, population density, health system capacity and culture.Still, leadership has an effect. In Russia, President Vladimir Putin’s reputation for crisis management has taken a pounding – and not necessarily because of Covid-19 infection or death rates. Anger is rising over damage to the economy, forecast to shrink 5.5% this year. With government coffers already suffering from low oil revenues -- made worse by Russia’s price war with Saudi Arabia -- and sanctions imposed after Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea, Putin has been either unable or unwilling to release sufficient funds to cushion the blow.“Resentment toward the authorities is far deeper than it was before the pandemic,” said Olga Kryshtanovskaya, a sociologist who studies the elite at the State University of Management in Moscow. A recent survey by the independent Levada polling agency gave Putin 59% support, down from 63% a month earlier and his lowest rating since 2000.In Russia, though, as in some other countries, it may be difficult to separate leadership missteps from those of the state. Heisbourg, the former French official, served on a pandemic preparation committee after SARS-CoV, or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, threatened Europe in 2003. On its recommendation, France bought and stockpiled 1.25 billion face masks, among other measures, he says, but then failed to maintain the stocks as they expired over the years.Rather than acknowledge the mistake and correct it when the coronavirus struck this year, the French government spent weeks arguing that masks – ubiquitous in the fight against the virus in Asia -- had little utility. President Emmanuel Macron’s imperious style of governing, often described as Jupiterian, appeared to exacerbate a weakness that’s deep in the DNA of the French state.“We have a Napoleonic system,” said Heisbourg, “and in a Napoleonic system the state can do no wrong.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-is-a-stress-test-many-world-leaders-are-failing/story-sOwMZjNw0Rc6LFyi8vkOOK.html

22-05-2020||World||Lancet study finds no benefit for hydroxychloroquine in Covid-19 patients||Boston, May 22 (PTI) Treatment for Covid-19 with the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine, either with or without the antibiotic azithromycin, offers no benefit for Covid-19 patients, according to a large observational study. The research, published in the journal The Lancet, analysed data from nearly 15,000 patients with Covid-19 who received chloroquine or its analogue hydroxychloroquine, taken with or without the antibiotics azithromycin or clarithromycin, and 81,000 controls. According to the researchers, including Mandeep Mehra from Brigham and Women’s Hospital in the US, Covid-19 patients on these drug regimens, experienced an increased risk of serious heart rhythm complications. The scientists said these drugs should not be used to treat Covid-19 patients outside of clinical trials until results from randomised clinical trials are available to confirm their safety and efficacy for Covid-19 patients. They explained chloroquine, an antimalarial drug and its analogue, hydroxychloroquine, are commonly used to treat autoimmune diseases including lupus and arthritis. Both these drugs have a good safety profile as treatments for those specific conditions, and the current research said these patients should not stop taking these drugs if they are prescribed for approved conditions. While these drugs have shown antiviral effects in laboratory tests, and are of interest as potential treatments against SARS-CoV-2, the current study has found that they do not benefit patients undergoing treatment for Covid-19. “This is the first large scale study to find statistically robust evidence that treatment with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine does not benefit patients with Covid-19,” Mehra said. According to Mehra, the findings suggest the drugs may be associated with an increased risk of serious heart problems and increased risk of death. “Randomised clinical trials are essential to confirm any harms or benefits associated with these agents. In the meantime, we suggest these drugs should not be used as treatments for Covid-19 outside of clinical trials.” he said. In the current study, the scientists analysed data from 96,032 patients hospitalised between 20 December 2019 and 14 April 2020 with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from 671 hospitals. All of the patients included in the study had either been discharged or had died by 21 April 2020, the scientists said. They compared outcomes from patients treated with chloroquine alone, hydroxychloroquine alone, chloroquine in combination with azithromycin or clarithromycin, or hydroxychloroquine with one of the antibiotics. Patients from these four groups were compared with the remaining control group of 81,144 patients, the researchers said. At the end of the study period, around one in 11 patients in the control group had died in hospital, they said. According to the scientists, all four of the treatments were associated with a higher risk of dying in hospital. The team also found that serious irregular heartbeats called arrhythmias, which cause the lower chamber of the heart to beat rapidly, were more common in the groups receiving either of the four treatment regimens. The researchers said around one in six of those treated with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine alone had died. When used in combination with one of the antibiotics, the study said the death rate rose to more than one in five for chloroquine, and almost one in four for hydroxychloroquine. According to the study, some of the difference in the rates of mortality is due to underlying differences between patients who received the treatments and those who didn’t. It noted that on accounting for factors like age, race, body weight, and underlying health conditions such as heart disease, lung disease, and diabetes, the drug regimens were associated with an increased risk of death. The excess risk attributable to the use of the drug regimen rather than other factors such as co-morbidities ranged from 34 to 45 per cent, they said. If the rate of mortality is 9.3 per cent in the control group, the scientists said, on adjustment for other clinical factors, the rate attributable to the use of the drug regimens would rise to 12.4-13.4 per cent. However, they said it is not possible to exclude the possibility of unmeasured factors being responsible for the link. They said this is due to the design of observational studies, and warned that randomised trials are urgently needed to validate the findings. While several countries have advocated use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, either alone or in combination, as potential treatments for Covid-19, the evidence that they help patients recover from the disease is small, the scientists concluded. “Justification for repurposing these medicines in this way is based on a small number of anecdotal experiences that suggest they may have beneficial effects for people infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus,” said Frank Ruschitzka from the University Hospital Zurich in Germany, who also co-authored the study. Ruschitzka said, previous small-scale studies have also failed to identify robust evidence of a benefit from these drugs, adding that larger, randomised controlled trials are not yet completed. “However, we now know from our study that the chance that these medications improve outcomes in Covid-19 is quite low,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lancet-study-finds-no-benefit-for-hydroxychloroquine-in-covid-19-patients/story-wylQ8uQS68z2B67NEbz9xI.html
22-05-2020||World||UK’s Covid-19 study aims to vaccinate more than 10,000||British researchers testing an experimental vaccine against the new coronavirus are moving into advanced studies and aim to immunize more than 10,000 people to determine if the shot works.Last month, scientists at Oxford University began vaccinating more than 1,000 volunteers in a preliminary study designed to test the shot’s safety. Those results aren’t in yet but on Friday, the scientists announced they’re expanding to 10,260 people across Britain, including older people and children.If all goes smoothly, “it’s possible as early as the autumn or toward the end of the year, you could have results that allowed use of the vaccine on a wider scale,” predicted Andrew Pollard, head of the Oxford Vaccine Group.But Pollard acknowledged there were still many challenges ahead, including how long it will take to prove the vaccine works — particularly since transmission has dropped significantly in Britain — and any potential manufacturing complications.The Oxford shot is one of about a dozen experimental vaccines in early stages of human testing or poised to start, mostly in China, the U.S. and Europe. Scientists have never created vaccines from scratch this fast and it’s far from clear that any of the candidates will ultimately prove safe and effective.Moving on to such a huge late-scale test doesn’t guarantee the Oxford candidate will reach the finish line, either. Pollard couldn’t provide any data from the first tests, but said an oversight board hasn’t seen any indications of worrisome side effects.A small study in monkeys offers a note of caution: The Oxford team and researchers from the U.S. National Institutes of Health found the vaccine protected against pneumonia but didn’t eliminate the coronavirus in the nose. Pollard said it was still an open question whether the shot could make a dent in how the disease spreads.Another question addressed in the next stage of testing is how the shot will affect older adults, who are at high risk from COVID-19. Pollard noted those over 70 often don’t get as much protection from vaccines as younger people.Earlier this week, drugmaker AstraZeneca said it had secured its first agreements to produce 400 million doses of the Oxford-developed vaccine, bolstered by a $1 billion investment from a U.S. government agency.The AstraZeneca investment hopefully will make the vaccine available globally, including in developing countries, said Lawrence Young of the University of Warwick. But he cautioned the shot’s effectiveness still is unclear, citing the monkey research.“This raises serious questions about the ability of this vaccine to protect against infection in humans and to prevent virus transmission,” he said in a statement. “We need to be urgently exploring other vaccine candidates.”Often, possible vaccines that look promising early fail after testing expands to thousands of people — one reason the crowded field is important. Many of the candidates work in different ways, and are made with different technologies, increasing the odds that at least one approach might succeed.Most of the vaccines in the pipeline aim to train the immune system to recognize the spiky protein that studs the new coronavirus’ outer surface, so it’s primed to attack if the real infection comes along. The Oxford vaccine uses a harmless virus — a chimpanzee cold virus, engineered so it can’t spread — to carry genes for the spike protein into the body. A Chinese company created a similar shot.Other leading vaccine candidates, including one from the NIH and Moderna Inc., and another by Inovio Pharmaceuticals, simply inject a piece of the coronavirus genetic code that instructs the body itself to produce spike protein that primes the immune system.Meanwhile, companies and governments are beginning to scale up production now, aiming for hundreds of millions of doses of the candidates they think might win the vaccine race.It’s a huge gamble that could waste a lot of money if their choices fail and must be thrown away. But if they get lucky and a stockpiled vaccine pans out, it could help mass vaccinations start a few months faster.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-s-covid-19-study-aims-to-vaccinate-more-than-10-000/story-Icu84QqvjPd7tcqVpY9KlJ.html

22-05-2020||World||China initiates process of sharing hydrological data for Sutlej, 10 days before scheduled date||Nearly 10 days before its scheduled date, China has initiated the process of sharing hydrological data for the Sutlej river with India, an annual practice during the monsoon which is crucial for generating information on floods in north India, officials said on Friday. According to an agreement signed between the two countries, China shares hydrological data of the Brahmaputra and Sutlej rivers with India from May 15 and June 1, respectively, until the end of October. For the Sutlej river, known as Langqen Zangbod in China, data is shared from a station at Tsada, the officials said. The river, a major tributary of the Indus, originates in Tibet and enters India through Himachal Pradesh. This year, China initiated the process on May 18-19, nearly 10 days before the scheduled date, the officials added. The development comes amid the recent face-offs between the armies of the two countries at the eastern and northern borders of India. On Thursday, India had said that the Chinese military was hindering normal patrolling by its troops along the Line of Actual Control in Ladakh and Sikkim. It also strongly refuted China’s contention that the escalating tension between the two armies was triggered by trespassing of Indian forces across the Chinese side. Around 250 Indian and Chinese army personnel clashed with iron rods, sticks, and even resorted to stone-pelting in Pangong Tso area in Eastern Ladakh on May 5. Four days later, there was a similar face-off near Naku La Pass in North Sikkim. The data is crucial for India for generating flood-related information in north and northeast India, the officials said. Prior to the sharing of data, both sides check whether the existing data sharing systems are working fine. Accordingly, China sends a test mail with data that has to be acknowledged by India, signifying that the communication line is working fine. But this usually happens two to three days before the actual data sharing begins, the officials said. Data sharing for the Brahmaputra river started from May 15. In 2017, China had stopped sharing the data citing that the hydrological data gathering sites were washed away due to floods. It also coincided with the 73-day Doklam stand-off between the two neighbours that took place during the peak monsoon period. It resumed sharing data from 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-initiates-process-of-sharing-hydrological-data-for-sutlej-10-days-before-scheduled-date/story-OFBxcZIoEg6xCvZICnlaiO.html

22-05-2020||World||Joe Biden accuser’s life marred by abuse and financial hardship||One thing is clear in the complicated, sometimes contradictory and often chaotic story of Tara Reade: Her life has not been easy.Her earliest childhood memory was of being abused by her father, she told her former husband, a man she would later leave after he abused her, too.She was also a child of big dreams, of being an Olympic skier and studying acting at Juilliard, before developing an interest in politics. She was hired in 1992 for a low-level staff job for one of the nation’s highest-profile senators at the time, Joe Biden. Less than a year later, Reade said, she was again the victim of abuse, assaulted by Biden in the hallway of a Senate office building — an allegation he vehemently denies.That accusation, which Reade made publicly for the first time in March, has revived difficult questions about how to evaluate allegations of assault in the era of #MeToo. It also has thrust Reade’s life story into the 2020 presidential race and, with it, scrutiny of a woman with a winding trail of extreme debt, an unfounded claim of educational attainment and questionable business practices. Along the way, some people who dealt with her found her duplicitous and deceitful, while others found her a heroic survivor.And Reade’s story about the alleged assault by Biden is hardly a straight line. It has changed over the past year, from accusations of uncomfortable, harassing behavior to allegations of assault. Reade came forward publicly with her most serious accusation just as Biden was securing a path to the Democratic presidential nomination.It is often not possible to conclusively resolve an allegation like the one Reade has made, where there are no witnesses and no timely police report.So how her claim is evaluated turns largely on her credibility.By some accounts, Reade is a bright and engaging woman who has tried her best as a single mother to raise her daughter while constantly looking for a fresh start. In others, Reade uses her charm and flair for drama to manipulate those supporting her until their goodwill runs out.Reade says her critics have her wrong.“I’m not a lying, manipulative user,” she said in a Wednesday interview with The Associated Press. “I’ve really understood what it’s like to be struggling and poor. I’ve really tried to help people when I could.”This account of Reade’s life is based on interviews with more than a dozen of her friends, relatives and personal and professional associates, as well as numerous interviews with Reade. The AP also reviewed hundreds of pages of court documents, emails and Reade’s own writings.CHILDHOOD OF DREAMS, DISAPPOINTMENTReade was born Tara Moulton in the coastal town of Monterey, California, and says she spent most of her childhood living on a farm in northern Wisconsin. Her father, Robert Reade Moulton, worked as a sportswriter for the Wausau Daily Herald in the 1960s before taking a public relations job with a defense contractor in Minnesota; Reade said her mother, Jeanette Altimus, was an artist.Reade has written that she was an accomplished skier who qualified for the Junior Olympics team in downhill skiing at age 12 in Wisconsin and trained for three years before her parents’ divorce prompted a move to Athens, Georgia.A stepbrother said most people in Wausau skied, mainly at nearby Rib Mountain, but he does not remember Reade being a standout.“I’m sure Tara did, but I don’t really remember her getting some significant accolades for her performance,” said Scott Thoma, 56, of Mound, Minnesota, who was a year ahead of Reade in middle school, when his mother married her father.Reade and her brother Collin lived with her mother after her parents’ split, eventually moving to Georgia, while Moulton and his new wife moved to the Minneapolis area.Another of Reade’s aspirations was to be an actress, performing in “school theatre, community and regional theatre, sprinkled with some radio and television commercials,” according to her blog. She set out for California to pursue acting at age 17 and said she got a referral from a friend to informally train with Robert Reed, an actor best known for his role as the “Brady Bunch” father. She also said she scored an audition in New York for The Juilliard School’s exclusive acting program.Reade said she learned at the audition that no scholarships were available and returned home brokenhearted when her father said he wouldn’t pay the tuition. The school declined to confirm whether Reade was selected for an audition.She wrote in January that her father, who died in 2016, was physically and emotionally abusive throughout her childhood.“Thwarting my college dreams was the mild bit, the rejection and the physical assaults set the stage for how I would walk into the world,” she wrote.Reade often discussed the issue with her former husband, Ted Dronen, according to Dronen’s account in the couple’s divorce filings.“She referenced a long history of events dating back to her first memories in which her father would physically and emotionally, and mentally abuse her. She stated also that her mother seemed not to interfere with petitioner’s father’s abuse,” he wrote.Thoma described Reade’s parents as alcoholics but said he never saw Moulton become angry when he drank, or emotionally or physically abuse Reade or anyone else.“He got frustrated at her,” said Thoma, adding that Reade started more things than she finished. “He would have to put the kibosh on whatever she wanted. But no, I never saw Bob lay a hand on any of us kids, or Collin and Tara.”Dronen, in the court documents, described Reade as also having a sometimes tumultuous relationship with her mother, who he said kicked her out of her house during a fall 1994 argument while Reade was in the late stages of a pregnancy.Reade has said her mother, who also died in 2016, was one of the few people she confided in about Biden’s alleged assault.Early abuse can inform a victim’s relationships for the rest of his or her life, according to Barbara Ziv, a forensic psychologist and sexual assault expert.“If you grow up in an abusive household, where your needs, your basic needs aren’t met and you aren’t taught to appropriately identify boundaries or emotions, then that’s going to impact the way that you develop as an adult,” Ziv said.AN EYE TOWARD POLITICSThere’s little public accounting of the next few years of Reade’s life, after she says her Juilliard dreams were dashed.She eventually attended Pasadena City College, where she says her strong performance in a political science class helped her land an internship in Washington with then-California Rep. Leon Panetta.Reade said in the 2019 interview that she then worked as a field manager for Santa Barbara County Supervisor Gloria Ochoa in her campaign against Rep. Michael Huffington, the former husband of Arianna Huffington. A few days after Ochoa’s loss, Reade said, she got a call to interview for a job with Biden — which she described as a dream job. It was unclear how that interview came about.“I just always wanted to work for Biden. Because at the time, he was the champion of women’s legislation, women’s rights legislation,” she told the AP.Reade said she traveled to Washington and was interviewed by Biden’s executive assistant, Marianne Baker. During their conversation, she said, Biden walked in and was introduced to the young job prospect.“He kind of smiled and said, ‘Hire her,’” Reade said. “That was it.”WORKING FOR BIDENOnce she was in Washington, multiple friends described Reade as a young woman coming into her own.Stacey Lentz, a friend at the time who worked in North Dakota Sen. Kent Conrad’s office, said the two would get together for lunch on Capitol Hill, and on days off, they’d peruse antique shops or enjoy a ballgame.Another close friend of Reade’s, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect her family’s privacy, described her as a laid-back Californian in contrast to her own East Coast conservative upbringing. All three lived in Thompson Markward Hall, a women’s dormitory across the street from the Hart Senate Office Building.Over the years, Reade spoke favorably about working for Biden.Margie Estberg, of Aptos, California, said she got to know Reade after hiring her in late 2017 to pet sit. Over a pizza dinner and cocktails in 2018, Estberg said she asked Reade what Biden was like — and whether Biden was one of the “bad guys.”“I said, ‘Is he a nice guy?’ And she said, ‘Yeah, he is,’” Estberg recently recalled. “I said, ’Oh, good. Because I hate to see somebody who you think is a decent person and somebody shuts them down and says, ‘No, they aren’t.’”Reade said she didn’t share details of the alleged assault with Estberg because she wasn’t ready to discuss it.But Reade’s friend, the one who spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity, said Reade told her a much different story about Biden in 1993. That’s when Reade says she was asked to deliver a gym bag to Biden in a Senate office building; when she met him, she says, he kissed her and digitally penetrated her.The friend said Reade called her a few nights after the assault allegedly occurred, and the friend described in vivid detail feeling “so physically sick” at the disclosure that she ran to the bathroom and threw up in the middle of their conversation.Reade recommended that the AP interview the friend, and reporters spoke to her multiple times, beginning in 2019. Initially, the friend confirmed Reade’s original, limited account of harassment by Biden. When Reade added assault to her allegation in March of this year, this friend also added those details to her own recollection.This friend says she counseled Reade not to file a police report, and now expresses deep regret for what she characterized as leading Reade astray in dealing with the situation.Reade left Washington shortly after the alleged assault. She says she tried to complain about harassment by Biden — but not assault — to a Senate personnel office and the senator’s top advisers, but felt retaliated against and ultimately said she was encouraged to find another job and quit.MARRIAGE, DIVORCE, ABUSEDuring her time in Washington, Reade met Ted Dronen, whom she describes in a 2009 essay as “a smiling 6’4” blonde Nordic-looking man” who playfully shot her with a water gun at a party one spring night in 1993.Facing financial difficulties after leaving Biden’s office, Reade moved in with Dronen and ultimately asked to follow him to North Dakota, where he was working on a campaign that winter, according to his account in court records.In her divorce filing, Reade described early warning signs that Dronen was explosive and unstable and says she fled North Dakota for California after Dronen became upset that she was pregnant. She soon came back to him, however, and they married in July 1994 and had a daughter that November.In a domestic violence case filed 15 months later, Dronen admits that he attacked Reade but alleges that Reade got violent with him as well.“I admit that on February 21, 1996 my wife and I were involved in a heated argument and during that argument that I may have acted out in an inappropriate manner. During our marriage my wife and I had arguments. She has on past occasions struck me; specifically, in the face. That fact, however, does not excuse my conduct on the date in question,” he states.Dronen did not respond to several requests for comment.In court documents, he suggested that Reade conflated childhood traumas with her recollections of abuse by him.“I believe these incidences, in addition to the abuse, harassment and other truamatic (sic) events in Petitioner’s life, color Petitioner’s perception and judgment in the instant case and I believe them to be the underlying psychological reasons that Petitioner is making me out to be some sort of monster,” he said.During their divorce proceedings, Dronen also told the court that Reade said she was harassed while working in Biden’s office, but made no mention of assault, a detail that was first reported by the San Luis Obispo Tribune.“On several occasions petitioner related a problem that she was having at work regarding sexual harassment in U.S. Senator Joe Biden’s office,” he wrote. Reade “eventually struck a deal” with Biden’s chief of staff and left the office, and Dronen supported her financially as she looked for work.TURBULENT TIMESThe past two decades of Reade’s life have been tumultuous. In her own telling, she had to flee Dronen’s abuse, took shelter in domestic violence safe houses and moved to Washington state, where she changed her name to Alexandra Tara McCabe. She also said she received a new Social Security number to protect her safety, putting her in a “really vulnerable economic situation.”She said the focus on her financial difficulties since coming forward with her allegation against Biden was “classist” and should have no bearing on the credibility of her accusation.“How high does your credit score have to be to be believed as a victim of sexual assault?” Reade asked.Reade’s resume states that she graduated from Antioch University with a bachelor’s degree in political science and later worked at the school’s Seattle campus as an “Ongoing Online Visiting Professor for degree completion.” But school officials said she did not graduate and was never a faculty member, though she was paid to do several hours of administrative work as an independent contractor.Reade disputed this, but could not produce evidence that she graduated.She was accepted to Seattle University Law School through an alternative admissions program and obtained a law degree in 2004, but struggled to keep a job. She was helped by sympathetic strangers drawn to her story of escaping abuse, but often failed to meet financial obligations and was perpetually in debt and frequently entangled in legal battles.By May 2006, she was back in California, working as a victims’ advocate for the Monterey County YWCA.There, Reade lodged a series of complaints with the chapter’s board within months of taking the job, alleging that she and others were harassed and discriminated against by managers, which formed the basis of a 2007 lawsuit.Reade and three co-workers alleged that two managers, who were both black, potentially misspent funds and favored African American employees who were members of their church. One supervisor, the lawsuit alleged, made racist comments. Meanwhile, Reade and her three co-workers, all of whom were white, said they were denied benefits and promotions.“I find your response to my recent complaint unacceptable. Therefore, I am taking the next step to get some resolution,” Reade wrote in a Nov. 9, 2006, memo to her boss.She was also upset because someone called her “whitebread,” according to the memo, which was circulated to the board.Bridgette Allen, the former YWCA chapter president, was among those sued. She said she viewed Reade’s persistent emails as an effort to build a court case.“I was the first black board president in the history here. You have to look at the dynamics: It was four white women that accused three black women,” Allen said.But to some of Reade’s co-workers, she was a hero empowered by a difficult past.“She was such a great example of what I wanted to be as a mom and a woman and an advocate,” said Diane Wegner, a former YWCA employee who was part of the lawsuit, which was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum.Reade soon found a new job as executive director at the Animal Friends Rescue Project in Pacific Grove.She also needed a new place to live and, in 2008, turned to Austin Chung, an inexperienced property manager, and inquired about a cottage he was renting out that offered a glimpse of the waves at nearby Monterey Bay.She told him she was fleeing abuse and had no credit history, explaining her change of name and Social Security number. But she did have a law degree and a job, she told him.“My heart went out to her right away,” Chung said.Chung said he had the interior painted and installed new flooring to make the home welcoming.Within five months, she was behind on rent. Pretty soon, she was out of a job, too, after her management style grated on some employees and supporters of the animal shelter, according to former board members.“There wasn’t any one big thing that happened. It was just, over time, her not really being competent,” said Carie Broecker, a longtime former board member. Broecker said she remained friends with Reade until Reade recently threatened to sue her because she publicly discussed her tenure at the agency.Reade said she was proud of her work for the animal shelter.Chung moved to evict Reade after she fell $3,600 behind on rent; Reade accused him of harassment in an email.She eventually left behind a house in need of $8,000 in repairs that included carpets so stained by animal waste that they needed to be replaced, according to Chung, who provided emails and video footage of the home’s interior.In 2011, Reade was again in a relationship that turned violent. Neighbors called Santa Cruz police to her home, and her live-in boyfriend, Edward Walker, was charged with corporal injury and battery against Reade and her daughter.“Male subject battered live-in girlfriend, causing visible injury. During the altercation, the suspect also battered the victims daughter,” police said in an April 3, 2011 report.Reade, who had spent years testifying in court as an advocate for domestic violence victims, acknowledged that Walker slapped her daughter at one point. She paid his bail and continued to live with Walker, caring for him after he suffered a stroke in 2012, court records show.Walker, who could not be reached for comment, pleaded guilty and was given probation. A judge dismissed the charges in 2016.Financial and legal turmoil followed her as she continued to move around California’s central coast, living in some of the most scenic and affluent parts of the state:— She sought a restraining order in 2012 against a neighbor whom she accused of harassment and making racist threats against Walker. A judge dismissed the petition, and Reade dropped the matter.— Months later, Reade was evicted again over $12,750 in unpaid rent. She filed for bankruptcy and listed $406,407 in debts, including nearly $300,000 in unpaid school loans, $1,715 owed to a bail bondsman and $2,100 due to a locally owned grocery store.— Reade enrolled in an advanced legal degree program through Southwestern Law School. The school sued Reade in 2016 over $22,000 in loans, which remain unpaid, according to an attorney working on the case.— She launched a charity that aimed to provide pet food to impoverished animal owners. The group’s nonprofit status was revoked in 2017 after Reade failed to submit three years of mandatory tax filings, though she continued to solicit donations. In 2016, Reade tweeted that she was raising money for a nonprofit called Boudicca Rising Legal Assistance, which included a link to a GoFundMe page she created. There is no record of a nonprofit by that name in the IRS database. Reade raised $210 but said she eventually abandoned the effort because it was too difficult to sort out the logistics.In 2014, Reade started volunteering at a Watsonville, California, nonprofit horse farm called the Pregnant Mare Rescue. She proved to be a dedicated volunteer who excelled at caring for abused horses, but “always had drama and craziness going on in her life,” according to Lynn Hummer, the organization’s founder.“She was always broke and in a crisis,” Hummer said.The two had a falling out in 2016 after Reade charged $1,400 in veterinary care for her horse to the Pregnant Mare Rescue, billing records show.In a June 8, 2016, email to Hummer, Reade acknowledged that she charged the bill to the organization but said that she was poor, that her mother’s health was failing and that she was “disgusted and appalled” that Hummer would “villainize” her poverty.Reade said that she planned on paying back the money but decided against it after Hummer “started trashing me” on social media.At the time, Reade had been asking for money to finance a cross-country move to take care of her mother. She also told acquaintances that Dronen, her ex-husband, had reappeared and was harassing her.According to a letter from a domestic violence advocacy group that Reade shared, Dronen sent her and her daughter “friend requests” via Facebook after 15 years without contact, and the two were scared for their safety. She also inquired about changing her legal name back to Tara Reade, which she goes by now.Eventually, a man in Seattle raised $3,500 for her through GoFundMe.FALLOUTReade says her decision to go public with her claims against Biden has brought her more hardship. She describes facing death threats online and feeling abused and abandoned by the Democratic Party, which she says she’s supported her whole life. Numerous prominent Democrats have said they believe Biden’s denials.But she’s targeted critics, too. Reade said she recently filed a police report against Hummer in Nevada County, California, and Reade’s attorney, Douglas Wigdor, followed up last week with a cease-and-desist letter, accusing the former friend of making statements that were “intended to tarnish and impugn Ms. Reade’s character and reputation.”Still, Reade, a woman who’s spent her life trying to regain her footing in the face of myriad setbacks, said her decision to come forward has been empowering.“It’s made my life so difficult in so many ways, but I’m doing this for more of an existential reason, and also for my own justice,” she said. When she first spoke out about the sexual assault allegation, Reade said, “I felt this release, of this burden, this secret that I’ve kept.”___Jaffe and Slodysko reported from Washington; Dale reported from Philadelphia.

22-05-2020||World||Militaries of India and China on high alert as border tensions escalate||Talks between the Indian and Chinese military to end escalating tensions along their disputed border have ended in a deadlock as the fragile peace shows signs of breaking down.Border incidents are at their highest since 2015, senior Indian security officials said. The two sides held talks on Tuesday aimed at lowering the temperature between the nuclear-armed neighbors, however neither army was willing to compromise, the officials said, asking not to be identified citing rules on speaking to the media.The armies are currently on a high-alert at two locations along the Line of Actual Control -- the 3,488 kilometer (2,167 mile) unmarked boundary between India and China. Additional troops have been rushed to the border by both sides, the officials said. They are facing each other at the Galwan River, which was one of the early triggers of the 1962 India-China war, and at the disputed Pangong Tso -- a glacial lake at 14,000 feet in the Tibetan plateau, portions of which are claimed by both.The inconclusive talks came as the US issued a tough statement on China. In Washington, senior diplomat Alice Wells said the clashes were a “reminder that Chinese aggression is not always just rhetorical.”“Whether it’s in the South China Sea or whether it’s along the border with India, we continue to see provocations and disturbing behaviour by China that raises questions about how China seeks to use its growing power,” Wells, acting assistant secretary for South and Central Asia, said on a briefing call to reporters on May 20.China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs was not immediately availabe for comment, however spokesman Zhao Lijian told reporters at a regular briefing in Beijing on May 13: “We urge the Indian side to work with China, refrain from taking any complicating moves so as to create enabling conditions for the development of our bilateral relations and peace and stability in border areas.”“Any suggestion that Indian troops had undertaken activity across the LAC in the Western Sector or the Sikkim sector is not accurate,” Anurag Srivastava, the spokesman for India’s Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement on Thursday. “All Indian activities are entirely on the Indian side of the LAC. In fact, it is Chinese side that has recently undertaken activity hindering India’s normal patrolling patterns.”Contentious RoadAccording to data from Indian security officials, the India-China border has been unusually active since last year with a 64% rise in incidents since 2018. Along the sensitive “Eastern Sector” -- from Bhutan, stretching east along the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh -- incidents doubled last year in comparison to 2018. China claims a 2,000-sq km stretch of land in this sector, which is defended by at least 20,000 Indian soldiers along with paramilitary forces.Border incidents in the “Western Sector” -- stretching from northwestern Tibet, along the Indian state of Uttarakhand and the Union Territory of Ladakh, stretching to the critical Karakorum Pass -- have witnessed a 75% rise in 2019.The Indian officials say China is objecting to a road it’s building at the Pangong Tso that connects to disputed border. On May 5 and 6, troops clashed on the banks of the lake, leaving scores of soldiers on both sides injured. On May 9, several soldiers were injured when the two armies clashed near a three-way junction between Bhutan, China and India, close to the site of the Doklam standoff.The Indian Army would not comment on the tensions, with spokesman Aman Anand on Thursday referring Bloomberg to a statement issued on May 12 that acknowledged incidents of aggressive behavior along the border.”I take the current border situation very seriously,” said Ashok K. Kantha, director of the New Delhi-based Institute of Chinese Studies and a former Indian ambassador to Beijing, adding that he didn’t “see these as isolated incidents but in conjunction China’s aggressive behavior in the South China Sea. There is a larger pattern to border incidents.”Informal SummitsThere had been a significant dip in tensions in 2018 that followed an informal summit between India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping in the Chinese city of Wuhan. The meeting between the leaders -- held after stand off of more than 70 days between the two armies on the Doklam peninsula in 2017 -- was followed up with a second summit in Mamallapuram near the southern Indian city of Chennai in October last year.At that meeting, Xi and Modi agreed to give “strategic guidance” to their respective armies. That included less aggressive patrols on the border, informing the other side of incoming patrols and more contact between local military commanders to reduce friction.In a recent interview with Bloomberg, India’s Chief of Defense Staff Bipin Rawat said the strategic guidance was working, but noted a hot-line connecting the top leaders of the two armies that was proposed as far back as 2013 would help reduce tensions. “I think the hot-line between the two armies is required,” Rawat said. Even though the two countries are in touch through diplomatic channels, he added “we would like a military level communication as well.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/militaries-of-india-and-china-on-high-alert-as-border-tensions-escalate/story-jMuroxwVnpIXZoR8x8YLwO.html

22-05-2020||World||‘Trump enemy statement, political hit job’: How US President targeted scientists||“A Trump enemy statement,” he said of one study.“A political hit job,” he said of another.As President Donald Trump pushes to reopen the country despite warnings from doctors about the consequences of moving too quickly during the coronavirus crisis, he has been lashing out at scientists whose conclusions he doesn’t like.Twice this week, Trump has not only dismissed the findings of studies but suggested — without evidence — that their authors were motivated by politics and out to undermine his efforts to roll back coronavirus restrictions.First it was a study funded in part by his own government’s National Institutes of Health that raised alarms about the use of hydroxychloroquine, finding higher overall mortality in coronavirus patients who took the drug while in Veterans Administration hospitals. Trump and many of his allies had been trumpeting the drug as a miracle cure and Trump this week revealed that he has been taking it to try to ward off the virus — despite an FDA warning last month that it should only be used in hospital settings or clinical trials because of the risk of serious side effects, including life-threatening heart problems.“If you look at the one survey, the only bad survey, they were giving it to people that were in very bad shape. They were very old, almost dead,” Trump told reporters Tuesday. “It was a Trump enemy statement.”He offered similar pushback Thursday to a new study from Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health. It found that more than 61% of COVID-19 infections and 55% of reported deaths — nearly 36,000 people — could have been been prevented had social distancing measures been put in place one week sooner. Trump has repeatedly defended his administration’s handling of the virus in the face of persistent criticism that he acted too slowly.”Columbia’s an institution that’s very liberal,” Trump told reporters Thursday. “I think it’s just a political hit job, you want to know the truth.”Trump has long been skeptical of mainstream science — dismissing human-made climate change as a “hoax,” suggesting that noise from wind turbines causes cancer and claiming that exercise can deplete a body’s finite amount of energy. It’s part of a larger skepticism of expertise and backlash against “elites” that has become increasingly popular among Trump’s conservative base.But undermining Americans’ trust in the integrity and objectivity of scientists is especially dangerous during a pandemic when the public is relying on its leaders to develop policies based on the best available information, said Larry Gostin, a Georgetown University law professor who is an expert in public health.“If the president is politicizing science, if he’s discounting health experts, then the public is going to be fearful and confused,” Gostin said, calling it “dismaying.”The White House rejected that thinking, noting that Trump has followed his administration’s public health officials’ recommendations through much of the crisis.“Any suggestion that the president does not value scientific data or the important work of scientists is patently false as evidenced by the many data-driven decision he has made to address the COVID-19 pandemic, including cutting off travel early from highly-infected populations, expediting vaccine development, issuing the 15-day and later 30-day guidance to ‘slow the spread,’ and providing governors with a clear, safe road map to opening up America again,” said White House spokesman Judd Deere.Yet Trump has made clear that, at least when it comes to hydroxychloroquine, he has prioritized anecdotal evidence, including a letter he told reporters he’d received from a doctor in Westchester, New York, claiming success with the drug.Asked this week what evidence he had that the drug was effective in preventing COVID-19, Trump responded: “Are you ready? Here’s my evidence: I get a lot of positive calls about it.”That veterans study, funded by grants from the NIH and the University of Virginia, was not a rigorous experiment, but a retrospective analysis by researchers at several universities looking at the impact of hydroxychloroquine in patients at veterans’ hospitals across the nation. It found no benefit and more deaths among those given hydroxychloroquine versus standard care alone. The work was posted online for researchers and has not been reviewed by other scientists.The Columbia study, in draft form, also hasn’t yet been published or reviewed by other experts. The researchers ran numbers through a mathematical model, making assumptions about how quickly the coronavirus spreads and how people behave in hypothetical circumstances.Trump’s criticism of the studies also comes as his allies have been eager to counter messaging from public health experts who say Trump is putting lives at risk by pushing states to quickly reopen in an election year. Republican political operatives have been recruiting pro-Trump doctors to go on television to advocate for reviving the U.S. economy as quickly as possible, without waiting to meet federal safety benchmarks.Gostin said Trump should leave it to his public health agencies to assess emerging data and the value of various studies.“I think there are real dangers,” he said, “for the president to play scientist and doctor on TV.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-enemy-statement-political-hit-job-how-us-president-targeted-scientists/story-MARzZbfTchAcixdv0zQXCM.html

22-05-2020||World||Nepal reports 30 new coronavirus cases; total infections at 487||Nepal reported 30 new coronavirus cases on Friday, taking the total number of infections in the country to 487. The coronavirus has so far claimed three lives in the country, which continues to impose a nation-wide lockdown to contain the spread of the virus. The Health and Population Ministry on Friday said another 21 COVID-19 patients had fully recovered and discharged from hospitals. The total number of coronavirus recovery cases stand at 70. Of the 30 new COVID-19 cases, nine were from Kapilvastu district -- eight men aged between 24 and 53 and an eight-year-old girl, the ministry said. Similarly, 14 men aged between 22 and 39 and an 18-year-old woman tested positive for coronavirus in Sarlahi district. A 73-year-old woman from Chitawan district tested COVID-19 positive. The rest of the new cases were from Nawalparasi district -- four males aged between 33 and 74 and a 15-year-old girl. The country-wide lockdown, imposed on March 24, will remain effective till June 2. Nepal has extended the suspension on all domestic and international flights till June 14. The surge in coronavirus cases has prompted the Nepal government to seal the Kathmandu Valley, imposing complete restriction on people entering the capital city. “At present 14 cases have been reported in Kathmandu. Those entering into the valley require a certificate of negative Rapid Diagnostic Test,” the official said. Till now, nearly 40,000 coronavirus tests have been conducted in the country. The coronavirus, which first emerged in China’s Wuhan city, has claimed 3,30,000 lives with over 5.1 million confirmed infections across the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-reports-30-new-coronavirus-cases-total-infections-at-487/story-viAosVYuiOVhq7XCdtaAnM.html
22-05-2020||World||Oxford’s coronavirus vaccine trial progressing ‘very well’, on to second phase now||The widely-followed trials for a coronavirus vaccine at the University of Oxford were described on Friday as progressing “very well”, with experts moving to the next phase after initiating the trial in April, when over 1000 immunisations of its candidate-vaccine were completed.The next phase involves enrolling up to 10,260 adults and children to assess the immune response to the vaccine in people of different ages, to find out if there is variation in how well the immune system responds in older people or children.Andrew Pollard, head of the Oxford Vaccine Group, said: “The clinical studies are progressing very well and we are now initiating studies to evaluate how well the vaccine induces immune responses in older adults, and to test whether it can provide protection in the wider population”.“We are very grateful to the huge support of the trial volunteers in helping test whether this new vaccine could protect humans against the pandemic coronavirus.”Initial results are expected by September. The phase III part of the study involves assessing how the vaccine works in a large number of people over the age of 18. This group will assess how well the vaccine works to prevent people from becoming infected and unwell with COVID-19.Sarah Gilbert, professor of vaccinology at the Jenner Institute, said: “The Covid-19 vaccine trial team have been working hard on assessing the safety and immunogenicity of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, and preparing to assess vaccine efficacy”.“We have had a lot of interest already from people over the age of 55 years who were not eligible to take part in the phase I study, and we will now be able to include older age groups to continue the vaccine assessment”.Adult participants in both the Phase II and Phase III groups will be randomised to receive one or two doses of either the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine or a licensed vaccine (MenACWY) that will be used as a ‘control’ for comparison.The experts said ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 is made from a virus (ChAdOx1), which is a weakened version of a common cold virus (adenovirus) that causes infections in chimpanzees, that has been genetically changed so that it is impossible for it to replicate in humans.The university has tied up with biopharma major AstraZeneca to produce the vaccine on a mass scale, if the results are successful.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oxford-s-coronavirus-vaccine-trial-progressing-very-well-on-to-second-phase-now/story-CBogCrbaO4Yy7mJMeHc6ZL.html
22-05-2020||World||Visitors to UK face 14-day quarantine, £1,000 fine||Anyone arriving in the United Kingdom – including British citizens – from early June will need to quarantine themselves for 14 days or pay £1,000 fine if they fail to do so, as part of plans to prevent another wave of coronavirus that have been criticised by the airline and tourism industries.Details of the quarantine plan are to be announced at the daily Downing Street briefing later on Friday, but cabinet minister Brandon Lewis said on Friday that travellers will be asked to fill in a form with contact information, and health officials will perform spot checks to ensure compliance.Visitors from Ireland and the Channel islands will be exempted, besides road hauliers and medical officials, under the plans to be announced by home secretary Priti Patel.Lewis told breakfast programmes on television: “We’re a country that welcomes people from all over the world. But it is appropriate that we say ‘if you’re coming to the United Kingdom, we need to protect your own health and the health of the people of the United Kingdom’.”“And the best way is to make sure that people go through that quarantine period to ensure they have no symptoms and are not able to add to the spread of the virus. For UK citizens coming back, they will be able to go home and quarantine at home but for visitors they will need to make arrangements for where they can do that quarantine for 14 days”.Airlines UK, the association of UK airlines, expressed “collective frustration” in a letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson: “An open-ended quarantine, with no set end date, will make an already critical situation for UK aviation, and all the businesses we support, even worse”.“People will simply choose not to travel to and from the UK, at the same time as economies in Europe and around the world begin opening up their borders and removing their own quarantines - making the UK aviation sector unable to compete”.“Grounding airlines indefinitely will further exacerbate an already devastating economic impact on UK aviation, prolonging the revenue crisis and delaying even further the start of a recovery for a sector that supports over 1.5 million UK jobs”, it said.As of Thursday, the cumulative UK-wide figures were 36,042 deaths and 250,098 cases. London, which has been a hotspot, registered some of the lowest number of new cases in recent days, prompting some easing of lockdown restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/visitors-to-uk-face-14-day-quarantine-1-000-fine/story-unY2rzZH7HVKczPB3gy7GP.html
22-05-2020||World||China abandons growth target, lowers defence budget rise for 2020 amid pandemic||China for the first time in decades will not have a GDP growth target for 2020 given the global economic uncertainties because of the Covid-19 pandemic, a government work report released by Premier Li Keqiang said Friday.Premier Li read out the report at the launch of the shortened annual National People’s Congress (NPC) – China’s rubber stamp parliament -- meeting in Beijing on Friday, pledging government support to help the outbreak-hit economy and setting out broad economic goals for the year.In a draft budget report submitted to the NPC, the government also set a 6.6 percent growth rate for its defence budget, lower than the 7.5 percent rise in 2019, an outlay that’s closely followed globally.The proposed defense budget stands at 1.268 trillion yuan ($178 billion), according to the draft budget.China’s defense budget for 2019 was 1.19 trillion yuan, up 7.5 percent from 2018.China has maintained single-digit growth in its annual defence budget since 2016.It was expected that China will increase its defence budget at a lower rate year-by-year because of the Covid-19 pandemic, which killed and sickened more than 87000 and battered the Chinese economy into contracting.The country’s economy shrank 6.8% in the first quarter of 2020 compared with a year earlier, as the novel coronavirus spread from the central Chinese city of Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, where it emerged late last year.“We have not set a specific target for economic growth this year. This is because our country will face some factors that are difficult to predict in its development, due to the great uncertainty regarding the Covid-19 pandemic and the world economic and trade environment,” Li was quoted as saying by official media while reading out the work report at the Great Hall of the People on Friday morning.According to the report, China is targeting a 2020 budget deficit of at least 3.6% of GDP, above last year’s 2.8%, and fixed the quota on local-government special bond issuance at 3.75 trillion yuan ($527 billion), up from 2.15 trillion yuan.China will also issue 1 trillion yuan in special treasury bonds for the first time this year.Local government bonds could be mainly used to fund infrastructure projects, while special treasury bonds could be used to support firms and regions hit by the coronavirus outbreak, for subsidies to spur consumption or for boosting the capital structure of small banks, analysts told news agency Reuters.The work report added that Chinese government has set a target of creating nine million new urban jobs, compared to 11 million last year, and a surveyed urban unemployment rate of around 6 percent, compared to 5.5 percent last year.“We must be clear that efforts to stabilise employment, ensure living standards, eliminate poverty, and prevent and defuse risks must be underpinned by economic growth; so ensuring stable economic performance is of crucial significance,” the work report said.“We need to pursue reform and opening up as a means to stabilise employment, ensure people’s well-being, stimulate consumption, energise the market, and achieve stable growth. We need to blaze a new path that enables us to respond effectively to shocks and sustain a positive growth cycle.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-abandons-growth-target-lowers-defence-budget-rise-for-2020-amid-pandemic/story-WrMO4ZxLxrMZ2KhYZqj0jN.html

22-05-2020||World||China explains to India, others why it needs to handcuff Hong Kong under new law||China has sent out demarches to India and other countries to explain its decision to enact a new law for Hong Kong, a controversial move that is expected to trigger fresh pro-democracy protests in the specially administered region (SAR).The law, which will ban sedition, secession and subversion of the central government in Beijing, was submitted to China’s legislature, National People’s Congress (NPC), for deliberation as it began its annual session on Friday.It is expected to become a law at the end the week-long session of the largely rubber-stamp NPC.Critics say that the new law will effectively end wide-ranging freedoms including the right to peaceful assembly and free speech that Hong Kong enjoys under the “one country, two systems” mechanism.The system gives the city a high-degree of autonomy other than in defence and foreign affairs.Aware of the of the criticism expected to follow the announcement, Beijing sent out urgent demarches to foreign embassies, including India, late on Thursday night, explaining the law and why it was needed.And, essentially, the note explained, countries should support the law to protect their “own legitimate interests” in Hong Kong.The notes were sent out to the embassies and consulates at the same time as an NPC spokesperson was making the announcement about it.The demarche pointed out that Beijing will not tolerate any external interference in Hong Kong.“Hong Kong is a Special Administrative Region of China. The legislation for upholding national security in the Hong Kong SAR is purely China’s internal affair. No foreign country may interfere in this matter,” it said.In brusque language, the statement said: “Your country maintains close economic and trade cooperation as well as people-to-people exchanges with Hong Kong. Hong Kong’s prosperity and long-term stability is in line with the common interests of the whole international community, including your country, as well as protection of your country’s legitimate interests in Hong Kong. We hope that your government will understand and support China’s relevant practices”.“Hong Kong has become a notable source of risk to China’s national security,” it said.The government’s note blamed “external forces” for the protests, which have wracked Hong Kong since June last year; at first, the student-led agitation were over an extradition bill before morphing into wider pro-democracy protests.“The opposition in Hong Kong have long colluded with external forces to carry out acts of secession, subversion, infiltration and destruction against the Chinese mainland. The turbulence over the amendment bill in Hong Kong last June has greatly undermined the SAR’s rule of law and stability and battered its economy and people’s livelihoods,” the note said.“These activities have not only caused enormous damage to the security of the SAR authorities and public order, mounted a serious challenge to the principle of “one country, two systems”, but also posed a grave threat to China’s national security, sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity. Hong Kong has become a notable source of risk to China’s national security,” the demarche added.For Beijing, the new law will be the way to finally override Article 23 of the Basic Law -- Hong Kong’s mini constitution – which calls on the local government to “enact laws on its own to prohibit any act of treason, secession, sedition, subversion against the Central People’s Government”.However, nearly 23 years after the former British colony was handed back to China in 1997, the law has never been passed.“‘Hong Kong independence’ elements, separatists and those organising and joining terrorist activities only form a tiny minority in Hong Kong. It is these people that must be published in accordance with law,” the note added.“By doing so, we can protect the vast majority of the Hong Kong people who abide by law. This meets the fundamental interests of Hong Kong society,” the note said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-explains-to-india-others-why-it-needs-to-handcuff-hong-kong-under-new-law/story-OBrBtnwx67hAfUlDXdmoUJ.html

Look forward to winning in Nov!” she said.Biden, 77, is the presumptive presidential nominee of the Democratic Party. He is set to be formally nominated by the Democratic National Convention in Wisconsin in August. Once nominated, Biden will vie for the White House against 73-year-old Donald Trump, the incumbent President who is seeking re-election in the November 3 poll.Biden and Sanders have named a diverse group of respected leaders and experts to Biden-Sanders unity task forces to explore possible policy initiatives in six areas covering: climate change, criminal justice reform, economy, education, health care, and immigration, a media statement said.The task forces will meet in advance of the Democratic National Convention to make recommendations to the DNC Platform Committee and to Biden directly, it said.Building upon the work of the Democratic campaigns to date, the ultimate goal of the unity task forces is to develop the most successful possible agenda for Democrats in 2020, it added.In a blog post, Prakash attributed her being named to the Climate Crisis Task Force to Senator Sanders.“I am grateful for Bernie Sanders believing in me, I trust his political leadership, and believe this is an opportunity for our movement to continue to advance our fight for a Green New Deal,” she said.“Our nomination on this task force shows Joe Biden and his campaign are beginning to take seriously that power and the significance of young people within the party if we want to defeat Trump this November,” Prakash said.“We cannot afford another four years of Donald Trump pushing us backward, and I believe in our movement’s ability to begin winning a Green New Deal under a President Biden,” she added.Meanwhile, according to a new Fox News poll on the presidential race, former vice president Biden leads incumbent President Trump by eight percentage points.The Republican-leaning Fox News in its latest presidential poll survey found that in the 2020 ballot test, Biden leads Trump by 48-40 per cent.“Biden’s eight-point advantage is outside the poll’s margin of error. However, given that 11 per cent are undecided or plan to vote for someone else, neither candidate hits 50 per cent support. The race could go either way,” Fox concluded.According to the poll, among voters who are extremely motivated about voting this fall, Biden has a 12-point advantage (53-41 per cent). More Biden supporters (69 per cent) than Trump supporters (63 per cent) feel extremely motivated to vote.Trump leads by seven points among men and by 30 among rural whites. He won both groups by larger margins in 2016 (11 and 37 points respectively). Biden leads by 20 points among women and 64 points among blacks, it said, adding that the survey of 1,207 registered voters nationwide was conducted between May 17 and 20 and has a 2.5 point margin of error.According to RealClearPolitics, which maintains an average of all major national polls, Biden leads Trump by 5.5 percentage points.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/six-prominent-indian-americans-named-to-biden-sanders-unity-task-forces/story-Yc0i0irsS2plgztHlkvuDL.html
22-05-2020||World||Covid-19: Canadian university designs biodegradable face masks||With no proven drug or vaccine yet to cure the coronavirus disease Covid-19, millions around the world are taking precautions such as wearing face masks, maintaining social distancing to protect themselves from getting infected. But the face masks that are being produced have to be discarded after some time.Now, a multi-disciplinary team at Canada’s University of British Columbia (UBC) has designed a green version of the medical grade face masks that can be composted and is biodegradable.One of the byproducts of the coronavirus crisis is that the masks in use now, usually non-reusable, are discarded and add to stress on the environment. The UBC team has attempted to counter this challenge while also making the first medical grade N95 mask that is entirely made in Canada using materials available in the country.The Canadian-Mask or Can-Mask is a product of research at the UBC’s BioProducts Institute. The mask frame uses locally available wood fibre from a variety of softwoods including pine, spruce and cedar. Two prototypes have been developed: One with the commercial N95 filter in front and another with a wood-based special filter.In a release issued by the University, Johan Foster, a chemical and biological engineering associate professor in the faculty of applied science, said, “With millions of disposable masks and gloves already polluting city sidewalks and potentially entering our rivers and oceans, we urgently need a biodegradable option to avoid making a massive impact on our environment.”The biodegradable face masks developed by UBS also strengthen the local supply chain as such masks were usually being imported and have been a scarce commodity following the outbreak across the world. Such shortage is another issue that is a focus of the project. As Foster said, “With escalating tensions during a pandemic, international supply lines for medical masks can break down, creating local shortages. When we decided to design a mask back in March, we knew early on we wanted a solution that uses local materials, is easy to produce and inexpensive, with the added bonus of being compostable and biodegradable.”The researchers are hopeful they will be able to apply for Health Canada certification soon after further testing of the masks to health industry specifications like fit and permeability. And then, these eco-friendly masks will go into cost-effective production.

22-05-2020||World||Calls for protest march in Hong Kong as China pushes new security laws||Hong Kong activists on Friday made online calls for a march against China’s plans to impose national security legislation on the semi-autonomous city which many fear could erode its freedoms and international standing as a global finance hub.While it was unclear whether the unauthorised march, proposed to start at noon near the central financial district and end at China’s Liaison Office, will materialise, it was a sign that Hong Kong could soon plunge into renewed unrest.A previous attempt to adopt similar legislation in 2003 was met with a protest that drew around half a million people onto the streets and was eventually shelved.China’s action comes after the large scale and often violent pro-democracy demonstrations in 2019, the biggest crisis the former British colony has faced since it returned to Chinese rule in 1997.Pro-democracy activists and politicians have for years opposed the idea of national security laws, arguing they could erode the city’s high degree of autonomy, guaranteed under the “one country, two systems” handover agreement, which China says it is undermined by protesters.Local pro-democracy lawmakers denounced the plans on Thursday night as “the end of Hong Kong”. The introduction of Hong Kong security laws on the agenda of the Chinese parliament, which begins its annual session on Friday after a months-long delay due to the coronavirus, drew a warning from US President Donald Trump that Washington would react “very strongly”.The US State Department also warned China, saying a high-degree of autonomy and respect for human rights were key to preserving the territory’s special status in US law, which has helped it maintain its position as a world financial centre. An editorial in the state-backed China Daily newspaper late on Thursday said the proposed legislation will “better safeguard Hong Kong’s development”.“The overreaction of those rioters and their foreign backers, who see such legislation as a thorn in their side, only testifies to the pertinence of the decision and the urgent need for such legislation,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/calls-for-protest-march-in-hong-kong-as-china-pushes-new-security-laws/story-72hVsHNssrEX3gmIiYUrXN.html

The figure, which was released at the start of the annual National People’s Congress session in Beijing, compares with a 7.5% increase last year.“China seems to have come out of the pandemic rather quickly and with far smaller consequences than others, but its economy will definitely take a hit,” said Nan Tian, a researcher in the Arms at Military Expenditure Program at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. “Some form of scaling back is inevitable.”The military spending figure is closely watched by US and regional policymakers as it represents one of the few pieces of official data available to gauge the development of the People’s Liberation Army. China was the second-largest military spender in the world in 2019, accounting for 14% of global military spending compared with 38% for the US, according to SIPRI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-china-s-defence-spending-grows-at-slowest-pace-since-at-least-1991/story-RdzfeWXDOnmKdE2idieCgO.html
22-05-2020||World||Covid-19: Two studies indicate reinfection may not happen||Two recently published studies hold promise over one of the most enduring questions since the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19): does a person who has recovered from the highly contagious disease develop immunity against reinfection? US researchers have indicated that the answer may be yes – a positive sign that vaccines being developed could succeed.The two studies in monkeys have offered some of the first scientific evidence that surviving Covid-19 may result in immunity from reinfection, the researchers said on Wednesday. Although scientists have assumed that antibodies produced in response to the new virus are protective, there has been scant scientifically rigorous evidence to back that up.How long the protection lasts, however, still remains unclear.In one of the new studies, researchers infected nine monkeys with Sars-CoV-2, which causes Covid-19. After they recovered, the team exposed them to the virus again and the animals did not get sick.The findings suggest that they “do develop natural immunity that protects against re-exposure”, said Dr Dan Barouch, a researcher at the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Harvard’s Beth Israel Deaconness Medical Center in Boston, whose studies were published in the journal Science. “It’s very good news,” Barouch said.Several research teams have released papers – many of them not reviewed by other scientists – suggesting that a vaccine against the virus would be effective in animals.In the second study, Barouch and colleagues tested 25 monkeys with six prototype vaccines to see if antibodies produced in response were protective. They then exposed these monkeys and 10 control animals to Sars-CoV-2. All of the control animals showed high degrees of virus in their noses and lungs, but in the vaccinated animals, “we saw a substantial degree of protection”, Barouch said. Eight of the vaccinated animals were completely protected. These studies, which have been peer reviewed, do not prove that humans develop immunity or how long it might last, but they are reassuring. “These data will be seen as a welcome scientific advance,” Barouch said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/two-studies-indicate-reinfection-may-not-happen/story-1Ht03z9oAKxBzYR4W5Fn7M.html
22-05-2020||World||‘Coronavirus came from China, US is not going to take it lightly’: Trump||The deadly coronavirus came from China and the US is not going to take it lightly, President Donald Trump said on Thursday. “It came from China. We are not happy about it. We just signed a trade deal, the ink wasn’t dry and all of the sudden this floated in. We are not going to take it lightly,” Trump said participating in a Listening Session with African-American Leaders in Michigan. Trump in the last several weeks has been very critical of China’s inability to control the spread of the novel coronavirus within its territory. By Thursday more than 94,000 Americans have died due to the coronavirus and over 1.6 million have tested positive. He has so far not given any indication of the steps that he is contemplating taking against China. Meanwhile, pressure is building on his administration, mainly from the Republican lawmakers on this. On Thursday, Senators Ted Cruz and Rick Scott, along Mike Braun, Marsha Blackburn, Joni Ernst, Martha McSally and Tom Cotton, introduced the COVID-19 Vaccine Protection Act to prevent the Chinese Communist Party from stealing or sabotaging American COVID-19 vaccine research. The bill requires a thorough national security evaluation and clearance by the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of State, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation of all Chinese student visa holders taking part in activities related to COVID-19 vaccine research. “The same Chinese Communist Party that covered up the coronavirus outbreak also routinely engages in state sponsored theft of intellectual property,” Cruz said. “We cannot allow China to steal or interfere with American research and development of a vaccine,” he added. “Communist China is responsible for the coronavirus pandemic, and their lies and misinformation cost American lives,” Scott said. “We cannot let Communist China off the hook for this, and we absolutely cannot allow Communist China to steal or sabotage any American research efforts related to the Coronavirus vaccine. The COVID-19 Vaccine Protection Act protects American efforts to create a vaccine as we work to end this pandemic,” he added. The COVID-19 Vaccine Protection Act, among others requires an enhanced vetting of nationals of the Chinese nationals in the US as nonimmigrants under F, J, or M student visas to determine if any student visa holders are a national security threat. Once the review is complete, authorizes Department of Homeland Secretary, in consultation with other agencies, to continuously monitor all non-immigrant student visa holders (F, M, J) who are Chinese nationals while in the US and are engaged in, or have access to, the research of any potential COVID-19 vaccine or COVID-19 related material. Republican Whip and Ranking Member of the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis Steve Scalise alleged that China lied to the world on coronavirus. “During a critical period in December and January, China withheld evidence of the virus: evidence that confirmed human to human transmission of the virus, evidence of the extent of the spread. China refused entry of American and other medical experts from around the world for weeks,” he said. “And during this time, China hoarded medical supplies like masks, gowns, and other life-saving PPE. Chinese exports of surgical masks, gowns, and gloves were stifled by the Chinese Communist Party during this period. China knew the danger posed by the virus and while they hid the truth, they used the time to stock up on vital medical supplies,” Scalise said. “While Chinese authorities limited domestic flights from Wuhan to other Chinese cities like Beijing and Shanghai, China’s government urged international carriers to maintain their flight schedules — seeding the virus throughout the rest of the world,” he alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-came-from-china-us-is-not-going-to-take-it-lightly-trump/story-tjnjIbGbpgV878cNeXO5IN.html

There was more bad news on the jobs front. On Thursday, the US labour department reported that more than 2.4 million workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, taking the total number of those laid off in the nine weeks of the lockdown to 38.6 million.Meanwhile, new infections and deaths dropped considerably, allowing all 50 states to reopen partially. The US is now staring at the 100,000-mark in number of deaths. It reported 1,518 deaths in the last 24 hours. The situation in New York City continued to improve, but governor Andrew Cuomo has said new cases are still being reported among lower income and minority communities. Of the 8,000 antibody tests conducted in those areas, the infection rate was at 34% in the Bronx, 29% in Brooklyn and 25% in Queens; which were way higher than the citywide average of 19.9%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-accuses-china-of-disinformation-attack/story-8OgaNEPg3f27tJw5ttMg9O.html

Despite the worrying spread of the disease, far-right President Jair Bolsonaro on Thursday continued his calls to scrap lockdown measures to revive the country’s flagging economy.But almost all of the country’s 27 states are under some sort of lockdown order, though Brazilians are wearying of the restrictions in place since the end of March.Sao Paulo state, the economic and cultural capital of Brazil, is by far the most affected area, with about a quarter of the country’s deaths and infections.The virus’s impact has accelerated in Rio de Janeiro state in recent days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-crosses-20-000-covid-19-deaths-after-record-24-hour-toll/story-9xQGo36mB1HYyMp9YzAktK.html
22-05-2020||World||Trump pulls US out of Open Skies treaty allowing surveillance flights||The United States said on Thursday it will withdraw from the 35-nation Open Skies treaty allowing unarmed surveillance flights over member countries, the Trump administration’s latest move to pull the country out of a major global treaty.The administration said Russia has repeatedly violated the pact’s terms. Senior officials said the pullout will formally take place in six months, but President Donald Trump held out the possibility that Russia could come into compliance.“I think we have a very good relationship with Russia. But Russia didn’t adhere to the treaty. So until they adhere, we will pull out,” Trump told reporters.His decision deepens doubts about whether Washington will seek to extend the 2010 New START accord, which imposes the last remaining limits on U.S. and Russian deployments of strategic nuclear arms to no more than 1,550 each. It expires in February.Trump has repeatedly called for China to join the United States and Russia in talks on an arms control accord to replace New START. China, estimated to have about 300 nuclear weapons, has repeatedly rejected Trump’s proposal.NATO allies and other countries like Ukraine had pressed Washington not to leave the Open Skies Treaty, whose unarmed overflights are aimed at bolstering confidence and providing members forewarning of surprise military attacks.In Moscow, RIA state news agency quoted Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko as saying that Russia has not violated the treaty and nothing prevents the continuation of talks on technical issues that Washington calls violations.The Open Skies decision followed a six-month review in which officials found multiple instances of Russian refusal to comply with the treaty. Last year, the administration pulled the United States out of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty with Russia.A senior administration said U.S. officials had begun talks in recent days with Russian officials about a new round of nuclear arms negotiations to “begin crafting the next generation of nuclear arms control measures.”Trump’s arms control negotiator mounted a full-blown defense of the administration’s arms control policies, focusing on the president’s proposal that China join the United States and Russia on a replacement for New START.“We know how to win these races and we know how to spend the adversary into oblivion. If we have to, we will, but we sure would like to avoid it,” Special Presidential Envoy for Arms Control Marshall Billingslea told the Hudson Institute think tank.The Open Skies treaty, proposed by U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower in 1955, was signed in 1992 and took effect in 2002. The idea is to let member nations make surveillance flights over each other’s countries to build trust.The officials cited a years-long effort by Russia to violate the terms, such as by restricting U.S. overflights of Russia’s neighbor Georgia and the Russian military enclave in Kaliningrad on the Baltic coast.In addition, they said Russia has been using its own overflights of American and European territory to identify critical U.S. infrastructure for potential attack in time of war.Some experts worry that a U.S. exit from the treaty, which will halt Russian overflights of the United States, could prompt Moscow’s withdrawal, which would end overflights of Russia by the remaining members, weakening European security at a time that Russian-backed separatists are holding parts of Ukraine and Georgia.Trump’s decision to leave the treaty is “premature and irresponsible,” said Daryl Kimball, head of the Washington-based Arms Control Association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-pulls-us-out-of-open-skies-treaty-allowing-surveillance-flights/story-b2VXyDp9rBbFra6a4Oo0jK.html
22-05-2020||World||Trump approval remains steady during pandemic||As the coronavirus pandemic stretches on, Americans’ views of the federal and state government response to the crisis are starting to sour — yet President Donald Trump’s personal approval rating has remained steady.A new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research shows that 41 per cent of Americans approve of the president’s job performance, while 58 per cent disapprove. That’s consistent with opinions of Trump before the pandemic, as well as throughout his more than three years in office.The survey highlights one of the remarkable features of Trump’s tenure as president: Despite a steady drumbeat of controversies, an impeachment trial and now a historic public health crisis, few Americans have changed their views of him. He’s failed to increase his support in any measurable way, yet he also has retained the approval of his core backers, including the overwhelming majority of Republicans.“The Trump presidency is a perfect example of the Rorschach test of politics,” said Alice Stewart, a Republican strategist who worked for Sen Ted Cruz’s 2016 presidential campaign. “People that want to see that the president is doing a good job will see that regardless of where the chips fall. If they want to see that he’s doing a crappy job, they will see that regardless of what happens.” Less than six months from his Election Day face-off against Democrat Joe Biden, the consistency of Trump’s support appears to leave him with the same narrow path to victory that first propelled him to the White House in 2016, even as the pandemic and resulting economic crisis upend nearly every aspect of American life.Biden’s campaign believes Trump’s uneven handling of the crisis will ultimately cost him his job in November.“The scale of the loss is staggering and it’s infuriating,” Biden said this week. “But more than that, it’s heartbreaking to think how much fear, how much loss, how much agony could have been avoided if the president hadn’t wasted so much time and taken responsibility.” The AP-NORC survey comes as the death toll in the US from COVID-19 nears 100,000 people. Robust testing remains a challenge, and a vaccine is months or years away. Yet the scope of the economic toll — nearly 40 million Americans have filed for unemployment since March — has also increased the urgency in many states to begin reopening businesses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-approval-remains-steady-during-pandemic/story-MmqBsIjyqoMxo0RpkuTEhP.html
22-05-2020||World||Amid rising tension, US Senate passes bill to delist Chinese firms from exchanges||The Senate overwhelmingly approved legislation Wednesday that could lead to Chinese companies such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Baidu Inc. being barred from listing on US stock exchanges amid increasingly tense relations between the world’s two largest economies.The bill, introduced by Senator John Kennedy, a Republican from Louisiana, and Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat from Maryland, was approved by unanimous consent and would require companies to certify that they are not under the control of a foreign government.US lawmakers have raised red flags over the billions of dollars flowing into some of China’s largest corporations, much of it from pension funds and college endowments in search of fat investment returns. Alarm has grown in particular that American money is bankrolling efforts by the country’s technology giants to develop leading positions in everything from artificial intelligence and autonomous driving to internet data collection.Shares in some of the biggest US-listed Chinese firms, including Baidu and Alibaba, slid Thursday in New York while the broader market gained.If a company can’t show that it is not under such control or the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or PCAOB, isn’t able to audit the company for three consecutive years to determine that it is not under the control of a foreign government, the company’s securities would be banned from the exchanges.“I do not want to get into a new Cold War,” Kennedy said on the Senate floor, adding that he wants “China to play by the rules.”“Publicly listed companies should all be held to the same standards, and this bill makes common sense changes to level the playing field and give investors the transparency they need to make informed decisions,” Van Hollen said in a statement. “I’m proud that we were able to pass it today with overwhelming bipartisan support, and I urge our House colleagues to act quickly.”House BillSince discussions on increased disclosure requirements began last year, many Chinese companies have either listed in Hong Kong already or plan to do so, said James Hull, a Beijing-based analyst and portfolio manager with Hullx.“All Chinese U.S.-listed entities are potentially impacted over the coming years,” he said. “Increased disclosure may hurt some smaller companies, but there’s been risk disclosures around PCAOB for a while now, so it shouldn’t be a shock to anyone.”In a sign of broad support for the measure, Representative Brad Sherman, a California Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, introduced a companion bill in that chamber. Sherman said in a statement that Nasdaq moved this week to delist China-based Luckin Coffee after executives at the company admitted fabricating $310 million in sales between April and December 2019.“I commend our Senate counterparts for moving to address this critical issue,” Sherman said. “Had this legislation already been signed into law, U.S. investors in Luckin Coffee likely would have avoided billions of dollars in losses.”House leaders are discussing the legislation -- and a separate Senate-passed bill to sanction Chinese officials over human rights abuses against Muslim minorities -- with lawmakers and members of the relevant committees, a Democratic aide said.The Senate measure -- S. 945 -- is an example of the rising bipartisan pushback against China in Congress that had been building over trade and other issues. It has been amplified especially by Republicans as President Donald Trump has sought to blame China as the main culprit in the coronavirus pandemic.GOP lawmakers have in recent weeks unleashed a torrent of legislation aimed at punishing China for not being more forthcoming with information or proactive in restricting travel as the coronavirus began to spread from the city of Wuhan, where it was first detected.Trump escalated his rhetoric against China on Wednesday night, suggesting that leader Xi Jinping is behind a “disinformation and propaganda attack on the United States and Europe.”“It all comes from the top,” Trump said in a series of tweets. He added that China was “desperate” to have former Vice President Joe Biden win the presidential race.Kennedy told Fox Business on Tuesday that the bill would apply to US exchanges such as Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange.“I would not turn my back on the Chinese Communist Party if they were two days dead,” Kennedy said. “They cheat. And I’ve got a bill to stop them from cheating.”At issue is China’s longstanding refusal to allow the PCAOB to examine audits of firms whose shares trade on the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and other U.S. platforms. The inspections by the little-known agency, which Congress stood up in 2002 in response to the massive Enron Corp. accounting scandal, are meant to prevent fraud and wrongdoing that could wipe out shareholders.ClashSince then China and the US have been at odds on the issue even as companies including Alibaba and Baidu have raised billions of dollars selling shares in American markets. The long-simmering feud came to the forefront last year as Washington and Beijing clashed over broader trade and economic issues, and some in the White House have been urging Trump to take a harder line on the audit inspections.Last week, Trump said in an interview on Fox Business that he’s “looking at” Chinese companies that trade on the NYSE and Nasdaq exchanges but do not follow US accounting rules. Still, he said that cracking down could backfire and simply result in the firms moving to exchanges in London or Hong Kong.While not technically part of the government, the PCAOB is overseen by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The ability to inspect audits of Chinese firms that list in the US is certain to come up at a roundtable that the SEC is holding July 9 on risks of investing in China and other emerging markets.Senators Kevin Cramer, Tom Cotton, Bob Menendez, Marco Rubio and Rick Scott are also sponsors of the bill. Rubio applauded the passage of the Kennedy-Van Hollen bill and said it incorporated aspects of a similar bill he introduced last year.“I was proud to work with Senator Kennedy on this important legislation that would protect American retail investors and pensioners from risky investments in fraudulent, opaque Chinese companies that are listed on U.S. exchanges and trade on over-the-counter markets,” Rubio said in a statement. “If Chinese companies want access to the U.S. capital markets, they must comply with American laws and regulations for financial transparency and accountability.”According to the SEC, 224 US-listed companies representing more than $1.8 trillion in combined market capitalization are located in countries where there are obstacles to PCAOB inspections of the kind this legislation mandates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-rising-tension-us-senate-passes-bill-to-delist-chinese-firms-from-exchanges/story-u11JHrX2XDKIZTTh9uZrEP.html

22-05-2020||India||Govt relaxes travel restrictions on OCI cardholders||New Delhi: The Centre on Friday relaxed travel restrictions to allow certain Overseas Citizens of India (OCI) cardholders, including children of Indian nationals living abroad, to come to the country, according to an order issued in this regard. The others allowed to travel include those wanting to come for family emergencies, students whose parents are Indian citizens living in India, and spouses of Indian nationals with permanent residence in the country. “The travel restrictions, imposed earlier by MHA [ministry of home affairs] on May 7 would not apply to any aircraft, ship, train or any other vehicle deployed for bringing back the... categories of OCI cardholders who are stranded abroad,” said a government press release.India in March first suspended almost all visas and visa-free travel privileges of OCI cardholders. The suspension was extended subsequently in April and May as part of measures to stave off the Covid-19 pandemic. India in late March imposed a lockdown to check the pandemic spread and suspended air, rail and road transport. India will resume domestic flights beginning May 25.Officials aware of the matter said OCI cardholders exempted from the travel restrictions are likely to be included in the third phase of the government’s expatriation programme, Vande Bharat Mission, for Indian citizens stranded abroad after June 13. They added if any seats are vacant on the flights being operated as part of the second phase of the mission, then OCI cardholders will be brought in as well. The second phase of the mission started on May 16 and is expected to bring back around 32,000 Indian citizens on over 160 flights from 47 countries.The government had last month indicated that the first priority was Indian nationals stranded abroad before requests from OCI cardholders to be allowed to travel to India could be taken up. Officials said only those categories with an immediate need to travel have been exempted among OCI cardholders for travel to India.According to the government data, around 200,000 Indian nationals have registered to return to the country and the government is prioritising travel of those with compelling reasons like people who have lost jobs overseas, pregnant women, and others with medical emergencies. There are over 3.4 million OCI cardholders, according to the external affairs ministry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-relaxes-travel-restrictions-on-oci-cardholders/story-KNm65NVUy8pWMzIOx17BxO.html
22-05-2020||India||MP battles with swarms of desert locusts heading towards Maharashtra||Swarms of desert locusts have reached districts of Madhya Pradesh close to Rajasthan border, travelling thousands of kilometers from west Asia through Pakistan looking for food, a sight not seen in the central Indian state since 1993, officials said on Wednesday, as the state has asked farmers to spray chemicals and play loud music to shoo away the unusual guests. The Madhya Pradesh agriculture department in consultation with the Locust Warning Organisation (LWO) has mobilised teams to drive away and kill these creatures as they settle on the trees in the night, officials said.The swarms of locusts started arriving in Madhya Pradesh from Neemuch-Rajasthan border since Sunday. As many as 16 districts of Madhya Pradesh, mostly in the Malwa region, have been affected so far, officials said, adding that they may be heading to Maharashtra as they have already reached Dhar, not far from the western state.Though Rabi season is over and there is no crop in the fields, the swarms have scared the vegetable growing farmers in Neemuch, Mandsaur, Ujjain, Dhar and other districts as they chase them away by beating drums, plates, tin cans etc.“..Whenever they spot trees, they settle over it and devour the vegetation. If there is any loss to vegetables farmers, they will get compensation from the revenue department as per the rules and procedure,” said Ajit Kesari, principal secretary, department of farmer welfare and agriculture.Explaining the modus operandi employed to get rid of the locusts, Kesari said that a team of government of India along with teams from the affected districts, were using water, noise and chemicals as weapons against the unwanted visitors.“The moment the locusts sit on trees, we either shoo them away with the help of noise or with water sprayed from fire tenders. Our second strategy is to spray a specific chemical over them around midnight, once they settle over trees. It kills some and the remaining fly. Then we repeat the process wherever they settle next,” he said.He added that the central government had released Rs 51 lakh for the purchase of the chemical being used to fight the locust menace.“We are keeping stock of chemicals in all the districts. Our instructions to all these districts are to track the locusts and spray the chemical over them when they settle at night. Thus, their number is decreasing by the day. Also, the area is chemically treated to destroy their eggs too,” said Kesari.Dr KL Gujar, deputy director, Locust Warning Organisation (LWO), Faridabad said the creatures were headed this way looking for greener and moist areas.“Given the swift westerly wind, swarms of desert locusts are covering a large area while flying high. The adult locusts can cover several hundred kilometres in the daytime. The breeding of the locusts took place in Pakistan, Baluchistan and Iran but right now, there is dry condition over there. That’s why these are heading towards greenery and moist areas. Direction of wind also helps them cover long distances.”Dr Gurjar said, “We can’t control them in the daytime. We try to control them when they settle at night. Given the size of the group, we are able to cover only 50 to 60% of them with all our resources. The remaining fly and some more join the swarm to make its size bigger. Besides, the existing resources, we are also trying to use drones. In the next couple of days we can get drones to target them on the trees itself while spraying chemicals.”He added that the locusts have arrived for the second consecutive year. This year they were chased in Rajasthan, MP, Gujarat and Punjab. Dr Gurjar said it was important to prevent them from breeding.“We have to stop their breeding. If we can’t control them in five days, they will be ready to breed posing a threat to the kharif crop. That’s why we have to kill them very fast.”(With input from Mustafa Husain in Neemuch and Monika Pandey in Jabalpur)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mp-battles-with-swarms-of-desert-locusts-heading-towards-maharashtra/story-SxEUoava3PxeuGxfzIUtYN.html
22-05-2020||India||Ravaged areas dread more damage with turn of tide||North and South 24-Parganas: Around 500 residents desperately tried to fix a 40-feet wide breach in an embankment along the Vidyadhari river at Uchildaha in West Bengal’s North 24-Parganas district amid a trail of destruction Cyclone Amphan has left behind after hitting India’s eastern coast on Wednesday. Only a few brick houses stood amid the damage that the most powerful cyclone to hit the region in over a decade caused. Residents said they were running out of time as the spring tide, which occurs twice each lunar month, was imminent and they feared further damage. “It is the time of the low tide and we have no time to waste. If we fail to repair the embankment by 8 pm, the spring tide scheduled tonight [Friday] will leave nothing in this village,” said Manas Mahato, the village head of Uchildaha, about 55km from Kolkata. The village was flooded on Wednesday because of the breach that damaged all fish ponds, the main source of income for the residents, and flattened mud houses.The cyclone and the four-metre high storm surge that it triggered breached embankments along major rivers at over 100 places across North 24-Parganas and South 24-Paraganas districts. Residents feared the spring tide may bring another wave of destruction for remote villages because of the breaches. Shibayan Paloi, a resident of Gobindorampur in South 24 Parganas, said the Friday night is most crucial. “It is the new moon and more water will gush in. We do not know what to do. We will have to go back to the school building with our children where we had taken shelter during the storm.”The new moon was scheduled on May 22 and scientists said that the spring tide phase, when average tidal ranges are higher, has started. “Embankments along rivers Ichhamoti, Bidyadhari, Dasha, Rayamangal and Bethni have been breached in most areas. The panchayats [village councils] are working to fix the breached embankments and more people were evacuated on Friday to avert further loss of human lives,” said Sukumar Mahato, the West Bengal assembly member from Sandeshkhali.Several remote islands in the Sunderbans region and coastal blocks still remained disconnected even on Friday as telecommunication services were yet to be restored. But there were reports of major breaches in embankments along the Matla and Raymangal rivers from areas like Patharpratima, Kultali, and Gosaba blocks in South 24 Parganas. Officials said Bidyadhari’s embankment at Minakhan breached at 11 places and hundreds of houses, fish ponds, and farmland were damaged. In the neighbouring Sandeshkhali, embankments were breached at 15 places.A North 24-Parganas district official said the evacuated people were initially kept in 350 relief centres. “Later, we created 100 more shelters to save people from the flooding through breached embankments and the prospect of the spring tide,” the official said on condition of anonymity. Several gram panchayat areas remained cut off as hundreds of uprooted trees, electric poles, and towers blocked important roads. Virtually no mud and brick houses with tin, asbestos or tiled roofs withstood the storm. Bridges and culverts were also damaged.Uchildaha-resident Hasan Sardar said everything in the village is lost. “The houses, crops, fish in ponds... there is no trace of a large number of cattle. The village will be washed away if we fail to repair the breached embankment before the spring tide arrives,” he said.Some were trying to repair the embankments, while others repaired their badly-damaged houses in Sarabaria, Muchikhola, Mallickbheri in Minakhan, and Haroa areas of North 24-Parganas. Many residents complained of drinking water shortage and said the food local authorities supplied was the only thing they had to eat.“Tiger prawns, lobsters... from all fish ponds have been washed away. Fishery sector alone is estimated to suffered losses worth Rs 100 crore in Minakhan,” said Mrityunjay Mondal, a leader of the ruling Trinamool Congress, who was supervising the relief work.The smell of rotting fish filled the air in Gobindarampur village in coastal South 24 Parganas, which is one of the worst-hit districts. Residents said that saline water gushed into the village on Wednesday, killing Rohu, Katla, and Pangash fish in ponds and also triggered a water crisis.“We use pond water for cooking purposes. The cattle used to drink this water. Now we have to depend on only one tube well in the entire village,” said Hiren Das, a Gobindarampur resident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ravaged-areas-dread-more-damage-with-turn-of-tide/story-AMa9sokUSU1BHQqSCjDT7K.html
22-05-2020||India||Andhra HC revokes suspension of former state intelligence chief, wants him reinstated||The Andhra Pradesh high court on Friday revoked the suspension of senior Indian Police Service (IPS) officer and former state intelligence chief A B Venkateshwar Rao and directed the state government to take him back into service.The high court delivered the judgement on a petition filed by the 1989-batch IPS officer of Director General of Police rank challenging his suspension by the Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy government on February 8 this year.The high court, which heard the arguments from the petitioner and the state advocate general, also set aside the order of the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) which upheld the suspension of Rao. It ruled that the IPS officer be paid full salary for the period of suspension.Rao was suspended for his alleged irregularities in procurement of security equipment from an Israeli company during the previous Telugu Desam Party regime. The government, which entrusted the case to Anti-Corruption Bureau, alleged that Rao had colluded with an Israeli defence equipment manufacturing firm RT Inflatables Pvt Ltd to illegally award critical intelligence and surveillance contract to his son Chetan Sai Krishna, who is the CEO of Akasam Advanced Systems Pvt Ltd.The government also alleged that Rao had willfully disclosed intelligence protocols and procedures of police to the foreign defence manufacturing firm, which was a direct threat to national security as intelligence protocols are standard throughout the Indian Police Force.Rao challenged his suspension by filing a petition in the Central Administrative Tribunal on February 13. He contended that the suspension was politically motivated and was done based on frivolous grounds. However, the CAT on March 17 upheld his suspension.On March 7, the Union Ministry of Home Affairs also approved the suspension of Venkateshwara Rao. And it was expended for a further period of three months on April 7.Rao, who was intelligence chief during the Chandrababu Naidu regime, was shifted from the post by the Election Commission of India following complaints from YSR Congress party leaders during the general elections in April 2019. He was later posted as DGP of the Anti-Corruption Bureau.However, after Jagan came to power in May 2019, Rao was attached to the headquarters without being given any posting.Meanwhile, hearing another petition, the high court found fault with the state government for going ahead with painting the buildings of gram panchayats with colours representing the ruling YSR Congress party, despite earlier orders given by both the high court and the Supreme Court.The high court also dismissed the state government order (GO Ms No. 623), adding terracotta colour to the YSRC party colours on the gram panchayat buildings, instead of removing them altogether.The high court sought to know why a contempt of court should not be filed against the government for defying its earlier orders. It sought an explanation from the state chief secretary and panchayat raj secretary by May 28 and asked the high court registrar to start the procedure for contempt of court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-hc-revokes-suspension-of-former-state-intelligence-chief-wants-him-reinstated/story-ZPWBqjsMy9LCNpGb5htwOI.html

While 75% of the expenditure during setting-up of community radio stations is borne by the ministry and that comprises a major expenditure, daily operations’ cost is borne by the stations. The minister pointed out that there would not be the need for community radio stations to seek funds if more local advertisements can be relayed on these platforms.Terming community radio stations as ‘agents of change’, Javadekar said they reached out to millions every day, and the I&B ministry will come out with a plan to increase their numbers.Exhorting people to keep up their fight against coronavirus, the minister said that “we will drive it away the way we have driven away other diseases”.However, he highlighted the new normal - one that consists of 4 steps - staying at home as much as possible, frequent washing of hands, wearing face masks in public and social distancing.The minister reiterated the mantra of “Jaan Bhi Jahaan Bhi” and said that while restrictions are continuing in the containment zones, economic activities are starting up in green zones.The minister also touched upon the key demand of community radio of permission to broadcast news. He assured that he will consider allowing news broadcast on community radio the same way it is done on FM channels.Community radio stations work in an area of 10-15 kilometers and cater to the local audiences. Many such channels are operating in the interior and remote parts of the country.He prodded such stations to play a key role in combating fake news menace. He added that the ministry has created a fact check cell under PIB and the community Radio can complement the role of fact check cell.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/community-radio-stations-may-soon-get-to-air-12-minutes-of-ads-per-hour-says-i-b-minister/story-afTrFEISNuQcDpdJOYbJSL.html

Advisor to the US president, Ivanka shared an article by HT’s sister publication livemint.com and hailed the Bihar girl.“15 yr old Jyoti Kumari, carried her wounded father to their home village on the back of her bicycle covering +1,200 km over 7 days. This beautiful feat of endurance & love has captured the imagination of the Indian people and the cycling federation,” Ivanka tweeted. 15 yr old Jyoti Kumari, carried her wounded father to their home village on the back of her bicycle covering +1,200 km over 7 days. This beautiful feat of endurance & love has captured the imagination of the Indian people and the cycling federation!🇮🇳 https://t.co/uOgXkHzBPzThe cycling federation will invite Jyoti Kumari, 15, to appear for a trial next month, impressed with the doggedness with which she pedalled her way to Bihar from Gurugram, carrying her ailing father.With her father Mohan Paswan riding pillion, Jyoti cycled for seven days, covering 1,200 km to get to Bihar’s Darbhanga.Presently, the father-daughter duo is at a quarantine centre near their village Sirhulli under Singhwara block of the district.Paswan, driven to penury following an accident a few months ago,said his landlord gave him an ultimatum to either pay the rent that was due for a few months, or leave.“I succeeded in buying time on a couple of occasions. I promised him that I would take up whatever job I could land once the lockdown was lifted, earn money and pay all his dues. We were so hard pressed that I had to discontinue my medicines so that we could afford one square meal a day. How could we have arranged money for rent?” PTI quoted him as saying.As the lockdown kept getting extended, the threats of the landlord kept getting more severe, he said.It was then that Jyoti was looking after her father in Gurugram while her mother was taking care of her four younger siblings back in the village while working as an Aanganwadi worker.“Amid the gloomy situation, Jyoti suggested that we return home. I pointed out that we would not be able to find any trains or buses soon and my condition would not allow me to walk. She said we should get a bicycle,” said Paswan.Despite attempts to dissuade the daughter, the duo was soon on the road. The father smiled with a hint of pride when asked about her daughter being compared in the local media to the character of Shravan Kumar from the epic Ramayana, who took his old and frail parents on a long pilgrimage with his mother and father seated in baskets hanging at the ends of a pole he carried on his shoulders.“She is indeed my Shravan Kumar. The journey back home has been nothing short of a pilgrimage. Having arrived feels like salvation,” Paswan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/beautiful-feat-ivanka-trump-on-bihar-girl-cycling-1-200-km-with-father/story-dlyqoqgl58RCnBw26cH09L.html

22-05-2020||India||Covid-19 latest: 42 new cases set record for single-day spike in Kerala||Kerala reported a big spike with 42 new coronavirus cases on Friday, the highest in a day since the outbreak in January last, largely due to the continued repatriation of expats from the middle-eastern countries and return of residents stranded in other parts of the country. “More people are expected in the coming days. We can’t say no to our people. Situation is really critical but there is no need to panic either. What we need is more vigil and surveillance. We will do everything possible to avoid secondary infections,” said Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, adding that more than 90,000 people have arrived in the state by rail, road and air in the last two weeks.Out of total 732 coronavirus cases registered in the state so far, 216 are active- a sharp increase from 16 active cases about two weeks ago. The number of people under observation has also gone up to 85,000 from 5,000 at one stage.Out of 42 new cases registered on Friday, 21 are patients who arrived here from other states and 17 are foreign returnees, the CM said. North Kerala districts of Kannur and Malappuram have maximum active cases-- 36 each.The state has recorded five deaths to the disease so far; the last casualty was a woman who had returned from Mumbai two days ago.The pressure to contain the spread of the disease is only going to go up after more people arrive on domestic flights that are resuming on May 25. The CM said the state will insist on a 14-day mandatory quarantine for residents arriving on domestic flights.Union Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri had recently said that there was no need to put domestic travelers in quarantine.“We can’t take chances. It (quarantine) is not meant for business travelers and others who come for brief visits. But people who are coming here to stay will have to undergo a 14-day home quarantine like those coming by train,” he said.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19Vijayan said the government will take strict action against those who flout quarantine norms and cited that 100 cases were registered against such violators in the last two days. He also noted that many aged people and children were venturing out of homes after increased relaxation.“It is not a healthy trend. The government has made it clear that people who crossed 65 years of age and children below 10 years of age can come out only in urgent situations. But this is being flouted quite often,” he said adding that reverse quarantine is a must in such situations.Reverse quarantine refers to the practice of isolating a set of people including those with underlying medical conditions, those aged 65 years and above and the immune-compromised, so that they are protected against infections. The state has started experimenting with it in some districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-latest-42-new-cases-set-record-for-single-day-spike-in-kerala/story-BXGA6YWpz0S6TQ0P0RtXpK.html

The two Taliban leaders along with Mullah Nooruddin Turabi, who was earlier based in Doha, are reported to be treated at hospitals in Quetta and Karachi.Taliban leaders denied that some among its top leadership were down with Covid-19. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah said that the leaders of Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, as the political wing of the Taliban is termed, were healthy and not unwell. “Some outlets are circulating fake reports about a number of leaders of IEA including Deputy Khalifa Sahib Sirajuddin Haqqani contracting coronavirus…. The said reports are the work of malicious circles trying to stoke fear,” he tweeted.Counter-terror operatives, however, insisted that they had checked the information from multiple sources.The coronavirus infection, one official said, could be the reason why Fazal Mazloom was not spotted at the Taliban meetings at Doha earlier this month.He, however, stressed that there was no confirmation available how the Taliban leaders had contracted the infection. Or if it had anything to do with their visits to Pakistan over the last two months.A large proportion of Taliban leaders such as Sirajuddin Haqqani are known to be close to Pakistan deep state that has guided and funded them apart from allowing use of its facilities. Sirajuddin Haqqani also heads the terror group Haqqani Network that he inherited from his father Jalaluddin Haqqani who set it up during the Afghan-Soviet war.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/taliban-s-sirajuddin-haqqani-admitted-to-pak-military-hospital-for-covid-19-intel/story-tXXkPlyrZHmnK0129M0ZLP.html

22-05-2020||India||Hydroxychloroquine led to higher mortality and heart issues in Covid-19 patients, says a Lancet study||According to a paper published in the medical journal Lancet which analysed data of over 96,000 Covid-19 patients sourced from 671 hospitals across six continents over a span of almost four months, the benefits of administering hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine when used alone or in combination with a macrolide, to a Covid-19 positive patient are unconfirmed. In fact, the findings demonstrate that these drug regimens were associated with higher mortality rate or decreased in-hospital survival and an increased frequency of irregular heart rhythm or arrhythmia (ventricular arrhythmias) when used for treatment of Covid-19.The findings come from one of the largest analyses of the risks and benefits associated with treating coronavirus patients with the above mentioned anti-malarial drugs. It is based on a retrospective analysis of medical records and is not a controlled study.The paper co-authored by Mandeep R Mehra, Sapan S Desai, Frank Ruschitzka and Amit N Patel points out that chloroquine is an antimalarial drug while hydroxychloroquine, is used for the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. These drugs have shown to have antiviral properties as well as immunomodulatory effects in laboratory conditions and were thus being repurposed as therapeutic agents in the absence of an effective treatment against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, better known as SARS-CoV-2 infection.“However, the use of this class of drugs for COVID-19 is based on a small number of anecdotal experiences that have shown variable responses in uncontrolled observational analyses, and small, open-label, randomised trials, that have largely been inconclusive,” says the paper.It says that one of the several protocols developed for Covid-19 treatment, also advocates the use of a combination of hydroxychloroquine with a second-generation macrolide, such as azithromycin (or clarithromycin).The paper, however, deduces from “in-hospital outcomes” that these drugs either administered alone or in combination with macrolides have shown a higher mortality rate and increased heart problems for the researched group.The research paper assumes significance since antimalarial drugs are being experimented with for the treatment of coronavirus cases in several countries including the United States, which has shown even greater reliance on these drugs to treat positive cases. In India, ICMR has not allowed use of these drugs for coronavirus treatment on a ‘sympathetic’ basis. While US President Donald Trump had personally intervened and requested India for lifting the ban on export of hydroxychloroquine, India has warned against the indiscriminate use of this medicine among Covid-19 patients and suspects.The multinational registry analysis comprised data of patients hospitalised between Dec 20, 2019, and April 14, 2020, with a positive laboratory finding for SARS-CoV-2. It included patients in four treatment groups—chloroquine alone, chloroquine with a macrolide, hydroxychloroquine alone, or hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide. All these patients had received one of the four treatments within 48 hours of diagnosis of the disease.Another group—a control group—comprised of hospitalized coronavirus patients who had not been given any of the four treatments under study, was formed.The research studied the in-hospital mortality and the occurrence of de-novo ventricular arrhythmias among the groups formed.The 96 032 studied patients had a mean age of 53·8 years and 46·3% of those were women. Of these, 14 888 patients were in the treatment groups—1,868 received chloroquine, 3,783 received chloroquine with a macrolide, 3,016 received hydroxychloroquine, and 6,221 received hydroxychloroquine with a macrolideand 81, 144 patients were in the control group.The study found that 10, 698 or 11·1% patients died in the hospital. The mortality in the control group was 9·3%, but for the group administered with hydroxychloroquine, it was 18·0% (hazard ratio 1·335, 95% CI 1·223–1·457), for the group given hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide, it was 23·8% (hazard ratio 1·447, 1·368–1·531), for the group given chloroquine, it was 16·4% (hazard ratio 1·365, 1·218–1·531), and for group that was administered chloroquine with a macrolide, it was 22·2% (hazard ratio 1·368, 1·273–1·469).Each of these four groups were independently associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality, found the study.The occurrence of de-novo ventricular arrhythmia was also higher among the four groups administered with the drugs of interest, compared to the control group.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19“Compared with the control group (0·3%), hydroxychloroquine (6·1%; 2·369, 1·935–2·900), hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide (8·1%; 5·106, 4·106–5·983), chloroquine (4·3%; 3·561, 2·760–4·596), and chloroquine with a macrolide (6·5%; 4·011, 3·344–4·812) were independently associated with an increased risk of de-novo ventricular arrhythmia during hospitalization,” the study said.The study claims that the analysis was arrived at after controlling for multiple confounding factors including age, sex, race or ethnicity, body-mass index, underlying cardiovascular disease and its risk factors, diabetes, underlying lung disease, smoking, immunosuppressed condition, and baseline disease severity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hydroxychloroquine-led-to-higher-mortality-and-heart-issues-in-coved-19-patients-says-a-lancet-study/story-Bp17MvEzhIECYLkHE0T32L.html

Cyclone Amphan has left dozens of people dead and thousands homeless in West Bengal, battering several parts of the state and washing away bridges and swamping low-lying areas. It also wreaked havoc in Odisha, damaging power and telecom infrastructure in several coastal districts. In a circular, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (Irdai) said there are reports of loss of human lives and loss of belongings in the cyclone affected districts, primarily in the states of West Bengal and Odisha. In order to extend every possible facilitation in quick and timely settlement of life insurance claims, it asked insurers to nominate a senior officer to act as a nodal officer in the state concerned to liaise with the state administration to facilitate identification of policyholders among the deceased due to cyclone. “Initiate immediate action to ensure that all reported claims are registered and eligible claims are settled expeditiously,” Irdai said. With regard to claims involving loss of life, where difficulty is experienced in obtaining a death certificate due to non-recovery of body, it asked the insurers to follow the process as in the case of Chennai floods in 2015. “A suitably simplified process/procedure including relaxations in the usual requirements wherever feasible may be considered to expedite claims settlement,” the circular said. With a view to limit the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic and limiting direct/indirect social contact, insurers have been advised to encourage and motivate their policyholders/claimants to adopt e-modes, wherever possible for correspondence. In case policyholders/claimants reach office, life insurers should follow the government directions regarding maintaining social distancing and proper sanitisation, Irdai said. The staff must be duly sensitized to deal with policyholders/claimants with empathy and concern, it added. The insurance companies have also been asked to file state-wise progress report on claims settled on weekly basis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cyclone-amphan-irdai-asks-life-insurers-to-expeditiously-settle-claims/story-3yI1gmFkwTdknjoKlOMw0H.html

There were 99 passengers on board, however, it is not clear about the number of survivors.The Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) Karachi-bound flight from Lahore crashed in a residential area minutes before landing near the Jinnah International Airport. “Deeply saddened by the loss of life due to a plane crash in Pakistan. Our condolences to the families of the deceased, and wishing speedy recovery to those injured,” he tweeted. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi too condoled the loss of lives in the crash and said he is praying for “miraculous stories of survival”.“I’m sorry to hear about the air crash in Pakistan in which many lives have been lost. News of survivors is a ray of hope & I pray that there are many miraculous stories of survival tonight. My deepest condolences to the families of those who have perished,” tweeted the Congress leader.There were no immediate reports on the number of casualties. However, Karachi mayor said that there were no survivors, according to news agency Associated Press. Several people on social media contradicted his claims. Moments before the crash, pilot Sajjad Gul had informed air traffic controllers that he had lost an engine, according to audio tapes of his last conversation played by news channel ARY.“We have lost an engine…. Mayday, Mayday, Mayday,” the pilot is heard calmly telling the traffic controllers who told him to land on any of the two runways that had been left open for him.Communication between the ATC and the plane was lost soon after the pilot went for a go-around, said PIA chief executive officer Air Vice Marshal Arshad Malik. This is the second time in less than four years that a PIA plane has crashed. The airline’s chairman resigned in late 2016, less than a week after the crash of an ATR-42 aircraft killed 47 people, news agency Bloomberg reported.

22-05-2020||India||Covid-19 cases to peak in country between June 21-28: Study||India may witness Covid-19 cases peaking between June 21 and 28 with maximum daily positive cases to be around 7,000-7,500 in this period, a study by a team of researchers said.The study has predicted that confirmed Covid-19 cases reported daily will show a rising graph till the end of June.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“A clear downward trend in the confirmed cases is likely to be observed each day from the second week of July,” Nandadulal Bairagi, a senior professor of Jadavpur University who was involved in the project told PTI.With measures in place and increased testing, a gradual flattening of the trajectory is expected within October, the researcher said.The study was conducted by Bairagi, Professor and Coordinator Centre for Mathematical Biology and Ecology (CMBE), Jadavpur University, and five other researchers.The study, based on a mathematical model approved by the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) of the Government of India, used deep machine learning algorithms along with a mathematical model for analysing and forecasting the Covid-19 pandemic in India with data being taken from the https://www.covid19india.org/state website.“We divided the population of a designated geographical area into seven compartments based on the epidemiological class of Covid-19 and WHO prescribed minimum requirements of infection prevention and control (IPC) strategy to reduce transmission,” he said.Bairagi said, the total number of infected persons since the outbreak of coronavirus in the country “will touch the five lakh figure in first week of October and it will then start showing a perceptible declining trend.” One of the factors for this high number could be a large number of asymptomatic persons roaming around with each having the potential to transmit the infection to two-three more persons “Just think of it. The contamination was contained after 76 days of lockdown in Wuhan, the origin point of the coronavirus pandemic. But we in India are witnessing a spike in active cases despite the lockdown nearing two months in few days time,” he said.In the absence of any specific drug and vaccine, India must continue its nationwide lockdown to prevent person-to-person transmission of coronavirus while looking for ways to start economic activities, the senior researcher said.“Public transport must be avoided due to difficulties in contact tracing, random testing has to be increased and time for diagnosis has to be reduced for early detection... We have recommended to the government that lockdown may be partially withdrawn in green and orange zones after the last week of June, but it must be continued in red-zone regions of the states concerned. Strict surveillance must be continued after partial withdrawal of lockdown to avoid the second wave of Covid-19,” he said.Asked about their observation on difficulty in contact tracing in case of contamination in public transport, he explained, “In a hospital or similar place where the persons who have contacted the infection can be traced, you can trace the origin and quarantine every body else who came in touch with the primary contact.” But in a bus or train, there can be many asymptomatic persons who will spread the infection and then get down at their stoppages, he said.Apart from Bairagi, CMBE researcher Abhijit Majumder, Dr. Debadatta Adak of MBB University, Agartala, Dr. Tapas Kumar Bala of Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Kusumdevi Sundarlal Dugar Jain Dental College and Hospital, Dr Abhijit Paul and Dr Samrat Chatterjee of Translational Health Science and Technology Institute, Faridabad were involved in the research.The interim report of the research has already been sent to the SERB, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-cases-to-peak-in-country-between-june-21-28-study/story-CtEhBRYDvSFehkrePj7z8M.html

22-05-2020||India||Andhra HC orders CBI probe in Vizag doctor’s manhandling by cops||The Andhra Pradesh high court (HC) on Friday ordered an investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into the alleged inhuman treatment meted out to a Dalit doctor Dr. K Sudhakar by a section of Visakhapatnam Police personnel on May 16.The court, which took up the case suo motu (on its own), ordered that CBI register a criminal case against the police, who allegedly physically assaulted Sudhakar and tied his hands behind his back before bundling him into an auto-rickshaw to take him to the police station for creating nuisance in public and abusing the Andhra Pradesh government in a drunken state.The court asked CBI to complete the investigation within eight weeks and submit a comprehensive report.The court had taken into consideration a report submitted by a Visakhapatnam district judge stating that there were six injuries on Sudhakar’s body. It observed that there was no mention of the injuries in the report submitted by the police authorities.Sudhakar, an anaesthetist, is undergoing treatment for acute and transient psychosis at a government-run hospital for mental health in Visakhapatnam.The police have filed a case against Sudhakar under sections 353 (assault or use of criminal force to deter a public servant from discharging his duty) and 427 (mischief causing damage) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).In April, Sudhakar, who works at a government-run hospital at Narsipatnam, was suspended for courting the media to complain against the state government for not providing enough personal protective equipment (PPE) kits to frontline workers battling the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) epidemic.The Indian Medical Association (IMA) authorities have taken a serious note of the police brutality on the doctor and have written to Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy demanding action be taken against errant police personnel.IMA president Dr. Rajan Sharma has assured that the doctor would be made to apologise for his abusive language.Sudhakar’s mother Kaveri Bai expressed happiness over the HC judgement and hoped that justice would be meted out to his son. Main opposition Telugu Desam Party’s (TDP) women’s wing president V Anita echoed the doctor’s mother.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-hc-orders-cbi-probe-in-vizag-doctor-s-manhandling-by-cops/story-q7TRBZ6zVC3t17kydD910K.html
22-05-2020||India||Covid relief to artisans making idols for Ganeshotsav, PoP ban deferred for a year||The union environment ministry on Friday withdrew its proposed ban on the use of Plaster of Paris (PoP) for making idols in 2020 Environment minister Prakash Javadekar said that the decision to postpone the ban by one year was taken to help artisans but environmentalists criticised the government, saying that PoP was harmful to the environment.“The ban on PoP for the Ganesh idol has been postponed for one year. This will not harm those artisans who have already made their idols this year,” Javadekar tweeted on Friday.On May 13, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) published guidelines on banning the use of PoP, thermocol, and single-use plastic for making idols across India while encouraging the use of biodegradable and less toxic materials. Even dyes and toxic chemicals used to colour the idols were proposed to be banned for future use.“Based on submissions from various parts of the country about different festivals, especially Maharashtra, where idol makers have already purchased large quantities of PoP, we have lifted the ban just for this year. Considering the Covid-19 crisis and difficult economic situation, the decision was taken. Idol makers are directed to avoid the use of chemicals and dyes as much as possible this year,” said a senior official from the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change. “This is a temporary decision, and the ban will be implemented from 2021.”Made from Gypsum, which is heated up to 150 degrees Celsius, PoP contains chemicals such as sulphur, phosphorus and magnesium. It is also used for making casts for broken bones. It costs the cheapest (Rs. 500 to 1000 for a small household idol) among all materials, but it remains in the environment for a long time, with potential harm to aquatic life.The umbrella body of Ganesh mandals in the city, Brihanmumbai Sarvajanik Ganeshotsav Samanvay Samiti (BSGSS), had requested the Maharashtra government and the Centre to allow the use of plaster of Paris (PoP) during this year’s festival. “Acquiring large quantities of clay, which is very expensive, will be very difficult during lockdown for artisans. We welcome the Centre’s decision to ensure idol makers are not harmed during this tough period. We have directed mandals to celebrate a simple festival this year,” said Naresh Dahibhavkar, president, BSGSS.This year 2.32 lakh large and household idols are slated to be made in Mumbai, Dahibhavkar said. “Of this 15% will be eco-friendly, made from clay and paper, while the remaining will be made up of PoP. About 10% of 2.32 lakh idols have already been made,” said Dahibhavkar.Marine biologists said PoP was never the choice for idol makers historically. “It has always been clay (shadu) idols not only for Ganeshotsav but other festivals as well. PoP takes months to break down and dissolve, destroying the marine ecosystem and considering the Covid-19 pandemic, it is our duty to be more sensitive to the environment. Lifting the ban is a bad idea,” said Vinay Deshmukh, marine biologist and former scientist, Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI).Environmentalists pointed out that the CPCB had revised its guidelines after 10 years based on an order passed by the Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court (HC) discouraging the use of PoP. “The Centre does not have the authority to override the HC’s decision, which was in the interest of the environment. Historically, the size of the idol (during Lokmanya Tilak’s time when the festival was first celebrated in the current form) was not more than nine inches. The priority of the ministry should be the opposite of the decisions it is currently taking,” said Anand Pendharkar, wildlife biologist, Sprouts Environment Trust.Use of PoP In Mumbai during GaneshotsavAn average of 11,000 large (for public places) idols and 1.6 lakh household idols are made every year using PoP. The use of thermocol and plastic was disallowed by the umbrella body of Ganesh mandals last year. An average of 75 large idols and 40,000 household idols are made using clay while 250 paper idols are made annually during the 11-day Ganeshotsav festival. Lalbaugcha Raja, Mumbai Cha Raja Ganesh Galli, Andhericharaja, Fortcha Icchapurti and many other popular idols have been using PoP annually for almost a decade. Last year 2.11 lakh idols were immersed across 129 immersion spots in Mumbai. The figure was 2.03 lakh in 2018, 1.92 lakh in 2017, and 2.09 lakh in 2016. The percentage of eco-friendly idols increase from 2% to 5% over four years with a maximum increase in paper idols being adopted by mandals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-relief-to-artisans-making-idols-for-ganeshotsav-pop-ban-deferred-for-a-year/story-fGwFozShhnn9qSDSJjjb7O.html
22-05-2020||India||MHA allows OCI cardholders in certain categories to come back to India||The Central government on Friday relaxed visa and travel restrictions for holders of Overseas Citizens of India (OCI) cards stranded abroad since March due to the Covid-19 lockdown, allowing certain categories to come to India. The categories include minor children born to Indian nationals abroad who hold OCI cards, those wishing to travel for family emergencies, and university students who are OCI card holders but whose parents are Indian citizens living in India.The OCI card holders are likely to be included in the third phase of the government’s massive repatriation operation called Vande Bharat Mission, as there is no word yet on when the government will allow international flights. Officials familiar with developments said OCI card holders could also be accommodated in vacant seats in flights during the second phase of Vande Bharat Mission, which will continue till June 13.In the second phase, which started on May 16, India is bringing back around 32,000 citizens on more than 160 flights from 47 countries.The home ministry’s order on Friday partially resolves issues raised by hundreds of thousands of people whose visas were suspended following the imposition of restrictions on international travel because of the Coronavirus outbreak.The categories of OCI card holders allowed by the government include minor children born to Indian nationals abroad holding OCI cards, OCI card holders who wish to come to India on account of family emergencies such as a death in the family, couples where one spouse is an OCI card holder and the other is an Indian national and they have permanent residence in India, and university students who are OCI card holders (not legally minors) but whose parents are Indian citizens living in India, according to the home ministry’s order seen by HT. With this move, the multiple-entry lifelong visas given to OCI card holder have also been restored after they were temporarily suspended due to the Covid-19-related restrictions.OCI card holders were among several categories of people who have been eagerly awaiting permission to travel to India. Government officials had indicated earlier this month that their first priority is meeting the minimum expectations of Indian nationals stranded abroad before requests from OCI card holders could be entertained. In line with this thinking, only those categories with an immediate need to travel have been picked now from among OCI card holders.According to government data, nearly 260,000 Indian nationals in 98 countries have registered with the external affairs ministry to return to the country, and the government is prioritising travel of those with compelling reasons, such as people who have lost their jobs, pregnant women and people with medical emergencies.“The travel restrictions, imposed earlier by MHA on May 7 would not apply to any aircraft, ship, train or any other vehicle deployed for bringing back the above mentioned categories of OCI card holders who are stranded abroad,” said a statement from the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mha-allows-oci-cardholders-in-certain-categories-to-come-back-to-india/story-8MFwLuOIeSiJnDiSeaVAiJ.html
22-05-2020||India||Refrain from using Covid-19 crisis for personal political gains: Opposition parties to Centre||Leaders of 22 opposition parties on Friday decided to submit to a 10-point charter of demands to the Centre, urging it to refrain from using the Covid-19 crisis for personal political gains, activate parliamentary institutions such as standing committees and provide financial help to states.The meeting, chaired by Congress president Sonia Gandhi, also appealed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to immediately reach out to all the political parties in a systematic manner, engage them in a dialogue with listen seriously to their suggestions to deal with the health and economic crisis triggered by the deadly coronavirus.Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar said the like-minded parties believe that this is neither the time for showmanship nor the one-upmanship. “This is the time for a collective endeavour to bring India out of this crisis. This is what the people of India need and this is what the people of India demand,” he added.Pawar said the opposition parties are collectively going to raise a ten- point demand to the Centre for immediate implementation.“Refrain from using the crisis for personal political gain, activate parliamentary institutions like standing committees and be genuine in helping the states financially and otherwise,” he said.Pawar stressed the need to take the right steps to gradually restore road transport within the states and plan for resumption of air and rail services that were disrupted by the lockdown.“New policies for encouraging industrial growth should be incorporated to attract new investment in the states. To increase imports, exports and inland shipping, consultations should be held with industrialists, entrepreneurs and expert officials in the field,” he added.“The number of students will decline for the next academic year due to the lockdown. Some educational institutions are likely to collapse or close down due to financial losses. A study group or committee should be appointed to take timely measures,” the former union minister said.Pawar said the state governments are relaxing the conditions of lockdown but factories are not in a position to resume as workers have migrated to the villages.“We need to strategise to bring them back,” he said.Earlier, the opposition parties urged the Centre to immediately declare the devastation caused by Cyclone Amphan in Odisha and West Bengal as a national calamity and called for substantially helping the two states in facing the impact of the disaster.The leaders passed a resolution in this regard and said relief and rehabilitation should be the topmost priority at this juncture.“We, the opposition parties, extend our sympathy and support to the governments and people of West Bengal and Odisha in meeting the impact of the devastation caused by Cyclone Amphan,” it said.The resolution said a natural calamity like Cyclone Amphan has come as a double blow to the states amid the coronavirus pandemic, breaking the spirits of people.“Opposition parties, therefore, urge the central government to immediately declare this as a national calamity and substantially help the states in facing the impact of this disaster,” it added.The resolution said the people of Odisha and West Bengal urgently need the support and solidarity of the governments and citizens of the country.Relief and rehabilitation should be the topmost priority at this juncture, it further said, adding the possibility of an outbreak of other diseases as a result of the calamity must also not be ignored.“We, the opposition parties, call upon the central government to provide urgent help to our fellow citizens/countrymen,” it said.The leaders also conveyed their deepest condolences to the families of those who lost their lives due to the cyclone.“We express our solidarity and sympathies with the pain of those who have suffered other losses. The country and its people are already in the midst of a grim struggle for survival combating the Covid-19 pandemic,” they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/refrain-from-using-covid-19-crisis-for-personal-political-gains-opposition-parties-to-centre/story-yJgnKv9HIijj1SxciA1EOM.html
22-05-2020||India||Maharashtra BJP launches protests against govt’s handling of Covid-19 pandemic||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) versus the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) battle was on full public display on Friday as the former held its ‘Maharashtra Bachao’ (Save Maharashtra) agitation, with party workers across the state in black masks, unfurled banners slamming the Thackeray-led government over its handling of the coronavirus pandemic.Two months after the first coronavirus case was identified in the state and a week after Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray secured his nomination to the Legislative Council, the BJP announced that it would no longer stay quiet and spoke out against the government’s “ineffectual” tackling of the pandemic.As part of its agitation, state BJP unit party workers were seen in social and broadcast media shouting slogans against the Thackeray government, holding placards in a symbolic protest. The protests were held outside their homes, state, district and city party offices in a move to roll out a campaign and to generate a sentiment against the government. The BJP has also demanded an independent fiscal package worth Rs 50,000 crore for farmers, daily wage earners in the state to combat Covid-19.The Shiv Sena and other ruling parties did not take this lightly and slammed the Opposition for playing politics amidst a full blown disaster. They also hit back on social media. And, by late afternoon on social media, both the BJP’s ‘Maharashtra Bachao’ and the state Congress’ ‘Maharashtra Drohi’ (Maharashtra’s traitors) were viral but the former was lagging behind the latter.“The maximum number of coronavirus cases and maximum deaths are in Maharashtra. The public health system has completely collapsed due to the state government’s failures. For how long can we co-operate with the government. How much can the people tolerate?” asked Fadnavis, who protested along with his party colleagues outside the state BJP office.A day earlier, Fadnavis had upped the ante targeting Thackeray directly as someone who was new and made “strategic failures” as he lacked “administrative experience”. The former CM has also alleged that the state and the city have reduced testing of patients in a bid to bring down the Covid-19 positive cases. He has alleged that despite having a capacity of conducting 10,000 tests, the BMC was conducting only around 4,500 tests daily.Sena Yuva chief and tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray in response to BJP’s protest tweeted : “One political party state unit has set a new low and a new world record – the only party in the world to indulge in politics and in spreading fear, hate and division when the world has forgotten all of it to help each other. This party has forgotten the pandemic.”Re-tweeting another photo where children are wearing black clothes, holding BJP flags and protesting, Thackeray said, “Absolutely shameful, what lust for power politics can make leaders do. Making children stand in heat, with their masks lowered, not covering their faces for a political protest when we need to keep them safe and indoors.”“Maharashtra Drohi hashtag has become viral across the country because people realise the true picture of the BJP. In the face of such a horrific disaster, only they can think of politics…let people die, we want power, is their mantra,” Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-bjp-launches-protests-against-govt-s-handling-of-covid-19-pandemic/story-RRVxTBTfVqQybp9wXus9CP.html
22-05-2020||India||‘Lockdown mostly achieved its purpose’: Govt lists gains, reveals strategy||A government constituted panel on Friday remarked that the almost two month long nationwide lockdown period beginning March 25 has served its purpose and it was not possible to continue it for an unlimited time. The chairman of the empowered group number 1, formed along with several others, added that the lockdown had given the country sufficient time to upgrade its health infrastructure to meet the challenges posed by any rapid spread in the coronavirus contagion.“Lockdown has mostly achieved its purpose, but it cannot be continued for unlimited time; we need to behave in a manner which makes it difficult for coronavirus to spread. This is the way forward,” said Dr V K Paul, Member (Health), NITIAayog and the Chairman of the Empowered Group 1.Further explaining his statement, Dr Paul said that the growth rate of Covid 19 cases has seen a steady fall since April 3, 2020, around eight days the imposition of the first phase of the lockdown. He said that the number of cases would have been much higher today, had the lockdown not been implemented.He added that this was also true for the death rate of the disease“Like number of cases, the growth rate of Covid-19 deaths, too, has fallen significantly due to the lockdown, marking a notable difference between pre-lockdown and post-lockdown situations,” he said.The chairman said India’s response to the unprecedented crisis presented by the pandemic could be summed up in four words: timely, graded, proactive and pre-emptive. “It has been part and parcel of our overall strategy,” said Dr Paul.Explaining it further, he pointed out that in less than two months, the country had scaled up its coronavirus fighting capability with 1,093 covid facilities comprising around 3.24 lakh hospital beds and 6.5 lakh beds in covid care centres.On testing capacity, it was pointed out that a total of 27,55,714 tests have been done till 1 PM on Friday. Friday was also the 4th day when more than 1 lakh tests were done in a single day.Also Read: Lockdown saved maximum 2.1 lakh lives, averted 70 lakh cases, claims a government modelDue to the continuous scaling up of all preventing measures, a total of 48,534 coronavirus patients have been cured so far, including 3,334 patients cured in the last 24 hours, taking up the recovery rate to 41% while 66,330 patients were under active medical supervision.“The time the nation got for preparation due to lockdown has been utilized very well, we can now say with confidence that we will be able to face the challenge and surmount it,” added Dr Paul.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lockdown-mostly-achieved-its-purpose-govt-lists-gains-reveals-strategy/story-z8e98UBVhzHitabwl9TfxL.html
22-05-2020||India||Haridwar starts collection of swab samples of migrant returnees||Haridwar district authorities have started collecting swab samples of migrant returnees after a recent order from the Uttarakhand high court (HC) that expressed concern over the influx of people following the easing of lockdown restrictions and insisted upon ramping up coronavirus disease (Covid-19) tests, especially in the hill state’s red zones. In Haridwar, migrants arriving from Uttarkashi, Rudraprayag, Chamoli are being put under institutional quarantine in light of the HC order to enforce surveillance mechanism.Chief medical officer, Haridwar, Dr Saroj Naithani said 479 swab samples were collected from Kaliyar area from the passengers, who reached the temple town by a Shramik Special train from Mumbai on Thursday.“Around 200 samples were collected from Haridwar district on Thursday,” she said.“On Friday at 5 am, a Shramik Special train arrived from Amritsar, carrying 317 passengers, whose swab samples have been collected. Those who are travelling by road are also being tested and quarantined. They will be allowed to go back to their native places, as soon as they test Covid-19 negative,” Dr Naithani said.Haridwar district education officer (DEO), basic education, Brahampal Singh Saini has directed all officials to ensure arrangement for accommodation and food for migrant returnees, who are staying at makeshift quarantine centres on school premises.“All school principals and deputy education officials have been directed to maintain social distancing norms. While food for migrant returnees is being prepared by Bhojan Matas, who usually cook mid-day meal for school students,” said DEO Saini.On Tuesday, Uttarakhand HC had directed the state government to procure rapid test kits at the earliest and start conducting tests on an experimental basis, as the Indian Council for Medical Research’s (ICMR) approval is still pending, at the hill state border points in a bid to increase surveillance mechanism.The HC also directed the state government to set up quarantine centres at each border point, as over two lakh people are expected to enter Uttarakhand after the lockdown restrictions are lifted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/haridwar-starts-collection-of-swab-samples-of-migrant-returnees/story-mtvkgsQG2LnsOyDVXG4GnO.html
22-05-2020||India||‘Rajasthan made us pay for Kota students’ ride home’: UP govt to Congress||Steppin up its attack on the Congress, the Uttar Pradesh government on Friday alleged that the Rajasthan government, helmed by Congress’ Ashok Gehlot, recovered Rs 36.5 lakh from it for the 90 additional buses it provided for bringing stranded students from Kota. “On the one hand you do not even show the courtesy of dropping our students stranded in your state at the UP border and ask us to pay the cost for ferrying students; on the other hand you try to show off your sense of public service and sensitivity by offering buses for migrants in UP,” deputy CM Dinesh Sharma, flanked transport minister Ashok Katariya, said at a press conference.The BJP leader accused the Congress of being “two-faced” and sought a public apology for misrepresenting facts over arranging buses for migrants, which it called a “political stunt”. “The Congress must render an apology for misleading the nation, especially the migrant workers for its two-faced character,” Sharma said. Detailing the Kota episode, Sharma said UP had sent buses to bring stranded students back on April 18 but it fell short of vehicles. They could bring only 10,000 students whereas the number were 12,000.“Therefore, the UPSRTC requested Rajasthan state road transport corporation (RSRTC) to provide 90 additional buses to ferry all the students back home. They did agree but on the condition that the UPSRTC give this in writing that it would bear the cost to which we agreed and sent a written request immediately accordingly,” Sharma said.Elaborating further, Katariya said that Rajasthan raised a bill of Rs 19.75 lakh on May 1 towards diesel that UPSRTC’s 560 buses sourced from the Kota depot and the entire amount was paid to them on May 5.“Again, on May 18 they sent the UPSRTC a reminder for the payment of another amount of Rs 36.36 lakh as the fare for the 90 buses the UPSRTC hired from RSRTC for bringing students from Kota to Agra and the UPSRTC paid the entire amount back on May 20,” he said.He said though students belonged to UP, they were staying in Rajasthan for the study purpose and hence the Rajasthan government was equally accountable for their well-being. “Should the Rajasthan government have not shown the courtesy of dropping these students free of cost on the UP borders at least if not to their homes?” he asked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-made-us-pay-for-kota-students-ride-home-up-govt-to-congress/story-bcqoI4kjDY3mtUH4GagpZM.html
22-05-2020||India||It’s only a pause, more steps to come to deal with Covid-19 crisis: Anurag Thakur||The government has only taken a pause and more measures will be announced in the days to come to help sectors hit by the coronavirus outbreak and also to make India ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’, Minister of State for Finance Anurag Thakur said. Since the outbreak of the pandemic, the government has taken several steps to mitigate the hardships of the people due to lockdown and support growth, Thakur told PTI in an interview. Only this Sunday, he said, the government on the direction of Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a comprehensive economic package of Rs 20.97 lakh crore to support the economy hit hard by COVID-19. “We came first with the ease of compliance. The second was for the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan package (Rs 1.70 lakh crore) and the third was this stimulus package of Rs 20.97 lakh crore. This can’t be the end,” he said while sharing details of a series of announcements. “The announcements have taken a pause and the action will continue,” the minister said when asked whether the government was expected to come out with more measures to deal with the current economic crisis following the coronavirus outbreak. Emphasising that the Modi government is sensitive to the needs of people and businesses, he said, the ministry is taking the inputs from various sectors. “Tourism is a very very important sector for us. Hospitality is an important sector for us. Civil Aviation is an important sector for us. In a country like India where they contribute to the GDP, not only GDP but millions of jobs have been provided through these sectors. We are very open about these sectors, and others if any have been left out. “But let me say here also many will also fall into other categories which have been benefited. Some will benefit from the series of announcements made for the MSME sector. Small hotels which fall into this category can take advantage of the announcement made in the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan package,” he said. Stressing that economic reform is a continuous process, the minister said, “I’ll say the year 2020 will be known as the year of reforms.” In bold reforms aimed at boosting the sagging economy, the government last week announced several reforms including a slew of measures for the agriculture sector, defence manufacturing, civil aviation and mining sector. “The long-pending demand for the change of definition of MSME, taking farmers out of the clutches of the Essential Commodities Act and the APMC Act have been seen as historic steps. Opening up of the coal mining and mineral sector at the same time has been a very positive step towards self-reliance,” he said. “Apart from that opening up of the space sector is not a small reform. Permitting foreign investors to own up to a 74 per cent stake in defence manufacturing ventures under the automatic route, from the current 49 per cent limit is another big bold move,” he said. Also, the list of weapons that cannot be imported will be expanded to give Make in India a boost and cut down the import bill and improve export potential. Rebutting the criticism that the government has not done enough to push demand, the minister said that the central government has transferred funds directly to the needy, whether it was fund transfer to 20.5 crore Jan Dhan account holders or 2.2 crore national security assistance programme beneficiaries, or 9 crore farmers. Besides, he said, the Modi government has undertaken several other measures which will directly benefit the needy people. These include distribution of free ration to about 80 crore people, gas cylinders under the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana etc. The government, the minister said, has announced a series of measures to help the MSME sector which employs the highest number of people (about 12 crores) after agriculture. Among other things, the government has made a provision of Rs 3 lakh crore of collateral-free loan for the MSME sector. “I think this is going to give a boost to the MSME sector,” the minister said, adding it will help in protecting jobs and there would be no more layoffs. At the same time, the minister said, the money in the hands of people will go a long way in boosting aggregate demand in the economy.

22-05-2020||India||3.5 million new enrolments under MGNREGA, as ‘distressed’ workers return to villages||As many as 3.5 million new workers have sought jobs under MGNREGA since April 1, the highest number of applications in a decade, but there may not be enough work to engage them all, according to government data and officials in multiple states.According to the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme website, around 3.5 million new job applications have come in the current financial year since April 1 till May 20. For the same period in the last fiscal, the new applicants were about 1.8 lakh. A clear indication of rural economic distress is that in the entire 2019-20, the applications for new jobs were about 1.5 million, less than half of what has been received in mere 50 days of the current financial year.The national data also showed that the cumulative job applications as on May 20 stood at 43.3 million people and only half of them have been provided work so far. The maximum increase in demand for jobs cards has been from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Odisha, states which have received the most number of migrant workers from various parts of the country.Seeing the surge in demand, many of the state governments have directed district authorities to create a pool of additional work and get approvals within the next fortnight. Under MGNREGA, district authorities are expected to create a work budget for the year on the basis of the job applicants in February and March of the previous financial year.“Situation is different this year as demand for work started growing in April once the migrants started returning home,” Sidharth Tripathy, Jharkhand’s special MGNREGA commissioner, said. Rajasthan’s NREGA commissioner PC Kishan said normally there is a slight increase, three to 5%, in new job applications when the financial year starts. “This year, we have seen two lakh new job cards since April 1, which is equal to new job cards issued in the entire 2019-2020. This is not normal,” Kishan said.Nikhil Dey, who has worked on MGNREGA since the law came into force in 2005, said the number of new job applications received in the past two months normally comes in a year.“Apart from the migrants returning home, even locals are seeking job under NREGA because of lack of employment opportunities anywhere,” Dey said.State government officials said as there are not enough sanctioned works, there is a delay in providing employment to so many people. “Nobody had anticipated such a situation,” Jharkhand’s Tripathy said and added they have been engaging MGNREGA workers in pre-monsoon works such as maintaining of ponds or digging of wells. “We have also taken additional road construction work where MGNREGA worker can be employed,” he said.Bihar’s rural development department secretary Arvind Kumar Chaudhary said the department has decided to employ MGNREGA workers for flood management works that have started from May first week. Odisha would be using migrant workers, who have returned, in works to repairing the damage and rebuilding from Cyclone Amphan, apart from pre-monsoon works and for road construction.The state’s bid to provide more work has got impetus from the central government, which has decided to give Rs 40,000 crore in addition to Rs 61,000 crore provided in the budget for 2020-21. This, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said last week, will be the largest ever allocation for MGNREGA and would give a boost to the world’s biggest minimum social security programme that ensures minimum 100 days of work in a year and covers entire rural India.“We welcome the decision but around 15,000 crore will be used to clear pending amounts from the last financial year. The states need to create enough works to employ all those who have enrolled. If needed, MGNREGA workers can be used for agriculture purpose as there is a shortage of farm labourers,” Reetika Khera, a development economist working with Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Delhi, said.MGNREGA, which has been decried in the past by some leaders for incurring wasteful expenditure, is now providing succour to migrant workers returning from cities.“I was working with a building construction company in Bilaspur town but due to lockdown the work stop hence I enrolled myself in MNREGA at my village in Ratanpur. At least I am doing some work and earning some money,” Ratnakar Yadu, a resident of Chhattisgarh’s Bilaspur district, said.Kashiram Ahirwar, a 38-year-old resident of village Mau Bichhoda in Bundelkhand’s Tikamgarh district, returned his village with his wife and two children after losing his mason’s job in Bhind. “As no construction activity is going on and harvest season is also over here, my only hope is MGNREGA,” he said. Like him, Balveer Ahirwar, 23, of village Ladwari in the same district and his brother came back after losing their job due to lockdown. They reached from Delhi on May 13, after a week-long journey. “We have no money left and five quintal wheat from my father’s farm also did not fetch enough money. I and my Ashok are pleading sarpanch to give us work. But, he says that works have not been sanctioned by the local office,” he said. Jabbar Ahmad, 43, who returned to Bihar’s East Champaran town from Surat, where he used to work in a cotton factory, is looking for a job under MGNREGA.“I am a trained worker for cotton factory but I am looking for a job under MGNREGA for instant relief,” said Ahmad. Shirsat Kapil Ashok, East Champaran district magistrate, said many trained people, including some contractual teachers, were asking for a scope to work under MGNREGA. In some places, there have been reports of school teachers enrolling in the scheme for work.As for the work provided under the scheme, the national MGNREGA website shows that Rajasthan emerged as the top state in the country with close to 210,000 new works issued in the past 45 days of this financial year.“We are focusing on the rural job guarantee scheme to provide financial security to rural populations in the current scenario. This has resulted in 24.31 lakh labour engaged in NREGA today,” Sachin Pilot, Rajasthan’s deputy chief minister, said.Chhattisgarh, which has employed 28.32 lakh people under the scheme, highest ever for the state, has decided that if needed more than 100 days work will be provided under the scheme.“We are clear if people want we would provide additional work under NREGA for workers in our state even if we have to pay from our own pocket,” said state chief minister Bhupesh Baghel, who has already asked the Centre to increase the employment days in a year from 100 to 150 days. Bhupesh Baghel also said collectors have been asked to ensure that migrants get work under MGNREGA. Deepak Soni, Surajpur’s collector, said after the quarantine period the workers are being provided work. MGNREGA workers in Chhattisgarh have never crossed 15 lakh mark.Uttar Pradesh, which has more than half a million new job seeks, has asked districts officials to create new roasters to accommodate additional MGNREGA workers. “Providing them work at the same time would not be possible for all workers. We would provide them employment in a staggered manner so that more families can be covered in the social security scheme,” a UP rural development department official, who did not want to be named, said.(With inputs from state bureaus)Top 5 states in terms of labour engagement on May 21State Labour engaged (in lakhs) Rajasthan 32.31 Uttar Pradesh 30.64 Chhattisgarh 28.32 Madhya Pradesh 22.82 West Bengal 18.42||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-5-million-new-enrolments-under-mgnrega-as-distressed-workers-return-to-villages/story-aDJHYz0vz1tSeLleIhVT7I.html
22-05-2020||India||Lockdown saved maximum 2.1 lakh lives, averted 70 lakh cases, claims a government model||A government empowered group formed to devise, monitor and implement India’s coronavirus containment effort has claimed that the nationwide lockdown implemented first on March 25 to break the chain of transmissions in the early stages of the spread of Covid-19 infections in the country has been successful in saving hundreds of thousands of lives and slowing down the growth of the disease as per the projections made by several mathematical models.According to a Boston Consulting Group (BCG) model, the lockdown has saved between 1.2 - 2.1 lakh lives, and averted between 36 - 70 lakh positive cases of Covid-19, claimed the chairman of empowered group I.The projection models, prepared to gauge the efficacy of preventive measures including the lockdown, were presented on Friday afternoon during the routine press conference of government officials meant to provide updates on the status of Covid containment efforts.According to another estimate made by ‘independent economists’, around 68,000 deaths were averted in India due to implementation of lockdown, while helping prevent an additional 23 lakh positive cases, said the chairman. He presented another model prepared by the Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI), which claimed that the lockdown had helped in saving 78,000 lives.Dr V K Paul, Member (Health), NITIAayog and the chairman of the empowered group number 1 also highlighted the various other advantages handed out by the lockdown and said it ensured that the cases remained limited to certain areas.“80% of all active cases were in just 5 states, more than 60% cases are in just 5 cities, the spread of Covid-19 infection has remained limited to certain areas, this is no small achievement, and also gives confidence to open up other areas,” said Dr Paul.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Delhi and Rajasthan are the five worst victims of the coronavirus pandemic in India.He went on to claim that the growth rate of Covid19 cases has witnessed a steady fall from April 3, 2020, when the lockdown was able to put a brake on the speed of rise in infections.“The number of cases today would have been much higher, had lockdown not been implemented,” he said.The lockdown was first implemented on March 25 till April 14 and then extended in its second phase to May 3, followed by the third phase which ended on May 17. The country is now in a gradual exit mode with the national lockdown entering its fourth phase with graded resumption of economic activities.Dr Paul added that the lockdown not only put brakes on the rising number of positive cases, but it also ensured that the rate of Covid-19 related deaths, too, came down significantly. The difference in the death rates was notable between pre-lockdown and post-lockdown situations, he claimed.The official presentation on the efficacy of lockdown and other containment measures taken by the government comes on a day when a meeting of opposition parties was organized by Congress president Sonia Gandhi, who was particularly harsh on government’s handling of the crisis while alleging that the centre had no exit strategy from the lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lockdown-saved-maximum-2-1-lakh-lives-averted-70-lakh-cases-claims-a-government-model/story-BtZypgevlb4Tij0tOgf66M.html

Current efforts by the government, whether it is the timing of the Covid-19 lockdown or the use of technology for combating the pandemic and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call for self-reliance, are being showcased by the BJP as accomplishments during the year.The BJP came to power at the Centre for a second term in May 2019 with an unprecedented majority of 303 Lok Sabha members following the General election. Though the party has much to celebrate, such as passing the law to read down Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, the ban on triple talaq and the decks being cleared by the Supreme Court for the building a Ram Temple in Ayodhya, the Covid-19 crisis has put a spanner in the works.Giving details of the online programme that is open to all, Vinay Sahasrabuddhe, national vice president of the BJP and honorary director of PPRC, said the Modi government has offered good governance since it first came to power in 2014, and its emphasis on last-mile delivery, efficient execution of schemes and use of TECHNOLOGY played a key role in its return to power last year.The course will have bureaucrats, both serving and retired, as resource persons. Health ministry joint secretary Lav Agarwal and NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant are likely to be part of the five-day course.On its website, PPRC described the course in good governance as one “imbued with public interest that demands exemplary collaborative inputs in the administration”.PPRC director Sumeet Bhasin said the programme will cover 10 topics, including the historical perspective of good governance, targeted last mile delivery, role of leadership, use of technology, and theory for Aatma Nirbhar Bharat (self reliant India).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-to-offer-five-day-online-course-in-good-governance/story-s20BmgdLeTbSmDlJRB3t6J.html
22-05-2020||India||Along with Rs 1k crore, PM Modi pledges ‘shoulder to shoulder’ help to Bengal||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday afternoon declared an advance assistance fund of Rs 1000 crore for relief and rehabilitation in Amphan-hit districts of Bengal after conducting an aerial survey of the worst-hit areas in the North and South 24 Parganas districts with chief minister Mamata Banerjee.“The state and the Centre tried their best to take precautionary measures before the cyclone. But despite that around 80 lives have been lost. This is very unfortunate. The government of India will work shoulder to shoulder with the state administration. We are announcing the release of an advance assistance fund of Rs 1,000 crore,” said PM Modi in Hindi. Before the Prime Minister arrived at the Kolkata airport, Banerjee said, “We heard last evening that he (Modi) would be coming. Sometimes we have to move out of politics and attend to constitutional obligations and work together as state and Central governments. We have to maintain that relationship. We have to follow the federal structure,” said Banerjee. “While we have received reports of 80 deaths so far, six crore people in the state have been directly affected. This (Amphan) has done more damage than any other natural disaster,” said Banerjee.Modi also declared Rs 2 lakh as assistance to families of the dead and Rs 50,000 to the injured people from the Prime Minister’s disaster relief fund.Before making the announcements, the Prime Minister went for an aerial survey with Banerjee for the first time and even held a meeting with state officials at Basirhat in the North 24 Parganas. They flew over the worst affected areas in a 10-seat army chopper for around one hour.Modi sought a report on the damages and said central teams would also visit Bengal for damage assessment, said officials who attended the administrative meeting.Also Read: ‘West Bengal is fighting well’: PM Modi’s rare praise for Mamata Banerjee“The fight against the coronavirus and the fight against the cyclone are completely different in nature. To fight the coronavirus, we ask people to stay at home while during the cyclone we ask people to leave their homes and take shelter in safe places. Under the leadership of Mamata Banerjee, the state has fought both the situations. West Bengal has to fight. We have to work together,” said Modi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/along-with-rs-1k-crore-pm-modi-pledges-shoulder-to-shoulder-help-to-bengal/story-vucFrgS7ufERBY2DXxryCJ.html
22-05-2020||India||‘Govt uncertain about lockdown, does not have exit plan’: Sonia Gandhi at opposition meet||Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Friday attacked the Centre, saying it has “abandoned any pretence” of being a democratic government and all power is now concentrated in the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) while the “spirit of federalism is all but forgotten”. Addressing a meeting of 22 like-minded parties held through video-conferencing, she also described Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s May 12 announcement of the Rs 20 lakh crore stimulus package as a “cruel joke” on the country. Gandhi came down heavily on the government for giving just a four-hour notice for imposing the nationwide lockdown on March 24 to contain the spread of the deadly coronavirus.“All of us supported the decision despite its suddenness and obvious unpreparedness of the government,” she said.This is the first meeting of the opposition parties after the nationwide lockdown came into force on March 25.The meeting is attended by former Prime Minister and Janata Dal (Secular) leader HD Deve Gowda, Maharashtra chief minister and Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray and his colleague Sanjay Raut, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) president Sharad Pawar and his party leader Praful Patel, Trinamool Congress supremo and West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee and her colleague Derek O’Brien, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) chief MK Stalin, Communist Party of India (Marxist) general secretary Sitaram Yechury, Communist Party of India (CPI) general secretary D Raja and Jharkhand chief minister and Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) chief Hemant Soren.Sharad Yadav of the Loktantrik Janata Dal (LJD), Tejashwi Yadav and Manoj Jha of the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) leader PK Kunhalikutty, Omar Abdullah of the Jammu and Kashmir National Conference (JKNC), All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) chief Badruddin Ajmal, Jayant Choudhary of the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD), Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP) chief Upendra Kushwaha, Jitin Ram Manjhi of the Hindustani Awam Morcha (HAM), NK Premachandran of the Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP), Kerala Congress (Mani) leader Jose K Mani, Raju Shetty of the Swabhiman Paksh, Thol Thirumavalavan of the Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK) and Prof Kondandaram of the Telangana Jana Samiti (TJS) too are attending.Apart from Gandhi, the Congress is represented by Rahul Gandhi, AK Antony, Ghulam Nabi Azad, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, mallikarjun Kharge and Ahmed Patel.However, the Samajwadi Party (SP), the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) skipped the meeting.In her opening remarks, the Congress chief also said the initial optimism of the Prime Minister that the war against the virus would conclude in 21 days has turned out to be misplaced. “It seems that the virus is here to stay until a vaccine is found. I am also of the view that the government was uncertain about the criteria for lockdowns, nor does it have an exit strategy. Successive lockdowns have yielded diminishing returns,” she claimed.Gandhi claimed that the defining image of the Covid-19 pandemic has been the lakhs of migrant workers, many with children, walking hundreds of kilometres, without money, food or medicines, desperate to reach their home states.“Apart from the plight of the migrant workers, those who have been cruelly ignored include the 13 crore families at the bottom half of the population, including tenant farmers and landless agricultural workers, laid off or retrenched workers and employees, shopkeepers and self-employed, the 5.8 crore out of the 6.3 crore MSMEs, and organised industries, including the large businesses, that drive our country’s growth,” she said. Gandhi said India was facing an economic crisis even before the first coronavirus cases were identified. “Demonetisation and a hasty and flawed GST were amongst its main causes. The economic downturn began in 2017-18. Seven quarters of declining GDP growth was no ordinary event; it was unprecedented. Yet, the government carried on with its misguided policies and incompetent governance,” she said.“The economy has been gravely crippled. Every economist of repute had advised an immediate need for a massive fiscal stimulus. The Prime Minister’s announcement on May 12 of a grand Rs 20 lakh crore package - and the finance minister (Nirmala Sitharaman) spelling out its details over the next five days, have turned out to be a cruel joke on the country,” the Congress chief alleged. Gandhi said the opposition parties had demanded that cash must be transferred to the poor, free grain be distributed to all families, buses and trains be arranged for migrant workers to go back to their homes and wage assistance and wage protection funds be set up to protect the employees and the employers.“Our pleas have fallen on deaf ears. Far from offering succour and support, the government has embarked on a wild adventure of so-called reforms including a grand clearance sale of PSUs and repeal of labour laws,” she added.“There is not even pretence of consultation with stakeholders or debate in Parliament. We deplore these unilateral moves.”The Congress president said a number of renowned economists are predicting that 2020-21 will end with negative growth of up to minus 5%.“The consequences will be catastrophic. That the present government has no solutions is worrying but that it has no empathy or compassion for the poor and vulnerable is heartbreaking,” she added. “The government has also abandoned any pretence of being a democratic government. All power is now concentrated in one office, the PMO. The spirit of Federalism, which is an integral part of our Constitution, is all but forgotten.” Gandhi claimed that there is no indication either if the two Houses of Parliament or the standing committees will be summoned to meet. “It is our duty to offer constructive criticism and suggestions, and be the voice of the people,” she said.At the beginning, Gandhi expressed profound “sense of sorrow” at the enormous damage caused in West Bengal and Odisha by Cyclone Amphan, including the loss of 80 lives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-uncertain-about-lockdown-does-not-have-exit-strategy-sonia-gandhi-at-opposition-meet/story-r0kF4rOxnSJC2kcAk7E0yL.html

22-05-2020||India||Petition challenging PM Modi’s election from Varanasi adjourned by two weeks||The Supreme Court on Friday adjourned the hearing on the petition challenging the election of Prime Minister Narendra Modi from Varanasi parliamentary seat held in May last year. The matter will now be taken up after two weeks.The petition has been filed by sacked Border Security Force (BSF) constable Tej Bahadur who could not contest from Varanasi since his nomination paper was rejected by the returning officer on May 1 last year. Bahadur challenged PM Modi’s election before the Allahabad High Court, but lost. HC dismissed the petition on December 6, 2019 holding that Bahadur had no locus to challenge the election as he was neither a candidate nor an elector.This was the first hearing on Bahadur’s appeal against the HC verdict in the Supreme Court. He alleged there were several technical flaws in the HC judgment dismissing his case.A bench of Chief Justice SA Bobde, Justices AS Bopanna and Hrishikesh Roy were ready to hear arguments. But Bahadur’s lawyers moved a letter for a four-week adjournment without specifying any reason. The Court refused to grant such time and instead posted the matter after two weeks. PM Modi was represented by senior advocates Harish Salve and Satya Pal Jain.Bahadur’s nomination was rejected as a clause contained in the Representation of Peoples Act prescribes a five-year ban on contesting against any person in the employment of the state who got dismissed on grounds of corruption or disloyalty to state. Bahadur claimed he was dismissed but on grounds other than corruption or disloyalty. In such cases, the candidate must attach a certificate of the Election Commission testifying this fact. Bahadur did not possess this certificate and hence his nomination got rejected.Bahadur shot to fame in 2017, when he shot a video exposing the alleged poor quality of food supplied to BSF jawans in their camp.

22-05-2020||India||‘Under Mamata Banerjee’s leadership’: PM Modi’s rare praise for Bengal chief minister||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday announced a Rs 1,000 crore assistance to West Bengal after a first-hand assessment of the destruction due to cyclone Amphan this week. PM Modi, who assured people that the Centre would stand by the Trinamool Congress-ruled state, also showered rare praise on chief minister Mamata Banerjee who has been his fierce critic.In a video statement made as he wrapped up the Bengal leg of his visit - he flew down to neighbouring Odisha - PM Modi noted that West Bengal was faced with a difficult situation because of the cyclone at a time the state and the country is battling with the coronavirus disease.To deal with Covid-19, social distancing is required and people are told to stay where they are. But the cyclone required people in the affected areas to vacate their houses and move to safer places, he said.But Bengal under Mamata Banerjee’s leadership has made commendable efforts.Watch l ‘Fighting Covid & cyclone’: PM Modi announces interim relief for West Bengal “Despite these contradictions, West Bengal is fighting well,” PM Modi’s office later tweeted, reiterating PM Modi’s commitment to stand with the people of Bengal in these “testing times”.PM Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party and Mamata Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress have been bitter rivals in Bengal for years, particularly after the BJP set its eyes on getting a foothold in the state’s politics.In last year’s general elections, the BJP’s aggressive campaign delivered 18 of Bengal’s 42 Lok Sabha seats. Much of this increase came at the cost of the Trinamool Congress which had to settle for 22 seats, down from the 32 it had won in 2014.Home Minister Amit Shah, who had led the BJP campaign in Bengal and is credited for expanding the party’s tally from 2 to 18 Lok Sabha seats in five years, has made it clear that the BJP was aiming to come to power in Bengal in next year’s assembly elections.Not surprisingly, Mamata Banerjee has been the BJP’s favourite punching bag in Bengal and is seen to be deeply suspicious of its moves.Like when the Centre sent an inter-ministerial team to Bengal, among other states, Mamata Banerjee was the only chief minister to question the Centre’s motives. The central team was told to stay put at their guest house by state officials and not move out without a police escort.The central team was still able to find flaws in the state’s handling of Covid-19, gaps that provided the state BJP leadership ammunition to target Mamata Banerjee and her government.Back home in Kolkata, she also has a running feud with Governor Jagdeep Dhankar who often accuses her government of keeping him in the dark. Dhankar had fired his last attack at the state government over the Kolkata municipal corporation less than 24 hours earlier.To be sure, Governor Dhankar has not attacked Mamata Banerjee for her handling of cyclone Amphan either. Hours before PM Modi landed in Kolkata - the governor also accompanied him on the aerial survey and attended the review meetings he chaired - Jagdeep Dhankar announced on Twitter that he had contributed Rs 50 lakh to the chief minister’s fund for Amphan relief work and asked people to chip in too.Friday’s interaction between PM Modi and chief minister Mamata Banerjee was a contrast to the prime minister’s last visit to the state in January this year amid the protests over the amended citizenship law.Banerjee had then deputed a minister to receive him at the airport and skipped a Kolkata Port Trust event. But she did later call on PM Modi at Raj Bhavan, describing it as a courtesy to the visiting dignitary.A statement by the Prime Minister’s Office on PM Modi’s flying visit on Friday underlined that this was his second visit to the state this year. West Bengal, the PMO statement said, is the only state apart from Uttar Pradesh, where PM Modi has had multiple visits this year.Prime Minister Modi hasn’t stepped out of Delhi for months due to the coronavirus outbreak and the emphasis on people staying at home. A PMO official said PM Modi’s last outstation visit was to Uttar Pradesh’s Prayagraj and Chitrakoot on February 28.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/west-bengal-is-fighting-well-pm-modi-s-rare-praise-for-mamata-banerjee/story-I0UBEUqOGNKKVnBHI7FyXM.html
22-05-2020||India||Solutions to tackle future pandemics lies in conserving biodiversity: Experts||Mankind can find solutions for future pandemics in conservation of biodiversity, which simply means conserving the gene pool of all things living, for posterity. Gene pools can be classified into possible usages like fighting pandemics, fighting hunger, fighting garbage in our cities, in landfills and in oceans, fighting air pollution, and above all, fighting climate change.The story of human civilization is one of harnessing biodiversity to its advantage. All crops were derived from wild plants. All domesticated animals were hybridized variants of their wild cousins. Almost all medicines owe their origin to nature.This diversity of living beings and diversity of ecosystems within which they flourish (oceans, deserts, mountains etc) make up for overall biodiversity. The vast numbers of different kinds of living organisms that make up Earth’s biodiversity are a result of three-and-a-half billion years of evolution.Benefits of biodiversity are measured in terms of ecosystem services. It is believed that value of ecosystem services is significantly larger than global GDP of all countries. An example of ecosystem services would be the service of pollination of plants provided by bees. Just imagine if there were no bees, what it would take to pollinate the plants across the world, manually!But like everything good, biodiversity too could be under threat. There have been five major mass extinctions, owing to cataclysmic changes in the environment. Some experts believe that we are now headed for a sixth mass extinction. This one will be caused by loss of habitat.India is ranked high among the countries with greatest degree of biodiversity (it has about 7% of the global faunal and about 10% of the global floral total species), and we, therefore, have most to lose – unless we take effective collective action now, to save humanity, to save the world, to save our children and our future generations.We need collective action across individuals, families, communities, nations to save biodiversity. We must conserve forests and associated biodiversity, and work towards achieving the common goal of having 33% of India’s land under forest cover.If the human race has to survive, all other life forms must survive to support the web of life. Human race has the ability to decide the future of itself and future of other life forms.Thousands of years ago, great thinkers of India contemplated the same and came up with a universal maxim of ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’ which means the universe is my family. Let us trust that all solutions are within nature (biodiversity), and we promise to protect our common future.(GV Reddy, IFS officer, is Principal Chief Conservator of Forests, head of forest force in Rajasthan and Chairman of the Rajasthan State Biodiversity Board; Avneesh Makkar is group finance director of an MNC in India.)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/solutions-to-tackle-future-pandemics-lies-in-conserving-biodiversity-experts/story-1JWOAa5amHQe3Pmwu0NidP.html
22-05-2020||India||DRI sounds alert over smuggling of infrared thermometers into India from China||The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) has sounded an alert to different customs formations across the country to check smuggling of infrared thermometers into the country from China, officials said on Friday. The move assumes significance as the demand of such thermometers have spiked in the country due to the coronavirus pandemic. “The DRI has sent an alert to inland container depots and the cargo airport in Delhi and other places across the country, dealing with the import and export of commodities from abroad, among others asking them to be vigilant about such smuggling,” an official said. He said there is information to suggest that smugglers may under-value or mis-declare these thermometers to illegally import them to India. A good being brought into the country can be under-invoiced with an intention to evade customs duty to defraud the government exchequer. In this method, the invoice being filed with authorities for the import of the goods is falsified to show that the price of goods being imported is lower than the actual price being paid by an importer abroad. India had lost a staggering USD 13 billion, over Rs 90,000 crore, to trade mis-invoicing (that includes under and over invoicing), equivalent to 5.5 per cent of the value of the country’s total revenue collections in 2016, according to a 2019 report by the US-based think-tank Global Financial Integrity. A non-contact infrared/thermal thermometer of a reputed manufacturing firm may cost anywhere between Rs 3,500 and Rs 8,000, according to the websites selling them. The officials also suspect that the smugglers may exploit the free trade zone of Dubai port to route the goods for sending them to India. “A strict vigilance is maintained to thwart such attempts to cause damage to the Indian economy and the local manufacturers,” the official said, referring to the DRI alert issued recently. The DRI is a federal economic intelligence agency under the Finance Ministry mandated to check commercial frauds among others. The customs formations are on alert to thwart any attempts of smuggling. About 2,500 kg of raw material for masks was intercepted by air cargo export here on May 13. In addition to these, the customs officials had intercepted multiple shipments containing 5.08 lakh masks, 57 litres of sanitiser in 950 bottles and 952 PPE kits at the courier terminal in New Delhi. These were attempted to be smuggled out of the country to the US, UK and the UAE among others, they said. The goods were mis-declared as packing materials for pouches to avoid suspicion and further scrutiny by the customs officials. The export of such goods is prohibited by the government due to the coronavirus outbreak. Many countries have either increased the production of such products or ordered their import owing to domestic demands as they stare at its possible shortage. Customs officials in Chennai recently thwarted an attempt to illegally smuggle out over 1,000 kg of red sanders wood to Malaysia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dri-sounds-alert-over-smuggling-of-infrared-thermometers-into-india-from-china/story-Cxo6LSZofXf7JpWsK138jM.html

22-05-2020||India||Supreme Court seeks Centre’s response in plea to ban use of Zoom app||The Supreme Court (SC) on Friday sought the response of the central government in a plea seeking a ban on the use of Zoom software application, citing privacy and security concerns.Zoom app, which is owned by the US-headquartered company, Zoom Video Communications, enables video conferences and online chat facilities. The use of the platform is free for video conferences of up to 100 participants with a 40-minute time limit. For longer or larger conferences with more features, paid subscriptions are available.The petitioner, Harsh Chugh, who is a part-time tutor, told the apex court that the sudden boom in the use of Zoom application because of the lockdown restrictions, which were imposed to prevent the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak, has severely compromised cyberspace security, as personal data of its users are being routinely leaked. “Poor privacy and security of the application have enabled the hackers to get access to the meeting, classes, and conferences being conducted online through this application. Zoom is reported to have a bug that can be abused intentionally to leak information of users to third parties,” the plea said.Chugh prayed that there should be a ban on the use of Zoom for both official and personal purposes until an appropriate law addressing data security issues is put in place.A bench, headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde, issued notice to the central government in the matter.The petition pointed out that the Zoom application saw exponential growth in its users from 10 million in December 2019 to 200 million in March 2020 due to the pandemic-induced lockdown restrictions.The petitioner alleged that the application has made false claims that its calls are end-to-end encrypted.Chugh also alleged that Zoom practices data hoarding, including mass storage of users’ personal data.“Zoom was capitalising off the pandemic by selling users’ information to Facebook without their consent. Zoom is sending the data it collects from the computer of its users even if they weren’t logged on to a Facebook account,” the petition said.It was also contended that the application causes a serious violation of the right to privacy which is a fundamental right, under Article 21 of the Constitution.“Zoom is reported to have a bug that can be abused intentionally to leak information of users to third parties. Zoom pedals its products knowing that hackers are accessing users’ webcams, exposing them to extreme invasions of privacy,” it added.On April 1, the ministry of home (MHA) affairs through its cyber coordination committee had issued an advisory on the secure use of Zoom by private individuals. This advisory stated that the platform is not for use for official purposes.The petitioner pointed out that various high courts across the country are still using the application, despite the MHA advisory.“The Bombay high court recently decided to live stream hearing on a trial basis. The bench of Justice GS Patel made the hearing of listed matters on April 9 publicly accessible. The hearing in the court of Justice Patel could be accessed by anyone and everyone via the Zoom application. Similarly, the Kerala high court has also started live-streaming of court hearings through this application,” the plea stated.It was also submitted that the Zoom founder and chief executive officer, Eric S Yuan, had accepted the fact that his company was not prepared for the influx of novice users.“It’s not safe to conduct these conferences through an application, which has already been banned in several countries over security issues. The founder of the application has himself accepted that it has certain bugs leading to leakage of data and making it easy for hackers to access them,” the plea added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-seeks-centre-s-response-in-plea-to-ban-use-of-zoom-app/story-yXNMzxc957MUPkVJxEiTyM.html

These include minor children born to Indian nationals abroad who hold OCI cards; those who want to travel for family emergencies and university students who are OCI card holders but whose parents are Indian citizens living in India.The announcement was made by the ministry of home affairs on Friday, and it comes close on the heels of the country widening its expatriates’ extraction programme called Vande Bharat Mission to the third phase. In the second phase, which started on May 16, India in a special operation, is bringing back around 32,000 citizens on more than 160 flights from 47 countries .ALSO WATCH | Vande Bharat mission phase two begins 16 May: All you need to know The home ministry order partially resolves issues raised by hundreds of thousands of people whose visas were suspended following imposition of restrictions on international travel in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. . According to the order,” It is now been decided to permit the following categories of Overseas Citizens of India cardholders who are stranded abroad.1) Minor children holding born to Indian nationals abroad and holding OCI cards2) OCI cardholders who wish to come to India on account of family emergencies like death in the family.3) Couples where one spouse is an OCI cardholder and the others is an Indian national and they have a permanent residence in India.4) University students who are OCI cardholders (not legally minors) but whose parents are Indian Citizens living in India.”The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19With this move, the multiple-entry life-long visas given to OCI card holders has also been restored which was temporarily suspended due to the travel restrictions.OCI cardholders were among several categories of people who have been eagerly awaiting permission to travel to the country. The government officials had earlier this month indicated that their first priority was to meet the minimum expectations of Indian nationals stranded abroad before requests from OCI card holders could be entertained. In line with the thinking, only those categories with an immediate need to travel have been picked from among the OCI card holders. According to the government data, close to 200,000 Indian nationals have registered with the foreign affairs ministry seeking to return to the country and the government is prioritizing travel of those with compelling reasons like people who had lost jobs overseas, pregnant women, and other people with medical emergencies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-allows-certain-categories-of-overseas-citizen-of-india-card-holders-stranded-abroad-to-travel-to-india/story-XqmyUWqgecBmKkg0GreBuN.html
22-05-2020||India||Rajasthan cuts mandi charge on sale, purchase of agri produce||Rajasthan government has partially rolled back the 2% farmer welfare fee on the sale and purchase of select agriculture produce, which was imposed on May 5 because of the protests from the agrarian community.Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Thursday directed that farm produce such as jowar, bajra, makka, jeera (cumin) and isabgol, should be charged 50 paise for every Rs 100 instead of the earlier stipulated fee of Rs 2.Similarly, for agricultural produce such as oilseeds, pulses, and wheat on which the mandi tax of Rs 1.60 per Rs 100 was earlier fixed has now been revised to Re 1.Wool has been exempted from the fee, whose receipts will go to a Farmers’ Welfare Fund that has been set up by the state government.The CM took the decision to partially roll back the fee after holding a meeting with representatives of the state’s business bodies on Thursday. He also consulted his cabinet ministers, members of the legislative assembly (MLAs), members of Parliament (MPs) and entrepreneurs before taking the decision.He said that the state government is aware of the problems being faced by the industries and traders due to the imposition of the farmer welfare fee amid the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak. The partial rollback in farmers’ fee is likely to give relief to businessmen and agro-processing industries related to food items, he added.The desert state’s border districts such as Pratapgarh, Jhalawar, Banswara, Jalore, Sirohi, Kota, Baran, Bharatpur, Dhaulpur, and Alwar, would have lower farmers’ fee than neighbouring states and it would facilitate competitive state, Gehlot said.Earlier, the mandi traders went on a five-day strike from May 6 in protest against the state government’s decision to impose a 2% farmer welfare fee under the Rajasthan Agriculture Produce Market Act, 1961 on the sale and purchase of farm produce.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-cuts-mandi-charge-on-sale-purchase-of-agri-produce/story-oUyc6BHsviNDnH3KjklILK.html

22-05-2020||India||Maharashtra recovery rate rises to 28% due to revised discharge policy||Maharashtra health department’s latest data showed that the recovery rate of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patients has risen to 28%, as compared to 16% on May 1 because of the revised discharged policy that was earlier announced by the Union Ministry of Health & Family Welfare (MoH&FW).So far, 11,726 Covid-19 patients in the state have recovered.“Covid-19 recovery rate is improving. On Thursday, 1,408 patients were discharged from hospitals. The mortality rate has also come down to 3.49%, as compared to 4.21% on May 1,” said state health minister Rajesh Tope.Earlier on May 9, the MoH&FW had announced that moderate cases of Covid-19 and pre-symptomatic, mild and very mild cases need not undergo tests before being discharged from hospitals.Avinash Bhondwe, health expert and president of the Indian Medical Association (IMA), Maharashtra, said, “The revised discharge policy has led to an improved recovery rate. However, these patients may have been recovered from Covid-19 but they’re yet to be cured of the viral infection. The state government authorities need to keep a tab on these patients’ health condition for at least the next seven days, and if they fail to do the infection is likely to spread.”Dr. Pradip Awate, the state surveillance officer, said all Covid-19-hit countries are tweaking their policies. “We’re going by the decision of the Union ministry and the Indian Council of Medical Research, who are best equipped to take the call. Besides, studies have proved that after 10 days of the onset of the disease, the virus SARS-CoV-2, which causes Covid-19, may not be that infectious. Symptomatic patients are not active carriers. There’s no need to panic,” he said.On Thursday, Maharashtra reported 2,345 new Covid-19 cases, the fifth day in a row when over 2,000 cases were recorded, taking the overall count to 41,642.Mumbai, the country’s financial hub and the worst-hit city in the country, reported 1,382 new Covid-19 positive cases, as the tally rose to 25,500. Dr. Tatyrao Lahane, director, Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER), claimed that the state is free from community transmission.“We’re waiting for the incubation cycle to end on May 31, and the spike in the number of Covid-19 positive cases are likely to end after that,” he said.On Tuesday, Maharashtra had issued a notification that allowed opening up of more industrial and commercial activities in rural and semi-urban areas, excluding red zones, in a bid to revive the economy that has been roiled by the viral outbreak.At present, the red zones are restricted to 18 civic bodies that have an estimated population of 2.91 crores.On Thursday, the state government also announced the imposition of a price cap for private hospitals treating Covid-19 patients, including on the billing of drugs.Dr. Sudhakar Shinde, chief executive officer (CEO), Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Arogya Yojana, said, “Private hospitals won’t be allowed to charge more than the amount fixed by the state government. Some patients may need costly medicines, but these hospitals can’t charge more than 10% extra. High-end drugs like immunoglobulin, Meropenem, etc., can be charged at the maximum retail price (MRP),” he added.The state government came down on private hospitals after allegations started doing the rounds that many of them were charging exorbitant fees and fleecing unsuspecting Covid-19 patients.The state government has requisitioned to the Union Ministry of Railways for an additional 250 Shramik Special trains after 441 of them had ferried 5.81 lakh migrant workers to their home states.On Thursday, another 61,000 migrant workers returned to their home states by 51 Shramik Special trains. Over two lakh stranded migrants are still waiting to return home.State home minister Anil Deshmukh said that the government has been footing the bills to repatriate migrant workers to their home states. “So far, Rs 12.44 crore has been transferred to district collectors to pay for migrant workers’ rail fares. Earlier, Rs 54.76 crore was released for their transportation cost,” he saidThe state government has also informed rail authorities that inter-district rail travel is prohibited because of a spike in Covid-19 positive cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-recovery-rate-rises-to-28-due-to-revised-discharge-policy/story-e13HpWNPcz181ILdKw0qOJ.html

The meeting is to be held to discuss the prevailing situation in the country amid the coronavirus pandemic, the impact of nationwide lockdown and the government’s announcement of Rs 20 lakh crore stimulus package to revive the economy.The meeting, to be held via video-conferencing, will also discuss the plight of stranded migrant workers, the problems faced by the farmers and the suspension of labour laws in Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled states of Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat.This will be the first meeting of the opposition leaders after the lockdown was enforced across the country on March 25 to contain the Covid-19 pandemic.

22-05-2020||India||As govt orders resumption of air travel, a look at seven bands of pricing for fights||The government has decided to reopen air travel on 383 routes across the country after a two-month gap. It has, however, allowed one-third of the operations beginning May 25.The civil aviation ministry has set limits on fares that airlines can charge in the initial phase of this critical unlocking of swift long-distance travel.Civil aviation minister Hardeep Puri said the government has identified seven bands (or sectors) based on flight durations. The fares - consistent for each band - will be capped till at least August 24. Sector ‘A’ has routes with travel time of less than 40 minutes. This sector includes routes such as Delhi-Chandigarh, Jammu-Srinagar and Patna-Ranchi, among others. Sector ‘B’ has flights with duration of more than 40 minutes up to 60 minutes. This includes flights such as Delhi-Bhopal and Delhi-Lucknow. Sector ‘C’ has flights such as Delhi-Ahmedabad and Delhi-Patna’; whereas Sector ‘D’ includes routes like Delhi-Mumbai, among others. Since Delhi-Mumbai air travel takes around two hours, it has been put under Sector ‘D’.Prominent flights under Sector ‘E’ are Delhi-Chennai and Delhi-Bengaluru. Meanwhile, flights in Sector ‘F’ include Delhi-Kochi and Sector ‘F’ flights such as Delhi-Port Blair.“Earlier, air carriers could put their range (minimum to maximum) on their websites...We want air travel to become affordable. We have set a minimum fare and a maximum fare. For Delhi to Mumbai, the minimum fare will be Rs 3,500 and maximum Rs 10,000,” Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said at the media briefing on Thursday. The government said 40 per cent of the tickets in all bands will be sold at a price less than the mid-point (of the lower and upper limits). In case of a Delhi-Mumbai journey, these tickets will be priced at around Rs 6,700.The move to set fare limits will ensure there is no overcharging by airlines in view of an expected rush of passengers and heightened demand for tickets, Puri said. At the same time, the move to set lower limits is expected to protect carriers from extremely low fares set by competitors.Domestic flights with less than 40-minute duration, like the ones from Delhi to Chandigarh, will have lower and upper limits of Rs 2,000 and Rs 6,000, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) announced later in the day. For flights with duration between 40 and 60 minutes, such as Delhi to Lucknow, the lower and upper fare limits are Rs 2,500 and Rs 7,500.In the next band (60-90 minutes for journeys like the ones between Bengaluru and Mumbai), the lower fare limit is Rs 3,000 and the upper limit is Rs 9,000, the aviation regulator said. Flights between 120 and 150 minutes, including those on major routes such as Delhi-Bengaluru, will have lower and upper limits of Rs 4,500 and Rs 13,000.Those with duration between 150 and 180 minutes (such as Delhi to Imphal), the lower and upper limits are set at Rs 5,500 and Rs 15,700. And finally, for flights with duration between 180 and 210 minutes - like the ones on Delhi-Coimbatore route - the range will be Rs 6,500 and Rs 18,600.The Railways also issued a list of 100 routes of trains that it will operate from June 1, putting in operation popular trains such as Durontos, Sampark Krantis, Jan Shatabdis and Poorva Express.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-govt-orders-resumption-of-air-travel-a-look-at-seven-bands-of-pricing-for-fights/story-51jIzWAR0v1sOMIj9mkYUO.html

22-05-2020||India||AIIMS to study how long coronavirus can survive in dead bodies||AIIMS doctors are contemplating autopsy of a COVID-19 victim to study how long the coronavirus can survive in a dead body and if it can transmit the infection, the Delhi hospital’s forensic chief said on Thursday.The study will also help ascertain how the virus affects the organs, Dr Sudhir Gupta said.An informed consent will be obtained from the legal heirs of the deceased for it, he said adding that many more departments like pathology and microbiology would be involved in the study.  “It is going to be a first-of-its-kind exercise and thus has to be planned meticulously. It will help us understand how the virus behaves in the body and the way it affects the organs. Also, it will help us assess how long the novel coronavirus can survive in a dead body,” Dr Gupta explained.On Tuesday, the apex health research body ICMR said COVID-19 is a respiratory infection and mainly spread through aerosols.As per the available scientific literature till now, the survival of virus gradually decreases with time in a dead body but there is no specific time limit to declare the body non-infective.  So, it is advisable to adopt precautions and non-invasive autopsy technique, it stated.Non-invasive autopsy technique as described in ICMR guidelines should be used, if at all required, to prevent the risk of spreading the infection to mortuary staff, police personnel and contamination of mortuary surfaces.“If autopsy surgeon feels that he will not be able to conclude cause of death or any other related issue without dissection, then he can proceed with minimal invasive/limited internal dissection.“However, the dissection has to be performed keeping in mind that the conduction of autopsy is a high risk procedure which is potentially as hazardous as any other procedure performed on the body of a COVID-19 patient,” the guidelines said.The Indian Council of Medical Research said limited studies have been conducted on postmortem samples of patients who died due to COVID-19.Most of the pathological studies are in consensus with the clinical features and clinical course of the disease in general. But the disease also gives pathological damages to organs like heart, liver, kidney, brain, blood vessels and other organs, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aiims-to-study-how-long-coronavirus-can-survive-in-dead-bodies/story-yXBJiOYr62wgqD45eV5PkO.html

The leopard was trapped in a fencing wire.This was the second such incident in Kumaon within a week and fourth leopard death in last two weeks in the state.“On getting information from locals, we rushed to the spot and found that a one-year-old leopard was trapped in farm wire near Kunjgadi nullah in the Kapkot area of Bageshwar district. Our team tranquilised it, and brought it to range office after rescue operation but veterinarian declared it brought dead,” said Manish Kumar, range officer, Kapkot in Bageshwar.People of the area alerted Kapot municipality chairman Govind Singh Bisht after seeing the trapped leopard near Kunjgadi nullah. Bisht then informed forest officers about the trapped animal. By the time they reached the spot, the leopard was already unconscious due to severe injuries, an official said.It was brought to the range office where the veterinary doctor declared it brought dead. Its body was burnt by forest officials after post-mortem, said Kumar.This the second case that a leopard was trapped in farm fencing wire. In a similar incident, a leopard was found trapped in Bajaili village of Someshwar in Almora on May 14. Forest officials rescued it and brought it to the rescue centre in Almora. After its treatment, the leopard was released in a natural habitat.On Tuesday, carcass of a leopard was found near the roadside in Almora district’s Chaukhutiya area.

The police said that the man hanged himself on Thursday morning.He was working at a hotel in Mumbai and had managed to come back to his native place Moodabidri after inter-state travel was allowed, the police said.However, since he had come from a different state, the 51-year-old was put into mandatory institutional quarantine functioning at a school. The police said that he was stressed about his employment prospects due to the Covid-19 lockdown and that appears to be the reason why he killed himself.The man is survived by three daughters and a wife. His body has been shifted to the district government hospital for post-mortem and police have launched an investigation.This is the second instance of a person under quarantine killing themselves. In a similar incident on April 27, a 50-year-old Covid-19 positive patient had leapt to death from the third floor of a hospital where he was being treated.Meanwhile, there is growing opposition by residents of various localities in Karnataka where quarantine facilities are set-up. On Wednesday, residents of Bapujinagar in Shivamoga had attacked a hostel, which had been designated as a quarantine facility for those coming back from Mumbai, destroying furniture and other equipment.Earlier, residents of Giringar in Bengaluru and Anekal on the outskirts of the city had staged similar protests. Their main concern was that infected people may spread the disease among the people of that area. However, a health department official said this kind of NIMBY (not in my back yard) pheonomenon was not acceptable and while government would strive to ensure that it took all precautions, people cannot take law into their hands.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/men-sent-to-covid-19-quarantine-allegedly-commits-suicide-in-karnataka/story-LyReNyvdIabzw84TZt7fhP.html
22-05-2020||India||PM Modi to step out after 83 days, his first visit is cyclone-hit Bengal and Odisha||Prime Minister Narendra Modi is going to West Bengal and Odisha on Friday to take stock of the damage caused by Cyclone Amphan, which ravaged the states on Wednesday. PM Modi will conduct an aerial survey of the damage.The Prime Minister is stepping out after almost three months, officials said. His last tour was to Prayagraj and Chitrakoot in Uttar Pradesh on February 29.The Prime Minister had announced a nationwide lockdown in March due to the coronavirus pandemic which has gripped India and the world. He had urged people to stay wherever they are. The lockdown has since been extended thrice, and PM Modi has not stepped out.But this is like a national emergency, which is why the PM has decided to step out after 83 days, said officials. He will go to Kolkata and 24 North Parganas in West Bengal, they said.“He will conduct aerial surveys and take part in review meetings, where aspects of relief and rehabilitation will be discussed,” the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) said in a tweet on Thursday night.Cyclone Amphan has left 72 people dead and thousands homeless in West Bengal, battering several parts of the state and washing away bridges and swamping low-lying areas.It also wreaked havoc in Odisha damaging power and telecom infrastructure in several coastal districts.The extremely severe cyclonic storm has weakened and moved to Bangladesh, the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) said.News of PM Modi’s decision came hours after West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee pitched for central assistance and appealed to PM Modi to visit the cyclone-hit areas. The state government had moved out five lakh people to shield them from the cyclone that roared into the state on Wednesday, packing winds gusting to a top speed of 185 kmph.Earlier on Thursday, PM Modi assured West Bengal that the country stands in solidarity with it as the state counts its losses in the wake of cyclone Amphan.“Have been seeing visuals from West Bengal on the devastation caused by Cyclone Amphan. In this challenging hour, the entire nation stands in solidarity with West Bengal. Praying for the well-being of the people of the state. Efforts are on to ensure normalcy, Prime Minister Modi said in a tweet.PM Modi would first reach West Bengal in the morning and then go to Odisha in the afternoon, news agency PTI reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/national-emergency-officials-on-pm-modi-s-decision-to-tour-cyclone-hit-areas/story-X20Goku0rBOvBnXf32RpJI.html

22-05-2020||India||Delhiwale | Making a new city your home||A great many of our fellow citizens, who came to this city years ago to make a living, are now rushing back to their impoverished villages, often through desperate means. This reverse migration was triggered by the sudden closure of all work (and hence employment) inherent to the prolonged lockdown caused by the coronavirus pandemic. But this young man with a stylish haircut is a fresh arrival from his village to our city.“I came to Delhi a few months ago.... just before the lockdown began,” says Sunny Kumar. A security guard, he is manning the gates of a south Delhi neighbourhood. At 18, this is Mr Kumar’s first ever job in life. On this uncomfortably hot afternoon, he’s standing out quite starkly from a couple of other guards on duty with him. There’s something about his brooding demeanour— a kind of magnetic stage presence hard to miss. And then there’s the matter of his haircut, so attention-grabbing. Running his fingers through his hair as if suddenly conscious of them, Mr Kumar blushes, confessing that “It’s a new style... I got it after arriving in Delhi.”The young man, who finished school last year, reveals he never aspired to become a guard. “I left my village (in Nalanda, Bihar) for a job, any job, due to the conditions at home”—he uses the Hindi word ‘paristhiti’. His father is paralytic, he says matter-of-factly. The eldest among four siblings, “I felt it was my responsibility to look after the family and to lessen the burden my mother was experiencing in running the household.”He knew quite a few people of his village working in Delhi, and so he easily landed up with the current job through this precious network of acquaintances. “I decided to start this life in Delhi after giving it a lot of thought,” he mutters.Mr Kumar is now sufficiently established to be able to send money frequently to home. He lives in Tughlakabad and is full of plans for his future.“After some months I will try to enrol in a college for graduation,” he says, as another guard, his colleague in mask, listens to him intently. “Ultimately, I want to join the army.”And now he reveals another dream of his. Raising his eyes towards the interlocutor, he declares a tad hesitantly, “I also intend to get modelling assignments.” Having said this, he looks almost relieved and helps himself to a bottle of water kept inside the guard’s cabin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhiwale-making-a-new-city-your-home/story-6x2mQNn1aL6YMeVw8ByawL.html
22-05-2020||India||Release buyers’ loans: Receiver in Amrapali housing case urges SC||The court receiver appointed for execution of the Amrapali group housing projects has urged the Supreme Court to issue urgent orders to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for an advisory asking all banks and financial institutions to disburse balance loan amounts to Amrapali homebuyers to ensure availability of funds for completion of stalled projects. The special bench of the apex court will take up the receiver’s note for hearing on Friday. The Supreme Court has been monitoring the execution and handover of the stalled Amrapali housing projects ever since an internal audit report, commissioned by the Court, found grave irregularities on part of Amrapali firms and its directors. The court appointed senior advocate R Venkatramani as the receiver to pursue the completion of the stalled projects and ensure timely completion and handover to the homebuyers.Venkatramani informed the Supreme Court in his note that as on date, funds to complete the housing projects had to come from the sale of unsold housing inventories, sale of other Amrapali properties, and balance receivables on sold units from homebuyers who have taken loans.The note, a copy of which is with the HT, pegs funds from sale of 5,228 unsold inventories at approximately Rs 2220.45 crore, funds from sale of other Amrapali properties, attached or otherwise, at Rs 500 crore, bank loans to homebuyers and balance accruing on sold units at approximately Rs 3,870.4 crore, and receivables from unsold units at Rs 213.46 crore.Meanwhile, advocate ML Lahoty, assisting the Court on behalf of homebuyers, has submitted a separate note to the court, claiming that funds accruing from sale of other assets belonging to Amrapali group come to more than Rs 7,881 crore, instead of Rs 500 crore estimated.Venkatramni said: “I will offer my comment on Friday on this.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/release-buyers-loans-receiver-in-amrapali-housing-case-urges-sc/story-Sr98ztrh0VwbKk0aCNEWJI.html
22-05-2020||India||Beyond the news: Opening of air travel may end the dilemma over meetings of parliamentary panels||In the past decade, Parliament met, on an average, for little over two months per year to transact legislative business and debate key issues. That obviously is too short a period for members of either House to come to grips, in any meaningful manner, with legislations and other matters of import.What couldn’t be realised in open sessions of the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha was made possible through the department related standing committees (DRSCs) that were Parliament’s microcosm. Their in-camera proceedings provided members the requisite relief from public glare to rise above partisan political/party interests for reaching consensus or broad agreements, on the stickiest of issues. Democracy indeed worked better in these miniature groups.In normal times, the parliamentary panels, especially the DRSCs, met through the year, deliberating on a host of issues, especially Bills and budgetary demands of various ministries and departments. The nationwide lockdown that began on March 25 hit these panels the hardest, their “core contribution” power-braked by the absence of committee members, many of whom were confined to their home constituencies and states.The March 25 countrywide closure Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced to contain the Covid-19 pandemic was enforced two days after Parliament curtailed its Budget Session. After the initial view that cutting short the session could demoralise the people in general, and the doctors and paramedics in particular, such was the alarm triggered by the medical emergency that the all important Finance Bill, 2020 was passed without any debate in the Lok Sabha.It was against this backdrop that RS chairman Venkaiah Naidu and LS Speaker Om Birla met on May 7, the 44th day of the lockdown to look for ways to put the committee-work back on rails. They followed up those confabulations with another meeting on May 18 — the 55th day of the shutdown marked by substantial easing of the initial restrictions.In their first meeting, Naidu and Birla had asked secretaries general of the two Houses to explore the possibility of DRSC meetings through video-conferencing. The SGs have since reverted to the presiding officers, pointing out “serious” technical and security issues in e-linking members stationed in different states, a person familiar with the discussions told this writer. The other glitch is that Parliament’s general purposes committee might have to be co-opted as the matter falls in its jurisdiction. That committee too is of members from both Houses who will have to discuss the matter online.The nearly two dozen DRSCs were institutionalised in 1993 to help parliamentarians understand the complexities of governance. They generally have as members 21 LS MPs and 10 from the Upper House who meet under a designated chairperson. They are the platforms to which officials are summoned for clarifications to enhance the members’ understanding of the subjects under discussion. It is that element in their work that brings up the security aspect on which there’s little scope to take chances. At their last meeting on Monday, the presiding officers were nevertheless sanguine that DRSCs could resume work in the event of air travel opening on the conclusion of lockdown 4.0 on May 31 or anytime thereafter. A plain reading of the Lok Sabha’s Rule 266 — which says the meetings have to be held in private — also puts the balance in favour of regular interactions as opposed to online discussions. If that regimen is possible, it’ll at once obviate the logistical and confidentiality pitfalls.Aside from removing bottlenecks to make DRSCs functional, there’s the challenge of holding Parliament’s Monsoon session — generally scheduled in July — while ensuring social distancing in the LS-RS chambers where the seating arrangements are too cluttered to meet the post-Covid standards.The Parliament was adjourned sine die on March 23. As per the Constitution’s Article 85(I), it has to meet before the expiry of six months. That leaves scope for delaying the Monsoon sitting — but issues relating to the seating plans will remain.The summoning of Parliament is in the Government’s domain. Yet, a veteran MP chose to think aloud. He suggested, on conditions of anonymity, that if the pandemic persists, the 245 member Rajya Sabha could meet in the larger Lok Sabha chamber and the latter could shift to the spacious Central Hall. Doable though they may seem, such improvisations to reopen our democracy’s highest temple require wider consultations and agreement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/beyond-the-news-reconvening-house-panels-a-tough-task/story-eZ1UyHnkxpFMTxNv4UwkaI.html
22-05-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||India is moving again.On Wednesday, the civil aviation ministry announced the resumption of flights, and on Thursday, it came out with the details. There won’t be as many flights as there were before the lockdown – just around a third – and the government will define the range for ticket prices. On the Delhi-Mumbai route, which is India’s busiest one, for instance, the minimum fare will be Rs 3,500 and the maximum Rs 10,000. There’s a further requirement – that 40% of the tickets be sold at the median price of Rs 6,700.On Tuesday, Indian Railways announced it would run 100 (pairs of) trains, adding to the Shramik trains it is running to ferry stranded migrant workers back home, and the special trains it is running from Delhi to 15 cities and back. On Wednesday, it released the list of trains. The flights will start from May 25 and the trains from June 1.The resumption of air and rail services comes as India is slowly easing stringent lockdown rules that were issued on March 25 as the first phase of the lockdown began. That has been extended three times, and we are currently in Lockdown 4.0 as some have started referring to it, although the current phase is more of a graded exit than a continuation of restrictions. This phase ends on May 31.RESUMING AIR, RAIL TRAVELThe resumption of air and rail services comes as India slowly eases stringent lockdown rules that were first issued on March 25. The developments come even as the number of Covid-19 cases continues to rise in India.The resumption of air and train services comes even as the number of Covid-19 cases continues to rise – India added 5,830 infections to end Thursday with a total of 116,726 cases. The government has come under criticism from some quarters for imposing too harsh and too prolonged a lockdown, and from others for lifting the lockdown just as cases are beginning to peak.Perhaps in response to that, the Press Information Bureau put out a release on Thursday defending the government and showcasing numbers that prove that the lockdown has been used to prepare for the crisis. The release refers to 3,027 dedicated Covid-19 hospitals, 6.5 million personal protective equipment kits and 10.1 million N95 masks supplied to the states, and the daily manufacture of 300,000 PPE kits and a like number of N95 masks.The number of Covid-19 cases was never going to drop to zero by mid-May as a government presentation showed; it was always clear that a lockdown would reduce the number of cases (there is no doubt that India’s has), and delay the peak (more on this shortly) – providing enough time for the State to prepare. EXITING THE LOCKDOWNThe imminent lifting of the lockdown is an indication that India believes it is now equipped to deal with the worst the pandemic can throw at it, or that it believes the economic cost of the lockdown is now far too high, or both.The imminent lifting of the lockdown – even if this takes the form of a fifth phase with even more easing of restrictions – is an indication that India believes it is now equipped to deal with the worst the pandemic can throw at it, or that it believes the economic cost of the lockdown is now far too high, or both.But what about the peak? When will it come? India has added 52.23% of its cases (as on May 20) since May 5. While the current drivers of the number – Maharashtra, Delhi, Gujarat, and Tamil Nadu – may well start seeing a reduction in the number of daily cases, it is likely new drivers will emerge, spurred by the mass movement of migrants and stranded Indians back home, or just by the natural progression of the pandemic.WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?While states that are driving India’s spike in Covid-19 tally may see a reduction in the number of daily new cases, it is likely that new drivers will emerge, spurred by mass movement of migrants and stranded Indians back home, or just by the natural progression of the disease.Some of the ensuing Covid-19 infections will be mild, and some may be asymptomatic, but overall, the number of cases will continue to rise and may peak only in July, according to Dr SK Sarin, the chair of the Delhi chief minister’s committee on Covid-19 preparedness.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-mrsuXVfyvx6m7bQfEw8Z7J.html
22-05-2020||India||West Bengal, Odisha flooded as cyclone Amphan wreaks havoc||Cyclone Amphan killed at least 72 people and left a trail of destruction and damage in West Bengal, where rescue teams on Thursday struggled to reach ruined coastal hamlets that bore the brunt of the storm’s fury before it moved on to neighbouring Bangladesh.The toll in India from the cyclone, including the two dead in Odisha on Wednesday, stood at 74 at the time of going to print. The loss of life may have been much more had it not been for the evacuation of 658,000 people -- 500,000 in West Bengal and 158,000 in Odisha -- before the cyclone arrived. Those moved to relief camps have been asked not to step out or return to their homes for fear that they may come in contact with high-tension electric cables that have snapped and be electrocuted.WATCH | Cyclone Amphan leaves trail of destruction in Odisha & West BengalThe death toll included 15 who died in Kolkata. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee said most of the 72 deaths had been caused by electrocution and falling trees. The deceased in Odisha were a two-month-old baby and a woman. In Bangladesh, initial reports said that 10 people were killed.“Several districts have been totally ruined. We never thought that it would be so destructive,” Banerjee said as her government tried to arrive at an estimate of the damage done by Amphan, the most powerful storm to have originated in the Bay of Bengal since the 1999 Odisha super cyclone that killed 9,000 people.“Two districts – North and South 24 Parganas -- are completely devastated. We have to rebuild those districts from scratch. I would urge the central government to extend all help to the state,” said Banerjee, who is likely to visit the devastated districts on Saturday for a spot assessment of the destruction.The state government announced compensation of Rs 2.5 lakh for the families of those killed in the cyclone. Banerjee also announced a relief package of Rs 1,000 crore after meeting members of a task force formed to assess relief work needed in the aftermath of cyclone Amphan. Large parts of West Bengal including many areas in Kolkata and its surrounding areas went without electricity on Thursday and telecom disruptions made it difficult for the state government to contact district headquarters for an assessment of the situation, including the number of people displaced by the cyclone. Officials said that in some districts it could take three days to restore power supply. “Not all the district magistrates could be contacted on Thursday. Those who we could contact have been asked to send a list of immediate requirements which we can send,” West Bengal chief secretary Rajiva Sinha told reporters at the state secretariat. Banerjee said she had requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi to visit the cyclone-hit areas, adding that home minister Amit Shah had called her and assured her of help. Banerjee said help should arrive fast and not after 500 days. “We haven’t received any money to fight the Covid-19 pandemic till date,” the CM said.The storm, which made landfall around 20km east of Sagar Island in the Sunderbans on Wednesday afternoon, packing winds gusting to a top speed of 185 kilometres per hour, cut off road links, snapped telecommunications and left parts of West Bengal without electricity. It flattened houses, uprooted trees and power pylons, causing rivers to swell and breach their embankments. It hit Kolkata at a wind speed of 130km per hour. Reuters Television footage shot in West Bengal showed upturned boats on the shore, people wading through knee-deep water and buses crashed into each other. More images showed villagers trying to lift fallen electricity poles, fishermen hauling their boats out of a choppy sea, and uprooted trees lying strewn across the countryside.“Have been seeing visuals from West Bengal on the devastation caused by Cyclone Amphan. In this challenging hour, the entire nation stands in solidarity with West Bengal. Praying for the well-being of the people of the state. Efforts are on to ensure normalcy,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted on Thursday.Designated a super cyclone, Amphan has weakened since making landfall. Moving inland through Bangladesh, it was downgraded to a cyclonic storm on Thursday by the Indian weather office. The storm was expected to subside into a depression later.The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) said on Thursday that the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) “climatological intelligence” was accurate and helped in saving lives while minimising damage.IMD used a doppler weather radar (monitoring tool for severe weather) on the east and west coasts to come up with an accurate cyclone track with near-accurate wind speed and landfall point predictions. IMD’s director general, M Mohapatra, said: “This shows India can face cyclones and can save life and property.” NDRF director general SN Pradhan said Odisha may bounce back to normalcy in the next 24 to 48 hours. The West Bengal government has sought four more NDRF teams which are being airlifted from Chennai and Pune, he said. “Restoration work has started from late last night. If more teams needed, we can deploy more,” said Pradhan adding that the overall damage has not yet been assessed and the death toll may change as reports from the ground start coming in.Concern was, meanwhile, growing over flooding in the Sundarbans, an ecologically fragile region straddling the India-Bangladesh border, best known for thick mangrove forests and its tiger reserve.“The tidal surge submerged some part of the forest,” said Belayet Hossain, a forest official on the Bangladesh side of the forest. “We have seen trees uprooted, the tin roofs of the guard towers blown off,” he said.Over on the Indian side of the Sundarbans, a village official said embankments surrounding a low-lying island, where some 5,000 people live, had been washed away, and he had been unable to contact authorities for help.“We have not been able inform them about anything since last night, the official, Sanjib Sagar, said.(Reuters contributed to this story)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wb-odisha-flooded-as-amphan-wreaks-havoc/story-uvKKGxeCxkJSe2PRiGFYZP.html
22-05-2020||India||India unlocks air travel on 383 routes with new rules||India will reopen air travel on 383 routes across the country after a two-month gap, the government announced on Thursday, but allowed one-third of the operations beginning May 25 and set limits on fares that airlines can charge in the initial phase of this critical unlocking of swift long-distance travel.Civil aviation minister Hardeep Puri said the government has identified seven bands based on flight durations, while announcing a set of norms for airlines and guidelines for passengers that outline how air travel is set to change in India in the aftermath of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak.The fares — consistent for each band — will be capped till at least August 24.“[Because of the lockdown] we have been able to escape the situation other countries have found themselves in. [But] it is equally important that at some stage you will have to open up. Two months is a very long time...you have to balance between lives and livelihood; it is time to now open up,” Puri said at a press conference in New Delhi, a day after announcing the resumption of domestic flights.According to data by Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), flights in the first phase will operate on all routes, taking off from a total of 35 origin cities and landing in 39 destination airports.“The central government hereby directs that domestic civil flight operations are permitted from 25 May, 2020 to a limited extent... For operations from Metro to Metro cities, One-Third capacity of the approved Summer Schedule...,” the civil aviation ministry said in an order on Thursday. The metro cities were identified as Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Chennai, Hyderabad and Kolkata. The rule will be applicable for metro to non-metro operations as well.Though there are several guidelines for social distancing in airports and at embarkation and disembarkation points, the middle seat will not be kept vacant in the aircraft. Lancelot Pinto, an epidemiologist at Mumbai’s Hinduja Hospital, said social distancing should be a priority. “Even though the government is saying they will scan each passengers, many of the travellers will not show any symptoms as almost 80% people (Covid-19 patients) are asymptomatic.” Puri, however, said it was not possible to keep the middle seat vacant. “This is not an option being followed by any other country as well. We will keep our fingers crossed,” he said.The seven bands identified by the government are: flights with duration of less than 40 minutes (Sector A), those with journey time of 40-60 minutes (Sector B), 60-90 minutes (Sector C), 90-120 minutes (Sector D), 120-150 minutes (Sector E), 150-180 minutes (Sector F) and 180-210 minutes (Sector G).A Delhi-Mumbai air travel takes around two hours, putting it in the category of Sector D. “Earlier, air carriers could put their range (minimum to maximum) on their websites...We want air travel to become affordable. We have set a minimum fare and a maximum fare. For Delhi to Mumbai, the minimum fare will be Rs 3,500 and maximum Rs 10,000,” Puri said at the media briefing.The government said 40% of the tickets in all bands will be sold at a price less than the mid-point (of the lower and upper limits). In case of a Delhi-Mumbai journey, these tickets will be priced at around Rs 6,700. The move to set fare limits will ensure there is no overcharging by airlines in view of an expected rush of passengers and heightened demand for tickets, Puri said. At the same time, the move to set lower limits is expected to protect carriers from extremely low fares set by competitors.Domestic flights with less than 40-minute duration, like the ones from Delhi to Chandigarh, will have lower and upper limits of Rs 2,000 and Rs 6,000, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) announced later in the day. For flights with duration between 40 and 60 minutes, such as Delhi to Lucknow, the lower and upper fare limits are Rs 2,500 and Rs 7,500. In the next band (60-90 minutes for journeys like the ones between Bengaluru and Mumbai), the lower fare limit is Rs 3,000 and the upper limit is Rs 9,000, the aviation regulator said. Flights between 120 and 150 minutes, including those on major routes such as Delhi-Bengaluru, will have lower and upper limits of Rs 4,500 and Rs 13,000. Those with duration between 150 and 180 minutes (such as Delhi to Imphal), the lower and upper limits are set at Rs 5,500 and Rs 15,700. And finally, for flights with duration between 180 and 210 minutes — like the ones on Delhi-Coimbatore route — the range will be Rs 6,500 and Rs 18,600.Vistara welcomed the moved to resume domestic flights, which were grounded on March 25, the day restrictions were first imposed in the country.“Aviation is a growth engine for the economy and resumption of air travel will give great impetus to the government’s overall efforts in helping the country eventually return to normalcy,” Vistara CEO Leslie Thng said. Global airlines’ body International Air Transport Association (IATA), a grouping of 290 airlines, said the decision to regulate airfares is a “step back”. Private carriers such as Air India, Vistara, IndiGo and SpiceJet are its members. “Airlines need to have the freedom to make their commercial decisions, including the pricing of airfares. Hence, we recognise and hope that this is a one-time measure as a result of Covid-19 and will be discontinued on August 24,” IATA assistant director (corporate communications - Asia Pacific) Albert Tjoeng told news agency PTI.Ravi Kini, managing partner at law firm MV Kini & Co, said: “Fares are published by airlines in the regular course. The range normally published is very wide for allowing flexibility for the airlines to respond to the market demand in free market situation. In the current situation, free market play has been curbed due to Covid-19...This is a good move by the government to balance the consumer interests with airline profitability.”(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-unlocks-air-travel-on-383-routes-with-new-rules/story-qz9OO2O37L6U76KSSUhrOP.html
22-05-2020||India||Owner of popular grocery store in Defence Colony tests Covid positive||The owner of a prominent grocery store in Delhi’s popular Defence Colony market has tested positive for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), officials said on Thursday, even as health care workers launched efforts to trace people who may have come in contact with the 53-year-old.Manoj Gupta, the owner of Defence Store in the south Delhi neighbourhood, was admitted to the Max Hospital in Saket on Tuesday after developing flu-like symptoms. He later tested positive for the infectious disease, the Defence Colony residents’ welfare association said. Seven family members of Gupta and three domestic help were later put under home quarantine as a precaution.The grocery store, which carries both domestic and imported brands of various food and daily use items, was operational with social distancing norms through the lockdown, which was necessitated by the Covid-19 outbreak. Gupta’s family has decided to keep the store shut till the test results of all staffers and other family members are out. The Defence Colony Market Association said the neighbourhood market – over time, it has come to be identified as a popular shopping destination – will remain open while adhering to the government’s guidelines. The market reopened on Tuesday after the government allowed a graded relaxation of restrictions under the fourth phase of the lockdown. There are 52 commercial establishments in the market, including restaurants, bakeries, grocery stores and chemists.Gupta’s family said he did not visit any location other than the store during the movement restrictions, which have effectively been in place since March 22. “We don’t know how he got the infection. He did not go anywhere except the store. Our test reports are expected to arrive on Friday. The store’s three staff members have also been tested at RML Hospital for Covid-19 and the reports are likely to come in a day or two. We will not reopen the store till all the reports return negative. We have already got the store sanitised and will get it disinfected multiple times before opening,” said Pramod Gupta, Manoj Gupta’s brother.The Delhi government and district administration could not be immediately contacted for a comment regarding tracing Gupta’s contacts over the past few days.As news of Gupta’s test result broke, residents began calling the area councillor, Seema Mallik, to have the market disinfected. The colony has over 4,800 housing units spread over five blocks, with a sizeable population of retired government and armed forces personnel.Mallik said: “I have got calls from residents and the market association, and will get the entire market sanitised.”Gaurav Dhingra, owner of Defence Bakery, said they were trying to spread awareness about the disease among customers. “We have been taking all necessary precautions from the beginning. We should not get scared because somebody has tested for the disease here. Rather, we should be supportive and not stigmatise the person and family. We have already asked our customers to wear masks and gloves. Only two customers are allowed inside at a time. We are encouraging contactless payments,” he said.The market association has asked owners of all shops in the area to ensure social distancing inside their stores. “I have asked owners to display products on tables outside the stores, to ensure social distancing inside the shop,” said Rajinder Malik, president, Defence Colony market association.Major (retd) Ranjit Singh, president of the Defence Colony residents’ welfare association, said: “So far, we don’t know how he contracted the virus. District health officials have sanitised Gupta’s residence, his shop and the rest of the market. We will ensure the family gets all the necessary help.”Singh sent a message to residents in the colony on Wednesday, informing them about the positive test, and appealing to them not to blame Gupta for contracting the disease or trying to bully the family.Customers of the popular store also appealed that the owner and his family not be stigmatised. “We should support them. It’s fine to visit the store taking all precautions necessary,” said Abhay Sharma, who works in an IT firm in Gurugram, and is a regular customer.Riya Mittal, a Delhi University student who was at Defence Bakery on Thursday, said: “Thousands of people have tested positive in Delhi now. We will have to keep going taking all precautions.”With the government relaxing the curbs of the lockdown, medical experts say people have to learn to live with the virus. “There is no need to panic or worry. We can’t sanitise all places because there are so many people who are asymptomatic. People should just follow basic precautions,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of epidemiology and communicable diseases at the Indian Council of Medical Research.Now that people are stepping out for work, Dr Jugal Kishore, head of community medicine at Safdarjung hospital, said: “The only thing we can do is take precautions like ensuring social distancing and frequently washing our hands and wearing a mask.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/owner-of-popular-grocery-store-in-defence-colony-tests-covid/story-h7u1L3GttcsZO4IurATBFK.html
22-05-2020||India||‘Covid-19 peak likely in July-August’: Dr SK Sarin||Dr SK Sarin, director of the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences, who also heads the five-member committee formed to assist the Delhi chief minister to tackle the pandemic, spoke to Hindustan Times about the importance of antibody testing, community surveillance, and the way forward for the Capital.Community transmission is when an infection has occurred in the absence of history of travel or a known contact, which is likely to happen now in view of the large migrant labour movement and also easing of the lockdown.People are scared of the term community transmission. But this has occurred in almost all the countries and is likely to be there even at present here.The lockdown has only delayed the peak, which is likely to come maybe in July or mid-August.At present, the country is seeing an ascent in the number of Covid-19 cases. It will remain so as long as the reproductive number is more than 1 (meaning each infected person transmits the virus to more than one person). The plateau will come only when one person infects one person, the decline will start when one person is infecting say 0.5.We are already in the second scenario that the committee had talked about of 500 cases being reported in a day. And, Delhi is prepared for the third scenario of 1,000 cases being reported in a day as well.It is really one of better controlled and monitored cities with a very well organised reporting and testing system. We are doing almost 5,000 tests a day now, which was anticipated for this scenario. And, it can go up to even 10,000 when required.Delhi is doing well but it is a very vulnerable city due to movement of people from other states. And it will remain a vulnerable state for a year or year-and-a-half. The people of Delhi will have to be extra cautious.Ideally, the lockdown should have lasted 12 weeks as we learnt from Wuhan, China but we had it for about nine weeks. I think it was only possible and people were accepting of it because it was done in an incremental manner.We have to be extra-cautious for a surge in cases mainly because of the travelling migrant workers and slightly early easing of the lockdown restrictions. There will be a surge but is acceptable. The numbers are not a cause of concern, the deaths are.Also, at any given time in a community 30 – 50% is the hidden number of cases. So, as a way forward I strongly suggest that antibody tests be done.Today’s green zones are probably the most dangerous zones for tomorrow because there is no exposure in people living in these areas and they will drive the future waves of infections. Today, red zones are probably better because more people have been silently exposed and they would have developed the antibodies to fight off the infection.Now, to understand whether a red zone can be more open tomorrow or a green zone become restricted we need to do antibody testing. It will help us identify the areas where we have to pay more attention next month or the month after.Our testing strategy needs to improve. And that would include making the swab tests available at all major hospitals rather than the samples being sent to certain specified labs.Delhi is already doing about 5,000 tests a day and this can be increased up to 10,000.Apart from the RT-PCR {Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction} nasal swab test, our testing strategy will have to include blood antigen test. If you are going to test a large population, the test has to be cheap, rapid and feasible. The current nasal swab tests are not that friendly and feasible.It should be available in the next few weeks’ time. Plus, we also need the antibody test like I have said earlier.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lockdown-has-only-delayed-the-peak-dr-sk-sarin/story-8igm2aPjRM3Ndd1WNKAshM.html
22-05-2020||India||Railways allow opening of ticket counters at select stations||The Indian Railways has allowed re-opening of reservation counters at select stations and booking through Common Service Centers (CSCs) and agents, the ministry of railways said Thursday.“ Opening of all these booking facilities once again will mark an important step in the graded restoration of passenger railway services and making the task of ticket booking easy for all prospective travelers from all parts of India in reserved trains. Zonal railways may adhere to standard social distancing guidelines and observe the hygiene protocols in view of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic,” the ministry said.Booking of train tickets will resume at around 1.7 lakh common service centres across the country from Friday onward, Union railway minister Piyush Goyal also said on Thursday. Railways will also allow booking at counters across the station soon, Goyal said. This will make the service accessible to those in remote locations. The minister said bookings will also resume at counters at specific railway stations over the next two to three days.Zonal Railways have been instructed to decide and notify the opening of reservation counters in a phased manner on Friday along with dissemination of information about their locations and timings as per local needs and conditions. “ We will announce resumption of more trains. It is time to take India towards normalcy. We are developing a protocol to identify the stations where counters can be opened. We have to ensure that there are no large crowds gathering at counters to book tickets, so we are studying the situation and devising a protocol towards it,” Goyal said.Goyal was speaking at an interaction with BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra on Thursday. Railways on Tuesday announced it will run 200 special passenger trains a day from June 1 and online ticket booking was scheduled to open Thursday.Goyal said within 2.5 hours of opening bookings for the 100 pairs of special trains on Thursday, four lakh passengers had booked tickets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rlys-allow-opening-of-ticket-counters-at-select-stations/story-WH0nwICHp0DT0gXujCerQL.html
22-05-2020||India||Vaccination at birth must continue in all hospitals in all zones: Health ministry||Vaccination at birth will continue in hospitals or clinics irrespective of the categorisation of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) containment zone, the Union health ministry said in an advisory on immunisation issued on Thursday.While in other cases, providing vaccination doses as per the schedule will only be allowed outside the containment and buffer zones, and in green zones. In containment and buffer zones no outreach programme is allowed to be conducted to mobilise the target population; however people who walk-into a health facility to get their child vaccinated should not be turned away, and adequate precautionary measures must be taken during the process.The advisory was issued amid fears that immunisation services were being entirely stalled, putting young children at risk of contracting vaccine preventable illnesses that could become life-threatening.As a standard practice, immunisation services are delivered through the following modes: birth dose vaccination in health facilities where the child is born and another option is for walk-in immunisation sessions at fixed health facilities such as district hospitals, community health centres, primary health centres or sub-centres etc.Doctors say while vaccination at birth will not be a problem it is the other doses that need to be carefully planned.“Vaccination at birth means that you are likely to be in a hospital, and it won’t require an extra visit. The next vaccination is usually six weeks onwards, and in the first six months at least three visits will be required. For a reasonable period it can be delayed but not indefinitely. Since Covid is here to stay, there’s a need to plan better for the remaining doses after discussing with the doctor such as instead of going to a hospital where other patients are also going to be present, people can opt for vaccine clinics,” says Dr Nitin Verma, senior pediatrician, Max Healthcare. Under government of India’s universal immunisation programme (UIP), vaccines are given for 12 diseases to protect children and pregnant mothers from vaccine preventable diseases (VPDs).“No active mobilisation to the health facility be carried out; every opportunity is to be utilized for vaccinating beneficiaries if they have already reported at the facilities; ensure social distancing and hand washing etc., to be adopted at health facility level for vaccinating the pregnant women and children who have reported to these facilities,” says the health ministry directive.The list of areas under containment zone and buffer zone in a district is updated on weekly basis. Any area exiting a containment or buffer zone can start facility based and outreach immunisation activities as in areas ‘beyond buffer zone’ after a minimum gap of 14 days.“In the context of Covid-19 outbreak, for delivery of immunisations services for different zones health facilities will adequately follow guidelines from ministry of home affairs and ministry of health pertaining to Covid-19 that will be the primary reference points… practices of social distancing, hand washing, and respiratory hygiene in all sessions; birth dose vaccination at health facilities would continue irrespective of zones… the State and District administration should make a local assessment of Covid-19 risk before starting the outreach or health facility-based immunisation with mobilisation of beneficiaries. Similarly, an area enlisted as a ‘containment/ buffer zone’ should stop health facility-based sessions and outreach sessions.” For areas beyond buffer zones, and in green zones, there are no restrictions to be followed, except for taking a call at the local level on the government outreach programmes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccination-at-birth-must-continue-in-all-hospitals-in-all-zones-health-ministry/story-2N14HYE59DEahZHO7kr20L.html
22-05-2020||India||Will meet piped water target despite outbreak: Jal Shakti minister||The coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic has made no difference to India’s stated goal of providing piped water to all households by 2024, Jal Shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat said. In an interview to Hindustan Times, Shekhawat conceded that in some states, it was a challenge to provide water for frequent washing of hands that health experts advise as a way of keeping the virus at bay. He added: “Looking towards the challenge itself, PM had envisaged this programme (Jal Jeevan Mission) . You may call it luxury but we are going to achieve it in the targeted time.” Edited excerpts:Your ministry’s objective has been to provide tap water to all by 2024. Has the coronavirus disease pandemic made any difference to the plan?No, not at all. We are still set for our goals for 2024 and providing functional drinking water to every household. Before this Covid period, we were working hard ever since PM announced this on 15 August from Red Fort. We requested states to collect the low hanging fruits-- villages that already have existing, sustainable sources of water -- could start retrofitting pipes. I can proudly say that we have achieved our goal for the first year. Simultaneously, during the Covid period, the 2.5 months, we were not sitting idle. We repeatedly did meetings with states and ministers. We wanted to use this period to complete the planning for the implementation of this programme. We requested them to make their state execution plan for this year and the remaining three years. So you are completing the theoretical part during the lockdown?Yes and as soon as the construction activity was allowed in Lockdown 2, we asked states to start work as soon as possible. Today, for example, I had meetings with Chattisgarh CM and Madhya Pradesh CM and I have requested CMs to use the Jal Jeevan Mission as a programme to provide employment at the grassroots level. Since each and every village has to be provided piped water, every village will have work for laying pipes, digging trenches, etcetera. MNREGA {Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act} budget has been increased, so we have asked states to utilise that money as well by consolidating funds so you are providing employment and achieving (piped water) targets.So there is a convergence of supply and demand? But your ministry data says only 18% people have piped water right now. So how difficult is it for people to practice washing of hands?It is really challenging, but water was not available as a whole but through the water drinking water programme and work of the states over the years, it was available in the close vicinity. Whether it is in the 50-100 metres and for some other villages, it is a longer distance, but still it was available. We wrote a letter to the states during the lockdown, to ensure sustainable water supply through those public standposts or common sources of water.But practically speaking, it must be a problem. Isn’t it a luxury to be able to wash hands frequently? Especially in states like West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh, which have only 1%, and Biha, which has 2% households with piped water.It is a challenge. Looking towards the challenge itself, PM had envisaged this programme (Jal Jeevan Mission) . You may call it luxury but we are going to achieve it in the targeted time.What do you make of the side effects that we are seeing of the lockdown? Reports that the Ganga has become much cleaner. Do you fear that things will immediately go back as soon as the lockdown ends?There are three visible causes of water pollution--sewage, industrial effluents and third, by human interactions. Out of three, two were closed--industry and the human interactions, due to the lockdown. Because of that there are changes which have been observed in the quality of water but as far as the Ganga is concerned, it’s not a major difference. In the Ganga, in the last Kumbh last year, 22 crore people observed changes in the quality of water. That’s because of the mission mode effort under the PM of Namami Gange. In the month of October- November, we did a rafting expedition from Devprayag to Rishikesh. In those 90 odd kilometres, I just picked up some water from the river in my glass and it was absolutely potable. In this season, as the water comes from melting snow, it appears comparatively better. Similiar position is also in the Yamuna water, there was significant rainfall which increased the water in the river. It was a coincidence that there were untimely rains otherwise we only see sewage in the Yamuna in this period. Water for harvest was also not taken out of the river so quantity of water increased. Looking at the industrial shutdown as an opportunity, Prime Minister instructed us to take samples of the river and use this period as an opportunity to study, how much pollution is contributed through industrial effluence. This can be used for future planning. So how will you use it?We have collected all the data of different stretches of the Yamuna and Ganga during the lockdown period. Now we are able to tell how much pollution is contributed by sewage in the city and how much by industries. So we have tied up with Central Pollution Control Board and also with the IITs {Indian Institutes of Technology} apart from our internal bodies so at the end of it, we’ll have extensive data on this.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-meet-piped-water-target-despite-outbreak-jal-shakti-minister/story-7FH7BFRRGeBKzjgYeQDjMI.html

All the dedicated health facilities together have 281,000 isolation beds, 31,250 intensive care unit (ICU) beds, and 11,387 beds with oxygen support for patients.Health minister Dr. Harsh Vardhan, at an event marking the government’s Ayushman Bharat health insurance scheme reaching 10 million beneficiaries, listed some of India’s achievements. “India has managed to put up a better fight against Covid-19 as compared to many other developed and developing countries. Of the 1 lakh cases, we have sent a significant number (more than 40,000) home after treatment, and most of the remaining 60,000 people are also on the road to recovery. As far as Covid-related deaths are concerned, India has managed to keep the mortality rate also low, as compared to other countries. We are doing fine,” Harsh Vardhan said.India so far has reported over 1,12,000 cases, 45,300 recoveries and 3,435 deaths. When compared with situation globally, health ministry says, India has reported 7.9 cases per 100,000 population as compared to 62 globally. As for deaths, India has reported 0.2 deaths per 100,000 population as compared to 4.2 globally.Even so, some reports have questioned the effectiveness of the lockdown, which confined citizens indoors, shut factories and services not deemed to be essential, including clubs, gymnasiums and entertainment centres. “This is not correct to say. The idea was to work towards improving healt-care services so that all who need treatment get it in time,” said a senior health ministry official, requesting not to be identified. So far, the Centre has supplied 6.5 million personal protection equipment (PPE) coveralls and 10.1 million N-95 masks to the states. From importing most of the PPE components, India has tasked domestic manufacturers with producing them. India is producing nearly 300,000 PPE coveralls and 300,000 N-95 masks each day.“This is a remarkable achievement and was made possible because the government had time to prepare for infrastructure upgrade. The country is fully prepared to manage the situation if the cases were to surge. We are comfortably placed at the moment; there is no need to panic,” the ministry official cited above said. On the surveillance and research front, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has constituted a National Task Force that has held 20 meetings since mid March and is responsible for taking scientific and technical decisions in managing the viral disease.“A well-coordinated approach has been adopted to activate the scientific community of the country and who are contributing by working round the clock to develop new testing kits, protective equipment, respiratory devices, etc. This approach has helped in providing a common platform for sharing of best practices, collaboration of work, development of need-based innovations, and in avoiding duplication of research work,” the health ministry said in a statement on Thursday.“With the help of institutions under department of science and technology (DST), and sister ministries, DST is taking the lead in coordinating the effort to map and upscale appropriate technologies in India for addressing a plethora of issues related to Covid-19. The department of biotechnology and its PSU, Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council (BIRAC) has announced a Covid-19 research consortium call to support diagnostics, vaccines, novel therapeutics, repurposing of drugs or any other intervention for control of Covid-19.”Preventive steps taken very early in the Covid-19 outbreak have paid off for India and also managed to induce behavioural change, experts said.“The lockdown was supposed to buy us time, which it has managed to do, and to consolidate the gains. People will now need to incorporate the behavioural changes for good such as avoiding mass gatherings, wearing masks, maintaining hygiene, following cough etiquettes, staying at home if feeling sick etc.,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Vardhman Mahavir Medical College and Safdarjung Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/utilised-curbs-to-ramp-up-health-care-infra-centre/story-AWNHpQ2KW7kpUGvehjsWDM.html

22-05-2020||India||India hopes Nepal’s leadership will create ‘positive atmosphere’ for dialogue||India on Thursday called on Nepal’s leadership to create a “positive atmosphere for diplomatic dialogue” to address boundary issues, a day after the two sides sparred on a revised political map that depicted Lipulekh and Kalapani as part of Nepalese territory.The external affairs ministry delivered a sharply worded response on Wednesday after Nepal’s land management minister Padma Kumari Aryal unveiled the new map that showed Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura as part of Byas rural municipality in Sudurpaschim province.Asked about the matter during an online news briefing on Thursday, external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said: “All matters related to outstanding boundary issues will be dealt with between India and Nepal, and we hope the Nepalese leadership will create a positive atmosphere for diplomatic dialogue to resolve the outstanding boundary issues.”India’s position on Nepal’s revised map is consistent, he said. He reiterated India’s contention that the revision of the map was “a unilateral act and not based on historical facts and evidences”. He also reiterated that “such artificial enlargement of territorial claims will not be accepted by us”.Kathmandu’s move came little more than six months after New Delhi published new maps of the union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh that showed Kalapani as part of Uttarakhand state.Nepal’s council of ministers had approved the new map during a meeting chaired by Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli on Monday.The diplomatic row began on May 8 after defence minister Rajnath Singh opened an 80-km road that ends at Lipulekh Pass on the border with China. The road was built so that pilgrims going to Kailash-Mansarovar in the Tibet Autonomous Region can avoid dangerous high-altitude routes through Sikkim and Nepal.Nepal’s foreign ministry summoned the Indian envoy last week to protest against the construction of the road. New Delhi had rejected Kathmandu’s protest, saying Lipulekh is “completely within the territory of India”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-hopes-nepal-s-leadership-will-create-positive-atmosphere-for-dialogue-on-border-issues/story-y3H0ygrBWfvfYZLfrtiCgM.html
22-05-2020||India||Congress in limelight with Uttar Pradesh bus initiative||The Congress seems to have stolen a march on the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) on the migrant crisis in Uttar Pradesh with its aggressive posturing against the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).It is for the first time in the 16 months since she formally joined politics and took up the task of reviving the grand old party’s fortunes in Uttar Pradesh that Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has made some impact in India’s most politically important state with the polite but firm stand she took on the issue.Gandhi insisted that the Yogi Adityanath government allow her party to ferry 1,000 buses with migrant workers from Uttar Pradesh’s borders back to their homes across the state. In a deft move, she told the chief minister that her party would not mind if the BJP wanted to use its flags on the buses, arguing that it was not a political but humanitarian issue.The state government denied permission to the buses to transport the migrants on technical grounds, arming the Congress with ammunition to attack the BJP on grounds that it was anti-poor.The Congress claimed that the BJP had been rattled by Priyanka Gandhi’s stand and hence obstructed the attempt to help migrant workers.“The long march home for our migrant labourers has come at huge human costs...The BJP has shown its real anti-poor face. The BJP government’s continued apathy towards the migrant workers was visible in their initial rejection and then petty games to delay the buses provided by Priyanka ji,” said UP Congress leader Gaurav Kapoor.The BJP said the Congress was trying to mask its own failures in party-ruled states by taking an aggressive stance on it in UP.“These workers are not outsiders for us. They are our own people and our resource. Congress governments in Rajasthan, Punjab or Maharashtra have failed to convince them to stay back while no workers are leaving UP. What the Congress is doing now is just hiding its own failings,” UP BJP spokesperson Chandra Mohan said.While the BJP and the Congress slugged it out in the open, the two regional parties – SP and BSP – surprisingly watched the developments from a distance.The Congress has clearly overshadowed both the parties at least on this issue though there have been “for the record” statements by BSP chief Mayawati and SP president Akhilesh Yadav.Political observers argue that both the SP and BSP are trapped in conventional politics and not able to understand a new shift that been sharpened by the coronavirus pandemic.“Both these parties understand the language of caste but now a new language has reappeared in the political scene due to this pandemic, and that is the language of poor, labourers and migrant workers though it is an old one. For BSP and SP, it is dalits and other backward classes (OBCs),” political analyst Professor Badri Narayan said.“There is a clear shift in identity. While Congress has grabbed it as an opportunity, Mayawati appears nervous and Akhilesh is not able to negotiate this issue and appears clueless,” he added.Congress leader Kapoor said while the BSP was completely missing in action during the pandemic, the SP’s work was limited to a few social media messages. “Migrant workers can clearly see that only Congress is coming to their help in these trying times,” he added.But the BSP said it was working silently for the deprived people, including the migrant workers. “We do it quietly and silently and don’t make propaganda of it. Covid-19 is a big humanitarian crisis and we should have some conscience to help the poor without politicising it,” said BSP leader Antu Mishra.Mayawati did comment on the issue on Wednesday when she accused both the Congress and the BJP of politicising the issue and insisted that the BSP does not engage in any “disgusting” politics.“The disgusting politics being done in the past several days, specially by the BJP and Congress in the name of sending migrant labourers home is most unfortunate. Are these parties accusing each other in connivance to divert attention from the tragedy?” she tweeted.“If it is not so then the BSP has to say that instead of insisting on sending migrants by buses, Congress should help them go home by trains by arranging their tickets,” the BSP chief said in another tweet.The SP too took the same line of argument. “Our approach is more practical and pragmatic and our workers available on the ground to provide help to the migrant workers. But we are not in the game of offering buses. We can create an event out of it but we agree that a sustained process can only be done by the government,” SP spokesperson Abhishek Mishra said.“There should be serious political consequences for this huge migrant crisis triggered by the policy failures on part of the government but ultimately it depends on the people to judge that. This kind of mass migration is unprecedented in the history of India,” he added.For his part, the SP chief was more critical of the BJP than the Congress. “The tales of migrant labourers struggling to reach home are saddening. They are getting killed in accidents daily. But an unconcerned BJP has no care for human values. It is exploiting their eagerness to reach home for its political self-interest,” Yadav said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-in-limelight-with-up-bus-initiative/story-osgCglhzH1Aph51uxx5CbI.html
22-05-2020||India||City records over 500 virus cases for third day, toll goes up to 194||Delhi added 18 deaths from the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on Thursday, taking the city-state’s toll to 194. Of the total deaths, 121 were reported over the last 10 days, when the three-member death audit committee started reporting the backlog of deaths.Delhi also recorded 571 new cases of Covid-19 on Thursday, taking the total number of cases to 11,659, according to the daily health bulletin released by the Delhi government. With over 500 new cases each day, Delhi has been recording the highest single-day spike for the last three days, the data shows.Until May 11, Delhi had reported 73 Covid-19 deaths, according to the daily health bulletin. The higher number of deaths since still puts the mortality rate of the infection in the national capital at 1.6%, which is much lower than the national average of 3.03%.Two days ago, the Delhi government reiterated the need for timely reporting of Covid-19 deaths by designated hospitals. “It has come to notice that both public and private hospitals are not reporting the deaths of positive cases of Covid-19 occurring in their hospitals in a timely and regular manner,” it said in an order.The first order to this effect was issued by the city’s chief secretary Vijay Dev on May 10, asking all hospitals treating Covid-19 patients to send in reports of deaths by 5pm each day. The standard operating procedures were put in place after a discrepancy was noticed in the cumulative number of deaths reported by the health bulletin and by individual hospitals.The addition of over 500 cases daily is the second of three scenarios for which a five-member expert committee had advised the Delhi chief minister to prepare. The first scenario was Delhi reporting 100 cases a day and the third was 1,000 cases a day.“Delhi is already reached the second scenario that the committee had advised about. And Delhi is prepared for the third scenario of 1,000 cases being reported in a day as well,” said Dr SK Sarin, chair of the five-member committee and director of Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences.The Delhi government is in the process of procuring 2,000 oxygen concentrators, devices that selectively remove nitrogen from the ambient air to make it about 93% concentrated oxygen. This can be used for providing oxygen therapy to critical Covid-19 patients.A small percentage of those with the infection – only 0.4% of the patients – need ventilator support. In the country, too, 0.45% of the active cases, or those still with the infection, are on ventilators. Some 2.94% of the people are on oxygen support, according to data from the union health ministry.There are 306 ventilators in the government sector and 800 ventilators in the private sector in Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/city-records-500-virus-cases-for-third-day-toll-goes-up-to-194/story-nsbSCckwlyUWG2TZHaGRhM.html
22-05-2020||India||Pandemic has hit defence production: Rajnath Singh||Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Thursday said the lockdown imposed to check the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in late March has hit defence manufacturing harder than other sectors. He added it is because the government is the only buyer of the defence products.Singh spoke about the hardships faced by the defence industry at an e-conclave. He said the lockdown has hit the manufacturing sector, disrupted supply chains while the defence industry has also been affected due to the strict confinement measures. The Society of Indian Defence Manufacturers (SIDM), Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) and the department of defence production jointly organised SIDM MSME Conclave 2020.Singh said the economic package and the reforms the Centre has announced to tide over the Covid-19 crisis and to give a push to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan (Self-Reliant India Movement)’ would strengthen the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) sector and generate employment.He called MSMEs Indian economy’s backbone as they have accelerated gross domestic product growth, brought in valuable foreign exchange through exports and provided employment opportunities.Singh said over 8,000 MSMEs were an integral part of the production process of the ordnance factories, defence public sector undertakings, dockyards and base repair depots, and their share equalled nearly 20% of the overall the production of these organisations. He said the government was committed to keeping MSMEs strong.Singh praised the contribution of MSMEs in India’s fight against the pandemic. “I am very happy to know that SIDM has accelerated the manufacturing of DRDO [Defence Research and Development Organisation] designed personal protective equipment kits, masks, ventilator parts…In less than two months, we have not only met our domestic demand, but we can also think of helping neighbouring countries...,” a defence ministry statement quoted Singh as saying.He said the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan would provide a raft of opportunities to industry and help create millions of jobs. Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman last week announced a series of measures to boost self-reliance in the defence sector. They include an increase in foreign direct investment (FDI) in defence manufacturing, a separate budget for buying locally-made military hardware and a list of weapons/equipment that cannot be imported. The other measures included corporatisation of the Ordnance Factory Board, indigenisation of imported spares and setting of realistic qualitative requirements for weapons to support the local industry. The FDI limit in the defence manufacturing sector under the automatic route has been increased from 49% to 74%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pandemic-has-hit-defence-production-rajnath/story-UcFeKYfudmbQfynURdGY4M.html
22-05-2020||India||Pandemic affected as many as 93 million urban workers: GoM report||As many as 93 million urban informal workers, across five sectors -- manufacturing, construction, trade, tourism and hospitality -- have been affected by the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdown imposed to slow its spread, according to an informal Group of Ministers headed by social justice minister Thawarchand Gehlot.Among the suggestions, which were submitted in a report to the Prime Minister’s Office last week are: a database of the workers; a job card for every migrant worker returning to their village and a complete tweaking of the rural employment guarantee scheme that allows work in a private factory or construction site, with the employer paying wages above the MNREGA wage component which will continue to be paid by the government; and an app named Kaushal (literally, skill) that allows workers to register for skill development courses and also reach out to potential employers. Hindustan Times has reviewed the contents of the report. Gehlot declined comment on the report and said its “contents are not public yet.’’The group also emphasised that there need to be confidence building measures to bring back migrant workers to the cities. These could be in the form of scholarships for their children, access to anganwadis and training and upskilling. All migrant workers should be automatically enrolled in the Ayushman Bharat or national health insurance scheme, the ministerial group said.``We tried to touch upon every aspect in our report,’’ said one of the ministers part of the GoM, ``But let us see which ones are approved by the Prime Minister before we comment on it.’’The group also pointed out that even workers in the organised sector faced the risk of losing their jobs. The Centre for Monitoring of Indian Economy (CMIE) announced last week that 114 million jobs have been lost in April and unemployment is at a record high of 27.1%. The report , while acknowledging that the lockdown saved lives, says that the country now faces an economic crisis whose elements include the loss of jobs and livelihood. Its very first recommendation is to restart economic activities at the earliest. To be sure, the government has allowed for the restart of more economic activities in a phased manner -- from May 3, and subsequently, from May 18.This week, it announced the restarting of limited flights and some regular train services. Biswajit Dhar who teaches economics at Jawahar Lal Nehru University isn’t convinced an app will help. ``The migrants need immediate help and so the government should see this as an opportunity to boost the rural economy and help them find jobs locally. How will apps help when most of them won’t be online?’’||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/93mn-urban-workers-affected-gom-report/story-mJX2aiWbpk5lJC7KNG4Y8K.html
22-05-2020||India||Entrepreneurship to be the focus of new HRD channel||The Union Human Resource Development (HRD) ministry and All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) plan to launch a niche direct to home (DTH), or digital TV channel, focussed on honing entrepreneurial skills of younger people and to keep them abreast with the latest innovations, officials aware of the matter said. The move comes as the Centre is increasingly looking towards the DTH and radio modes to meet educational requirements for students and to overcome the digital divide as the Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdown imposed to check its spread in late March have disrupted the academic year. HT on May 8 reported HRD ministry is planning to start 12 DTH television channels each catering to students from Classes 1 to 12. The channels will serve as virtual classrooms when schools are shut due to the Covid-19 outbreak and amid concerns that online learning might leave behind those with slow or limited internet connectivity.According to details accessed by HT, AICTE, the technical education regulator, has formed a nine-member advisory panel of journalists, entrepreneurs, and educationists to develop the concept for its channel. A Surya Prakash, the former head of public broadcasting agency Prasar Bharati, will head the panel. The panel will also include AICTE chief Anil Sahasrabuddhe as co-chairman, Prasar Bharati CEO Shashi Shekhar Vempati, education portal upGrad chairman Ronnie Screwvala, Times Now editor-in-chief Rahul Shivshankar, Rakesh Khar, (Network18 Group) and Alok Agarwal, managing partner, The Growth Labs, Alok Nath Jha (DD Kisan), and Abhay Jere (HRD ministry).Prakash said innovation is critical for the advancement of any nation and all nations are driven by innovation. “I congratulate HRD [ministry] and AICTE for thinking of a niche channel devoted to innovation. Our society is brimming with ideas and this endeavour will give a fillip to entrepreneurship, ideas, and innovation in the country,” he said.An AICTE official said the panel is expected to begin its work from the next week. “HRD [ministry]’s Innovation Cell and AICTE have come together for the purpose of creating the platform. The idea is to bring a channel that can serve as a platform for the entire country’s young population. It will highlight the latest innovations and research happening in the country and globally and also showcase the work done by young entrepreneurs,” said the official on condition of anonymity.INDEPENDENT COMMENT||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/entrepreneurship-to-be-the-focus-of-new-hrd-channel/story-a1MjOs3I3c3ziRREnvvpGK.html
22-05-2020||India||President Ram Nath Kovind accepts credentials of seven envoys in e-ceremony||President Ram Nath Kovind became India’s first head of state to receive and accept diplomatic credentials of seven foreign envoys in an e-ceremony, heralding “digital diplomacy” because of the restrictions imposed by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.Elaborate physical ceremonies for the presentation of credentials have been put on hold during the national lockdown with Covid-19 protocols firmly in place at Rashtrapati Bhavan and President Kovind minimising his engagements. “But it was felt necessary to conduct the credential presentation online, as it is a vital part of diplomatic culture which shouldn’t be overlooked,” said a senior Rashtrapati Bhavan official who asked not to be named.The ambassadors of DPR Korea, Senegal, Côte d’Ivoire, and the high commissioners of Trinidad & Tobago, Mauritius, Australia and Rwanda came to South Block on Thursday morning and stood one by one in front of a large screen, through which President Kovind welcomed them. The distance between South Block and Rashtrapati Bhavan is less than 200 metres.These were the first batch of envoys who presented their credentials after the Covid pandemic swept India leading to a federal lockdown since March 25. Secretary (west) of the ministry of external affairs, Vikas Swaroop, was present with the envoys during the ceremony, the official cited above said.“The envoys read out their letters credence and the President accepted them on the TV screen. They also nodded at the President as per the protocol, and some envoys even extended an invitation to the President on behalf of their head of state to visit their countries. The President accepted them and, at the end, he delivered a short speech welcoming them in India and also mentioned how our country is fighting against Covid,” said a second official aware of the matter.As per protocol, envoys do not begin their formal duties until their credentials are accepted, and their precedence within the diplomatic corps is determined by the date on which the credentials are presentedUsually, the presentation of credentials is an elaborate ceremony with strict rules and rituals. The envoys come to Rashtrapati Bhavan accompanied by a foreign ministry official; they have to sit in a specific seat in the car with the protocol officer next to them; the diplomat is received at the forecourt of the presidential palace by the commander of the Presidential Guard; there is a guard of honour in the middle arc of the main entrance, and the police band plays the national anthem of the diplomat’s country. Once inside the ceremonial hall, the diplomat sits two metres away from the President; does not shake hands or exchange any words, but gives a gentle bow.While these arrangements could not be done due to Covid restrictions, a new beginning was made.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/prez-accepts-credentials-of-seven-envoys-in-e-ceremony/story-40EuDeemwsfCeGDffMBtfN.html
22-05-2020||India||Culture ministry plans norms for public spaces||The Union culture ministry is drafting guidelines for people to enter public spaces governed by institutes that come under its regulation -- including national monuments such as the Taj Mahal, galleries such as the National Gallery of Modern Art, and other museums and libraries -- once the national lockdown imposed to contain the spread of Covid-19 is lifted.According to a senior ministry official aware of the drafting process, the protocols include wearing face masks, thermal screening, social distancing, online purchase of tickets, separate entry and exit points to stop crowding, and access in small batches.“Once the protocols are in place, there will be no entry without masks, and visitors will be allowed entry in batches. Social distancing norms of a distance of at least two metres will have to be followed; there will be thermal screening at entry points, and fumigation at regular intervals,” said the official cited above. The detailed guidelines are being drafted following a meeting early this week of senior officials and culture minister Prahlad Singh Patel, the official said, adding that they will be sent to the health ministry for approval.A second official, however, clarified that these cultural spaces will not be open to the public immediately. “We are waiting for the pandemic to subside, and if there needs to be more wait time, we will have to divert resources on digitising,” said the official. He added that ministry was also considering creating a way to visit monuments such as the Taj Mahal virtually. “Since the monument attracts hundreds of people daily, so opening it up completely will be a challenge,” the second official said. Some institutes under the ministry have been facilitating digital experiences since public visits were suspended because if the national lockdown.

22-05-2020||India||Govt tells states to follow night curfew, flags norms’ violation||The ministry of home affairs (MHA) on Thursday again nudged the states to strictly follow lockdown guidelines, particularly the night curfew, to make sure people observe social distancing norms and contain the risk of infection spreading.In a letter to the states, Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla said the night curfew, which means all non-essential activity and movement is prohibited between 7 pm and 7 am across the country, was an “important element” of MHA guidelines. The guidelines were issued on Sunday for the fourth phase of the lockdown, extended till May 31.Bhalla wrote: “it has been brought to the notice of MHA, through media reports and other sources that there are violations, at various places, in the implementation of guidelines”. He asked local authorities to issue orders in their jurisdictions on the imposition of night curfew.Bhalla’s letter, a copy of which has been seen by Hindustan Times, doesn’t name any particular state but West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banreeje had on Monday, while issuing its own guidelines, ruled out the enforcement of night curfew.“We won’t officially declare night curfew because people are already under a lot of stress. We do not want to increase their suffering. But we will request people not to venture out of their homes between 7 pm and 7 am or else police will take action,” Banerjee said on Monday. She had said the word curfew has negative connotations.An MHA official, who didn’t want to be named, said lockdown guidelines had been issued after consulting all the states. “If they don’t follow these, then it is a clear violation and the states doing so are putting their people at risk,” the official said.On Monday, the ministry had even reminded all states that they cannot dilute the lockdown guidelines issued under the Disaster Management Act.Bhalla, on Thursday, also asked the states to properly delineate the containment zones and take action if the violations are reported in any of the zones – red, orange or green.The national directives, issued along with the guidelines, should also be followed throughout the country, Bhalla added. These include wearing of masks, social distancing at work, transport and public places and maintaining hygiene and sanitation to contain the spread of Covid-19 and protecting individuals and the community, the letter said“I would request all chief secretaries and administrators of union territories to remain vigilant in the fight against Covid-19 and ensure all measures that have either been mandated by MHA or laid down by the states are scrupulously adhered to at all levels,” Bhalla added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-tells-states-to-follow-night-curfew-flags-norms-violation/story-ebuIY2OGy4Cf9qJgJP1eVK.html
22-05-2020||India||Private airlines likely to be part of third phase of Vande Bharat Mission||The third phase of the Vande Bharat Mission, India’s massive programme to repatriate nationals stranded across the globe because of the Covid-19 crisis, is expected to involve private airlines to increase the number of flights.The third phase is set to begin after June 13, when the second phase will end. India is bringing back about 32,000 citizens on more than 160 flights from 47 countries during the second phase, which began on May 16.“There will be a third phase of repatriation. The second phase will last till June 13,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava told an online news briefing.“We are very receptive to the idea [of involving private airlines] and the ministry of civil aviation is already in discussions with private airlines to see how they can be included under the Vande Bharat Mission so that we can increase the number of flights,” he said.All flights in the first two phases were being operated by state-run Air India and its subsidiary Air India Express. The government has also used air force transport aircraft and naval warships to repatriate nationals from some countries.As of Thursday, a total of 23,475 Indians have been repatriated under the Vande Bharat Mission. They include 4,883 workers, 4,196 students and 3,087 professionals.The second phase has included destinations such as Istanbul, Ho Chi Minh City and Lagos, and increased flights to the US and Europe. “We are also looking at developing Frankfurt as a hub [for Europe],” Srivastava said.Several flights from other countries, coming in to evacuate citizens of those countries, have ferried stranded Indians. A flight from Buenos Aires that arrived on Thursday morning carried 62 Indians, while a flight operated by Iran’s Mahaan Air on May 17 carried about 300 Indian pilgrims from Ladakh.Other flights have brought back Indians from Argentina, Djibouti, Hong Kong, Mongolia, Peru and South Africa. A special Tunisian military evacuation flight took off from Tunis on Thursday with 25 Indian nationals and it is expected to arrive in New Delhi on Friday morning.A total of 259,001 Indian nationals in 98 countries around the world have registered to return under Vande Bharat Mission. Most of them are workers (28%), students (25%), professionals (14.5%), and short-term visa holders such as tourists (7.6%). Fishermen, deportees and Indian nationals who benefited from visa amnesties have also registered.The government has already said priority will be given to those with compelling reasons for returning, such as loss of jobs, medical emergencies and senior citizens. Among those with compelling reasons who registered to return are 16,991 facing medical emergencies and 8,746 pregnant women and senior citizens. Following a spat between the Central and West Bengal governments over the lack of flights to the state, 169 Indian nationals were repatriated from Dhaka to Kolkata on May 18. Two more Dhaka-Kolkata flights are scheduled for May 27 and June 1, and further flights to West Bengal are planned from Europe, the UK and other destinations.Srivastava said India is also facilitating the travel of foreign nationals on outbound flights under the Vande Bharat Mission. Three flights were operated to the UK on May 16, 18 and 20 and two flights to the US on May 18 and 20. Four more flights are scheduled to the US and two to Frankfurt.Wherever possible, passengers have to undergo testing before boarding flights and in a few instances, those who tested positive for Covid-19 weren’t allowed to board. “There is full medical screening and only asymptomatic passengers are allowed on board,” Srivastava said....||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/private-airlines-likely-to-be-part-of-third-phase-of-vande-bharat-mission/story-o8MOLGQoUTD0FaYsV2ae9O.html
22-05-2020||India||Industry supports Army’s 3-year ‘tour of duty’ proposal||After industrialist Anand Mahindra backed the army’s proposed “tour of duty” (ToD) model last week, industry body Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (Assocham) on Thursday supported the proposal that seeks to allow the country’s youth to serve the military for three years, an army officer familiar with the move said.The scheme has also elicited a positive response from some other industrialists. The industry body, in an e-mail to the army on Thursday, described the ToD initiative of the government as a “game changer”, said the official cited above, requesting anonymity. He said Assocham has communicated to the army that it will work with the government to promote the ToD scheme not just as an “employment opportunity” but as a “nation building” initiative “where the industry will send existing employees for a three-year tour of duty with job security when they return.”Bharat Forge chairman Baba Kalyani said his company would even consider hiring candidates first and then let them do the military internship “as it will help us groom our work force in ethos of the army.” The ToD model is similar to the short-service commission that allows officers to serve the armed forces for 10 to 14 years.If the proposal is accepted, the army could implement the ToD model - essentially a voluntary internship after military training - on a trial basis for both officers and other ranks in a limited number of vacancies,Last week, Mahindra said the ToD exposure would give young people an “added advantage” in their next workplace. In an e-mail to the army, Mahindra said his group would be happy to consider the candidature of ToD optees for corporate jobs.“I definitely think military training will be an added advantage for Tour of Duty Graduates as they enter the workplace. In fact, considering the rigid standards of selection and training in the Indian Army, the Mahindra Group will be happy to consider their candidature,” Mahindra wrote.The ToD proposal, reviewed by Hindustan Times, stressed that the internship model would result in savings for the organisation. It said it will also brighten the prospects of the ToD optees in the corporate world.“The cumulative cost of pre-commission training, pay/allowances, proposed severance packages, leave encashment and other costs is nearly Rs 5.12 crore and Rs 6.83 crore for short-service commissioned (SSC) officers released after 10 and 14 years of service. However, similar costs for those released after three years will be just Rs 80 to Rs 85 lakh,” the proposal stated. It said the ToD model would eventually result in significant reduction in salary and pension budgets, too. The proposal cites a survey that has indicated that corporate houses would prefer employing individuals who have been trained by the military and join them at the age of 26-27 after a three-year ToD rather than college graduates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/industry-supports-army-s-3-yr-tour-of-duty-proposal/story-SXDQF9IBywBjabIpkzg38J.html
22-05-2020||India||India on alert as locusts from Pak threaten farms||India is on the alert for crop-munching desert locusts, which according to a UN warning, pose a “severe” risk to the country’s agriculture this year, as a top pest-monitoring agency flagged signs of an early-than-usual summer invasion of the species of grasshoppers from across Pakistan. This has prompted the Union agriculture ministry to consider importing equipment from the UK, apart from deploying drones, satellite-derived tools, special fire-tenders and sprayers at pre-identified border locations. Protocols are in place for India to hold videoconferencing meetings with authorities in Pakistan for joint strategies, an agriculture ministry official said requesting anonymity because he is not authorised to speak to the media. Locusts can fly up to 150 km daily and a one square km swarm can eat as much food as 35,000 people in terms of weight in a single day, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)’s Desert Locust Information Service bulletin.A surge in locust attacks since last year is being attributed to favourable breeding weather caused by a large number of cyclones in East Africa. India, China and Pakistan face the most risk in Asia, according to the UN. Pakistan has already declared an agricultural emergency, according to the official cited above.Locust attacks are known to cause a considerable drop in agricultural output. A moderate infestation chomped through winter crops in an estimated 300,000 hectares in Rajasthan and Gujarat in January. The crucial summer sowing season begins next month. The alert on Wednesday came after a month of monitoring by the locust warning office, a wing under the agriculture ministry’s directorate of plant protection. Their field agents spotted clouds of the insects in mid-April in Rajasthan’s Sri Ganganagar and Jaisalmer districts. Agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar consulted representatives of the pesticide industry on May 13, a second plant quarantine department official said. Tomar reviewed broad measures to fight off infestations. The ministry now plans to import some equipment from the UK. In December last year, India held preparatory meetings with Pakistani teams on the India-Pakistan border in Munabao and Khokhapar in Rajasthan’s Barmer district, an official said.India is constantly monitoring the pests and scheduling more talks with Pakistani representatives during the entire June to September kharif (summer-sown) season, said KL Gurjar, deputy director at India’s directorate of plant protection. Gurjar was one of the participants at the border talks in December. A report of a senior locust forecasting officer of FAO to the government noted that “swarms would be present in Haryana and Punjab, moving east towards Bangladesh similar to 1950 when there were devastating plagues that lasted up to 14 consecutive years.”“Despite the Covid-19 lockdown, the locust control offices are working since April 11, 2020, with 50 spray equipment and vehicles, in coordination with officials of district administration and state agriculture department,” a statement from the farm ministry said. Normally, with the arrival of the monsoon, locust swarms enter the Scheduled Desert Areas of India via Pakistan for breeding in June and July, but this year, their presence was first reported on April 11.“The situation remains extremely alarming in the Horn of Africa, specifically Kenya, Ethiopia and Somalia, where widespread breeding is in progress and new swarms are expected to form in the coming weeks,” an FAO alert issued this month said.Heavy cyclones made for favourable breeding conditions also in the southern Arabian Peninsula for at least nine months (June 2018 to March 2019), allowing “three generations of breeding that was undetected and not controlled”, FAO said.Pest specialists are drawing on standard strategies, such as maintaining sufficient reserves of melathion, the principal insecticide. “Overnight, they can devour field after field. One large swarm can cover several districts,” said JN Thakur, a former chief of locust monitoring at the agriculture ministry.According to Thakur, India has an experience of fighting the pest from two previous outbreaks, in 1950 and 1993, but the country lacks large insecticide-spraying aircraft, which are the most effective way of dealing with a large-scale crisis.Until May 11, the pests have been “controlled in an area of ​​14,299 hectares of Jaisalmer, Sri Ganganagar, Jodhpur, Barmer, and Nagaur districts in Rajasthan and Fazilka districts of Punjab”, the official said. Swarms are active in Barmer, Phalodi (Jodhpur), Nagaur, Sriganganagar, and Ajmer districts of Rajasthan. The Union government has decided to conduct awareness campaigns and training for farmers and officials from these states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-on-alert-as-locusts-from-pak-threaten-farms/story-oG5EgeTu1Y6QQq8CHpm7mM.html
22-05-2020||India||Heatwave to affect parts of country over the weekend||Clear skies almost all over the country, a change in wind patterns following cyclone Amphan as well as hot, dry north-westerly winds blowing over Peninsular India have made conditions favourable for heatwaves after an unusually pleasant spell of weather due back-to-back western disturbances, according to India Meteorological Department (IMD) scientists. IMD on Thursday said there will be a 2-4 degrees Celsius rise in maximum temperatures over the country’s northwestern, central and western parts in the next two to three days. It has warned of heatwaves in Rajasthan (May 21-25); western Madhya Pradesh, Vidarbha and Telangana (May 21-24); coastal Andhra Pradesh, Yanam, north interior Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Puducherry and Karaikal (May 21-23); eastern Madhya Pradesh, Rayalseema and Uttar Pradesh (May 22-25).A heatwave is declared when the maximum temperature hits 45 degrees Celsius or is above 40 degrees Celsius in summer with a variation of five degrees or more above the normal temperatures.IMD said a feeble western disturbance on Friday is likely to bring rain and thundershowers to Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand and light thundershowers to Haryana, Punjab and Delhi. It added maximum temperatures, however, are likely to rise in the northern plains. Western disturbances are low-pressure systems that generally originate over the Mediterranean region and are known to bring winter rain in India. Their intensity reduces in summer when they move to upper latitudes. At 44.1 degrees C, Palam recorded the maximum temperature in Delhi on Thursday. It was the highest this season. At Safdurjung, the temperature was recorded at 42.7 degrees C, three degrees above normal.According to private forecaster Skymet Weather Services, heatwave conditions are likely over Delhi and Haryana also after 2 to 3 days.National Weather Forecasting Centre head K Sathi Devi said two important factors are responsible for the rise in temperatures. “...one is there is no clouding. There are clear skies almost all over the country except where the cyclone or depression is. The other reason is there is advection; wind patterns have changed after the cyclone.” Devi said hot, dry north-westerly winds were blowing even over the Peninsular India, which makes conditions favourable for heatwaves. “East MP [Madhya Pradesh], Rajasthan, UP [Uttar Pradesh], parts of Peninsular India are all likely to develop heatwave like conditions now. There is no major weather system that can cause clouding. The impact of western disturbances will also gradually reduce now leading to higher temperatures in northwest India including Delhi.”Barmer (Rajasthan) and Aloka (Maharashtra) recorded the highest temperatures in the country on Wednesday (44.2 degrees C). Sunita Devi, the in-charge of cyclones at IMD, said, “Because of the cyclone, all the moisture is concentrated around it while dry, north-westerly winds are blowing over the rest of the country, which causes temperatures to peak gradually.”Even June is expected to be very hot in parts of the country. “If there is no western disturbance, NW [north western] India will be hot even in June. Hot winds from desert regions will heat up the region as wind patterns have changed after Amphan,” said D S Pai, a senior scientist at IMD, Pune.Amphan led to an early onset of the monsoon over the Andaman and Nicobar Islands on May 17. A low pressure before the formation of Amphan made conditions favourable for the advancement. The onset of the monsoon over Kerala is likely to be delayed by four days and is expected to arrive on June 5, IMD said last week. It marks the beginning of the four-month rainy season when India receives 70% of its annual rainfall. IMD’s south-west monsoon forecasts provide information to at least 700 million people in India, who are dependent on agriculture for livelihood. The delay could have implications for farmers impacted by an economic slowdown associated with the Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdown.The monsoon is crucial for the yield of rice, wheat, sugarcane, and oilseeds in a country where farming accounts for about 15% of the economy but employs over half of its people. M Mohapatra, director-general, IMD, said after a cyclone passes, the atmosphere is disturbed. “It takes time to come back to normal. Monsoon advancement can begin normally only when normal atmospheric and wind conditions are restored. The westerly hot winds also impact most parts of the country.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/heatwave-to-affect-parts-of-country-over-the-weekend/story-uhp0Vrlg53iKOOtGw3q75H.html
22-05-2020||India||Cyclone Amphan wreaks havoc on 4.5 million people across Odisha; 72 dead in West Bengal||Cyclone Amphan, which hit India’s eastern coast with winds gusting up to 185 kph on Wednesday, has affected 4.5 million people across 1,500 villages in Odisha, the state government informed the Centre on Thursday even as it has asked officials to submit reports about the damages caused in two days.Odisha chief secretary Asit Tripathy told Union cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba via video-conferencing that there was no loss of lives in the state even as the cyclone brought a heavy downpour and winds speeding up to 100 kph in some coastal areas. Amphan was the most powerful cyclone to strike eastern India and Bangladesh in over a decade. It tore down power lines, uprooted trees, caused flooding, triggered mass evacuations and left at least 72 people dead in West Bengal, where it made landfall.“Nearly two lakh [200,000] people in Odisha were evacuated from their homes and placed safely in different shelters during the cyclone. A total of 210 medical teams and 75 teams of veterinary doctors have been sent to the affected areas,” Tripathy said. He added that collectors of the affected districts have been asked to submit reports about the damages caused in two days.Tripathy thanked India Meteorological Department (IMD) director-general Mrutyunjay Mohapatra for accurate predictions and added correct forecast of the natural calamity helped contain the damage to life and property. “The IMD is valuable in this area and its forecast is getting better with time. We thank Mohapatra, NDRF [ National Disaster Response Force] DG [director general] S N Pradhan and everyone in this valuable national body,” he said.Additional chief secretary and special relief commissioner P K Jena, too, thanked Mohapatra for re-assuring the state government to have complete faith in IMD’s prediction and forecast on Amphan. IMD had informed the state government that the wind speeds at Paradip and Dhamara coast would be around 135 kph which turned out to be correct. Jena said that Mohapatra had made accurate predictions on ferocious cyclonic storms like Fani (2019) and Phailin (2013).Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik separately conducted an aerial survey of the affected areas of the state’s coastal and adjoining districts that took the brunt of Amphan.Winds gusting up to 100 kph uprooted trees, flattening kutcha houses, disrupted vehicular movement and power supply across Odisha’s Bhadrak, Jagatsinghpur, Kendrapara and Balasore districts. Odisha energy minister Dibya Shankar Mishra said that over 80% of power supply was being restored while Pradhan said all roads in the cyclone-hit districts would be cleared within 24-48 hours.In a tweet, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said authorities were working on the ground to ensure all possible assistance to the cyclone-hit people. “My thoughts are with the people of Odisha as the state bravely battles the effects of Cyclone Amphan. Authorities are working on the ground to ensure all possible assistance to the those affected. I pray that the situation normalises at the earliest,” Modi tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/downpour-storm-wreak-havoc-on-4-5mn-people-across-odisha/story-uXs8bjUFojBmXnlaVsamjO.html
22-05-2020||India||Cyclone Amphan unleashes fury||The trail of destruction Cyclone Amphan left behind as it hit Kolkata with wind speed gusting up to 130 kph on Wednesday amid the Covid-19 pandemic is the worst the city has witnessed for a long time, residents said.The cyclone was the most severe in over a decade and plunged parts of the city into darkness as it felled electricity poles, trees, upturned cars and flooded the Kolkata airport as well as several other neighbourhoods. It was designated a super cyclone even as Amphan weakened after making landfall between and Bangladesh with winds that gusted up to 185 kph.“After every calamity, we tend to compare it with something in the past. We have seen Cyclone Aila in 2009 and Cyclone Bulbul in 2019. But Amphan was like hell. I have not seen anything of this sort in my life. It was as if the storm was whistling and bulldozing its way through,” said Bibhutibhusan Dey, a 70-year-old Kolkata resident.Cyclone Aila and Bulbul left 339 and 41 people dead. West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee said at least 72 people were killed in her state alone after Amphan tore into it.Many said they felt as if an earthquake has struck the city when the cyclone battered it with their buildings swaying. Residents of highrises felt the cyclone impact more intensely in eastern Kolkata. A part of Kolkata still has large open areas but Amphan passed closer through its eastern parts. “We felt as if the entire building was swaying. Initially we thought it was an earthquake as the cyclone was raging outside... It was really scary,” said Arpita Pal, who lives on the 10th floor of a highrise.Bengali film actor Ankush Hazra echoed the feeling on social media and shared visuals of his damaged apartment. “Earthquake or Cyclone?” he wrote on Instagram.Kolkata’s streets and lanes were littered with broken glasses of shattered window panes, damaged vehicles trapped under unrooted trees, lamp posts, and traffic signals on Thursday morning. Several houses were also damaged when uprooted trees fell on them. A Kolkata Municipal Corporation official said they were getting dozens of calls every second at their control room. “Hundreds of trees, lamp posts, and traffic signals have been uprooted. Several roads have been blocked. Power lines, cable wires, and telephone wires have snapped. The city is in a mess.”Netizens uploaded pictures and videos of exploding transformers, falling trees, tin roofs, and street-hoardings amid the raging storm on social networking sites. “I saw at least two transformers exploding. It was like fireworks on Diwali night. The entire area has been plunged into the darkness since. No electronic gadgets are working. I could only charge one mobile with a power bank,” said Arindam Biswas, a resident of Kolkata’s Baghajatin. The city had virtually come to standstill as many roads remained blocked while there was hardly any mobile connectivity amid the closure of shops and markets. “It was a real lockdown and everyone maintained social distancing. No going out. No mobile phones either,” said Arindam Sen, a resident of the Madurdaha area.The situation in the slums was even worse as thousands of shanties were badly damaged. Their roofs and walls gave way in the face of the storm and intense rain and forced slum dwellers to either take shelter in nearby schools or in some concrete houses.“We never thought the storm would be so intense. The civic officials told us to move to the nearby school building. But as we had seen Aila and Bulbul, we thought Amphan would be the same or a little more intensity. But when it hit, we had nowhere to go. The school was too far. We decided to take shelter in a nearby two-storeyed house,” said Sheetal, who works as a maid and lives in a shanty near Anandapur in east Kolkata.Municipal authorities said they were yet to assess the damage. “The entire Nabanna building (state secretariat building) was swaying it seemed. Once I tried to enter my office on the 14th floor. I couldn’t. The window panes were shaking and vibrating as if they would freak anytime. I have never witnessed such a calamity,” said chief minister Mamata Banerjee. “It was a virus in the sky. Meteorologists had said it would hit a certain point and that it would take around 4 hours to pass. But it was nearly 400 km wide and carried on its devastation for several hours. It could be a subject of research. I have never seen such a calamity,” said Banerjee||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amphan-unleashes-fury/story-gYizm13oDhixnPDMUUXz5I.html
22-05-2020||India||84% women say lockdown restricted their access to menstrual products: Survey||Access to menstrual hygiene products has been affected by the lockdown for young girls and women who depend on schools and community places, a survey has found. The survey, conducted by the Menstrual Health Alliance India (MHAI), has also found that 84% women who responded said that there is either no or severely restricted access to menstrual products in communities that they work in, especially for sanitary pads. As per the survey, whose findings were released by Dasra and Change.org, consumers of 62% of the organisations manufacturing menstrual hygiene products that took part in the survey faced problems in accessing products from their regular channels, while 22% reported no access to menstrual products at all.In the rapid survey, 67 organisations participated, and 45 were from India, 16 from the African region and six from other countries. Fifty four of the organisations were rural and 49 were urban. The survey was conducted in April and 94% respondents were either in lockdown or state mandated social distancing at the time of the survey. Disposable pads were manufactured or distributed by 23 organisations, 28 made reusable pads, while 13 made menstrual cups. Sixty five percent of their clientele or beneficiaries were adolescent girls, 59% were women, 27% were post-partum women, while 34% had disabilities. This meant that more women were forced to use clothes, and the lack of knowledge of hygiene norms was a risk. “Most adolescent girls from low-income households depended on school-based supply in Government schools. Given that schools have been closed since the lockdown, they have started using cloth pads. We need to look at how reusable product choices like cloth pads and menstrual cups can be promoted with information on maintenance of hygiene in order to build resilient MHM practices,” Tanya Mahajan of the MHAI said. The survey found that only 25% were fully operational, and 50% partially. “Very few units had raw material availability for the next 3 months – only 25% had availability and 40% had partial availability,” the report said. Of these, only 24% were in a position to service demand from their community while 46% were able to do so partially. Road transport restrictions were the main roadblock, and with new production norms expecting a focus on a limited capacity, production was affected in many places. In addition to that, the limited availability of migrant labours was a factor. Import restrictions, especially for menstrual cups imported from facilities in Europe to ensure quality benchmarks, was challenging. “Raw materials for disposable sanitary pads, particularly wood pulp, have become challenging,” the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/84-women-say-lockdown-restricted-their-access-to-menstrual-products-survey/story-tdwlmvGPyfy2HVBE6UHRgM.html
22-05-2020||India||PM Modi in Bengal, Odisha today in wake of cyclone Amphan; to hold review meetings||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will travel to West Bengal and Odisha on Friday to conduct an aerial survey of the damage caused by Cyclone Amphan, a government spokesperson said. “Tomorrow, PM @narendramodi will travel to West Bengal and Odisha to take stock of the situation in the wake of Cyclone Amphan. He will conduct aerial surveys and take part in review meetings, where aspects of relief and rehabilitation will be discussed,” tweeted the Prime MInister’s office.This will be PM Modi’s first visit anywhere since the first lockdown to halt the spread of coronavirus was put in place on March 25.Cyclone Amphan has left 72 people dead and thousands homeless in West Bengal, battering several parts of the state and washing away bridges and swamping low-lying areas. It also wreaked havoc in Odisha damaging power and telecom infrastructure in several coastal districts.The extremely severe cyclonic storm has weakened and moved to Bangladesh, the IMD said.National Disaster Response Force chief SD Pradhan told reporters that Odisha, which had also evacuated over 1.5 lakh people, wasn’t hit as badly as Bengal and would be back to normal in another two days or so.News of PM Modi’s decision came hours after Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee pitched for central assistance and appealed to PM Modi to visit the cyclone-hit areas. Bengal, which had moved out five lakh people to shield them from the cyclone that roared into the state on Wednesday, packing winds gusting to a top speed of 185 kmph.Earlier in the day, PM Modi assured West Bengal that the country stands in solidarity with it as the state counts its losses in the wake of cyclone Amphan.“Have been seeing visuals from West Bengal on the devastation caused by Cyclone Amphan. In this challenging hour, the entire nation stands in solidarity with West Bengal. Praying for the well-being of the people of the state. Efforts are on to ensure normalcy, Prime Minister Modi said in a tweet.The PM would first reach West Bengal in the morning and then go to Odisha in the afternoon, reported the Press Trust of India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-visit-bengal-in-the-aftermath-of-cyclone-amphan-accepts-cm-mamata-s-request/story-p7YjD7Z704ZL7PT8NqguCM.html
22-05-2020||Editorials||Managing the border with China| HT Editorial||Soldiers engaged in hostilities on three border points would be ominous in almost any context except where India and China are concerned. Along the Line of Actual Control, it could mean an escalating confrontation that could spread into diplomatic and economic spheres. Or it could mean that another border incident has got a bit out of control. The reasons for escalation could be the ever-changing border infrastructure or a rush of blood by an individual soldier. If the latter, one can expect the status quo to be restored, but after much muscle-flexing.The problem in Sino-Indian relations is that whether such incidents are motivated by the geological or the geopolitical is often unclear to either side. Much of the discussion at officer-level flag meetings or between diplomats in the twin capitals is about trying to determine at which level the wheels are turning. That, in turn, goes to a much deeper issue of distrust between India and China and opacity on the part of both governments, but with Beijing being the blacker box. The two countries now have four border management agreements, with a fifth in the works. But with new roads being built, better vehicles being deployed, and the strategic landscape forever changing along the border, each agreement starts becoming outdated as soon as the ink dries. India and Chinese troops are face-to-face in Galwan Valley, Finger 4 and Naku La. China’s “all weather friend”, Pakistan, has turned up the temperature along the Kashmir border. But, at the same time, the People’s Bank of China’s licence to invest in India has just been renewed. Beijing has ensured emergency medical supplies are being sent, albeit with some quality control issues. In contrast to the rhetorical aggression that Beijing has shown to the West or Southeast Asia, the noises from China regarding India have been benign. This is all part of a long-standing dichotomy in the Sino-Indian relations, much competitiveness with many elements of cooperation. However, with the international strategic environment changing, this rough-and-ready way of handling bilateral relations needs to be replaced. The goal should be a framework where lines of communication, strategic red lines and dotted lines along maps are all better delineated. This is a task of a generation, but one that is essential if India and China are to ensure border flare-ups do not become something much larger and more dangerous.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/managing-the-border-with-china/story-X07wtbRjRyatiEAmQ9IQqO.html
22-05-2020||Editorials||Amphan brings a message||Cyclone Amphan, the most severe storm in the Bay of Bengal since 1999, battered India (Odisha and West Bengal), and Bangladesh, on Wednesday. Between the two Indian states, West Bengal was hit the hardest as the cyclone made landfall in the Sundarbans at a top speed of 185 kmph, but went parallel to the Odisha coast. Winds decreased as the cyclone moved north-northeast, but it was powerful enough to destroy uncemented houses, uproot trees and crops and electric pylons, and caused rivers to breach their embankments. “If Aila [2009] was 10, this is 110,” said West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee. At the time of writing, the death toll in Bengal has touched 72. It may have been higher in the state (and in Odisha) but for the timely prediction by the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD); massive evacuation by both states (6,58,000 people); the presence of cyclone shelters; and regular cyclone updates by the state authorities to the people. WATCH | Cyclone Amphan leaves trail of destruction in Odisha & West BengalThe next phase of work starts now: Rebuilding infrastructure and reaching out to people with food, clean water and medical help. Many of those who have moved to temporary shelters have no homes now. Agriculturists have not just lost crops, but livestock. The storm surge may have also lead to the ingress of saline water into the fields and homes in the Sundarbans. This will hit soil quality and impact productivity, and force people to migrate in search of livelihood. The states now need to carry out a detailed assessment of what Amphan has done. Reconstruction efforts are never easy; it will be much more difficult now with the states battling another challenge that has taken a toll on their finances and human resources — the coronavirus pandemic. Cyclone Amphan is also a reminder that oceans are warming due to rising emissions, and warm ocean water is a key ingredient for the formation of tropical cyclones. The number of cyclones in the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal has increased by 32% in the last five years, says IMD data. However, the solutions — tackling the sources of global warming, and investing in and upgrading climate resilience and adaptation techniques — are complex processes and expensive. It also needs tremendous political will and people’s support and participation to ensure that development is sustainable. But it has to be done; otherwise, the costs, as Cyclone Amphan has shown, will be massive and recurring.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/amphan-brings-a-message/story-eNvJn0AfZYbl4m0Lo6923M.html
