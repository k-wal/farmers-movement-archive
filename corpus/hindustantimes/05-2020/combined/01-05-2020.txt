01-05-2020||News||India is safe for all Indians, across all faiths||At the dawn of the enlightenment era in Europe, traditionalists were divided into two camps. One camp believed that universal laws are unchangeable and hence they should be considered supreme. The other camp of traditionalists insisted that since god is omniscient and omnipotent, only he is supreme. This second camp had spearheaded the anti-enlightenment campaign and become anti-West and anti-modernity. The West and modernity are not the same. But traditionalists continued to reject both because they are seen as going against their belief of the omnipotence of god. Such orthodoxy can be found in eastern religions too, but they largely believe in the omnipresence of the divine. Hence, they regard universal laws to be divine also.In the present coronavirus pandemic context, I am invoking this to highlight “God will save us” propaganda of some ill-informed religious leaders. The challenge today is not in tracking down Maulana Saad Kandhalvi, the head of the Tablighi Jamaat’s Nizamuddin Markaz. The real challenge is to encourage an unknown number of participants at the Markaz event in March who are hiding in different places, including in some mosques, to come forward. Several of them are foreigners. A number of participants at the Markaz tested positive and are undergoing treatment. But the remaining ones, who refuse to come out for voluntary testing, are a threat not only to themselves, but to the community and beyond.Besides the misplaced orthodoxy of the omniscience and omnipotence of god and the propaganda of a conspiracy against Islam, the other factor that is preventing these participants from coming out is the stigmatisation of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). But this is misplaced. It is just a virus for which the vaccine is yet to be found. Stigmatisation in the individual context will result in suffering for the individual. But if the stigma is extended to a community or a religion, it leads to larger consequences. Recall what happened in Italy. The initial stigmatisation of the Chinese as the carriers of the virus led to a reaction among the liberals of voluntary hugging and deliberate intermixing with the Chinese. The mayor of Florence, Dario Nardella, launched a “Hug a Chinese” campaign on February 1. While there is no conclusive evidence to show that the campaign was responsible for the rise of Covid-19 in Italy, it was an ill-conceived campaign at a time when social distancing should have been the norm.There will be a conservative reaction to stigmatisation too. If a community is blamed for it, then the reaction would be further ghettoisation. The radicals will get an upper hand. Those trying to communalise the discourse must understand this. What Maulana Saad did was akin to what Dario did in Florence. Around the time that the Markaz event was being held, people had voluntarily refrained from celebrating the most boisterous of all festivals like Holi. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had taken the initiative of cancelling Holi celebrations at his residence. Many other festivals such as Baishaki, Bihu and Vishu were all converted into private events. The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) cancelled its annual conclave of over 1,500 delegates in the second week of March for the first time in its history. But Maulana Saad decided to go ahead, and his decision had consequences.His thoughtless actions are what the majority of Indians are condemning. Efforts are on to locate and encourage the participants and those who subsequently came in contact with them to come forward for voluntary testing. Just as the Markaz and Maulana Saad don’t represent the entire Muslim community, a few reckless rants spewing venom against Muslims on social media don’t represent Indian society. It is here that the campaign about Islamophobia becomes misplaced and intriguing. Teaching tolerance to India is like carrying coals to Newcastle. Close to 200 million Muslims live in India. They live in peace, enjoying equal, if not preferential, treatment. No Indian leader has endorsed communal propaganda. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has upheld the unity of 1.3 billion Indians. The RSS chief, Mohan Bhagwat, said that: “If some people, out of fear or anger, refuse to follow the guidelines, it shouldn’t lead to blaming of their entire community”. He also decried efforts to create a wedge between the communities by cautioning, “Some people will use this anger to divide the nation. We shouldn’t allow that to happen. Every sensible member should come forward to encourage their respective communities to follow the rules”.India is safe for all its 1.3 billion people, including Muslims. We are all together in this fight against the virus. Unfortunately, we also face a challenge from a growing breed of “Modiphobes”. Many of them are Indian. For them, the removal of Article 370, which was applicable to Muslims, Hindus and Buddhists in Jammu and Kashmir, becomes an anti-Muslim act. The Citizenship (Amendment) Act, which doesn’t affect a single Indian, becomes anti-Muslim. This is because they are blinded by their hatred for Modi and so attempt to build a false narrative. And many well-meaning people end up falling for this.Ram Madhav is national general secretary, Bharatiya Janata Party, and director, India FoundationThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/india-is-safe-for-all-indians-across-all-faiths/story-S3Kcph3NFtK84dM0knyImM.html

The work to repair the 39-year-old bridge will start soon.Civic officials said the process would have taken around three months if lockdown was not in place. “The shutdown of railway services helped us complete the work without mega blocks. The construction of the new bridge will begin soon,” said an official. KDMC and Central Railway started dismantling the bridge on April 17 and completed it by April 30.“The repair of the rail overbridge will be undertaken by Central Railway, while the desk-slab work of the bridge will be carried out by the KDMC,” added the official.

01-05-2020||Mumbai||Post Covid-19: Shared mobility services to undergo changes||Shared mobility services, who were gaining traction in the city, will now take precautionary measures and adopt changes post-Covid world.Shuttl, a startup that runs an app-based bus aggregator service said that in order to adhere to social distancing norms, they have started numbering the seats in the buses.“Earlier, you could occupy any seat, but to ensure there is no proximity, we will provide seat numbers to commuters before-hand,” said Vishwas Singh, vice-president, Shuttl in a webinar organised by the World Resources Institute on new responses to Covid-19 lockdown, on Thursday.Yulu bikes, an e-bike service will continue its new model of Yulu Prive developed during the lockdown. Unlike shared mobility, the new model allows its customers to keep the bike with them for 15-90 days, in order to avoid sanitation issues. “We will regularly undertake sanitation of all bikes. The app will also show commuters when was the bike last sanitised before they choose to use it,” said Rajat Rawat, senior lead for government and corporate relations, Yulu.The micro-mobility services are active in delivering essentials during the lockdown period, Rawat said.The participants also stressed the need for government regulations on the operation of transport and not look at new mobility services at par with traditional services. Chand Tulal Mazumdar, public policy- India and South Asia, Uber said, “We have started a new vertical to look at the future of mobility. We will continue to look at tech-based solutions to provide safer travel.” She also said that the company’s UberPool services were suspended before the lockdown to ensure commuters’ safety.While there have been talks on people shifting to personal transport in the post-Covid-19 world for safer travel, the panellists said that there will be a section that won’t have the wherewithal to do that. “People will be left with lesser disposable income at hand post the pandemic. There will be a segment, which will need safer public transport services,” Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/post-covid-19-shared-mobility-services-to-undergo-changes/story-eC3GifqfR9QjXFaMmufjlJ.html

01-05-2020||Mumbai||‘Close contacts of Covid-19 patient were not tested for 48 hours’||Residents of a slum pocket in Govandi alleged that the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC)’s health team of M-East ward did not test symptomatic high-risk contacts of a Covid-19 patient for 48 hours.Four of the six locals, who helped the patient reach Rajawadi Hospital on March 24, had tested positive. The residents are alleging that the cry for help of these four locals was ignored by the civic body for 48 hours as no help was offered until these locals got themselves tested and were found positive.On March 24, a senior citizen from Panchsheel Chawl of Limun Baugh area had collapsed in her house as she was diabetic and was declared dead due to the virus at the Rajawadi Hospital two days later. The locals who helped her reach the hospital approached the BMC to get themselves tested as they were among the high-risk contacts. After waiting for more than a day and with no response from the health department, the six people looked for a nearby health camp and got themselves tested. They were found positive for Covid-19 on Thursday and were quarantined soon after.Shrushti Salve, a resident of the Panchsheel Chawl said, “We are appalled by the BMC’s handling of the health crisis in our area. Our slum is densely populated and we use common toilets, and yet the BMC took five days to set up a health camp in the area. The senior citizen died on Sunday and the health camp in the area was set up on Friday. Meanwhile, the four people developed some symptoms and had to get themselves tested. This is a serious lapse.”Denying their allegations, the BMC said that all arrangements of fever camps, screenings of people and sanitisation of the area is being done on a regular basis. Sudhanshu Dwivedi,assistant commissioner of M-east ward, said, “The health camps and screening of people are already in place. We cannot test asymptomatic people for a couple of days which is as per the guidelines. There are 12 health camps in the entire ward. We are scaling up the facilities and doing our best to contain the spread of the virus. Also, we are sanitising common toilets on a daily basis and we are managing all of this with limited manpower.”The residents further said that the family members of the senior citizen, who died due to Covid-19, were not tested until yesterday. They alleged that the family members were not called by the BMC for the tests and that they voluntarily got themself tested. Their reports are yet to come. Shankar Patil, another resident of the area, said, “Some of the family members have some symptoms since few days and were only tested on Friday when the health camp in our area was set up. The BMC did not take this seriously at first which has led to so many people getting infected.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/close-contacts-of-covid-19-patient-were-not-tested-for-48-hours/story-0Phh2y1XQIdKmGJBR2tmVN.html

The BMC, in the circular, has said that several front-line staff members including doctors, medical staff and all those involved in emergency work related to Covid-19, stay far off from their workplace, and are facing problems while travelling.The circular states that it cannot be ruled out that the front-line staff workers could get exposed to the virus while travelling daily to work and back home. All 24 wards have now been directed to prepare a list of hotels in their areas and book them for front-line staff workers. A rate slab has been issued, wherein, the BMC will spend anywhere between ₹500 to ₹2,000 for a room in several hotels including five-star hotels. Each room will accommodate a maximum of two officers.In a statement issued on Friday, the BMC said, “We had provided accommodation to several of our staff members in Taj Hotel after the hotel had approached us offering their services for free. However, it was decided to pay a minimal amount for the occupancy of the accommodation facilities to Taj Group, that was accepted by them without any conditions. Similarly, now we have decided to identify hotels for all front-line staff members, throughout the city, on the same lines.”The circular issued by the BMC has allowed the ward officers to identify such rooms in five stars, four-star, three-star and non-star hotels, for which the rate card has been decided. As per the card ₹2,000 per room with two persons in a five-star hotel, ₹1,500 for a four-star hotel, ₹1,000 for three hotels, and ₹500 for non-star hotel, will be spent.The statement added, “Due to lockdown, local train services are shut and several of our front-line staff members are coming from far off places, and for this, a lot of is spent on transportation.

01-05-2020||City||HC wants list of hospitals where outstation patients can be treated||New Delhi: The Delhi High Court directed the Centre and the Delhi government to provide a list of hospitals where hundreds of outstation patients could receive treatment for ailments other than Covid-19, free of cost, according to their eligibility, after a plea was filed alleging that these patients are stranded and not getting proper treatment.A bench of Justice Vipin Sanghi and Justice Yogesh Khanna issued notice to the Centre, the Delhi government and DUSIB on the plea by one Karan Seth who had contended that due to the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, AIIMS stands converted into an exclusive facility to treat Covid-19 patients. Consequently, these outstation patients are not being provided treatment at AIIMS any longer.The plea filed through advocate Darpan Wadhwa said that the patients are not being provided treatment free of charge at AIIMS or alternatively at any of the government hospitals. He also showed photographs to the court stating that the outstation patients have been housed in the shelters opposite AIIMS where the social distancing norms are not being followed.He submitted that many of these patients are suffering from serious ailments such as cancer, and their natural immunity is low, and some of these patients run the risk of contracting the Covid-19 Virus, if they continue to live in such conditions.Appearing for the Delhi government, its additional standing counsel, Anupam Shrivastava, told the court that the occupants of the shelters in the process of being shifted to Gargi School Building, which is stated to be located in Green Park Extension. It is also disclosed that as against the capacity of 568 persons in 11 such tents, 255 persons were being sheltered. He also assured the court that the issue of sanitation would be taken care of before shifting the patients and their attendants.Appearing for AIIMS, its counsel told the court that the main facility of the hospital is not exclusive for corona patients and other patients are being treated. He also stated that about 10 days back, a team of doctors from the AIIMS have visited the shelters and identified those patients who required hospitalisation, and two such patients were admitted in the departments of AIIMS.Following this, the court sought a status report in this regard. It also asked the authorities to give a list of the hospitals and posted the matter for further hearing on May 8.It asked the petitioner to prepare a list of patients in respect of whom the present petition has been preferred while highlighting that the list should include their name, age, particular ailment that they are suffering from and their medical ID cards issued during treatment by the government hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hc-wants-list-of-hospitals-where-outstation-patients-can-be-treated/story-CrsmxvrDjJg2GWds9z6v4N.html

01-05-2020||City||Ambala borders tightened as administration issues fresh restrictions||The Ambala district administration has enforced the curbs more strictly by restricting cross-border movement across all the borders with effect from Saturday.In an order issued by district magistrate (DM) Ashok Kumar Sharma on Friday, the administration banned the movement for any additional purposes (other than those exempted) without seeking permission and also asked people moving in and out of the district to make accommodation arrangements in order to avoid daily cross-border transit.“The persons working in Ambala will have to make living arrangements for themselves in the city itself while the residents of Ambala working in places outside the territory will have to pursue similar accommodation arrangements so as to preclude any cross-border transit,” said DM Sharma. In his order, Sharma said, “If cross-border transit becomes unavoidable, people will either have to install and use Aarogya Setu app or go through thermal scanning and symptomatic screening at border check-posts. “Symptomatic persons will be tested through the rapid testing facility. The conditions will also be applied to persons involved in exempted services,” the order said.“Further, the persons falling under a few exempted services and who undertake cross-border transit in and out of Ambala every day will be mandatorily quarantined in locations designated by the DM during the entire time from his return to Ambala till next travel back out of Ambala,” the order read, adding that the violators of the order will also be booked under relevant sections of law. The fresh restrictions have come at a time when the Ambala has not yet reached a stage of 14 days without a positive case and is surrounded by two Punjab hotspots: Patiala district and Dera Bassi’s Jawaharpur village that has recorded a maximum number of positive cases. As of now, there are two positive cases in the district, both undergoing treatment in Chandigarh. On Thursday, the administration also banned the residential entry of any outside person from other districts or states to the Ambala district.The order issued on Thursday read, “…in exercise of the powers given under Section 34 (c) of the Disaster Management Act-2005, the district authority prohibits the residential entry of people coming from other states and districts without giving proper permission of sub-divisional magistrate concerned or station house officer of thanas concerned and the Ambala civil surgeon.DM Sharma said, “Both the orders issued in consecutive days shall remain valid as both are for different purposes. The latest order is for people travelling to-and-fro from Ambala, while the Thursday’s order is for those who are coming to stay in the district.”“We have already banned the entry of farmers coming from Punjab to sell their crops in mandis of Ambala,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ambala-borders-tightened-as-administration-issues-fresh-restrictions/story-0mLH0eaEME6SKK5kNZU07K.html
01-05-2020||Mumbai||Polls for 9 council seats on May 21: ECI looks at modalities||Even as the Election Commission (EC) is tapping all options to conduct the May 21 polls to the nine seats of the legislative Council, which could facilitate the election of chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to the legislature, the ruling parties are in favour of electing the members unopposed, to avoid the cumbersome activities of polls amid lockdown restrictions and other precautions that would be needed.After the ECI on Friday announced the schedule for the elections, the state poll body started deliberations on the steps to be taken. The seats had fallen vacant on April 24 after the ECI postponed the elections in the wake of the Covid-19 lockdown.“We have at least two weeks to decide the modalities to hold the elections, following the norms of the lockdown by avoiding crowding. The ECI has directed the government to appoint special officers for compliance of the lockdown norms, besides which we could even think of holding the polls at the divisional or collector offices, instead of making 288 MLAs travel to Vidhan Bhavan. The discussion will be held in due course with the ECI,” said an official.Baldev Singh, chief electoral officer, Maharashtra, said the decision over the modalities will be taken soon.The Bharatiya Janata Party, with support from its smaller allies and independents, has 114 MLAs and can get four seats elected to the council against the three seats they held among the vacant seats. Three ruling parties –Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party and Congress- forming Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) has the combined strength of 169, including the support of their smaller allies and independents. The three ruling parties can go for five seats, one seat less than they held in the nine seats vacated last week.According to a leader from the Congress, the elections are likely to be held unopposed in the given situation and with the numbers with each of the parties.“It has been the tradition that whenever there is a big leader in the fray, the elections are held unopposed. Besides, the opposition has the exact number (114 MLAs) to get four seats elected, while the three ruling parties are short of at least five votes, if they decide to fight unitedly. Instead of indulging in a tug-of-war for additional numbers and inviting the threat of cross-voting, the ruling parties are likely to contest five candidates and avoid the elections,” he said. The required quota of votes per seat in the council election is 28.81 votes.“The NCP and Congress had two sitting MLCs each, while the Sena one in the nine seats. On the basis of their individual strength, the Sena can demand two seats as they have 58 MLAs required to elect two MLCs. Secondly, the Sena would want their leader and deputy chairman in the legislative council Neelam Gorhe to be reelected to the upper house, apart from Thackeray. In such a scenario, the Congress will have to compromise on one seat,” said a NCP leader.BJP’s Smita Wagh, Arun Adsad and Prithviraj Deshmukh retired on April 24, while NCP’s Hemant Takle, Anand Thakur and Kiran Pawaskar were among the nine MLCs to retire. The Congress’s Haribhau Rathod and Chandrakant Raghuvanshi (who joined the BJP ahead of the Assembly polls after resigning from the party) too had retired. Gorhe was the only Sena MLC to retire on April 24. The BJP is not expected to repeat its retired MLCs and may field Chandrakant Raghuvanshi along with some of its senior leaders who lost in the Assembly polls. The NCP is expected to repeat Hemant Takle, while the Congress may go for fresh faces.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/polls-for-9-council-seats-on-may-21-eci-looks-at-modalities/story-ye2Xhp6VxAHMslyWoWBN5J.html
01-05-2020||City||PUDA law officer’s appointment as OSD to local bodies minister sparks row||The Punjab local bodies department’s decision, in the middle of the covid-19 pandemic, to appoint Punjab Urban Development Authority (PUDA) senior law officer Abhijit Kumar, on deputation, in the state water supply and sewerage board has sparked a row. Sources claimed that the move was aimed to ensure that Kumar, already working as an officer on special duty (OSD) to the local bodies minister Brahm Mohindra since June 2019, can get his pending salary for the past eight months. PUDA had refused to pay the salary, saying Kumar had gone on deputation on his own.“As per norms, an OSD is appointed with the minister and not with department. PUDA, Kumar’s parent department, refused to pay his salary, saying that he had gone on deputation on his own. Now, without calling any applications from the department and without finance department permission, the local bodies secretary has issued fresh orders appointing Abhijit as senior law officer at sewerage board, which is against rules,” said a source, adding, “He will continue to work as OSD, all this has been done to draw his salary against the post of the law officer.” The source added that Kumar had not even completed his probation period as senior law officer, thus he can’t be taken on same post. Kumar, a resident of Patiala, is a voter of constituency of Mohindra, and is considered close to him. On January 10, 2020, PUDA chief administrator Dharampal Gupta had even withdrawn Kumar’s deputation with Mohindra by saying, “His services are needed in PUDA.” Mohindra took up the matter with PUDA minister in-charge Sukh Sarkaria, who restored Kumar as OSD to the minister, but still did not allow salary from PUDA. The first order for Kumar’s appointment as OSD was issued by the then local bodies secretary A Venu Prasad on June 14, 2019. In July, Mohindra had written a demi-official letter to Sarkaria, seeking that Kumar’s salary be charged from a vacant post of law officer at Greater Ludhiana Area Development Authority. PUDA, however, did not accede to this.When contacted, Kumar admitted that PUDA had once cancelled his appointment as OSD and that his salary had not been released. “Yes, the cancellation orders were issued in January. I didn’t join back as such orders were not conveyed to me. Later, the order was withdrawn,” he added.On his appointment on deputation in the sewerage board, he said “I am not authorised to comment.”Local government secretary-cum-chief executive officer (CEO) of the sewerage board Ajoy Kumar Sharma said, “Yes, the local government department has issued orders to appoint Abhijit Kumar as senior law officer on deputation. We will put it up before the next meeting of the board for approval.” On pointed queries on ambiguities related to the appointment, Sharma said, “I am just following orders that the local bodies department has issued.” Additional chief secretary Sanjay Kumar could not be contacted for comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/puda-law-officer-s-appointment-as-osd-to-local-bodies-minister-sparks-row/story-Mz2TqofvxH2xotEjx2Yw2L.html
01-05-2020||Mumbai||Are BJP and Shiv Sena witnessing a thaw in relations?||Is there a thaw in the relations between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) high command, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, home minister Amit Shah and Shiv Sena chief and Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray?With the PM and the Union Home minister stepping in to bail Thackeray out of the impending constitutional crisis, there is speculation that the relations between the former allies may improve. It is learnt that the option to seek permission from the Election Commission of India to hold the polls for the nine Vidhan Parishad seats postponed due to Covid-19 came from the BJP’s top brass in Delhi. Thackeray had called PM Modi on Wednesday and Union Home minister Amit Shah a day later to discuss the issue and seek their co-operation. With the Election Commission giving a go-ahead to conduct the polls, Thackeray once elected to the Upper House will get the entire term of six years as opposed to just two months of tenure he would have got if he was appointed under the Governor’s quota. The two vacant seats under the Governor’s quota have only two months of tenure remaining.“The suggestion to get the EC to hold the polls was given to the CM by the BJP’s leadership from Delhi as a better option than to get nominated through the Governor’s quota and again seek a permanent solution after two months. The CM reached out to both of them,” said a Sena leader.A former BJP minister said this meant the party leadership was willing to look ahead. “At the end of the day, the Sena has been bailed out by our PM. We are willing to look ahead. One can’t rule out future alliances at any stage.”Not everyone within both the BJP and the Shiv Sena camps are, however, willing to believe that this is a sign that frayed relations are set to improve. The former allies broke ties after Thackeray alleging betrayal (on the BJP’s part to split the CM’s post with the Sena) tied up with former rivals, the Congress and NCP, and formed the government in Maharashtra. The Sena leaders said their party would wait for Thackeray to get elected before commenting on whether the BJP-Sena relations have turned a corner. “There is no denying that in this case, they have co-operated with us. But we have not got much help from the Centre in tackling the coronavirus in the past two months. There have also been attempts to tarnish the Thackeray government as ineffectual when the contrary is true. There may be an attempt to stall the election by moving a petition in the court against the elections as well,” said a Sena leader. Former CM and leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis welcomed the governor’s recommendation on Thursday and tweeted: “We are sure that the ECI in consultation with Ministry of Home Affairs will take decision to conduct election ASAP. This will prevent Maharashtra from going into instability in the testing times of corona outbreak and will also uphold the values of our Constitution.”State BJP president Chandrakant Patil also put out a similar tweet. A senior BJP leader and former minister however said, “It may be too early to arrive at any conclusion. This is not the right time to play politics as public perception will go against us. This does not mean all is well or that will be in the forseeable future.”Political analyst Surendra Jondhale also said: “The Centre may not have wanted chaos at this stage. It would have reflected badly and turned perception against them, especially as Thackeray has gained some popularity. The entire episode reflects badly on the Governor who seemed to have bypassed his statutory responsibility. He waited for two weeks to give any response and then gave the task to the ECI after party top brass blessed the move.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/are-bjp-and-shiv-sena-witnessing-a-thaw-in-relations/story-85mshHfKrJzRHZmDBAmMcI.html
01-05-2020||Chandigarh||HC stays MD/MS counselling in Haryana||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Friday stayed counselling for admissions to postgraduate medical courses in Haryana.The HC bench of justice RK Jain and justice Jaswant Singh passed the order on the plea of Dr Vikram Pal and others, who had approached the high court challenging the April 15 notification on the procedure for admission to MD/MS courses with details about reservation in various categories. The counselling for 156 seats was scheduled to be held on May 4 and May 5. They had argued that the reservation in any case could not go beyond 50% as laid down by the Supreme Court in Indra Sawhney case in 1992. The HC was told that reservation went up to 87% as per the notification put out by the Haryana government. A response from the state has been sought by May 6.The government had reasoned that 25% seats for institutional preference and 5% seats for the physically handicapped as well as 10% for the economic weaker section category should not be counted and if these categories are excluded, the reservation does not cross the cap of 50%.However, the bench observed that their response does not substantiate the argument as petitioners had demonstrated that out of the total 156 seats, the open category seats have got reduced to 31 only.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hc-stays-md-ms-counselling-in-haryana/story-2RW4NNVUEm8TbpdTTt82SN.html

The procedure to apply for the financial aid started on April 30.“We have a record of the devotees who have earlier made any kind of donation to the mandal, be it ₹11 or ₹100. Those who have given donations are eligible to apply for the scheme,” said RG Bhatt, trustee of the mandal. People from the committee who are in touch with the donors will inform them about the scheme and the announcement has also been published on social media.“We are a trust and in difficult times, it is our duty to help devotees of Bappa who have always believed in him as a wish-fulfilling idol,” said Bhatt.The mandal had earlier provided financial help of ₹5,000 each to 800 people from the community. “Ganpati mandals have so far donated an amount worth ₹35 lakh to the Chief Minister’s Fund.

01-05-2020||Chandigarh||Workers departure in conflict with intent to resume economic activity in Haryana||The mass movement of stranded migrant labourers to their homes may not pose an immediate challenge to the enterprise, but remains a cause of concern for the industrial establishments in Haryana.Entrepreneurs and industry captains in the state believe that the central government’s decision to facilitate the passage of migrant labourers to their homes is in conflict with the decision to allow industrial and commercial establishments to resume economic activity. Industrial associations hope that labourers would come back to work after reuniting with their families.Panipat-based exporter Amit Goel said he couldn’t comprehend the government’s decision to allow migrant labourers to move back to their native places at this time when it wants to revive the economy.“The government should facilitate maximum permissions to run the factories, thus enabling almost all labourers to get work. They can stay and earn at their current places till the situation normalises completely,” Goel said.Chairman of Haryana chapter of PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry Mohit Jain said the situation warranted framing of policies which facilitated retaining the migrant workforce. “There are no jobs in their home states. It’s not prudent to send them back as they will become a burden back home. If they are helped to stay back and work, it would give them economic stimulus and restore their purchase power,” Jain said.Gurgaon Industrial Association president Jagan Nath Mangla said the impact of loss of labour will be only realised once the industries start working at full capacity. “Even Maruti Suzuki India Limited has not started manufacturing activity till now. Till the time supply chain is restored from end to end and showrooms open, the production of goods will remain suspended. The loss of migrant labourers won’t hurt the industry instantly, but we are concerned about long-term effects,’’ Mangla said.P K Jain, a former chairman of PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said that present situation is driven by confusion. “A pandora’s box has been opened. How will the production chain run if there are no workers available? Then those who are looking for jobs are confused because of this exodus rhetoric,” Jain said.Gurugram-based auto parts manufacturer Yogesh Munjal said the loss of migrant labour may cause some short-term problems for the enterprise. “I think once they go home, they will be more inclined to come back as there are no jobs back home,” Munjal said.DEEMED APPROVALS FOR INC IN 14 DISTRICTSMeanwhile, in an effort to ease resumption of industrial activity, the Haryana government on Friday allowed deemed approval for industrial establishments in 14 districts. To be eligible for deemed approval, the industrial establishments will have to make self-declarations for complying with the standard operating protocols (SoPs) provided by the Union home ministry.Industrial units in 14 districts – Ambala, Bhiwani, Charkhi Dadri, Fatehabad, Hisar, Jind, Kaithal, Karnal, Kurukshetra, Mahendergarh, Rewari, Rohtak, Sirsa and Yamunanagar – will get immediate self-generated approvals within moments of application being submitted on the SARAL portal, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/workers-departure-in-conflict-with-intent-to-resume-economic-activity-in-haryana/story-IPYzqveN1T9q31ZovlWUkL.html
01-05-2020||Mumbai||State calls off annual waterhole census for the first time in 3 decades||The Maharashtra forest department has decided to cancel the annual waterhole wildlife census this year across all national parks, wildlife sanctuaries and tiger reserves in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. The census was scheduled to take place on May 7.The waterhole census is a citizen-science conservation exercise focusing on close interaction with nature and it is the first time in 30 years that it has been called off, said Nitin Kakodkar, principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife), Maharashtra forest department. “Even if it is done with just our staff, at least two persons would be required to stay at each location across all sanctuaries, increasing the risks during the current Covid-19 scenario. As far as scientific inference, we are not dependent on this exercise for wildlife estimation,” said Kakodkar.Since it is easier to spot animals during the full moon in summer, the census is conducted annually on Buddha Poornima when forest officers and volunteers keep vigil on waterholes atop machans (platform erected on a tree or at a height from the ground). Last year, 591 animals, including leopard and deer, were spotted at Mumbai’s Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP) by 85 volunteers and 80 forest staff.Tourism activities across all 49 wildlife sanctuaries including tiger reserves, six national parks as well as protected forests in Maharashtra have been stopped until further announcement, said Kakodkar. “All bookings stand cancelled. Due to this, animals have been occupying areas, including those dominated by humans where they are not normally seen,” he said.TADOBA ONLINE SAFARI GETS 20,000 DAILY VIEWS DURING LOCKDOWN The forest department has been uploading daily digital tours of Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve in Chandrapur (at www.mytadoba.org) during the lockdown. “The medium has got over 11,600 subscribers and has been getting 20,000-plus views per day since the third week of April. The idea is to provide a glimpse of the wonders of this reserve that citizens may be missing out on, but have still access to from the comfort of their homes during the difficulty of the lockdown,” said Nitin Kakodkar, principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife), Maharashtra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/state-calls-off-annual-waterhole-census-for-the-first-time-in-3-decades/story-meZz3XtpFtP7rVq3Zp6pUL.html
01-05-2020||Chandigarh||Interest benefit scheme to support MSME approved by Haryana cabinet||The Haryana cabinet has approved a scheme to support MSME and help these units pay wages to employees and retain them. The scheme will remain in force for three months after its notification. Additional Chief Secretary, Finance, TVSN Prasad said that as per the Haryana MSME revival interest benefit scheme, all MSME units as on or before March 15 will be eligible for 100% interest benefit on loans availed for payment of wages to employees. This interest benefit will also be available on other expenses up to Rs 20,000 per employee for six months, Prasad said.The interest benefit will be calculated at the rate of maximum 8% per annum or actual interest rate charged by the bank / financial institution on term loan/ working capital loan, whichever is lower. To avail the benefits of this scheme, the industrial unit should have been in commercial production for at least 80% of days between February 1 and March 15, 2020. The unit should have filed industrial entrepreneur or Udyog Aadhaar memorandum after coming into commercial production. It should obtain or have obtained term loan or working capital loan from a bank or financial institution during the lockdown period within one month from the date of getting permission to restart or till June 30, whichever is later.In case a similar incentive is extended by the central government to the MSME units, then only incremental benefit will be provided to the units.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/interest-benefit-scheme-to-support-msme-approved-by-haryana-cabinet/story-c8C4fQKqNZIjbBmnA9TrqN.html
01-05-2020||Mumbai||Government intervention needed for labourers to live with dignity, say experts||As migrant workers continue to be the worst-hit owing to the Covid-19 lockdown, the call for re-imagining migrant lives post the pandemic grew louder on May 1, International Labour Day. Various organisations working with migrant communities demanded immediate measures to address questions regarding the livelihood of the workers.“Sending them back home is not addressing the problem. It is a band-aid solution,” said Roshni Nuggehalli, executive director at Mumbai-based NGO Yuva. “The government has to work with the unions and organisations to plan both, short-term and long-term solutions that will help the migrant population live with dignity,” she said.Aajeevika Bureau, an organisation that works in the states of Maharashtra, Rajasthan, and Gujarat, chartered a pathway for migrant-inclusive urban governance that can be adopted by the government. In its report ‘Unlocking the Urban: Re-imagining Migrant Lives in Cities Post Covid-19’ released on Friday, it stressed on various measures, including enumeration of migrant settlements, legislation to fix employer responsibility, and migrant inclusive public health care.Divya Varma from Aajeevika Bureau, in a webinar on Friday, said, “Migrant communities are left unenumerated, which excludes them from urban planning as their settlements are not recognised. Plus, there is a sedentary bias as they migrants cannot claim domicile.” The organisation stated that post-Covid-19, one can expect migrants to be forced to work for even lower wages and in more exploitative conditions in urban areas.Sitaram Shelar, from the organisation Pani Haq Samiti, which has been demanding universal access to clean water, said, “Providing universal social security and legislating minimum wages is a must for them to live with dignity. Another major demand that we have been talking about is providing some sort of shelter or a habitation centre for the migrants, who live in deplorable conditions.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/government-intervention-needed-for-labourers-to-live-with-dignity-say-experts/story-oIPp1YAwC0lSYO70pfp2GP.html
01-05-2020||City||Gurugram: Smaller units can run operations, says Haryana govt||Gurugram: The Haryana government’s latest direction on Thursday to resume industrial operations across the state had paved the way for smaller units, which have less than 10 workers, and those which have workers on the project site or at factory premises, to function across the state. The government also said that out of the total of 22 districts, permission to large business units in 14 districts that are in the green zone can be obtained at the click of a button through the government’s Saral portal. However, for the remaining eight districts of the state, including Gurugram, permission to operate large units would have to be sought from the district administration.“For industries, commercial establishments and construction projects employing less than 10 workers in any of the 22 districts of the state, there is no need to seek permission from the state government and these units may resume operations subject to social distancing norms and other requirements, mentioned in MHA (ministry of home affairs) guidelines”, said a government notification issued Thursday.Permissions in eight districts -- including Gurugram, Faridabad, Palwal, Nuh, Sonipat and Panipat -- would be based on the number of coronavirus (Covid-19) cases identified in a block, zone or town; if the number reaches 10, the permission to operate will cease, said a government spokesperson on Friday.Also, business units in all 22 districts of the state having labour on site would be allowed to operate, with all the workers present in their premises, as per standard operating procedure (SOP), the order said.TVSN Prasad, additional chief secretary, Haryana, who drafted the revised guidelines for industrial and commercial establishments, issued after a cabinet meeting on Thursday in continuation of the previous guidelines of April 19, said: “In a district like Gurugram, which is a sensitive zone in light of Covid-19, the administration has to assess block-wise cases. In case in any block, 10 coronavirus cases have come up in the last 28 days, all permissions will be withdrawn from industries. This is a clear guideline and the district administration has to assess this.”The decision to grant permissions on the basis of block-wise assessment has, however, left business and industry owners dejected as they were hoping that change of Gurugram’s status from red to orange zone will bear positive results and eliminate the need for permissions. Though owners welcomed the decision of the government to let run smaller units without added permissions, they said there was no clarity on how the workers will travel to work and from and who will issue passes for them.Giving some hope, VS Kundu, chief executive officer, Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority, who is also the monitoring official for Covid-19 in the district, said that they will facilitate permissions to industries faster in line with the directions of the state government. “We will try to accelerate the process so that industry and business owners can resume operations, as it is crucial for the workforce to earn their livelihood,” he said, adding that an additional option will be soon made on the Saral portal for permissions to industrial units. City-based industrialists, however, said they want more clarity from the government on whether industrial units below 10 persons can resume operations without the intervention of the administration or not. They also want the government to clear the confusion among industry owners who said they want “proper and clearer” guidelines for a sensitive district like Gurugram.“Though Udyog Vihar comes in Gurugram block which has Covid-19 cases, not a single case was found in this industrial township. The parameter of 10 cases in a block is harsh; we will have to shut down our industries and send back all workers and then wait for directions from the government,” said Sanjiv Puri, a garment export business owner.A group of industry owners, who called on officials of the department of industries and commerce (DIC) in the city, also said that they did not get any definite answers regarding resumption of industrial units.“Although we were told that companies with less than 10 workers can start operations, it is not clear who will issue passes. There is a need for more clarity on the issue,” said Deepak Maini, chairman, Industrial Development Association, Sector 37.Industrialists also said that with the Delhi border sealed and strict curbs on movement, it is difficult for even those workers who have valid passes to reach Udyog Vihar or units in Manesar. “We have sought clarifications from the government regarding the status of industry in the city in light of this notification,” said JN Mangla, president, Gurgaon Industrial Association.They say the guidelines issued by the government have also unnerved them as if businesses do not resume operations within seven days of permission, the permit will be withdrawn and the firm will be sealed.Ashok Kohli, president of Chamber of Industries, Udyog Vihar, said, “This is a very confusing guideline. We do not know if these guidelines allow us to resume operations or are asking us to wait for the Covid-19 virus to subside.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-smaller-units-can-run-operations-says-haryana-govt/story-ynCA7IYCUuNHhRx9h2MkvJ.html
01-05-2020||Chandigarh||Migrants on the move, industry in Punjab stares at fresh trouble||Ravaged by the six-week long national lockdown, the industrial units in Punjab have been struggling to rev up after the Centre eased the restrictions to reduce economic pain.Of the 2.52 lakh registered industrial units in the state, only 4,188 (1.65%) have resumed production with limited capacity so far and several others are working on getting permissions to reopen.But they are now headed for more trouble as lakhs of migrant workers, who have kept the industrial engine in the state running for decades, are preparing to return home to be with their families.The first clear indication of exodus of migrants, who have been without work for weeks and exhausted their meagre savings, was given by none other than chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh who on Thursday indicated that 10 lakh workers, including 7 lakh from Ludhiana alone, would need transport to go back to their home states. A majority of these workers are from Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand.The spectre of mass movement of migrants has left the industry shell- shocked.PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry mentor RS Sachdeva said that entire industry, including those units which have reopened to manufacture essential goods or provide such services, would be hit severely.“There is contradiction in what the government is saying and doing. They are telling industry to reopen and then seek special trains to send workers to their homes,” he said.In the state’s industrial hub of Ludhiana, it is being seen as a further setback to the cycle, hosiery and auto parts industry. “Units manufacturing bicycles, which are around 4,500 in number, will start operating from Monday. We will be functioning with 50% labour as per government guidelines. We are already battling financial crunch and now fear that the labour that was available will also go away. The decision is certainly not to our benefit,” said DS Chawla, president, United Cycle and Parts Manufacturers Association (UCPMA).For the labour-intensive hosiery industry with 15,000 knitwear manufacturing firms (small and medium-scale) across Ludhiana, the months of May and June are the peak season when they manufacture stuff for winters. “Once the labourers go away, they will not return any sooner. It will be a matter of survival for us and the government should have thought before taking such a decision,” said Vinod Thapar, chairman, Ludhiana Knitwear Club.But not everyone feels this way as restrictions are not likely to be removed fully and factories will not be allowed to work full steam until the virus spread is stemmed.Ludhiana, Jalandhar and Patiala, home to 50% of the registered industrial units in Punjab, have been classified as red zones where limited activities and relaxations have been allowed by the Centre with strict restrictions.Rahul Ahuja, chairman, CII Punjab, said industry would be hit but not much. “There are many who are planning to reopen. I think 65% industrial units will restart operations in coming weeks. Therefore, it does not make sense for workers to go back. Also, it is unhealthy to travel in present situation. The returnees from Nanded are a case in point,” said the industry leader. Upkar Singh Ahuja, president, Chamber of Industrial and Commercial Undertakings (CICU), and an auto parts manufacturer, said there would not be much impact on auto parts industry as market was shut. “Even if we start manufacturing, we have 50% labour and a number of factory owners are finding it difficult to pay wages to the labour,” he said.The state authorities are hopeful of getting the industries back on track sooner than later. Industries director Sibin C said industry was apprehensive about workers going back but all-out efforts were being made to facilitate resumption of industrial activities as per the norms. “If they do not start operations and give them work and wages, we cannot keep workers here. There will be labour unrest,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/migrants-on-the-move-industry-in-punjab-stares-at-fresh-trouble/story-cDzsxnb2Ba9COkdJrOWqJJ.html
01-05-2020||Chandigarh||Fresh Covid cases in new areas giving Chandigarh administration nightmares||Early containment measures of the administration appear to have failed ever since the coronavirus started entering new territories in Chandigarh.Since April 25, positive cases have been reported in the densely populated Mauli Jagran, Ram Darbar and Sector 52, areas that were earlier Covid-free. As these cases were linked to the infected health workers at the Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, the health authorities had claimed that the situation in these localities was well under-control.A major cause of worry for the administration, however, was the discovery of fresh cases in erstwhile unaffected area of Sector 15 and resurgence of a new case in Sector 38 (where earlier two cases were reported but were cured) that have no links to the existing Covid patients.For instance, a 79-year-old lady who stays with her husband in the B block of Sector 38 had no travel history, and the couple stayed mostly indoors. Her case came to light when a neighbour took her to the Government Multi-Speciality Hospital in Sector 16 on April 27 after she developed mild symptoms. Since then, 13 of her family contacts and 222 community contacts are being intensely monitored.“The situation in the area is under control, but the positive case of an old lady who hadn’t been going out much even for buying essentials is a sign of worry. It may be indicative of the fact that the virus is somewhere in the community, which needs to be identified at the earliest,” said an official involved in contact tracing, seeking anonymity.PANIC GRIPS SECTOR 15Considered one of the safest areas, panic has now gripped Sector 15 after a 67-year-old resident of Block A was found positive early Friday morning.While the UT officials in the media bulletin claimed that the source of infection was being investigated, a close family member of the patient told the Hindustan Times that the man had no travel history. He had only been going out occasionally to buy essentials from the market, the family member said, on the condition of anonymity.The Sector-15 man was admitted in the emergency ward of the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) on Thursday 4pm after he complained of chest pain. He was later shifted to the advanced cardiac centre, where he was sampled and later, tested positive, said the kin.Surinder Sharma, president of Sector-15 resident welfare society, said, “After the case (came to light), the police blocked two-three lanes around the infected person’s house and MC vehicles sanitised the area. But my appeal to the UT is that they should conduct intense screening and testing, otherwise the situation may spin out of control here,” he said.19 AREAS UNDER WATCHTo begin with, the virus in Chandigarh was restricted to only a few areas like Sectors 19 and 21. The cases reported here were mostly the primary contacts of the girl who returned from the UK in mid-March, the city’s first positive case. But the virus gradually spread its wings in as many as 19 areas (see box).As of now, there are no active cases in sectors 19 (2), 21 (5), 29 (1) and 35 (1), but the biggest concern for the administration is the Bapu Dham Colony, where the number of infected cases has crossed 37, followed by 16 cases in Sector 30B.Another slum area, Kachi Colony in Dhanas, appears relatively safer now. After one positive case of a PGIMER health worker reported on April 18, no fresh case has emerged here.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/fresh-covid-cases-in-new-areas-giving-chandigarh-administration-nightmares/story-umMOLbf8OsCqOmCLVyyO2I.html
01-05-2020||City||Covid-19 effect: NHAI projects take a hit as Delhi-Gurugram border sealed||Gurugram: As the Haryana government sealed the Delhi-Gurugram border on Friday morning to contain the Covid-19 spread, several projects of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) in the city have taken a hit. Officials of the NHAI contractor for Ambience Mall underpass project said that as they are working close to the Delhi-Gurgaon border, the restrictions have slowed down the pace at which the work had resumed on April 24. RK Contractor, which has the contract for Ambience Mall underpass and Shankar Chowk elevated U-turn, said that its site office is located at Sirhaul toll on the Delhi-Gurgaon the expressway and it is not able to take machinery from one part of Sirhaul to the other (Ambience Mall) side. Kunal Garg, project manager, RK Contractor, said, “We have a construction site at Sirhaul toll where there are machines. With the border restrictions in place, how are we supposed to take the material and machines from the construction site to the other side where Ambience Mall underpass is being constructed?” With the lockdown in place, the only U-turn below the Delhi-Gurgaon expressway back to Gurgaon at Rajokri was closed by the police in March itself. Taking machines and labourers from the site office to the construction site has become a big issue for the contractor. “Before the lockdown, our workers would take a U-turn below Rajokri towards the construction site, now this has stopped,” added Garg. Similarly, contractor for the Sohna elevated road, between Badshahpur and GD Goenka University in Sohna, faced difficulty in procuring machine parts for one of their vehicles on Friday. Kuldeep Rajvanshi, project director, HG Infrastructure, NHAI’s contractor for the project, said, “There is a cutting machine which broke down and the parts are available in Delhi. Now, with the Delhi-Gurgaon border sealed, we are not able to procure the parts. This eventually has hit our work.” NHAI officials in Gurugram said that contractors can show the working permission to the police for their movement. However, it is up to the police whether to allow them to cross the border, they said. The Gurugram police said they are following district administration orders issued on Thursday evening restricting the movement of vehicles on the border with Delhi.

According to officials, there are hundreds of stranded students in various educational institutes of Gautam Budh Nagar.The district administration is circulating an online form for students to fill in their details and apply for the permission to go back to their hometowns.The move has been taken on the orders of the UP government, the officials said. “As per the orders of the state government, we have initiated measures to identify stranded students and to send them back to their hometowns. All the required arrangements will be made for such students to reach homes safely. We have circulated the online form for students to apply. Once we receive all the applications, we will be able to identify the exact number of students who need to go back,” said Suhas LY, district magistrate, Gautam Budh Nagar. Police commissioner Alok Singh took a meeting with officials concerned to ensure that the medical screening of all the students who need to go back should be done properly. Meanwhile, the state government has directed to increase the number of Covid-19 care beds in Gautam Budh Nagar. The health department officials in Lucknow have given their estimation of number of beds that can be increased at Sharda Hospital in Greater Noida, Super Speciality Paediatric Hospital & Post Graduate Teaching Institute in Sector 30, and the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) in Greater Noida.As per the list of the state health department, Sharda Hospital can have 400 Covid-19 care beds while currently, it has 200. GIMS has a capacity of 150 such beds and it has around 25-30 right now. The paediatric hospital can have a capacity of 50 beds and it has already achieved the number, the health department said. The district health department has also roped in the ESIC Model Hospital in Noida to use it as a Covid-19 hospital, but it will be used only if the situation demands, the officials said, adding that similar tie-ups have been done with Kailash Hospital and Jaypee Hospital in Noida.“We have got the idea about increasing the number of beds at the three Covid-19 hospitals from the state government officials. We are doing an audit to finalise the number of beds, which will be increased in each hospital. Currently, we have around 300 isolation beds ready in the district and there is no scarcity of beds. We have also roped in other private hospitals to make arrangement, if the situation arises,” the DM added.Meanwhile, senior officials of the Gautam Budh Nagar administration said on Friday that the lockdown restrictions will not be eased in the district and further decisions will be made as per the directions of the state government as the countrywide lockdown in red zones has been extended by two weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gb-nagar-admin-chalks-out-plan-to-send-stranded-students-to-hometowns-more-covid-19-beds-to-be-set-up/story-eSrY0jHhBpDHcHt749Z4DN.html

Officials said that it was the first instance in Ghaziabad when a Covid-19 patient died, though she didn’t die due to the deadly virus. “The woman’s son at the Hindon cremation ground was asked to perform last rites in a PPE kit. The formalities to get the body from the hospital and taking it back to the cremation ground took time. But it was the first such case for us and we were taking up every documentation and precaution. Besides our officials, only three members from the family were present,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer.Meanwhile, the district on Friday reported five more Covid-19 cases, taking the tally to 71. So far, 44 patients have been discharged from different hospitals after being cured, the officials said.The woman, who died on Thursday, was admitted to Yashoda Hospital on the morning of April 29 and her Covid-19 samples were taken the same day. A day later, she succumbed to heart stroke a few hours after her test results confirmed her positive for Covid-19.“She had comorbid conditions and high sugar levels. We had put her on ventilator support, but she succumbed. The cause of her death was heart stroke, but she was also found positive for Covid-19. The area where the patient was admitted has been shut for 72 hours and all sanitization procedures have been taken up,” said Dr Sangeeta Garg, chief medical superintendent of Yashoda Hospital.Meanwhile, the victim’s son said he now faces an uphill task to protect his family as he has two little daughters -- one four-month-old and another six-year-old.“My mother had come in from our native town of Tundla in December as my wife was expecting a baby in January. Then, my daughter was born and my mother stayed with us. She never went out but contracted the Coronavirus infection. My biggest worry is about securing my family now, and we would request the health department to make us stay in home isolation. Otherwise, I have called up two other relatives who will be with my family in case I am sent to a quarantine facility,” he said.The family stays in the Vijay Nagar’s Sector 12 area.Govind Yadav, president of the RWA, said that the area was not sealed or sanitized till Friday afternoon.“There were about 8-10 persons who had helped bring down the woman to the ambulance from the second-floor flat in the building. All these persons, including her family members, need to be tested at the earliest,” he added.The CMO said that he will try that the family stays in home isolation while following social distancing norms.“There are other rituals which the family has to perform after the death. So, we will consider letting them in home isolation, but with strict isolation. Tests of all those, including local residents, who came in contact with the woman will be conducted soon. The sanitization procedures have been taken up,” Dr Gupta said.On Friday, Ghaziabad reported five new positive cases, the officials said.“The five patients include a head constable of Delhi Police from Vaishali, a woman from Vasundhara, a man from Raj Nagar Extension, a quarantined patient, and another man who is a government employee. In all, our active cases stood at 27,” CMO added.According to the district administration officials, on Friday, they de-sealed eight epicentre areas -- SCC Sapphire high-rise in Raj Nagar Extension, Gyan Khand I (Indirapuram), Shipra Sun City (Indirapuram), Sector 2B at Vasundhara, Shalimar Garden Extension 2, Sector 6 at Vaishali, Oxy Home high-rise at Bhopra, and Khatu Shyam Colony at Duhai. Currently, there are a total of 17 hot spots in the district -- 15 in red zone, and two in orange zone, the officials said. The district magistrate on Friday also gave directions to the health department to increase the number of sampling.“We have directed for door-to-door mandatory sampling of persons who have symptoms and living in hot spots/epicentre areas. Such areas should also have random sampling. Contact tracing is to be enhanced as we are already getting police surveillance support. Sampling from community areas should also be taken up on daily basis,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/last-rites-of-covid-positive-woman-performed-amid-strict-precautions-five-more-cases-emerge/story-CGQq6SbSJ5L7wRXxwQGUCJ.html
01-05-2020||City||Ghaziabad moves to Orange zone, officials want more focus on sampling and speedy testing||Even as the Union ministry of health moved Ghaziabad district from the highly restrictive Red Zone (hot spot) to the comparatively relaxed Orange Zone, district health department officials said that the situation is dynamic and can change in case more cases come up. The officials said that the rate of testing should be sped up in order to check the exact number of cases present in the district.On Friday, Ghaziabad reported five fresh cases, taking the total to 71.According to the central government guidelines, districts with high load of coronavirus cases or which have a high growth rate of the disease are classified under the Red Zone. On Friday, while extending the lockdown that started on March 25 for two more weeks, the Union ministry of home affairs said that the state government could demarcate additional areas as Red or Orange Zones, but could not lower the classification as noted by the Centre.According to a communication from the Union health secretary, Preeti Sudan, to all the chief secretaries of states and Union Territories, all the states will have to delineate the containment areas and buffer zones in the identified Red and Orange zones and notify the same.According to the list, the state of Uttar Pradesh has 19 Red zones, 36 Orange and 20 Green Zones including Gautam Budh Nagar under Red zone and Ghaziabad now moving to the Orange zone.“Ghaziabad moving to Orange Zone is still a temporary phase and we need to focus more on sampling and speedy testing. We have the capacity to take up about 400-500 samples per day with the help of 40 lab technicians with us. But testing needs to speed up as we are getting test reports in 2-3 days from Meerut and there is also long delay in getting reports from Noida. We have reports which are pending since April 21,” chief medical officer Dr NK Gupta, said.According to official records till Friday, the Ghaziabad district has a list of 3012 samples sent for testing while about 484 were pending. On the other hand Noida has sent 3618 samples till Friday.“The focus should be on tracing more cases to get the exact picture so that proper surveillance and containment can be taken up,” Gupta said.To move to the Green Zone (with no cases), Ghaziabad will have to keep the momentum it is on, while at the same time increasing sampling, surveillance and containment.“Ghaziabad moving to Orange Zone is a dynamic situation and it can change if more cases come in. The labs were limited when coronavirus outbreak happened and now more testing labs are added. If test pendency is more than a week then the purpose of sampling gets defeated. The state government is making efforts to increase testing. We also need to curb floating population and lot will also depend on nearby areas like Delhi,” said Dr AK Paliwal - state program manager from National Health Mission (UP).On April 15, the Union health ministry designated districts as Red, Orange or Green zones based on cumulative cases reported and also their doubling rate.According to the latest list, the districts have been designated across the various zones by broad-basing the criteria.“The classification is multi-factorial and takes into consideration incidence of cases, doubling rate, extent of testing and surveillance etc. The doubling of positive cases in Ghaziabad is estimated to be in two weeks which is higher than the national average of about 11.2 days at present. The district’s peak was reached when cases related to Tablighi Jamaat came to light. Since then we have 2-3 cases coming in,” Dr Paliwal added.District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said that he was awaiting directions from the state government after the Centre on Friday evening decided to extend ongoing countrywide lockdown for two more weeks.“The district moving from Red Zone to Orange Zone is a thin line. But we are focussed on getting more samples tested. Our patients who got discharged from hospitals is more than the total number of active cases. We are also putting curbs and checks on inter-city movement of commuters in order to prevent medically acquired infection. Our efforts are on and we are trying our best to move to Green zone,” Pandey added.The Ministry officials in their communication added that for district having one or more municipal-corporations, the areas under these bodies and other areas of the districts may be treated as separate units.“If one or more of these units have reported no cases for last 21 days, they can be considered as one level lower in zonal classification, in case the district is in Red/Orange Zone. District authorities should, however, exercise due caution in such areas so that these areas remain free from Covid-19 cases,” the letter said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-moves-to-orange-zone-officials-want-more-focus-on-sampling-and-speedy-testing/story-89LnHpbjKjIHiVvxh5jU7M.html
01-05-2020||City||Covid-19 lockdown: Jobless migrant labourers start cleaning works in Sector P-3||GREATER NOIDA: A group of migrant labourers, who are dependent on others for food after being rendered jobless due to the Covid-19 lockdown, have started cleaning footpaths, pruning trees and other similar works in Sector P-3, as they think taking ration from the residents for free is not ethical.About 1,100 families are living in plotted houses in Sector P-3, and 400 unfinished houses, most of them in dilapidated condition, are lying vacant. In some vacant houses, about 500 daily wagers from states such as West Bengal, eastern UP, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh are staying, said office bearers of the Sector P-3 residents’ welfare association (RWA). Since the lockdown started, the RWA has been providing dry ration to the labourers. After a month of staying jobless, these labourers decided to work for the residential area.“We have not faced any problem here as people of this society provided ration to us. The only problem is that we are not getting work due to the lockdown. We thought if the society is providing us food for free, then we must give them back. And we started cleaning lanes and footpaths, and the weeding work in the area,” said Babu Lal, a daily wager from Chhatarpur district of Madhya Pradesh.Parshuram, another labourer from Chhattisgarh who goes by first name only, said, “After staying indoors for more than a month, we feel happy while working in the sector. Taking ration for free was neither ethical nor good for our self-respect,” said the labourer. In the beginning, only eight labourers started the cleaning works. But now, 15 labourers are engaged in the job, and more want to join them, the RWA said.“After this group started work, many others are also coming to work. It is good to see that labourers think of self- respect. As they work, we have made sure that they follow social distancing rules so that they stay safe from Covid- 19 risk,” said Manoj Bhati, president of Sector P-3 RWA.Greater Noida has at least 60,000 estimated migrant labourers, who are rendered jobless and depending upon the authority for food.“This is a good thing that labourers do not want to take food for free. During this time of Covid-19 pandemic, such acts give hope for our society,” said Alok Singh, a social activist and founder member of Active Citizen Team of Greater Noida.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-lockdown-jobless-migrant-labourers-start-cleaning-works-in-sector-p-3/story-Y0nQL5mDi9mpXMvLQ3oLYI.html

01-05-2020||Chandigarh||Education department seeks explanation from 15 schools over fee collection in Chandigarh||The Chandigarh district education officer (DEO) has sought explanation from 15 schools after complaints regarding fee collection were filed against these schools. This comes days after the Independent School Association (ISA) wrote to the UT education department to let them collect fee as they won’t be able to meet the financial obligations, including payment of salaries. However, when the education department asked schools to display their balance sheet online, none of the schools complied with the directions. Following the complaints of the parents’ association, the education department on April 24 had passed an order directing all the unaided private schools to ensure that income and expenditure accounts and balance sheets are uploaded on their websites by April 30, 2020, under the provisions of the Regulation of Fee of Unaided Educational Institutions Act, 2016. However, even as the extended deadline of April 30 has passed, none of the unaided private schools have uploaded their balance sheets until now. DEO Alka Mehta said, “After the complaints were received, we asked the respective schools for an explanation. Most of them said that it was a technical glitch and the schools that had asked for fee, rolled back their previous orders.” “Since the fee collection was rolled back, we did not issue a show cause notice to any school and no further action was taken,” she added.Regarding uploading of balance sheets online, Mehta said, “Majority schools allege that they do not have access to any accountant during the lockdown while other schools have simply not replied. No school has so far displayed its balance sheet online. I will send them a reminder soon.”The education department in April had deferred payment of tuition fees for the 2020-21 sessions in government and private schools. It said that the dates will be announced later and a month’s time will be given for payment. However, the private schools at their wits’ end over the directive to delay collection of school fee, had written to UT administrator VP Singh Badnore demanding that the education department either withdraw the directive on delayed fees payment or pay salaries of all private school employees of Chandigarh as well as Punjab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/education-department-seeks-explanation-from-15-schools-over-fee-collection-in-chandigarh/story-Wk2ilPYTjUDqA0IeGKvmRO.html

It is this back-breaking capacity to work from dawn and beyond dusk of the migrant labourers that used to be at the core of paddy transplantation across 32 lakh acre in the state.But this year, Haryana farmers may have to manage the show largely with the local labourers if the Bihar and UP workforce that is still staying back decides to rush home due to the fear of coronavirus before paddy transplantation begins on June 15.“We will take a call on this issue one month later as by that time, picture will be clear. Paddy transplantation picks up momentum in the first week of July. By then, hopefully, the situation might improve,” Jai Parkash Dalal, agriculture minister, said.“Let’s remember that there was shortage of labourers during the wheat harvesting, which is a much bigger operation. It has been managed very well. Paddy transplantation labour is different that comes in middle of June. Koi naa koi intjaam karenge (We will arrange something).”Paddy is largely grown in Karnal, Kurukshetra, Kaithal, Yamunanagar, Panipat, Ambala, Fatehabad, Sirsa, Sonepat , Hisar, Rohtak, Faridabad and Palwal districts.The paddy growers admit that absence of labourers from Bihar and UP will cause problems, but it will not hamper the activity completely as local landless labourers and daily wage earners are available in abundance due to lockdown.“It is too early to start worrying if labourers will come or not,” said Nirmal Singh, a farmer from Karnal’s Indri. He quipped, “Earlier, people were worried how wheat will be harvested. There was no labour shortage as local workers were out of job and they played a crucial role in manual harvesting and management of wheat chaff.”Endorsing Nirmal’s views, Raj Kumar of Kurukshetra’s Ladwa said, “There was no shortage of labour due to lockdown during wheat harvesting. This year, we paid ₹1,600 per acre for the management of wheat chaff against ₹1,800 paid last year.”However, a leading paddy grower, Mahavir of Tohana in Fatehabad, disagreed. “In my region, labourers from Bihar are not available. We will face serious issues. They are expert in transplanting paddy,” Mahavir, who owns 22-acre land, said. However, according to Balbir Singh of Fatehabad’s Daulatpur village, local labourers cannot match paddy sowing skills of those from Bihar and UP.Most of the farmers HT talked to said labour shortage was not as serious an issue as it appeared. “Local labour is available in plenty,” was the common refrain of the farmers.They said large number of migrant labourers, who come for the harvesting of sugarcane, are still staying back. Also, local landless workers, who are jobless due to lockdown, could play a bigger role the paddy transplantation. “We don’t depend entirely on the migrant labourers for the paddy transplantation. Local brick-kiln workers also do the job in our area,” said Jagmal Kamboj, a farmer from Ratangarh village in Yamunanagar. And, an elderly farmer, Prithvi Chand of Yunispur village of Karnal district, agreed. “If labourers from Bihar are unable to come, the out-of-job local labourers are available in plenty. Haven’t we harvested wheat?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/cautiously-optimistic-haryana-farmers-say-local-workers-available-in-plenty/story-smtxxkFQ5Qjz4iZ5u9CjjL.html

01-05-2020||Chandigarh||WHEAT NORM RELAXATION: Amarinder urges Paswan to withdraw ‘unjustified’ value cut||Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Friday wrote to Union minister of consumer affairs and public distribution Ram Vilas Paswan, seeking immediate withdrawal of the “unjustified” value cut imposed on wheat growers in lieu of relaxation in procurement norms due to luster loss and shrivelled grain.The CM had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on April 28, seeking a review of the decision to safeguard the interests of state farmers.Demanding Paswan’s prompt intervention to re-examine the issue to protect the farmers’ income, Amarinder said the imposition of a value cut on the earnings of the farmers for reasons beyond their control is unjustified.Amarinder apprised the Union minister about two important demands raised by the state government during an earlier discussion with him – the relaxation in wheat procurement norms for shrivelled grain/lustre loss and the release of administrative and arhtiya charges, which had been acceded by the ministry.He said the issue of relaxation in norms for wheat without value cut had not been addressed so far. “These cuts are completely unreasonable since there were unseasonal (spells of) rain in the state in March, and the farmers were unable to take preventive measures for saving the wheat crop as a result of lockdown across the country,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/wheat-norm-relaxation-amarinder-urges-paswan-to-withdraw-unjustified-value-cut/story-uiCCNoEsjry8pwFF6q2ZDJ.html
01-05-2020||Chandigarh||Not the right time to score brownie points, Punjab CM to opposition||Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Friday appealed to opposition parties not to trigger panic among people by spreading misinformation about the covid-19 pandemic. “There was no mismanagement of the crisis or widespread infection in the state, as is being project by the SAD and the AAP. Most cases were those coming from the other states,” the CM said, in an address to the state’s residents. He added that people should not worry about the sudden spike in numbers that could be expected over the next few days as more people return to their homes from other states.“Of 100 new cases reported, only seven are related to local infection, while 93 were Punjabis who had come from outside the state,” he said, adding that all political parties must realise that this was not the time to score brownie points, as the situation was akin to a war. “It is a war for Punjab and its people. Wars can only be fought and won unitedly. As Punjab is going through a difficult time, there is a need for all to work together to save the state and its people.”While clarifying that every person returning to the state would be kept in institutional quarantine as a preventive measure, he appealed to the people not to be afraid of it. “It is just a means to ensure that the returnees do not spread the infection among their families, neighbours or others,” he said. On the return of people of other states stranded in Punjab, he said the states concerned would have to make arrangements or the Centre would have to arrange special trains, given the large numbers involved.He added relaxation during the curfew/lockdown would start falling in place as deputy commissioners finalised plans for area-wise opening of select shops.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/not-the-right-time-to-score-brownie-points-punjab-cm-to-opposition/story-AjhR9CaS1EmmgyaQrVxHlO.html

He had several comorbidities. The total deaths in the city are 12.”On Friday, Thane recorded the highest single-day spike of Covid-19 cases for the second consecutive day after Thursday’s 31 cases. With 34 new cases, the total number of cases in the city is 344.The increase is in the slum areas, which TMC has attributed to random sampling.Malvi said, “We have undertaken preventive measures in CP Taloa area of Wagale Estate. Fever patients were screened and random testings were done, so the number of cases here has increased.”Rate of recovery is good: TMCThane Municipal Corporation has claimed that the rate of recovery is 20% more than the rate of infection in the city. Malvi said, “Sixty-nine patients have recovered so far. The rate of recovery is 20% more than the rate of infection. This is due to the isolation of infected persons in hospitals and quarantine institutions.”Free treatment for poor at Horizon Hospital TMC has said that those having yellow and orange ration cards will get free treatment under Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Arogya Scheme at Horizon Prime Hospital in Ghodbunder.Malvi said, “The poor will get quality treatment with free nutritious food and other facilities.

01-05-2020||City||Seal Covid-19 clusters, open other zones to kick start economic activity, say Chandigarh residents||Put the onus on people to follow safety measuresChandigarh is a city of educated people who have followed the lockdown religiously for their safety. Social distancing and hygiene practices have already become a norm. Declaring the entire city as a containment zone when many sectors haven’t reported a single case has caused lot of resentment and disappointment. Each sector can be considered a separate unit and allowed to start functioning independently because each has its own market. The affected sectors can be sealed and disinfected regularly till zero cases are reported.Dr Priya Mahajan, ChandigarhChain of infection has to be brokenYes, sensitive pockets and areas should be identified and included under containment zone. We are well past the stipulated period to break the chain of infection. People should continue with all the precautions and social distancing. Violators including VVIPs should be dealt with strongly and booked under relevant provisions.Rajeev WaliaPublic inconveniencedIt’s not fair to declare Chandigarh as a containment zone. Only small, affected zones can be marked as such. It causes great inconvenience to the public, particularly daily wagers, small vendors and private salaried class.TBS BediServices, businesses should openThe least the administration can do is seal the most affected areas. In the others services and businesses should be allowed to operate with all precautions and less staff. Kamal SahniOne size does not fit allIt is not prudent to declare the entire Chandigarh UT a containment zone as one size does not fit all. Nonetheless, the blame for lapses leading to it lies squarely on overconfidence and casual approach of citizens in apprehending the nature and gravity of the pandemic. It is cruel to ban all activities alike in all areas. Prime minister Narendra Modi has aptly stressed the need to strengthen the economy while continuing with the fight against Covid-19. Collective wisdom of the Union government with wide feedback from far and near, will guide the graded lockdown exit for restarting services and businesses depending on the intensity of the disease or its eradication, in different areas and sectors in due course of time. Success of the mission depends on that of citizens’ agenda of strict self-regulation vis-a-vis adopting social distancing and personal protection. The onus lies on one and all to help end this period of trial and tribulations sooner than later.Lalit Bharadwaj, PanchkulaExtend ban on large gatheringsDeclaring a city is a containment zone means increasing frustration levels of the residents. By now the people are very aware of the restrictions and safety measures to be adopted to prevent Covid-19 so the government should relax all the norms in the city and restart semi-essential services. However, sector wise curfew should be extended and public spaces such as marriage palaces and restaurants should be closed. Delivery of essential and non-essential items, including food, should also be allowed. Special restrictions should continue in the villages and colonies which have a very large number of Covid-19 cases.Avinash GoyalSanitise buildings, limit number of workersChandigarh is the capital of Punjab and Haryana, so to declare it a containment zone would not only halt its growth but also that of the two states. The city should be opened up slowly and carefully. First of all, special guidelines should be initiated for the safety of both the consumer and the producer. There should be limits on the number of workers employed in certain departments and shops. Markings should be done on the floors of all working areas to facilitate social distancing. Proper and regular sanitation of all public places should be done before lifting of restrictions. Even factories producing non-essential items and shops selling them should be allowed to function, to ensure that people’s financial status stabilises. Only those people who have self-isolated for a month should be allowed to work.Naunihal Singh GillEase restrictions, obey ordersIt is too early to think about easing restrictions, but declaring the entire city as a containment zone will not serve any purpose. Rather, the administration and the health department should carry on upgrading the infrastructure to face unwanted situations. Nevertheless, it’s the duty of the civilians to obey the advisories to keep Covid-19 at bay. We should also keep in mind that vaccines for treating the disease have not been developed, so avoiding infections is the best option.Surinder Paul Wadhwa, MohaliRestart businesses in phasesSealing of pockets of infection seems to be a good option. Businesses should be opened in phases depending on their nature and necessity. Small and medium scale businesses and shopkeepers should be allowed to open in the first phase. Initially, there should be rebate on cess, taxes and fixed charges from the administration. Manufacturing units should also be opened after taking appropriate precautionary measures with proper social distancing norms followed by the citizens. Those found violating norms should be named and shamed publicly.Madhur SharmaRole of citizens crucialThe number of hotspots in the city indicates that the Covid-19 patient count is not very high. The areas where cases have been reported have also been swiftly contained by the authorities. However, now the role of citizens is a principal concern. The time has come when everybody has to give up their regular habits to efficienty execute their services, mode of operation of businesses, public dealings and commuting, by maintaining social distancing at every level. We should also keep ourselves updated on the latest news, authenticated articles, and be responsible when it comes to social media use. Dev Raj Veer Singh, MohaliSave daily wagersIn order to save daily wagers it is essential that the city be divided into three to four zones according to police station or sub-divisional magistrate jurisdictions and the most affected ones remain closed with commercial activities allowed in others by following precautionary measures.Suresh Verma, ChandigarhContinue working from homeAt this juncture it seems almost impossible to remove Chandigarh from the containment zone list. People of the city are more concerned about their health instead of their businesses and work. The best option seems to be working from home. Opening up businesses won’t make sense as around 80% of the raw material is obtained from factories located in other areas.Priyam Aggarwal, ChandigarhMonitor colonies on peripheryEconomic activities cannot be postponed any more in spite of the Covid-19 threat. Educated citizens of Chandigarh are following the norms of the lockdown. They have donated money even beyond their capacity to coronavirus funds. The colonies on the periphery need close monitoring and testing lest they become virus hubs like Delhi. Strict action should be taken against the violators of restrictions. Let shops dealing in both the essential goods and sundry items remain open for three to four hours.Usha Verma, ChandigarhComplete lockdown will destroy economyCovid-19 is a disease that most of us, including experts, don’t understand. So declaring Chandigarh a containment zone is not based on scientific facts. In countries like Germany and India the death rate is low. So for a very small minority we are keeping everyone in lockdown. A good positive is that many asymptomatic people have the virus despite remaining healthy. They should be tested with the virus strain identified and used to build ‘herd immunity.’ Complete lockdown will slowly destroy the economy. The daily wage earners are suffering already. So we need to start opening up businesses and services gradually and keep the elderly, those with underlying conditions and the ailing protected. Farming and industries have to be started. S Michael DurairajBlanket restrictions counterproductiveWe have learnt a lot about the Covid-19 pandemic and realised that there are a number of factors responsible for the lower fatality rates in our country, which includes higher level of immunity, genetic reasons, food habits, BCG vaccination etc. A large percentage of people have been found asymptomatic even after getting infected. In my opinion blanket restrictions at this stage will only prove counterproductive, especially for the economy of the country. People are now fully sensitised to the problem and can live with Covid-19 by following basic precautions. The government also issued revised guidelines not to seal the whole building but the only floor where Covid-19 cases had been detected. Similarly, infected patients will also be categorized and those with mild symptoms allowed to quarantine at home. Considering all of this, there appears to be no need to declare all of Chandigarh as a containment zone.Paramjeet Singh, ZirakpurLift curfew, impose Section 144Chandigarh has had a very sharp surge of cases in last few days. We see no respite from the lockdown. But here are some suggestions to keep Covid-19 cases under check while allowing economic activities to resume. The city should be divided in zones and sectors adjacent to areas with a high rate of infections should be in the orange zone. Curfew should be lifted in other zones and section 144of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC), prohibiting the assembly of four or more people in an area. to be imposed instead. The Industrial Area has seen no case so far, economic activities should resume there with one-fourth of work force. Non essential shops should open for restricted hours and public movement for restricted hours allowed . Noor Malhotra, ChandigarhResidents should act with utmost restraintSafeguarding lives against Covid-19 is a priority, therefore, declaring Chandigarh a containment zone is prudent. However, the effectiveness of this crucial curb would depend on each citizen taking full responsibility to strictly follow the Chandigarh administration’s orders concerning lockdown/curfew. Residents should act with utmost restraint to stay back home and follow adequate standard of personal hygiene. Services and businesses should be started in a phased manner so that social distancing is maintained and people protected. Improvements for the next phase should be introduced on the basis of the feedback of the previous one(s). The police and volunteers should keep a strict watch on service providers, businessmen and the public to ensure that all advisories are followed.Dr SS Bhatti, Chandigarh||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/seal-covid-19-clusters-open-other-zones-to-kick-start-economic-activity-say-chandigarh-residents/story-2g1LcsIJ8fd2JvIxgx6dMP.html
01-05-2020||City||Farmers in Punjab worried as labour shortage casts a shadow over paddy transplantation||Paddy transplantation, scheduled to begin in Punjab on June 20, is heading for a possible crisis due to labour shortage. The state farmers need at least 12.5 lakh labour heads to sow paddy over 75 lakh acres over a month.Amid the lockdown imposed due to the Covid-19 pandemic, chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh has hinted that 10 lakh migrant workers would go back to their home states in the coming days leaving behind a big void.The state government tried to retain them by setting special camps, but only 2,300 migrant labourers turned up to stay in these camps. After a bumper yield of wheat this year, Jarnail Singh of Bathinda’s Naruana village is worried about the availability of labour for paddy transplantation. He owns five-acre land and was planning to take three more acres on lease. But the pandemic has marred his expansion plan. “Workers from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar had been sowing paddy for me for several years, but they are out of access now,” he said.Joginder Singh Ugrahan, president of Bhartiya Kisan Union (Ekta-Ugrahan), said there is a widespread anxiety among the growers regarding availability of farm labour. He also demanded permission to start sowing as early as June 1 to grant paddy growers a wider time window to complete sowing by mid-July.Gurdeep Singh a farmer from Bajak village of Bathinda, demanded inter-district movement of labourers. “I have nine acres to sow non-basmati rice varieties, but non-availability of workers will land me in big crisis. The adjoining district of Muktsar has a group of Punjabi labourers trained in paddy sowing. The district authorities should relax restrictions to allow movement of such workers,” he adds.MECHANISED SOWINGHowever, the government is now looking at mechanised sowing as an alternative to the manual plantation. Secretary (agriculture) Kahan Singh Pannu expressed the hope that paddy sowing in the state would shift from the labour-intensive transplantation to the mechanized sowing this season.Referring to the trials conducted by the Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) during the past five years on direct seeding rice (DSR) varieties, Pannu said sowing is done with machines and it has shown encouraging results.He added that the government is offering 40% subsidy on DSR machines. “The number of machines may not be sufficient to sow paddy across the state, but it would set a new trend,” he said. “The yield of DSR varieties and paddy transplanted on fields with puddle of water during the trials has been the same. In fact, the new method is beneficial to farmers as it needs less irrigation,” he said, while adding that they would issue an advisory in this regard to the farmers.“We still have 50 days left with us. Hopefully, we would deal with the issue,” he said.Talking to HT, PAU vice-chancellor BS Dhillon said, “Now is the time to move away from traditional methods of paddy transplantation. We have made a prototype of a machine for DSR. More such machines could be manufactured and supplied to farmers.”Dhillon said the machines manufactured during these days may not cater to the entire state, but they would mark the beginning of a good start for paddy sowing. He advocated use of happy seeders and zero-till drills for paddy sowing. EXPANSION OF COTTON, BASMATI, MAIZE TO CUT PADDY AREAPannu said the agriculture department has planned to increase the area under basmati, cotton and maize so as to reduce the area under paddy.He said cotton would be grown over 12.25 lakh acres this season as compared to last season’s 9.5 lakh acres. Similarly, the area under maize crop will increase from 4 lakh acres to 7.35 lakh acres and that of basmati from 16 lakh acres to 18.35 lakh acres. “This will reduce the area under paddy by at least 8.5 lakh acres. Accordingly, the requirement for labour will also be less.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farmers-in-punjab-worried-as-labour-shortage-casts-a-shadow-over-paddy-transplantation/story-28ZKMthAxmYwvGG6LMnZFK.html
01-05-2020||Delhi||Central varsities’ students traumatised by protests and violence, now stress over uncertain future||Shruty Yadav, a final-year undergraduate student of Jamia Millia Islamia, is worried not just about the Covid-19 pandemic, but also about finishing her assignments without having “much clue about her future”.“We are flooded with assignments and are still not very clear on what the university plans to do about our final year exams. We’ve heard exams will take place in July and, yet, we are being asked to do multiple assignments in every paper unlike previous terms,” she said.Yadav is among thousands of final-year students across the three central universities in the national capital who are uncertain about their future course of action. “I don’t even know why I filled the application form for further education and why we are giving money to colleges. There is little clarity on anything,” she says from her home town in Bihar.Yadav also pointed out that students are also dealing with the “stressful environment” at home during the lockdown. “Our families are also stressed because of their work. It is a difficult situation to be in or explain to them that we are using our laptops and phones for studies and not leisure,” she said.For students of Jamia Millia Islamia and Jawaharlal Nehru University, the academic crisis this year has been more severe as these varsities were shut for months due to strikes and protests.Last year, JNU students began an indefinite strike from November to protest against the proposed hostel fee hike which they said would push marginalised students out of the system. The three-month-long agitation came to an end in January. Jamia, on the other hand, was shut after protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act near the varsity took a violent turn on December 15 last year. At both universities, students were only able to attend classes for a few weeks before the Covid-19 lockdown was announced in March, leading to suspension of classes again.Shairik Sengupta, a final-year postgraduate student of JNU, said, “In the past six months, we have only had regular classes during February and a couple of weeks in March. After students returned to classrooms following the hostel fee hike protest, we thought we had the entire semester to make up. Instead, the Covid-19 crisis happened and we had to switch to online learning almost overnight. Students did not sign up for this.”The MSc student also said this is the first time that he is going through a teaching-learning process, which is completely online. “We have been unable to prepare for competitive exams since it is not easy to navigate through online learning so quickly. Many students may not even opt for their PhDs this year since there is very little resource to prepare for the interview or tests,” he said.Poor internet connectivity or the complete lack of it has added to the woes of students. “Many students did not take books back home. They do not have easy access to e-resources. In addition to this, they have to study for their final year while battling the trauma of being attacked inside their own university,” said Akhtarista Ansari, a final-year undergraduate student at Jamia, while referring to the December 15 incident when police had entered the campus, allegedly to nab miscreants.The 19-year-old added that the recent arrests of Jamia students in connection with the northeast Delhi riots have left many stressed. “Students are randomly being called for interrogation. There is an atmosphere of fear and concern. How are we expected to study and submit our assignments amid all this?” she said. Last month, at least two Jamia student activists were charged under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA).Jamia media coordinator Ahmad Azeem said, “We have formed a mental health committee and have made helpline numbers available for students in case they need any help.” Similar initiatives have been launched by DU and JNU as well. JNU registrar Pramod Kumar said the varsity had put up videos and helpline numbers on their Covid-19 portal for stress management.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/central-varsities-students-traumatised-by-protests-and-violence-now-stress-over-uncertain-future/story-UiTAWXTd98QeB6mwuHJhPO.html

01-05-2020||Delhi||Mayurdhwaj Apartments de-contained; no new case reported in 28 days||The Delhi government on Friday de-contained Mayurdhwaj Apartments in IP Extension, Patparganj, in east district after no new Covid-19 case was reported from the society in the last 28 days, bringing down the total number of containment zones to 96. The gated society, which has 105 flats, was declared a containment zone on April 3—after a resident was brought dead to the Shanti Mukund Hospital, was tested for Covid-19 and his sample tested positive. The deceased person was on dialysis and used to visit the hospital periodically.“Four weeks after being sealed under operation Shield, Mayurdhwaj Apartment in East Delhi is being de-contained. No new cases found. Congratulations to the health team and all residents,” Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Twitter. District administration officials said they had conducted repeated surveys and health checkups of all 303 residents in the society and their tests came out negative. “Active surveillance of the area and vicinity was done by the CDMO (East) for 28 days. No new cases emerged, hence Mayurdhwaj Apartment was de-contained as part of scaling down process,” district magistrate east Arun Kumar Mishra said.In his de-containment order, Mishra said that medical authorities shall continue follow up operations and the usual lockdown restrictions will remain in place.The HT, on Tuesday, had reported that Mayurdhwaj Apartments could be one of the four containment zones which could be de-contained by May 3 as fresh cases of Covid-19 had not surfaced. On Thursday, the Delhi government had scaled down restrictions in three containment zones—Shahjahanabad Society in Dwarka, Vardhman Apartment in Mayur Vihar-1 and a sealed lane in E-block of East of Kailash—after no new Covid-19 cases were reported in any of these areas in 28 days. Earlier last week, the Delhi government has de-contained Mansara Apartment in Vasundhara Enclave. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/mayurdhwaj-apartments-de-contained-no-new-case-reported-in-28-days/story-0YkNTsmmwceTDYgzuDnauK.html

He has alleged that he is not being given proper treatment at GMCH, Amritsar.“Many pilgrims have returned from Takht Huzur Sahib in Nanded, Maharashtra. And all of them are being tested positive for Covid-19 in Amritsar. We had taken samples of health workers who were collecting samples of the pilgrims or have come in contact with them. The 22 year old has been tested positive for Covid-19 on Friday. He may have been infected from the Nanded pilgrims,” said Amritsar civil surgeon Dr Jugal Kishore, adding that they will test all health workers and administration staff who have come in contact of Nanded-pilgrims.“Health workers are given personal protective equipment (PPE) kits for collecting samples of people as any person can infect the medical staff. Meanwhile, samples of his father, mother and wife have also been collected,” Dr Kishore added.The NHM worker, who was working as a lab technician at the health centre in Lopoke in district, shot a video from the isolation ward of GMCH and circulated it on the social media. The NHM worker said, “The health department had collected my samples as a precautionary measure on Thursday and told me on Friday that I am tested positive for Covid-19. They admitted me in the isolation ward but no one is giving me any treatment.”While sharing his video on Twitter, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader Bikram Singh Majithia said, “With 6% mortality rate, which is the highest in country, the video exposes the condition in state in treating and handling Covid-19 cases. Captain saab, are we waiting for a disaster to happen?”Meanwhile, a staff nurse, who was present on duty in the isolation ward of GMCH, alleged that the 22-year-old patient spat on her. “He spat on a staff nurse after which we made him understand that he needs to calm down. Sympathising with his condition, we have decided not to lodge an FIR against him,” said additional deputy commissioner (ADC) Himanshu Aggarwal.Medical superintendent of GMCH, Dr Raman Sharma, said, “There is no specialised treatment for Covid-19 patients. Only the symptoms are treated. The patient is asymptomatic. Our doctors and nurses are available 24 -hours in the isolation ward and are taking care of every patient. The NHM worker is aggressive and was panicky on hearing that he has tested positive of the disease. I personally met him and he is stable.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-nhm-worker-tests-positive-in-amritsar-accuses-hospital-authorities-of-not-treating-him/story-KKZ1cSi0FdeCjBPvIyuqzK.html

As a result, we are deprived of our daily earnings,” said Krishan Lal, a migrant worker from Bilaspur in Chattisgarh.“Around 20 days ago, a few officials had distributed ration to us and afterward did not bother to enquire about us,” said Babita, Lal’s wife.Another labourer Raju said, “We are neither getting dry ration nor any work. And, we cannot go back to our homes. We request the government to send us back.”Raju said that the government should run special trains to send stranded migrant workers back to their homes. “Though the government is trying to help us by providing dry ration and ₹1,000 a month, it is not sufficient to sustain this lockdown. This is the toughest phase of our lives,” he added.An official said that the government was trying to help the migrant workers with dry ration but there was a huge demand.“Even the first phase has not completed yet as they are a scattered population but we are still trying to reach out to them,” he said.On Thursday, Jammu and Kashmir lieutenant governor approved a relief package of ₹350 crore for people affected by the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown that included construction workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/migrant-workers-in-j-k-urge-government-to-run-special-trains-to-send-them-home/story-64Tsvzf9l4LdB9av5QSBUO.html
01-05-2020||Delhi||3 policemen suspended for lying to evade duty amid Covid-19 outbreak||Three Delhi police constables, who were on duty at Shastri Park metro police station, were suspended on Thursday after they allegedly lied that they had come in contact with a policeman who had tested positive for Covid-19 and therefore should be sent into home quarantine.Senior officers said, once caught, the constables confessed that they were scared of catching the infection while on duty and therefore made the excuse to evade duty amid the pandemic. Their suspension is yet to be revoked, police said.A senior officer said that on Wednesday, the three constables had informed the east district control room that they had worked closely with a sub-inspector, who allegedly later tested positive for the virus. “When officials from the control room checked with their police station in Shastri Park, it was found that they were lying and that they had cooked up the story. The matter was then reported to senior officers,” said a police officer, who did not wish to be named.Deputy commissioner of police (railways) Harendra Kumar Singh said when the three constables were caught lying, they said they were apprehensive about going to field duty amid the virus outbreak. “As a disciplinary action, they were all suspended from their duties. Their suspension is yet to be revoked,” the DCP said.Meanwhile, four more Delhi police personnel tested positive for coronavirus on Friday, taking the total number of infected policemen to 40. Two of them - a head constable and a constable — are members of Delhi Police’s crime branch, which is probing Tablighi Jamaat head Maulana Saad and his associates in connection with the religious congregation in a six-storey building in the Nizamuddin area in March, in violation of government orders. The policemen were sent to isolation and are under treatment. Their family members have been asked to quarantine themselves at home, said a senior officer who did not wish to be named.The two others, both constables, who were also tested positive on Friday are from Khajoori Khas police station. The two men were living in the police station barracks with four other constables from the reserve force. The police are now getting the other four also tested for coronavirus. On Thursday, a Delhi Police sub-inspector from Amar Colony police station — whose duty was at Okhla Mandi — had also tested positive for Covid-19.Of the total 38 police personnel infected with the virus so far, five have already recovered and have been discharged from quarantine facilities they were admitted to.The five discharged policemen include three constables from the Chandni Mahal police station, one assistant sub-inspector (ASI) from the traffic police unit and his batchmate, who was deployed at the AIIMS Trauma Centre police post.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/2-policemen-suspended-for-lying-to-evade-duty-amid-covid-19-outbreak/story-Eks0XbiI1Aw76yo7Pr4dxJ.html
01-05-2020||Delhi||Cramped quarantine facilities for health care staff give rise to fear of Covid-19 spread||A day after the Delhi government released its home isolation guidelines, many health care workers’ unions have expressed concerns over doctors and nurses in several Covid-designated hospitals being quarantined in hostel facilities where these isolation rules are difficult to follow. Joint Federation of Nurses, a collective of nurses working in Delhi-NCR, on Friday wrote to the Delhi government, highlighting the problems of shared bathrooms and common utensils in hostel facilities, making it difficult for health care professionals, who are either tested positive of the virus or are awaiting their results, to maintain isolation.“We have asked the health department to move health care workers who have either been diagnosed with Covid-19 or are awaiting test results, to be moved to alternative accommodations where they can follow quarantine rules and not risk infecting others,” said Mini Joseph, joint secretary of the union.Joseph said several health care professionals working in high-risk departments are being accommodated in hostels even during their quarantine period. With many doctors, nurses and lab workers being tested positive for the contagious disease in the national capital, the fear of health care workers infecting others is increasing, she said.So far, 293 healthcare professionals in Delhi have tested positive for Covid-19. The guidelines released by the Delhi government on Thursday said that if a person is tested positive for the disease, they can be home quarantined, provided they have the “requisite facility at their residence for self-isolation”. Many doctors and nurses working in Covid-19 designated hospitals have pointed out that common bathrooms and utensils in hostels defeat the entire purpose of quarantine. They asked that even those in who are in quarantine and yet to confirm positive should be given isolated quarters till they receive their results.A resident doctor in Delhi government’s Lok Nayak Hospital, who completed her quarantine last week, said every corridor in the hospital comprises between 10 and 12 rooms and has a common washroom.“I had to step out in desperation because there was no other way. Thankfully, my results returned negative, but I could have infected several others with me because there was no other option. One doctor in the hostel was tested positive and was shifted to the hospital after the results came, but till then the doctor was here with all the other residents,” she said, on the condition of anonymity.A senior Delhi government official said that ‘home isolation’ is being allowed only on a case-to-case basis after examining whether the patient can fulfil the prerequisite conditions of self-isolation in their residence.“If a health care professional is tested positive and resides in a hostel then we will shift them to hospitals. Their health and care is important to us. And the issue of alternative accommodation for those in quarantine is being taken up with hospital administrations,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/cramped-quarantine-facilities-for-health-care-staff-gives-rise-to-fear-of-covid-19-spread/story-itp22keyxjGZQpP8tvRM9K.html
01-05-2020||Delhi||Universities deliberate on implementing UGC’s exam recommendations||A day after higher education regulator University Grants Commission (UGC) listed its recommendations to mitigate the academic crisis due to the nationwide Covid-19 lockdown, three central universities in the capital—Delhi University, Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), and Jamia Millia Islamia—began deliberations on how to implement them in their institutions.While Jamia and JNU have decided upon a tentative arrangement for conducting their semester or annual examinations, Delhi University (DU)—which has over 90 colleges affiliated to it—is yet to come out with a plan. The UGC, while providing a basic framework, has allowed universities to modify and adapt the recommendations as per their need.Jamia’s media coordinator Ahmad Azeem said, “The university has decided to hold the examination of our final-year students as per UGC recommendation during July 1-15. The exams will be conducted at the varsity while following proper social distancing measures. However, if the situation demands, we are also ready to hold the exams online. For the intermediate students, who will spend another year or semester at the varsity, we will mark them on multiple internal assessments.” HT had earlier reported how the varsity was asking its students to submit five 20-mark online assessments and pick the best of three among them for their final score. JNU vice-chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar on Thursday said that the administration has forwarded the UGC guidelines to all its schools and centres. “The schools and centres have decided to follow a suitable model relevant to their specific needs so that students can complete their academic requirements without delay,” he said.Last week, JNU had already allowed all its schools and special centres to hold midterm and semester examination via the mode of their choice. Of 13 schools, five decided to go for the online mode. The rest will hold offline exams after the lockdown. The School of Environment Studies started conducting its midterm exams online this week.Members of the DU’s task force—constituted to look into the academic situation during the pandemic—held a meeting on Thursday to discuss the implementation of UGC recommendations. “The UGC recommendations are well thought out, keeping the current scenario in mind wherein nothing is certain. We have already extended our teaching session till May 15 and will work on the new academic calendar as well. So far, the focus is on exams and admissions, and we will make a decision soon after fulfilling necessary statutory requirements,” Payal Mago, joint dean of colleges and a member of the task force, said.Several principals of DU colleges have also expressed concern about conducting the academic sessions since the upcoming ones will also see an increase in the number of seats for the 10% reservation for candidates belonging to Economically Weaker Section (EWS) category. The university had planned to increase its intake by 25% to facilitate the quota in two phases: 10% during the 2019-20 academic session and 15% for the 2020-21 session. Manoj Khanna, principal of Ramjas College, said, “The entire trajectory of the academic session needs to be redefined. Since we have to conduct classes keeping social distancing measures in mind, we have to devise ways to do so. The increase in seats after the implementation of the second phase of the EWS quota will make things more difficult. In my opinion, we could have an option for both online and offline classes with relaxation in attendance. Those willing to come to college, while following necessary precautions, should be allowed to do so. Mechanisms for those who cannot do so should be made. For instance, the university could come up with its own platform to conduct online classes.”AdmissionsThe onset of the Covid-19 pandemic has led to the Class 12 board exams conducted by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) being postponed. A delay in the board exams means an immediate impact on the admission process of several universities.Anju Shrivastava, principal of Hindu college, said, “While we are hoping that the UGC put together a timeline considering the CBSE exams, the reality will only unfold in the days to come. If board exams don’t happen in the stipulated time, admissions can be pushed further. We are waiting for the university’s directions on the matter.”An official from the DU’s admission branch said the university had been contemplating this issue. “There are many factors to consider. For instance, with CBSE announcing that it won’t hold exams for languages, the marking is likely to be based on internal assessment, which is done by schools. A mechanism has to be put in place to ensure uniformity across the country. We are working on a tentative schedule and may open the admission portal for entrance-based courses towards mid-May. ”A senior university official from Jamia said the varsity already has a mechanism in place to allow provisional admission for students who do not get have their mark sheets at the time of admission. “The same is likely to be implemented for this period since our admissions are entrance-test based. Students can submit their mark sheets when they get them,” the official said.The JNU VC said the varsity will follow the UGC calendar for the admission process. The National Testing Agency, which conducts the JNU Entrance Exam (JNUEE), on Thursday extended the date of registration till May 15. Last year, the JNU Entrance Exam was held between May 27 and May 30, and the results were declared in the second week of June. “This year we are expected to hold the entrance exam in July so that the admission process can be completed by August as recommended by the UGC,” a JNU official said.Students’ Union Elections The students’ union election is an integral part of both JNU and DU. The elections are conducted in September every year. Last year, while JNU Students’ Union (JNUSU) elections were held on September 7, Delhi University Students’ Union (DUSU) polls were held on September 13. However, uncertainty looms over the students’ body elections this year due to the change in the academic calendar.DS Rawat, former Delhi University chief election officer, said that as per the Lyngdoh Committee Guidelines, the students’ union election shall be conducted six to eight weeks after the commencement of the academic session. “Normally the academic session begins in July and we conduct elections in September. But now when the academic session is set to begin in August for second and third-year students and in September for first-year students, the elections cannot be held before November,” he said.Officials in the JNU also cited the Lyngdoh Committee Recommendations and said that any decision about the students’ union election will be taken after consulting with the MHRD and the UGC. “The elections lead to huge gatherings. We do not know what the situation will be post-lockdown. Anything related to elections will only be decided after the beginning of the academic session,” a senior official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/universities-deliberate-on-implementing-ugc-s-exam-recommendations/story-OuObs5SN52Q7zaTwOUmsaN.html

It was their duty to implement the Central government’s guidelines. Their samplings and testing should have been done there. Had they told us it was not being done, we would have sent teams for the same,” Singh told ANI here.As many as 76 people, who had returned from Takhat Sachkhand Sri Hazur Abchal Nagar Sahib in Maharashtra’s Nanded, have tested positive for Covid-19. Around 300 Nanded returnees have been tested so far.Singh said that the teams would have been able to test the pilgrims and segregate them on the basis of the results to prevent further spread.“We would have brought them here in separate buses and kept the people who tested positive in isolation and the others in quarantine. We are now testing all the pilgrims. We will be able to control this situation within a few days,” Singh said.“We have not allowed anyone to go home. Those who came to Tarn Taran directly had come after crossing five to six states. They were not stopped on any border. After they entered Punjab, our government traced them,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-alleges-maha-govt-s-negligence-after-several-nanded-returnees-test-positive/story-aoLCobkV8J8lLkHYI60muJ.html

01-05-2020||Chandigarh||Kotkhai custodial death case: CBI court dismisses IGP Zaidi’s bail plea||The special court of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Friday dismissed the bail application of suspended inspector general of police (IGP) Zahur Haider Zaidi, an accused in the Kotkhai custodial death case.The case was heard via video conferencing where Zaidi appeared from inside Burial Jail.He had sought interim bail for 60 days citing medical reasons. He had also he might be at the risk of getting the infection inside the overcrowded jail where he has been lodged and stated that as per the Supreme Court orders to decongest jails in the wake of Covid-19, he should be granted interim bail.In April, Zaidi had pleaded he was suffering from hypertension and not keeping well otherwise, too. In view of the Covid-19, he had pleaded for bail saying he was susceptible to the infection.The Burail Jail superintendent filed the application via email to the district and sessions judge Paramjeet Singh. After a few days, Zaidi also filed the application in the Punjab and Haryana high court mentioning that he had filed an application in district court.Following this, the sessions judge marked the mail (application) to the CBI judge on April 28, and a notice was issued on the same day.On Friday, the HC adjourned the case till May 4, “allowing the district court to take the decision.” The arguments took place in the district court wherein public prosecutor KP Singh opposed the bail application.KP Singh argued: “The accused (Zaidi) has given different grounds of bail in the two applications. In the HC, he has given medical ground and in the CBI court, he has given an account of government’s order regarding de-congestion of jail in the wake of corona pandemic.”Opposing the application on the de-congestion of jail, Singh said that “the government’s order does not imply in cases involving charges under Section 302.” Opposing the medical ground, Singh argued “he has attached a medical certificate of 2017. There is no recent certificate, which shows any medical urgency.”After hearing the arguments, special CBI judge Sushil Kumar Garg dismissed the bail application moved by Zaidi.The custodial killing case is an offshoot of the rape and murder case of a 16-year-old school-girl in Kotkhai area of Shimla district. Six men were initially arrested by Himachal police in the case, and one of them was later found dead at the Kotkhai police station.5 accused move interim bail applicationsCiting Covid-19 pandemic, five accused in Kotkhai custodial death case, who are lodged in Model Jail, Chandigarh have moved bail applications in the district court.

01-05-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh records zero road fatality in a month for first time in decade||The curfew set up in the city due to the Covid-19 outbreak has presented a silver lining. As per the data released by the UT traffic police, the month of April this year was the first month in at least a decade without a single fatal road accident reported.The total number of road fatalities in the year 2019 was 98. The number of fatalities till April 2019 was 23, which have come down to 13 this year for the same period. The April of 2019 itself had reported four fatal accidents.Till 2010, there wasn’t a single month without a fatal accident being reported in the city. No data was available for the last time when there were zero accidents in a month in the city.CHALLENGE WILL START AFTER LOCKDOWNDeputy inspector general of police (DIG, Traffic) Shashank Anand said the result wasn’t much cause for celebration and was along expected lines. “Due to the curfew there has hardly been any traffic on the roads and a large number of nakas have been set up. So fatal accidents were bound to come down,” he said, adding that the challenge will start when normal resumes.He added that the traffic police will push people to adopt cycling as a means of transportation after the restrictions were lifted: “Cycling will help maintain social distancing while reducing pollution and road fatalities. Even the World Health Organisation has recommended that people cycle to move around whilst Covid-19 is active.”Deputy superintendent of police (DSP, Traffic East) Charanjit Singh Virk added that the same sensibility used to tackle Covid-19 should also be used towards road accidents as they also cause a huge loss of lives daily in India.‘USE POST-LOCKDOWN PERIOD TO ENCOURAGE CYCLING, USE OF PUBLIC TRANSPORT’Road safety activist Harpreet Singh said the authorities should use this time to push people towards other modes of transport. “An odd-even format for vehicles can be started in the city after the lockdown, so that people can adopt public transport or cycling. We are being presented with a second chance to keep traffic congestion and pollution in the city from reaching the previous dangerous levels,” he said. A member of the UT Road Safety Council, Harman Sidhu, said after the curfew is lifted, a spike in accident cases may follow. “A large number of people are likely to come out on the streets and the authorities will have to be on their toes to prevent accidents. People should continue to ditch their cars and walk to their neighborhood grocery stores the way Le Corbusier intended,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-records-zero-road-fatality-in-a-month-for-first-time-in-decade/story-M3c1eC9P2PeS1ej5xNGbdL.html

The driver deputed at Sundar Nagar fire station had come in contact with an electrician of Amarpura area, which had reported positive cases in the past. Another fire fighter deployed at Gill road fire station was quarantined after a positive case was reported from his village. Assistant divisional fire officer (ADFO) Bhupinder Singh said both were advised to self-quarantine for 15 days after their circumstances were known. None of them had shown any symptom during screening, however, they were asked to quarantine themselves as a precautionary measure, he said.Fire station officer (FSO) Shritsi Nath Sharma said, “Before re-inducting them into the service, we want their samples be sent for testing as a precautionary step. We perform emergency services and fire fighters meet a large number of people when they move to douse a fire or sanitise streets. The objective is to ensure that they are not carrying the virus.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-fire-brigade-seeks-testing-of-two-fire-fighters-before-re-inducting-them-into-service/story-IjZGztNIW0mmOz4gWZieJN.html

Commissioner secretary, industries and commerce department, MK Dwivedi said, “We have been able to revive 55% to 60% industrial sector in J&K. However, there are some hurdles. Several units, which are being allowed to function, have their sale outlets in municipal limits that do not have the permission to open.”“For instance, if textile mills manufacture products where will their supplies go. There are manufacturers, who do business via wholesalers. These wholesalers are also in municipal limits,” he said.Dwivedi said movement passes for people working in these industries is another problem.“The district administrations have to give permissions but they are occupied in Covid mitigation efforts. In some cases, the permissions are getting delayed and as a result these units, which had to open on Friday, will now take three to four more days to start functioning,” he said.The UT has industrial estates in Pulwama, Srinagar, Budgam, Udhampur, Kathua, Jammu and Samba districts.“Also, the workforce is not readily available now and many of them want to go back to their native places,” he said.“We expect more relaxations in green zones post May 3. As of now, shops selling essential items in standalone zones are allowed. However, those selling non-essential items are not allowed to open. They can be regulated on alternate days but it will be the Centre’s call,” he said.“Shops selling non-essentials should be allowed to open in green zones on alternate days. It will create a demand and help the manufacturing sector,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/j-k-admn-working-to-remove-bottlenecks-for-hassle-free-production-supply/story-WmLMNbgcxFpr7QnpiOWgtM.html
01-05-2020||Chandigarh||With extension in lockdown, students in dilemma over competitive exam dates||The city students who have been preparing for the competitive exams and had to appear for the Joint Entrance Examination (Mains and Advanced) and National Eligibility-cum-Entrance test (NEET), are in dilemma after the extension of lockdown till May 17.With uncertainty in exam dates, the engineering and medical aspirants are worried and concerned about how to take forward their preparation for the entrance exams that were scheduled to be held this year.Earlier due to Covid-19 pandemic, the JEE (Mains) exam that was scheduled to be held on April 5 was postponed. While, the JEE (Advanced) exam that was scheduled for May 17 has also been postponed and will be rescheduled after the JEE (Mains) exam. Also, the NEET exam for medical aspirants that was scheduled to be held on May 3 has also been postponed. “I am preparing for this JEE (Advanced) exam after I appeared for JEE (Mains) in January this year. I scored 99.89 percentile in JEE mains. I feel dejected as the JEE (Advanced) exam that was scheduled for May 17 has been postponed. Now, with not many options left, I am attempting the online test series and revising through reference books,” said Mukul Gupta, a non-medical student who has been taking coaching from a private institute.Meanwhile, there are some students who have also taken this lockdown positively. They say it’s an extended opportunity to prepare more thoroughly for exams. “As the exams have been postponed, I have got more time to revise and clear the concepts. The syllabus is vast, and I got the opportunity to attempt more test series and work on my weak areas,” 18-year-old medical aspirant Simridhi Manchanda said.“I am a little worried, but I know that I need to focus on revision than wasting time in thinking of the exam dates. I study 11 hours-a-day and take frequent breaks to relax as well,” a Class 12 student of BCM Arya Model Senior Secondary School said.‘Students should keep the momentum going’“Students need to stop worrying about the exam dates and keep the momentum going. We have advised students, who had completed the entire syllabus, to attempt regular tests and revise their notes time to time. They can participate in online test series. While those students, whose preparation was incomplete, have been advised to focus on chapter wise preparation and attempt part tests. They can attend crash courses, which cover chapter wise important topics. Later, they can take to full syllabus tests,” said Tejpreet Singh, co-founder and COO, Edusquare, a private coaching institute. Students should not panic and waste time thinking about stuff that’s not in their control, he added.Meanwhile, he also suggested that the National Testing Agency should cancel JEE (Advanced) altogether and use JEE (Mains) merit list for admissions to IITs also. This would save about 40 days in the admission cycle, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/with-extension-in-lockdown-students-in-dilemma-over-competitive-exam-dates/story-OUV7VQ8by5krcrVRkxTtbM.html

Toilets are all dirty and being used by both infected patients and others,” said the agitated kin.The inmates expressed their support for the protest by raising their hands from the windows of the ward. The students were shouting from inside asking their parents to take them home. The parents of the Kota-returnees, who have tested negative, demanded that they should be discharged and sent home.Witnessing commotion, Division No 7 police reached the spot and began pacifying the agitated relatives and quarantine inmates.Shimlapuri resident Parmod Kumar said his son Kishore had returned from Kota on April 27. “The very next day, the health department brought him to the hospital on the pretext of collecting his samples. Despite testing negative, he is not being discharged and made to share the washroom with Covid-19 patients,” said Parmod.Parents also alleged that their kids were not getting food on time. “Breakfast is not available in the morning, lunch is provided during evening, while dinner is given around 11pm and sometimes at midnight,” complained one of the parents.Those who live nearby said they often delivered food for their children at the hospital, but the same did not reach them at times.Another parent R K Singh told HT that his son Sipur said there was barely any arrangement for food and the toilets were unkempt.Senior medical officer (SMO) Amita Jain said she was incharge of the treatment of Covid-19 patients.When asked about the issue, joint MC commissioner Navraj Singh Brar admitted that they had faced some hiccups initially as nearly 100 inmates were rushed to the hospital. “But now everything has been streamlined. The food is prepared by Kalgidhar Gurdwara and is being served on time. Tea and water is also regularly served those in quarantine. There are a few troublemakers who are inciting others as they want to be shifted to a private facility. We have identified them and they would be shifted to another isolation centre,” said Brar adding that infected patients were being kept separate from others.Meanwhile, Youth Akali Dal district president Gurdeep Singh Gosha also accused the administration of failing to provide facilities to the Nanded-returned pilgrims.He shared several videos of weeping pilgrims, who returned on Thursday, urging the authorities to send them back to Nanded due to the lack of facilities.Recently, many videos were shared on the social media showing inmates arguing with the hospital staff for not providing masks. Pictures of overflowing bins and dirty washrooms at the hospital also made the rounds on the internet.HEAT TAKING TOLL ON DOCTORS’ HEALTHWearing a PPE kit and collecting samples under extreme heat is taking a toll on the Ludhiana civil hospital staff. On Thursday evening, a doctor who was collecting samples of pilgrims while standing in a kiosk at the civil hospital fell unconscious due to dehydration. It was alleged that there was no provision of water in the cubicle due to which the doctor had fainted.AIDS CONTROL WORKERS DEMAND SALARY HIKEDemanding salary hike and permanent jobs, total 750 members of Punjab AIDS Control Employees Welfare Association, who have been working on contract basis, staged a protest against the government on Friday. They said that for the past 20 years, they had been working on contract with meagre salaries. Association president Mahinder Pal said that besides carrying out de-addiction programmes they were also deployed in Covid-19 units.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lack-of-facilities-at-govt-quarantine-facility-triggers-protest-in-ludhiana/story-UBLJPXrbJ8GN70uJMQJKtI.html

Hospitalised after being tested positive for the novel coronavirus (Covid-19) disease, the news of his senior, assistant commissioner of police (ACP, North) Anil Kumar Kohli’s death due to the infection came as a rude shock.Having been attached as a gunman in the ACP’s security detail, Prabhjot had been accompanying him everywhere. “We had been deployed at the vegetable market and used to work there from dawn to dusk until April 8 when ACP Kohli fell ill and had to taken to the hospital. After he tested positive, we were also sent into quarantine,” said Prabhjot Singh.“Handling the crowd at the vegetable market, especially at a time when people were already in panic due to the curfew, was a daunting task. There was a mad rush to hoard supplies and we had to be on our toes 24/7,” he says.“There were huge crowds at the mandi everyday. Our ACP had been attending meetings with several officials, traders, and people everyday. We have no idea from where he contracted the virus,” he says, adding that his senior served the people till the very end and he wants to follow in his footsteps and join duty as soon as possible. Discharged from the Ferozepur civil hospital on Thursday, constable Prabhjot Singh now has to undergo a 14-day home quarantine before he can resume duty.

01-05-2020||City||Lockdown blues: Chandigarh airport loses ₹10 crore in airline fee||Over a month of the nationwide lockdown to prevent the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has caused a loss of ₹10 crore to the Chandigarh international airport. The main revenue of the airport is generated under the aeronautical category, whereby the airport charges ₹800 per passenger from airlines. For instance: An airline flying to Delhi with 80% occupancy pays around ₹65,000 to airport per flight. Factor in the commercial revenue in the form of rent of retail shops, office space rents, car parking and advertisements, and the total revenue under both the categories comes to around ₹30 lakh per day. Before the lockdown, there were around 44 flights from the airport connected to major cities across the country and two international flights to Sharjah and Dubai. The daily footfall, both arrival and departure, was 7,000 passengers. All that has been affected ever since the lockdown began on March 24.LONG ROAD TO RECOVERYAirport chief executive officer (CEO) Ajay Kumar Bhardwaj said, “Due to the lockdown, we have majorly suffered a loss of ₹10 crore in aeronautical revenue till Friday. As far as rents under commercial revenue are concerned, the stakeholders are not in a position to pay now. We will defer it or give them some concession.” Bhardwaj said even after opening of the lockdown, it will take around six months to one year to normalise the operations and that they were expecting only 15-20 flights per day initially.On other hand, despite 24x7 operations becoming a reality from April 10 last year, no new international flight has been added in the summer schedule this year too.Vivek Nijhawan, in-flight caterer at the airport said, “As a vendor, we have invested huge sums in infrastructure and we were upgrading it further as per the demand of airlines. In the past one month we have suffered a loss of ₹50 lakh. We do not know what will happen in the future.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lockdown-blues-chandigarh-airport-loses-10-crore-in-airline-fee/story-EpcU1Bnp0pAMwxr1eOMW4H.html

Thane had 101 cases till April 15, but the numbers tripled in the last 15 days. Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) has completely sealed Lokmanya Nagar and Kopri where the cases are increasing.Sandeep Malvi, deputy municipal commissioner of TMC, said, “Till April 29, the city had 107 containment zones, of which, 18 have completed the containment period. There are 88 active containment zones across the city ---18 are in Lokmanya Nagar, 17 in Naupada-Kopri and 10 in Majiwada-Manpada ward.”The most number of Covid positive cases has been found at Mumbra, Lokmanya Nagar, Wagale Estate and Vartak Nagar.The spike began with several workers of a political party, who were distributing food among labourers, testing positive after a police officer was infected.A police officer requesting anonymity said, “This led to an increase in number of cases in Mumbra and Vartak Nagar areas. Another social worker in CP Talao tested positive and led to a second chain of infection in Wagale Estate slums. A funeral attended by around 70 people at Lokmanya Nagar triggered more Covid positive cases.”The number of containment zones in the city also increased from 20 on April 9 to 88 zones by April 29. Malvi said, “Around 387 people have been traced as high-risk contacts of those found positive so far.”People residing in areas declared as containment zones cannot go out. They will have to order essentials online or through helpline numbers provided by the TMC. The security guards of their building or the police will deliver groceries so that residents do not leave their homes. A 43-year-old resident of Kopri said, “Initially, we had problems getting milk and vegetables after our area was declared a containment zone. Later, we managed to get essentials home delivered through TMC helpline.”The Thane collector has not allowed any emergency or pre-monsoon construction activity in these zones.Out of the 310 positive cases in Thane till Thursday, 110 are women -- which is about 35% of the total cases.

It has been explained that the malicious application during the course of its downloading asks the user to permit the use of the internet and installation of additional application packages, which eventually turn out to be mischievous links like “face.Apk, imo.Apk, normal.Apk, trueC.Apk, snap.Apk and viber.Apk”.After clicking these malicious link, a virus may enter into a user’s mobile phone, help hackers to track and monitor the content and activity on the device. The data in the device is then easily extracted and saved in a remote control server of the mischievous apps.The general public is advised to maintain caution while opening suspicious links over social media platforms and email/VoIP calls on their mobile handset and secure their phone with the latest security patches and anti-virus guard.People are advised to download the Aarogya Setu app only from authentic sources like https://Mygov.in or Apple or Android or IOS play store, he added.Police have advised that if any suspicious activity comes to one’s notice, may kindly be intimated to State Cyber Crime Police Station, Shimla through E-Mail i.e. cybercrcell-hp@nic.in, Cont. No. 0177-2620331.Aarogya Setu application developed by the Government of India helps people assess themselves on the risk of their catching the coronavirus infection.

01-05-2020||Mumbai||‘Encroachers are moving into Aarey during lockdown’||Trees are being cut inside Aarey Milk Colony, Goregaon, during the lockdown period, an environment group told the Supreme Court (SC).On Thursday, city-based NGO Vanshakti, which had approached the court earlier for the protection of the 1,280 hectares Aarey, filed an interim application alleging illegal tree cutting, slum encroachments and fires in the area and peripheral eco-sensitive zone (ESZ). However, no responsive action was taken by state authorities. HT has a copy of the application filed against the Centre and various bodies of the Maharashtra government including the forest department and Aarey administration.“Despite the SC imposing a stay on tree cutting, illegal felling went on through the lockdown period. Repeated pleas to state bodies yielded no results. Faced with prolonged inaction we were forced to inform the court about brazen violations of previous orders,” said Stalin D, director, Vanashakti.The application listed that close to 40 trees were illegally felled at unit 13 in Aarey on April 19. Two incidents of forest fires (on April 17 and 20) were reported from unit 8, close to State Reserve Police Force (SRPF) Camp, which falls within the Aarey ESZ. The amphitheatre situated close to New Zealand Hostel witnessed an increase in illegal slum settlements in areas surrounding both Aarey and Sanjay Gandhi National Park.“Anti-social elements are taking advantage of the lockdown situation. Any further continuation of such unchecked activity will cause irreparable damage to the ecology of Aarey,” read the application.While the Maharashtra forest department said they had no jurisdiction as the area was not a forest - it is mostly under the dairy development department - the Aarey administration confirmed that they had acted on some of the complaints.“We have written to the local police station to file a first-information-report (FIR) against unidentified persons responsible for tree felling at some units. The process is underway,” said Nathu Rathod, chief executive officer, Aarey. “Forest fires were reported from areas that do not fall under our purview. There are no cases of illegal encroachments but local residents had dumped debris on an arterial road between unit 13 and 16. We have cleared the debris and instructed our security staff to keep vigilance in the area,” Rathod said.Meanwhile, the afterword was out about the SC application, a group of 30 people barged into the house of a local teacher on Friday, who is a resident and one of the complainants, said Stalin. “A mob entered the premises of a citizen activist.

01-05-2020||Mumbai||Pay minimum wages to workers unable to report to work due to lockdown: HC||The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court has directed industries employing daily wage earners to continue paying to those workers who are unable to report for work due to the national lockdown, in light of the Covid-19 pandemic. The court has however held that if the workers fail to report for work in areas where lockdown is lifted, the industries will be at liberty to deduct wages.A single bench of justice Ravindra Ghuge while hearing a clutch of petitions challenging a March 23 notification by the ministry of Home Affairs, Union of India wherein section 10 (2) of the Disaster Management Act has been invoked. The section ensures that workers, including the migrants are paid their monthly wages by the employers taking into account the peculiar situation on account of Covid-19. The petitions further pray that though they are willing to offer work and workers are willing to work, due to the lockdown the units are shut or working at reduced pace. Hence the prayer for exemption of paying monthly wages for the period of restriction of manufacturing activities.However, after the union of India and the state informed the court that the Supreme Court was seized of a similar petition and the Kerala high court had stayed an order of the finance department to pay salaries in a deferred manner, the bench said that it was not inclined to interfere.Thereafter, the advocate for the petitioners submitted that the petitioners were willing to pay 50% of the gross wages or the minimum rates of wages prescribed under the Minimum Wages Act, whichever is higher. The court accepted the same and held, “It is clarified that since the State of Maharashtra has partially lifted the lock down recently in certain industrial areas in the State of Maharashtra, the workers would be expected to report for duties as per the shift schedules subject to adequate protection, from Corona Virus infections, by the employer.”The court also allowed managements to deduct wages of workers who voluntarily remained absent by following procedure laid down in Law while initiating such action. This would apply even to areas where there may not have been a lock down. Thus, saying the matter was posted for further hearing on May 18.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/pay-minimum-wages-to-workers-unable-to-report-to-work-due-to-lockdown-hc/story-YVstbRKGQ734LimoWzzWIO.html
01-05-2020||City||‘Social distancing is fundamental to combat Covid-19’||As Jammu and Kashmir continues to witness a surge in the number of Covid-19 cases, prominent pulmonologist Dr Javaid Malik, professor and head of department, chest medicine, SKIMS Medical College Bemina, in an interview with Mir Ehsan says the figures in Kashmir are not rising at an alarming rate and red zones in the UT can be converted into green zones if people follow standard operating procedures (SOP’s) and adopt preventive measures at community-level. Edited excerpts: Are Covid-19 figures in J&K, especially Kashmir, worrying? Considering the high infection rate and significant mortality associated with Covid-19, the figures are worrying. However, the figures in Kashmir, though significant, are not increasing at an alarming rate. The credit goes to people who have followed advisories issued by the authorities.The recovery and death ratio of patients in J&K is better than national average. What is the reason? Currently, our recovery rate may be higher than national average but it is too early to draw firm conclusions from the relatively small sample size that J&K has at present. As the pandemic advances we can get the comparative demographic data and nature of comorbidities from different states so as to derive statistical variables related to mortality difference, if any, between the states. J&K is conducting 1,000 to 1,500 testing daily. Do you think it is sufficient?Looking at the current trend of positive patients in J&K, I think this figure is decent. However, the case detection rate will be better if testing is enhanced. It will help in controlling the pandemic.Kashmir has 7 of the 8 deaths in J&K. Is this worrying and what is the reason? Kashmir region has more number of positive cases and hence more deaths. Also, most patients who have died in the Valley, so far, were above the age of 70 and had multiple comorbidities. What precautions should be taken by people? Social distancing is the fundamental principle of preventive strategy to combat this disease. It is also important that we observe proper coughing and sneezing etiquettes along with hand hygiene. Use of masks, alcohol-based sanitisers and avoiding public gathering are important. What is the status of patients? How are they responding to the treatment? Majority of admitted patients are either asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. They are mostly responding to the treatment. There are very few patients whose oxygen levels are critically low and require ventilator or high pressure oxygen. Any case which made you happy as a frontline worker while treating patients? Yes, there was a young man with severe respiratory failure and low oxygen level in the first week of April. He was discharged three days ago. His issues were compounded by superseded bacterial infection. His recovery was one of the happiest moments for me as a health worker. How can we turn red zone areas into green zones? This can be done by adhering to official advisories, isolation of positive cases and augmentation of contact tracing and testing. Also, preventive measures like social distancing, hand hygiene and coughing and sneezing etiquettes will help.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/social-distancing-is-fundamental-to-combat-covid-19/story-eUyrk5eJtv9hx3jMI0Yc7K.html

We could not analyse the reason behind it but now everything has dried up because pilgrimage remains suspended since March 18 and it’s very depressing to see deserted Katra town, twin tracks and sanctum sanctorum,” he said.The shrine board has around 3,000 employees including 80 priests.“Obviously, there is a cash crunch because we run on donations and have no other source of income,” he added.For the first time in the history of Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Yatra, no pilgrim has visited the holy cave shrine since March 18.During the nine-day long Navratri festival, the shrine had suffered a loss of ₹4.05 crore.Historic Raghunath Temple in the heart of Jammu city continues to wear a deserted look.Mubarak Singh, president of Dharmarth Trust that manages around 130 temples and shrines in Jammu and Kashmir, said, “We are not doing live webcasting but we do post arti and other rituals on Youtube and WhatAspp. The rituals are being performed by the pujaris twice a day.”“From all the temples we used to get around ₹45 lakh every month and our salary bill is over ₹35 lakh. Donations have ceased since the temple was closed down for devotees,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/vaishno-devi-shrine-raghunath-temple-witness-big-dip-in-offerings-amid-lockdown/story-oRsc3uxp3u9MbeSfqFOrnM.html
01-05-2020||Mumbai||Speed up approval of functional RT-PCR machines: HC directs state, ICMR||The Bombay high court on Thursday directed the state government and the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) to ensure that Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) machines are made available for Covid-19 tests at the earliest.Justice Manish Pitale, issued the direction after being informed that some RT-PCR machines in Vidarbha are not being used for Covid-19 tests as they are awaiting ICMR’s approval. The court was hearing a petition filed by Nagpur resident CH Sharma in 2000, raising concerns about the healthcare quality at the four government medical colleges in Vidarbha region.Sharma had complained that the colleges did not have enough medical seats for imparting education to students, lacked proper equipment for treatment and they lacked adequate staff, expert teachers and suffered from a paucity of funds.This year on March 18, he moved the HC again pointing out that the medical colleges were ill-equipped to handle the Covid-19 patients and create isolation facilities.During the course of hearing, the state’s counsel informed the court that at present RT-PCR test is only reliable in case of diagnosis of Covid-19 and rapid antibody test can at best be used for surveillance purposes. Assistant government pleader Dipak Thakare also said that the state has received 71,000 rapid antibody test kits for distribution in hot-spot areas, but the director of health services has issued instructions to all centres not to use the kits, as informed by ICMR. Distribution of the kits has been stopped from April 20.Assistant solicitor general Ulhas Aurangabadkar, however, maintained that the ICMR has not taken any decision to do away with rapid antibody tests and has merely asked not to use kits purchased from two particular Chinese manufacturers. He said the tests could certainly be undertaken for surveillance, although the best test for diagnosis of Covid-19 continues to be the RT-PCR swab test.Justice Pitale then directed the state authorities to make available RT-PCR tests for use and undertake rapid antibody tests for surveillance as suggested by ICMR. “This becomes all the more significant, considering that the results of the rapid antibody tests are said to be quick and hence of assistance to the state government in deciding its strategy to deal with areas where there is rapid spread of Covid-19,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/speed-up-approval-of-functional-rt-pcr-machines-hc-directs-state-icmr/story-qQ4hhWSpkpGrM6YBp23rvM.html

01-05-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana govt school students make the grade with saksham exam||CHANDIGARH: When the learning levels of students from Classes 3 to 8 in Haryana government schools were tested in September under the ‘saksham ghoshna’ examination, the result was unimpressive.Five months on in February, the state government again held the exam. The authorities heaved a sigh of relief. “The result has been a huge success. The assessment of the students’ papers was done by a third party, “ Dr Rakesh Gupta, project director, chief ministers good governance associates (CMGGAs), said.“From next year, we have decided to assess students of Classes 9 and 10 also. English will be another subject of this exam.”TESTING COMPETENCEThe three-year-old ‘saksham’ Haryana programme is an initiative of the education department to assess and then improve the learning levels of government school students. The September exam was conducted on a random basis in 5,500 schools selected from 119 blocks of 22 districts.“In the September exam, no block was declared saksham. But in the February exam, 22 blocks from across 14 districts were assessed as saksham in all 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 grades,” a government spokesperson said.As per official data, just 64,793 students of third to middle standard opted for this exam in February. The largest number of 6,619 students of Hisar district sat in this exam, while Faridabad recorded the lowest attendance with 1,152 students. In Karnal district, 3,215 students were assessed in comparison to 3,975 students of Sirsa. In nine districts each, more than 3,000 students appeared in the exam.The Classes 3 to 5 students were assessed in Hindi, mathematics and environmental science (EVS), while Classes 6 to 8 pupils took the science, mathematics, social studies and Hindi papers across the state’s 119 blocks.SCORING PRACTICEA block gets the tag of ‘saksham’ where more than 80% students score over 50% marks in the ghoshna exam. Another level is ‘near saksham’ where more than 60% students have to score over 50% marks, while a block is ‘not saksham’ if less than 60% students score over 50% marks.Dr Gupta said 93 blocks were declared saksham in Class 5, while in Classes 6 and 8 almost half of the blocks were saksham with 64 and 65 blocks, respectively, achieving this benchmark. At least 40 blocks made it to saksham in grade 7.A block is disqualified where data analysis indicates mass cheating.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/haryana-govt-school-students-make-the-grade-with-saksham-exam/story-Ixhjq0vg90mbp80Eyu2BGL.html

01-05-2020||Pune||On the frontline: Virus will be controlled when there is 60-70 % herd immunity, says Dr Choudhari||Health workers are on the front lines fighting against the Covid-19 pandemic. Dr Prashant Choudhari, (45) who is a practising radiologist and also a managing committee member, Indian Medical Association; secretary, Pune Radiologist Association, and general secretary, National Medicos Organisation, Maharashtra speaks to HT about the on ground work that he has been doing since the lockdown began.What exactly is your role in this crisis?Ever since the lockdown began, I along with a few of my doctor friends were instrumental to collate and collect information of all the private doctors who would give free consultation within the set timings across Pune. This was during the first week of the lockdown. I have never shut my OPD during the lockdown. In fact, after finishing the stipulated hours in the OPD, I join a team of doctors to visit hotspot areas in Pune for assistance. We go door-to-door and conduct preliminary checks and treat those with minor covid symptoms I was first sent to Parvati vasti where I checked 200 patients and found four suspected cases. As a doctor, we were initially told that the vasti people might not like us prodding them, but once we began our rounds, they were more than cooperative. Creating awareness among them was also our job as they were afraid of the stigma. We were a team of two doctors, four local volunteers and a PMC official. There is always an ambulance on standby to take the suspected cases to Naidu hospital. Currently, I have been given Mangalwar peth, where I have screened 170 people.How does your day begin and rolls out?I wake up early and begin by helping my wife in the kitchen, washing the utensils, preparing for the breakfast, as my wife is also a doctor. We have two children and my parents al so stay with us. So before I set out for my OPD, I ensure that the entire family has had a health breakfast by 9.30 am.We have divided the house work among everyone and we pitch to help in any ways we can. Then post my OPD, after 3 pm, I head into the field, checking patients until 7pm.What precautions are you taking?In the OPD I use mask, sanitiser and a gown with head cap and a face shield. On field, I wear a PPE which is compulsory along with gloves and masks.What is your assessment of the Covid-19 crisis n Pune? How is it unfolding?Covid-19 is not going to go away. There are going to be end number of cases undiagnosed, for 50 per cent of patients who might have Covid-19 are healthy carriers and the number will increase. When there is 60-70 per cent of herd immunity within the community, only then will this virus be controlled. PMC has its limitations, and though they are trying their best, we have a huge population, and it will need not just doctors, but everyone to participate.What gaps do you see in health and relief work?All hospitals are doing an amazing job. But the gaps are from the citizens. Patients hide facts regarding symptoms and travel history, which makes them careless. I appeal all residents to share all details.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/on-the-frontline-virus-will-be-controlled-when-there-is-60-70-herd-immunity-says-dr-choudhari/story-Wc0VEUpvYrHucWCov1DxyO.html

01-05-2020||Pune||As Pune slums emerge as Covid-19 hotspots, political activists urge for tweak in strategy||Pune Municipal Corporation authorities have said that notwithstanding the poor response from slum dwellers to shifting to the nearly 70 temporary shelters created in civic schools, numerous steps have been taken to contain the spread of Covid-19 in the city’s slums.However, political activists from the affected slum areas said the PMC needs to change its approach in slums given the high population density, tiny houses and enormous difficulty in maintaining social distancing.Nearly seven weeks after the first case in Maharashtra was reported in Pune on March 9, eight slums in Pune from five wards, namely Bhavani Peth, Kasba-Vishrambaug, Dhole Patil Road, Yerawada-Kalas-Dhanori and Shivajingar have emerged as the major hot spots of the disease in Pune.As of April 29, 81 people have died of this disease in Pune—one of the highest death tolls in the country—and more than 1,400 have tested positive.Former deputy mayor of Pune, Dr Siddharth Dhende, a doctor with a regular practice in the Nagpur Chawl and Yerawada slum said, “PMC needs to change its approach and needs to provide basic food kits with the help of self-help groups instead of allowing slum dwellers to go to fair price shops. The PMC needs to take care of community toilets. These people also need a source of income.”Congress leader Avinash Bagwe said, “People in the slums are not observing social distance in their interactions. The civic body should provide them with two weeks’ food supply and enforce the lockdown strictly in the slum areas. The idea of creating shelter homes has flopped and a practical solution would be to provide food and vegetables at their doorsteps.”As reported on Wednesday, Bagwe had said that people were not ready to move to the shelter homes for various reasons such as no food facility and the fear of things getting stolen from their small tenements. They were also worried that may not be allowed to go home for errands by the police if they moved to the temporary shelters.Pune municipal commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad and additional municipal commissioner Rubal Agarwal said a number of steps were being taken by the civic body to control the spread of Covid-19 in the slums. These included rigorous contact tracing with an emphasis on High Risk and Low risk contacts; stepping up swab testing; opening of dedicated Covid Care booth in hotspot areas; allocation of 10 mobile clinics/ambulances per ward and deployment of 75 teams per ward for the 5 hotspot wards.Also, patients who had tested negative were being discharged with a packet of five masks, sanitiser and soap and comprehensive medical, nutritional and psycho-social care was being provided for those with Covid-19.Agarwal said the civic body was doing extensive sanitisation in the affected areas regularly and had increased the civic water supply in these areas for proper hygiene and sanitation.She said that schools had been opened in these areas to enable slum dwellers to use them as night shelters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/as-pune-slums-emerge-as-covid-19-hotspots-political-activists-urge-for-tweak-in-strategy/story-Ococb6oj76xY5DnS1McxOI.html
01-05-2020||Chandigarh||#MainViManjeetSingh: AAP’s Punjab unit starts campaign, seeks Rs 50 lakh compensation for departed PRTC driver||The Punjab wing of the Aam Aadmi Party initiated the #MainViManjeetSingh (I am Manjeet Singh too) campaign on Friday, seeking Rs 50 lakh compensation for the family of Pepsu Road Transport Corporation (PRTC) driver Manjeet Singh who died on his way to Hazur Sahib, Nanded, Maharashtra on April 26.The Punjab government had sanctioned a compensation of Rs 10 lakh for Manjeet’s family.AAP’s Punjab chief and Sangrur MP Bhagwant Mann staged the protest at his residence in Sangrur, leader of opposition and Dirba MLA Harpal Singh Cheema also followed suit. AAP MLAs and party leaders held protests in their respective residences and held placards demanding ‘justice’ for the ‘corona warrior’.“Manjeet Singh was on special duty. There should be no discrimination between a cop Harjit Singh, whose hand was chopped off, and Manjeet Singh who died while on duty. The government should award Rs 50 lakh to his family because he was a frontline warrior against the Covid-19 pandemic,” said Mann.The 38-year-old driver, who hailed from Badbar village of Barnala district, suffered a heart attack while the bus was going to fetch stranded Sikh pilgrims to Punjab from Hazur Sahib amid the nationwide lockdown.Leader of opposition Harpal Cheema said their party had demanded adequate compensation for the victim’s family because the role of people like Manjeet Singh was also commendable during tough times.“Manjeet sacrificed his life fighting against coronavirus. We are staging protests across the state seeking justice for Manjeet. The government just announced Rs10 lakh but we demand that his family should be given Rs 50 lakh and his kin should be given a government job,” said Cheema.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/mainvimanjeetsingh-aap-s-punjab-unit-starts-campaign-seeks-rs-50-lakh-compensation-for-departed-prtc-driver/story-GschtrgGvHO8EVpZMLAcXM.html
01-05-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: Home is where his heart is||Home is a place where the heart feels easy — at least this is how the self-proclaimed “mast maula (carefree soul)” Ashok Kumar Dhaka feels.“And the best way to keep the heart calm is to try to remain contended,” he says, adding, “no point in worrying about what might happen tomorrow.”An electrical engineer in a Gurugram residential society, Mr Dhaka, 36, is chatting on WhatsApp — the picture is taken through the phone screen that connects him to this reporter. He says he is never perturbed by external events, and is not particularly rankled even by the ongoing pandemic. “I take all the precautions I can”—he is wearing a white mask—“but I don’t fret about things upon which I have no control.”Unlike many of us, Mr Dhaka’s working life hasn’t been profoundly altered. Indeed, he is temporarily staying in the apartment complex—his workplace—due to the lockdown. Otherwise he lives alone in a one-room house in Jharsa village in Sector 39, which he doesn’t consider a home. It doesn’t have his family (they’re in the village). There’s no TV. The only potential source of distraction in the room is the window through which he might look out into the neighbourhood “but I keep it covered with a curtain,” he says, laughing. Instead, the gentleman considers his workspace his “ghar,” home. He is a workaholic, and it was true even in the BC (Before Corona) era. He would always try to opt for early morning shifts, and though his duty would end by 2pm, he wouldn’t leave straight for Jharsa village. “I’d mostly continue to work until it would be really dark... there’s nothing to do in the room after all.” And then he would cover the 20-minute distance walking, his hands sometimes tucked into his pants pockets, and his black pitthu bag (backpack) hanging on his back.So now he must be thrilled having to live on his “work site” 24/7, thanks to the lockdown.Mr Dhaka looks amused. Following a pause, as if thinking hard to translate his feeling into words, he says, “to me, naukri is home.”What about the village then?His family, including wife and kids, live in Jhunjhunu, Rajasthan.“I frequently visit them—they’re only 4 hours away by bus.”In fact, he was in the village a few days before the lockdown started. “By then, I had already heard of coronavirus... there were news of people dying in China.” Nobody in the village was talking of the virus, though. “My village is far removed from the tensions of cities.” Mr Dhaka wistfully talks of its temples, its by-lanes, the friends he left there, and the taalaab (rainwater lake) whose cool water is a refuge to the cattle. “Life there is as mast as me.” To be honest, Mr Dhaka sometimes wonders just why he left the village, especially “when the high cost of living in Gurgaon nullifies whatever difference in the earnings one enjoys in a city compared to a village.”But he doesn’t stress much. “I enjoy my present.” He opens a picture in his mobile that depicts “the biggest part of my present”—a portrait of his wife, Sunita, and children, Mohit and Lakshita.As soon as the lockdown ends, Mr Dhaka will wait for 10 days “for things to normalise” and then he will board a bus for a holiday in the village—“my true home.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-home-is-where-his-heart-is/story-Kt99Ssb8XEB6fdFvF5KkTK.html
01-05-2020||Chandigarh||Two missing mentally disabled persons found in Amritsar, MP, reunited with families||Two missing mentally disabled men found living in deplorable conditions in Amritsar and Madhya Pradesh have at long last been rescued and reunited with their families in Punjab. A Jalandhar-based NGO was instrumental in ensuring their homecoming. National Centre for Promotion of Employment for Disabled People (NCPEDP) and its activist Amarjit Anand stepped in to help the men when they heard of their pitiable condition.In the first case, Lovepreet, 19, a mentally disabled man, had gone missing in Ferozepur five months ago. His mother, Paramjeet Kaur, works as a housemaid in Barike village near Hussainwala, to make ends meet. She is a single mother and has four children. 19-YEAR-OLD’S MOTHER HAD BEEN FEARING THE WORST Kaur says she had filed a missing person complaint with the police but had gradually lost hope when months passed without any news of her son. She was reunited with her son on Friday after he underwent a Covid-19 test upon his return from Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh with the GRP police on Thursday night. Kaur said, “I had sleepless nights wondering how my child was surviving without food and shelter.” Lovepreet, was found sleeping on roads by the GRP police and circulated a video of him to ascertain his identity. Anand, who is also a member of the state advisory board on disabilities, said two weeks ago that he shared the video with all volunteers across the state. Last week, a worker, Pritpal Singh, with help of a local NGO and the administration found him in Jabalpur village. Pritpal, arranged food and lodging for the teen, till the administration ensured his safe departure. “We put forth his case before district magistrate Jabalpur Bharat Yadav and he sanctioned Rs 35, 000 to cover taxi fare and other expenses to send Lovepreet back to his family,” Anand said.In the second case, 21-year-old Javed, who also has mental disabilities, boarded a train on March 31 and reached Amritsar.His father Lukmaan, a 71-year-old rickshaw puller lived in Mayur Vihar, Delhi, launched a manhunt to find him the next day but to no avail.Anand, with help of local volunteers and the Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities (DEPwD), ensured the child’s safe return.Anand said that he had received information about this child from a shopkeeper in Amritsar and through NCPEDP executive director Armaan Ali on March 31. “With the intervention of the NGO and DEPwD, the child was sent back to his home in Delhi on April 4. It took several days for us to trace and retrace the child,” he said.“In this unprecedented situation, the administration and governments have chance to trace most missing children, especially mentally disabled people, who mostly, sleeps on the roads,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/two-missing-mentally-disabled-persons-found-in-delhi-mp-reunited-with-families-in-punjab/story-k5jBZSJDYDCfeJFAQxvrZP.html

01-05-2020||Mumbai||On Maharashtra Day, water resources minister Jayant Patil thanks ‘those bravely battling Covid-19’||Maharashtra is celebrating its 60th Foundation Day on Friday.The state came into existence, along with Gujarat, in 1960 when the Bombay Reorganization Act was passed by India’s Parliament to divide the multilingual state of Bombay into Gujarat and Maharashtra. Extending his wishes on Maharashtra’s Foundation Day, the state’s water resources minister Jayant Rajaram Patil expressed his gratitude to ‘everyone who is bravely battling for us against Covid-19’.Here is the full text of the minister’s statement on Maharashtra Day: Today we celebrate the 60 years of the formation of the State of Maharashtra. I extend my best wishes to every Maharashtrian and my deepest gratitude to everyone who is bravely battling for us against COVID-19. Maharashtra Divas is one emerged in pride and celebration across every Marathi household. Remembering the struggles of our united past and rejoicing the establishment of our shared legacy through language, culture and Statehood. As we step into the 60th year of our glorious State in the midst of these difficult and dark times, it is important to introspect and remember where we have come from, where we are and where are we marching. Maharashtra has always been a soil of social reformists, thinkers, intellectuals and activists. In Medieval India, reform was ushered in the field of devotion through Bhakti Marg and Varkari Sampraday. Saints like Dnyaneshwar, Namdev, Tukaram propagated the philosophy of equality in spirituality. The principles of religious tolerance and women empowerment cemented by the benevolent and visionary warrior Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj laid ground for the progressive mindset which proved to be a basis for several major social reforms in the 18th and 19th century. In the late 19th century, egalitarian reforms in Maharashtra had three distinct veins; Women’s education & empowerment, Mahatma Phule’s anti-caste truth-seeking society and the organizational endeavors initiated by Bharat Ratna Dr.Babasaheb Ambedkar for the education and rights of the underprivileged. Maharashtra was a frontrunner in the Indian War of Independence producing countless freedom fighters, moderates and radicals alike. After independence, the fate of the Maharashtrian people would not be decided so easily, for the path ahead would be full of further struggle, protests and patience. The concept of a separate state for the Marathi speaking people had been established since the idea of Swaraj by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj in the 17th century, however, after independence, it was only in 1956 that the Samyukta Maharashtra Samiti was formed under the aegis of Keshavrao Jedhe in Pune. Prominent activists like Atre, Prabodhankar Thackeray, Senapati Bapat and Shahir Amar Shaikh and many others have invaluable contribution to the State we call home today. It was Shri. Yashwantrao Chavan Saheb, the first Chief Minister of Maharashtra who led us and our newly formed State into the bright future. An ingenious and intuitive leader, Chavan Saheb was more than a political leader, he was voice of the common in the state and a true Statesman! He guided our State to greatness by planning in the fields of agriculture, water resources, small-scale industries and panchayat raj. His values and principles firmly established Maharashtra on progressive and rational lines. Even with the victory of State formation, challenges kept erupting in the way. Among them are the Muslim Satyashodhak Samaj led by Hamid Dalwai, Baba Adhav’s’ Ek Gaav-Ek Panavatha’s movement, the Yuvak Kranti Dal and the Dalit Panther protests. Aggressive language and satyagrahi actions were the hallmarks of these movements. Baba Amte’s Anandvan emerged as a training center for socialist activists. Post-emergency, our State is once again gifted with a 38-year old Chief Minister in Padma Vibhushan Sharadchandraji Pawar, a true visionary as subsequent decades would prove multiple times. Padma Vibhushan Sharadchandraji Pawar’s immense intuition, insight and intelligence saw the State excel rapidly in agriculture and industries. He reiterated the State under values of welfare, promoting social equality and equity. Post emergency, a lull was evident in youth movements in Maharashtra and in the following decade the women’s liberation movement gained momentum. Maharashtra had been the pioneer in championing the cause of women’s education and emancipation. Journals like ‘Baija’ and ‘Stree’ became the mouthpieces of women’s liberation in the 1980s. Various women and public organizations were formed and took the cause forward. These organizations met various demands of women’s health, hygiene, livelihood, protection, including those of abandoned and verbally divorced women. From this to women’s toilets, many questions were raised by these organizations. This led to the enactment of new laws to protect women against domestic violence, female foeticide, and sexual harassment in the workplace. Maharashtra was the first state in India to enact 30% reservation for women in local bodies under the leadership of Shri Sharad Pawar, and with his untiring efforts over the years it is now 50%. Many would say that in the last decade the legacy of social change within Maharashtra has slowed down. It is true that in the last 10 years, many movements for social equality and social progress have reached a dormant stage in this progressive state that has been instrumental in creating leadership to the country in various fields. We have excelled in various domains of social justice, education, health, local governance, infrastructure and economic development over the last 60 years, and even still a greater course is yet to be covered. Any kind of social numbness which seems to be pervasive should be shunned since our beloved State is in an uphill battle in many fronts, especially today. We face two great threats which cannot be seen. On one hand, an attack on our heath and livelihood by COVID-19 and on the other, an attack on our personal freedom by the pangs of communalism. A defining characteristic of Maharashtra has been that of secularism. Practiced and propagated by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj’s secularism found its roots in Maharashtrian society early, and has inspired the formation and flow of our present society. We have been a people of various faiths who have survived together to live freely together. Against the several ugly communal onslaughts taking place in the country, Maharashtra was the first State to break age-old political barriers, to unite to defend the age-old Maharashtrian spirit of secularism. The Maha Vikaas Aghadi has been a role model for every secular force around the world. Under the very capable administration of Shri Uddhav Thackeray, we as the Maharashtrians have the opportunity to carry on the progressive principles of Maharashtra. It is in our history to struggle and emerge victorious. Today as we fight, as the worst hit state in India, in the war against COVID 19, we must keep hope. Maharashtra has been plagued by many natural and unnatural disaster through time and we have survived. The Government is working every minute and every hour only for the protection and welfare of the people, but it is the people whose mental strength is the most vital at this hour. As we step into 60 years of our existence, let us remind ourselves that it is no one leader who has taken us to where we stand proud today. It is the collective fight and efforts of many great leaders and generations of Maharashtrians who have overcome every hurdle thrown our way. It is in the DNA of every Maharashtrian to challenge, to struggle and to overcome; To be united in the face of danger and achieve victory against all odds. From this war, we will rise again, like the phoenix from the ashes to take flight in the highest skies. I leave you with some lines from our beloved poet Govindagraj, hoping it brings you strength and hope in our fight together. “Mangal desha, pavitra desha, Maharashtra deshaPranam ghyava majha ha shrimaharashtra deshaRakat desha, kankhar desha, dagadanchya deshaNazuk desha, komal desha, fulanchyahi desha”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/on-maharashtra-day-water-resources-minister-jayant-patil-thanks-those-bravely-battling-covid-19/story-CGhXBLTtIjy0FZKJNSMZzO.html

01-05-2020||Lucknow||Leopard spotted on Lucknow outskirts||After flamingos in Mumbai, ‘nilgai’ in Noida, dolphins in Meerut, it is now a leopard that has been spotted in Noorpur village in Gosainganj, on the outskirts of Lucknow.The leopard was spotted by villagers, late on Thursday night after which the police was informed. The villagers blocked the opening of a tunnel pipe in which the big cat had taken refuge.A local resident, Mohit Kumar, who had first spotted the leopard near the culvert said, “I ran for my life and informed the villagers and then the police. The leopard had also been spotted a few days ago in Sarojini Nagar area.”The forest officials, who were called in, tried to get the leopard out of his hiding but failed.Assistant commissioner of police, Mohanlalganj, Sanjeev Sinha said a huge number of villagers had gathered around the culvert and we had a tough time trying to cordon off the area. The forest team has put a net on the end of the culvert so that whenever the feline comes out, it gets trapped in.Zoo director R K Singh said, “The leopard is stuck deep inside the culvert and will take time to come out only when he sees that people are not around.”Singh said that the wild animals were straying into the urban areas mainly due to the lockdown and would move back into the forest areas once the lockdown was lifted and traffic was restored on the roads.Meanwhile, in Bareilly district too, a leopard was spotted in Karimganj village two days ago. When a farmer saw the leopard, the big cat slipped back into the forest area.Later, forest department staff confirmed the presence of the leopard on the basis of its pugmarks.Similarly, pugmarks of a leopard were found at two different areas in Badaun. Chief conservator of forests, Rohilkhand zone, Lalit Verma said, “Apart from leopards and tigers, there have been numerous sightings of hyenas, jackals, deer, jungle cats and crocodiles in human settlements in the last one month. We have rescued many wild animals since the lockdown.”He further said, “Due to the lockdown, there is hardly any movement on roads and animals are moving around freely.”--IANSamita/sdr/||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/leopard-spotted-on-lucknow-outskirts/story-kCDc3ZP7w8elJG9UkQsVxJ.html

To facilitate teaching for fresh classes, the BEPC has booked a 3-hour slot, from 9 am to 12 pm.BEPC programme officer, Kiran Kumari, said the objective of virtual classes was to cover the syllabus of April and May for the students and engage them in academic activities during the lockdown.“For now, we have booked slots for one month. The classes may be further extended depending upon the lockdown situation”, she added.Nipurnh Gupta, communication officer of UNICEF Bihar, said they extended technical support in converting study materials of different classes in digital format. Gupta said, “Analyzing the target audience, television is a better medium for digital classes than mobile in the state. Majority of the students, especially in high school, may not have access to smartphones or parents could not afford additional cost of internet recharge.”“Those students who have access to smartphones, Unnayan App will be complementary in their online learning as it gives a platform to students to discuss queries and solve doubts with subject experts.”As per BEPC officials, there are around 75 lakh students enrolled in classes six to 12 in government and government-aided schools across the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/doordarshan-to-extend-e-learning-to-5-more-standards-from-may-4/story-oBhTMDwN4nPKS0ACfgj0XK.html
01-05-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab’s Jalandhar, Patiala and Ludhiana are among 130 red zone districts in country||Jalandhar, Patiala and Ludhiana in Punjab are among the 130 districts declared as red zones by the Union ministry of health and family welfare (MOHFW).The three of the 22 districts in Punjab were listed among the red zones on Thursday, a day the state saw its sharpest spike in coronavirus positive cases. The Centre, according to a letter sent by secretary, MOHFW, Preeti Sudan, declared 284 districts as orange zones and another 319 as green zones in the country. Ropar, Fatehgarh Sahib, Bathinda and Fazilka in Punjab have been declared green zones and the remaining 15 are orange zones.In the previous list of hotspots, released on April 15, the four districts of Mohali, Jalandhar, Pathankot and Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar were identified as red zones with large outbreaks. “The districts were earlier designated as hotspots/red zones, orange zones and green zones primarily based on cumulative cases reported and the doubling rate. Since recovery rates have gone up, the districts are now being designated across various zones duly broad-basing the criteria. This classification is multi-factoral and takes into consideration incidence of cases, doubling rate, extent of testing and surveillance, feedback to classify the districts,” Sudan wrote to chief secretaries of all states after a meeting held by the Union cabinet secretary with them. The districts have been being considered under green zones if there are no confirmed cases so far or there is no reported case in the past 21 days in the district. The MOHFW secretary said that based on feedback and additional analysis at state level, states may designate additional red or orange zones as appropriate. “However, states may not relax the zonal classification of districts classified as red/orange as communicated by the ministry,” she wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-s-jalandhar-patiala-and-ludhiana-are-among-130-red-zone-districts-in-country/story-aXYA5sf3RNXvI37LSTpztJ.html
01-05-2020||Education||Calcutta University makes its archive with century-old records available online||The Calcutta University on Thursday made its archive, including rare records dating back to the 19th century, available online for the public.Vice-chancellor Sonali Chakraborty Bandyopadhyay told PTI that the archive can be accessed by anyone through the Calcutta University’s official website.There are two major reasons behind the decision, she said.“The first is our responsibility to the students and faculty, whose education and research are getting hampered as they cannot physically access the library collections due to the restrictions.“The second is our responsibility as a public institution to the citizens as well as the world at large.Necessity and value of academic research should be felt by the society,” she said.The university’s library resources, including the digital collections, were accessible so far to users within the campuses.“As a public university, we feel that it is our responsibility to make CU’s digital collections part of the global academic commons, to facilitate the pursuit of knowledge beyond borders,” the vice-chancellor said.The list of digital resources include convocation addresses (1861-2018), Tagore Law Lectures (1870-1986), University Commission reports (1917-1919), minutes of the senate, provisional committee, syndicate & and council (1857- 1988), The Calcutta Review (1844-1966).Besides, the university’s old question papers (1891- 1980), old syllabi (1955-1977), full text of theses (PhD/DLitt/DSc) (1960-2018) and medical dissertations (1956- 2005) have also been made available.The vice-chancellor said teachers of the university have initiated online teaching as regular classes are suspended due to the lockdown and they have also been regularly uploading study materials on the website.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/calcutta-university-makes-its-archive-with-century-old-records-available-online/story-oAZaw91EqbktcI29ejBMAN.html
01-05-2020||Chandigarh||Hotspots in Haryana, Punjab, HP and J&K down to 10, many districts in orange zone now||The number of hotspots or red zones from the four northern states of Haryana, Punjab, Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh; and the union territories of Chandigarh and Ladakh were reduced to 10 from 29 on Thursday night by the Union ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW). The new classification of districts, as per the Union health ministry, is multi-factorial and takes into consideration the incidence of cases, doubling rate, extent of testing and surveillance feedback. A number of existing hotspot districts, consequently, have been dropped into the orange zones and may make it to the green zone subsequently, officials said. “It is important to ensure that we identify pockets of critical interventions for a focused management of Covid-19 at the field level,’’ said Union health secretary Preeti Sudan in an April 30 communication to the chief secretaries of the states. The fresh list of hotspots came after cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba held a video conference with chief secretaries of the states on Thursday.Himachal, Ladakh have no hotspot nowHaryana’s Sonepat and Faridabad districts are now designated as hotspots or red zones in terms of Covid-19 spread. The state earlier had six hotspot districts in Nuh, Gurgaon, Faridabad, Palwal (hotspots with large outbreaks) and Ambala and Karnal (hotspots with clusters), as per the MoHFW classification of April 15.Similarly, Punjab now has only three hotspot districts: Jalandhar, Patiala and Ludhiana as compared to the eight earlier, namely Mohali, Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar, Jalandhar, Pathankot (hotspots with large outbreaks) and Amritsar, Mansa, Ludhiana and Moga (hotspots with clusters).Jammu and Kashmir now has four hotspots, namely Bandipora, Shopian, Anantnag and Srinagar as compared to the eight earlier – Srinagar, Bandipora, Baramulla, Jammu, Udhampur, Kupwara (hotspots with large outbreaks) and Shopian and Rajouri (hotspots with clusters).No districts of Himachal Pradesh (HP) and Ladakh have been categorised as hotspots. HP earlier had five hotspots with clusters in Solan, Una, Kangra, Chamba and Sirmaur, while Ladakh had Kargil. The Union Territory of Chandigarh, which was declared a hotspot on April 15, continues to remain so.Classification criteria broad-basedBroad-basing its criteria for labelling districts as red, orange and green zones, the Union health ministry on Thursday night categorised 18 Haryana districts into orange zones, and the remaining two in green zones. The existing hotspot districts of Nuh, Gurugram and Palwal have made it to the orange zone.The Union health secretary said that districts were earlier designated as hotspots or red zones, orange zones and green zones primarily based on the cumulative cases reported and the doubling rate. “Since the recovery rates have gone up, the districts are now being designated across various zones by broad-basing the criteria,’’ Sudan wrote.A district will be considered under green zone if there are no confirmed cases so far or there is no reported case for the past 21 days, Sudan said.“Some states have raised issues on the inclusion of certain districts in the red zone. I would like to highlight that this is a dynamic list. The list will be revised on a weekly basis or earlier and communicated to states for further follow-up action in consonance with the directions issued by Union home ministry under the Disaster Management Act,’’ the Union health secretary said.States at liberty to classify red zonesThe Central government though has also given the liberty to the state government to designate additional red or orange zones based on the field feedback and additional analysis at the state level. But they have been asked not to relax the zonal classification of districts classified as red or orange by the Union ministry. The Central government has emphasised that necessary action for containment be taken to break the chain of transmission of virus in both red and orange zone districts reporting confirmed cases.New criteria for containment zonesModifying the criteria for the demarcation of containment zones in districts, the MoHFW said that a residential colony/mohalla/municipal ward or police-station area/municipal zones/towns can be designated as containment zones in urban areas.The containment zones in these districts have to be delineated based on mapping of cases and contacts, geographical dispersion of cases and contacts, area with well demarcated perimeter and enforceability. For rural areas, villages/clusters of villages or group of police stations/gram panchayats/blocks can be designated as containment zones.“The area should be appropriately defined by the district administration/local urban body with technical inputs from the local level,” the communication said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hotspots-in-haryana-punjab-hp-and-j-k-down-to-10-many-districts-in-orange-zone-now/story-Cz27GnK8VIBgl80275cGNK.html

Gehlot said efforts should be made to revive economic activities while containing the spread of coronavirus.“Along with lockdown, it is equally important to run economic activities. If all activities are shut for a long period, it will create a financial crisis and that will make fight against corona more difficult,” he said.Health minister Raghu Sharma informed that the state’s capacity to test samples has increased to 9,100 per day which will further enhanced to 10,000 testings per day.Chief Secretary D B Gupta, ACS (Home) Rajeeva Swarup, ACS (Industry) Subodh Agrawal and other senior officials were present in the meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/cm-ashok-gehlot-asks-officials-to-make-arrangements-for-return-of-migrants/story-qLKoW2eBGGGgq95J3HA3QL.html

The MC too has been carrying out sanitisation of the city in a phased manner.Apart from her husband, the 44-year-old woman, a post office agent, was the prime source of infection for her 14-year-old daughter and seven other family members, who were discharged on April 26. Besides, two men aged 18 and 68, who had attended Delhi’s Tablighi Jamaat event and were residents of Banoi Khuda Baksh village in Pinjore, were discharged from the Civil Hospital in Sector 6. Till April 1, city had only two cases, which later spiked to 18 by April 20.Panchkula deputy commissioner (DC) Mukesh Kumar Ahuja said the administration’s preparedness and proactive working process controlled community infection. He said the health department was active since the first case was reported at Kharak Mangoli village and the area was declared containment zone. “Declaration of areas as containment and buffer zones and intensive screening and testing also helped,” he added.Civil surgeon Dr Jasjeet Kaur said after the Sector 15 woman had tested positive, the containment strategy was immediately put in place and contact tracing carried out vigorously. Samples of 147 persons were taken of which eight of her family members tested positive. The sector was declared containment zone with its adjoining areas as buffer zone. Entry and exit of persons was prohibited and home delivery of essential items ensured.The health department also conducted house-to-house surveillance and covered around 2,397 houses, screening 13, 791 persons in the sector. To date, 22 teams have screened 41,293 people. About 12 mobile medical teams are pressed into service.Besides declaring the localities as containment zones, the administration sealed all entry points to and from Dera Bassi in Punjab. Also, 18 villages in the district where Tablighi Jamaat attendees stayed after returning from Delhi had been contained.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-new-case-in-panchkula-in-10-days-with-17-cured-and-only-1-positive-case-steps-to-control-covid-19-paying-off/story-SmE0zT2X0x66wcyv5BXImK.html

This was followed by the administration declaring the entire city a containment zone on April 18, thereby restricting residents’ movement.UT is also considering excluding some areas from the containment zone.In the daily review meeting, Punjab governor and UT administrator VPS Badnore held discussions with UT adviser Manoj Kumar Parida, UT finance secretary Ajoy Kumar Sinha and other senior officers on suggestions received from various stakeholders regarding the exit plan after May 3.Parida had constituted a five-member committee headed by Sinha on April 27 to examine and recommend steps to be taken by the administration in the post-curfew period in the city. After further discussions with MP Kirron Kher, political parties and taking opinion of the medical community and other stakeholders, a final decision will be taken by the administrator. “The positive cases have increased to 74. In this scenario, it will be difficult for the administration to introduce major relaxations,” said a senior UT official.Badnore advised PGIMER, GMCH-32 and GMSH-16 to gradually open up facilities for non-Covid patients, as those requiring urgent attention should not be neglected. The hospitals should also facilitate their transportation to and fro from the houses. Private clinics have also been told to open up their facilities in line with Union health ministry’s guidelines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/retained-in-red-zone-list-chandigarh-mulling-relaxations/story-qEHVXmvbDvwbNmIvgYzECP.html
01-05-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh saw wettest April in 12 years, May to bring in more rain||In a pleasant start to the summer, Chandigarh saw 63.1mm rain in April, making it the wettest since 2008, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD). May is also expected to kickstart with light to moderate showers from Friday.Majority of the rain last month, at 40.3mm, was on April 18, an all-time record for the wettest April day as per IMD. The second highest April rain in the past 12 years was recorded in 2012 at 60.6mm, while the all-time record is 109.3mm from April 1983.Speaking about the excessive rainfall this year, IMD director of the region, Surender Paul said, “There was a confluence between low-level easterly winds and moisture coming to the region from the Arabian Sea, along with Western Disturbances. Usually in April and May, only Western Disturbances are observed, which is why rainfall is generally lower.”MORE RAIN ON THE CARDSPaul said the same effect was likely to continue in May as well. “Right at the start, a system of Western Disturbances will be active in the region. For the next seven days, chances of light to moderate rain up to 30mm will continue in the region, including Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh. Gusty winds up to 40km per hour and thunder can also be expected,” he said.“Around May 5, another system of Western Disturbances is expected to hit the region, so the intensity of rain will be the highest on May 5 and 6. This will continue into the month and more rain can be expected in the weeks thereafter,” he said, adding that farmers participating in the wheat procurement process need to be careful especially on May 5 and 6.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-saw-wettest-april-in-12-years-may-to-bring-in-more-rain/story-CstX6CqIUU2neju7jzt37N.html

With this, all five jamaat members who had tested positive in Ambala have recovered.The man was traced on March 31, along with 35 others from the community, under a state-wide drive to identify people who had returned from Nizamuddin after attending a religious congregation there in March. The 55-year-old tested positive for Covid-19 on April 2, along with a Nepalese man, who was discharged on April 11 from the civil hospital in Ambala Cantonment.Chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Kuldeep Singh said, “The Maharashtra man was discharged from PGIMER on Thursday and has been asked to remain in quarantine for next 14 days. Although, he had recovered from Covid-19 disease earlier, he was undergoing treatment for another ailment. Now, there are two active cases in Ambala. One of them is undergoing treatment at PGIMER and another at GMCH, Sector 32, Chandigarh.”“The health department on Thursday also took samples of 39 pilgrims, who returned from Hazur Sahib, Nanded, and were taken to Punjab.

01-05-2020||Chandigarh||Lockdown blues: Private sports academies in Chandigarh struggle to cope with no income||For sports, the worst of Covid-19 does not seem to be over yet. At this time of the year, the grassroots academies generally prepare for the post-exam rush but have now been left struggling to come to terms with the Covid-19 lockdown. While the bigger associations and their academies can withstand the impact, it’s the smaller centres, which serve as future players’ first contact with the game, that are hit the hardest. Two of the most popular sports in terms of number of privately-run academies in tricity — cricket and tennis — employ many coaches and also ground staff, and are struggling to make ends meet. With around 60 academies for these two games, many stakeholders doubt they will be able to sustain financially. “It is a very difficult period for everyone. A lot of parents enrol their wards in sports post exams. I am not sure whether parents will send their children for practice after the lockdown ends, so monetary loss is something that everyone will have to bear,” says Sumandeep, who runs a cricket academy in a Mohali school and trains 45 trainees from Under-6 to Under-16 age groups. There are around 30 cricket academies in the tricity. Coach Devinder Kapoor of Total Tennis Academy, which has its main centre in YMCA, Sector 11, and seven others in the tricity, adds that the loss of source of income has affected everyone in the sports academies’ circuit. “Yes, the players are suffering, but so are the coaches and centre owners. We have tie-ups with various schools besides a centre in YMCA. We are dipping into our savings and trying to secure loans in order to help our coaches and groundsmen. April was generally when the rush started, we had on an average 60-70 players per centre and even more in some places, and the footfall of four-five months during the summer season is enough to sustain us for the year. But with no income, we are trying to give salaries and let see how long can we sustain,” Kapoor says. Former state-level cricketer Ravi Verma runs three academies — two in Kharar and one in Chandigarh — with over 100 trainees. But since mid-March his centres are deserted. He is now living off his savings. “Since the lockdown, I have lost around Rs 2 lakh. I am paying the groundsmen and the team of coaches and also looking after my family. It is difficult to make the trainees learn from videos and analyse their skills. It is yet to be seen how many of the budding cricketers will resume training and also maintain social distancing along with wearing masks. Covid-19 has changed the way we live,” says Verma.Parveen Sharma recently started a cricket academy at a school in Sector 24 and hired services of four coaches, including former India cricketer Dinesh Mongia and former Himachal Pradesh Ranji Trophy cricketer Rajeev Nayyar. With such eminent cricketers at the helm of coaching, more than 60 trainees joined. “Tricity has wonderful cricket academies. With idols like Kapil Dev and Yuvraj Singh, youngsters want to emulate them and learn the sport. But even if we open, we will have to maintain social distancing. Until a vaccine is invented, life cannot return to be normal especially for sports,” says Sharma.Another tennis coach Anupam Chetri, who assists in a few academies in the tricity, adds that he is afraid some might close in the near future. “Financially, it will be become unsustainable if this lockdown drags on,” he says.Another tennis coach Vikas Berwal, who has two centres in Chandigarh and Hisar, says he has to pick and choose while releasing salaries for his staff of five coaches and three groundstaff. “While the ground staff got the entire salary and will continue to get it in April. I asked some of the well-off coaches to take a pay cut and released salaries for others,” he says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/lockdown-blues-private-sports-academies-in-chandigarh-struggle-to-cope-with-no-income-scenario/story-Idv70w8qfXc4w1QJkMuXQP.html

Besides, around 40 staffers of the shelter home, including counsellors and security personnel, have been isolated at the Government Rehabilitation Institute for Intellectual Disabilities (GRIID), Sector 31, said Preeti Arun, joint director of GRIID.“In the residential facility of Aashreya, inmates are quarantined in cubicles consisting of four beds with attached washrooms,” said Arun, adding that arrangements had been made for staff in GRIID classrooms with attached washrooms as the school was already shut because of the lockdown.GRIID staff is now doubling up to keep the shelter home running. The woman sweeper who has tested positive is the sister and a primary contact of the OT attendant of Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Sector 32, who had attended his marriage anniversary party at Bapu Dham. Arun said, “Resident of Sector 52, the woman had herself told us on April 24 that her brother had tested positive. After that, we asked her not to report to work, and immediately prepared a fresh duty roster for the staff.”She added, “There was another staffer who was in contact with a suspected coronavirus patient. After these two cases came to fore, we were expecting that we might have to quarantine the children and were ready.”Arun said, “We have requested the administration to send a team of doctors to take samples of inmates in the shelter home itself. They will be tested tomorrow.” UT director health services G Dewan and GMCH director-principal Dr BS Chavan could not be contacted for comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/inmates-staff-quarantined-as-chandigarh-shelter-home-sweeper-tests-positive/story-G5G66HOaAfqFddZTDacuhP.html

Currently, CITCO has around 700 regular and 650 contractual staff, whose one-month salary amounts to Rs 5.5 crore.With yearly turnover of around Rs 500 crore, CITCO owns some prime properties in Chandigarh, including five-star hotels, restaurants bars, sales depots, lakes, gardens and a petrol pump. The pandemic has, however, hit the corporation’s business hard.‘NO BUSINESS AT ALL’A contractor providing manpower to the corporation, requesting anonymity, said, “How will I pay when there is no business at all? If the situation continues, I will be left with no option but to send my staff on leave without pay.”Showing concern over the financial crisis, the chairman of the CITCO union, Kashmir Chand said, “The petrol pumps still open have also lost around 95% of the business, while the rest 5% are continuing on credit. Also, there won’t be immediate revival of the industry even after the lockdown gets over. That’s why we need the administration’s help to sustain.”CITO chairman Arun Kumar Gupta said the administration was considering the demand for the grant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/business-hit-citco-seeks-16cr-from-chandigarh-admn-for-salaries-bills/story-6Dk3vJDwqR3qf6UMZom5BJ.html

The petition sought urgent directions on the grounds that if Thackeray is not appointed as an MLC, he will cease to be the CM from May 28, which will lead to administrative uncertainties at the time of Covid-19 pandemic in the state.The petition, filed by social activist Surinder Arora through senior advocate Satish Talekar, claimed that if state Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari does not act upon the cabnet’s proposal it would lead to ‘administrative uncertainties, destabilisation of the government, social chaos and political disorder in wake of Covid-19 outbreak.’ The petition added that the Governor is bound by the aid and advise of the cabinet but the BJP, ‘as a part of its political game plan’ is trying to make Thackeray step down as CM with the help of the Governor. The plea further states that Thackeray could be nominated as an MLC under Article 171 (5) of the Constitution, which states that members to be nominated to the legislative Council by the Governor shall have special knowledge or practical experience in literature, science, art, cooperative movement and social service, and Thackeray been a professional photographer, editor and social worker. The petition was mentioned today in the HC and has sought for an urgent hearing on May 5.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/petition-filed-in-hc-to-direct-governor-to-nominate-thackeray-as-mlc-within-three-days/story-yHEnEfnVCI6BnAXlcBuC1I.html

01-05-2020||Lucknow||Lockdown flouted at many ghats in Sangam city||Fishermen and suppliers of illegal countrymade liquor are allegedly active around many Ganga and Yamuna ghats during the ongoing nationwide lockdown. They allegedly move on boats in groups and supply the countrymade liquor at a time when English liquor shops are closed. They also violate social distancing norms issued by the government. Restrictions are only being followed near Sangam and other adjoining ghats.The localities and villages on the banks of rivers Ganga and Yamuna are dominated by boatmen community whose members usually rely on plying boats and fishing for earning their living.Hundreds of boats also ferry pilgrims in Sangam waters but activity at the holy place has been restricted following the lockdown.Water police incharge Kadedeen Yadav said all boatmen at Sangam were issued strict warning to comply with the restrictions, action was also taken against some boatmen who violated the lockdown.A resident of Karelabagh area of Kareli on the condition of anonymity said some boatmen continued with fishing activities despite lockdown. Fishing nets are being used frequently at Kakraha Ghat, Subban Ghat, Mahewa, Mohabbatganj and nearly all ghats on both banks of Yamuna. As fish markets at Kareli, Lukarganj, Moti Mahal, Gaughat and other areas are not allowed to run, the fish are sold at the ghats usually on higher rates than earlier. Assembly of fish sellers and buyers could be seen in the evenings at Subban ghat and other ghats of Yamuna, he claimed.At many ghats like the Gaughat, people are also bathing every evening in large groups, he claimed.Some boats used for hooch supply can be spotted at the ghats in Naini area throughout the day, some local residents alleged.While cops regularly patrol roads and streets, their absence at river ghats is posing threat of coronavirus spread in the localities on the river banks as many persons cross the river and come back all through the day with little precautions, residents added.SP city Brajesh Kumar Srivastava said although he had yet not received any reports of lockdown violation at the ghats, strict action would be taken against those found violating the guidelines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/lockdown-flouted-at-many-ghats-in-sangam-city/story-aWfvWR2GseQu2Ou3IBbEwN.html
01-05-2020||Mumbai||Scientists bust myths about ‘immunity-boosting’ substances in fighting Covid-19||Indian scientists on Thursday released a statement against the promotion of “immunity-boosting substances” to protect oneself from being infected with the novel coronavirus. Citing lack of scientific evidence, scientists said consuming mustard oil or tea, homaeopathic solutions or ayurvedic preparations, or modern medicines like hydroxychloroquine that are claimed to provide either immunity or cure “do not provide any known and/or validated protection against Covid-19”.Any substance is considered effective only after rigorous testing through randomised clinical trials with Covid-19 patients, and additional laboratory analyses, the scientists said.Additionally, drinking cow urine, wearing talismans, exposure to ultraviolet light or injecting disinfectants are harmful to the human body, while excess consumption of supplements such as zinc or datura seeds can prove to be fatal.Aniket Sule, astrophysicist at Homi Bhabha Centre for Science Education and one of the signatories, said, “Since the beginning of Covid-19 epidemic, several statements have propagated ‘immunity-boosting’ substances. Some assertions were also supported by a few government functionaries at the Centre and in various states; and we, therefore, wanted to place scientific facts in the public domain.”Explaining how an individual develops immunity against a bacterium or a virus, the statement reads, “Either we were infected and recovered from the illness, or we are vaccinated; in either case we develop antibodies that can target the specific virus or bacterium...The most severe cases of Covid-19 are made worse by an overreaction of the immune system. So trying to boost general immunity using untested methods may be risky.”The scientific community has urged citizens to continue wearing masks, wash hands, and follow physical distancing protocols.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/scientists-bust-myths-about-immunity-boosting-substances-in-fighting-covid-19/story-MzudJeEFcwnDxR6NpbLhlN.html

01-05-2020||City||Innovation takes centre stage as UP villages aim to keep virus out||Lilawati Devi, the unlettered gram pradhan (head) of Bhujawal Khurd village in Kushinagar and Poonam Singh, the MBA-holder gram pradhan of Didauli village in Rae Bareli, are united by the common concern of protecting their villages from coronavirus infection.Little wonder, villages in Uttar Pradesh are witnessing musical jan jagran (awareness campaign), raising anti-corona task force, devising indigenous home delivery models, stitching masks and distributing soap. They have also set up WhatsApp groups for sharing needs, news, problems and concerns and ensured the menfolk seal borders to bar foreign entry. That’s not all. Amid the crisis, these women are also presenting a humane face.While in some isolated incidents in urban centres vegetable vendors have been targeted on their religious identity, villagers are verifying the vegetable vendors more out of security concerns.“Our village is on the Nepal border. Vendors come to our village to sell vegetables, fruits, milk and other essentials. We have prepared a list of all such vendors with their name, number and other details for verification. Any new vendor is subjected to interrogation by villagers, though there is no classification on religious lines,” said Pratima Mishra, 36, a graduate from Luchuiya village in Siddharthnagar, a district with significant migration to Mumbai and Delhi. Along with her husband Pawan, the graduate village head, the couple have devised the doorstep delivery model to guard against overcrowding. All outsiders were sent to quarantine centres in the village and allowed to go home after 14 days in isolation.“In these times, women are playing a huge role in making people aware. Women understand women better and so their support is crucial in creating awareness,” said Pawan.In Chandwara village in Barabanki, village head Prakashini Jaiswal, 38, has, with the help of her husband Rituraj, deployed National Cadet Corps (NCC) members to maintain social distancing.“We have fixed the time for procuring vegetables. Between 6am and 9am, all the villagers who require vegetables come out to get veggies. Social distancing is strictly ensured,” she says. Most of the villagers who returned home after the lockdown and quarantine have now been checked. “There were 13 Jamaatis too in the village but all have tested negative. They are still in the village but it’s ok. In these times, all have to help each other. Only one person is in quarantine now and food for that person is prepared in our house,” Jaiswal said.In March, while preparing food for quarantined people in her village, Lilawati Devi, the village head of Bhujawal Khurd in Kushinagar, faced an uncomfortable moment.“One of the five persons refused to have food prepared by me, saying I was a dalit. I had prepared the food because the village cook had refused to serve means to them, saying he feared going near them. The accusation stung. After intervention, all got sorted out,” says Lilawati. Then, there is Poonam Singh, 30, the modern village head of Didauli in Rae Bareli. She says her village started stitching masks before others.“I think much before anyone started making homemade masks, we had started stitching masks at home for public distribution. All those village women who knew how to stitch were engaged in that task,” says Poonam.To create awareness, Poonam, along with her husband Raj Kumar, 37, who holds a Master of Computer Applications (MCA) degree, also distributed soap in her village.“I get my village sanitised twice every week and each person in the village has been motivated to do shram daan (voluntary labour) to ensure cleanliness,” she said.In Akbarpur village, women are part of a novel anti-corona task force raised by village pradhan Amit Dwivedi.“Women are able to convince women better and that makes a lot of difference. The anti corona task force has men too. But of course, making women aware is of huge importance and that makes a powerful, impactful statement,” said Dwivedi, 38.The anti-corona task force runs awareness campaigns, distributes soap, masks and other essentials, keeps villagers posted with news.In Latifpur village close to the state capital, Shweta Singh, the gram pradhan who holds an MCA degree, has launched a musical jan jagran (awareness campaign) in her village. With her team, she moves around the village playing cymbals. Another villager sings the lyrics penned by her that are aimed at creating awareness about social distancing protocols.Another person on ‘dhol’ completes the music party in the village, which has been regularly updating the villagers about the need to follow certain restrictions.“I go around making people learn the correct way to wash their hands. In fact, I believe not many know how to do that even in cities. Hence, I give special training to villagers on how wash hands properly. Our village has a WhatsApp group, a banking correspondent to take care of banking needs of the people. We are coming up with a novel waste segregation unit,” she says||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/innovation-takes-centre-stage-as-up-villages-aim-to-keep-virus-out/story-I7g6Lcs4NyaQQrZbpHIo6H.html

CareNx Technologies is a start-up incubated at the Desai Sethi School of Entrepreneurship of the institute that helps detect high-risk pregnancy cases and helps health workers connect such cases, particularly in rural areas for check-ups. The start-up manufactures pregnancy test kits which in combination with an easy-to-use mobile application measure blood pressure, haemoglobin count, urine and basic parameters of pregnant women.Amid the lockdown owing to the Covid-19 outbreak, the start-up is now also offering webinars with doctors. These webinars can be accessed by health workers in rural areas as well as expecting mothers and their families. Through the webinar, gynaecologists answer concerns that the expecting mothers may have about check-ups, delivery and even infection in newborns. According to Shantanu Pathak, co-founders of CareNx, the webinar titled ‘Don’t Panic, Protect’ is in partnership with renowned gynaecologists, doctors and counsellors. He claimed their mobile application is being used by frontline workers to counsel more than 10,000 pregnant women in remote areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/iit-bombay-start-up-conducts-pregnancy-counselling-webinars/story-iiC2ZC2CMIyv034ZDB9S9L.html
01-05-2020||Mumbai||Maha’s 1st trial: Covid patient who underwent plasma therapy dies||The Covid-19 patient from the city, who became the first in the state to undergo the convalescent plasma therapy, succumbed to the infection at Lilavati Hospital on Wednesday night. The condition of the 53-year-old man was critical and he was on ventilator support in the intensive care unit (ICU).The patient was brought to the hospital on April 20 after his swab test report came positive on April 19. Due to the delay in detection of the virus, he had already developed respiratory syndrome. He was immediately put on ventilator support in the ICU. According to doctors from the hospital, despite having symptoms such as sore throat, dry cough and fever, he delayed his treatment. As he didn’t have any travel history or wasn’t a high-risk close contact of any Covid-19 patient, he didn’t consider the possibility of having contracted the infection. “When the patient was brought to hospital, he had severe breathing problems due to the delay in treatment. He had developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and pneumonia,” said Dr V Ravishankar, CEO of Lilavati Hospital. On April 25, the hospital performed the first convalescent plasma therapy on the patient after procuring approval from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).The therapy involves transfusing plasma – a component of the blood – from a recovered patient into a patient fighting the infection, to act as reinforcement for the latter’s immune system. On the first day, 200ml of plasma was transfused. It helped him improve his oxygen intake. However, from the early morning of April 27, his condition started to deteriorate. He developed infections and was kept on high dosage of antibiotics. “We had to postpone the next two trials due to his deteriorating health. He succumbed to the infection on Wednesday night,” said Dr Ravishankar.Couldn’t even see him, says sonTalking to HT, the deceased patient’s elder son said as the whole family was under home quarantine, they couldn’t see him. “My father was on ventilator support. He couldn’t talk to us on call. We couldn’t see him as we are not allowed to leave home,” he said. The patient’s last rites were performed in Ghatkopar. His 26-year-old son has also tested positive and is presently undergoing treatment at Hiranandani Hospital, Powai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maha-s-1st-trial-covid-patient-who-underwent-plasma-therapy-dies/story-smPWHuhrG8vBWSG3lAJssL.html

So, I called the police control room and asked for help, and they obliged,” said Amanpreet Kaur, the toddler’s mother.Sunil Kumar, who is posted at Balongi police station, said they received information that the family residing in Sector 125, Sunny Enclave, wanted to celebrate their daughter’s first birthday, but, couldn’t step out amid the curfew. So, we picked up a cake from Phase 3B2 market in Mohali immediately and went to deliver it, he said. The society echoed with the sound of “Happy Birthday”, instead of sirens, as cops drove into the society. “It was my daughter’s first birthday, and we got disheartened that we would not be able to celebrate it. But, the police made it possible,” said Varun Dhauja, the girl’s father.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/mohali-police-makes-birthday-of-one-year-old-special-amid-covid-19-lockdown/story-WUYTTxLSQzIo3JFTSjAkwK.html
01-05-2020||Mumbai||Maha goes past grim 10,000 mark for Covid-19 infections||Maharashtra on Thursday passed the bleak 10,000 figure for coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases, 53 days since the first case on March 9, even as officials said the situation is under control. With 583 new infections, India’s worst-hit state’s tally rose to 10,498, while the toll stood at 459 with 27 more deaths. The state took 30 days to report its first 1,000 cases, which means the next 9,000 cases took only 23 days.On Thursday, 417 cases and 20 deaths were reported from Mumbai. The financial capital, with 7,061 cases, accounts for 67.2% of the state’s total. It also accounts for 63.18% of the state’s fatalities, with 290 deaths. A total of 1, 773 patients have recovered across the state so far, including 180 patients on Thursday. On an average, the state reported over 500 new cases daily since April 19. In the past twelve days (since April 19), the state has recorded 6,855 new cases. On Thursday, the state also completed 38 days of lockdown, imposed from the midnight of March 23, a day before the nationwide lockdown imposed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Officials claimed the situation is still under control as most of the new cases are from traced contacts. “Although a dip in new cases is yet to start, we can say that the situation is under control as we are aggressively doing contact tracing and most of the new cases are those who have been traced, following detection of cases,” said Dr Tatyarao Lahane, director, Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER). So far, the health department has conducted 1,45,798 tests at various public and private facilities across Maharashtra.Of them, 1,34,244 people tested negative. “We will have to wait for another incubation cycle of 14 days, which is ending on May 3, before arriving at any conclusion,” added Dr Lahane.The two 14-day cycles of the incubation period of infection was completed on April 20. It had begun from March 22, when international traffic was stopped. The state health minister, Rajesh Tope, said that the state is prepared for any situation. “We have set up 1,677 Covid-19 dedicated hospitals, where 1,76,357 isolated beds and 7,248 ICU beds are available. These hospitals are divided into three categories, between asymptomatic, mild and serious cases. We also have around 3,000 ventilators, around 80,000 personal protective equipment (PPE) kits and 2.82 lakh N95 masks,” he said.The state currently has 733 active containment zones. Around 10,092 survey teams, comprising doctors and assisting staff, have screened more than 42.11 lakh people. It has also kept 10,695 suspected patients at government quarantine facilities, while 1,68,266 are home quarantined, stated health officials.Of the 27 deaths reported on Thursday, 20 are from Mumbai, three in Pune, two in Thane and one each in Raigad and Nagpur. Of the day’s deaths, 22 patients had comorbidities, said health officials.The mortality rate of the state has come down to 4.36% (432 deaths till Wednesday), from 7.41% (148 cases) on April 13. However, it continued to be higher than the national mortality rate of 3.25% till Sunday, revealed the data of the state medical education department.Following complaints of hospitals denying admission to patients or delaying treatment, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Thursday ordered that no hospital can turn away any patient without examination and required intervention under any circumstances. All private and government hospitals in the state have also been directed to check any patient who is entering hospital premises and after scanning may be shifted or admitted, depending on the patient’s medical condition.As per the guidelines issued by the Centre, the state government has also ordered shifting of all asymptomatic patients without comorbid conditions to Covid Care Centres, whereas private hospitals can send such patients for home quarantine, but after proper counselling, stated the order issued by chief secretary Ajoy Mehta on Thursday. The order will come into force from May 2.The hospitals have been warned of action in case directives are not followed scrupulously.The state government has also allowed migrant workers, pilgrims, tourists, students and other persons stranded at different places in Maharashtra to move out of the state. The state government has also allowed intra-state movement of such stranded persons, but with certain conditions. An order to this effect was issued by chief secretary Ajoy Mehta on Thursday.The state government has further declared that all undergraduate and post-graduate theory and practical examinations conducted by Maharashtra University of Health Sciences (MUHS), Nashik for summer (2020) has been postponed till further notice, owing to the unprecedented situation caused by the Covid-19 outbreak. The decision was taken following recommendations made by a committee formed to suggest the options. State medical education minister Amit Deshmukh made the announcement on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maha-goes-past-grim-10-000-mark-for-covid-19-infections/story-SuGJYyB6Oi4QIzjl05fNIM.html
01-05-2020||Lucknow||Rope in migrants to transform parishadiya schools, says UP chief secy||Chief secretary, Rajendra Kumar Tiwari, on Thursday directed the district administrations to provide necessary infrastructure to all Parishadiya schools (government schools up to class eight) under ‘Operation Kayakalp’ (transformation) with panchayat funds.“The parishadiya schools will also be assessed and graded on the basis of the infrastructure and amenities,” said the chief secretary while directing the officials to start the required construction works immediately in a time-bound manner. He also directed officers to employ migrant labourers for the job so that they also get a livelihood.Tiwari added that in the first phase, all these schools should have clean drinking water, separate washrooms for boys and girls, water supply in the washrooms, separate washrooms for physically challenged, multiple handwashing units, floor tiling in classrooms, blackboards, kitchens, ramps for physically challenged, colouring of walls, power connection and necessary power equipment.Tiwari said that migrant labourers are under quarantine at these schools these days and it would be a good idea to employ them in construction activities as it would consolidate the school infrastructure and at the same time provide a livelihood to migrants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/rope-in-migrants-to-transform-parishadiya-schools-says-up-chief-secy/story-keVcEwJiOaypBCN456pncO.html
01-05-2020||Chandigarh||Spurt in cases: Chandigarh admn’s containment efforts come a cropper||The UT administration’s coronavirus disease (Covid-19) containment efforts have come under scanner amid steep rise in cases in the last five days. Even as the city has been under lockdown since March 24, infection has spread to newer areas. Chandigarh has been designated a red zone and containment zone.The initial spurt in positive cases in the city, first case being on March 18, came from foreign returned persons and their contacts. After a lull of almost a week, the pattern changed, with healthcare workers from two public sector hospitals reporting positive. In the last week, the infection spread to peripheral areas and colonies, particularly, Bapu Dham and Sector 30, taking the tally of positive cases from 27 on April 24 to 74 on April 30.SOCIAL DISTANCING IN COLONIES“In places like Mauli Jagran, people can be seen roaming freely on streets with no social distancing norms being followed. The administration’s move to distribute cooked food also creates unnecessary crowding in these areas. It is a very alarming situation,” said Paveela Bali, a city-based social activist, who is actively distributing ration in colonies.In a recent incident of crowd mismanagement, huge crowds of people thronged streets in Mauli Jagran when administration officials came to distribute food. Even after repeated warnings, administration has been slow to react and rectify the situation, critics say. BELOW PAR TESTINGExperts say testing in the city is below par even as administration contends it is following protocol.Till Wednesday, Chandigarh reported 68 cases and tested only 1,013 people, while Mohali with 73 infections tested 1,411. Panchkula, with only 18 cases, has tested 1,525 persons, highest in the tricity. Chandigarh has an estimated population of 14 lakh, Panchkula 6.6 lakh and Mohali 10 lakh.Dr RS Bedi, former president of Chandigarh’s Indian Medical Association and adviser, World Medical Association, said, “Today, after 36 days of lockdown, we are at a stage in Chandigarh where cases are still on the rise. Besides social distancing, we need to undertake aggressive and random testing throughout the city to locate infected people as cases are scattered.”“We have to follow guidelines of Indian Council of Medical Research for testing. More testing without following guidelines is not an achievement,” a senior UT official said.HEALTH WORKERS TESTING POSITIVEAs many as 15 healthcare workers from PGIMER and GMCH-32 have tested positives so far, and some of their contacts have also contracted the infection. But, what is more worrisome, is that nearly 75% of them were working in ‘emergency’ areas, dealing with non-Covid-19 patients.Experts blamed it on health authorities’ delay in allowing provision of PPE kits to health workers working in emergency areas. “The authorities should not hesitate in providing proper protection gear to the health workers, and this should have been done from the start,” said Dr Neeraj Nagpal, convener, Medicos Legal Action Group.As per the central government’s guidelines for containment zone, “active search for cases” has to be done. Questions have been raised over administration’s claims to have screened more than 9 lakh people. Facing flak, the health department even conceded that it is not screening per se, but only conducting survey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-administration-s-containment-efforts-come-under-scanner-as-cases-continue-to-rise/story-w5E1WID6zHoYJpAp6DpH5N.html
01-05-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai cops remove over 650 misleading social media posts on Covid-19, hate messages||Mumbai Police have pulled down over 650 objectionable messages including misleading posts on Covid-19, hateful messages, communal posts, false and fake news linking to the disease, and other such content from various social media platforms since the beginning of the lockdown till Thursday morning.Five FIRs have also been registered in this regard, said a senior police officer from city police.“The state cyber police have taken down 60 such posts and 155 accused arrested so far, said Harish Baijal, deputy inspector general of state cyber police. A senior police officer from city police on Thursday told HT that the Social Media Lab (SML) of Special Branch-1, the intelligence wing of Mumbai police, has pulled down 550 objectionable posts during the lockdown period. “These posts were highly misleading, baseless and had potential to trigger panic among people and also communal tension in the city,” the officer said.The officer further added that the messages circulating initially on the social media platforms had misinformation regarding coronavirus, but later, messages on the Tablighi Jamaat incident of Delhi spread like wildfire.DCP (Cyber) Vishal Thakur said, “The Cyber police station have removed over 100 objectionable content from the internet platforms during the lockdown.”“We keep a close eye on trends and patterns and analyse them to identify the platforms or groups which are regularly spreading such inflammatory videos or posts. Then appropriate action is taken against such elements,” another officer said.A team of 30 highly trained, technologically sound, multilingual dedicated policemen of SML works in three shifts to keep an eagle’s eye on the suspicious activities on various social media platforms.They look for objectionable content on popular platforms with the help of advanced filter tools. Once detected, the content is immediately blocked or removed with the help of the service providers. Members of this team are regularly given training by Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT), anti-terror agencies and other government agencies about the new tools, filters and soft-wares that can be used to trace trouble makers operating online.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-cops-remove-over-650-misleading-social-media-posts-on-covid-19-hate-messages/story-Ck5j236EPmcsS4jolhjTCL.html
01-05-2020||Lucknow||Nine sectors will take time to revive; will need package: IIA||The Indian Industries Association (IIA) has sought help from the Centre for revival of nine prominent sectors which are likely to suffer for a longer time even after the post-lockdown period.Sharing a report of the Dun & Bradstreet, a prominent research and data analysis agency, the IIA has listed out nine priority sectors out of 16 for revival when nationwide lockdown is lifted.HighlightsWorst affected sectors--Tourism, Automobile, Entertainment, Electronics, Hospitality, Banking, Jewellery, Real Estate small and medium business sector. Sectors which will revive soon--Drug and Pharmaceutical, Retail, Wholesale trade, Textile, Livestock, Logistics, Metal. “Of 16 prominent sectors that propel economy, nine such as tourism, automobile, entertainment, electronics, hospitality, banking, jewellery, small and medium business will face slowdown for a longer duration due to COVID-19 pandemic,” said Pankaj Kumar, national president, IIA, a lobby body of the MSME sector.“Our analysis is also the same. In Uttar Pradesh, these nine sectors will face more crises as compared to industrial states like Gujarat, Maharashtra and southern states like Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Telangana,” added Kumar, demanding a special package for them.Drug and Pharmaceutical, Retail, Wholesale trade, Textile and livestock will recover from the present crisis soon.Similarly, logistic and metal sector will also be able to come out of the present crisis soon, says the report.“The banking sector will face problem as non-performing assets (NPA) will mount due to unpaid loans,” said Kumar.The tourism sector is considered as the most employment generating and labour intensive sector. This sector will be worst affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and will take more than one financial year to recover.Footfall of foreign tourists will be almost negligible for around a year due to financial constraints and social distancing norms. Air travel will also become expensive, says the report.“In such a scenario, we will have to depend heavily on domestic tourism and some assistance from the government for revival of tourism sector will be needed,” said Kumar.Due to slump in economy, demand for electronic goods will also go down, says the report.

01-05-2020||Mumbai||Arunachal’s hydro project puts habitat of 25 globally threatened species, ancient trees at threat: BNHS to Centre||The habitat of 25 globally threatened species – 19 birds and six mammals – among other flora and fauna, face threat owing to the proposed Etalin hydroelectric power project in Arunachal Pradesh’s Dibang Valley, the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) has said.Earlier this week, BNHS had submitted a letter to the chairman of the forest advisory committee (FAC), a body constituted under the Union environment ministry, strongly opposing the project and calling it “a fit case to be out rightly rejected”. BNHS has shared a copy of its letter with HT.The proposed project site, 14km from the protected areas of the Dibang Wildlife Sanctuary, will require the diversion of 1,150.08 hectare (ha) forest land for the 3,097 megawatt (MW) hydroelectric project, which is expected to be one of the largest in India.BNHS, which has carried out research across the Dibang Biosphere Reserve part of Mishmi Hill for more than two years, said over five lakh trees would be lost for the project, contrary to the current estimate. “The regional office of the Union environment ministry in its site inspection report had not recommended the proposal in the present form for forest clearance. It had raised concerns that the enumeration of trees has not reflected the ground reality as huge trees (old-growth) are not identified in the final list,” the BNHS letter read.Deepak Apte, director of BNHS, who drafted the letter, said, “The decision to grant forest clearance for this project is not just unprecedented but most tragic and unfortunate. We thought the Covid-19 pandemic has taught us lessons to respect nature but it isn’t the case. We request environment minister Prakash Javadekar to intervene, and not to grant final clearance for this project and save this pristine forest,” added Apte. Though the minutes of last Thursday’s meeting on the final approval for the project is awaited, an FAC sub-committee had recommended it citing economic remuneration for wildlife conservation. “A decision will be taken regarding the feasibility of the project once we see the FAC minutes of the meeting,” an official from the Union environment ministry told HT on the issue. Around 680 bird species have been recorded from the region, accounting for 56% of the total bird species in the country, BNHS has said. Among the 19 globally threatened species, four are ‘critically endangered’, including the Bengal Florican, White-rumped vulture, Slender-billed vulture, and Red-headed vulture, while two others – Greater adjutant and Black-bellied tern – are in the ‘endangered’ category. Thirteen ‘vulnerable’ species include three rare range restricted endemic birds (Chestnut-breasted partridge, Blyth’s Tragopan, and Sclater’s Monal). The habitat of six globally threatened mammals was also at risk, including the endangered Hoolock gibbon, red panda, and Bengal tiger, and vulnerable species such as the leopard, Mishmi takin, and Chinese goral.Apte added that the entire region falls under two categories designating high protection by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), Endemic Bird Area, Global Biodiversity Hotspot and Key Biodiversity Area, all indicating its importance at the global scale.“It is not just about how many trees are felled, it is about the whole ecosystem and ecosystem services we take down with it,” said Apte.Two dams will be built over two rivers (Dri and Talon) with an underground powerhouse downstream having turbine units. The letter raises an alarm that the project site was in a seismically active zone (Zone V) in the Himalayan belt which has reported four earthquakes in Talon River basin in 2008, 1997, 1993, and 1983 ranging between 3.7 and 5 on the Richter Scale. “This makes it vulnerable to natural disasters. It not only threatens life of people downstream but also threatens the larger landscape in Brahmaputra flood plains,” said Apte.BNHS suggested that the FAC should protect the area in accordance with the National Forest Policy, 1988. “Since India is committed to the Paris Agreement for reducing deforestation and adding additional forest areas, in a biodiversity rich area such as this, the FAC should avoid diversion of forest land,” the letter added.Meanwhile the Mishmi indigenous communities from Arunachal Pradesh have also placed their concerns before the Union environment ministry over the project. “There are gross anomalies and contradictions in the Wildlife Institute of India’s study in clear violations of FAC’s recommendation. We want studies to be re-conducted in a transparent, factual, and scientific manner. However, such studies cannot be impartial unless there is a clear case of conflict of interest. We request ministry to look into these anomalies without bothering to decorate an environment management plan,” said Tilu Linggi, representing members of the Kera-Initiatives for Cultural and Ecological Security (KICES), a grassroots NGO and Mishmi indigenous communities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/arunachal-s-hydro-project-puts-habitat-of-25-globally-threatened-species-ancient-trees-at-threat-bnhs-to-centre/story-Mn5GImPBM53CIpRMMie18O.html

All the pilgrims who have been found carrying the infection were asymptomatic and it came as a surprise for all, officials said.With this, 183 pilgrims who returned from Nanded have been found positive since their arrival in Punjab which started on April 25.With Punjab’s Covid-19 patient tally reaching 544, of which 200 recorded in the last two day, pilgrims from Nanded now contributes to more than 33% of the total cases in the state.The number is likely to rise further as only the reports of around 1,200 of 2,500 tested till now have arrived and the rest are awaited by late evening or by Friday morning.There are around 3,500 pilgrims who landed in Punjab in past three days as per the data shared by the officials in chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh’s videoconference with deputy commissioners, SSPs and police commissioners.Amritsar witnessed maximum 76 cases on Thursday, all Nanded pilgrims, while 37 of the 48 found positive in Ludhiana were also the pilgrims.The explosion of cases has doubled Punjab’s tally from 272 on April 23 to 544 on April 30. Punjab health officials have claimed that all Nanded pilgrims found positive were asymptomatic when their samples were taken.“The asymptomatic status means that despite the virus, the pilgrims kept on mingling with each other during their stay in Nanded and after their return to Punjab. It resulted in explosion in the cases,” a senior official dealing with Covid-19 cases said.Punjab government is already in the dock over asking the deputy commissioners to follow detailed Standard Operating Procedures on April 27, two days after start of the arrival of the pilgrims to the state. The state government allegedly was also clueless about the arrival of the pilgrims in private vehicles.Such was the casual approach of the department, as per an insider in the department, that in Amritsar district only, around 179 people were sent to ‘home quarantine’ on April 26 after their thermal scanning. “They were called back with the help of police only after four pilgrims were found positive in Tarn Taran,” said an official. In Ludhiana too, many people were called back from home quarantine.Top districts with positive pilgrimsAmritsar: 76Ludhiana: 48Mohali: 15Tarantaran: 14Kapurthala: 8||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/asymptomatic-nanded-pilgrims-catch-punjab-govt-unawares/story-yGrQwZCIzv1qrWEJdlcZZI.html

Its first report was submitted to Congress’s state unit chief Balasaheb Thorat recently. While speaking at a press conference on Thursday, Chavan and former Rajya Sabha member from Congress Bhalchandra Mungekar also demanded a stimulus package from the Centre for the states, worth 5 to 10% of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP). The report has also demanded more Covid-19 tests be conducted and improvement in the supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) to private doctors and hospitals in Maharashtra.“The Central government should pay the interest on farm loans taken by farmers for next six months while the electricity used by them for agricultural pumps too should be waived for six months. Similarly, Maharashtra government should set an example by providing a monthly unemployment allowance of Rs 5,000 for three months to people from unorganised sectors like farm labourers, hawkers, shopkeepers, auto-taxi drivers,” the report said. Chavan has demanded that the Central government announce a stimulus package of about Rs 21 lakh crore, which is 10% of the national GDP to help revive state economies.Congress criticises Governor Congress leaders criticised Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari of Maharashtra for the delay in the appointment of chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to the legislative council. Maharashtra Congress general secretary Sachin Sawant said, “Honourable Governor should take a decision on the matter by removing his cap [referring to the cap that is traditionally part of the uniform of Rashtriya Swayamsevak (RSS) members] on his head as it is playing a deterrent role in decision making.” Mungekar said, “Making Maharashtra politically unstable during the unprecedented challenging period of Covid-19 by not taking decision on Thackeray’s membership to the Upper House is uncalled for.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/give-free-power-farm-waiver-5-000-to-labourers-maharashtra-congress-task-force/story-GYbApbBz5r2w8Li0cFjt2O.html

01-05-2020||Mumbai||Hospitals can’t turn patients away without examination: Maharashtra government||After a number of complaints of hospitals denying admission to patients or delaying treatment, the Maharashtra government on Thursday issued an order that no hospital can turn away any patient without examination and required intervention under any circumstances. The order will come into effect from May 2.All private and government hospitals in the state have also been directed to check any patient who is entering the hospital premises, and shift or admit him, depending on the patient’s medical condition.Following the guidelines issued by the Centre, the state has also ordered shifting of all asymptomatic patients without co-morbid conditions to Covid Care Centres, whereas private hospitals can send such patients for home quarantine, but after proper counselling, states the order issued by chief secretary Ajoy Mehta on Thursday. The hospitals have been warned of action in case directives are not followed scrupulously. “Any patient entering the hospital premises for any treatment of Covid-19 or non Covid-19 ailment should be immediately checked in to casualty or screening clinic. After triage, the patient may be shifted or admitted. Depending upon the site condition, the staging area may be created for screening and triage of patients in isolation so that infections are not transmitted. No patient is to be turned away without examination and required intervention under any circumstances,” the order reads.The government has asked the directors of health services to prepare the standard operating procedure (SOP) for screening, transferring, admitting and discharging of patients. “Each patient needing hospital admission will be assigned a unique ID by the round-the-clock onsite team of the disaster management department (DMD) of the local body such as the BMC, without which admission cannot be granted. DMD should use this as a more accurate and efficient bed management in all hospitals,” it further states. “This will help in better calculation of beds in hospitals. So if any one calls helpline numbers, it will be easier to get details faster,” said a state health official.“For this, the state government has given them two days and hence the order will come into force from May 2,” said a senior official, wishing not to be named.“In order to decongest hospitals, all asymptomatic positive patients without comorbidity should be shifted to appropriate Covid Care Centres (CCC) immediately. All Covid-19 and non-Covid 19 hospitals are also directed to ensure that no admission is granted to asymptomatic positive patients without co-morbidity. Similar patients in private hospitals should be stamped and sent away for home quarantine after proper counselling, according to the Government of India guidelines,” it adds.The hospitals are also directed to collect swabs of all suspected Covid-19 patients admitted on top priority and ensure that reports are collected within 12 hours and ensure the patients are diagnosed as per clinical conditions and shifted to CCC, Dedicated Covid Health Centers (DCHC) for patients with mild symptoms and Dedicated Covid Hospitals (DCH) for serious patients. In case of death of a Covid-19 positive patient, the hospital administrations are also directed to ensure that the body is shifted from the ward within 30 minutes and disposed of within 12 hours for which necessary processes have to be defined keeping in view the prevalent regulations.“In Mumbai, the mobilisation of the ambulances should be controlled centrally by the Disaster Management Department of the BMC,” states the order. This is being done to ensure ambulances can be made available to the patients without any delay, said the senior official.Health experts have welcomed the move. “Patients run from pillar to post seeking treatment, but due to the lack of a proper guideline, they are being refused treatment. Doctors and staff are clueless how to manage patients. This will be helpful, but there is also a need for its proper implementation,” said Dr Ravikant Singh, a health activist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hospitals-can-t-return-patients-without-examination-govt/story-4Bm5mB42reb9RrBGq0gIJN.html

01-05-2020||Bangalore||Industries in K’taka may start from May 4||Karnataka chief minister B S Yediyurappa on Thursday announced that all industries in the state outside containment zones will be allowed to operate from May 4 a day after the extended lockdown imposed to check the Covid-19 spread will end. He said the Covid-19 cases might continue for another two to three months and added efforts to control the pandemic would go hand in hand with economic activity which has almost fully stopped due to the lockdown.Yediyurappa said the cases reported from Bengaluru have been coming down for the last two to three days but they will wait for a few more days to take a final decision on allowing economic activities in the city. Bengaluru, which has reported 147 of Karnataka’s 565 Covid-19 cases, has around 24 containment zones. The city is Karnataka’s economic engine and contributes nearly half of the state’s revenues.Yediyurappa said they have no plans for allowing malls, hotels or movie theatres to reopen and added the state would wait for Centre’s directives before taking a final decision.Yediyurappa later met representatives of associations of commerce and industries and asked them to be ready to resume operations. He appealed to the industrialists to pay wages and salaries to their employees.The Karnataka Cabinet met separately and decided to issue one-time permits for inter-state and inter-district for stranded migrants and labourers.Law minister J C Madhuswamy said the cost for the travel would be borne by those who want to travel and the government would merely provide permits and bus services. On Wednesday, another minister, Suresh Kumar, said the state government would bring back stranded people from Karnataka from Gujarat and buses would be sent for the purpose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/industries-in-k-taka-may-start-from-may-4/story-Gs4h4EMWUo9PITfGzxcbnN.html
01-05-2020||Mumbai||9 wards witness spike in doubling rate of Covid-19 cases; slowdown in 2 south Mumbai wards||Nine wards in Mumbai have recorded an alarming drop in the number of days it is taking for Covid-19 positive cases to double. This comes even as the overall doubling rate of the city improved from 8.3 to 10 days between April 17 and 27. Two wards in south Mumbai, A ward and B ward, have contributed to a decrease in the average doubling rate in the city. In B ward, it earlier took 5.4 days for cases to double, while now it takes approximately 37.6 days for the same. The A ward where earlier it took 3.4 days for cases to double, is now taking 34.2 days.While the city as a whole is now taking roughly two more days for the number of cases to double, the opposite is true for Chembur (M/West ward), Tardeo and Malabar Hill (D Ward), Bandra East (H/East ward), Marine Lines and Kalbadevi (C ward), Mulund (T ward), Sewri and Parel (F/South ward), Mankhurd (M/East ward), and areas of Dahisar and Borivali (R/North and R/Central ward).At these nine wards, cases are doubling faster, by anywhere between 0.9 days to 11.4 days. At least four of these wards are dominated by slums and densely populated chawls, such as the Mankhurd and Govandi area that saw a jump of 110 cases in 10 days; Bandra East which witnessed a spike of 156 cases; Parel and Sewri that saw a jump of 76 cases; Girgaum and Tardeo where cases rose by 121 in 10 days, and Kalbadevi that saw a jump of 21 cases. In the 10 days between April 17 and April 27, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) monitored and mapped the rise in the number of Covid-19 positive cases in all 24 administrative wards. This confirmed that the average doubling rate in the city had decreased.A senior civic official said, “It is good news as it implies cases are now multiplying more slowly and people are not transmitting the virus to each other as fast. As for the other nine wards, we have studied reasons for the decrease in doubling rate and are finding customised solutions for each case.”While it earlier took 16.9 days for the number of cases to double in R Central ward, it has now reduced to five days. Earlier it took 18 days for cases to double in R North ward, but now it takes nine days. Similarly, while earlier it took 13 days for cases to double in T ward, it reduced to 8.4 days.HT spoke to all ward officers or health officers of the nine wards, and each of them cited that one or a few large clusters were discovered in their ward. However, this was restricted to one area, or one building, or a single slum pocket, and hence, the spread will be easier to curb in the next few days.Swapnaja Kshirsagar, assistant commissioner of F South ward said, “In the past seven days, my ward organised two fever camps per day, and we discovered 33, 22, 34, and 20 cases on four days alone. I discovered a new slum pocket called India slum which had zero cases until one week ago. Then one positive patient was reported, who was on dialysis and must have caught the infection during his treatment. Fortunately, others who have tested positive are contacts of this patient, so cases are as of now restricted to one pocket.”Sheetal Mhatre, Shiv Sena corporator from R North ward said, “There has been one new index case living in a slum and the remaining are contacts of this patient.”As for the C ward, 1/3rd of its total cases have increased only in the past 3-4 days. A health official of the C ward said, “I had organised only one health camp, collected 18 swabs, and 12 of them tested positive. On three consecutive days, we identified 11 cases, seven cases, and five cases respectively. The C ward had managed to keep its cases down as there were more index patients and fewer contact patients. But on one these three days, we found many contact patients living in one building.”Ward officers believe that a change in policy helped them detect more cases. A senior civic official said, “More detection leads to more number of cases. Our fever camps and contact tracing has thrown up these numbers. To curb the spread of the virus in these wards, containment, and strict lockdown, shifting people to quarantine centres, and early detection is the key.”Kishor Gandhi, assistant commissioner of the T ward (Mulund) said, “There are 46 cases in my ward, of which 22 were found in the last 10 days from two large and densely populated slum pockets in my ward.” While the Ramgad slum in Mulund reported its first case on April 19 and then had a breather of a few days with no new cases, one testing cycle threw up 10 new cases in this slum. Similarly, one testing cycle in Indira Nagar slum in Mulund reported 11 new cases, after it had reported its first case on April 21.“The good thing is all these cases are high-risk contacts of positive patients and were already in quarantine. Since they were removed from the community, there may be no new threat,” said Gandhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/9-wards-witness-spike-in-doubling-rate-of-covid-19-cases-slowdown-in-2-south-mumbai-wards/story-MVbhmLihbEfOhleqvwXqLL.html
01-05-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt notifies home isolation guidelines for ‘mild’ cases of Covid-19||A Covid-19 patient living at home will have his/her left hand stamped stating “committed to home isolation” and will have to remain in the designated room for at least 16 days, the Delhi government’s home isolation guidelines, released on Thursday, said. This comes two days after the Centre allowed home isolation of positive patients, keeping in mind the rising number of cases and the strain they put on hospital infrastructure.A consultative meeting of Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain, health secretary Padmini Singla, director general of health services Dr Nutan Mundeja and medical director of Lok Nayak hospital Dr JC Passey, among others, was held Wednesday to finalise the standard operating procedures (SOPs) for home isolation.So far, 3,515 cases and 59 deaths have been reported in the city.Data shows that around 43% of all active Covid-19 cases – those still with the infection – are admitted to the Covid-19 care centre with mild symptoms. These people will be eligible for home isolation if they have adequate facility – a separate bedroom and bathroom at home.Once a person tests positive, the new SOPs state that the surveillance team will call to check if (s)he has mild or moderate symptoms. Anyone with moderate symptoms such as high fever or breathing difficulty, and those with comorbid conditions such as diabetes or hypertension will be moved to a Covid health centre or hospital.If symptoms are mild and the person has no comorbid conditions, then a health team will visit the house to check the person and the house to see if it can be used for isolation. If yes, then the team will get an undertaking from the patient that (s)he will remain in isolation and call them in case symptoms worsen. The patient will be stamped on the left hand and made to download Arogya Setu app, which will track the person’s movements. A home isolation sticker will also be put up outside the residence.The person will be allowed to come out of isolation only after two of his/her tests come negative for Covid-19. If not, the isolation can be extended and the right hand of the person will be stamped, the guidelines stated. The patient’s condition will be checked every day over phone by the district health teams and treatment has to be sought if there is difficulty breathing, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, mental confusion, or bluish discolourations on the body.“It is impossible to assess someone’s condition over phone; a physical check is necessary at least twice a day. We simply do not have the manpower to let a doctor check every patient twice a day, even if we have just 50 such cases in a district. Also, the progression of the disease is sudden and might require immediate medical attention. In such cases, we cannot wait for the person to call us and then wait for an ambulance to bring her to a hospital,” a district health official said.During the isolation, the patients must wear a triple-layer mask at all times and discard it after eight hours of use or when visibly dirty or moist. The mask has to be disinfected using 1% hypochlorite solution. The caregiver also has to wear a triple-layer mask when in the same room as the patient and use disposable gloves when handling the patient.They must avoid contact with contaminated items such as cigarettes, eating utensils, dishes, drinks, used towel and bed linen, the guidelines say. The caregiver also have to take the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine – 400 mg twice a day on Day 1 followed by one tablet every week for three weeks. The drug is not recommended for anyone under the age of 15, anyone with retinopathy, cardiac conditions, or know hypersensitivity to hydroxychloroquine and aminoquinoline. In case there are side effects, the caregiver has to report to pharma covigilance.Once home isolation ends, the person will still be under surveillance for another 14 days, and they are not to attend any gathering, according to the guidelines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-govt-notifies-home-isolation-guidelines-for-mild-cases-of-covid-19/story-w01Yyfzjfnr5wMXcBEkrOJ.html
01-05-2020||Gurugram||Residents look to ward off virus with orange-tinted immunity||The sale of oranges in the city has increased by at least 66% in March and April this year, as compared to the same period last year, according to the Haryana State Agricultural Market Board (HSAMB), as people are seeking to build immunity by consuming the fruit rich in vitamin C, said officials.As per the HSAMB data, between March 1 and April 27 this year, a total of 11,222 quintals had been sold at the wholesale Khandsa market, the city’s only wholesale fruits and vegetable market. In comparison, 6,745 quintals of oranges were sold from March 1 to April 30 last year.Incidentally, 6,433 quintals of oranges have been sold between April 1 and April 27 this month.Fruit vendors and HSAMB officials attributed the spike in sales of oranges to the Covid-19 outbreak. “We have had a lot of customers buying 10-15 kilograms of oranges at a go, as opposed to the two to three kilograms people usually buy. Many say they have started purchasing in bulk to increase their vitamin C levels. We have had to increase our orders from distributors across Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh to meet the growing demand,” said Arvind Yadav, a fruit and vegetable wholesaler at the Khandsa market in Sector 10A.According to HSAMB officials, almost 70% of the orange supply to Gurugram is from Maharashtra, 20% from Madhya Pradesh and around 10% from Punjab. The sale of oranges is highest from December-March, after which the sale starts dipping due to higher temperatures.“This year, the demand for oranges has been unprecedented, as people are looking to boost their vitamin C intake. There has been no issue in regard to transportation of fruits from across India and we will continue to ensure it remains that way to meet the growing demand,” said Vinay Yadav, secretary, HSAMB.While the price of oranges in both March 2019 and March this year was the same — ₹2,500-6,000 per quintal — it has become cheaper this April, a drop from ₹5,000-10,000 per quintal in 2019 to ₹3,500-7,500 this year.“If you look at the prices of oranges in March 2020 and March 2019, there is no difference in the rate despite the increase in demand this year. The main reason the prices of vegetables and fruits, in general, have come down this month is due to the fact that people have stopped purchasing items from farmers directly amid the national lockdown. Instead, the farmers have had to sell their goods to a limited number of retailers and wholesalers, which has led to a major drop in prices of all fruits and vegetables,” an HSAMB official privy to the matter said.However, this dip in price has not translated to the retail buyers. Residents said that local grocery stores and roadside vendors are selling oranges at ₹150-200 per kilogram, up from ₹80 earlier.“I had jaundice recently and my immunity is weak, that’s why I have been purchasing oranges in bulk to ensure I am healthy enough to fight off another possible infection. There has been a huge demand for oranges in my society and the roadside vendor has been taking full advantage of it by pricing it at ₹150-200 per kilogram. With my immunocompromised health, I did not want to risk venturing outside due to the fear of contracting Covid-19 and have been forced to buy oranges at such exorbitant rates,” said Anil Chugh, a resident of Sector 50.Health experts said that oranges alone cannot build a strong immune system and a diverse diet with exercise is needed to stay in good health.“While it is well established that vitamin C, which can be derived from oranges, has immune-modulating properties and is a potent anti-oxidant, it alone cannot build immunity overnight. The key to having good health and to fight infectious diseases, including respiratory tract infections, are to include diet diversity such as immune-boosting nutrients like vitamins A, D, zinc, selenium, iron and folic acid, besides vitamin C. Adequate amount of protein in the diet is also vital for a person to enhance their immunity,” said Sandhya Pandey, chief clinical nutritionist, Fortis Memorial Research Institute, Gurugram.Pandey said that a balance of various food groups, such as whole grains, cereals, pulses, legumes, variety of seasonal fruits and vegetables, nuts and seeds, milk and milk products, lean meat and fish, along with engaging in physical activity and high-hydration levels, are needed to stay healthy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/residents-look-to-ward-off-virus-with-orange-tinted-immunity/story-cZGeI33dicesb0Xu0YErXO.html

Samples of others staying in the house have been taken for testing and the family has been asked to quarantine.While the police said that they are yet to ascertain the reason for the act, the man’s relatives alleged that he was stressed due to his wife having tested Covid-19 positive.According to the police, the man used to work with the servicing department of an automobile company in the city, while the woman was a homemaker. She is currently undergoing treatment at a hospital in Sector 9.A relative of the family who stays at the residence, requesting anonymity, said that samples of 10 people living in the house were collected by the authorities for testing on Thursday.This the first positive case of coronavirus in Sector 12. The area is not listed as one of the 24 containment zones, but the police have put up barricades on both sides of the lane leading to the residence.The relative said, “A week ago, his wife had an upset stomach and was admitted to a nearby hospital. She was later told to get tested for the coronavirus disease and shifted to another hospital in Sector 9. On Wednesday night, the husband was informed that she had tested positive for the disease. He then returned home and went into his room. He was worried about her and did not talk to us.”The relative said the man was found hanging from a ceiling fan around 7am on Thursday.The man’s son, who works at the pharmacy of a private hospital in Palam Vihar, said, “I had left for the night shift around 11pm. He seemed fine at that time. When I returned from work the next morning, I got to know that he had hanged himself.”“I do not know how the woman contracted the coronavirus. Her daughter-in-law (a nurse at a Sector 38 hospital) was not going to work. Although her son has been going to the pharmacy, he has not shown any symptom,” said the family member, while waiting outside the house on Thursday afternoon for authorities to send someone for disinfecting the premises.A team from Sector 14 police station was sent to the spot after they received the information, said officials.Subhash Boken, spokesperson, city police, “We are yet to confirm if the deceased’s wife tested positive for coronavirus. We still do not know the exact reason behind the incident. The police officials were fully equipped with personal protective equipment (PPE) kits and went to the spot to collect the body. We are investigating the matter.” Police have initiated inquest proceedings under Section 174 of the code of criminal procedure (CrPC).A neighbour, requesting anonymity, said, “We got to know about the incident when the police came to his house around 8am. It was only then that we were informed about the woman having tested positive.”According to the health department, a post-mortem examination will be conducted on Friday, after testing whether the man had been infected.Dr Jaswant Singh Punia, chief medical officer, said, “The team has taken swabs from the nose and throat of the body, which has been sent to PGIMS Rohtak for testing. On Friday, we will get the results which would help us in contact tracing and investigating how the woman contracted coronavirus.”“We have been sending samples from bodies for RT-PCR testing to confirm whether the person had been infected with the virus. But none of these samples sent so far has tested positive.”(with inputs from Archana Mishra)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/man-hangs-to-death-after-wife-tests-positive-family-of-10-being-tested/story-sVi5nArAKIJCR9JViiWuZO.html
01-05-2020||Gurugram||20 lakh litres of sanitiser found in drums and buckets at a Pataudi house||Acting on a tip-off, the drug control department in a joint raid with the police on Wednesday raided a hand sanitiser manufacturing unit in Pataudi, which was allegedly running without a drug manufacturing license and arrested two persons from the spot. The team recovered one lakh bottles of 500ml capacity each filled with the sanitiser. The label on the product said it was alcohol hand rub, killed viruses, and was made of 70% or more alcohol-based formula.The team allegedly recovered 20,000 such labels and 20 lakh litres of sanitiser stored in several drums and buckets. The factory was operating out of a house in Pataudi area.As per the report prepared by the department, hand sanitiser was filled in the bottles from the buckets and drums with taps. No machines were being used. The house was constructed over 500 square yards and was double-storeyed, comprising six big rooms on two floors, the police said.Amid the coronavirus pandemic, the food and drugs control department has launched an operation to check places manufacturing illegal hand sanitiser and masks, which are being sold on the black market across the district, officials said.Amandeep Chauhan, drug control officer, said that he formed a team of officials from the department and the police after receiving information on Wednesday around 2pm. “We raided the house and found several drums and buckets of hand sanitiser. When we asked the owner to produce the requisite documents, he could not do so. They were manufacturing without a valid license,” he said.The officials said when the teams asked the owners to produce the purchase records of the raw material used for manufacturing hand sanitiser, they produced fake certificates that had allegedly been bought for ₹40,000 from Delhi.Chauhan said since the demand for alcohol-based hand sanitiser has increased due to the Covid-19 outbreak, several illicit manufacturing units have mushroomed across the state. “They have already sold hand sanitiser worth ₹35 lakh in the last one month in Manesar industrial areas, and Bawal and Rewari markets before the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) authorities were tipped off and raided the unit,” he added.According to the police, the directors of the company are Class 12 graduates and started manufacturing sanitiser to make a quick buck during the Covid-19 pandemic.Muhammad Akil, the commissioner of police, said that a team from the Sector 40 police station raided the house on Wednesday afternoon and found a copy of a CE Certificate, WHO GMP Certificate, and ISO and test reports for the hand sanitiser issued by a research laboratory located in DLF Phase 2. When the officials checked the certificates and confirmed with the authorities, they found them to be fake. “During the search, it was found that they manufactured the hand sanitiser by mixing ingredients in a silver container, which is generally used as a cooking utensil, and using a motor fixed with paddles,” he said.The police said the house was in a bad condition: flies and mosquito-like insects were in abundance. The manufacturers allegedly did not take measures to avoid the risk of contamination from the environment, open sewage, drains and a public lavatory.The manufacturers did not disclose the source of water or produce a water test report. There was water stored in tanks, which may have adversely affected its quality. The water tank was not cleaned and there was visible sand in the water, the police said.“The environment of the manufacturing premises was very filthy and unhygienic, which may have contaminated the sanitiser with filth and rendered it injurious to health. This was evident from the storage area where alcohol drums were stored adjoining to the washroom which was in an unhygienic condition,” Akil said.A case under sections 471 (using forged documents), 467 (Forgery of valuable security), 468 (Forgery for purpose of cheating), 420 (cheating), 34 (common intention), 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 120 B (conspiracy), Sections 51 of disaster management act, 2005 and sections 27(D), 27 (B) and 27 A of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940, was registered at the Pataudi police station on Wednesday night.Amit Khatri, deputy commissioner of Gurugram, said that they have formed teams to check if factories manufacturing masks and hand sanitiser are involved in black marketing. “Strict action will be taken against those found involved in any illegal trade during ongoing lockdown,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/20-lakh-litres-of-sanitiser-found-in-drums-and-buckets-at-a-pataudi-house/story-Yviq46ZgPgsilaIpTLa7NL.html
01-05-2020||Delhi||Health centres directed to remain open, beds added at private hospitals for Covid patients||The Delhi government has directed all clinics, hospitals and nursing homes, including private ones, to remain open for the treatment of non-Covid patients. The hospitals have been threatened with cancellation of licence for not complying with the order.“Non-compliance will be viewed seriously and action as per provisions of law, including cancellation of registration of the defaulter hospitals and nursing homes will be initiated without further notice,” the order stated.Hospitals have been asked not to refuse treatment to anyone, other than suspected Covid-19 patients, and ensure essential services like delivery of children, haemodialysis, blood transfusion, chemotherapy, treatment of chronic as well as communicable diseases, such as TB and leprosy.“Several clinics and nursing homes started opening up and scaling up their services after April 20. However, we need to ensure that while people receive treatment, healthcare workers do not get infected. The government should provide masks and PPE kits to private clinics and small nursing homes as they are already in a lot of financial trouble because of the lockdown and this burden should not be added. Also, there should be aggressive testing to detect the asymptomatic carriers so that the chances of unknowingly getting exposed are reduced,” said Dr Girish Tyagi, president, Delhi Medical Association.“Plus, the government has to sort out the border closure issues and ensure public transport for healthcare workers to ensure that the clinics remain open,” he said.For the treatment of Covid-19 patients, Delhi government has started two more paid isolation facilities at private hospitals in the city, adding 220 beds for Covid-19 patients — 120-bed Sir Ganga Ram City Hospital on Pusa Road and 100 at the Maha Durga Charitable Trust in Model Town — taking the total to 412.Those testing positive for the virus can opt to stay at these hospitals and pay the hospitals directly.Until now, Indraprastha Apollo hospital, Sir Ganga Ram Kolmet and Max Super Speciality hospital in Saket were the designated private hospitals for treating Covid-19 patients.“In view of the shortage of isolation beds at private hospitals, following private hospitals are also declared as Covid hospitals for admitting confirmed or suspected cases of Covid-19,” the Delhi government order read.“Two of the hospitals — with 162 beds in total — affiliated with Sir Ganga Ram will now treat Covid-19 patients. The main hospital in Rajinder Nagar will remain for the treatment of non-Covid-19 patients only,” the hospital said.Two dedicated Delhi government hospitals for the treatment of Covid-19 patients — Lok Nayak and Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality — have 2,500 beds in total for Covid-19 patients. There are at least 500 beds for Covid-19 patients in the four Central government-run hospitals — AIIMS, Safdarjung Hospital, RML Hospital, and Lady Hardinge Medical College.The government has also directed Lok Nayak Hospital to run its dialysis centre all hours throughout the week, to provide services to kidney disease patients who also have Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/health-centres-directed-to-remain-open-beds-added-at-private-hospitals-for-covid-patients/story-giUE9UeKvEkvzPAP8XPJwN.html
01-05-2020||Delhi||Another nurse tests Covid positive at Hindu Rao Hospital||A second nurse working at North Delhi Municipal Corporation’s Hindu Rao Hospital in Malka Ganj tested positive for Covid-19 on Thursday.In Thursday’s case, the nurse was tested as part of a group of 76 healthcare workers — including doctors and ward staff — who had come in close contact with another nurse who tested Covid positive last Saturday. The 980-bedded super specialty hospital had to be closed for a day after this.“We have received test reports of 34 of these 76 healthcare workers so far. All have tested negative except for this one nurse, who was a primary contact with the nurse who tested positive last Saturday.. She was sent on quarantine from Monday immediately after her sample was taken,” \north body spokesperson, Ira Singhal, said.Doctors have alleged negligence in the case of this nurse saying she had already reported high fever to the hospital authorities a week before her test results came positive, but was still asked to report for duty daily. The north corporation later said it had launched an enquiry in the matter.In the case of a young gynaecologist, who tested Covid-positive at the corporation’s Kasturba Hospital on Wednesday, similar allegations were made. This hospital is near Jama Masjid. A doctor working with the hospital, who didn’t wish to be named, said, “It was extremely negligent on the part of the department head. The gynae who tested positive had come to the hospital five days before she tested positive. She was running a high fever and her condition was so bad that she was unable to move and had to sleep in the delivery room.”“She was asked to go home later, but not tested for Covid immediately. Isn’t it the administration’s duty to get healthcare workers checked if they are unwell? She was tested only once she came back to duty but still had some symptoms. In the meantime, other doctors kept visiting her room routinely,” he said.Singhal said no doctor had come forth to them and reported such a lapse. “No such thing has come to our notice. If anyone has any specific issue, they need to tell us and we will resolve it. Sanitization is anyway being done there thrice in a day.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/another-nurse-tests-covid-positive-at-hindu-rao-hospital/story-QxVUhoW2AXXqniitncCQJJ.html
01-05-2020||Delhi||Delhi police appeal to stranded migrants, students, tourists to stay where they are||A day after the Union home ministry issued fresh guidelines, allowing stranded migrant workers, students and tourist to return home, Delhi Police on Thursday appealed to such people to “stay wherever they were until modalities for implementation of the guidelines are framed.”Delhi Police commissioner SN Shrivastava said that the home ministry in its order has issued certain instructions to the states and union territories — which included developing standard protocols for receiving and sending stranded people.“We are in the process of framing the modalities to ensure that transportation of such people is done in a planned and phase-wise manner. Till then, I appeal to migrant workers, students and tourists stranded in Delhi to maintain peace, stay wherever they are and wait for our updates,” said the police chief.Many senior police officer said that police presence and patrolling has been intensified on streets and in areas where migrants are living in order to avoid a rerun of the last month’s situation. Last month, immediately after the lockdown was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to contain the spread of Covid-19, a sea of migrants had gathered outside Anand Vihar bus terminal to return home following rumours that buses were being arranged for them.“Inputs have started coming in that some people are misguiding stranded migrants and offering them help to return home in lieu of money. We have identified a few of them and their activities are under watch,” said joint commissioner of police (southern range) Devesh Chandra Srivastava.Anticipating that the stranded people may reach the three interstate bus terminals — from where government and private interstate buses operate — these places have been sealed and no buses are parked there.“Apart from the main roads, adequate deployment of police personnel has been done on other alternate routes, such as railway tracks through which migrants can reach the bus terminals,” said Jasmeet Singh, deputy commissioner of police (east).Between March 27 and 29, thousands of migrants had gathered in and around Anand Vihar bus terminal near Delhi-Ghaziabad border after rumours spread that they will be sent back home, despite the lockdown. Since the crowd continued swelling at an alarming rate, the government arranged buses and sent many such migrants home. Those left were later shifted to various shelter homes and camps. All station house officers (SHOs) and beat officers have been asked to regularly meet the stranded migrants and keep updating them about the steps the city police was taking to implement the home ministry’s fresh guidelines. They have also been instructed to deliver cooked food and essential items to migrants, who are jobless because of the lockdown.“We are trying to keep them free from stress and boredom by introducing them to different sports and other recreational activities,” said DCP (south) Atul Kumar Thakur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-police-appeal-to-stranded-migrants-students-tourists-to-stay-where-they-are/story-uMXsOWYkrqIQkcbt3Nmj4M.html
01-05-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt readies to send workers home, bring back students||The Delhi government will bring back over 750 students stranded from Kota in Rajasthan, senior government officials said on Thursday. The government will also introduce an online application system to help thousands of migrant workers in the city to return to their native states.While a timeline is yet to be finalised, the buses are expected to leave for Kota, around 520 kms away, in a day or two, an official said.This came a day after the Union home ministry issued guidelines for state governments to enable the return of migrants, students and pilgrims, in buses. These people are stranded due to the ongoing lockdown that was started on March 25 and extended till May 3, to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease Covid-19.Soon after the guidelines were issued, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday had said that his government will come up with a detailed plan later this week and urged migrant workers in the city to stay indoor till then.On Thursday, Kejriwal announced that his government is making arrangements to bring Delhi students back home from Kota, a hub of coaching centres for engineering and medical aspirants from across the country. “The transport department has been directed to arrange 30 private buses. Each bus will seat around 25 students only owing to social distancing norms. We are trying our best to send the buses by tomorrow so that the students can reach Delhi by Saturday. We will bring back 750-800 students. Besides, we can also arrange for a second batch of buses, in case the Kota administration informs that there are more Delhi students stranded there,” said a second senior official on condition of anonymity.With regard to transporting people stuck in the lockdown, most requests to the Delhi government were from those wishing to leave for their home state elsewhere.“So far, we have received only a few requests to bring people back to Delhi. These are mostly pilgrims, family members or students. Majority are of those who want to go to other states such as UP, Bihar, Haryana, West Bengal and so on,” said a third senior government official.This point was also highlighted by Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain on Thursday. “We are initiating talks with different states who want to take their people back from Delhi. I want to make it clear that it will be the concerned state’s responsibility to send buses to Delhi and take them home safely. Delhi government, on its part, will conduct thorough medical screening of all those who leave the city and hand over their records to the concerned state government,” Jain said.A senior government official said that the government has sought appointment for video conference with the Centre as well as with other states.Be it students, parents or migrant workers, everyone who will be transported from one state to the other will not just have to undergo medical screening, but will also have to mandatorily home quarantine themselves for 14 days upon reaching their home state, a senior official said. Only people who do not have symptoms of Covid-19 would be allowed to travel.The Delhi government is planning to set up a system under which migrant workers and others can apply for special passes either online, through a weblink which the government is working on, or by calling the integrated helpline 1031, which was, so far, receiving distress calls related to food distribution, ration, compensation for auto drivers and construction workers and those related to Covid-19 related medical emergencies.“The idea is to prepare an application system so that people can be sent back systematically and the city does not have to witness a repeat of the Anand Vihar situation. The proposed system aims at ensuring people are given dates, time slots, bus details and facility to travel to the concerned boarding point,” said the official.A day after the nationwide lockdown was announced on March 24, thousands of migrant workers flocked to the Anand Vihar interstate bus terminal at the Delhi-UP border hoping to get a ride to their respective native states. A day later, the Delhi government was forced to help them with buses connecting them to borders of neighbouring states and some specific destinations for another day until the lockdown could be properly imposed. Kejriwal had then urged the remaining migrant workers to stay back ensuring them shelter and regular meals.Currently, over 20,000 migrants are staying in 328 shelter homes across the city. More than 1 million people, comprising a large chunk of migrant workers, avail free meals distributed by the government, officials said.Groups of trade unions in the city peg the total number of migrant workers employed in the unorganised sector at around 1.5 million – with the largest chunk employed in the construction sector.The demand for such a scheme increased after states such as UP, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Bihar coordinated among themselves to facilitate interstate travel of students and pilgrims caught in the lockdown.(ends)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-govt-readies-to-send-workers-home-bring-back-students/story-ESFdH1oOH1GFa0sGkQ7LcO.html

01-05-2020||Gurugram||After Faridabad, cross-border movement between Delhi, Gurugram now suspended||Cross-border movement between the national Capital and Gurugram will be stopped from 10am on Friday, with a few exemptions to maintain the supply of essential items, according to an order issued by the Gurugram administration on Thursday. On Wednesday, Faridabad had cross-border movement while the Gautam Budh Nagar and Ghaziabad in Uttar Pradesh sealed borders last week.Deputy commissioner of Gurugram, Amit Khatri, in his order, asked government and private organisations in Gurugram and Delhi to make lodging arrangements for their employees, including essential staff such as health and sanitation workers, to avoid any undue hardship.Officials said that rapid antibody testing of suspected cases will be done at the Delhi-Gurugram borders, besides thermal scanning. Drivers and helpers undertaking cross-border movement will have to remain in isolation at dedicated facilities, on their return to Gurugram. Those moving across borders have been asked to install the Aarogya Setu application on their mobile phones for contact tracing and monitoring their locations.Residents of the two cities who have been travelling between the borders daily for work will now have to stay in the respective cities they are working in. The decision has been taken after Covid-19 cases reported in Gurugram were traced to the Capital. Till Friday, 57 Covid-19 cases were reported in Gurugram.“We have given time for people to make appropriate arrangements before the movement is curbed from Friday,” said VS Kundu, chief executive officer of the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA), who is also the Covid-19 in-charge for Gurugram.The decision to close Delhi-Gurugram borders was announced four days after Haryana home minister Anil Vij called for sealing of the state’s border with Delhi, where 3,515 cases of Covid-19 have been reported so far.Chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Wednesday, in an address to the citizens, said that the number of infected persons in Delhi is rapidly increasing. “We will not allow coronavirus from Delhi to enter Haryana. In the last six days, 28 coronavirus cases have been reported in Gurugram, Faridabad, Sonepat and Jhajjar where contact sources were traced to Delhi. We have taken the decision to strictly curb movement across the border. The supply of essential items will be ensured, allowing only a driver and single support staff to cross borders,” said Khattar.The administration has allowed vehicles ferrying vegetables, fruits, grains, poultry and other eatables, fodder for animals, medicines, medical equipment and raw materials used in manufacturing protective gear, sanitisers and ventilators to cross the border. The vehicles can have only one support staff, besides the driver.Ambulances, ATM cash vans, LPG and oil containers/tankers will be allowed to move. Those who have been issued restricted movement pass by Central and state governments will also be allowed to cross the borders, as per the order. This includes the staff of Prime Minister’s Office, Union ministry of home, finance and defence, postal department, disaster management and early-warning agencies, National Informatics Centres and Food Corporation of India.To ensure inter-state and inter-district supply chain is not affected, the movement of vehicles carrying essential and non-essential items will be allowed to cross the national and state highways. However, these vehicles will not be allowed to halt in Gurugram. For the movement for any other vehicles, except those exempted, permission has to be sought from the deputy commissioner’s office.Khatri has deployed 30 duty magistrates at police posts located at the state and district borders. Ten other duty magistrates will be on standby.Mohammad Akil, the commissioner of police, Gurugram, said, “An assistant commissioner of police and station house officers of the area will personally monitor the border for at least eight hours. Deputy commissioners of police will check the surveillance and submit reports on the vehicular movements, every day.”Meanwhile, inter-district movement to and from Faridabad and Nuh, with valid permissions, has been allowed.Faridabad also sealed its five entry and exit points connecting Delhi on Wednesday, except vehicles transporting essential items, and directed staff working in Delhi to make temporary accommodation arrangements. Prohibitory orders, under Section 144 of the CrPC were imposed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/after-faridabad-cross-border-movement-between-delhi-gurugram-now-suspended/story-gYrGDshOqCvhQUh1SlI5WM.html
01-05-2020||Delhi||Delhi chronicler who wrote on streets, ruins and its people, dies||RV Smith, the Delhi chronicler who produced stories from the city’s gallis, kuchas, bazars, ruins, dargahs and graveyards as lightly as a magician brought out pigeons from a hat, died on Thursday morning. He was 83. He is survived by wife, 82-year-old Alvina, and five children.“He was ill for some time,” said his eldest daughter 51-year-old Enid, adding that he died at around 7.30am at his second-floor flat in Mayapuri.Ronald Vivian Smith, Ronnie to friends, began his career as a reporter for The Statesman where he worked for more than 30 years and went on to author scores of books on the city. He was also wrote a column for the paper (“Quaint Corner”) and also for The Hindu (“Down memory lane”) on the city and its people.“I feel no amount of bookish knowledge can compete with the sort of insights and real, lived memories Smith sahab had,” said author Rakhshanda Jalil who often hosted Smith at her house for tea and sandwiches. “He had a fund of qissa-kahanis (anecdotes) about Delhi, and he always told his stories with an anecdote, a laugh and a twinkle in his eye.”Admirers who flocked to meet Smith at his apartment would at first be boggled by the massive pile of yellowing newspaper cuttings, containing the thousands of offbeat stories he had written on the Capital. Those papers would be stacked up haphazardly on the metal shelves of his drawing room that also served as his study. Smith would point them out as valuable documents of his life and work. They also remain an important archive of modern-day Delhi, but the frail elderly man was too modest to point that out.Smith’s first story, he once told this writer, was on a painting he saw hanging inside the historic St James’ Church in Kashmere Gate.He would go on to author 12 books on the city, including a novel and two volumes of poems. Some of his acclaimed titles are The Delhi That No-One Knows, Tales The Monuments Tell and Capital Vignettes.One of his last books, published in 2014, was Delhi Rambles: Quaint Cityscape Through A Roving Eye. It was a collection of his more recent newspaper columns. In the foreword, author Pran Nevile wondered if Smith was “inspired by the Muraqqa-e-Delhi by Dargah Quli Khan, who penned a fascinating account of Delhi’s social and cultural life in the 18th century.”Unlike most writers these days, Smith shunned the laptop. He typed his column on his late father’s Underwood typewriter before walking down to a nearby cyber café, where he would get it typed on Microsoft Word by a café attendant for ₹20 per page. While modern-day reporters can’t function without online search engines, Smith’s stories came straight from his personal encounters on the street. “I keep my eyes and ears open wherever I happen to be, for I always write what I have personally experienced,” he used to say. “Writing to me is recalling incidents and bazaar scenes, or things noticed in the surroundings of old monuments.”With titles as atmospheric as “Killer Tree In The Red Fort”, “Durga Puja In The 1950s” and “Loneliness & Street Cries”, the crisply written chapters in Smith’s various books were like a flying carpet that take the reader into a city only he has seen.Unlike other celebrated writers on Delhi, he remained as invisible as the people and places he wrote about. He was rarely spotted at book launches. In the Sunday service at Mayapuri’s St. John De Britto Church, he would always be seen sitting quietly in the last row.Like many Delhiwallas, Smith was not born in Delhi. Raised in an Anglo-Indian household in Agra, he was a descendant of an adopted daughter of a British adventurer called Salvadore Smith, who was drafted into a Maharaja’s army in the 18th century. The next generations opted for less uncertain professions. Smith’s father was the Agra correspondent for a number of national dailies. It was through “Papa’s letter” that he was appointed in 1964 as a sub-editor/reporter at The Statesman in Delhi.For many years Smith had no permanent home in the city. He lived in cheap hotels that surround the Jama Masjid to this day. This semi-nomadic existence enabled him to explore the Walled City like an insider: his archetypal street-side stories are the stuff that today’s flâneurs dream of.“First, I moved to Naaz Hotel, where I stayed in the room that was earlier occupied by (painter) M F Husain when he lived in Old Delhi,” Smith said in one of his many interviews with this author in recent years. “I later shifted with my wife to Azad Hind Hotel, where my son Tony was born. We ate most of our meals at Karim’s. In the evenings, we sat on Jama Masjid’s stairs, where we would have seekh kebabs.”One wonders what will be the fate of the newspaper clippings of his writings that he so assiduously collected in his study. Also, what about the scores of black-and-white family photos and letters he preserved? This accumulation is a rare window not only into an Anglo-Indian world of Saturday night dances and Tambola rounds in Agra’s Postal Telegraph Club, but also into the life of a Delhi writer who has chronicled those aspects of the city that otherwise would have passed unrecorded.“Smith sahab had a hard life towards the end of his years; some of that hardship could have been alleviated if there were some help from a government agency none of which was forthcoming. I know this because I tried,” remarks Jalil.One of the souvenirs in Smith’s archive was a press ID card issued to him by The Statesman in the 1970s that specifically mentioned that “his work involves attendance at night.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-chronicler-who-wrote-on-streets-ruins-and-its-people-dies/story-qGH39pSkPHli2Bvk7mFcwJ.html
01-05-2020||Chandigarh||Safety of health workers proving Herculean task for Chandigarh admn||Protecting health workers from getting infected and spreading Covid-19 is proving to be a challenge for the Chandigarh administration. So far, 16 health workers in the city have got infected, of which two have infected over 30 others, including 24 in Bapu Dham Colony.Of the 16, six are from Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), one from a private health institute and nine from the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) in Sector 32.Over 450 persons, who have come in contact with these health workers, have been quarantined in Chandigarh. These do not include the health workers residing on GMCH premises.INFECTION TRAILS On April 24, one of the health workers from GMCH-32, a 30-year-old resident of Bapu Dham Colony, became a “super spreader” for the colony, wherein 24 more have been found positive (two more in Manimajra and Sector 52) and 190 persons have been put under home quarantine.After his reports, eight other staffers of GMCH, including three doctors, have been tested positive so far. None of them was dealing with a positive case, and majority were either posted in emergency or in operation theatre.In another instance, a 30-year-old hospital attendant posted in communicable disease ward at the PGIMER got infected on April 17. The next day, the entire family of the man, who reside in a one-room apartment in Nayagaon, got infected.‘MINIMISING RISK’In a meeting with the UT administrator on Thursday, health secretary Dr Arun Kumar Gupta said adequate facilities were being provided to the doctors and health staff.Meanwhile, GMCH director principal Dr BS Chavan said, “We have started providing PPE kits to doctors and other staff in the emergency to ensure their safety. We are going to start testing for Covid before performing any surgery.

01-05-2020||Noida||UP industry minister assures help for Noida’s realty sector||The Uttar Pradesh industry minister Satish Mahana has assured developers that the state government will address the crisis in the real estate sector in Noida, Greater Noida and Yamuna Expressway areas due to the nationwide lockdown in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. Mahana interacted with developers through video-conferencing to discuss issues that cropped up after construction sites were shut down due to the lockdown. Several developers from the National Real Estate Development Council (NAREDCO) and the Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (Credai), two builders’ associations, participated in the webinar that took place on Wednesday evening. Alok Tandon, industrial and infrastructure development commissioner, Uttar Pradesh government, also participated in the webinar that was organised to discuss various issues facing the real estate sector.The developers’ demands include mortgaging unsold stock (ready flats), the reduction of interest on project loans, waivers of interest on land cost dues if civic amenities are delayed, a waiver on time-extension charges, financial dues de-linked from occupancy certificate issuance, the postponement of financial dues on housing projects, a waiver in stamp duty for one year, the reduction of prevailing impractical circle rates (property cost at which flats or plots are sold) to boost sales, and a waiver on electricity charges for builders during the lockdown period, among others.“We have noted all demands raised by the developers. Now the state government will take appropriate decisions on all important demands to give the real estate sector a boost. The state government is taking required steps to address the issues that have arisen due to the lockdown,” Mahana said.Developers said that the state government should take immediate decisions if they want the sector to be revived. There are at least 600 ongoing housing projects in Noida, Greater Noida and the Yamuna Expressway areas said the UP real estate regulatory authority. And at least one lakh homebuyers’ investments in these projects are at stake. As per NAREDCO, there are at least 5 lakh skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled workers employed to work on different projects in Noida, Greater Noida and Yamuna Expressway areas. And at least 2 lakh employees have been employed by 200 developers, who are operating from Noida, Greater Noida and Yamuna Expressway areas. “We need the state government to make quick decisions so that we can survive. If the state government accepts our demands, then it will help at least 2 lakh employees working on real estate projects and 1 lakh homebuyers earn their livelihoods without hassles. If these issues are not resolved then the sector will witness an unprecedented deadlock due to the lockdown given the Covid-19 pandemic,” RK Arora, president of the Uttar Pradesh chapter of NAREDCO, said.Builders from across the state participated in this webinar.“There are at least 5 lakh skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled workers employed to work on different real estate sites. If the issues of this sector are not resolved then it will worsen the economic crisis. But we hope that government will look into our demands,” Prashant Tiwari, president of the western UP chapter of Credai, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/up-industry-minister-assures-help-for-noida-s-realty-sector/story-iFvn6NQzaFtMTh0OZd4Y9H.html

01-05-2020||Noida||Noida: 110 people arrested daily for violation of lockdown rules||The Gautam Budh Nagar police, data showed, have arrested at least 110 people daily on an average for violating prohibitory orders ever since the lockdown was imposed .Prime Minister Narendra Modi had called for a three-week nationwide lockdown from March 25 to check the spread of Covid-19. The lockdown was later extended till May 3. However, the Uttar Pradesh government had already announced a three-day lockdown from March 23.The UP government has also mandated the use of face masks in public places and cops have been booking anyone who is caught without a mask.According to official data, from March 23 to April 30 (till 7pm), a total of 4,894 people had been booked under Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the Indian Penal Code.

01-05-2020||City||Ludhiana industrialists urge Punjab govt to allow operations in mixed land-use area||With the state government announcing relaxations for industries situated in rural areas, industrial estates and focal points; members of Federation of Industrial and Commercial Organisation (FICO) and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have demanded that the industrialists be allowed to operate the units situated in mixed land use areas.The industry representatives said that most of these units are situated inside the houses and the large-scale industries depend on these micro and small units. “The owners of these units work as vendors for the large-scale industries. The small industries in the mixed land use areas are paid to modify the products sent to them,” they said.FICO president Gurmeet Kular said, “The government should permit operations in mix land use areas from May 3. Thousands of units are situated there, ranging in size from 50sq yards to 100sq yards. Only a few labourers work in these units, so it is will be easy to follow the social distancing norms. Also, the large-scale industries cannot work until the small and micro units start their operations.”BJP district vice-president Rajnish Dhiman said, “These industries should be allowed to operate from 7am to 11am, as they are reeling under losses. Almost 50% of Ludhiana’s industries are situated in mixed land use areas and by allowing them to operate, the economy can be brought back on track. Further, the government should also look into the problems being faced by the industry due to shortage of labour.”Earlier, Janta Nagar Small Scale Manufacturers Association (JNSSMA) president Jaswinder Thukral had submitted a memorandum with deputy commissioner Pradeep Agrawal and cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu. FICO DEMANDS RELEASE OF PENDING VAT AND SGST REFUNDSDemanding the release of pending value added tax (VAT) and state goods and service tax (SGST) refunds, FICO members conducted a meeting on Thursday with Punjab excise and taxation commissioner Vivek Pratap Singh and additional excise and taxation commissioner Ravneet Singh Khurana through a video conference. They demanded that the state government should waive the penalty/surcharge on the delayed payment of GST instalment which was deferred till June, 2020.The industry is demanding its own money and no extra subsidy, but the government has failed to release the pending refunds.Kular said, “The state government failed to release the VAT refunds, which have been pending even before the GST regime, which was introduced in 2017. Further, the SGST returns of hundreds of crores are also pending due to which the industry is facing shortage of working capital. The industry is reeling under losses and imposition of interest on bank loans has further worsened the crises.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-industrialists-urge-punjab-govt-to-allow-operations-in-mix-land-use-area/story-4rhO9i5uKaiJcMefIJ22fO.html
01-05-2020||Chandigarh||After Bapu Dham Colony, Sector 30 emerges as second biggest Covid hotspot in Chandigarh with 16 cases||After Bapu Dham Colony, Sector 30 has emerged as the second major Covid cluster in Chandigarh, accounting for nearly one-fifth (16) of the total 74 cases to date.Nine cases, including the two that came to light on Wednesday night, have been reported here in the last four days. What makes authorities worried is the fact that all these cases have emerged in the EWS locality of the sector’s B block that stands entirely sealed now.The locality’s 600 households are home to approximately 4,000 people living in multi-storey 2 marla houses. As many as eight houses between house numbers 1500 and 1680 have already been exposed to the virus.While the test reports of several primary contacts of those found infected are awaited, the source of the spread is not fully known to the authorities. Some administrative officials indicate that the ground situation is akin to community transmission, but it has not been declared officially by the UT health department. The first case reported from Sector 30B on March 28 was that of a Dubai-returned youth, who ended up infecting his mother and two friends living not far from his place.Just when the authorities thought all his contacts had been tracked and screened, a 52-year-old woman — who lives in the lane behind the Dubai-returned youth’s house — came for checkup at the Government Multi-Specialty Hospital (GMSH) in Sector 16 on April 17 after she had developed minor fever and cough. She was found to be Covid positive a day later. She had no travel history.Three out of five of her family members tested positive a day later on April 19. However, no more sampling was done in the area even as 64 of the woman’s secondary contacts were home-quarantined.For the next one week, no case was reported here. But on April 27, two of a family — a 41-year-old man and his 65-year-old mother — were found positive on April 27. Their house is located in front of the 52-year-old woman’s.Five more cases from as many as four houses were found positive the very next day on April 28. This led the authorities to sample 15 of their primary contacts while putting in home-quarantine as many as 100 people. These cases, however, had no primary or secondary contacts with the earlier cases, nor were their locations anywhere nearby their houses.The latest two cases reported on April 29 midnight were contacts of the mother-son duo that had tested positive on April 27.While UT health authorities claimed that these positive cases were the result of their intense screening on ground, Yadvinder Mehta, president of RWA-Block A (Sector 30B), said the screening was still not an effective way of dealing with the threat. “We want aggressive testing in the whole locality as there may be people who are either asymptomatic or have lied about their travel history,” he said.Area councillor Devinder Singh Babla said he had approached the administration for aggressive testing but to no avail. Besides, supply of essentials was erratic and even those who needed immediate medical help like insulin injections had to wait for days. “Police enforcement, too, gets weaker by late evening, giving a chance to the people to come out of their homes,” he added.While UT director health Dr G Dewan did not respond to repeated calls, UT administrator VP Singh Badnore during the daily review meeting on Thursday directed Dr Dewan to send medical teams to conduct intensive and extensive screening and testing in Bapu Dham Colony and Sector 30B, so that no suspected cases are left out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/after-bapu-dham-colony-sector-30-emerges-as-second-biggest-covid-hotspot-in-chandigarh-with-16-cases/story-UjGEanRiOyXqsRb4iRHxpM.html

Within six days, 24 others from the same colony (excluding one from Sector 52 and another from Manimajra, with their source of infection from Bapu Dham Colony) had tested positive and 190 of his contacts quarantined.“Out of 74 Covid-19 positive cases in Chandigarh, the highest number, 25, is from Bapu Dham Colony and 16 from Sector 30. In Bapu Dham, the source of infection is one, the OT attendant from GMCH-32, but we don’t know how he was infected,” said Anil Kumar Garg, additional commissioner, Chandigarh municipal corporation (MC).Then in Sector 30, from where 16 cases have been reported, the source of five persons has not been traced. “One woman with Covid-19 infected five more, but again we don’t know her source. Four more cases whose sources are not known have infected seven more,” said an MC official.Garg said “We do know that the Sector 30 woman had spent six days at GMCH-32. She might have picked up the infection from the hospital, but we are not sure.”Sources of two more patients, a PU teacher and resident of Sector 37 and a woman from Sector 38, have not been traced.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/sources-of-8-covid-19-cases-including-gmch-ot-attendant-from-bapu-dham-still-untraced/story-OSJv91H5hhrW7tCa9ZW01N.html

He was 82.“We’ve lost one of the leading lights of Indian sport today. Not too many can boast of being top-notch in two different sports. You played your part to the fullest, rest well, Chuni sir. Strength to the family,” India captain and record goalscorer Chhetri said in a tweet.Former captain Bhutia, who has played for Mohun Bagan, a club Goswami played for all his life, said Indian football lost two of its biggest icons in Goswami and P.K. Banerjee who passed away last month.“It’s a huge loss. This is a bad period for Indian football. Whenever there is talk about Indian football, you hear names of Chuni Goswami an P.K. Banerjee,” Bhutia told IANS.“I haven’t had a lot of interaction with Chuni da but I did meet him when I was playing for Mohun Bagan. He always had a smile on his face and was a gentleman,” added Bhutia.Goswami’s biggest achievement was captaining India to the 1962 Asian Games Gold medal when India scripted a historic 2-1 victory against South Korea (Korea Republic) in the final to land India its second gold medal in Asian Games history.Goswami was an able all-rounder for the Bengal cricket team, leading them to the Ranji Trophy final in 1971/72.He represented Bengal in 46 matches between 1962 and 1973 and scored 1,592 runs as also taking 47 wickets.“BCCI mourns the death of Subimal ‘Chuni’ Goswami, an all-rounder in the truest sense.

Ludhiana admn starts free counselling||With schools shut and children forced to stay indoors 24/7, most parents are finding it difficult to go about with their everyday routine while also helping children with their studies. To help parents cope with this added stress amid the pandemic, the district bureau of employment and enterprises (DBEE) has started a free counselling facility for parents.Nidhi Singhi, counsellor (PhD in psychology) at the DBEE, said the facility is for the parents having school-aged kids. “Earlier, children used to spend about seven hours everyday in an educational setup. But now they are stuck indoors and it is becoming challenging for the parents to give in to their wards’ special demands throughout the day while working from home,” said Singhi, who has a nine-year-old son.“The parents will also be provided counselling for other interpersonal and mental health problems,” Singhi added.The counsellor said schoolteachers, who have kids of their own, are the most stressed these days. “These days, teachers are online throughout the day as they have to prepare educational videos, assignments and tests for the students. Further, they need to get the homework approved by the heads before sending the same to the students,” she said.“Then these parents also handle students’ queries while doing household chores and helping their own kids with homework. All this has overburdened the parents,” Singhi added.Gurjit Kaur, a city-based pre-school teacher, said her two daughters (aged 10 and 4) are being given more assignments during the lockdown. “I prepare assignments for my students at school and also help my daughters with their homework. Some assignments given to my daughters are tough and require my total assistance in solving them. As I got stressed with managing everything, I hired an online tutor, who is charging ₹700 per subject, for my elder daughter,” Kaur said.Ravinder Kaur, a government schoolteacher, said, “I get calls throughout the day from students who want me to answer their queries. So, I only do the work that needs priority so that I can also help my son with his homework and do the chores,” said Kaur, who has a 13-year-old son.DBEE deputy CEO Navdeep Singh said the counselling facility is available for the parents from Monday to Saturday from 9am to 5pm. “We have started giving sessions on phone on various issues, including handling children during the lockdown, preparing for competitive exams, self-care, time management while in quarantine and dealing with stress. Parents will also be taught thought modification techniques for improving mental health besides career counselling,” Singh said.“Interested individuals can call on 7889194960 to avail this free counselling facility,” Singh added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lockdown-stress-dbee-offers-free-counselling-to-parents-of-school-going-kids/story-Ep6bRH0iFt9mwdkTvEeO5L.html

01-05-2020||City||Farm to fork: Farmer’s distress call turns into direct-selling of produce in Mohali’s housing societies||What began as a response to a distress call made by a kinnow grower in Abohar, looking for a market to sell the fruit amid the curfew, has now turned into a pilot project to aid direct selling of farmers’ produce in different housing societies of the district. The project called “Farm to fork” — an initiative of the residents’ welfare association of Jal Vayu Towers, Kharar, and two horticulture development officers living there — has not only helped around 800 families get a regular supply of fresh fruits and vegetables, but also helped farmers create new markets through direct selling.Under this community supported agriculture (CSA) model, horticultural crops like fruits and vegetables that are perishable in nature are sold at fair rates directly to the consumer. The prices are higher than the mandi rates (wholesale rate) for the farmer and lower for the consumer than the retail rates.The system has been running successfully for three weeks in the Jal Vayu Towers. “Due to the curfew, the supply of kinnow fruit was hindered, so our farmer friend from Abohar called to find out the demand for kinnow in Chandigarh or other nearby mandis. But at the time, the mandis were almost closed, so we thought of setting up an arrangement in our society,” said Yuvraj, horticulture development officer, Nurpur Bedi, Rupnagar.The demand was generated through the society’s WhatsApp groups. “As the farmers of Nurpur Bedi block of Rupnagar were in touch with us, they were persuaded to supply fruits/vegetables. Some farmers joined us and started supplying fresh strawberries, muskmelons, watermelons, brinjals, okra (bhindi), and cauliflower.”“Seven to eight farmers are currently supplying produce in our locality. They are getting profit directly without sharing it with any middleman, and residents are getting fresh produce at a reasonable rate,” said Bharat Bhushan, horticulture development officer, Majra in Mohali.“During the curfew when people are not permitted to step out of their houses, these two employees of Punjab horticulture department have tied up with farmers to bring their produce to the society complex and sell at very reasonable rates,” said Vijay Kumar, vice-president, RWA, Jal Vayu Towers, Kharar.“The rate list as well as prior intimation is given through WhatsApp,” said RS Pannu, retired wing commander and a resident.MODEL TO BE REPLICATEDThe Punjab horticulture department is now looking to replicate the model.Shailender Kaur, director horticulture, said, “A pilot project facilitated the farmers to sell their produce. We are looking at replicating this in different housing societies in Mohali and Kharar.”She added that talks were on with different farmers to encourage them to sell their produce in groups, so that one farmer collected different fruits/vegetables from different farmers and sold them to lower the transportation costs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farm-to-fork-farmer-s-distress-call-turns-into-direct-selling-of-produce-in-mohali-s-housing-societies/story-aov2PiqTpf1JcboPDX3pTK.html

To generate some revenue, the public transport body has put up a proposal to private and semi-private firms, government-run institutions and information technology (IT) companies in areas like Chakan, Hinjewadi, Bhosari, Chinchwad and MIDC to opt for hired buses from the PMPML.At least 1,600 buses are parked on the roads, while only a handful of them ply on the road for essential services staff. “Ever since the lockdown, 1,600 buses are off the road and there is no revenue. We are losing Rs 1 crore 40 lakh per day and hence the management, and chairman and managing director (CMD) Nayana Gunde has decided to propose hiring of the buses for companies,” said Anant Waghmare, traffic manager, PMPML.He added, “If the companies wish to use PMPML buses, we are offering them on hire at the rate of Rs 83.50 per km, and with a minimum run of 2000km per month. This decision is to sustain our transport since the buses are not plying. We are also offering them choice of buses - 25 seater or 35 seater.”Earlier, PMPML buses were used for schools in the city at Rs 70 per km and for a minimum run of 30km.Responding to PMPML’s proposal, government-run National AIDS Research Institute (NARI) asked PMPML to supply four buses to ply its staff.“We have been exploring options for the staff to come to office and commute without any problem during the ongoing Covid-19 lockdown, which made us write to PMPML to see if they have a viable solution. We have to see the willingness of the employee as well as the financial constraints before we take any decision,” administrative officer, NARI, said.Dattareya Pandit, an IT programme manager, “We used to have our own bus service from the company, which was enabled with GPS and hence, was easy to trace besides, our buses have special card machine to swipe for the bus charges, but post lockdown, I feel intercity bus services will be allowed and if that doesn’t work, then companies will have to look at the PMPML option, then it will be a viable option.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pmpml-offers-its-buses-for-hire-to-firms-to-generate-revenue-during-lockdown/story-MD8qWmIr5qiAhV33xo5mFJ.html

Talking to Hindustan Times over the phone from the hospital, an elated Grewal said that she is excited to go home and join duty as soon as her home quarantine period is over.She had been on curfew duty, getting just four to five hours of sleep everyday, when she tested positive for the virus on April 17. Her first thoughts on being tested positive were-- had she passed on the infection to her parents, both diabetic patients. But luckily, their tests came out negative and Grewal could concentrate on her own health. At the hospital, she spent time catching up with her friends and family over phone, playing ludo online, watching shows on online streaming sites and doing yoga. “The department had arranged a yoga instructor, who used to teach us asanas online,” she says.Grewal also took to making videos to keep her well-wishers updated about her health. She says her Facebook page has been flooded with messages from concerned residents ever since the news of her infection got out. “There are so many messages that I am unable to read all. But I make sure to respond to at least 20 persons everyday. I wish to convey my gratitude to everyone who prayed for my speedy recovery,” she says. She is also all praise for the doctors, nurses and other staff at the DMCH who helped her recover. “The staff here took good care of me and fed me a balanced diet. We were also given turmeric milk and tulsi tea to boost our immunity. Doctors have now advised me 15 days’ rest and I can’t wait to get home,” says the cop who is set to be discharged on Friday. The 27-year-old, who is station house officer of Basti Jodhewal, says, “Earlier, due to my busy schedule, I rarely got time to spend with my family. I am hoping to make up for that in this quarantine period. I am also looking forward to learn cooking from my mother and update my knowledge by reading law-related books.”A graduate in Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) from the Kamla Lohtia SD College, Grewal had joined the police department in 2015 after clearing the recruitment exam. She was on probation for two years after which she was given charge of the police post in Jalandhar before being finally promoted as SHO in August last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cured-and-raring-to-go-si-arshpreet-excited-to-join-duty/story-wn8epCXfgyHDpKepsXX6HM.html
01-05-2020||Football||Chuni Goswami - A footballer who could count India’s president as his fan||Chuni Goswami, captain of the 1962 Asian Games football gold medal winning India team, died after a heart attack on Thursday at a nursing home near his residence in south Calcutta. He was 82 and is survived by wife Basanti and son Sudipto. Goswami’s death comes a little over one month after former India teammate PK Banerjee’s passing. Banerjee, Goswami and Tulsidas Balaram were part of a famous India forwardline which scored nine of India’s 11 goals on way to the Asian Games gold medal in Jakarta.India won 12 of the 16 games they played together. All of them came between 1958 and 1962; the trio scoring 20 of India’s 36 goals in that period. Goswami, who played inside-left in a five-forward formation, scored seven of those goals.Of wiry build, Goswami had remarkable ball control and could dribble his way out of most situations. Rival defenders would be exhorted by their coaches to look at the ball and never at Goswami’s legs for they would then have no hope of getting the ball. And for a player that lean, Goswami could pack a punch. Goswami’s Mohun Bagan and India teammate Jarnail Singh called him an artist.Known to be a tough taskmaster, the famous India coach Syed Rahim had a soft spot for Goswami. Once, Goswami joined an India camp late and a player pointed that out to Rahim. “Play like him and I will let you join late too,” Rahim said. Goswami debuted for India against Myanmar in the 1958 Asian Games, scoring in his first match. He played international football till 1964 netting 13 goals in 36 games. In that time, India played the 1960 Olympics where they narrowly lost to a heavyweight Hungary team that had Florian Albert --- European Player of the Year in 1967 --- and players from top clubs such as Ferencvaros and Honved.Two years later, Goswami led India to the Asian Games gold. Goswami scored three goals in the campaign including a brace in the semi-finals as India beat South Vietnam 3-2. The other goal in the semi-final came from Singh with Goswami providing the final pass.He quit international football after the Merdeka Cup in 1964 and after India finished runners-up in the Asian Cup that year.Goswami was a pin-up in Indian sport much before the term became popular. He could count among his fans Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, India’s second President. Seeing him warm-up before a Durand Cup final, where the President was the chief guest, Radhakrishnan said: So, I see Chuni again. You seem to have become a permanent feature in the finals.”This was when Mohun Bagan --- the only club Goswami played for, starting as a junior in 1946 and retiring in 1968 --- won the Durand Cup for three seasons in a row, from 1963. Goswami scored 200 goals for Mohun Bagan --- many of them from the final pass of outside-left Arumainayagam with whom he had great understanding --- after joining the senior team in 1954. He also won three Santosh Trophy titles for Bengal.Such was Goswami’s star power that stories abound in the Kolkata Maidan of a section of the crowd leaving the Mohun Bagan ground, forsaking a league match of their favourite club, to see him turn out in an office league game. This when Goswami had long retired from football.“Chuni had good looks and exuded star appeal. He was different: a sportsman who would buy books of PG Wodehouse and Somerset Maugham to get through long train journeys. He had a great sense of humour and a never-say-die attitude,” said Raju Mukherjee, the former Bengal cricket captain who played under Goswami.Goswami was also adept at tennis and was a regular on the South Club courts and those of the Calcutta Cricket and Football Club till the turn of the century. He also played a mean hand at carrom, the board game.But if there was one sport Goswami aced after football, it was cricket. Goswami first played for Bengal in 1962. His taking on the fiery Roy Gilchrist, who was representing Hyderabad, and scoring over 40 as a middle-order batsman is still talked about in Bengal. When he was still ruling the club football scene in India, Goswami’s in-swingers helped a combined Central and East Zone team beat Gary Sobers’ West Indies.Goswami took cricket more seriously after his football career. He played 46 first-class matches as an all-rounder. He led Bengal to two Ranji Trophy finals.“He never bothered looking at the pitch, saying it would be the same for 22 players. Once, a player complained about the sight-screen and Goswami said, ‘focus on the ball and not the screen. Did you have a screen when you played cricket in the city’s bylanes?’,” said Mukherjee. “His will to fight was infectious and we learnt so much about fitness from him,” said former India left-arm spinner Dilip Doshi who also played for Bengal under Goswami. Born in Kishoreganj, now in Bangladesh, Subimal ‘Chuni’ Goswami caught the eye of BD Chatterjee who groomed him and got him into Mohun Bagan.Goswami worked in a nationalised bank and was the first director of the Tata Football Aacdemy in Jamshedpur, a post he held from 1986-90. He won the Arjuna award in 1963 --- one year after Balaram and two after Banerjee --- and the Padma Shri in 1983. He was given the Mohun Bagan Ratna, an award initiated by the club in 2001 to honour club legends, in 2005, the same year he was made Sheriff of Kolkata. The Postal Department issued a stamp in his honour on January 15, his birthday, this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/football/legendary-footballer-chuni-goswami-no-more/story-IrD19dGqFfVL28yftFFPOP.html
01-05-2020||Pune||Finding sponsors will be tough in post-covid era, says president of Maharashtra Squash Rackets Association||With squash steadily gaining popularity in the state, players have been hit hard by the lockdown imposed due to the Covid-19 (coronavirus) pandemic. Many tournaments and summer camps have been cancelled this year. However, what seems to be troubling the president of the Maharashtra Squash Rackets Association, the most, is funding.“Sponsors play a very important role in individual sports like squash and even in tennis, I think. Till now we received good support of sponsors to conduct tournaments, but now even they will feel the pinch of the lockdown because of the economic losses and even for us, it will be a tough task to get sponsors in the post-covid era,” said Pradeep Khandre, president, Maharashtra Squash Rackets Association (MSRA).Camps cancelled“Players are disappointed as they are missing a lot of opportunities to train during the summer. We organise camps in various parts of the state under renowned national coaches which is a big help for the players. Pune leg of PSA HCL SRFI India tour (June 13-16) also got cancelled and state players were looking forward to it,” said Khandre.“Along with Pune and Mumbai, the idea was to conduct camps in other districts as well as players from smaller districts are also showing interest in the game nowadays,” added Khandre.Social media activitiesSince the lockdown, MSRA has been engaging players with various activities on social media and has also advised them to continue practice at home.“Since the lockdown started, we ran an awareness campaign for our players. Top players of Maharashtra who have represented India – Urvashi Joshi and Mahesh Mangaonkar - helped spread awareness about what the precautions which need to be taken care during the pandemic and exercises which they can continue during the lockdown,” said Khandre.In Maharashtra, there are 100 coaches and all of them are currently busy in preparing special online programmes for the players.“Out of 100, 40 are certified level coaches, we have advised all of them to stay in constant touch with the players and work on their fitness at moment. I wish the situation improves soon because personally I feel training in front of a coach is completely different, than training at home,” added Khandre.Webinar for coaches and playersMSRA has also planned webinars for coaches and players. Association is aiming to conduct sessions with current/past players, coaches, sports physiotherapists and psychologists. “We are finalising the schedule and every day we are planning to conduct one session. It is the best time to conduct these sessions. Sharing of experience by senior players will definitely help upcoming players,” added Khandre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/finding-sponsors-will-be-tough-in-post-covid-era-says-president-of-maharashtra-squash-rackets-association/story-KolxEkEkTm8H4PfiTMrYpJ.html
01-05-2020||World||‘I died and came back’: 12-year-old recovers from coronavirus||As her desperately sick daughter was being airlifted to a hospital, Jennifer Daly was thinking about all the parts of life that still lay ahead for her 12-year-old and whether she’d ever experience them: Would she get to fall in love? Would she get the chance to get married and have her own children? Driving across the causeway that separates the family’s home north of Lake Pontchartrain from the New Orleans hospital where their daughter was taken — with what was later determined to be a coronavirus infection — she was forced to imagine a life without her Juliet.“She’s the sweetest girl. She’s the sweetest girl in the whole world. And she does not deserve this. And I was praying to God ... just please, please help, please help me,” said Jennifer, speaking from the family’s Covington home Thursday, with her husband Sean and their now-recovered daughter.As Juliet and her 5-year-old brother spar with each other using pool noodles, it’s hard to imagine that just earlier this month Juliet was fighting for her life. At one point she had a heart attack and doctors had to perform CPR for two minutes before she came back.“I died and came back,” Juliet said.Her coronavirus journey didn’t start with many of the symptoms that have affected adults — breathing problems, for example. She had stomach pain and vomiting, and her mother, who’s a radiologist, thought maybe it was appendicitis or some type of stomach problem. But Juliet’s lips were also turning blue and her limbs were cold.Juliet quickly ended up in the emergency room of the local hospital. There, she had a heart attack, underwent CPR, and was eventually airlifted to Ochsner Medical Center. Dr. Jake Kleinmahon was one of the doctors who was there to meet her and care for her over the next ten days.“Juliet came in as one of the sickest children we’ve taken care of with Covid-19,” said Kleinmahon. The top chamber of her heart was not working correctly with the bottom chamber, and she was developing “multisystem organ failure,” he said.Kleinmahon said children with coronavirus infections often have different symptoms than adults, such as the abdominal problems Juliet had, or rashes in other cases. He said many children also have another virus besides the coronavirus and that was the case with Juliet.For most people, the virus causes no, mild or moderate symptoms, but some suffer severe disease and even death.Juliet was on a ventilator for four days, during which she was sedated and then was eventually able to breathe on her own. She was discharged on April 15. The doctor said her heart function is now completely normal.Although she likely has a little trauma to her heart that should decrease over time, he expects she’ll have a “totally normal life.” When she regained consciousness, her parents said she immediately worried about missing school. Her mother said that when she told Juliet what had happened, her eyes got as big as saucers.“At first I was freaking out a lot,” Juliet said. And then she was worried about whether there were any lasting effects to her body.Jennifer said she and her husband hadn’t known anyone who’d even been infected with coronavirus until their daughter became so drastically ill. If they hadn’t gotten her to the hospital in time, they don’t know if she’d be alive today. She’s glad Juliet doesn’t remember those four days on a ventilator — days Jennifer will never forget.“All she remembers is daddy telling her she’s going to go to sleep. ‘They’re going to put a tube down your throat. You’re gonna go on a helicopter ride. You’re gonna wake up in a new hospital and mommy will be there’” said Jennifer. “Well, that’s what happened.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/i-died-and-came-back-12-year-old-recovers-from-coronavirus/story-U61lREiN31LaCJ2BDxrEPP.html
01-05-2020||World||UK coronavirus death toll reaches 27,510||UK has shot past its 100,000 daily coronavirus tests target set for the end of April with 122,347 testing on Thursday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced on Friday.Addressing the daily Downing Street briefing, the senior minister hailed the “audacious” testing goal being met by a coordinated team effort as he revealed a further 739 deaths from Covid-19, taking the country’s toll from the pandemic to 27,510.“At the beginning of last month, I set a goal that anyone who needs a test should get a test. That as a nation we should achieve 100,000 per day by the end of the month,” Hancock said.“I knew it was an audacious goal, but we needed an audacious goal because testing is so important. I can announce we have met our goal. This unprecedented expansion in British testing capability is an incredible achievement,” he said.The criteria set by the government for people accessing coronavirus tests cover over 25 million National Health Service (NHS) staff on the frontlines of the pandemic, key workers and others who need to leave the house to go to their job.Hancock said that testing will form the basis “for getting Britain back on her feet” and the easing of the lockdown in place to keep a lid on the rate of infection, referred to as R, with work underway to recruit the 18,00 contact tracers to keep track of the deadly virus.“People will be able to know if they had been in contact with someone with the disease. This will drive the infection rate down. It will get R down and hold R down,” he said.Professor John Newton, Director of Health Improvement at Public Health England, joined the Cabinet minister as the UK’s national coronavirus testing coordinator and declared that the country had succeeded in putting in place world-leading testing facilities.“We now have a flexible and substantial testing capability in the UK to tell us how the virus is spreading across the country,” he said.It was claimed that the latest data from hospitals and across the wider community reflects “real progress” as the number of infections is falling.The officials revealed that hospital admissions, particularly in London which was way ahead in terms of the infection than other parts of Britain, is continuing a downward trend and the number of people in critical care is also falling across the board.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-coronavirus-death-toll-rises-by-739-to-27-510/story-QD1fSk5WGNnoHHRwVm2HhP.html
01-05-2020||World||Canada bans assault-style weapons after mass shooting||Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Friday that Canada is banning the use and trade of assault-style weapons immediately.Trudeau cited numerous mass shootings in the country, including the killing of 22 people in Nova Scotia April 18 and 19. He announced the ban of over 1,500 models and variants of assault-style firearms, including the AR-15 and other weapons that have been used in a number of mass shootings in the United States“Canadians need more than thoughts and prayers,” Trudeau said.The Cabinet order doesn’t forbid owning any of the military-style weapons and their variants but it does ban the use and trade in them. He said the order has a two-year amnesty period for current owners, and there will be a compensation program that will require a bill passed in Parliament.In the meantime, they can be exported, returned to manufacturers, and transported only to deactivate them or get rid of them. In certain limited circumstances, they can be used for hunting.“You do not need an AR-15 to take down a deer,” Trudeau said. “So, effective immediately, it is no longer permitted to buy, sell, transport, import or use military-grade, assault weapons in this country.”Trudeau said the weapons were designed for one purpose and one purpose only: to kill the largest number of people in the shortest amount of time.“There is no use - and no place - for such weapons in Canada,” he said.Mass shootings are relatively rare in Canada, but Trudeau said they are happening more often. Trudeau noted he was nearby when in Montreal when gunman Marc Lepine killed 14 women and himself at Montreal’s Ecole Polytechnique college in 1989. The Ruger Mini-14 Lepine used is among weapons included in the ban.“As of today the market for assault weapons is closed. Enough is enough,” Public Safety Minister Bill Blair said.Trudeau has said his government would introduce further gun control legislation prohibiting military-style assault weapons, a measure that had already been planned before the coronavirus pandemic interrupted the current parliamentary session.The gunman in Nova Scotia, 51-year-old Gabriel Wortman, shot 13 people to death and set fires that killed nine others in one of the worst mass shootings in the country’s history. Police have said he used a handgun that was obtained in Canada and long guns that he obtained in the U.S., but they have not specifically said what guns he used. The rampage started with an assault on his girlfriend and it ended with 22 people dead in communities across central and northern Nova Scotia. A number of people had disputes with the gunman.Opposition Conservative leader Andrew Scheer accused Trudeau of using the “immediate emotion of the horrific attack in Nova Scotia to push the Liberals’ ideological agenda and make major firearms policy changes.”Scheer said the Nova Scotia shooter did not have a firearms licence, so all of his guns were illegal.“Taking firearms away from law-abiding citizens does nothing to stop dangerous criminals who obtain their guns illegally,” Scheer said in a statement. “The vast majority of gun crimes are committed with illegally obtained firearms. Nothing the Trudeau Liberals announced today addresses this problem.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-bans-assault-style-weapons-after-mass-shooting/story-a8jDvShhPi8XX877juF7HN.html
01-05-2020||World||Kuwait offers to evacuate 45,000 Indians who benefited from visa amnesty scheme||Kuwait on Friday offered to evacuate thousands of illegal Indian workers who benefited from a general amnesty, even as people familiar with developments said the two sides were in touch to resolve the issue.Kuwaiti ambassador Jassem Al-Najem highlighted his government’s efforts to evacuate “all illegal workers of different nationalities, including Indian nationals, who were granted general amnesty”, according to a statement.The Kuwaiti government has offered to send back the workers to their countries “free of cost and by its own civil airlines”, Al-Najem said. “Kuwait is looking forward to work with the Indian government to implement its massive evacuation plan to bring back the Indians who are willing to come back voluntarily to India after the complete lockdown ends on May 3…,” he added.The statement was issued hours before the Indian government announced a two-week extension of the nationwide Covid-19 lockdown alongside the phased easing of restrictions in some areas.Though the Kuwaiti statement didn’t give the number of Indians who benefited from the general amnesty, people familiar with developments in both countries said almost 45,000 Indian workers had been covered by the scheme.Amid the economic downturn caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the Kuwaiti side is keen on the speedy evacuation of the illegal workers from all countries.“The Indian embassy is in touch with the Kuwaiti authorities to explore the best possible mechanism to facilitate the return of Indians form Kuwait,” one of the people cited above said on condition of anonymity.There was no official word on the development from the Indian side.Kuwait had recently announced an amnesty till April 30 for illegal migrants and workers whose visas expired after the imposition of Covid-19-related travel restrictions. Migrants who were undocumented or overstayed their visas will be allowed to leave Kuwait without paying fines.Al-Najem also thanked the Indian government for facilitating the evacuation of Kuwaiti nationals stranded in the country on Kuwait Airways flights last week. He also thanked the Indian government for deploying a medical rapid response team to Kuwait for two weeks and providing two tonnes of medical equipment.“The ambassador highly appreciated the Indian government’s gestures to continue supply of medicine, including paracetamol tablets and foods to Kuwait,” the statement said.Indian and Kuwaiti authorities had to resort to damage control this week after a Cabinet note of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) member state that expressed concern about “targeting of Indian Muslims” was leaked on social media.Al-Najem reiterated a statement he had issued earlier this week that both countries shared the foreign policy principle of “non-interference in other countries’ affairs”.Indians constitute the largest group of expatriates in Kuwait, with an estimated population of 1 million and their annual remittances are worth about $4.8 billion. India is also among Kuwait’s top 10 trading partners, with bilateral trade worth $6.2 billion during 2015-16.Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Kuwaiti counterpart Sheikh Khaled Al-Hamad Al-Sabah and external affairs minister S Jaishankar and his counterpart Ahmed Nasser Al-Mohammed Al-Sabah have spoken on phone recently regarding cooperation to control the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kuwait-offers-to-evacuate-45-000-indians-who-benefited-from-visa-amnesty-scheme/story-mhSeSuAxRKv9oLDGZmVtmK.html

President Donald Trump has publicly backed the protestors weighed in again Friday asking her in a tweet to “give a little, and put out the fire”.She extended the restrictions to May 15, after the Republican-controlled legislature refused. Arms are allowed in the Michigan statehouse. Some legislators wore bulletproof vests to the floor fo the House.An increasing number of states are reopening and have allowed selected businesses to resume operation with strict social-distancing guidelines as the number of news cases have continued to drop countrywide.Daily fatalities have dropped significantly, for instance, from the peak of over 4,000 around April 16. On Friday, the toll went up more than 63,019 with 2,029 death in the last 24 hours and the number of infections was up by 29,515 to 1.07 million.Signalling further continuing improvement in the situation, President Trump will leave the White House for the time since late March. He is scheduled to leave for Camp David - the presidential retreat in the adjoining state of Maryland.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/armed-protesters-demand-end-to-covid-19-curbs-in-us-state/story-EHxpswPfu5KeNEnLYwzIhP.html
01-05-2020||World||Hong Kong police spray tear gas at protesters gathered in a shopping mall||Hong Kong police used pepper spray on Friday to disperse over a hundred protesters in a shopping mall who were singing and chanting pro-democracy slogans.The demonstrators sang the protest anthem “Glory to Hong Kong” and chanted “Glory to Hong Kong, revolution of our times” in the New Town Plaza mall in Hong Kong’s New Territories.As protesters gathered in the mall, riot police stopped and searched some and later told them to leave, saying they were violating social-distancing rules. The police then sprayed tear gas to disperse the crowd before cordoning off the atrium of the mall.The protest was one of several that went ahead on May 1, Labor Day, despite rules that forbid public gatherings of more than four people.Small groups of protesters also gathered near Kowloon’s Mong Kok and Kwun Tong subway stations.Organizers initially planned citywide protests but many were canceled, with the organizers urging people to support pro-democracy restaurants instead.Friday’s protests were the latest in a string of demonstrations over the past week in which protesters gathered in shopping malls. They follow the arrest of 15 pro-democracy activists and former lawmakers last Saturday.The demonstrations are a continuation of a movement that began last June to protest an extradition bill that would have allowed detainees in Hong Kong to be transferred to mainland China. Although the bill was later withdrawn, the demonstrations continued for months before a lull starting in January as the coronavirus pandemic broke out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-police-spray-tear-gas-at-protesters-gathered-in-a-shopping-mall/story-60heYVDnxDoiwEAqSzVVII.html
01-05-2020||World||Donald Trump points to Wuhan lab as Covid-19 source, threatens new tariffs as punishment||President Donald Trump on Thursday said the United States has intelligence that establishes a virology lab in Wuhan is the source of the pandemic and indicated new tariffs as his administration considers a range of punitive measures such as partly cancelling public debt and allowing victims to sue China.“Yes I have,” Trump told reporters when asked if he has seen intelligence that traces the epidemic’s origin to the Wuhan lab with a high degree of confidence. He did not share any evidence and when asked how he felt confident it was the Wuhan lab, he demurred, saying, “I am not allowed to tell you that.”Earlier Thursday, office of the Director of National Intelligence, which heads the US intelligence community, said in the statement that though it concurs with the wider scientific community that the coronavirus was “not manmade or genetically modified”, it was still examining “whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan”.The source of the epidemic remains disputed. China has denied it started at the Wuhan lab and has blamed a local seafood market instead.The United Sates has been investigating the origin of the epidemic in China, and the Wuhan lab has clearly not been ruled out, and the true magnitude of the crisis in China, which is widely suspected of suppressing the real numbers.Questions are being raised about China’s handling of the epidemic and calls for an impartial investigation into it have been growing worldwide, most recently by Australia.The US intelligence community is conducting its own investigation as the office of the DNI stated Thursday. But it was not clear yet if the administration expected to revea more on the findings and how soon. The president has turned up the rhetoric on China in recent days as his won administration’s handling of the crisis has come under increasing criticism for not responding aggressively. He recently indicated he was not averse to making China pay for losses incurred by the United States.When asked on Thursday about reports that he could cancel US debt obligations to China, Trump said he could “do it differently” and act in “probably a little bit more of a forthright manner”.“I could do the same thing but even for more money, just putting on tariffs,” he said.The new tariffs, if he does impose them, will be in addition to the 25% duty still in force on $370 billion worth of imports from China left over from the trade war between the two countries that ended in January with the signing of a limited Phase One deal.The Washington Post reported Thursday that punitive measures under discussion partly cancelling public debt owed to China, which is the second largest holder of US public debt with around $1 trillion, and stripping China of sovereign immunity and allow American victims of the epidemic to sure China for damages.Officials from across US federal government were expected to meet Thursday to map the course of action but the president is reported to be tilting towards punishing China, away from a more moderate response being advocated by his economic advisers.

01-05-2020||World||Virus worries haunt workers demanding rights on May Day||No job at all, or a job without enough protections — millions of workers worldwide are marking international labor day trapped between hunger and fear, as more countries and states reopen for business even though the coronavirus pandemic is far from vanquished.Beijing’s Forbidden City cracked open its doors, and shopping malls from Texas to Indiana were set to do the same Friday, while world leaders try to salvage virus-battered economies without unleashing new waves of infections.With traditional May Day labor marches curtailed by strict limits on public gatherings, Turkish protesters attempted to stage a wildcat demonstration. California activists planned strikes, and Parisians sang from balconies to plead their causes: workplace masks, health insurance or more government aid for the jobless.It’ was a melancholy International Workers’ Day for garment industry workers across southeast Asia such as Wiryono, a father of two in Indonesia’s capital who was laid off last month as retailers slashed orders. His side gig delivering coffee dried up, too, amid a virus lockdown. So he set up a clothing repair business to make ends meet.“I don’t earn as much as I got from the clothing factory. But I have to feed my wife and kids every day,” said Wiryono, who goes by only one name.In Bangladesh, production is starting back up even despite a rising number of new confirmed cases of a virus that has infected more than 3.2 million and killed at least 230,000 worldwide.A government-ordered lockdown couldn’t extinguish the May Day protest spirit in Greece, where demonstrators lined up two meters (six feet) apart in careful rows in Athens’ Syntagma Square. Organizers, wearing masks and gloves, used tape measures to set out exact positions for the protesters with large colored squares.Greeks who work by doing deliveries staged a motorized protest, driving through Athens on their motorbikes, and police were out in force to ensure residents don’t head from cities to the countryside, another May Day tradition.“We are praying for all workers, so that no one will lack work, and all will be fairly paid and can enjoy the dignity of work and the beauty of rest,” Pope Francis pleaded during a private morning Mass.May Day labor protests started in the 19th century in the United States, where this week the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits surpassed a staggering 30 million — and joblessness in April could hit numbers not seen since the Great Depression of the 1930s.Essential workers were expected to strike around the U.S. on Friday to demand safer conditions during the pandemic, while other groups organized rallies to protest stay-at-home orders they say are crippling the U.S. economy.Lacey Ward, an Omaha hairstylist, said she is worried that the Nebraska governor’s decision to let salons reopen on May 4 could put her and her family at risk. She would prefer to collect unemployment until the danger subsides.“I feel like we are literally the guinea pigs in this situation,” she said.May Day is a state holiday in many countries, but lockdowns mean this is the first time that Russia — whose prime minister has the virus — will not hold mass demonstrations on Red Square.In Turkey, police and protesters wearing masks faced off in Istanbul, and 15 people were detained for defying confinement rules.In the Czech Republic, people honked horns, played drums or shouted at midday in a special “noisy protest” over the government’s handling of the crisis. And hundreds of Czechs who commute to work in Germany and Austria plan to block a border crossing to protest restrictions imposed on them amid the pandemic.In the French spirit of keeping leaders in check, some Paris residents defied home confinement rules to hold unauthorized protests. Others staged a midday musical protest against French President Emmanuel Macron’s handling of the pandemic, singing from balconies and windows to the tune of the rebel’s anthem “Bella Ciao.”Instead of the usual May Day concert in Italy, musical artists will take turns performing solo in empty venues. As Italy prepares to reopen some businesses Monday, unions demanded scrupulous attention to social distancing at work stations and on assembly lines, and the sanitizing of factories before they start up again.A holiday atmosphere enlivened South Africa’s streets Friday, as the May Day holiday is also when the country has begun easing its strict lockdown. People were permitted to walk outside for exercise and some are returning to work in small batches.The country where the coronavirus first erupted also is opening up: China’s ancient, majestic Forbidden City reopened on Friday with all tickets for the May 1-5 holiday sold out, and a limit of 5,000 visitors a day, down from the earlier maximum of 80,000.Visitor Bian Jiang reveled at the chance to visit without huge crowds and said, “When walking in some areas without others around, I felt like I’m getting back to history.”In Spain, the closing of a massive field hospital that had symbolized the country’s battle against the virus and its overwhelmed health system held significance.Malaysia and Thailand prepared to reopen some businesses. Japan’s prime minister, however, announced his virus state of emergency would stay in place for another month.Worker and customer safety is a key question as the biggest U.S. mall operator, Simon Property Group Inc., plans to open 49 shopping centers Friday across 10 states, with mask-wearing employees and a limited number of shoppers.President Donald Trump chose not to extend the White House’s social-distancing guidelines past their expiration Thursday. Those guidelines encouraged people to work from home and avoid restaurants, groups and nonessential travel.Trump continued to speculate on the origins of the coronavirus, and intelligence agencies said they are still examining a notion put forward by the president and aides that the pandemic may have resulted from an accident at a Chinese lab.The virus has killed over 230,000 worldwide, including more than 61,000 in the U.S., according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. Confirmed infections globally topped 3.2 million, with 1 million in the U.S., but the true numbers are believed to be much higher because of limited testing, differences in counting the dead and concealment by some governments.As Australia plans to open up, Prime Minister Scott Morrison urged people to download a COVIDSafe app to help track cases, and warned: “The coronavirus is still out there.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/virus-worries-haunt-workers-demanding-rights-on-may-day/story-uU1dSBNkx5l2PNTP4lF24O.html

Because it is a foreign organisation, it is not possible to ban and dissolve it, the ministry said in a statement.Israel, which with the United States had been pushing Germany to ban the group, praised the move. Israel urged other European Union countries to take similar action.The EU classifies Hezbollah’s military wing as a terrorist group, but not its political wing. Britain introduced legislation in February of last year, before it left the EU, that classified Hezbollah as a terrorist organisation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-condemns-germany-s-designation-of-hezbollah-as-terrorist-group/story-ia3XOodFVl2l4IP3Se88LJ.html

01-05-2020||World||Japan PM Abe leaning towards extending state of emergency, to decide May 4||Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said on Friday he was leaning towards extending the country’s state of emergency for about a month as experts said coronavirus restrictions should remain in place until the number of cases falls further. The emergency is now due to expire on May 6 but Abe said the situation remains tough and further cooperation is needed from Japanese citizens, although he would make a final decision on May 4 after consultations with experts. “Thanks to the efforts of our citizens, we have managed to avoid an explosion of cases as has been seen overseas,” Abe told reporters on Friday evening. “But the medical situation remains tough and we must call for forther cooperation from our nation.” He added that he was inclined towards extending the state of emergency for roughly a month and would hold a news conference to explain his decision.On Thursday, Abe warned citizens to prepare for a “drawn-out battle” against the new coronavirus and political sources told Reuters the government was planning to lengthen the emergency for about a month.Abe said he would base his final decision on the recommendation of a panel of experts, which said earlier on Friday that while the number of cases appeared to be on the decline, the situation was not as good as they would like.  “For a while, we are going to need to keep these policies going,” panel member Shigeru Omi told a news conference, adding that there were regional variations in outbreaks and the medical system in some areas was struggling to cope.Economics Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura said experts had also said some regions needed to keep strict restrictions in place while others could start to ease them. Abe said he would consider this matter in making his final decision. Japan has confirmed more than 14,000 cases and 436 deaths from COVID-19, the highly contagious lung disease caused by the new coronavirus, according to an NHK tally. Of the confirmed cases, more than 4,000 were in the capital, Tokyo, with 165 new ones reported on Friday.But there are worries that Japan’s limited testing regime has undercounted many likely coronavirus cases, and fears that the medical system may be strained caring for them. The outbreak and the concurrent slump in business activity is darkening the outlook for the world’s third biggest economy, prompting calls for more spending even after parliament approved an extra budget to fund a $1.1 trillion stimulus package.Consumer prices in Tokyo fell for the first time in three years in April and national factory activity sagged, data showed on Friday, increasing worries the coronavirus outbreak could tip the country back into deflation.WARNINGThe government has appealed for vigilance during the long Golden Week holiday - normally a peak travel period - that runs through May 6, calling on people to stay home and reduce contact with others.Abe declared the emergency on April 7, initially for Tokyo and several other prefectures after a jump in infections, and later extended it nationwide.It gives governors greater power to tell people to stay at home and ask businesses to close, but in most cases does not mandate penalties for non-compliance, relying instead on social pressure and traditional respect for authority.Tokyo has seen a decline in daily reported cases since hitting a peak of 201 on April 17, with further falls into double digits this week. But the city’s governor, Yuriko Koike, has warned residents not to be complacent.On Friday, the Nippon Foundation, a philanthropic organisation, unveiled the first wing of a field hospital built in a waterside district of Tokyo.Set up in an arena built for Paralympic sports, the 100-bed facility features alcoves containing a bed, locker and table set apart from each other. Other beds will be put in tents and expanded as needed, NHK reported. The International Olympic Committee and the government in March postponed the summer Olympic and Paralympic Games in Japan for a year, until July 2021, because of the COVID-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-pm-abe-leaning-towards-extending-state-of-emergency-to-decide-may-4/story-K2hmSLEK5ji6v1IWSfvDvM.html
01-05-2020||World||Worst-hit Hubei to lower Covid risk level, outbreak ‘basically cut off’||The central Chinese province of Hubei which was worst-hit in the coronavirus outbreak in the country will lower its emergency response from the highest to the second-highest level from Saturday.The novel coronavirus first emerged after a zoonotic event from the provincial capital, Wuhan, late last year.Hubei would be the last province in China to lower the emergency level.Beijing authorities too lowered the city’s risk-level earlier this week after no new infection was reported for more than two weeks.As the Chinese capital prepares to host the nation’s highest-profile political meeting, the annual parliamentary Two Session, later in May, the city has relaxed quarantine requirements for domestic travellers from Thursday (April 30).The easing, however, does not apply to overseas visitors.In Hubei, prevention and control measures against the epidemic will be adjusted following the downgrading of the emergency response level, Yang Yunyan, deputy governor of Hubei, was quoted as saying by official news agency, Xinhua, as saying at a press conference in Wuhan on Friday.Yang said Hubei, which reported more than 67000 Covid-19 infections, the most in China, hasn’t had a new confirmed case since April 4.The province also reported over 3200 deaths, the most in the 4643-death toll in China.Overall, China has reported more than 84000 cases of Covid-19.All cities and counties in the province were designated as low risk zones on April 18, Yang said, adding that on April 26, all hospitalised cases were cleared from Wuhan.The emergency and routine control measures in the whole region effectively reduced and controlled the outbreak, the official said. “After more than three months of precise and tight prevention and control, the virus spread is “basically cut off” in Hubei, Yang said.The authorities of the Chinese provinces of Hubei and Guangdong in south China were the first to declare a first-level public health emergency because of the outbreak on January 23.The first-level public health emergency meant mobilisation of personnel, government departments and enterprises in fighting against the outbreak, as well as using all necessary materials and resources. In order to prevent the spread of the outbreak, local governments canceled public events, suspended the operation of companies and educational institutions, restricted access to potentially dangerous areas and made temporary requisitions for houses, cars, equipment and other resources.Local authorities also fully restricted the freedom of movement and migration, putting in place epidemiological screening for people and transport and put thousands of residents in quarantine if they are suspected to have contracted the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/worst-hit-hubei-to-lower-covid-risk-level-outbreak-basically-cut-off/story-EkWtDMWTWTmVgbadLwJcUN.html
01-05-2020||World||WHO wants invite to China’s probe into virus origins||The World Health Organization said Friday it hoped China would invite it to take part in its investigations into the animal origins of the novel coronavirus.“WHO would be keen to work with international partners and at the invitation of the Chinese government to participate in investigation around the animal origins,” WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic told AFP in an email.He said the UN health agency understood there were a number of investigations under way in China “to better understand the source of the outbreak”, but added that “WHO is not currently involved in the studies in China.”Scientists believe the killer virus jumped from animals to humans, emerging in China late last year, possibly from a market in Wuhan selling exotic animals for meat.But US President Donald Trump has fuelled speculation and rumours -- generally rejected by experts -- that the virus may have emerged in a top-secret Chinese lab.WHO has also faced scathing criticism from Trump, who earlier this month suspended Washington’s funding after accusing the WHO of downplaying the seriousness of the outbreak and of kowtowing to China.The UN health agency chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus did travel with a team to China in late January, where he met with Chinese President Xi Jinping to learn more about the response.This paved the way, Tedros explained earlier this week, for an international team of scientists to travel there in February to investigate the situation, including experts from China, Germany, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Nigeria, the Russian Federation, Singapore and the United States of America.But as investigations into the origins of the virus have picked up pace in China, the WHO has not been involved. The ongoing investigations are believed to be looking at “human cases with symptom onset in and around Wuhan in late 2019, environmental sampling from markets and farms in areas where the first human cases were identified, and detailed records on the source and type of wildlife species and farmed animals sold in these markets,” Jasarevic said.He stressed that the results from the virus origin studies were “essential to preventing further zoonotic introductions of the virus that causes COVID-19 into the human population.”“WHO continues to collaborate with animal health and human health experts, countries and other partners to identify gaps and research priorities for the control of COVID-19, including the eventual identification of the source of the virus in China,” he said.nl/rjm/lc||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-wants-invite-to-china-s-probe-into-virus-origins/story-WAFrQNsYNrXiAruzJPOkBP.html
01-05-2020||World||Foreign criticism of Hong Kong activists’ arrests “unfounded”: Report||Hong Kong hit back on Friday at Washington and London for condemning the arrests in April of 15 pro-democracy activists, saying that their criticism was “unfounded” and “grossly irresponsible.”Police arrested the activists, including Democratic Party founder Martin Lee, 81, and millionaire publishing tycoon Jimmy Lai, 71, on 18 April, in the biggest crackdown on the pro-democracy movement since the outbreak of mass protests last year.Foreign governments and human rights groups condemned the arrests, with Britain’s Foreign Office saying at the time that the right to peaceful protest was “fundamental to Hong Kong’s way of life” and authorities should avoid “actions that inflame tensions”.In its strongest response to the criticism so far, the Hong Kong government said the remarks by the United States, Britain and the European Parliament were “totally unfounded and amounted to a serious intervention in Hong Kong’s affairs”.“The allegation by some that those arrests amounted to an attack on Hong Kong’s freedoms ... is absurd and can hardly stand the test of any law-abiding jurisdiction,” a spokesman for the government said.Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” style of governance that grants it broad freedoms, including the right to protest and an independent judiciary, not seen in the mainland.Critics say Beijing is increasingly encroaching on those freedoms, which the central government rejects.The 15 activists were arrested on charges of organising and participating in anti-government protests last year that crippled parts of the city and posed the gravest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping.The outbreak of the novel coronavirus and measures adopted to curb its spread have seen a relative lull in protests this year, although smaller demonstrations have emerged in the past week amid renewed concerns over Beijing’s tightening grip on the city.Fuelling those worries, questions have been raised in recent weeks over the role of Beijing’s institutions overseeing the city’s affairs - the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office and Liaison Office.The government said criticism over remarks by the offices “only illustrates an ignorance of the constitutional order” of Hong Kong.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/foreign-criticism-of-hong-kong-activists-arrests-unfounded-report/story-YVwf9ozmoBuQRbdDV9T1lM.html
01-05-2020||World||Covid-19: Bangladesh reopens factories, risking new cases||Bangladesh has reopened hundreds of its garment factories this week after nearly one month of closures to fight the coronavirus pandemic in a move critics say risks igniting a sharp increase in infections among workers.An industry group said about 850 factories are operating with fewer workers than usual and following safety guidelines. Labor advocates say not enough is being done to ensure safety for the 4 million workers in Bangladesh’s roughly 4,000 garment factories.The number of factories that have reopened is in dispute. Activists and analysts said Friday about 2,000 garment factories have restarted production.The Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association says only 850 factories had opened by Thursday, using a limited number of workers who live nearby.“The global brands are happy to see the factories opening up as otherwise a whole season would have been lost,” Mohammad Abdur Razzak, secretary of the industry group, said in an email.Razzak said the factories were complying with health guidelines and that inspections found that only four of 105 visited were not meeting standards.As is true elsewhere workers and their employers are torn between suffering still more loss of income by staying closed and risking a surge in infections if they stop taking precautions too soon.The resumption of manufacturing followed a government decision to allow companies to reopen that was made under heavy pressure from businesses. Factories went ahead, fearing they might lose business to competitors in Vietnam, Cambodia, India, Sri Lanka and India.A senior government health official in a major industrial zone near Dhaka urged factories to close down again.Bangladesh has confirmed 7,667 people infected with coronavirus and 168 deaths since its first case was reported on March 8. About 500 new cases are being confirmed daily in the nation of 160 million people, which has only 25 testing facilities and a fragile healthcare system.Thousands of workers reportedly are rushing back to reclaim their jobs in the capital, Dhaka and nearby industrial districts, alarming labor advocates.“Who will take the responsibility if hundreds of workers become ill?” said Kalpona Akter, executive director of the Bangladesh Center for Workers Solidarity.Ahsan H. Mansur, executive director of the local think tank Policy Research Institute, said at least another week should have been allowed to better prepare for reopening.“The factories have resumed operations without giving it much thought,” he said. “There is a huge risk of virus transmission among workers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-bangladesh-reopens-factories-risking-new-cases/story-eOzvdvRDpCP0D1ThAnrfqI.html
01-05-2020||World||Biden denies former staffer’s sexual assault allegation||Joe Biden denied a former Senate staffer’s allegation of sexual assault on Friday, saying the accusation is “not true.”“This never happened,” Biden said in a statement.It’s Biden’s first public comment on an accusation of sexual assault by his former Senate staffer, Tara Reade. He is to appear on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” to discuss the allegation for the first time on television.Biden said he will ask the National Archives to determine whether there is any record of such a complaint being filed.Presumptive Democratic US presidential nominee Joe Biden for the first time on Friday is set to personally address a former Senate aide’s accusation that he sexually assaulted her in 1993 - a claim that his campaign has denied.Biden is scheduled to be interviewed about the matter on the MSNBC program “Morning Joe,” the cable TV network said on Twitter on Thursday. Biden’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment about the interview. His campaign has said the incident never occurred but he has remained silent about it.Earlier on Wednesday, US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the top Democrat in Congress, gave a forceful defense of Biden, highlighting the former vice president’s long history of supporting policies to stop the abuse of women.The interview plan comes after some fellow Democrats urged Biden, 77, to directly respond to the accusation. A California woman named Tara Reade, who worked as a staff assistant in Biden’s US Senate office from December 1992 to August 1993, has accused Biden in media interviews of pinning her against a wall in 1993, reaching under her skirt and pushing his fingers inside her.Biden is set to challenge Republican President Donald Trump, 73, in the Nov. 3 US election. Trump has been accused by more than a dozen women of sexual assault and misconduct over the years, allegations he and his aides have denied.“I think he should respond,” Trump said of Biden at a media briefing on Thursday. “It could be false accusations. I know all about false accusations.”Pelosi, who formally endorsed Biden for president on Monday, noted that staffers who ran Biden’s Senate office have said they had no recollection of a sexual assault complaint.“I have complete respect for the whole #MeToo movement,” Pelosi said at a news conference. “There is also due process and the fact that Joe Biden is Joe Biden.”“He is the personification of hope and optimism and authenticity for our country - a person of great values,” Pelosi added. Reuters has not been able to independently confirm Reade’s accusation and also was unable to reach Reade or a representative for her for comment.Several news outlets that have published Reade’s account, including the New York Times and the Washington Post, have interviewed a friend who said Reade told her about the alleged assault at the time. Another friend told the Times that Reade told her in 2008 about a previous traumatic incident involving Biden. Reade’s brother also confirmed parts of Reade’s account to The Intercept and the Post.On Monday, the Business Insider news website published an interview with a former neighbor who said Reade told her in the mid-1990s that Biden had put his fingers inside her.Reade, 56, told media interviewers she complained at the time about sexual harassment, though not sexual assault, to three of Biden’s Senate aides. The Biden campaign released a statement from one, Marianne Baker, who said she never received any report of inappropriate behavior in nearly 20 years of working for Biden.The Post and Times interviewed the other two aides, both of whom told the newspapers they had no recollection of Reade’s complaint.Reade was one of eight women who last year came forward to say Biden had hugged, kissed or touched them in ways that made them uncomfortable, though none accused him of sexual assault. Reade publicly accused him of the assault on a podcast in March.Some prominent Democratic women have stepped forward to defend Biden. Others have asked him to address the accusation.“It can’t appear that she’s being ignored just because it’s an inconvenient truth for certain people in the Democratic Party,” said Nina Turner, who was national campaign co-chair for the presidential campaign of Senator Bernie Sanders, who dropped out of the race and endorsed Biden.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-to-give-first-interview-responding-to-sexual-assault-accusation/story-u6quKpNUkrpHqmMOvP5hTI.html
01-05-2020||World||Women, minorities and people of colour bear burden of front-line work during pandemic||As America tentatively emerges from weeks of lockdowns, the pandemic has taken its toll on workers who have been on the front lines all along.They have been packing and delivering supplies, caring for the sick and elderly, and keeping streets and buildings clean.They have also watched their co-workers fall ill. Thousands have gotten sick themselves. Many have died.The burden has been borne unevenly across gender, racial and socioeconomic lines, according to an Associated Press analysis of census data in the country’s 100 largest cities. They are mostly women, people of color and more likely to be immigrants.Workers deemed “essential” are also more likely to live below the federal poverty line or hover just above it. They are more likely to have children at home, and many live with others who also have front-line jobs.“What is important about this pandemic is that it has shined a spotlight on workers who have always been essential but before this were invisible,” said David Michaels, professor of environmental and occupational health at the Milken Institute School of Public Health at George Washington University.A look at these workers:THE WAREHOUSE WORKERBorn homeless in New York City, Courtenay Brown is no stranger to hardship.She and her youngest sister both work an Amazon Fresh warehouse in New Jersey and share an apartment in Newark with six cats and a turtle. The sisters fought for their stable life, at one point living in Brown’s car for weeks until they saved enough for a security deposit and first month’s rent.When the pandemic took hold, Brown plunged into her job as a supervisor in the loading dock to get the $2 hourly pay bump and double overtime. Soon, several of her co-workers became infected. Others, she said, didn’t show up.More than 60% of warehouse and delivery workers in most cities are people of color, a figure that rises to more than 95% in Newark.One tough day, Brown pleaded with a co-worker to come to back for a day. The next day, exhausted and limping because of tendinitis, Brown couldn’t bear to come in herself. Her phone rang repeatedly that morning. She threw it across the room.“I thought, ‘this just isn’t worth it,’“ she said.THE GROCERY STORE WORKERJane St. Louis knows many of her customers after 27 years at a Safeway in Damascus, Maryland. Some have brought her cookies. Others have taken out their own fears of the virus on her, including one woman who yelled at her for not wearing gloves.Grocery employees have been among the most visible of America’s front-line workers as people rush to stock up on essentials. Nationwide, they are among the more diverse of front-line workers, split evenly between men and women. In most cities, more than 40% are white, 15% are black and 14% are Hispanic. At least 16% live below the federal poverty line and 15% lack health insurance.The virus has killed at least 30 members of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union. Another 3,000 have either fallen ill or been quarantined for exposure, according to the union, which represents 900,000 people.When St. Louis gets home, her routine takes about an hour and starts in the garage, where she removes her shoes and changes into a bathrobe. She sprays the shoes with Lysol. The clothes go in the washing machine, as does her bathrobe after her shower.She doesn’t want to risk infecting her husband, a construction worker, and 15-year-old granddaughter, who lives with them.“I didn’t know I had anxiety until this started,” St. Louis said.THE TRUCK DRIVERJuan Giraldo and his wife nearly lost their home after he was laid off in the 2008 financial crisis. A refinancing deal saved him from foreclosure but left him tens of thousands of dollars deeper in debt.Now he feels he is sinking back into a familiar nightmare. A contract port truck driver in Los Angeles, Giraldo has seen work dry up as imports slow. He gets fewer than four hauls a week, compared with at least 12 in normal times. He used to make up to $3,500 a month but now earns about $1,500.More than 85% of warehouse and delivery workers in the Los Angeles area are people of color and 53% are foreign-born.Giraldo was raised in Colombia by his grandparents after his father left the war-torn country to work in the fruit groves of California. Giraldo followed in his early 20s, grateful to his father for paving the way but determined to be the kind of parent he never had.“I’m trying to change our history,” he said.As a contract worker, the father of four gets no paid sick leave and relies on California’s state health insurance program.“They are calling us heroes but it’s like they are sending us to World War II with wooden pistols,” Giraldo said.THE JANITORAnnette Brown’s job had been source of stability in a difficult life.For six years, the single mother of two has worked the overnight shift cleaning the second floor of a hospital in Halethorpe, Maryland.The outbreak has made her routine even tougher. She leaves her Baltimore apartment three hours before her shift starts and takes two buses. In the morning, she gets her 8-year-old daughter and 11-year-old son ready for remote schooling, cooks dinner and gets a few hours of sleep before starting over.The unionized job offers her paid sick days, a yearly raise and health insurance — a luxury in an industry where nearly 30% of workers lack it.She just never banked on finding herself working in a pandemic battleground. The hospital now treats COVID-19 patients, and Brown is terrified of going to her $14.70-an-hour job that barely keeps her family above the poverty line.“People are dropping like flies, and I don’t want it to happen to my family,” she said.Janitors are the most financially vulnerable front-line workers. In most cities, more than a quarter live below the poverty line. More than 40% are foreign-born and 74% are people of color.In Baltimore, nearly 75% of them are black. At least 90 members of Brown’s union, 32BJ SEIU, have died of the coronavirus. Another 20,000 have been laid off.Brown’s son tells her not to be afraid, saying: “Fear is nothing but the devil.”THE HEALTH CARE WORKERLinda Silva knew something was wrong when she started coughing on a Saturday in late March. The next day, the nurse’s assistant woke up with chest pain, a fever, a headache and a backache so bad it reminded her of labor pain. She tested positive for COVID-19 a week later.“That was before we realized we actually had COVID cases in our nursing home,” said Silva, who works at the Queens Nassau Nursing Center and the Beacon Rehab and Nursing Center in New York. “We didn’t have the right personal protective equipment at first.”About 75% of health care workers in most cities are women. They are among the front-line workers most likely to have access to health insurance, although 7% lack it. And more than 8% live below the federal poverty line.At least 54 nurses have died of the coronavirus, according to the American Nurses Association.Silva returned to work after recovering. It’s been more than a month since she has hugged her two sons or her husband, who is a building fire safety director.“We say we love each other daily and put our arms around our own selves in front of each other,” she said.THE TRAIN CONDUCTORDesmond Hill is a music writer who plays the flugelhorn, but he makes his living as a New York City subway conductor.His partner and five others he knows were among the more than 3,000 bus and subway workers who tested positive. Another 3,500, including Hill, were put on 14-day quarantine for exposure. Nearly 6,000 have returned to work.At least 83 New York City transit workers have died of the virus, according to the Metropolitan Transit Authority.In New York City, more than 45% of transit workers are black, 20% are white and 24% are Hispanic.“Sometimes you’re looking out on a train and think, ’who am I moving right now? I’m moving homeless people back and forth, why am I out here doing this?’” said Hill, who is back at work.Other times, Hill feels a sense of purpose.“There are also days you can see essential workers, people going to work at grocery stores, Target, hospitals. Those people get off the train and thank you,” he said. “It’s a back-and-forth struggle.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/women-minorities-and-people-of-colour-bear-burden-of-front-line-work-during-pandemic/story-GrdLvPN1lpBdDMXt3BmCCI.html

While the Chinese side in the video says it informed about the discovery of a new virus in January, the US didn’t take any note of it.The one minute 39 seconds video further shows China announcing its lockdown in January, and the US calling it barbaric. It also shows the US accusing China of human rights violation - more than once.The video ends with a jibe from the US that they are always correct “even though we contradict ourselves”. Once Upon a Virus... pic.twitter.com/FY0svfEKc6The video generated a lot of buzz on Twitter. Many users called China’s claims of warning ‘fake’ and ‘misleading.’ Others said this is more damaging to China. False propaganda from the Chinese ambassador to France, whitewashing over its government's deceptions and mocking U.S. objections to its human rights abuses. RTing so folks can see the Chinese government lying in real time -- https://t.co/yg3MX5S5ud This is more damaging to China. LOL. https://t.co/ArHETLyTTz @realDonaldTrump it's your moment to destroy the FAKE NEWSThe coronavirus outbreak started from Wuhan in China in December and spread across the globe, affecting more than three million people and killing over 2,00,000 but Beijing has reported fewer cases and deaths than in the United States, which now has the world’s largest outbreak.US President Donald Trump has lashed out at China for the outbreak. Sharpening his rhetoric on Thursday, Trump said that his hard-fought trade deal with China was now of secondary importance to the coronavirus pandemic and he threatened new tariffs on Beijing, as his administration crafted retaliatory measures over the outbreak.The outburst against China reflected Trump’s growing frustration with Beijing over the pandemic, which has cost tens of thousands of lives in the United States alone, sparked an economic contraction and threatened his chances of re-election in November.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/once-upon-a-virus-china-mocks-us-with-video-on-covid-19-twitter-hits-back/story-em7NbeNp8Z7FGofGXosRkN.html
01-05-2020||World||Moderna signs deal for providing 1 billion Covid-19 doses a year||Moderna Inc., one of the leaders among US companies developing experimental vaccines against the coronavirus, entered a pact with Lonza Group AG aimed at manufacturing 1 billion doses a year.The companies announced a global agreement under which the Swiss chemical and pharmaceutical company will ramp up output of the proposed vaccine, which is based on a novel technology that relies on genetic material called mRNA. They expect the first batches to be produced in the US in July.The agreement is one of several partnerships being struck between drugmakers as they rush to bring protection against Covid-19 to the market. On Thursday, AstraZeneca Plc announced an agreement to make an experimental coronavirus vaccine developed by the University of Oxford, eyeing production capacity for 100 million doses by the end of the year.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicBecause prospects for drugs to treat Covid-19 remain uncertain, rolling out vaccines on a widespread scale could be key to reopening economies from lockdowns. Otherwise new waves of infections could emerge, potentially on a seasonal pattern like the flu. If Moderna and Lonza reach their target of 1 billion doses a year, that would be enough for more than one-eighth of the world’s population.With dozens of projects under way around the world, the Trump administration wants to make shots available for Americans by the end of 2020. Richard Hatchett, head of the Oslo-based Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, has said cooperation between drugmakers could accelerate the process of bringing out a vaccine, which normally would take a year or more.New TechnologyModerna’s experimental shot induces the body’s own cells to make virus-like proteins that stimulate an immune response and prepare for an actual infection. It was one of the first proposed coronavirus vaccines to enter human trials. The company said it plans to begin the next phase of studies this quarter.Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreakThe pact with Lonza will enable a tenfold increase in manufacturing, which Moderna has already begun, according to a statement.Shares of Moderna, which is based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, have more than doubled since the start of the year as its studies of its vaccine candidate have advanced.The smaller players in the race won’t be able to produce a vaccine in large quantities on their own. Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc., another US biotech company in the first stage of testing an experimental vaccine, said Thursday that it agreed to expand a manufacturing collaboration with Germany’s Richter-Helm Biologics.A partnership between Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline Plc announced last month brought together a pair of pharmaceutical giants with manufacturing might. Sanofi will test its experimental coronavirus vaccine with Glaxo supplying so-called adjuvants, additional ingredients that improve efficacy and make it easier to produce shots in larger quantities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moderna-signs-deal-for-providing-1-billion-covid-19-doses-a-year/story-w5nHVk0mjRl8XFhJK2QaHN.html
01-05-2020||World||Coronavirus pandemic could last beyond 2022, likely to continue in waves: Report||The coronavirus pandemic is likely to last as long as two years and won’t be controlled until about two-thirds of the world’s population is immune, a group of experts said in a report.Because of its ability to spread from people who don’t appear to be ill, the virus may be harder to control than influenza, the cause of most pandemics in recent history, according to the report from the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. People may actually be at their most infectious before symptoms appear, according to the report.The HT Guide to Coronavirus Covid-19After locking down billions of people around the world to minimize its spread through countries, governments are now cautiously allowing businesses and public places to reopen. Yet the coronavirus pandemic is likely to continue in waves that could last beyond 2022, the authors said.“Risk communication messaging from government officials should incorporate the concept that this pandemic will not be over soon,” they said, “and that people need to be prepared for possible periodic resurgences of disease over the next two years.”Developers are rushing to make vaccines that may be available in small quantities as early as this year. While large amounts of vaccine against the 2009-2010 flu pandemic didn’t become available until after the outbreak peaked in the U.S., one study has estimated that the shots prevented as many as 1.5 million cases and 500 deaths in that country alone, the report said.Also read | Once upon a virus’: China mocks US with video on Covid-19, Twitter hits backThe report was written by CIDRAP director Michael Osterholm and medical director Kristen Moore, Tulane University public health historian John Barry, and Marc Lipsitch, an epidemiologist at the Harvard School of Public Health.WATCH | ‘Seen proof of Covid-19 link with Wuhan lab’: Donald Trump slams China||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-pandemic-could-last-beyond-2022-likely-to-continue-in-waves-report/story-uJYedKqlN3YS22rqRjspLO.html
01-05-2020||World||Pakistani parliament’s speaker tests positive for Covid-19||The speaker of Pakistan’s National Assembly said late on Thursday that he had tested positive for Covid-19, after hosting an iftar dinner to celebrate Ramadan, and meeting Prime Minister Imran Khan and other high officials earlier in the week.It is not immediately known if Khan will be tested, but he was checked in April, and tested negative, after meeting with the head of Pakistan’s biggest charity organisation, who was subsequently confirmed to have caught the disease.The National Assembly, the lower house of parliament, is currently in recess, though opposition parties have been calling for it to convene to discuss the government’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak in the country, where the number of cases has risen to 16,817, including 385 deaths.میرا کورونا وائرس کا ٹیسٹ مثبت آیا ہے۔ میں نے خود کو اپنے گھر میں قرنطینہ کر لیا ہے۔ میری پوری قوم سے درخواست ہے کہ وہ احتیاط کریں۔دعا کی درخواست ہے۔The decision on whether to convene rested with Speaker of the Assembly, Asad Qaiser, who on Thursday night revealed he had tested positive in the capital, Islamabad.“I have quarantined myself at home,” Qaiser, who is also a close aide to Khan, said on Twitter. Qaiser met with the prime minister on Monday, and has met several other leading figures during the past few days.The speaker had hosted an Iftar, the evening meal to break fast during Ramadan, attended by politicians and dignitaries on Monday.Daily detection of the virus has hit record highs on each of the last three days as the country ramps up its testing. On Thursday, 990 people tested positive. Daily testing is still around 8,000 in the country, which has over 207 million people.The government says infections are well below projections and that it plans to further ease precautionary curbs after already opening dozens of industries and commercial activities, as well as mosque congregations.Qaiser is the second high official to be infected in Pakistan after the Governor of the southern province of Sindh, Imran Ismail, tested positive on Monday.Pakistan’s government agreed to allow mosque congregations after senior clerics and religious leaders threatened to violate restrictions during Ramadan.The two sides worked out safety protocols for the mosque gatherings, but a social research organization earlier this week reported that protocols were not being followed. Prominent doctors pleaded with the government to reconsider the decision, warning that mosque congregations, which are typically larger in Ramadan, could lead to a spike in infections, with hospitals already nearing capacity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistani-parliament-s-speaker-tests-positive-for-covid-19/story-OuifvIis2WJIQjew4Le6zH.html
01-05-2020||World||Pakistan leans on China to remove its terrorists from UNSC sanctions list||Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan’s government has approached the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) for deletion of six terrorists sanctioned by the world’s top security panel, a senior government official in Delhi told Hindustan Times.Islamabad is likely to file more requests for deletions so that these can be processed by the UNSC before the year-end.Islamabad last month told a visiting UNSC sanctions monitoring team that it could not find most terrorists sanctioned by the security council over the years because the UNSC did not have complete and accurate information about them. The team subsequently told Pakistan to file requests for deletion of the names if the entry was “inappropriate”.Already, Islamabad has only confirmed that 19 of the 130 terrorists sanctioned by the UNSC are in Pakistan. Of these 19, it has requested UNSC to remove names of 6 terrorists.Diplomats in Delhi and New York told Hindustan Times that Pakistan’s hard push to improve its track record at the UNSC is grounded in the confidence that China will back its requests. “We have not been able to figure yet if the move is in consultation with Beijing but that would not be a surprise,” one of them said.Beijing had blocked an Indian-led international effort to designate chief of the Jaish-e-Mohammad terror group Masood Azhar as a global terrorist for years. Beijing eventually had to give in last year after the Jaish was implicated in the Pulwama bombing of 40 CRPF troopers that provoked India to launch air strikes at a terror training camp in Pakistan’s Balakot.China sought to make up to Pakistan for Masood Azhar’s terror tag by its support to Islamabad’s tit-for-tat effort to get four Indian professionals working in Afghanistan designated as terrorists under the UN Security Council’s 1267 Al Qaida sanctions. The four Indians were evacuated from Afghanistan by Indian security agencies over apprehensions that Pakistan could abduct them and claim to arrest them from its territory.Just as Islamabad had done with ex-Navy officer Kulbhushan Jadhav who was abducted from Iran and turned up in custody of Pakistani security agencies, the counter-terror operative said. Sentenced to death in a secret trial that India called “premeditated murder”, Jadhav is still in a Pakistan jail despite the International Court of Justice verdict last year that asked Islamabad to have the sentence “effectively” reviewed by an independent body.News of the attempt to prune the list of Pakistani terrorists sanctioned by the UNSC 1267 committee comes weeks after it emerged that Islamabad had been quietly removing names from its domestic terror watch list. On April 20, US tech firm Castellum.AI said Pakistan had removed nearly 3,800 names from the Proscribed Persons List that it had been maintaining. About 1,800 of these names were removed from the terror watch list after 9 March.Indian diplomats are convinced that the Pakistani effort to reduce the terror watch list is linked to the meeting of the terror financing watchdog Financial Action Task Force that was scheduled for June. It has now been deferred.At this meeting, the FATF had to assess the action taken by Pakistan to decide if it should continue to be in the grey list, be placed in the black list or be let off the hook. Islamabad has been in FATF’s grey list since 2018 for not doing enough to counter the raising of funds by al-Qaeda, Taliban, Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed.Since then, it has missed several deadlines to implement the action plan that it had committed to deliver on but has successfully evaded blacklisting. Diplomats in Delhi believe this has a lot to do with Beijing’s influence. That the FATF presidency has been with China’s Xiangmin Liu since 1 July 2019 also helped get away by doing less, one of them said.For instance, of the 19 names accepted by Pakistan to be on its soil, it has convicted only two - Lashkare-Taiba founder Hafiz Saeed and associate Malik Zafar Iqbal - ahead of the last FATF plenary in mid-March, an Indian official said. Besides, it has admitted that of the 222 cases filed in the country in such terror cases, only 60 were convicted and that too, for a few days each. Since the jail term is less than FATF’s prescribed minimum jail term (one year), it demonstrates a complete lack of seriousness to meet the FATF requirements, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-pak-s-push-to-delete-its-terrorists-from-unsc-list-china-s-support-is-key/story-OTTb65xlf8k5akNibrc2cP.html

And parks are allowing people to visit at 30% of the usual capacity.Large-scale group activities remain on hold and visitors must book tickets in advance online, according to Gao Dawei, deputy director of the Beijing Gardening and Greening Bureau.Beijing on Thursday downgraded its level of emergency response to the virus from first to second tier, but temperature checks and social distancing remain in force.The change comes at the start of the five-day May 1 holiday and in advance of China’s rescheduled gathering of the National People’s Congress on May 22.The sessions were delayed from early March. The two-week annual meetings are largely ceremonial, with the legislature rubber-stamping decisions reached earlier by Communist Party leaders, but in typical years they are a colorful spectacle in the nation’s capital.It’s not yet clear if the 3,000 or so delegates would come to Beijing, or if sessions would be held virtually through videoconference.China on Friday reported 12 new cases of the virus, six of them brought from overseas, and no new deaths for the 16th day. It has reported a total of 4,633 deaths from the virus among about 83,000 cases, mostly in the central city of Wuhan.Most recent cases reported in China have been among travelers arriving from abroad or in a northeastern province near the border with Russia.Across the country, 599 patients remain under treatment for the virus. Just under 1,000 people are under medical observation because they tested positive but don’t show symptoms or have symptoms but testing hasn’t confirmed the infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/forbidden-city-parks-in-beijng-reopen-to-public-as-covid-crisis-eases/story-uZyP3XFEUxbNGIMvCf4a0J.html

01-05-2020||World||3.8 million more in US apply for jobless aid||More than 3.8 million laid-off workers applied for unemployment benefits last week as the US economy slid further into a crisis that is becoming the most devastating since the 1930s.Roughly 30.3 million people have now filed for jobless aid in the six weeks since the coronavirus outbreak began forcing millions of employers to close their doors and slash their workforces. That is more people than live in the New York and Chicago metropolitan areas combined, and it’s by far the worst string of layoffs on record. It adds up to more than one in six American workers.With more employers cutting payrolls to save money, economists have forecast that the unemployment rate for April could go as high as 20%. That would be the highest rate since it reached 25% during the Great Depression.Some outside reviews suggest that the number of job losses is likely even higher than is captured in the weekly unemployment claims. A poll by two academic economists, Alexander Bick and Adam Blandin, found that the US economy may have lost 34 million jobs since mid-March, when the coronavirus shutdowns began.A key reason for that emerges from a survey by the Economic Policy Institute. It found that up to 12 million more people have lost jobs but haven’t filed a claim for benefits, either because they couldn’t get through their state’s overwhelmed system or they didn’t try, perhaps because it was too difficult.“These findings imply the official count of unemployment insurance claims likely drastically understates the extent of employment reductions,” wrote Ben Zipperer and Elise Gould, economists at EPI.This week, the government estimated that the economy shrank at a 4.8% annual rate in the first three months of this year, the sharpest quarterly drop since the 2008 financial crisis. Yet the picture is likely to grow far worse: The economy is expected to contract in the April-June quarter by as much as 40% at an annual rate. No previous quarter has been anywhere near as weak since the government began keeping such records after World War II.States have approved the jobless benefit applications of nearly 18 million people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/3-8-million-more-in-us-apply-for-jobless-aid/story-6bEXgSMrlZhpMWCKn6MpVI.html

It has subsequently relaxed some of its social distancing guidelines and is expected to ease up on more restrictions in the coming days if the downward trend continues.South Korea had its first confirmed coronavirus case Jan. 20, the same day as the United States.But unlike the U.S., officials there used a test focused on the same gene targets as the World Health Organization’s recommended test, according to the website of a test manufacturer. The government then quickly allowed private sector labs to produce it.As a result, a nation with less than one-sixth the population of the United States mobilized to test more than 20,000 people a day. South Korea also instituted drive-through testing centers, allowing quicker identification of those who were infected but might not be displaying symptoms, thus slowing the emergence of new cases to a more manageable level.By comparison, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention decided to develop its own test, focusing on three gene targets distinct from what the WHO used. The test was reportedly flawed and according to CDC data only 472 patients had been tested nationwide on Feb. 29, with just 22 cases confirmed.The result was that while South Korea was able to manage its caseload, the rate of U.S. infections soared.Guterres said recovery from the pandemic “needs to go hand-in-hand with climate action,” just as South Korea is doing now.He called on governments to ensure that spending to revitalize their economies gives priority to the creation of “green jobs” and use of low-carbon energy sources.“Taxpayers’ money should not be used to subsidize fossil fuels or bail out polluting, carbon-intensive industries,” the U.N. chief said. “Now is the time to put a price on carbon and for polluters to pay for their pollution.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/remarkable-example-un-chief-says-world-should-follow-south-korea-on-covid-19-fight/story-WojyJDZIucGctjMeL2HdvN.html

We have an obligation to the American people to do our best to make sure that we fix that, that we prevent those things from ever happening again,” he said.Meanwhile, several Republican lawmakers demanding a Congressional hearing alleged that the WHO parroted the Chinese regime’s “disinformation” on multiple occasions, including denying human-to-human transmission of the virus.They alleged the WHO prolonged declaring Covid-19 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, chastised efforts to restrict travel, and continued to praise China as a global leader in public health despite mounting evidence to the contrary.“The WHO’s inaction and delay undoubtedly cost American lives. For these reasons, we commend the President’s decision to temporarily pause the WHO’s funding,” the lawmakers said.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage Congressman James Comer, Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on The Environment, said it would be an utter failure of the Committee to not investigate the WHO’s failures to address the worldwide Covid-19 pandemic and its effect on the American people.

In a interview on Wednesday, Trump said he believed China’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic was proof that Beijing “will do anything they can” to make him lose his re-election bid in November. Slamming Beijing for failing to contain the novel coronavirus at its origin, Trump said the virus outbreak “should have been stopped at the source, which was China. It should have been stopped very much at the source, but it wasn’t. And now we have 184 countries going through hell.” The US has also accused China of covering up the extent of its coronavirus outbreak.Also read: With Kim Jong Un’s health status unclear, his uncle suddenly relevant after 40 yrs abroad China has denied it and accused the US of attempting to divert the public attention by insinuating that the virus originated from a Wuhan lab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/on-kim-jong-un-s-health-whereabouts-un-chief-says-we-have-no-information/story-YgJoWaSozuAL1OngfEgieO.html
01-05-2020||World||Covid-19: Top US airlines make face masks mandatory throughout trips||Delta Air Lines Inc. and American Airlines Group Inc. have decided to make passengers wear face masks, adding momentum to what’s catching on as a new standard for the industry as it fights to win back customers during a pandemic.The larger carriers are following JetBlue Airways Corp., which announced April 27 that travelers would have to cover their nose and mouth throughout trips starting May 4. Delta‘s mandate starts the same day, with American’s kicking in on May 11. Small children are exempt.The requirement is meant to help soothe concerns that aircraft cabins foster the spread of Covid-19. All three airlines cited guidelines from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control in implementing the change. The coverings help prevent anyone who may be unknowingly infected with the new coronavirus from spreading it in a confined space like an airplane cabin.“We take seriously the CDC guidelines for adding this extra layer of protection,” Bill Lentsch, Delta’s chief customer experience officer, said in a statement Thursday. “We believe this change will give customers and employees some additional comfort when traveling with us.”While neither have issued a decree, United Airlines Holdings Inc. said it’s strongly encouraging the coverings, and Southwest Airlines Co. said it will provide masks to those who want them.The union representing flight attendants from 20 airlines welcomed the new rule, and urged for it to be expanded.The Association of Flight Attendants wants the federal government to mandate “masks for crew, front line employees and all passengers,” said Sara Nelson, president of the group.Lobby, TooMasks will be compulsory just on board American flights, while Delta and JetBlue are requiring them starting in the check-in lobby, gate areas, jet bridges as well as during flights.American will begin making masks and hand sanitizing wipes or gel available to some passengers on Friday, expanding to all flights as it’s able, the Fort Worth, Texas-based carrier said. Masks made at home from cloth or other household items can be used, it said.United, Delta and American already require some employees to wear face masks, or will do so soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-top-us-airlines-make-face-masks-mandatory-throughout-trips/story-cvrHapHskLWpHWOzkYprvK.html
01-05-2020||World||‘China never gave US anything, doesn’t want to see me elected’, says Donald Trump||US President Donald Trump on Thursday alleged that China does not want to see him elected in polls due later this year, mainly because of the billions of dollars he has been taking from them as import tariffs.Instead, he claimed, China wants to have former vice president Joe Biden elected as the next US president in the November elections. Biden is the presumptive nominee of the opposition Democratic party.“China doesn’t want to see me elected and the reason is that we are getting billions and billions of dollars, many billions of dollars a month from China,” Trump said, referring to the massive tariffs he has imposed on the import of Chinese products into the US.“China never gave our country anything...whether it was Biden in charge of China which was a joke because they ripped off our country for eight years and in all fairness to Biden and (former US President Barack) Obama, this went on long before they got into office,” he said.“I mean, you can go through many administrations until I came along and then we find a trade deal where they are supposed to buy and they have been buying a lot actually. But that now becomes secondary to what took place with the virus. The virus situation is just not acceptable,” Trump said.Also read: China says it has no interest in meddling in 2020 US Presidential polls “I don’t want to cast any aspersions; I just will tell you that China would like to see Sleepy Joe Biden.

However, the opposition Democratic party slammed him on his China policy.“Trump put his political fortunes first and our public health last. He refused to call out China on its coronavirus response and delayed taking action to mitigate the crisis out of fear of upsetting his trade deal that has gone largely unfulfilled. Now Americans are suffering the consequences,” Democratic National Committee deputy War Room director Daniel Wessel said in a statement.“We’d say Trump is weak on China, but that’s an understatement. Trump rolled over in a way that has been catastrophic for our country. He did nothing for months because he put himself and his political fortunes first. “He refused to push China on its coronavirus response and delayed taking action to mitigate the crisis in an effort to not upset Beijing and secure a limited trade deal that has largely gone unfulfilled,” Wessel said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-never-gave-us-anything-doesn-t-want-to-see-me-elected-says-donald-trump/story-6RdoFCtlKnoP1ztnL9UynI.html
01-05-2020||World||Covid-19: Armed US protesters enter Michigan capitol, demand lockdown end||Demonstrators, including some carrying guns, entered the capitol building in the US state of Michigan on Thursday and demanded the Democratic governor lift strict coronavirus lockdown orders, as some lawmakers reportedly donned bulletproof vests.Dozens of demonstrators crowded the lobby of the building in Lansing, where they demanded to be allowed inside the House Chamber.State police, wearing masks, blocked them from entering. None of the protesters appeared to be wearing masks.“Directly above me, men with rifles yelling at us,” tweeted Senator Dayna Polehanki along with a photo showing four men, at least one of whom appeared to be carrying a weapon.“Some of my colleagues who own bullet proof vests are wearing them. I have never appreciated our Sergeants-at-Arms more than today,” she continued.More protesters could be seen outside carrying signs, including one depicting Governor Gretchen Whitmer as Adolf Hitler.The demonstration, dubbed the American Patriot Rally, was organized by a group calling itself Michigan United for Liberty.“We do not agree with or consent to our unalienable rights being restricted or rescinded for any reason, including the COVID-19 pandemic,” the group said on its private Facebook page, where it has more than 8,800 members.“We believe that every American and every Michigander has the right to work to support our families, to travel freely, to gather for religious worship and for other purposes, to gather in protest of our government and to direct our own medical care.”The protest comes a day after a Michigan court ruled that stay-at-home directives issued by Whitmer on March 24 do not infringe on residents’ constitutional rights, according to local media reports.It was the second time this month that protesters have demanded Whitmer lift lockdown restrictions in the state, which has seen more than 3,500 people killed by the coronavirus, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.On April 16 around 3,000 protesters, some of them also armed, descended on Lansing for “Operation Gridlock,” causing a massive traffic jam around the capital building.A day later Trump appeared to lend his support to them and scattered protests elsewhere, tweeting “LIBERATE MICHIGAN!”Whitmer, whose name has emerged as a potential running mate for presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, shrugged those protests off, telling CNN it was “OK to be angry.”“I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again -- Michigan is an extraordinary place to live because of the people who call it home. There are millions of Michiganders doing their part to slow the spread of #COVID19 every single day. We are going to get through this together,” she tweeted later Thursday, without commenting directly on the protests.Despite the demonstrations, Whitmer’s handling of the virus crisis has been met with a generally favorable response.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-armed-us-protesters-enter-michigan-capitol-demand-lockdown-end/story-AxFqblSSOpH2Zc3tY1hlTN.html
01-05-2020||World||Donald Trump says evidence ties China lab to coronavirus, threatens tariffs||US President Donald Trump on Thursday threatened China with fresh tariffs as he stepped up his attacks on Beijing over the coronavirus crisis, saying he had seen evidence linking a Wuhan lab to the contagion.The diatribe from the Republican incumbent came as data showed the United States shed more than 30 million jobs in six weeks, as lockdown measures began to bite across the nation.The gloom in the world’s largest economy found its parallel across the Atlantic, where experts warned of an unprecedented financial catastrophe in Europe.The outbreak of the novel coronavirus has so far killed more than 230,000 people and forced more than half of humanity to live under some kind of lockdown, which has crippled economies.The virus is believed to have originated late last year in a market in the Chinese city of Wuhan that sold wild animals for human consumption, but speculation has swirled about a top-secret lab in the ground-zero city.Asked if he had seen anything giving him a high degree of confidence that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was the source of the outbreak, Trump replied, “Yes, I have.”Pressed by reporters at the White House for details on what made him so confident, Trump replied: “I cannot tell you that.”Trump is increasingly making Beijing’s handling of the outbreak a major issue for his November re-election campaign.When asked about reports that he could cancel US debt obligations to China, Trump said he could “do it differently” and act in “probably a little bit more of a forthright manner.”“I could do the same thing but even for more money, just putting on tariffs,” he said.Despite a truce in the long-running trade war between Washington and Beijing reached in January, tariffs are already in place on two-thirds of trade between the economic powers.- Eurozone gloom -European and US markets finished the day in negative territory, as a spate of figures confirmed fears about how the COVID-19 crisis is pulverizing global growth.The latest jobless claims by another 3.84 million Americans translate into a jarring conclusion -- roughly nine percent of the US population has filed for unemployment benefits in six weeks.In the midwestern US state of Michigan, protesters -- some of them armed -- stormed the state capitol building, demanding that the Democratic governor remove strict lockdown rules, which they say hurt the economy and represent governmental overreach.The depressing US jobs data compounded the tough message from European Central Bank Christine Lagarde.“The euro area is facing an economic contraction of a magnitude and speed that are unprecedented in peacetime,” she warned.ECB economists expect output in the 19-nation currency club to shrink by “five to 12 percent” this year, she added.Eurostat figures showed the eurozone economy was estimated to have shrunk by 3.8 percent in the first quarter.Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, “will experience the worst recession in the history of the federal republic” -- founded in 1949 -- Economy Minister Peter Altmaier warned, predicting it would shrink by a record 6.3 percent.- Drug trial boosts hopes -The coronavirus virus has infected at least 3.2 million people so far, with Russia’s Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin becoming the latest high-profile figure to test positive as the country’s caseload surged past 100,000.But there was some reason for cheer.American scientists reported positive tests for an improved treatment, and with deaths and infections starting to drop in some hotspots, countries looked at the next phase in their plans to lift crippling lockdown measures.On Thursday, Germany accelerated plans to start lifting its anti-virus lockdown, preparing to ease curbs on public life and reopen religious institutions, museums and zoos -- having restarted shopping last week.A decision on when to reopen schools is to come next week.“It remains absolutely important that we stay disciplined,” said Chancellor Angela Merkel.In South Korea, where COVID-19 was detected in mid-February, no new infections were reported for the first time, suggesting its aggressive test-and-trace strategy is working. South Korea’s death toll is around 250 -- vastly lower than that of Italy, Britain, Spain and France, which have each recorded at least 24,000 fatalities. The United States tops the table with more than 62,000 deaths.Italy, once the world center of the outbreak, said Thursday it was hoping to reopen two major airports next week, but -- like Spain -- plans a cautious reopening.“We cannot allow the efforts made to be in vain because of rashness at this delicate stage,” Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said. And British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who himself battled COVID-19, said the country was “past the peak” of its outbreak.- ‘Clear-cut effect’ - Meanwhile, in the first evidence of successful treatment, a US clinical trial of the drug remdesivir showed that patients recovered about 30 percent faster than those on a placebo.“The data shows that remdesivir has a clear-cut, significant, positive effect in diminishing the time to recovery,” said Anthony Fauci, the top epidemiologist in the United States.But it is a treatment, not the much-sought-after vaccine that might allow a full return to normal life. More than 130 virus therapies are currently being investigated, the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations said Thursday.Most are still in the early stages of testing, but more than 25 clinical trials have begun, IFPMA director Thomas Cueni said. burs-sst/ec||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-says-evidence-ties-china-lab-to-coronavirus-threatens-tariffs/story-umlIzx5fIMjOXkWKTU0uPJ.html
01-05-2020||World||Dead virus particles may affect test result||Coronavirus patients who remain positive weeks after diagnosis may harbour dead virus particles that can’t be distinguished from infectious ones in tests, scientists in South Korea found.The virus dies one to two weeks after infecting and proliferating inside respiratory cells, doctors at the National Medical Center in Seoul said. Pieces of the virus’s RNA may remain in cells and be detected by a nucleic acid test a month or two after infection, underscoring the limitation of Covid-19 testing, they said.Some Covid-19 patients have continued to test positive over more than a month, said Peter Collignon, a professor of clinical medicine at the Australian National University Medical School in Canberra. It’s possible that the virus detected in these patients isn’t viable or capable of causing an infection, “but we need better animal models to see if it’s dead or alive,” he said. How long an individual excretes infectious virus in their respiratory secretions and faecal matter is key to determining the optimal time an infected person should self-isolate or be quarantined. Previous studies indicate that very ill patients remain infectious longer than people who experience a mild illness.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dead-virus-particles-may-affect-test-result/story-KwnqDfVCiutYbJFr2NiDUM.html
01-05-2020||World||World may see unprecedented 8% fall in CO2 emissions: IEA||The coronavirus lockdown will cause the biggest drop in energy demand in history -the equivalent of the entire energy demand of India - with only renewables managing to increase output through the crisis. As people around the world consume less oil, gas and coal, electricity generated from the wind and sun will keep flowing, resulting in an unprecedented 8% decline in global carbon dioxide emissions this year, according to a report from the International Energy Agency (IEA). “The energy industry that emerges from this crisis will be significantly different from the one that came before,” Fatih Birol, the IEA’s executive director, said in a statement released on Thursday.The pandemic has infected at least 3.2mn people worldwide and killed more than 229,000. With no drug to treat Covid-19 and a vaccine not expected until at least the end of the year, reducing the interactions between infected people is the only effective way to control the spread.Those measures, however, have severe impact on economic growth and energy demand. Each month of lockdown on the scale of what’s in place this month reduces annual energy demand by 1.5%, the IEA estimates.The institution says demand is likely to fall 6% in 2020, which is seven times the scale of the drop suffered in the 2008 financial crisis. Rich countries will show a steeper decline, with the US falling 9% and the EU losing 11%.While all sources of energy - oil, coal, natural gas and nuclear - will see a decline, renewable energy is likely to be the bright spot. And though emissions will fall drastically, the IEA expects a sharp rebound without government policies pushing for a green recovery. With fossil-fuel use taking a big hit, it’s no surprise that emissions will fall. An 8% decline is larger than most early estimates, and bigger than what the most ambitious scenario to keep global warming under check demands. Yet, that decline probably is not enough to hold off further increases in the earth’s temperature or the stock of greenhouse gases that have built up in the atmosphere, the IEA said. The more ambitious target set under the Paris climate agreement - keeping temperature rise below 1.5 degrees Celsius - will require halving annual global emissions by 2030 and hitting net-zero emissions sometime around the middle of the century. Without deep structural changes, emissions are expected to rise again when economies recover.“Governments can learn from that experience by putting clean energy technologies at the heart of their plans for economic recovery,” Birol said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-may-see-unprecedented-8-fall-in-co2-emissions-iea/story-2Kj35kMSaD2Kbbau0VSnnI.html
01-05-2020||India||In highest single-day spike, India records 2,364 cases, more than 1,000 in Maharashtra||India recorded the highest single-day spike in Covid-19 infections with 2,364 cases on Friday, the first time the country has reported more than 2,000 daily cases of the disease that first showed up in Kerala more than three months ago. Almost half of Friday’s caseload came from Maharashtra, which reported 1,008 cases. This is also the first time that the state, which has been pummelled by the contagion, has reported more than 1,000 cases.The previous highest daily count was 1,907 cases that was reported on April 28, also the day India crossed 30,000 Covid-19 cases. Despite the rise, the government continued to express confidence in strict containment measures and said it had sufficient supplies of medical equipment, drugs and ventilators to tackle any surge in demand.An analysis by HT showed that the country averaged a daily number of 1,836 new cases every day in the past seven days, up from 1436 the week before. After Maharashtra, which has the highest share of infections in the country, the biggest chunks of cases came from Gujarat (326) and Delhi (223). The total cases in India stood at 37,259, the number of deaths at 1,221 and the number of those recovered at 9,874.Despite the steady rise in the number of cases, the doubling rate – the number of days it takes for a given number of infections to double – has been steadily rising, a sign that the government has been able to contain the rapid spread of the disease. It stood at 11.7 days on Thursday, up from around four at the beginning of the month.But on Friday, the doubling rate slightly decreased to 11.5 days – the first time since April 5 that the number has gone down.In Maharashtra, the state capital of Mumbai recorded 751 cases – the highest one-day jump for the city that accounts for roughly two-thirds of all infections in the state. The total number of cases for the city stands at 7,812 and that for the state is at 11,506.State government officials said 399 of the 1,008 positives were from tests conducted between April 25 and 28, and were added to Friday’s tally after verification.While 106 patients were discharged on Friday upon recovery, 26 patients died, the Maharashtra health department said.The death toll reached 485 and number of discharged patients was 1,879, officials added.Ten deaths were recorded in Pune city, five in Mumbai, three is Jalgaon district and one each Pune district, Sindhudurg, Bhiwandi, Thane, Nanded, Aurangabad and Parbhani during the day. Besides, a resident of Uttar Pradesh died in Mumbai during treatment for virus infection. 15 of 26 patients who died had high-risk comorbidities (existing health issues), the statement said.Globally, the total number of cases topped 3.36 million, almost a third of which are from the United States. The US recorded 16,500 daily cases as of Friday night, followed by Spain at 3,648 and Italy at 1,965. The total number of cases in the three countries stand at 1,111,510, 242,988 and 207,428, respectively.(with inputs from agencies and HTC, Mumbai)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-records-2-364-cases-in-a-day-more-than-1k-in-maha/story-AMpiOGrqOKLh0qjwXQxsmM.html
01-05-2020||India||Influenza pandemics may hold clue for Covid outbreak||Scientists at the Centre for Infectious Disease Research and Policy in the United States have offered some clues about how the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic may evolve based on the experience and trajectories of previous influenza pandemics, four of which occurred in the last century.The analysis, which maps out three distinct trajectories the Covid-19 outbreak can take, focuses on the northern hemisphere and developed countries but cautions that the impact in the so-called global south or developing countries could be worse, given the high population density and inadequate health infrastructure.The scientists posited two key takeaways from comparisons with the influenza pandemics. The first that the outbreak may stretch to 18-24 months as immunity slowly builds up in the population. “Given the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 [that causes Covid-19], 60% to 70% of the population may need to be immune to reach a critical threshold of herd immunity to halt the pandemic,” the report said.The other takeaway summarized three possible trajectories for the pandemic. The first of these sees the first wave of Covid-19 in spring 2020 and followed by smaller waves of the disease over the next year before finally diminishing in 2021. “Depending on the height of the wave peaks, this scenario could require periodic reinstitution and subsequent relaxation of mitigation measures over the next 1 to 2 years,” the study found.The second scenario sees a second wave follow the first wave in the fall or winter of 2021 and smaller subsequent waves in 2021. “This pattern will require the reinstitution of mitigation measures in the fall,” the study said. This pattern is similar to the 1918-19 influenza pandemicThe third scenario showed the first wave of Covid-19 in spring 2020 followed by a “slow burn” of ongoing transmission and case occurrence but without a clear peak.“Whichever scenario the pandemic follows, we must be prepared for at least another 18 to 24 months of significant Covid-19 activity, with hot spots popping up periodically in diverse geographic areas. As the pandemic wanes, it is likely that SARS-CoV-2 will continue to circulate in the human population and will synchronize to a seasonal pattern with diminished severity over time,” the scientists wrote.The study cautioned that while the Covid-19 and influenza pandemics had similarities, there were important differences.Both diseases are caused by viruses that are spread predominantly via the respiratory and aerosol route and to which human beings have no pre-existing immunity. Both diseases see asymptomatic transmissions and are capable of rapid infections.The two pathogens differed in the incubation period (2-14 days for Sars-CoV-2 and 1-4 days for influenza), the percentage of asymptomatic patients (higher for Sars-Cov-2), and significant pre-symptomatic transmission of Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/influenza-pandemics-may-hold-clue-for-covid-outbreak/story-wIHg6m3vmtEhUekaXopcaI.html
01-05-2020||India||India to sequence 1,000 genomes to understand Covid-19 virus||The Department of Biotechnology (DBT) has undertaken a project to sequence 1,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from samples to understand the evolving behaviour of the virus that causes the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The samples will be collected from across India to study the emerging mutations in the virus and how they change the symptoms of the infections disease that has killed at least 235,000 people across the world.“The project started out as a consortium of DBT institutes, but now a couple of other nationally reputed institutes have also come forward. The objective is to have as much genomic data in one place as possible. We will not limit it to 1,000 but can do as many as possible. This data on the virus and its interaction in the Indian population will feed into other DBT and government programmes working to develop diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics,” said Dr Suchita Ninawe, senior scientist with DBT.The analysis of the data will also help the researchers understand how genetic variations in the human host relate to the severity and transmissibility of the infection and the susceptibility to it.“This is essentially a pan-Indian consortium on Covid-19 genomics. What we are trying to do is collect sequences from different regions of India. This will help us track the virus and how it has evolved across India. What we are trying to see is the differences in the viral RNA sequence of the virus circulating in different zones of India,” said Dr Saumitra Das, director, National Institute of Biomedical Genomics (NIBMG) in Kalyani, West Bengal.The institute has already sequenced about five Sars-CoV-2 genomes.The study will be coordinated by NIBMG along with the primary partners Centre for DNA Fingerprinting And Diagnostics – Hyderabad, Institute of Life Sciences – Bhubaneswar, National Centre for Cell Science – Pune, Institute For Stem Cell Science and Regenerative Medicine – Bengaluru. Other DBT laboratories will also contribute in sample collection and sequencing from across the country. The Indian Institute of Sciences is also likely to join the project.Apart from the primary centres, 10 other DBT institutes will help in the project.“Apart from that, we will also be able to correlate the sequence variation to the disease severity and the transmission efficiency of the virus. This will have to be validated in cell culture models to understand whether the mutations change the functions of the virus. Second thing is to understand how will the same virus impact people living in different zones, meaning what is the role of the genetic makeup of the human host,” said Dr Das.According to researchers, the methodology is already in place and the sequencing of the 1,000 genomes should take about two months. “The major hurdle right now is the availability of these sequencing kits because of the global lockdowns. The sequencing of 1,000 genomes should take about two months, but it will take longer to analyse the data coming in from various laboratories across the country,” said Dr Das.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-to-sequence-1-000-genomes-to-understand-covid-19-virus/story-QwV3xAIkQJAlpXm6kCZKjO.html
01-05-2020||India||India must consider ways to get access to remdesivir: Nirmal K Ganguly||The antiviral drug, remdesivir, emerged as the first successful treatment against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) after a US government-funded trial on 1,063 people found it could effectively block the virus and boost recovery. “The data shows remdesivir has a clear-cut, significant, positive effect in diminishing the time to recovery,” said US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) director Dr Anthony Fauci, who likened the finding to the first retrovirals that worked with modest success against HIV in the 1980s.The US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) is expected to announce an emergency-use authorization for use of remdesivir to treat patients.Remdesivir is an experimental antiviral drug developed by the US-based pharma major Gilead Sciences. It failed in trials against the Ebola virus and was found to have limited effects among patients in Wuhan, China, where the illness was first detected last year.Dr Nirmal K Ganguly, emeritus scientist and former director general of Indian Council of Medical Research, has gone through the findings of the soon to be published NIAID trial. He spoke to Sanchita Sharma over the phone on what these finding means for India.Remdesivir has failed several trials in the past. How effective is it against Covid-19?The world finally has a drug against Covid-19, but it will not be a public health tool as it has to be given intravenously to hospitalized patients to hasten recovery.The drug was originally created as a pan-viral drug to treat RNA viruses, Marburg and Ebola, but it was not successful. In later trials, it has also been investigated for action against all coronaviruses, including those that cause Sars [Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome], Mers (Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome), and now Covid-19 as well as it worked against animal coronaviruses. It was found to be clinically fulfilling Lipinski’s Rule [which give the probability of the success of a drug] and was found to work on viral replication in respiratory epithelial cells, which are the first target of infection. It does not promote mutation.The NIAID study has confirmed its effectiveness in hastening recovery, and Gilead now plans to expand trials to include 5,600 patients in seven countries. India does not figure in the list.However, it was not licensed in any country in the world. The USFDA has now recommended its use as an emergency drug. A small study done by Dr Aruna Subramanian, a clinical professor of medicine and infectious diseases at Stanford University School of Medicine in California, also found 50% patients given 5 mg of the drug improved in 10 days, and 60.6% were discharged in 14 days.If remdesivir gets the USFDA nod, will India consider using it to treat Covid-19 patients?Results from the NIAID preliminary trial show remdesivir reduced recovery time for Covid-19 patients from 15 to 11 days, which is similar to the effect that influenza drugs like Tamiflu, which don’t cure patients quickly, but help them recover.The NIAID trial used the drug for five days and 10 days in patients with pneumonia who needed oxygen, but did not need ventilator support at that given moment. The impact on death give a trend of 4% advantage, but this result was not statistically significant, the trend was visible.The first dose was 200 mg, followed 100 mg a day, give intravenously to hospitalised patients, with one group given the drug for five days and the other for 10 days. A significant number of patients given remdesivir did not have to go on ventilator support, and at least 30% fewer patients needed ventilation. There was clear advantage of reduction in hospital stay, with patients given the drug being discharged in 10-14 days. Five days of therapy was as effective as 10 days, which is a critical advantage in terms of reducing hospital stay, cost of medication and risk of severe adverse events [side effects]. Should India consider using remdesivir to treat patients?Gilead Sciences is reported to have drugs to treat 1.2 lakh patients, and now plans to expand trials to many countries, excluding India. Available data shows it is one of the foremost potential drugs against the disease, and since the supply is limited, according to Gilead, India must plan to get access remdesivir.In this emergency situation, the USFDA has announced emergency use authorisation. India must consider ways to make this drug available to its population. In the past, India saved millions by providing affordable and effective anti-retroviral drugs to treat HIV and AIDS, not just to its own population, but also to other countries who needed them, including to many countries in Africa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-must-consider-ways-to-get-access-to-remdesivir-nirmal-k-ganguly/story-aFjSJwEpEeudDzZWLfsrcK.html
01-05-2020||India||8 housing colonies reopened in Ghaziabad, downgraded to orange zone||The Ghaziabad district administration on Friday opened eight residential societies after no Covid-19 case was reported in 14 days there, officials said. The eight housing societies include Gyan Khand, Shipra Sun City of Indirapuram Ward No. 2, Ghaziabad Nagar Nigam; Shalimar Garden Extension-2 Sahibabad, Sector-6 Vaishali; Khatu Shyam Colony, Duhai village (Delhi-Meerut road) and Oxy Homez, Bhopura Loni Road, Sahibabad. District Magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey told PTI that the new set of guidelines issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs has downgraded the area from red zone to orange zone. The district has been kept in the orange zone because of its decreasing number of Covid-19 cases. In case coronavirus cases increase in future, the district would again reach the red zone and no relaxation would be provided in lockdown that has been extended for another two weeks from May 4. Meanwhile, a woman died of heart failure on Wednesday evening at a private hospital after being admitted for treatment of high blood pressure, diabetes and infection in the stomach, Chief Medical Officer Dr N K Gupta said. She was kept on ventilator support but could not be rescued. Her blood samples were sent for Covid-19 test that came out positive. The post-mortem report has confirmed that the woman had died due to heart failure, Gupta said. Till date, 66 coronavirus positive cases have been reported out of whom 44 patients have recovered, the CMO added.

What about it? Godi Media? They will not show you the works of humanity done by these heroes,” the senior official had tweeted.According to sources, the tweet received adverse coverage and this fact was also noted by the government.“At a time when the state government under Chief Minister Yediyurappa is leading a fight against Covid-19 by taking all sections along, it is better that officers not make remarks which are political in nature or can create disharmony,” said the senior official quoted earlier.The state government, has therefore, issued a show cause asking the officer to explain his comments on social media.The Tablighi Jamaat has been in the midst of a controversy during the Covid-19 outbreak as a gathering of its leaders in Delhi allegedly led to several people getting infected across the country.The organization has, however, claimed that it is cooperating in various ways to fight the pandemic.According to the official, Mohsin has been asked to explain in writing in within five days why his remarks should not be seen as violation of the All India Service Conduct rules. Mohsin, who is presently posted as a secretary in the Backward Classes Welfare Department was not available for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-govt-issues-show-cause-notice-to-ias-officer-for-tweet-on-tablighi-jamaat-members/story-WiAogvokbJYbmIhod3bgMM.html

The government considers the App to be a handy coronavirus containment tool which can be used to assess the level of risk an individual is exposed to viz a viz Covid-19 infection. The App, developed by the ministry of electronics and information technology (MEITY), uses cell phone tracking technology to put individuals in low-risk, moderate and high-risk categories by tracing if the person came in contact with a virus-infected patient or a person suspected to be infected. The government notification released on May 1, which announced the extension of the national lockdown by another two weeks beginning May 4, divides the 733 districts across the country into three zones—Red, Orange and Green—based on the risk of further spread of the virus and specifies graded restrictions for each of the zones. Most restrictions apply to Red Zones that house Containment Zones or virus hotspots, which have to face the maximum restrictions including on movement outside one’s home.“The most sensitive areas of the country, from the spread of COVID-19 point of view, and falling within the Red and Orange Zones, are designated as Containment Zones. These are areas where there is a significant risk of spread of the infection.,” says the government notification.The compulsory use of Aarogya Setu application will help the authorities monitor the status of each individual in the containment zone from a distance and will allow it to take necessary and timely action including quarantining or home isolation of suspected cases, if necessary.“The local authority shall ensure 100% coverage of Aarogya Setu app among the residents of the Containment Zone,” the latest government guidelines state.It also makes it clear that the Containment Zones would see the implementation of additional surveillance protocols including contact tracing, house to house surveillance and home or institutional quarantining.“Strict perimeter control would need to be ensured, so that there is no movement of people in and out of these Zones, except for medical emergencies, and for maintaining the supply of essential goods and services. No other activity is permitted within the Containment Zones,” the latest notification says. It adds that the containment areas would be defined by respective district administrations taking into account the total number of active cases, their geographical spread, and the need for well-demarcated perimeters for the enforcement of containment measures, says the government.ALSO READ: Red Zone classification with the list of activities permitted and prohibited during Lockdown 3.0The application in Containment Zone is the second instance of the government’s use of the Aarogya Setu App as a necessary containment tool. Earlier, a news agency reported that it had instructed all government staff to download the App and check their risk status every day before reporting to work. They were advised to not report to work if the App indicates that they are in the moderate or the high-risk category.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesThe App will continue to play an important role in the containment efforts as all government offices will resume work from May 4 with limited manpower—up to 33% of the total strength, barring senior officials who will be required to be present in full strength.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lockdown-3-0-arogya-setu-app-made-mandatory-in-containment-zones-government-offices/story-Me7wOm2mLFQszDnYUFxrHP.html

In his Facebook post, the CM said although it is a big relief, the state will continue its vigil in coming days.Though two districts, Kannur in north Kerala and Kottayam in central Kerala, are in red zone, the state has been showing a steady progress in last few days. On Thursday, it had reported only two cases. The CM Vijayan said out of 497 positive cases, 392 were discharged, leaving 102 people in the hospitals still recovering. The state had reported four deaths, but it is yet to include the death of a man from Mahe in the state list. Mahe falls between Kannur and Kozhikode districts, and is part of Pondicherry.The number of people under observation also came down to 21,499. “It is a good for day for the state. Besides reporting zero cases nine persons have discharged from the hospital. We hope things will improve in coming days. But it is too early to lower our guard,” said state health minister K K Shailaja.State chief secretary Tom Jose earlier in the day said the state has no plan to resume public transport. “We will go only step by step. The state’s progress is not permanent as of now. It can change any day. We have no plan to start public transport. We will go by a staggered opening,” he said. Kerala was the first state in the country to report a coronavirus case in January last, who was a China-returned medical student. Cases increased in March first week when people started returning from middle-eastern countries and Europe. At one point , the state was leading in cases but after Nizamuddin conference imbroglio, numbers in other states shot up. In terms of mortality and recovery rates, the state is showing a good progress, statistics tell. But its fingers are crossed as more than 2 lakh immigrant people from the state are expected to return after May 3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/first-time-since-nationwide-lockdown-kerala-sees-no-new-covid-19-case/story-MGdHymJQjfZPXvfIc3ZFnN.html

The home ministry on Friday evening extended the lockdown due to lapse on May 3 midnight by another two weeks.Officials said treating the district as a unit was unfair to the people of the city and the Centre should take a smaller unit.“The North-East Delhi District, the country’s most densely populated district, is spread over 56 square kilometers. It is unreasonable to count the entire district as one unit and place it under a continued lockdown because there were some clusters of Covid-19,” an official said.Also read | National lockdown extended by 2 weeks but restrictions eased. What it means“I think the Centre should give Delhi a break.. It is unfair,” he added.He reasoned that if the Centre continues to use the same parameter, it would be months before Delhi moves into the green zone.The city government believes a better strategy would be to demarcate the city into municipal wards - there are 272 wards under the three municipal corporations besides the NDMC and Delhi Cantonment Board - and count a ward as red, green or orange zone depending on the number of cases.When the zones system was launched last month, these were initially divided on the basis of cumulative cases and the rate of doubling of cases. “This time, we have broadened the criteria. The areas have been labelled also keeping in mind the fact these should not become potential hot spots if relaxations are given as per the green zone criteria.This implies that some places may be in the green zone but were still designated as orange or red due to their proximity to areas where the case load is high.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/give-delhi-a-break-govt-may-ask-centre-to-tweak-red-zone-rule-for-capital/story-O71e4lzb22bE0EBH8qg6LO.html

Though many of them belong to the same village, the locals did not allow them to be amidst us, unless they undergo quarantine for two weeks,” Srikakulam collector J Nivas told Hindustan Times.The authorities tried to convince the local villagers that all the migrants had undergone tests for Covid-19 and they had tested negative, the villagers were not convinced. They told the authorities that they would not allow the returnee migrant workers into the village and stay amidst them.They demanded that the migrants be kept elsewhere in the quarantine centres for two weeks before bringing them into the village. The arguments led to clashes and the police had to do mild lathi-charge to disperse the agitated villagers.“The situation is under control now. We have managed to convince them and keep the migrant workers in the local school,” the collector said.Srikakulam had been a Corona-free district till recently, but suddenly witnessed three positive cases on a single day on April 25, triggering panic among the people. Till Friday, the district has recorded five positive cases for Covid-19.“Perhaps, the people of Srikakulam have become cautious after the surfacing of positive cases in the district and hence have been resisting people coming from outside,” Nivas said.Thousands of construction workers, fishermen and other manual labourers from Srikakulam had migrated to different states. “We have started making efforts to bring all of them back to their native places in the district. We will conduct tests for all of them and send them to their destinations only if they test positive. Otherwise, we shall keep them in quarantine centres,” the collector said.On Thursday, a 53-year-old woman, who had walked for more than 120 km to return to her house in Srikakulam from Raigadh in neighbouring Odisha state, had to undergo similar trauma.Vavilapalli Lakshmi, a maid servant, had gone to her relatives’ place in Raighad on March 22 and got stuck there because of the sudden announcement of lockdown. After desperately waiting for over a month for the lockdown to be lifted, she started on foot from Raighad and after four days of marathon walk, she reached her house at Gujarathipet colony in Srikakulam town.But local residents did not allow Lakshmi to enter her house though she pleaded with them, saying she had obtained a medical certificate that showed that she had tested negative for Covid-19. She underwent the tests again on their insistence and tested negative again; yet, they refused and insisted that she be quarantined for 14 days.The hapless woman took shelter in the gram panchayat office and on Thursday, the local officials escorted her and left her at her home. “We warned the locals against harassing her. The issue is resolved now,” the collector said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/returning-migrant-workers-not-allowed-to-enter-in-andhra-s-srikakulam/story-MXVKNyy7U2unFXZLFVMgYN.html

The fare includes price of regular sleeper class tickets plus superfast charges of Rs 30 and an additional charge of Rs 20. This will include meals and drinking water for long distance trains.However, the state governments can pay on passenger’s behalf, said the railways ministry. “Passengers need not buy anything from the railways. State governments will coordinate and pay on their behalf,” the railways said.Thousands of migrants were stranded in places across the country since the lockdown was enforced on March 25, many even attempting to walk home hundreds of kilometres away.The railways also clarified that these are special trains planned for nominated people identified and registered by state governments. “No one under any circumstance should come to Railway station looking for trains. We will not issue any tickets to any individual or entertain any request from any group or individual. We will allow only those passengers to board whom state government officials will bring to railway stations. “State government is the final authority to decide that who will travel in our trains,” a railways spokesperson said.  Earlier today, the home ministry, after persistent requests from the states, allowed the railways to run special trains to bring home students and migrant workers stuck across the country due to the nationwide lockdown in place. These special trains will be run from point to point on the request of both the concerned State governments for sending and receiving such stranded persons.The first such service was run with 1,200 passengers from Hyderabad to Jharkhand at 4:50 am on Friday.The passengers will be screened by the sending states and only those found asymptomatic would be allowed to travel.It will be mandatory for every passenger to wear masks. Meals and drinking water would be provided to the passengers by the sending states at the originating station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/railways-to-charge-for-tickets-on-special-trains-to-ferry-migrant-workers-home/story-OERvorxoBf0cDrnfCJvhWN.html
01-05-2020||India||92 districts removed, 52 new ones added to red zone list; every third Indian lives in a red zone||Government has removed 92 districts from the 170 it classified as Covid-19 hotspots, or red zones, on April 15 and added 52 new districts to the list, which now leaves 130 red zone districts in the country. These 130 districts are home to a third of the country’s population and cover a fifth of the geographical area, a Hindustan Times analysis of 2011 Census data shows. Nearly 400 million people live in these hotspots, which are spread across 22 states and Union territories, but only four states are home to more than half of them.Restrictions are unlikely to be eased in these districts when the present nationwide lockdown ends On May 3.The government had on April 15 listed 170 districts as Coronavirus disease hotspots, those which had large outbreaks or multiple clusters of cases. The list has now been updated, according to a letter sent by the Union health secretary Preeti Sudan to all states and Union territories. It has now classified only 130 districts out of the country’s 733 districts as red zones. This list is valid for a week after May 3, when the nationwide lockdown is scheduled to end, and will be revised later.There are quite a few differences between the list of red zones shared on April 15 and now. Even as the total number of red zone districts has decreased by 40, seven states have seen a rise in the number. West Bengal saw the highest rise, from four to 10. Tamil Nadu saw the biggest fall in the number of such districts – out of the 22 districts earlier classified as red zones, 13 have now been removed while three new districts have been added to the list, making the new tally 12. The 400 million people in the 130 red zones live in more than 83 million households across nearly 2,500 towns and 1,20,000 villages. These comprise a third of all towns and a fifth of all inhabited villages in the country, according to the Census data.To be sure, this is a close approximation for present times because the population figures would have changed since the Census was last conducted, and some district boundaries have also changed since then.Another interesting fact is that the 14 most densely populated districts in India, according to the 2011 Census, have been classified as red zones. These include eight districts of Delhi, two districts of Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Hyderabad and Chandigarh, all big urban clusters. Out of the 50 districts that have the highest population density, 25 have been classified as red zones.Among all states and Union territories, Delhi is the only one fully classified as a red zone, other than Chandigarh which is a single district Union Territory. After Delhi, West Bengal has the highest share of districts in red zones – 10 out of the total 23 districts, or 43%. Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh follow with nearly 39% districts being red zones. In terms of absolute numbers, Uttar Pradesh has the highest number of red zone districts – 19 out of 75 – followed by 14 districts in Maharashtra (out of 36 districts) and 12 districts of Tamil Nadu (out of 37 districts).Although the red zones are spread across large geographical areas, cutting across state boundaries, more than half of the people living in these red zones are in just four states – Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh. Put together, 215 million people live in red zones in these four states, which is 54% of the total 400 million people in the red zones in India.Also, there are no red zone districts in 14 states and Union territories. These include 10 states – Goa, Himachal Pradesh and all eight states of the northeast – and four Union territories – Puducherry, Lakshadweep, Ladakh and Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu.The new list of red zones will come handy for states as the country heads towards the end of the second phase of nationwide lockdown and to better handle evacuation of millions of migrant workers and students stranded in other states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/92-districts-removed-52-new-ones-added-to-red-zone-list-every-third-indian-lives-in-a-red-zone/story-i8BLZZ1ZdNrjejBQYKOWrO.html

The 24-bogey train would run non-stop for 1,836 kilometres,” said Asit Tripathy, chief secretary, Odisha. “Those who’re coming by this train have paid the base fare of Rs 430. It’s mandatory for each passenger to wear a mask. Social distancing norm and hygiene are being strictly enforced during the journey,” Tripathy added.The Shramik Special trains are the central government’s initiative to move stranded migrant workers, students, pilgrims, tourists, and other people from different parts of the country amid the ongoing lockdown restrictions.Over the last two days, 325 migrant workers from Gujarat’s Surat have arrived in Odisha’s Ganjam district on seven buses. Another 70 students, who were stranded in Rajasthan’s Kota, the country’s coaching hub for medical and engineering aspirants, have left for Odisha in a special bus, while 1,000 more are on their way back home.The influx of people to the state comes amid Odisha reporting 149 Covid-19 positive cases, and half of them had a travel history to hotspots in neighbouring West Bengal. At present, there are 93 active Covid-19 cases in the state and one person has died so far.On Friday, two new Covid-19 positive cases were reported from the state’s Bolangir district and both the infected persons had a travel history to Tamil Nadu, another hotspot.The state government is apprehending another wave of Covid-19 positive cases, as it braces for the influx of six-lakh-odd migrant workers.Earlier in April, Odisha faced a similar challenge after a section of the followers of the Islamic sect Tablighi Jamaat, who had gone to attend the international congregation held at Nizamuddin in New Delhi between March 13 and 15, returned home, leading to the first wave of Covid-19 positive cases in the state.The Jamaat attendees have proved to be super-spreaders of SARS-CoV-2, which causes Covid-19, across the country.The chief secretary said that adequate precautions were taken to prevent the spread of the infection, as the state prepares for the influx migrant workers. Each of the 1,200 people was screened prior to boarding the train and only those found asymptomatic were allowed to travel, he said.Odisha government has also asked its counterparts to share the medical history of each and every person entering the state via 11 designed checkpoints.State health department officials said that after the migrant workers from rural areas return home, they would have to undergo a compulsory 14-day quarantine in 7,000 makeshift medical facilities, which are equipped with 2.6 lakh beds. The state government would allow home quarantine for transgender, pregnant women, or those with physical and mental disabilities.The migrant workers from urban areas would also be allowed to be home quarantined unless they themselves insist on staying in official quarantine facilities. The state has around 40,000 quarantine beds in urban areas.“We’d also allowing paid quarantine facilities in designated hotels and lodges,” the chief secretary said.“People staying at home or official quarantines would be stamped with indelible ink on their right hand mentioning their date of entry that will be used to calculate the quarantine period. Their swab samples will be tested and none of them would be allowed to go back to their respective homes during the quarantine period. Also, none of their family members will be allowed to meet them. Each person would get Rs 2,000 at the end of the quarantine period,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/special-train-from-kerala-to-odisha-transport-stranded-migrant-workers/story-6Wio7OjeqeVhApkcwV3NvJ.html

The classification of districts as red zones will take into account the total number of active cases, doubling rate of confirmed cases, extent of testing and surveillance feedback from the districts. Those districts, which are neither defined as red nor green, shall be classified as orange zones. “The classification of districts into Red, Green and Orange Zones will be shared by MoHFW with the states and Union Territories (UTs) on a weekly basis, or earlier, as required. While States and UTs can include additional districts as Red and Orange Zones, they may not lower the classification of a district included by MoHFW in the list of Red or Orange Zones,” MHA said.The latest guidelines, according to the press statement, state that a limited number of activities will remain prohibited throughout the country, irrespective of the zone including travel by air, rail, metro and inter-State movement by road; running of schools, colleges, and other educational and training/ coaching institutions; hospitality services, including hotels and restaurants; places of large public gatherings, such as cinema halls, malls, gymnasiums, sports complexes etc; social, political, cultural and other kinds of gatherings; and, religious places/ places of worship for public. However, movement of persons by air, rail and road is allowed for select purposes, and for purposes as permitted by the government. Officials familiar with the development said movement of persons through air and rail pertains to specific Covid-19 preparation relation activity.The order by MHA also states that inter-district movement of individuals and vehicles in Orange zones will be allowed for permitted activities only. Bringing slight relaxation in vehicular movement, the order allows four-wheeler to have a maximum of 2 passengers besides the driver. Additionally, pillion riding will be allowed on two-wheelers. According to latest guidelines, which MHA said also prescribe certain measures for well being and safety of persons, movement of individuals, for all non-essential activities, shall remain strictly prohibited between 7 pm to 7 am. “Local authorities shall issue orders under appropriate provisions of law, such as prohibitory orders [curfew] under Section 144 of CrPC, for this purpose, and ensure strict compliance. “In all zones, persons above 65 years of age, persons with co-morbidities, pregnant women, and children below the age of 10 years, shall stay at home, except for meeting essential requirements and for health purposes. Out-Patient Departments (OPDs) and Medical clinics shall be permitted to operate in Red, Orange and Green Zones, with social distancing norms and other safety precautions; however, these will not be permitted within the containment zones,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-lockdown-3-0-india-s-national-lockdown-extended-again-all-you-need-to-know/story-4Ml5zMngYijQCSwVQ0ExoM.html
01-05-2020||India||Central Vista project: Environment ministry clears way for new Parliament building||The Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC)’s expert appraisal committee (EAC) has recommended granting of green clearance to the “expansion and renovation” of the existing Parliament building.The new Parliament building is a part of the government’s grandiose Central Vista project, which involves building a new complex on a plot adjacent to the existing structure at an estimated cost of Rs 922 crore.The total area involved in building and renovation is 21.25 acres, built-up area of 1,09,940 square metres and will require transplanting of 233 trees. The contentious project has been widely criticised by urban planners and civil society groups for spending hundreds of crores on renovating the heritage structure during an unprecedented economic slowdown triggered by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.They had also raised other concerns as well. They have questioned the reason behind breaking Central Vista, a single development project, into parts, as doubts have been raised whether this has been done to obtain environmental clearance.The Central Public Works Department (CPWD) had listed the Parliament building as an “individual project” in the EIA documents. It had also stated that there are no “interlinked projects”, which LokPATH (people for Appropriate Transformation of Habitat), a collective of urban development experts that are reviewing decisions related to the Central Vista project, has dubbed factually incorrect.The EAC minutes of its meetings, held between April 22 and 24 and published on the ministry’s Parivesh website, stated that the Parliament building has been cleared with certain conditions.One of the conditions is the outcome of a special leave petition (SLP) pending before the Supreme Court (SC).The apex court is hearing two petitions filed by citizens against the way the public hearing was conducted to facilitate the project and challenging the legal validity of the land-use change process.In March, the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) had changed the land-use of the 9.5-acre plot from “recreational” to “Parliament”.The EAC minutes address concerns raised by LokPATH and other civil society groups by answering each of the concerns highlighted by them.For example, civil society groups had said that the Indian Parliament is structurally a part of the composite notified heritage precinct, the Central Vista.“The application completely disregards the historical, cultural and social importance of the existing Parliament by treating its ‘expansion and renovation’ as any other regular construction project,” they had argued.In response, the EAC stated: “The project proponents are aware of the heritage value of the Parliament Building. It is because of the need to protect its heritage value, besides other practical aspects such as seating more members for the future and providing them with necessary infrastructure, that the project has been conceived.”The other concern raised by citizens is that the Parliament building application is being projected as a stand-alone project when it is a part of the larger Central Vista project, which also ignores the cumulative impacts of the project.The EAC has argued that integrated and inter-related projects, as referred to in the ministry’s official memorandum, are that without which the functional outcome of the proposed project cannot be achieved and that is not the case for the units of the Central Vista project.Experts said it was a “fait accompli” situation, where the land-use was changed by the DDA and clearance has been recommended even before the outcome of the SC case.“All the concerns of building-by-building approach to impact assessment of the Central Vista project remain. The cumulative impacts of the entire Central Vista redevelopment over a much larger area are different from that of one new Parliament building. What gets even more questionable today is that the new Parliament building, which is estimated to cost Rs 922 crore, is approved when the country is facing a severe economic, humanitarian and environmental crisis because of Covid-19,” said Kanchi Kohli, a legal researcher at the Centre for Policy Research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/central-vista-project-environment-ministry-clears-way-for-new-parliament-building/story-yY52Zgr4yq4i4z1xDAljSI.html

This project will bring in more transparency in the DGCA’s official work and help all stakeholders by reducing the processing time for various licences/permissions.It was also decided that all reform initiatives taken by the Ministry of Civil Aviation and the organizations falling under it should proceed in a time-bound mannerHome Minister Amit Shah, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Minister of State (Civil Aviation), Minister of State (Finance) and other senior officials of the Union government attended the meeting with the Prime Minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-chairs-meet-on-civil-aviation-plans-to-use-indian-air-space-efficiently-post-lockdown/story-kZwcCm1pQNvtEgecynCijI.html
01-05-2020||India||After nod for Maharashtra, EC to focus on Rajya Sabha polls, Bihar||After clearing elections to fill nine vacant seats in the Maharashtra Legislative Council, the Election Commission will decide next week whether polls can be held to fill 17 seats in the Bihar Legislative Council and 18 in the Rajya Sabha.In Bihar, the sheer number of voters likely to participate in the elections will be a major consideration while deciding the schedule, said an official aware of the details.Apart from the nine vacancies from the Vidhan Sabha constituency, elections will be held to fill eight vacancies in the teachers’ constituency and graduate constituency in Bihar, for which more than 400,000 voters have registered so far.In April, following the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Election Commission indefinitely deferred polls through its powers under Article 324 of the Constitution, read with section 153 of the Representation of the People Act, to extend the period of elections beyond the prescribed term.As a result, elections to fill 18 Rajya Sabha vacancies – four each in Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh, three each in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, two in Jharkhand, and one each in Manipur and Meghalaya – were put off.The governments of Gujarat and Rajasthan had also written to the Election Commission to withhold the date for elections.Asked whether the commission has begun discussions with these state governments to get a view of the ground situation, an Election Commission official said talks are underway and the situation in each state will be assessed before a decision.“Each state will be assessed separately, since the condition in each state is different. In the case of Maharashtra, the state government categorically states it will ensure elections will be held as per the stated health protocols,” the official said.On Friday, the Election Commission announced May 21 as the date for holding polls in Maharashtra, where chief minister Uddhav Thackeray is among contestants.According to the health ministry’s data, Gujarat has recorded 4,395 cases of infection and 214 deaths, Madhya Pradesh 2,660 cases and 147 deaths, Rajasthan 2,584 cases and 58 deaths, Jharkhand 109 cases and three deaths, and Andhra Pradesh 1,403 cases and 31 deaths.Commenting on the pending Rajya Sabha elections, Javed Ali Khan of the Samajwadi Party and a member of the Upper House, said the decision on holding polls is the prerogative of the Election Commission.“The situation in Maharashtra was unique. There was a constitutional requirement for the chief minister to get elected. But there is no such compulsion to fill the Rajya Sabha seats, so the Election Commission’s decision on Maharashtra cannot be questioned,” he said. A state government official in Bihar said the Election Commission will be informed about challenges related to ensuring distancing and sanitation protocols. Bihar has recorded 418 cases and three deaths.“The number of people who will register for the teachers’ and the graduate constituencies is over four lakh now. It will keep going up till the last date of filing nominations. We are looking at very large voter participation. Polling stations for these eight seats will be set up at every block across districts and it will not be easy to ensure proper distancing and health protocols,” the official in Bihar said.RJD leader and Rajya Sabha member Manoj Jha, however, said since holding elections for the legislative council is different from assembly elections, the poll panel should consider announcing dates for Bihar as well. “There has to be a universal policy for all,” Jha said.In Uttar Pradesh, 11 legislative council seats – six in the teachers’ constituency and five in the graduates’ constituency – are vacant but a state government official said there had been no discussion so far on how soon elections to fill these seats will be held. Article 324 empowers the poll panel to direct, control and conduct elections to Parliament, the legislature of every state and elections to the offices of president and vice president, and extension of time for completion of polls. Section 153 allows the Election Commission, for reasons it considers sufficient, to extend the time to complete any election by making necessary amendments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-nod-for-polls-in-maharashtra-ec-to-focus-on-rajya-sabha-bihar/story-Wh4bupYJl7g9q9W3XUHIAM.html

Her husband, who is an employee of the institute and her two children, have been quarantined in a separate facility on the campus. “The lady is a health worker in a hospital and her husband works at our institute. They lived on the campus. So, once she tested positive, she was moved to a hospital and her family was quarantined in a special area on the campus. She is doing fine and is undergoing treatment,” said institute director Subhasis Chadhuri. Officials of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) visited the campus on Friday and standard operating procedures were being followed. The institute has sanitised some of the common areas that the woman might have accessed. “On our part, we have sanitised some of the common areas such as the lift and the lobby of the building the patient was residing in. Neighbours, too, have been asked to follow BMC directives for quarantine. We will cooperate with the state authorities on the matter,” said Chaudhuri.Chaudhuri has also urged residents not to panic. “Although there is nothing to panic as yet, we hope there are no more positive cases in the campus,” he said.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesAll academic and research activities remain suspended on campus since mid-March and early summer vacation was announced with the students being told to vacate the campus.

According to the state police, SPOs are emerging as “additional hands and eyes” in the state’s fight against the Covid-19 epidemic. The SPOs were appointed by the state police about two weeks ago especially to implement the lockdown norms in the containment zones of the state. They were selected from the people living in those areas where they are now deployed.At present, there are more than 3,000 SPOs across the state. The major districts where they have been deployed include US Nagar, Haridwar, Nainital and Dehradun which all have witnessed increasing cases of Covid-19 and where containment zones have been declared. Among the aforementioned four districts, US Nagar has deployed about 1,300 SPOs which are mainly at the border areas with neighbouring Uttar Pradesh to keep a check on people trying to sneak in. “We have a 171 km long border with UP in which we identified about 125 points through which people can enter or go out. We have deployed the majority of the SPOs in those areas because with the given conditions it is not possible for the district police to man those points 24 hours,” said Barinderjit Singh, senior superintendent of police(SSP), US Nagar. Singh said, “As the SPOs are from those areas only, they are well aware of the topography and know who has come from outside. They accordingly inform us for further action. Apart from the border areas, they are also being deployed in the containment zones to implement the norms of lockdown.”Senthil Avoodai K Raj, SSP Haridwar while lauding the contribution of SPOs, termed them as additional hands and eyes of the regular police. Senthil said, “As they are among the residents of the same society, they act as a bridge between police and the public of the area where they are deployed. In Haridwar district, they are mainly deployed in containment zones to ensure home quarantine and social distancing.”He said, “They also inform the police about any issues faced by the people of an area for required action.”Ashok Kumar, director general (law & order) Uttarakhand police said, the SPOs are very helpful to the regular police in enforcing the lockdown. “They are appointed as per a provision in the Police Act. However, they are not paid any remuneration. It is a completely voluntary service for about 3 to 4 hours a day. They are a big help to the state police in enforcing the lockdown properly,” said Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-uttarakhand-s-3-000-special-police-officers-are-emerging-as-hands-and-eyes-in-covid-fight/story-4wTh27dI7l58OQGerUZ0tL.html

Several of these students have run out of money and are said to be desperate to return home.“Movement of migrant workers, pilgrims, tourists, students and other persons, stranded at different places is also allowed by special trains to be operated by the ministry of railways,” the Friday order by the government said.Out of the Shramik Special train services announced by the ministry also include a special between Kota and Ranchi which will run on May 1, the Labour Day. This train is likely to ferry students from Jharkhand stuck in Kota.Close to ten thousand students from Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh and Haryana are said to be stranded in the city known for its educational institutes that train students for engineering, medical, civil services and other competitive examinations.Around 9,000 students enrolled in different coaching centres at Kota have already been transported in around 250 buses to different places in Uttar Pradesh in mid-April and another 3,000 were recently sent back on buses to West Bengal, some students were also sent back to Chhattisgarh,Earlier in the day, the railways ministry had allowed a special train from Hyderabad with about 1200 migrant workers onboard to leave for Ranchi in Jharkhand. The ministry said that it could allow more such trains if the states sending and receiving migrant labourers expressed their willingness.Several states including Punjab, Rajasthan, West Bengal, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu have requested central government for allowing limited interstate services to carry stranded people including migrants and students.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesThe railways has made it clear that all safety protocols including social distancing and necessary sanitization will have to be observed at both the originating station and the destination while the special services are in operation.Close to 10 million migrant workers are said to be stranded in different states in relief camps, as per a rough estimate. Several states including Maharashtra have reported restlessness in the group and expressed fear that not allowing them to return to their home states could lead to a law and order situation which could be counter-productive to coronavirus containment efforts.The migrant workers have been stranded since the announcement of the first phase of national lockdown, which started on March 25. Hundreds of thousands of migrant labourers lost their jobs and were dependent on government aid for food, shelter and sanitation. Several temporary relief camps were set up in different states to accommodate them but a big number of migrants, especially from the north in Delhi and Haryana decided to walk back to their homes in the absence of public transport.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19Several migrants were then sent home in buses arranged by Haryana and Uttar Pradesh governments but not before it resulted in chaos and mayhem on the streets of the capital and neighbouring Uttar Pradesh where thousands of them gathered looking for transport.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shramik-special-train-service-brings-cheer-to-thousands-of-students-stranded-in-kota/story-qe8jOJqEMYzJibnBUvEoMK.html

He expressed happiness over the treatment provided by the railways in the train. “We are being provided food in time and facing no problem,” Singh, who is also the resident of Daltonganj, said.They are not alone but over 1,000 workers, most of them belonging to Jharkhand’s Daltonganj and Garhwa district, travelling in the train are also happy returning home after 38 days of lockdown. The special train is expected to arrive at Ranchi’s Hatia station by 11pm on Friday.“We are expecting the train to arrive at Hatia station by 11pm,” Chief public relation officer-cum-senior divisional operation manager of Ranchi division, Neeraj Kumar said.The Jharkhand government is all prepared to receive the first lot of migrant workers coming in a special train from Telangana and the workers arriving from West Bengal’s Burdwan district in three buses in Jharkhand’s Sahibganj district.The workers who are travelling by train would be sent to the respective districts, mostly by tonight. The joint secretary of state disaster management department, Manish Tiwary, said, “The workers arriving by trains would be sent to their respective districts where they will be screened and quarantined.”State transport department is arranging 50 private buses to ferry the workers to their respective districts.A senior official from the transport department, who did not wish to be named, said, “Most of the workers coming by train belonged to Daltonganj and Garhwa district. We need at least 50 buses to ferry them to their destinations from Hatia station. They will be sent to their respective districts tonight.”He further said three buses were also sent to West Bengal’s Burdwan district to bring the workers stranded there. “One police and a magistrate have also been sent in each bus, who would ensure implementation of social distancing and screening there. Average 25 workers would come in one bus,” the official said.Chief minister Hemant Soren has been demanding from the Centre to allow special trains to bring Jharkhand’s migrant workers, as it is a big challenge for the state to bring workers from distant states such Mumbai, Gujarat, Telangana, Bengaluru and others. “We have readied the work plan for the workers and students stranded outside. I would like to appeal to them to not worry. The state government will bring you back safely to the home,” said Hemant Soren in special appeal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jharkhand-preps-as-migrant-workers-return-home-in-special-train-from-telangana/story-4xdpBhE6Lultx4uJrVuYRP.html

Expats from Kerala would be the first ones to be brought since the state has created the infrastructure to accommodate about 2 lakh people at quarantine centres and hospitals.Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla on Friday reviewed the work done so far to carry out the repatriation plan at the foreign ministry’s Jawaharlal Nehru Bhawan office in central Delhi.Once executed, officials said, this would be a record-setting exercise.India’s evacuation of 1,70,000 civilians from Kuwait during the 1990 Gulf war is still considered to be the world’s largest evacuation exercise of civilians by air. India had then operated a little less than 500 flights, mostly by Air India, over two months. More than 25 years later, the feat also inspired the Akshay Kumar-starrer Bollywood flick ‘Airlift’.A top government official told Hindustan Times that this time, over 1,90,000 people would be brought home in the first phase alone.Blue collar workers would get the first priority to be flown home in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s directive. Among them, those who are facing health problems of any nature, have had a bereavement in the family or cite any other humanitarian ground would be taken in the early round of flights.The government hasn’t decided yet when the first repatriation flight will take off from India.“It will happen soon”, an official said, stressing that India or the world hadn’t seen anything of this kind in the past.Apart from planes of commercial airlines including Air India, the official said the armed forces had also pooled in their resources.The Indian Air Force would be deploying its largest transport planes including C-17 Globemaster III, which was also used to evacuate Indians from Yemen in 2015 , as well as the C-130J Hercules. The Indian Navy, on the other hand, is ready to send its largest ships including INS Jalashwa.Officials said passengers and crew of the planes and warships would have to maintain social distancing norms. “This means that we will to make twice as many trips,” one official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-to-start-repatriation-of-stranded-indians-from-the-gulf-uae-is-first/story-8S9O2xqt6fshJBw7qVdwdN.html

He is now in home quarantine. Atiul Shah started his journey on April 17 from Salem in Tamil Nadu where he had gone to install air-conditioners in newly constructed buildings. But as the pan-India lockdown started, his employer refused to give him any money and he left the job after an altercation. As his hardships started, he made up his mind to take the long arduous journey back home.“I exchanged my mobile phone with a security guard at the construction site where I worked. I took his bicycle and a few hundred rupees. Every day I peddled throughout the day and sometimes at night too. I took rest only when I could not take the pain anymore,” said Atiul Shah. Sometimes he took shelter in railway stations, sometimes outside police stations and sometimes under the shade of bridges, flyovers and abandoned shops along national highways.“One day I spent the night on a sea-beach. As the waves were coming nearer at night, I tied the bicycle to a palm tree and spent the night on that tree. It was desolate. But I had only one thing in mind. I will reach home anyhow,” he added.On his way, he met people, including police personnel, some of whom helped him with food and medicines.“Sometimes I was stopped by police personnel who refused to allow me to go any further. I narrated my story and begged before them. Later they helped me. One policeman even gave me a mask. Once a policeman gave me medicines, when he saw my legs were swollen,” said ShahAtiul could hardly remember the names of places he passed. He only remembers the hills, the sea, wide rivers and highways. Sometimes when he found shops open, he bought biscuits and dry food. Sometimes he would stand in long queues when he saw NGOs providing food to labourers.“At one point of time I could hardly pedal anymore. I then took lift from a passing motorcycle. But as I could not carry the bicycle, I had to abandon it. The motorcycle rider dropped me at one point from where I got a lift from a passing truck. Again the truck driver dropped me at one point from where I started walking. Later I met a local villager who had a bicycle. I purchased it from him for Rs 1,000 and this is how I reached home,” he added.The news of his homecoming spread like wildfire in the village and several villagers came to have a look. The local leaders took him to the Diamond Harbour Hospital where he was checked and asked to remain in home quarantine.“I met him from a distance as he is in home quarantine. He has cycled over 2,000 km in 13 days, he told me. His brother had approached me earlier for help to bring him back home. I asked them to get in touch with the local BDO of Salem but they couldn’t. Later he came back on his own,” said Mozaffar Sheikh, the deputy village pradhan of Singla village.His family, including his wife, was elated to know about his return. His wife, however, is in her parents’ house and could not meet him. The couple has spoken over phone.“I am lucky that my brother made it. As he had exchanged his mobile phone for a cycle, he used to call us from other persons’ numbers whom he met on the way. We could not get in touch with him all this time,” said Ismail Shah, his elder brother.Also read | India under lockdown: Migrant labourer pedals 1,700 km in 7 days to reach home||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/migrant-labourer-cycles-walks-hitchhikes-around-2-000-km-in-13-days-to-reach-home/story-0CLY6VT1JH71RLpJcDxEwI.html

Baghel in his letter to PM Modi stated that the instructions issued on April 29 by the Union Ministry of Home Affairs for inter-state movement of workers, migrants will prove beneficial in restoring normalcy and economic activities in the state.Drawing the prime minister’s attention towards workers, migrants of the state who are stranded in other states and are unable to return due to lockdown, Baghel said that the number of such workers is more than 1.6 lakh at present and taking care of the economic and mental condition of these workers and their homecoming is very important.The CM said the Central Government’s decision of imposing lockdown for prevention of Covid-19 helped in controlling the spread of this epidemic in the state, as a result of which the number of coronavirus positive patients in the state is less.The CM stated in the letter that Chhattisgarh is coordinating with other states for return of these migrants and an action plan has been chalked out to bring back these workers through buses. However, it would be difficult to arrange buses and other infrastructure required to bring back these workers in such large numbers. Also, it will be extremely difficult to take care of the safety and convenience of these migrants on a long distance journey.“In the present situation point to point special trains could be run to ensure safety, convenience and hygiene of these workers. The Chhattisgarh government has requested Union Home Minister Amit Shah in this regard. I request you to take a quick decision regarding operating a special train for bringing back stranded labourers of Chhattisgarh from other states,” the CM said in his letter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-cm-bhupesh-baghel-writes-to-pm-modi-wants-special-train-to-ferry-1-6-lakh-migrants/story-amTvlUliA9YzgVg8zEBgyJ.html

The bail order by Delhi court allows Talwar to walk out of Tihar jail by evening. He had earlier been granted bail in other matters.The Special CBI Judge - AK Kuhar at Rouse Avenue Courts, granted the bail to Talwar on Friday through video conferencing after hearing arguments from both ED and his lawyer.Talwar’s counsel – Tanveer Ahmed Mir told HT – “For past more than one year since he was brought to India and arrested, Deepak Talwar was incarcerated in several cases. The allegations against him are imaginary. We have been fighting throughout and got him anticipatory bail in two each cases of CBI and ED and regular bail in those cases. He will finally be able to go to his home”.Mir argued before the court that Talwar was in jail for almost 15 months while agencies have not been able to present any evidence against him.ED’s counsels Amit Mahajan and Nitesh Rana argued that Talwar should not be granted bail as he is involved in serious economic offence.Officials familiar with the development said the ED will now have to approach the high court to get his bail cancelled.Talwar was brought from Dubai in January 31 last year. He is being investigated in different aviation deals and FCRA (foreign contribution regulation act) violations by his NGO. Both ED and CBI had taken his custody last year.CBI filed a chargesheet against him in March this year alleging that his NGO received Rs 90.72 crore under the corporate social responsibility (CSR) scheme for carrying out social activities but it was diverted for some other purposes. ED’s money laundering probe is based on CBI FIR.In aviation deals, Talwar is accused of receiving payments to the tune of Rs 272 crore during 2008-09 from private international airlines in lieu of securing favourable traffic rights using his contacts, due to which Air India had allegedly suffered huge losses. Both CBI and ED have claimed that he arranged kickbacks for the public servants to make Air India give up profit making routes in favour of private airlines. Deepak Talwar’s son Aditya Talwar is also under investigation in the aviation cases. He is currently based in Antigua and Barbuda. Deepak Talwar’s name had also appeared in the Nira Radia tapes and later 54 times in the controversial visitors’ entry register of former CBI director Ranjit Sinha’s residence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/deepak-talwar-gets-bail-likely-to-be-released-from-n-tihar-jail-by-evening/story-8K9u9DfwNOb5XjxjXKJj0M.html

Lala Lajpat Rai (LLR) hospital’s Chief Medical Superintendent, Dr RK Maurya, confirmed the victim was Covid-19 positive and shifted to the facility on Thursday night.

The railways will soon come up with guidelines on the sale of tickets, and on the social-distancing norms to be followed at stations and inside the trains, the order added.“As per the guideline issued by the ministry of home affairs, it has been decided to run “Shramik Special” trains from “Labour Day” today, to move migrant workers, pilgrims, tourists, students and other persons stranded at different places due to lockdown,” said the railways.The move comes after states requested the Centre to run special trains for migrant workers. Earlier, while relaxing the guidelines, the Centre only allowed the movement by buses. These special trains will be run from point to point on the request of both the concerned State governments for sending and receiving such stranded persons. The railways and state governments will appoint senior officials as nodal officers for coordination and smooth operation of these “Shramik Specials”.The passengers will be screened by the sending states and only those found asymptomatic would be allowed to travel. It will be mandatory for every passenger to wear masks. Meals and drinking water would be provided to the passengers by the sending states at the originating station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/special-trains-to-ferry-students-migrant-workers-stranded-amid-lockdown-govt/story-mQx1Tr52Sf8NhH9nmVBGfN.html

However, restrictions will not be lifted in Mumbai, its surrounding areas, in Pune and its surrounding areas as they fall under the red zone. Comparing the red zone areas to an active volcano, Thackeray said that lifting restrictions is “not in our interest”.Thackeray addressed the state on Maharashtra Day via Facebook Live and said, “The red zone is like an active volcano, orange zone is like a dormant volcano, and the green zone is where the volcano will not erupt. Naturally, Mumbai, Mumbai Metropolitan Region, Pune, Pune Metropolitan Region, Nagpur and Aurangabad fall in the red zone as cases are increasing daily. Here, to start something is not in our interest. In orange zones, there are a few active cases in some areas; we are looking at lifting restrictions leaving aside areas where there are more cases. In the green zone, we have already started lifting restrictions gradually.” He outlined that lifting of restriction will be done “cautiously”.The chief minister added that farming and agriculture related activities were not under restrictions before and will continue to remain exempt in areas where restrictions may continue after May 3.Thackeray added that the lockdown had helped to keep the spread of coronavirus in control. He said that the “speed breakers” have helped contain the spread which would have grown exponentially had lockdown not been imposed. He said that though the numbers of cases are increasing in Maharashtra, they are increasing among the contacts and in a cluster. He said that 75% to 80% of the Covid-19 cases in the state do not show any symptoms or show mild symptoms of the disease. Outlining the work done by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, Thackeray said that in the past few days the civic body has screened 2 lakh people in the slums for low oxygen level and other diseases including diabetes, high blood pressure, etc. Such people are susceptibility to the coronavirus. “In Mumbai, 272 people have been found with low oxygen level and other ailments. BMC is not only providing oxygen but doctors are treating their other ailments,” he said. Thackeray said that besides ramping up capacity of beds in the state, doctors and nursing staff have been inducted. He said he has received responses from 10,000 people including from doctors, nurses etc to volunteer in the fight against coronavirus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/curbs-to-continue-in-mumbai-pune-nagpur-after-may-3-uddhav-thackeray/story-SmxnCuAuo86OUrEpt7IcoM.html

The “one-off special train” was run early on Friday morning on the request of the Telangana government, South Central Railway chief spokesperson Ch Rakesh said.“I assure all students, migrant workers and other people stranded in other states amid COVID-19 lockdown that our administration will soon contact you and help you in coming back to the state.

01-05-2020||India||CM Baghel writes to PM seeking relaxation in borrowing limit for state||Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel in a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday sought relaxation in the state’s borrowing limit to six per cent of the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) this year in view of the situation arising out of the COVID-19 pandemic.Baghel also requested that the fiscal deficit of the state be made equal to five per cent of the GSDP as an exception.These, he said, will help achieve the objective of raising more economic resources for development activities in the state and providing relief to the needy. The chief minister in the letter also drew Prime Minister Modi’s attention towards the financial difficulties being faced by Chhattisgarh due to the COVID-19-induced lockdown. Baghel said that all economic activities in the state are stopped since March 22 to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus. He said the lockdown has not only led to revenue loss for the state, but also badly affected the economically weaker section of society, including daily wagers, labourers, small shopkeepers and rural households.Since it is the harvesting season, farmers are also facing difficulty in harvesting and selling crops, the chief minister said.He said extraordinary measures are required at the time of crisis, so the state should be given approval to relax the borrowing limit to six per cent of the GSDP this year. The financial deficit of the state should also be approved to be kept equal to five per cent of the GSDP as an exception this year, Baghel said. The chief minister informed that the budget allocation for the 2020-21 fiscal has already been released to all the departments of the state and there is a need for financial resources for expenditure for basic needs.He said that the Union Finance Ministry’s consent to the state for borrowing Rs 5,375 crore from the market, which is equal to 50 per cent of the state’s net lending limit for the first nine months of this financial year, is insufficient to meet the expenditure in this period. Baghel said as the state’s revenue receipts are expected to fall this year, relaxation is necessary in the state’s net borrowing limit and the fiscal deficit limit (three per cent of the GSDP) as determined by provisions of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act.He said Chhattisgarh has been a state that has ensured strict adherence to financial discipline since its formation. Currently, it has the lowest debt burden (19.2 per cent of GSDP) and lowest interest payments (7.4 per cent of total revenue receipts).The chief minister expressed hope that in these difficult times, the Centre will consider his legitimate demands.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cm-bhagel-writes-to-pm-seeking-relaxation-in-borrowing-limit-for-state/story-CyfhQ1rX1LxwLIO0rYdgMM.html
01-05-2020||India||Anti-Muslim incidents bound to attract negative attention abroad; need to change domestic reality: Tharoor||Asserting that incidents and comments against Muslims were bound to attract negative reactions abroad, senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor on Friday said it is more important to change the domestic reality than do damage control, while referring to India’s criticism in the Arab states over alleged “Islamophobia”.What matters is not what the government says but how it is perceived because of what it does, or let others do, Tharoor said, and alleged that the Modi government has “shamefully failed” to curb the appalling behaviour of many of its “most rabid supporters”, including some in high positions.“Let us not forget that ‘Ramzade/Hara.....’ comment came from a minister, and the latest remark from a BJP MLA in UP telling people not to buy vegetables from a Muslim vendor,” Tharoor said.His remarks were an apparent reference to 2014 comments reportedly made by Union minister Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti, and the recent controversy triggered by Uttar Pradesh BJP MLA Suresh Tewari who allegedly asked people not to buy vegetables from Muslim vendors. The BJP on Tuesday issued a show cause notice to Tewari for his remarks.In an interview to PTI, Tharoor alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has, throughout the last six years, been too slow to “condemn his party’s bigotry and has condoned overt expressions of Islamophobia from his own camp”.“The attitude that India loves Muslims so long as they are outside India, but insults them at home, is not tenable in a world of instant global communications. The mounting number of incidents and statements against Muslims in India was bound to attract negative attention abroad,” the former Union minister said.His remarks came in the backdrop of angry reactions from UAE royal princess, Kuwait government and other leading citizens from various Arab countries after some people blamed Muslims for spreading COVID-19 in several parts of India following a spurt in coronavirus cases linked to Tablighi Jamaat meet at Nizamuddin here.Also, the 57-member prominent international Mulim grouping, Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), recently accused India of “Islamophobia”.  Ministry of External Affairs Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava on Thursday dismissed all such allegations and highlighted Prime Minister Modi and External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar’s regular conversations with their counterparts from the region in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, to stress the closeness in ties.Responding to the criticism in Gulf nations and by the OIC, Tharoor said the backlash is not surprising.“While I welcome the PM’s and the Foreign Minister’s attempts at damage control, it is far more important to change the domestic reality than to issue reassuring statements,” the MP from Thiruvananthapuram said.Asked about plea by several Indians stuck in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries and his request to the prime minister and the external affairs minister to expedite their evacuation, Tharoor said every nation has a responsibility towards its citizens. He claimed that the government’s argument is that a large number of travellers from abroad would place an unsustainable degree of strain on the country’s healthcare and quarantine facilities.“If that was true 40 days ago, it is no longer true now. We must bring our own citizens back. It is not just a matter of their rights, but of what’s right – morally, emotionally and constitutionally,” the Congress leader said.Tharoor also demanded that in these difficult times of the pandemic, the Centre must give the state governments their dues.  It is shocking that GST dues have not been paid despite states, and the Congress calling for this for more than two months, he said.“Give the states their own money, so they don’t have to beg for resources to combat the virus. In addition, yes, extra support will be needed for those states facing a larger COVID-19 burden,” Tharoor said.“The ordinary people of our country also need financial help so they can help themselves. We have been calling for Rs 7,500 to be put into every Jan Dhan account. This is far from happening, several weeks after we suggested it,” he said.Asked about Kerala doing well in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic and whether other states need to emulate its model, Tharoor said Kerala has been a model state in terms of its social development indicators for a long time, but the practices and systems it has built up take generations to entrench.  Kerala spends a large portion of its state resources on health care and public education, promotes literacy and women’s empowerment, and gives village-level local authorities autonomy and funds, he said.Other states should emulate it, but it will take them a long time to reorient their current practices to get there, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/anti-muslim-incidents-bound-to-attract-negative-attention-abroad-need-to-change-domestic-reality-tharoor/story-iTKdyCotad5TsCoSlTTMsI.html

The state was expecting that it would become coronavirus-free by the first week of May.There had been no deaths in Telangana since April 23, and the number of positive cases was also within single digits. On Thursday, however, the state reported 22 cases and three deaths – all in Hyderabad. With this addition, the overall number of Covid-19 cases in Telangana mounted to 1,038 while the total number of deaths touched 28.According to the Telangana medical and health department authorities, only people with serious co-morbid conditions are succumbing to the disease. The dead included a 48-year-old man with diabetes, hypertension, obesity and pneumonia in Ramanthapur; a 76-year-old man with chronic heart and kidney ailments and pneumonia in Vanasthalipuram; and a 44-year-old woman with blood pressure, sugar and pneumonia in Ziaguda.The health authorities discovered that the 22 new coronavirus positive cases had originated in Malakpet Gunj, a wholesale groceries market. Apparently, it originated from two workers hailing from Pahadi Shareef in the old city of Hyderabad and they are alleged to have transmitted the virus to three shop owners. All the family members of the shop owners also have tested positive.The health authorities have declared Malakpet Gunj and Pahadi Shareef areas containment zones and said strict lockdown measures would be implemented to contain further spread.Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao held an emergency meeting with the officials of the health department, Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation and the police to discuss the steps to contain the spread of the disease.He asked health authorities to strictly implement the lockdown restrictions at all the containment zones in Hyderabad. He instructed that focus should be laid on breaking the transmission chains across the containment zones in Hyderabad. He also directed officials from different departments to put up a coordinated effort to contain Covid-19.Meanwhile, the Centre has declared six districts in Telangana – Hyderabad, Ranga Reddy, Medchal-Malkajgiri, Suryapet, Vikarabad and Warangal (Urban) - as Red Zone districts. Similarly, in Andhra Pradesh, five districts – Kurnool, Krishna, Guntur, Nellore and Chittoor – have been declared as Red Zones.The lockdown will continue in these Red Zone districts even after May 3, when the Centre is planning to lift restrictions on certain sectors.In the neighbouring Andhra Pradesh, the number of Covid-19 positive cases continue to rise.

In a letter to the prime minister, the Chhattisgarh CM also asked that the fiscal deficit of the state be kept at 5 per cent of the Gross State Domestic Producgt (GSDP) to help it arrange for more financial resources to conduct official and development works.Baghel said that due to the effective implementation of the lockdown in the state from March 22 March, all economic activities across the country including Chhattisgarh have been stopped, which has caused revenue loss to the state.“Complete lockdown has mostly affected the financially weaker section of the society, which includes daily wagers, labourers, small shopkeepers and most rural families. It is also the time for harvesting crops. Hence, farmers are harvesting crops and selling it to make both ends meet. As this section of society constitutes major part of the Chhattisgarh’s population, it is difficult for the state to take appropriate social and financial measures to bring relief to them, without the central government’s intervention,” the chief minister’s letter stated.The CM further stated that all the state departments have been allotted budget for fiscal year 2020-21 and financial resources are required for expenditures related to basic requirements.“Government of India’s Finance Ministry has approved 50% of the net credit limit which is Rs 5,375 crores to the state for taking market loans in the first nine months of this financial year. This is insufficient for the expenses in the current situation,” the letter stated. The CM in his letter claimed that as a significant decline is expected in the state’s revenue collection this year, it requires relaxation in the net credit limit and the fiscal deficit limit (3% of GSDP) for the state under the provisions of Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act. Chhattisgarh state has been strictly following financial discipline since the day of formation, and even at present, Chhattisgarh has the least loan pressure (19.2% of GSDP) and least interest payable (7.4% of total revenue collection).“During emergency or disaster, extraordinary measures are required. Hence, the state should be given relaxation in credit limit upto 6% of the GSDP. Also, state should be allowed to keep the fiscal deficit upto 5% of the GSDP. Other than the expense control being done in the state through various measures, these relaxations by Central Government would bring great relief to the state during this difficult time of pandemic. I hope that Central Government would consider these genuine demands of the state on a compassionate note, keeping in view the difficulties being faced by Chhattisgarh and the entire country because of this pandemic,” the chief minister’s letter stated.Chhattisgarh has so far reported 76 cases of Covid-19. Out of these, there are 40 active cases while 36 patients have been cured, according to the Union health ministry’s latest figures released on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-lockdown-chhattisgarh-cm-baghel-writes-to-pm-modi-to-relax-state-s-credit-limit/story-IlFWpUlp83AGygzFPmYLHO.html

01-05-2020||India||Rajasthan has fewer red zone districts, 7th on nationwide list||Rajasthan now has fewer districts in the Covid-19 red zones classified by the Union health ministry, while Uttar Pradesh tops the list with 19 such districts, according to an official letter.Following the videoconference by the Cabinet secretary with chief secretaries of states on April 30, the list classifying districts as red, orange and green zones was sent to all states.Rajasthan has eight districts in the red zone, 19 in the orange zone and six in the green zone.The letter from Union health secretary Preeti Sudan, accessed by Hindustan Times, said district will be considered a green zone if it has recorded no confirmed Covid-19 cases so far, or if no cases have been reported for 21 days.According to the list, Uttar Pradesh has 19 districts in the red zone, followed by Maharashtra (14), Tamil Nadu (12), Delhi (11), West Bengal (10) and Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh (nine districts each).Of the 733 districts in the country, 130 are in the red zone, 284 in the orange zone and 319 in the green zone.In an earlier classification done on April 15, 170 districts were in the red zone, 207 districts the white zone and 353 were in the green zone. At that time, Rajasthan, with 12 hot spot districts, was among the top five states – the others were Tamil Nadu (22), Andhra Pradesh (16), Maharashtra (14) and Uttar Pradesh (13).On April 15, the Union health ministry had designated districts as hot spots or red zones, orange zones and green zones based on cumulative cases reported and the doubling rate.In the latest list, districts have been designated across the various zones by broad-basing the criteria. This classification is multi-factorial and takes into consideration incidence of cases, doubling rate, extent of testing and surveillance feedback, officials said.According to the latest classification for Rajasthan, the districts of Jaipur, Jodhpur, Kota, Ajmer, Bharatpur, Nagaur, Banswara and Jhalawar are in the red zone.Tonk, Jaisalmer, Dausa, Jhunjhunu, Hanumangarh, Bhilwara, Sawai Madhopur, Chittorgarh, Dungarpur, Udaipur, Dholpur, Sikar, Alwar, Bikaner, Churu, Pali, Barmer, Karauli and Rajsamand are in the orange zone, while Baran, Bundi, Ganganagar, Jalore, Sirohi and Pratapgarh in the green zone.“This is a dynamic list. The list will be revised on a weekly basis or earlier and communicated to states for further follow-up action in consonance with the directions issued by Ministry of Home Affairs under the Disaster Management Act, 2005,” the letter said.The Union health ministry has allowed states to designate additional red or orange zones based on feedback from the field and additional analysis at the local level. “However, states may not relax the zonal classification of districts,” the letter said.The ministry added that for districts having one or more municipal corporations, the areas under these bodies and other areas of districts may be treated as separate units.“If one or more of these units have reported no cases for last 21 days, they can be considered as one level lower in zonal classification, in case the district is in Red/Orange Zone. District authorities should, however, exercise due caution in such areas so that these areas remain free from COVID19 cases,” the letter said.Public health expert Dr Virendra Singh said Rajasthan has been able to flatten the curve due to lockdown and curfew in affected areas. “The state is among the top states in terms of testing. It is continually increasing its testing capacity, targeting 10,000 tests a day from 8,000 currently. It is because of these efforts that some Rajasthan districts have transitioned from the red to orange zone,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-has-fewer-red-zone-districts-7th-on-nationwide-list/story-mSle4pyxhwQGn3xquvk4rK.html

Dave referred to the recent order of the apex court in the case of senior journalist Arnab Goswami in which court had stayed the multiple FIRs against him except for one and said that similar relief can be granted to him.He said that FIRs are lodged against Imam in Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Assam, Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh and he has been booked under sedition charges. Recently, Delhi Police has booked Imam under Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), he said. The bench asked Dave to serve the copy of petition on the standing counsel of Delhi government and posted the matter for further hearing after 10 days.Imam in his plea had sought clubbing of all five FIRs lodged in different states and transferring them to Delhi for probe by a single agency.On April 24, the top court had stayed three FIRs and 11 complaints except for one lodged in different states against Republic TV editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami over his alleged defamatory statements against Congress Chief Sonia Gandhi during news shows on the recent Palghar lynching incident in Maharashtra.On January 28, Imam was arrested by Delhi Police’s crime branch from Bihar’s Jehanabad in a sedition case for allegedly making inflammatory speeches in Jamia Milia Islamia and Aligarh.The PhD student at the Jawaharlal Nehru University’s (JNU) Centre for Historical Studies has been booked on sedition and other charges after purported videos of his alleged inflammatory speeches made during protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) were circulated on social media.An FIR was registered against him by Delhi Police on January 25 under IPC sections 124 A (sedition) and 153 A (promoting or attempting to promote disharmony or feelings of enmity on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, caste or community or any other ground whatsoever) among others.“Two videos came to light, one was on December 13 at Jamia Milia Islamia and other was on January 16 at Aligarh, where it was noticed that Imam had delivered very inflammatory speeches in opposition to the Citizenship Amendment Act and the National Register of Citizens and such comments can potentially affect religious harmony and weaken the unity and integrity of the country,” police had said. A graduate in computer science from IIT-Mumbai, Imam had shifted to Delhi for pursuing research at the Centre for Historical Studies at the JNU.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-seeks-delhi-govt-s-response-on-plea-of-sharjeel-imam-for-clubbing-of-5-firs/story-C87sze6hgkbNFhIwYZeXcJ.html

01-05-2020||India||Covid-19: 130 red zones, 284 orange zones, 319 green zones in new govt list||In just two weeks, India has managed to reduce its coronavirus disease (Covid-19) hot spots, or red zones, from 170 to 130 districts, according to a revised list of issued to states by the Union health ministry on Thursday.All major metropolitan cities such as Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Ahmedabad, however, are now in red zones as these have been reporting high caseloads and clusters of cases.The zones have been divided on the basis of areas: red zones are those where the numbers of Covid-19 infections are high; orange zones have fewer cases; and the green zones are those where no cases have been reported so far or where no case has been detected in the last 21 days.The number of orange zones has gone up to 284 from the earlier 207 districts. The number of green zones has seen a drop from 353 to the current 319, implying some district where there were no cases earlier might have reported cases. Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra have the highest number of red zones at 19 and 14 respectively, followed by Tamil Nadu at 12. All of Delhi’s 11 districts are red zones.Also, Faridabad, Gautam Buddha Nagar and Meerut have been classified as red zones, while Gurugram and Ghaziabad are designated as orange zones.“The ministry has been regularly revising the situation on the basis of feedback it receives from ground. It is an evolving situation, and we are closely monitoring even till the block level. The IDSP units are active on ground, and generating data on a daily basis. The measures will have to continue till all red zones are converted to orange zones and then green ones,” said a senior health ministry official, requesting not to be identified.The ministry has clarified that they have also revised the criteria for designating zones.“The districts were earlier designated as hotspots / red-zones, orange zones and green zones primarily based on the cumulative cases reported and the doubling rate. Since recovery rates have gone up, the districts are now being designated across various zones duly broad-basing the criteria. This classification is multi-factorial and takes into consideration incidence of cases, doubling rate, extent of testing and surveillance feedback to classify the districts. A district will be considered under green zone, if there are no confirmed cases so far or there is no reported case since last 21 days in the district.”“It is important to ensure that we identify pockets of critical interventions for a focused management of Covid-19 at the field level, said health secretary Preeti Sudan in a letter to States.In all containment areas, stringent perimeter control and measures such as establishing clear entry and exit points, no movement except for medical emergencies and essential goods and services, no unchecked influx of population, active search for cases through house to house surveillance, testing of all cases, contact tracing and clinical management of all confirmed cases, is to be done.In buffer zones, extensive surveillance for cases through monitoring of cases of influenza-like illnesses and severe acute respiratory infections in hospitals and health centres will be conducted.“It is further highlighted that based on field feedback and additional analysis at state level, states may designate additional red or orange zones as appropriate. However, states may not relax the zonal classification of districts classified as red/orange as communicated by the ministry,” the letter further reads.“It is critical to ensure that necessary action for containment so as to break the chain of transmission of virus is initiated in both red and orange zone districts reporting confirmed cases.”Infectious disease experts say that lockdown has help and now is the time to consolidate the gains.“It is useful if we are to utilize the time gained in identifying infected individuals isolating them, tracing contacts and quarantining them to interrupt the chain of transmission. We should be able to identify cluster transmission as people are confined to homes. Mathematical models have shown how extended periods of lockdown can decrease the peak. But if infected individuals are not identified and contained, then as soon as the lockdown is lifted, there would be a spurt of cases,” said Dr Lalit Kant, infectious disease specialist and former head of the Indian Council of Medical Research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/130-red-zones-284-orange-zones-319-green-zones-in-new-covid-19-list/story-mL5pLCugjYMXdxA7AZzecM.html

Each centre will have a dedicated basic life support ambulance equipped with staff available on a 24x7 basis in line with the guidelines issued by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.State health minister Rajesh Tope said that these centres have been set up as a part of the preparations to deal with any emergency situation because of the Covid-19 outbreak.“We’ve 1,677 Covid-19 dedicated hospitals that have 1,76,357 isolated beds. There are also 7,248 beds in intensive care units (ICUs). We’ve around 3,000 ventilators, around 80,000 personal protective equipment (PPE) kits and 2.82 lakh N-95 masks,” he said.On Thursday, Maharashtra topped the 10,000-mark, as 583 new Covid-19 cases were reported. The overall state tally was 10,498 and 459 deaths.Mumbai, the worst-hit city in the country, reported 417 new Covid-19 cases on Thursday, as the total count stood at 7,061 and 290 deaths. The city has 1,459 active containment zones, according to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) authorities. However, the civic body has removed 331 containment zones from its list after they completed the mandatory 14-day quarantine period.The officials are still claiming that the situation is still under control, as most of the new cases have been reported from traced contacts.Maharashtra has 733 active containment zones, the officials said. Around 10,092 survey teams, comprising doctors and paramedical staff, have screened over 42.11 lakh people so far. While, 10,695 suspected patients have been kept at institutional quarantine facilities, and 1,68,266 are home quarantined, they added.On Thursday, the state government issued an order that no hospital can turn away any patient without examination in any circumstances. The order, which comes into effect from Saturday, was issued after several complaints came to the notice of the authorities that many hospitals are denying admission to patients.The hospitals have been warned of strict action for breach of government directives. The government has ordered that any patient, Covid-19 or non-Covid-19, entering hospital premises for treatment should be attended to immediately. The patient can be shifted or admitted after the check-up is conducted, the order added.The state government has also eased ongoing lockdown restrictions, which are in place till May 3 to contain the spread of Covid-19 outbreak, by relaxing some norms such as allowing interstate travel from Saturday for stranded workers, students, and pilgrims.“All those stranded, including migrants, pilgrims, and students, will be allowed to travel with prior written permission in a prescribed format,’’ said state home minister Anil Deshmukh.District collectors and the directors of the state disaster management unit have been empowered to grant permission for interstate travel for the stranded people, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fearing-for-the-worst-maha-govt-identifies-covid-dedicated-hospitals-with-isolation-beds/story-U1rEhYsSFmiFZ3GdxEUlfI.html
01-05-2020||India||Central Vista panel gives nod for project as external members raise concerns||The Central Vista Committee, a special advisory group for the controversial project, has given its nod for the new Parliament building even as a request from the panel’s external members for postponement of a meeting wasn’t considered on grounds of national interest.The fifth meeting, chaired by the CVC on April 23 via video conference, was attended by government officials, including five members from the Central Public Works Department (CPWD), two from HCP design, the firm chosen for designing the project, and one member each from the housing and urban affairs ministry, the environment ministry, the town and country planning organisation, and the Delhi Development Authority.The minutes of the meeting issued on Thursday said a request from the external members to put off the meeting because of the Covid-19 lockdown was overruled in view of the project’s importance for the national interest.“It is placed for record herewith that some members, through email, expressed their inability to join the meeting on the grounds of travel restrictions in view of Covid-19 and owing to lack of technical capacity at their end to join online web-based conference facility,” the minutes said.“Also submitted that being senior citizens and also on medical grounds they are house bound due to lockdown in place in Delhi. In view of the above they requested postponement of the meeting. However, keeping in view the importance of the project in nation’s interest and time scale for its implementation, the meeting was held as per issued meeting notice.”The minutes further stated there was “no objection” from the Chief Vigilance Commissioner (CVC), with suggestions that features of the proposed Parliament building be in sync with the existing Parliament.Balbir Verma, a member of the Indian Institute of Architects (IIA), said: “They went ahead without any external member in attendance. It includes two members from the Institute of Town Planners (ITP) and two from the Indian Institute of Architects (IIA). Only government officials were there.“This is clearly a conflict of interest. Even the Supreme Court on Thursday said ‘there is no hurry to hear the matter on Central Vista’. Then what was the urgency in holding this meeting despite our requests to postpone it? We had several concerns, we had informed adequate arrangements should be made for us to attend but we got a notice on April 21 that the meeting will be held.”Verma added, “A project of this magnitude must be heard by all parties of the committee. The party involved in its implementation and sanctioning it cannot be the only one to clear it, which is why external members are formed, otherwise it is a conflict of interest. The advisory group was formed in 1962 to advise on projects of this magnitude. People must be present to provide their suggestions or objections.”The environment nod for the project is still awaited. The Centre has sent a revised application for environment clearance for the new Parliament building to the environment ministry, after the issue was deferred last month by the expert appraisal committee (EAC) on infrastructure, Hindustan Times had reported on April 13.The EAC held a meeting on April 22.In an application, the Union housing and urban affairs ministry’s construction arm, the CPWD, said the project cost for the new Parliament building has increased from Rs 776 crore to Rs 922 crore “due to changes in specifications which have been approved after the application submission”.Hindustan Times had also reported on March 9 that the Centre’s original application for environmental clearance for the new Parliament complex had been deferred by the Union environment ministry.The EAC on infrastructure had met on February 25 to review the CPWD’s proposal seeking green clearance for the building. The EAC cited pending court cases related to the project as one of the reasons for deferring the application.The EAC also noted the project would provide a “larger Parliament building for the nation for better functioning of the legislature” but added the CPWD needs to meet a slew of conditions before the proposal could be reconsidered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/central-vista-panel-gives-nod-for-project-as-external-members-raise-concerns/story-UyTKrarAymPVVAva1gAuwM.html
01-05-2020||India||Indian-American Aruna Subramanian leading trial of remdesivir in Covid-19 treatment||The third phase of clinical trial of the antiviral drug remdesivir for the treatment of the coronavirus patients has shown positive results, American pharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences has said. The trial is led by a group of researchers, including Indian-American physician Aruna Subramanian.It was found that coronavirus patients receiving a 10-day treatment course of remdesivir achieved similar improvement in clinical status when compared to those taking a 5-day treatment course.“These data are encouraging as they indicate that patients who received a shorter, 5-day course of remdesivir experienced similar clinical improvement as patients who received a 10-day treatment course,” news agency PTI quoted Subramanian as saying, She is the MD, Clinical Professor of Medicine, Chief, Immunocompromised Host Infectious Diseases, Stanford University School of Medicine, and one of the lead investigators of the study.“While additional data are still needed, these results help to bring a clearer understanding of how treatment with remdesivir may be optimised, if proven safe and effective,” Subramanian said.The California-based pharma company on Wednesday said that the preliminary results showed that 50 per cent of the Covid-19 patients treated with a five-day dosage of remdesivir improved and more than half were discharged from the hospital within two weeks.The effectiveness of the drug was measured in terms of clinical improvement reported in patients ranging from improvement in breathing, increased level of oxygen support to hospital discharge.A phase three clinical trial is said to be the final step in the process of the drug approval.In an earlier interview to Stanford Medicine, Subramanian said that during normal times, a phase three clinical trial typically takes months of planning, after years of research before it is underway.“But these aren’t normal times. With a fast-moving pandemic bearing down and no approved treatments available, researchers are, like everyone else, desperate for answers, and they have ramped up their efforts to find solutions. Remdesivir jumped to the top of the list of potential treatments in part because it was farthest along in the approval process,” Subramanian said.A coronavirus infection occurs when the germ enters the body’s airways through the nose, mouth or eyes, then lodges in the cells in the lining of the lung’s airways, where it quickly starts to make millions of copies of itself, wreaking havoc on the lungs.Remdesivir, like other anti-virals, is designed to target the system the virus uses to replicate, acting as a cap that prevents the virus from making new copies of itself or infecting other cells, she said.Remdesivir is not yet licensed or approved anywhere globally and has not been demonstrated to be safe or effective for the treatment of the Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-american-aruna-subramanian-leading-trial-of-remdesivir-in-covid-19-treatment/story-wXaZFenRSr0E85PkDk4xVO.html

There are no directions from the ministry for running additional trains, at least for now,” he said.Railway Protection Force director general Arun Kumar told Hindustan Times: “The train is ferrying nearly 1,200 migrants...The train left from Lingampalli in Telangana to Hatia in Jharkhand at 4:50 am today.” He added that a decision on more such trains could be taken later on Friday.  Also Watch | Sick mother, 1-yr-old baby, children at home: Why migrants are desperateThe Centre has been under pressure from states for deploying special trains to ferry migrants and students stranded across the nation due to the lockdown imposed to stop the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).

Officials also said necessary precautions, such as screening of passengers, and maintaining social distancing at station and in the train were followed.The 1,200 migrant workers, all residents of Jharkhand, were stranded at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)-Hyderabad campus at Kandi in Sangareddy district due to the lockdown.Rakesh said no public announcement was made on the running of the special train, since it could have triggered a chaos with thousands assembling at railway stations in anticipation of more such trains.“The railway authorities were in touch with the nodal officers of the Telangana government who made arrangements for shifting of the migrant labourers to Lingampalli,” he said.An official in the Telangana government, who did not want to be named, said the 1,200 migrant labourers were taken from the IIT campus on the outskirts of Hyderabad to the railway station in 57 buses early in the morning. Officials made arrangements for their food and drinking water.On Wednesday, hundreds of migrant workers --- mostly from Jharkhand and Bihar --- frustrated with prolonged lockdown and non-payment of wages by contractors despite repeated requests, went on the rampage and attacked the police with sticks and stones at the IIT campus.The situation was brought under control with the intervention of Sangareddy district authorities who assured to send them back to their native places at the earliest.According to state estimates, about 10 million migrant labourers are stranded across the country. The movement of these workers alone is estimated to require 500,000 buses if the Centre’s social distancing norms are strictly enforced and they are transported around the same time.Opposition-ruled states such as Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Jharkhand and Kerala have asked the Centre to deploy special trains. So has Bihar, where the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Janata Dal (United) are in the ruling coalition.Passenger trains have been suspended since March 22; the Centre has allowed freight and special parcel trains for the supply of essentials. The Centre also allowed special trains for Indian Army personnel, citing national security consideration.

01-05-2020||India||Andhra farmers rise above personal financial constraints, help needy migrants||Several small and marginal farmers of Andhra Pradesh’s (AP) Anantpur district have risen above their personal financial constraints and joined hands to help the poor and needy stranded migrant workers. Anantpur, which is one of the worst-affected districts in AP and has 10 coronavirus disease (Covid-19) red zones, has reported 61 positive cases and four deaths to date.The poor farmers from this perennially-drought-stricken district, however, are pulling out all stops to help the stranded migrant workers, who are staying in relief camps and shelter homes. The farmers, largely from the district’s Kalyanadurgam area that is located adjacent to neighbouring Karnataka, are pooling in their meagre resources and supplying groceries, vegetables and fruits for the migrants.K Chandra (40), is a small farmer, who owns a 2.5-acre of an arable tract in Kanukuru village that’s barely enough for subsistence living. However, he’s moved by the pitiable plight of the stranded workers and has decided to contribute in a bid to alleviate their misery.“I grow groundnut and onion on my tiny tract of land and sell them to open market. I’ve decided to donate my meagre produce to feed the poor and the needy in the relief camps amid the ongoing lockdown restrictions,” Chandra said.Chandra and enthusiastic village youth are going about their task quietly since the nationwide lockdown restrictions initially came into force from March 25 for 21 days and then further extended for another 19 days till May 3 to contain the spread of the Covid-19 outbreak. They have been sourcing assorted foodstuff from Kanukuru and neighbouring villages and then bringing them to an adjacent warehouse that belongs to the Rural Development Trust (RDT), a non-governmental organisation (NGO) that has been working on inculcating the best agricultural practices in the drought-hit Rayalaseema region.The trust has taken up the responsibility of supplying food, groceries and vegetables to the relief camps and shelter homes since the lockdown was imposed. “So far, we’ve donated 4,300 quintals of rice, chillis, tamarind and leafy vegetables. I’m acutely aware of the pangs of hunger, and I don’t want others to suffer,” Chandra said.N Krishna Reddy, a farmer from Venkatampalli village and owns a five-acre arable plot, is also donating his vegetable produce to the trust daily.Anne Ferrer, executive director, RDT, finds the farmers’ response amid this grave humanitarian crisis “overwhelming”. “Anantapur is one of the worst-affected districts in AP. However, the viral outbreak scourge hasn’t deterred over 600 farmers from seven Red Zones in the district to generously contribute, as we’re feeding 7,000 poor people daily,” Ferrer said.On Thursday, several small farmers from Bathalapalli donated 5,000 kilograms (kg) of rice, 312 litres of edible oil, 30 kg of brinjal, 20 kg of tomatoes, 10 kg onions and 30 kg of green chillies to the RDT canteen in Anantapur. “A group of farmers from Gooty donated us firewood as well, which is coming handy for cooking,” Ferrer said.Most of the migrants living in the relief camps and shelter homes belong to Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, and they have been working in local cement factories and stone crushing units in Anantpur district.“Local farmers are supporting around 75% of our food distribution programme. However, the daily demand is growing. On Wednesday, we prepared food for almost 10,000 people. We’re working closely with the government and local authorities to support those in greater need,” said Visha Ferrer, director, RDT women empowerment director and also a programme coordinator for the food distribution programme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-farmers-rise-above-personal-financial-constraints-help-needy-migrants/story-em7ptiwGwI0QRfretdRN1L.html

As there is limited socialisation between communities, only giving grants to the Mizo NGOs is not enough to reach out to non-Mizos like the Chakmas,” the statement said.The Chakma group urged the Mizoram government to provide relief to stranded Chakmas through the Chakma Autonomous District Councul (CADC) or directly to Chakma NGOs.“We have distributed relief equally to everybody through local task forces within the state. For those stranded outside, people need to understand that we don’t give money to individuals directly,” the chief minister told HT over phone from Aizawl.“The government hands over money to resident commissioners at various places where we have Mizoram Houses. At places where we don’t have offices, we give money to the welfare organizations and it is for them to distribute among those who are in need,” he added.Zoramthanga said that if the Chakma groups need any assistance they should approach the resident commissioners at places where the state government has offices or else to contact the chief secretary’s office in Aizawl.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mizoram-cm-denies-exclusion-of-chakmas-in-allocation-of-covid-19-relief/story-4Zou9sTAiQPMkLqApKGHSJ.html

01-05-2020||India||Emissions set for a record fall due to Covid-19 this year. But it’s not a good sign||A new report by the International Energy Agency (IEA) has two important revelations about the impact of Covid-19 on energy demand.It said that all fuels, except renewables, will record a decline in demand in the coming decades. The agency also said that global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions this year are set for record fall, six times larger than the fall recorded after the 2008 financial crisis and twice as large as all previous reductions since World War II.The record fall in CO2 emissions is not a good sign as it is a clear indicator of a massive economic shock and the fall may be temporary followed by more investments in dirty fuel, experts who drafted “Global Energy Review 2020” released on Thursday said.“Resulting from premature deaths and economic trauma around the world, the historic decline in global emissions is absolutely nothing to cheer,” IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said in a statement. “And if the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis is anything to go by, we are likely to soon see a sharp rebound in emissions as economic conditions improve. But governments can learn from that experience by putting clean energy...” he added.Daily data for this year till mid-April shows that countries in full lockdown are experiencing an average 25 per cent decline in energy demand per week and countries in partial lockdown an average 18 per cent decline. Global energy demand has already declined by 3.8 per cent in the first quarter of 2020, with most of the impact felt in March when lockdowns were enforced in Europe, North America and others.The report projects that energy demand will fall six per cent in 2020 - seven times the decline after the 2008 financial crisis. The IEA said, “The decline is unprecedented - the equivalent of losing the entire energy demand of India, the world’s third largest energy consumer.”Depending on the duration of restrictive measures, developed countries are expected to see the biggest fall in energy demand - by nine per cent in the US and by 11 per cent in European Union.The energy landscape has already changed because global coal demand in the first quarter fell by eight per cent compared to last year. This was mainly due to China, a coal based economy, which was hardest hit in the first quarter. Oil demand fell by five per cent in the first quarter mainly because of restrictions on transport and aviation. But renewables recorded a growth in demand, driven by larger installed capacity in the first quarter.The IEA said that renewables receive priority in the grid and are not asked to adjust their output based on demand which insulates them from the impacts of lower energy demand. This resulted in renewables grabbing a higher share in the energy mix with record-high hourly shares in Belgium, Italy, Germany, Hungary and eastern parts of the United States. The IEA also stated that demand for renewables this year and in coming years will increase due to low operating costs.As a result of these trends in fall in oil and coal demand, global energy-related CO2 emissions are set to fall by almost eight per cent in 2020, a record drop. It will be six times larger than the one recorded in 2009. “The coronavirus pandemic has triggered a macroeconomic shock that is unprecedented in peacetime... these restrictions (lockdown) represent a challenging combination of a supply and a demand shock,” the report concluded.The impact on energy demand in India is yet to be seen. In the first quarter, energy demand in India increased by 0.3% in comparison to last year. As the lockdown continues, the impact on energy demand will be much larger in the second quarter.Experts said that Covid-19 comes with an important opportunity. “The current pandemic has brought the world to its knees. While countries are facing a public health crisis in the near-term, the world has an opportunity to show resilient character in how it deals with the issues of climate change in the long term,” said Karan Mangotra, associate director, The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI). He added, “We are all privy to the clear skies and ‘very good’ AQI numbers during the lockdown period. However, to sustain this we would need to ensure that our recovery is green and sustainable lest we have a negative rebound. How do we ensure that the construction, aviation and the automobile industries are equipped to make greener transitions? Can our recovery for some of the polluting sectors be conditional to being green and sustainable? These are some of the important questions that need to be thought through lest we let go of this opportunity.”“In the short term, the drop in power generation from coal and gas has transported power systems several years into the future, with the share of renewable energy setting new records. The longer-term impact depends on government policies,” said Lauri Myllyvirta, lead analyst at Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA).“Above all, this is an opportunity to close down polluting and outdated capacity, and speed up the development of renewable energy as a part of the economic recovery packages being prepared around the world. Renewable energy played an important role in job creation and economic recovery after the global financial crisis and this can be true of the recovery from the Covid-19 crisis as well. In India, it’s vital to align the power sector bailout package that is being prepared with the shift to clean energy, by closing down old, loss-making thermal power plants, upgrading grid infrastructure and accelerating renewable energy development,” he added.“Drop in carbon emissions is a side effect that doesn’t offset the damage especially because a short-term drop in CO2 is not useful as far as climate change is concerned. Only sustained changes in emissions are relevant here. In terms of a rebound, I expect almost all of these gains to be reversed. On the bright side, it’s plausible that some of the technology we have started using might normalise more environmentally friendly practices. For instance, flying for meetings could plausibly be reduced since it has been shown that video conferences can often work well,” said Anant Sudarshan, South Asia Director of the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/emissions-set-for-a-record-fall-due-to-covid-19-this-year-but-it-s-not-a-good-sign/story-IhY0KPk2jzQOcp3LjT8Z7H.html

They were brought to AIIMS Raipur where their RT-PCR tests were done. Out of these, two of were positive on Thursday afternoon and one has to be re-tested,” SS Sharma, AIIMS spokesperson said while speaking to HT.Sharma said that six patients, who tested negative, will continue to remain in quarantine in Mana Hospital in Raipur.“We have found that the three patients who tested positive in Surajpur district in the last three days are from Jharkhand. They are migrant labourers who worked in Maharashtra and had travelled to the border district of Rajnandgaon along with other labourers in early April,” Deepak Soni, Surajpur’s collector, said.Initially, they were placed in a camp on the inter-state border in Rajnandgaon but since it was overcrowded, the workers were shifted to the quarantine centre in Surajpur on April 17, the collector added.In Chhattisgarh, 36 people have been discharged from hospitals after recovery till now, health officials said.Meanwhile, AIIMS Raipur approved a laboratory for Covid-19 testing in Raigarh district on Thursday.“Now, the testing can also be done in virology laboratory in Lakhiram Memorial Medical College in Raigarh district,” AIIMS’ Sharma said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-migrant-labourers-from-jharkhand-test-positive-for-covid-19-in-chhattisgarh/story-slEetVnGdh14zwmDPwBuJN.html
01-05-2020||India||Pakistani soldier killed in India’s retaliatory fire along LoC in Jammu and Kashmir’s Poonch||A Pakistani soldier was killed in India’s retaliatory fire late on Wednesday as the neighbouring country continued with firing and shelling along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir’s Poonch district.The soldier was identified as Lance Naik Ali Baz by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the Pakistani army’s online publicity wing. ISPR claimed that two Pakistani civilians were also killed in the Indian firing.“Indian Army initiated unprovoked ceasefire violation (CFV) in Kailer & Rakhchikri Sectors along LoC. In Kailer Sector, Indian troops targeted Pakistan Army posts with automatics and heavy weapons,” ISPR said. Pakistan Army responded effectively, it added.“Reports of heavy losses to Indian troops in men and material. During exchange of intense fire, Lance Naik Ali Baz, age 34 years, resident of District Karak, embraced shahadat (died),” it said.“In Rakchikri Sector, Indian Army troops deliberately targeted civilian population. Due to indiscriminate fire in Kirni village, a girl age 16 & a woman age 52 years were martyred while a 10 years old boy & 55 years old woman got injured,” claimed ISPR.However, an Indian Army officer said India neither targets civilians nor uses them as human shields on the LoC.“We can confirm the elimination of at least one of their soldiers but we don’t target hapless civilians as they do,” he said.Defence spokesperson Lt Col Devender Anand said, “There was unprovoked firing and shelling by Pak troops in Shahpur and Kirni sectors late Wednesday prompting us to respond in equal measure.”Col Anand said Pakistan resorted to unprovoked ceasefire violation in Krishna Ghati sector of Mendhar sub-division in Poonch district on Thursday. The violation occurred at around 4.30am and the exchanges last for half an hour, he added.The neighbouring army has violated the ceasefire around 1,400 times this year. The total number of ceasefire violations by it stood at 3,168 in 2019 and 1,629 in 2018.News agency PTI reported that Pakistan on Thursday summoned the Indian charge d’affaires to lodge its protest over the alleged firing by the Indian troops across LoC that allegedly resulted in the death of a Pakistani soldier and two civilians.Zahid Hafeez Chaudhri director-general (South Asia & Saarc) ) registered “Pakistan’s strong protest over the alleged ceasefire violations by the Indian forces” in Rakhchikri Sector on April 29 with Gaurav Ahluwalia, Pakistan’s Foreign Office (FO) said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pakistani-soldier-killed-in-india-s-retaliatory-fire-along-loc-in-jammu-and-kashmir-s-poonch/story-yRDoqNx0Aiqj5Aiy6LKFUI.html
01-05-2020||India||Army issues alert warning to soldiers against malicious Pakistani app similar Aarogya Setu||The Indian Army has issued an alert to its personnel warning them against the possibility of their phones being hacked by Pakistani agencies using a malware carrying an app similar to India’s Aarogya Setu, two army officers said on Thursday on condition of anonymity.There have been reports of the malicious app being sent by Pakistani operatives to WhatsApp groups of army personnel and an advisory has been issued to all soldiers to download the contact-tracing Aarogya Setu app only from the government website, the Google Play store or Apple’s App Store, said one of the officials cited above. The existing cybersecurity policies on the usage of mobile phones have also been reiterated, said the second official.The government has been urging citizens to use the Aarogya Setu to prevent the spread of Covid-19 and earlier this week, in a meeting with chief ministers, Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke about “popularising the app and asked them to ensure downloads in greater numbers.”Apart from reaching out and informing users about their potential risk of infection, this “privacy-first by design” app also shares safe behaviours and updated medical advisories about Covid-19 containment in 11 languages.Defence minister Rajnath Singh last week asked India’s top military commanders to ensure that the country’s adversary is not allowed to exploit the Covid-19 situation at a time when the Pakistan army continues to violate the ceasefire on the Line of Control to help terrorists sneak into Jammu and Kashmir.The neighbouring army has violated the ceasefire around 1,400 times this year.

01-05-2020||India||Haryana hikes bus fare, VAT on diesel, petrol prices; Congress slams move||The Haryana government on Thursday decided to increase the bus fare by 15 paise per km and hike the VAT on diesel and petrol prices, drawing the flak of the Congress party for its move to “burden people” during a pandemic.The fare for ordinary, luxury and super luxury buses has been hiked from 85 paisa per passenger per km to Rs 1 per passenger per km to partially meet the increased cost of operation of buses, an official statement said after a meeting of the state cabinet.The cost of operation of buses has gone up from Rs 37.48 per km in June 2016 to Rs 52.23 per km in December 2019, it said. The Haryana Roadways has a fleet of around 4,294 buses and operate around 10.38 lakh km on a daily basis.The public transport is off the roads due to a nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of coronavirus.The bus hike is much below the 25 per cent increase carried out in 2010-11 and 20 per cent increase in 2012-13, the statement said.In another decision, the cabinet accorded approval to partially restore the VAT on diesel and petrol prices and decided to put a complete ban on the purchase of new vehicles, including cars and jeeps, except buses for public transport and vehicles used for emergency responses during the current financial year.The increase in rate of tax would be Rs 1 per litre on petrol and Rs 1.1 per litre on diesel, it said.The Haryana Cabinet also decided to impose one per cent market fee and Haryana Rural Development Fund cess on sale of fruits and vegetables in mandis.The Congress said other governments were putting money in people’s hand during the crisis but the BJP-JJP government was doing the opposite.“Today, Khattar Cabinet wrote a Black Chapter of anti-people measures! Govts are putting more money in people’s hands everywhere but BJP-JJP Govt forces & fleeces daily,” Congress’ chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala tweeted.Surjewala said tax of “Rs 1.10 per litre on petrol/diesel, bus fare hike & Market fee on fruits and veggies is the new ‘JaJia Tax’!”.Haryana Congress president Kumari Selja also slammed the Khattar government’s move to “burden people” in the time of a crisis.Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar had recently said that Haryana has been losing a whopping Rs 4,600 crore revenue.Khattar in a televised address had said “we will have to curtail our expenses and generate sources of income”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/haryana-hikes-bus-fare-vat-on-diesel-petrol-prices-congress-slams-move/story-GacM7BTBKqqEYxZDCOH1vN.html
01-05-2020||India||India has stepped up as a leader in fight against coronavirus, says US Congressman Holding||India has stepped up as a leader in the fight against coronavirus, an influential American lawmaker said Thursday applauding, New Delhi for providing the US with vital supplies such as mass quantities of Hydroxychloroquine. “The Republic of India is one of America’s closest and most important allies, and our relationship has always enjoyed bipartisan support in Washington, D.C.. I am thankful that India has stepped up as a leader in the fight against coronavirus, and am glad that our special partnership remains strong during this pandemic,” Congressman George Holding, the co-chair of the Congressional Caucus on India and Indian-Americans, said.In a statement, the influential Republican lawmaker from North Carolina also appreciated the role being played by Indian-American non-profit organizations and community organizations in the pandemic relied work in the US.“On the US soil, Sewa International (an India-based service organization) has been working tirelessly to donate masks, provide meals to first responders, and ensure vulnerable populations have access to food and medicine throughout the country,” Holding said.Sewa has also provided support systems by hosting informative conference calls, while Indo-American hoteliers have stepped up and donated temporary housing to Indian international students in the United States, he added.Holding said the Indian government has been hard at work both in their country and in the United States to help the international community fight COVID-19. “It’s amazing to see how one of our closest and most important partners can have such an impact in our country from nearly ten thousand miles away,” he said.Together, the Indian and US governments have been able to identify measures necessary to propel us forward in the fight against this pandemic, Holding said.India has shown that they are committed to keeping key supply and logistics chains open for pharmaceutical and medical products – benefitting both the United States and India’s own regional neighbours, he added.“In early April, Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi and President Trump worked together to overcome the challenges that international trade faces amidst national lockdowns. Since then, India has provided the United States with vital supplies such as mass quantities of Hydroxychloroquine,” said the Republican lawmaker.Observing that the US-India partnership has also directly impacted the lives of many Americans, he said as of April 16th, more than 1,500 American citizens have returned home to the United States from India thanks to the facilitation of Indian authorities.“It prides me to see that the sense of community supersedes borders and cultures during a time of international crisis,” Holding said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-has-stepped-up-as-a-leader-in-fight-against-coronavirus-says-us-congressman-holding/story-iUkjEGPLHZJnJyJ1lJmYtN.html
01-05-2020||India||PM Modi holds meetings to boost defence, aerospace sectors||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday held a series of meetings to discuss strategies to boost the economy amid the COVID-19 pandemic, and attract more foreign investments into India as well as promote local investments. He reviewed the state of investments, the defence and aerospace sector and the mine and mineral sector. An official statement said various strategies to bring investments into India on a fast-track mode and to promote Indian domestic sectors were discussed in the first meeting. The high-level meetings come amid the ongoing global backlash against China. Several companies are now looking for new bases to set up their businesses, according to reports. Detailed discussions were also held on guiding states to evolve their strategies and to be more proactive in attracting investments, the statement said. Reform initiatives undertaken by the various ministries should continue unabated and action should be taken in a time-bound manner to remove any obstacles which impede promotion of investment and industrial growth, the statement said, citing the discussions. The meeting also discussed that a scheme should be developed to promote more “plug and play” infrastructure in the existing industrial lands, plots or estates in the country and provide necessary financing support. During the meeting, Modi directed all concerned that action should be taken for a more proactive approach to “handhold” the investors, to look into their problems and help them in getting all the necessary central and state clearances in a time-bound manner. Given the increasingly worrying economic uncertainty, the government has moved to reassure both global and local investor community with focus on encouraging infrastructure and manufacturing sector investments. While chairing the meet on defence and aerospace, he said India should reduce dependence on imports and take forward the “Make in India” initiative to build its domestic capabilities for designing, developing and manufacturing state-of-the-art defence equipment. The meeting also discussed the potential reforms to ensure a robust and self-reliant defence industry in India that caters to short and long term needs of the armed forces. The meet also discussed initiatives to give a boost to the economy in the backdrop of COVID-19, an official statement said. The discussions involved reforming of the functioning of the ordnance factories, streamlining procurement procedures, focused resource allocation and encouraging research and development. Attracting investment in critical defence technologies and promotion of exports also came up in the meet. The prime minister laid emphasis on positioning India among the top countries of the world in defence and aerospace sectors, from design to production, with active participation of public and private sector fulfilling the twin objectives of self-reliance and exports. He reviewed the proposed reforms for attracting domestic and foreign investment in defence sector. It was discussed that defence expenditure be “economised” and the savings be channelised for strategic defence capital acquisition. Reviewing the mines and mineral sector, Modi laid special focus on improving the country’s self-reliance in production of minerals and their in-country processing. Auctioning of additional blocks, encouraging wider participation in auctions, increasing the production of mineral resources, reducing the cost of mining and cost of transporting formed part of the discussion. The deliberations also focussed on increasing ease of doing business while also reducing carbon footprint with environmentally sustainable development.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-holds-meetings-to-boost-defence-aerospace-sectors/story-KodxmGBCHdj6pxFSZuVJtN.html
01-05-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||Kerala gets a lot of good press for its response to Covid-19. I have a hypothesis on that, but it can wait — perhaps for another column, perhaps forever.There’s no denying Kerala has done well, but so have Tamil Nadu, Delhi, and Uttar Pradesh. I pick these three states and not other states that have done well (Karnataka, Haryana and Odisha, for instance) for one reason — all had something that went against them.Delhi and Tamil Nadu, in that order, suffered the most from the irresponsibility of the Tablighi Jamaat, which insisted on hosting a weeks-long gathering at its headquarters in Delhi in March, a gathering that was attended by missionaries from some Covid-19-affected countries. And UP is, well, UP, the U in the late Ashish Bose’s coinage BIMARU, to refer to India’s most underdeveloped states in the 1980s, and also the most populous state in the country.Delhi’s dashboard, on Wednesday night, showed 3,439 cases, 1,092 recoveries, and 56 deaths. The corresponding numbers for Tamil Nadu were 2,162, 1,210, and 27. And for UP – 2,134, 510, and 39. In terms of recoveries and deaths, all three states have done well. Kerala’s numbers on Wednesday (for an easy comparison) were 495 cases, 369 recoveries, and 3 deaths.Sure, UP lags on the testing front — just around 360 per million population, according to the latest data — but Tamil Nadu (almost 1,500) and Delhi (almost 2,400) fare well on this count too. Tamil Nadu’s performance isn’t a surprise — for decades now, the state’s social development indicators have been among the best in the country. Nor is Delhi’s — it is the national capital, after all, and administered by a progressive government. UP is a surprise, a pleasant one, which merits deeper study. Its social development indicators remain in the red, and it is vast, in terms of geography as well as population. Yet it has managed to keep its Covid-19 numbers under control.Delhi’s performance is at odds with how it has been treated by its neighbours. Both UP and Haryana are pushing for a hard border with the national capital, worried that people who live in UP and Haryana, and work in Delhi (there are many) or the other way round (there are perhaps as many) pose a risk. Local administrators, even ministers, have spoken of people who get infected in Delhi and carry it across the border.Sure, these aren’t the only states to want hard borders with neighbours — in the past month, Karnataka has pushed for one with Kerala (the latter complained); Kerala then wanted one with Tamil Nadu (the latter complained); and Tamil Nadu wanted one with Andhra Pradesh (the latter complained). But Delhi’s situation is different.It is different because Delhi is the epicentre of the National Capital Region which includes parts of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. The urban and economic development seen in parts of these states bordering Delhi is simply because of that — proximity to the capital city-state. Gurugram is a city in its own right, but it is unlikely to have become the base for the India HQs of a few hundred Fortune 500 companies were it located deeper inside Haryana, say, near Sonipat (which too is part of NCR). The same is true for Noida, which is yet to graduate from being a Delhi-satellite, though that too should happen in a few years.There are other urban agglomerations in India — the Mumbai Metropolitan Region which includes several satellite towns in Maharashtra is one — and for years now, governments have struggled with how to manage them. The latest episode involving Delhi, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh needs to be seen in that context. And, to the long list of personal, organisational, and governance improvements we need to focus on when this is all over, we can add one more — a better way to manage urban agglomerations across districts within the same state, and across several states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-sdb9tW3aolYcx98I1Jn7YL.html
01-05-2020||India||As countries battle curbs, India keeps up diplomatic ties||External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Thursday kicked off a detailed interaction with Indian envoys abroad to compare notes on the battle against Covid-19, its impact on India and the road ahead. This is Jaishankar’s second round of discussions with top Indian diplomats overseas.A recurring theme in Jaishankar’s last interaction on March 20 was to urge the envoys to tell Indians stranded abroad to stay put where they were and not to panic; he also asked them to look around to secure medical equipment supplies that India would need.The government’s evacuation plan to bring the stranded Indians home over the next few weeks could figure in Thursday’s interaction with the Indian envoys. Jaishankar has started with envoys from the Asia-Pacific region -- Jaoan, Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Paua New Guinea. South-East Asian countries will be next and then, South Asia. Jaishankar isn’t the only one talking. Top external affairs ministry officials are holding a parallel global outreach campaign, interacting with foreign envoys posted in New Delhi. The foreign envoys are being told how India is fighting the Sars-CoV-2 pathogen that causes Covid-19.Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageIndian diplomats are also taking notes on how other countries have dealt with the virus that has, in just about four months, killed 225,000 people, infected over 3 million, driven countries to go into lockdown mode and threatened to push the global economy into a recession. Diplomacy couldn’t afford to go in lockdown mode. Instead, it went virtual, shifted gears and moved into an overdrive, a foreign ministry official told Hindustan Times.Prime Minister Narendra Modi set the template early in the crisis and has been working the phones to scale up India’s diplomatic engagement with the world. That he had also held a video conference with the heads of Indian missions on 30 March was one step in this direction.In the next 30 days, PM Modi spoke to leaders of 30 countries. Ditto for Jaishankar ,who has kept pace with the prime ministers and reached out to his counterparts even in countries that may have been assumed to be off New Delhi’s radar. Grenada, a tiny Caribbean island - one of the smallest countries in the western hemisphere - has a population of just over 100,000. Comoros, a volcanic archipelago off Africa’s east coast, has a population of 800,000.Many of these calls were to offer support and help.Jaishankar told the G-20 foreign ministers’ conference this week that New Delhi is providing pharma assistance to nearly 85 countries on a grant basis, many of them in Africa, to support their response to the pandemic. There has been at least one occasions on which Jaishankar spoke to his counterparts in Russia, Brazil, the United States, Saudi Arabia and Oman in a matter of 24 hours. This was on April 23.Jaishankar calls it “virtual diplomacy”.“Strong friendships thrive even virtually,” he tweeted after wrapping up his video calls to leaders in five countries. The stepped-up efforts are designed to ensure that the diplomatic machinery doesn’t go into a stall mode but is kept primed for big action, government officials say..India will be moving into a lead role at the World Health Organisation next month when its nominee formally takes over as director general of WHO. Next year, India will get a spot in the United Nations Security Council as one of the 10 non-permanent members. The last time India made it to the UNSC was in 2012; Hardeep Singh Puri, the ex-diplomat in PM’s council of ministers, was then India’s face at the UN.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-countries-battle-curbs-india-keeps-up-diplomatic-ties/story-sraX6T805IarFUedXtNVhP.html
01-05-2020||India||Environment ministry on project clearance spree, activists wary||The nationwide lockdown which began on March 25 has coincided with the union environment ministry taking significant policy decisions on several large infrastructure projects across the country,, many of which have been opposed by scientists and activists for their ecological footprint.The environment ministry’s expert appraisal committee (EAC) held nine meetings only in April through video-conferencing where several industrial, mining and infrastructure projects were considered and cleared.Significant among them is the renovation and expansion of the existing Parliament building (part of the Central Vista) in the capital at at cost of Rs 922 crore. EAC’s decision on the project will be made public next week.The ministry’s Forest Advisory Council (FAC) met twice during the period and deliberated on extremely contentious projects -- the Etalin hydropower project ( 3097 MW )( which will involve clearing of rainforests in Arunachal Pradesh’s Dibang Valley ) and the clearing of the Nallamala forests in Telangana for uranium exploration. According to the minutes of the FAC meeting held on March 30, three independent expert members only confirmed decisions via email and that only the inspector general and director general of forests were present.The National Board for Wildlife met once on April 7 but considered as many as 34 infrastructure, mining and commercial projects linked or inside wildlife sanctuaries and reserves.Covid-related clearances“All ministries have been active but the environment ministry has been particularly active in expediting clearances for bulk drugs. Seven environmental clearances have been granted, six ECs have been recommended and 10 more drug proposals have been scheduled for EAC meeting on May 11 to 13,” said Manju Pandey, joint secretary (media) based on inputs from ministry officials. Her reference is to the Covid-19-related clearances that the ministry rushed through. Among other decisions, she added that a draft Environment Impact Assessment notification 2020 has been finalised and published for comments from public.She did not comment on the other projects. The environment ministry being in fast-track mode worries experts. Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher at Centre for Policy Research, said: “First, it has continued to receive and appraise projects in all sectors and not just those, which fall in essential services. If a project is approved, it will be without any on-site scrutiny. The ministry has also not withdrawn the draft amendment to the EIA notification, despite request early on in the lockdown and stronger demands that followed thereafter.” She added that there is also no clarity on “ how the public facing functions of regulation will operate (now) -- for instance public hearings, monitoring the compliance of safeguards like effluent discharge, pollution, encroachment or illegal operation.”Clearance to minesIn its March 30 meeting, FAC recommended that the validity of forest clearance be extended automatically for government-owned mines whose leases were renewed for 20 years recently. In a separate decision, FAC also issued guidelines that forest clearance of mines whose leases expired on March 31 can be transferred immediately to new lessees to prevent any disruption in mining output. Mining leases of around 40 mines expired on March 31 after they completed 50 years of operations. Experts questioned how previous environmental violations by these mines will be accounted for.Projects in biodiversity rich areasFAC considered two large and contentious projects in its April 23 meeting, the minutes of which are yet to be made public.One of them is forest clearance given to the Etalin hydropower project in one of India’s most biodiverse zones in Arunachal Pradesh’s Dibang Valley. The project will involve diversion of 1,150.08 ha of forest land and felling of at least 270,000 trees in subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forest and subtropical rain forests. Scientists working in Dibang Valley have written at least four letters, seen by HT, on how the project will spell doom for the region’s biodiversity and the Idu Mishmi people.FAC has also considered aN application for survey and exploration of uranium over 83 sqkm of forests in Telangana’s Amrabad Tiger Reserve. Following widespread protests by environmentalists and local people, the Telangana legislative council took a decision to not allow the project. But AN FAC status report shows it was slotted for consideration because the proposal by the Atomic Minerals Directorate for exploration and Research was pending.The National Board for Wildlife held a meeting on April 7 where approval was recommended to coal mining inside the Dehing Patkai Elephant Reserve in Assam; maintenance works for a road inside Namdapha Tiger Reserve in Arunachal Pradesh; drilling of boreholes for Sharavathi pumped storage and underground 2000 MW hydropower station inside Sharavathi Lion Tailed Macaque sanctuary in Karnataka; and construction and commissioning of Lakhwar Multipurpose Project (300 MW) in Dehradun and Tehri Garhwal districts by Uttarakhand Jal Vidhyut Nigam Limited .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/environment-ministry-on-project-clearance-spree-activists-wary/story-vv0oGyPPmtPlL6E8mIpZMJ.html

He also claimed that it would be better than consuming illicit liquor.Advocating opening of wine shops in the state, Bharat Singh has written a letter to chief minister, Ashok Gehlot. Singh in his letter has written since wine is a defamed product so neither the union government nor the state government will allow its sale during lockdown despite the fact that wine shops closure is breaking the backbone of the state’s revenue.Bharat Singh said that closure of wine shops is leading to increase in manufacturing of illicit liquor which is not only killing people consuming illicit liquor but also leading to huge losses of revenue for the state government.Referring to some media reports published in vernacular media, Bharat Singh wrote in the letter that 2 people in Halena region of Bharatpur have died after consuming illicit liquor on Thursday.He said that the Rajasthan government has also increased excise duty on wine.“Since Rajasthan government has kept target of recovery of Rs 12,500 crore of excise revenue from wine sale in the state in the year 2020-21 which does not appears to be accomplished due to lockdown so it seems the state government has increased excise duty to compensate such loss,” he said.Singh said that it would be better if the state government opens wine shops so that wine consumers will get wine and state government will also get its revenue.In the letter, Singh stated that “When Covid-19 can be killed by rubbing alcohol on the hands then alcohol will also kill the virus in the throat of wine consumers when they will drink it and anyway it is better than consuming illicit liquor.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-s-cong-mla-says-drinking-alcohol-can-kill-coronavirus-in-consumers-throat/story-k3BNo1xK4Z0WPehbKA6rvM.html

In the last four weeks, no new case has been reported and today the apartment is being de-contained,” Kejriwal said, according to ANI.He also said that his government was making arrangements to bring back the city’s students stranded in Kota in Rajasthan due to the lockdown.The Delhi Police and the state government were also working on modalities of movement of migrant labourers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-s-covid-19-tally-climbs-to-3-515-with-76-new-cases-death-toll-now-59/story-41Cs3N06L1fXNzBVbnLf2N.html
01-05-2020||India||Can’t locate UNSC listed terrorists in Pak, Imran Khan govt tells UNSC panel||The decision by Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan’s government to delete nearly 4,000 names from its terror watch list was part of a well-orchestrated effort to scrub its terror record clean not just at home, but also at the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), people familiar with the developments told Hindustan Times.Islamabad has told a visiting team of a UNSC monitoring committee that it had been unable to act against numerous individuals listed in its sanctions list because the UN panel had given “insufficient information”.The UNSC 1267 Sanctions List has 130 names from Pakistan.Islamabad, however, acknowledges the presence of only 19 of them including Lashkar-e-Taiba founder Hafiz Saeed. It has already moved the UNSC to delist 6 terrorists including Matiur Rehman, described in UN records of 2013 as the chief operational commander of terror group Lashkar-i-Jhangvi, a top official in North Block that houses India’s internal security establishment said.The UN analytical support and sanctions monitoring team, which was on a five-day visit to Pakistan in March, was told that the UN Sanctions List did not have the accurate date of birth, nationality, national ID number, passport number or a specific address of the men sanctioned for their terror links.Pakistan had put out a similar set of explanations when it was asked about the deletion of 3,800 names from its domestic terror watch list.In October 2018, Islamabad showed off this list to the counterterror financing watchdog Financial Action Task Force to demonstrate that it was coming down heavily on terrorists. This terror watch list, according to FATF records, then had 7,600 names of terrorists.Indian counterterror officials suggested that the effort to prune Pakistan’s terror watch list is a more recent development.The deletions were first spotted by Castellum AI, a New York-headquartered tech firm that tracks watch lists globally. In a statement in April, the tech firm started by a former US treasury department official said many of the names were removed sometime after October 2018. But there were about 1,069 names in the watch list that were deleted between March 9-27. Another 800 names were removed after March 27.“This means the process to delete the names started the day the UNSC monitoring team landed in Pakistan,” a counterterror operative told Hindustan Times. The UNSC monitoring team was in Pakistan from March 9-13.Indian officials said they had not been able to access the details of the UNSC panel’s visit but had learnt that the UNSC panel did convey, on March 18, that Pakistan could file requests for delisting “inappropriate” names from the UNSC sanctions list.Pakistan hopes to get the support of the Chinese in this endeavour given how Beijing had blocked an international effort to designate Jaish-e-Mohammad chief Masood Azhar as a global terrorist for years. Beijing eventually had to give in last year but started backing Islamabad’s attempts to include Indian professionals working in Afghanistan in the UNSC 1267 list.Also Read : ‘Brief the boss’: The backstory of Masood Azhar’s global terror tagThe exercise to get names of terrorists deleted, a top source in the internal security establishment said, appears to be driven by the desperation to stay out of the FATF’s black list. Pakistan has been on the terror financing watchdog’s grey list since June 2018 and faces the risk of being placed in the black list if it does not demonstrate that it was really acting against terrorists.“By getting rid of half of the proscribed entities, Pakistan authorities attempted to reduce its obligation to freeze the assets of such entities,” the source said.The FATF, which was due to review the status of steps taken by Pakistan, has pushed the meeting by four months in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.In any case, officials said, Pakistan had always kept out the most prominent of the terrorists that it supports out of the watch list.Top terrorist leaders who had been designated by the UNSC such as the Lashkar-e-Taiba’s chief operations commander and 26/11 Mumbai attacks mastermind Zaki ur Rehmani Lakhvi have always stayed out of Pakistan’s terror list. So did Dawood Ibrahim and others such as Mohammed Yahya Mujahid, head of LeT’s media department (sanctioned in 2009) and LeT co-founder and Hafiz Saeed’s deputy Hafiz Abdul Salam Bhuttavi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/can-t-locate-listed-terrorists-pak-to-unsc-committee/story-KLeSqlJd1186D1B8YGbeUI.html
01-05-2020||India||Cinema left poorer twice in two days: Rishi Kapoor dies||Rishi Kapoor, the versatile and outspoken actor from Hindi cinema’s illustrious first family of the Kapoors, died aged 67 at a hospital in Mumbai on Thursday after a two-year battle with cancer -- the second such death in two days that shook the country’s artistic fraternity and fans alike. Kapoor was admitted to the HN Reliance Hospital on Wednesday night after he complained of breathing problems. Actor Amitabh Bachchan was the first to tweet about Kapoor’s death. “T 3517 - He’s GONE..! Rishi Kapoor..gone.. just passed away.. I am destroyed!” Bachchan wrote. Kapoor’s family issued an official statement, saying: “...He remained jovial and determined to live to the fullest right through two years of treatment across two continents. Family, friends, food and films remained his focus and everyone who met him during this time was amazed at how he did not let his illness get the better of him. He was grateful for the love of his fans that poured in from the world over. In his passing, they would all understand that he would like to be remembered with a smile and not with tears... ” Kapoor was diagnosed with cancer in 2018 and went to New York for treatment. He returned to India after what he called “11 months, 11 days” in September last year and announced that he was in remission. He was cremated at the Chandanwadi crematorium at 4pm on Thursday. Kapoor is survived by wife Neetu, actor son Ranbir and daughter Riddhima Kapoor Sahni. His daughter got special permission to travel to Mumbai from Delhi but couldn’t make it in time for the funeral.Leading the tributes to the veteran actor, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said Kapoor was “multifaceted, endearing and lively” and “a powerhouse of talent”. The PM wrote on Twitter that “...He was passionate about films and India’s progress. Anguished by his demise...”Kapoor left behind a rich legacy from a career spanning over 50 years. His first-ever brush with the camera was when he was three years old in his father Raj Kapoor’s Shree 420. He appeared in the iconic song Pyaar Hua, Iqraar Hua featuring Raj Kapoor and Nargis. He had an important role in Mera Naam Joker (1970), for which he received a national award as the best child artist. Kapoor’s big moment of stardom came in his lead role in the 1973 hit Bobby. After that there was no looking back for the man film magazines referred to as the original chocolate boy hero.He starred in successful films such as Khel Khel Mein (1975), Rafoo Chakkar (1975), Amar Akbar Anthony (1977), Karz (1980), Prem Rog (1982), Coolie (1983), Saagar (1985), Nagina (1986), Chandni (1989), Henna (1991), and Damini (1993), among others. In the second innings of his career, Kapoor reinvented himself from a romantic lead to a character actor and essayed memorable parts in Kapoor & Sons (2016) and Mulk (2018). Friends recalled fondly how the actor had great zest for life and never shied away from airing his views.“I’ve had the honour of working with Rishi ji. A larger than life person, so outspoken yet so warm. We have lost a brilliant actor today. Still can’t believe it.. absolutely heartbroken. My prayers are with the family during this tough time,” said Kapoor’s co-star Madhuri Dixit Nene. “My heart is so heavy. This is the end of an era...” actor Priyanka Chopra tweeted, summing up the feelings of many.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cinema-left-poorer-twice-in-two-days-rishi-kapoor-dies/story-uH1zkah4jI4aWIQ3D1Zu3I.html
01-05-2020||India||States prepare to bring migrant workers home||A day after the ministry of home affairs (MHA) announced guidelines for states to bring back their residents — students, tourists, and migrant labourers; mostly the last — many states started work on Thursday on what promises to be perhaps the biggest such exercise seen in India, the return of over 10 million people to at least 25 states and Union Territories.There are multiple challenges involved.One, to do so without trains, which aren’t running now; states have demanded that special trains be permitted to transport migrants back, but the home ministry guidelines have, so far, only permitted movement by buses, on road. There is also no clarity on whether trains will resume after May 3, when the current phase of the nationwide lockdown ends.Two, to do so in the least possible time and maintaining social distancing norms — a travelling salesman problem raised to the nth degree of complexity.And three, to have adequate screening, quarantine, and hospital facilities for those who return, usually to the rural hinterland.Bihar building construction minister Ashok Chaudhary acknowledged some of this. In an interview to ANI, he said: “We have information about 2.5 million migrant labourers (from the state). If we follow social distancing norms, one bus can carry 15-20 people…” According to this calculation, Chaudhary said, up to about 170,000 buses will be needed to bring the workers back at the same time. Then, there are the unregistered labourers and students stranded across the country, he added.Chaudhary’s observations highlight the challenges every state is expected to face, albeit to varying degrees.The Centre, however, has indicated that a careful reading of the home ministry guidelines will reveal that there is an operative word which describes its scope -- stranded. A top government official, who is a part of the decision-making process, said that the order had made it clear that it applied to those workers, pilgrims, students and others who were stranded -- and it was not a “free for all”. “If a worker is at home, in say Delhi or Gurugram, where he works, it should not be counted as stranded.” This reading of the order means that arrangements should be primarily made for around 1.5 million people, who are currently housed in thousands of camps. The official quoted above said that this was conveyed to chief secretaries by cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba in a meeting last Sunday. “If the situation appears to be getting out of hand, the Centre can change the rules again,” he warned. But this may be a distinction hard to implement on the ground, for both categories of migrants, those who are in camps and those who are in rented accommodations but want to return, have registered with state governments. Any state will find it difficult to leave its own languishing in other states — especially not when they are restive and want to return.Hence, the planning is being done with an eye on all migrants who want to return, and clamour has grown for special trains with states such as Maharashtra, Jharkhand, Rajasthan, Bihar, Punjab and Kerala joining the chorus.“In the prevailing situation, bus journey is not safe. And there is a limit to maintain social distancing in buses. So we want the railways to run non-stop trains for them (workers and others),” Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said. Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot said special trains will facilitate faster return of the workers and backed the demand. So did Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh and Bihar deputy chief minister Sushil Modi.The railways ministry so far maintains that it has made no decision on running special trains, but an official said it is considering the proposals and awaiting a final word from the home ministry. “The home ministry will take the call soon. Phase-wise plans will be drafted by each zone based on the expected crowd,” the senior official said on the condition of anonymity.By the end of Thursday, several states, including Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal and Madhya Pradesh, announced that they have already appointed nodal authorities, as instructed by the Centre, to coordinate with others and finalise the protocols. They have also issued directions to district authorities to set up facilities for medical check-up of returnees at the border and housing them at quarantine centres. According to state estimates, about 10 million migrant labourers are stranded across the country, especially in states such as Punjab, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. The transport of migrant workers alone is estimated to require 500,000 buses if the Centre’s social distancing norms are enforced and they are transported around the same time.Uttar Pradesh announced its own plans to transport a million workers on Tuesday itself, a day before the guidelines were issued. And on Thursday, state officials said they will try to bring back most of the workers within a week. UP, India’s most populous state, has already brought back 270,000 workers from Delhi and Haryana. Its next challenge is transporting 1.5 million workers. Maharashtra, a favourite destination of migrant labourers — especially from eastern India — is housing close to a million workers from other states. The state government issued a notification on Thursday allowing the transportation of stranded workers, pilgrims and students. Other states will have to send buses to take back their residents. While Rajasthan, which has appointed 19 nodal officers to bring back an estimated 700,000 workers, sent a fleet of buses to other states, Madhya Pradesh additional chief secretary ICP Keshri said district authorities have been asked to gear up for the arrival of a large number of workers over the next few days.The mammoth logistical exercise is the result of the lockdown India enforced, with a few hours’ notice, starting March 25. It was originally expected to end on April 14 but was extended to May 3. The lockdown was aimed at slowing the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and giving India time to upgrade its health infrastructure. But it left an approximately 10 million workers adrift, and with no way to return home in the absence of public transport. Many lost their jobs. Some decided to walk back home. State governments set up relief camps to house the migrant workers but many remain restive. On April 13, a day before the first phase of the lockdown ended, following rumours about special trains for migrant workers, thousands descended on Mumbai’s Bandra station. Besides the migrant workers in relief camps, a large number of migrants are stuck in their rented accommodations, and may remain undocumented in the central list. With no sign of a premature end to the lockdown, some states such as UP decided to use buses to transport their workers from neighbouring states. Others, including Punjab and Bihar, sought guidelines from the Union government on this. The issue was also raised in the fourth meeting on the pandemic, in just over a month, between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief ministers of states on Monday. The guidelines were finally issued on Wednesday.The MHA order said migrant workers, students, tourists, pilgrims and other persons stranded in other states should be allowed to move. All states, the order said, should appoint nodal authorities who should register these individuals. The sending and receiving states should then consult and agree with each other about “movement by road”. Those who wished to travel have to undergo screening, and only those who are asymptomatic could proceed. The order said buses shall be used for enabling movement — and these should be sanitised and social distancing maintained in their seating arrangements. The states and Union Territories on the way shall allow the movement of such buses. It is clear that the process could take weeks. A bus can accommodate some 60 people; with social distancing, that comes down to around 20. And a Mumbai-Lucknow journey or a Delhi-Patna one (most migrant workers are from UP and Bihar) will need to cover 1,376 km and 1,085 km respectively.The states will also need to ensure the workers aren’t carrying the virus. And they have started the preparations to this effect. Every worker returning to Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan will be scanned at the borders and quarantined. After 14 days, buses will take them to their home districts only if they don’t have any symptoms of Covid-19. Those having symptoms will be admitted in hospitals. In Odisha and Chhattisgarh, quarantine centres have been set up in government buildings, such as schools and community health centres, in rural areas. “All district collectors have been directed to ensure that no returnee enters a village without being in a quarantine,” said Chhattisgarh chief secretary RP Mandal.Sanjay Jha, Bihar’s minister for water resources and the national general secretary of the Janata Dal (United), said: “The process of registration has begun. And once we bring them into the state, we will provide food, shelter and even utensils and other basic necessities to those in quarantine shelters or in isolation centres if they are found positive.”State officials also said the number of calls to their help lines has significantly increased since the Centre’s decision allowing migrant workers and others to return home.Abdul Rahim, 34, a construction worker stuck in Ranchi’s Lowadih area, called the West Bengal government helpline on Thursday morning. “They assured us that they would take us back very soon,” he said, visibly happy.An official of the Uttarakhand government, who did not want to be named, said: “The MHA guidelines will be followed. We have already started receiving calls from people on the help line that was launched just after the lockdown began.” (With state inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-prepare-to-bring-migrant-workers-home/story-wBQBMX4muFNuQ7kJREZViJ.html
01-05-2020||India||105 Covid patients dead in West Bengal||West Bengal chief secretary Rajiva Sinha said on Thursday that 105 Covid-19 patients had died in the state, 33 of them succumbing to the viral disease, and the rest to co-morbid conditions. The state government also reported 37 new cases on Thursday, taking to 795 the number of people who have tested positive for Covid-19.This new figure of fatalities was released six days after the state administration said 57 persons who tested positive for Covid-19 had died, and attributed 18 of the deaths to the disease and 39 to “severe co-morbidity.” Bengal is the only state that has formed a committee of doctors to determine the cause of death among Covid-19 patients.“Today I have received a report from the expert committee conducting audits into the deaths of Covid-19 positive patients. Altogether 105 cases have been examined by them, out of which they have said 33 died of Covid-19 infection. In 72 other cases, death was caused by co-morbid conditions and Covid-19 was only incidental,” Sinha said.Meanwhile, the number of containment zones increased. In Kolkata from 227 on Monday to 264 on Thursday, and in neighbouring Howrah to 70 from 56.A controversy has raged over Bengal’s way of listing Covid-19 fatalities, with opposition parties, including the Bharatiya Janata Party, the Congress and the Left accusing the state government of manipulating the number of deaths.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee had on Wednesday said that she and her government did not tamper with the numbers and that an expert committee of doctors was conducting the audit independently. Over the past two days, a new controversy haS been brewing over an official order from the superintendent of Murshidabad Medical College and Hospital asking doctors not to mention Covid-19 in the death certificates of patients who had tested positive for the disease.This government order from the medical superintendent-cum-vice principal of Murshidabad Medical College was dated April 25 and numbered Msd/MCH/MSVP/2006. While top health department officials remained tightlipped, the hospital superintendent, Debdas Saha, was transferred on Thursday.“The administration is trying to make the superintendent a scapegoat. The administration from the top is differentiating between the deceased persons to show a lesser number of deaths. There is a death audit committee for this purpose. The only mistake the super may have done was to put the government’s viewpoints in the writing,” BJP state unit president Dilip Ghosh alleged.Congress’ Lok Sabha leader and Berhampore MP Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury echoed Ghosh.Chief secretary Sinha, refusing to comment on the transfer, said the death audit committee had nothing to do with death certificates.“This committee was not doing any kind of audit in death certificates; it was auditing the cause of death,” Sinha said.Senior doctor Rezaul Karim, a leader of the West Bengal Doctors’ Forum, said that he had raised the issue of death audit during the chief minister’s meeting with eight doctors’ associations on Tuesday.“It is possible that a person testing positive for the presence of novel coronavirus in her/his body is not a Covid-19 patient. She/he may have no symptoms of the disease at all and might only be a carrier. But these fine differences could be part of academic debates within the boundaries of academic institutions. We told the chief minister that at the time of a pandemic, deaths of all patients testing positive for coronavirus infection should be attributed to Covid-19 in order to avoid confusion and controversy in the public sphere,” Karim said. On Thursday, senior Left leaders staged a demonstration in Kolkata to protest against the “manipulation in the number of deaths,” and alleged a scam in the public distribution system and mismanagement in reaching relief to the poor. They maintained social distancing while staging the demonstration with placards in their hands and faces covered with masks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/105-covid-patients-dead-in-west-bengal/story-UtV5ij5QzdI14tTzrJ4koN.html
01-05-2020||India||25% Gujarat cases from 2 zones in capital||One in every four cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in Gujarat has so far been reported from two zones of the Ahmedabad municipal corporation, with a population of 320,000, government data shows.Till Thursday, 4,395 cases were reported, out of which 24.50% cases have been reported from the central and southern zones of Ahmedabad. Of the total 1,713 cases reported from these two zones, most have been from Khadia, Dariapur, Shahpur, Jamalpur, Danilimdi and Behrampur, according to officials.Ahmedabad municipal commissioner Vijay Nehra said the wards from central and southern zones come under the Walled City of the district and have high population density. “On a scale never seen before in India, we sealed the old Walled City in a single day and surveyed more than 100,000 people. We adopted a strategy of cluster containment early on and were able to moderate the growth of virus in hot spots such as central Ahmedabad. Even at the cost of a rise in figures, we started aggressive testing and surveillance,” he said.An official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the municipal corporation took some time to react after the first case was reported on March 30. “Also, the lockdown norms were not strictly enforced in these wards,” the local government official said.Giving out details of Covid-19 cases in the state, health secretary Jayanthi Ravi on Thursday said the recovery rate considerably improved over the past few days. “We expect to see a lot of improvement in the next week or so,” she said.Following the guidelines of the Union home ministry, the state government has also started the process of identifying people of Gujarat stuck in other states. “Responsibility has been assigned to 16 officers of Gujarat to make arrangements to bring back stranded persons. The process will be carried out in phases,” said Ashwani Kumar, secretary to the chief minister.In Surat, a 50-year-old Covid-19 patient, who allegedly left the Covid-19 ward of a civil hospital two days back, was found dead on a bench outside the medical facility on Thursday morning, police said. Preliminary investigations and CCTV footage of the hospital indicated that the man did not go outside the hospital campus, located in Khatodara area, during the last two days, an official from Khatodara police station said. He was admitted on April 21 and a few days later, his wife also tested positive and was admitted to the same hospital.“As of now, we don’t know why he ran away in the middle of his treatment, where he went and how he died. We are carrying out a thorough investigation into it,” deputy commissioner of police Vidhi Chaudhari said.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/25-gujarat-cases-from-2-zones-in-capital/story-sv0LEgvnJn8nA0UUrnZSmN.html

Officials said the man was arrested from Baramulla district where he also owns a house.DySP Devender Singh was arrested along with three militants from the national highway at Qazigund on January 11 by a team of J&K police. The team was led by two senior J&K police officers. Police later said that Singh was escorting the trio to Jammu and then to Punjab.After the arrest , the case was handed over to NIA for further investigations; the federal investigating agency carried out a series of raids in different parts of Kashmir, especially in Srinagar and South Kashmir and questioned more than two dozen people. The NIA team also raided the house of Singh in Srinagar , his ancestral home in Tral and seized some documents.A senior NIA officer familiar with the investigations told Hindustan Times that a person by the name of Tariq Ahmad was arrested by NIA. “The arrested person is from Shopian who was also involved in helping militants.’’He added that Ahmad is a former panchayat member who was also in touch with Devender Singh. After his arrest, Singh was shifted from Srinagar to Jammu on a transit remand where he was questioned by senior officials of NIA.

01-05-2020||India||Maha guv asks EC to hold polls to 9 seats||A day after Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray spoke to Prime Minister Narendra Modi over phone and sought his intervention to end the impasse in the state over the former’s election to state legislature, Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari requested the Election Commission of India to hold elections for nine seats to the state legislative council at the earliest with a view to end the political uncertainty in the state. His call came shortly after he three members of the state’s ruling coalition Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi the Shiv Sena, the Nationalist Congress Party and the Congress wrote to the EC seeking the same. Council members are elected by members of the state assembly. The impending constitutional crisis in Maharashtra may be resolved if the EC accepts Koshyari and MVA’s request. It also means Koshyari is not keen to nominate Thackeray on the council as his nominee despite a recommendation from the state cabinet and a reminder that he do so. Thackeray was not member of the state legislature when he took oath as chief minister of November 28. As per the provisions under the Constitution, he was supposed to get elected to state legislative assembly or council within six months, that is by May 27. Thackeray planned to contest the election to the council as nine members were retiring on April 24. However the election was postponed by the EC due to the Covid-19 outbreak. On April 9, the state cabinet recommended that the governor nominate Thackeray on the legislative council as two out of 12 seats to the council that are nominated by governor were lying vacant. However Koshyari has not done this. A person familiar with the matter in Koshyari’s office said nominees are usually achievers in art, social service, literature and other fields and the governor doesn’t want to nominate politicians. Koshyari had also indicated that he would seek Center’s opinion on the issue since state cabinet had advised him to nominate Thackeray as a special case considering the current crisis.It was then that Thackeray chose to talk directly to Prime Minister Modi. Following communication between a close aide of Thackeray and an official from PMO, Thackeray dialled Modi on Wednesday requesting his intervention. On Thursday afternoon, two Sena leaders, party secretary Milind Narvekar--who was Thackeray’s intermediary with Koshyari--and urban development minister Eknath Shinde met the governor and handed him letters written to the EC by the three parties. Koshyari then immediately wrote to the EC requesting early election for nine seats to the council. Thackeray’s Shiv Sena fought the election in alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party but differences over power-sharing saw the two go their separate ways after the elections. The Shiv Sena partnered with the Natonalist Congress Party and the Congress to form the government. The call is now the EC’s. The election authority is likely to seek union home ministry’s opinion before deciding on the request.“The governor has made the request to the Election Commission to fill the 9 seats in the legislative council, that have been lying vacant from 24th April, with a view to end the current uncertainty in the State,”said a release issued by Raj Bhavan on Thursday evening.In his letter, Koshyari stated that the elections to the council seats can be held with certain guidelines.“Since Chief Minister of Maharashtra Uddhav Thackeray is not a member of either house of the State Legislature, he needs to get elected to the the Council before 27th May 2020,”Koshyari said in his letter.In their letters, the three members of the coalition have assured the EC that they would follow all guidelines regarding social distancing and other precautions that are required under the current circumstances.A Sena leader said it is likely that the election will be held unopposed once EC clears it.“The developments have happened in less than a day after Thackeray spoke to PM Modi. If the election to council is held now, it would be clearly following the intervention by Modi. In that case, it is likely that the four parties--three ruling parties and BJP-- informally decide on fielding nine candidates between them so that the entie exercise of getting 288 members of assembly to Mumbai for voting in the middle of Covid-19 outbreak can be avoided,”he added.“Today’s developments mean Governor Koshyari is not accepting state cabinet’s recommendation to nominate Thackeray to council. If the Election Commission holds election for council, the issue would be resolved but what if it doesn’t? Or what if it is legally challenged. The possibility of a constitutional crisis is not yet over,” said political commentator Pratap Asbe. “At the end of the day, these are political moves. Center will play a role in this episode and the outcome would be guided by political motive,”he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maha-guv-asks-ec-to-hold-polls-to-9-seats/story-SkthZ2R6A8q2JJBfT0c3BK.html
01-05-2020||India||This loss is irreparable: Rakesh Roshan on his friend of 44 years, late Rishi Kapoor||“Chintu (as Kapoor was fondly known as by his friends and family) and I were friends for the last 44 years. So, you can imagine that we have had a really long association – on as well offscreen. But now, within a flash of a second, it has all, suddenly, come to a full stop. Even now, when I think about it, his passing away is something I still can’t believe in. This loss is irreparable – as a human being as well as an artiste. I know that it’s an irreversible situation but I am still in a lot of pain talking and thinking about Chintu. He was a very dear friend and like a brother to me.After being close to each other for so many years, and being through all the ups and downs of life, I am feeling lonely as well as incomplete. We also worked together in so many films, and I don’t have to tell the world as to how wonderful and talented an artiste he was. We have lost an incredible actor. Personally, I don’t know how I will fill the void, especially since this has come as a sudden jolt to me and I am sure, to everyone else too. Everything around us will settle down eventually but may god rest his soul in peace.I last met him on March 15 at his [Bandra] house and had dinner with him without having any inkling that it was the last time I was seeing him, though I was constantly in touch with him on phone even when he was in hospital. He seemed his usual self even then. Not just me, I don’t think anyone expected him to go so suddenly. But the morning of April 30 came as a big shocker to me. I just pray to God that he may give his family all the strength to cope with such a huge loss.”Veteran actor-director Rakesh Roshan and Bollywood star Rishi Kapoor featured in box office hits such as Khel Khel Mein (1975), Jhoota Kahin Ka (1979) and Aap Ke Deewane (1980). Also, Roshan produced Kapoor-starrer Kaun Sachcha Kaun Jhootha (1997) and Karobaar: The Business of Love (2000).(As told to Prashant Singh)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/this-loss-is-irreparable-rakesh-roshan-on-his-friend-of-44-years-late-rishi-kapoor/story-0UqP6MCJFm9PlGzgWbgkaL.html
01-05-2020||India||65% of Covid deaths in India are men, shows govt’s data||Fewer women are dying of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in India as compared to men, and at least half of those who died were over the age of 60, according to data from the union health ministry. Of the 1,074 Covid-19 deaths reported from across the country till April 30 afternoon, 65% are men, which is in line with the evidence so far that Covid-19 kills more men than women.According to an April 22 study published in the peer reviewed American journal, JAMA (Journal of the American Medical Association), an analysis of 5,700 Covid-19 patients hospitalised in 12 hospitals in New York City showed that at least 60% were men, and of the 373 patients who were undergoing treatment in the intensive care unit (ICU), 66.5% were men. The most common co-morbidities were diabetes, hypertension, and obesity among critically ill patients.Age and underlying medical conditions, such as diabetes, hypertension, kidney or heart disease, are also being seen as risk factors for developing a severe form of the disease in Indian patients. As many as 78% of those dead were suffering from some form of chronic health condition, and 51.2% were above 60 years of age.Of the 51.2% of those above the age of 60, 42% are between 60 and 75 years of age, and 9.2% were above 75 years of age.“The data clearly shows that the elderly people and those with underlying medical conditions need to be extra careful as they tend to develop a severe form of the disease,” said Lav Agarwal, joint secretary, Union health ministry.India, however, is much better off as far as case fatality rate is concerned, with 3.2% of the total infected people dying. Globally, the current Covid-19 death rate is at 7.28%, with Italy having the highest at 13.60%. “The reason for older people dying is because most of them suffer from some form of underlying medical conditions that leads to their immune system not being able to fight off the infection as well as it does in younger people with no co-morbidities. They cannot produce quality antibodies,” said Dr Srikant Sharma, senior consultant, department of medicine, Moolchand Hospital, Delhi. With 8324 people of the 33,050 total infected people recovering , India’s recovery rate is 25.19%.The case doubling rate has also seen significant improvement since past two weeks, from 3.4 days to the current 11 days.Seven states have a doubling rate of between 11 and 20 days; these are Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Odisha, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, and Punjab.Another five states have a doubling rate between 20 and 40 days: Karnataka, Ladakh, Haryana, Uttarakhand, and Kerala. And four states , Assam, Telangana, Chhattisgarh and Himachal Pradesh, have a doubling rate of more than 40 days.“All these states have better parameters than the national average. However, even though these states are performing better, there still may be certain districts in these states that are reporting high number of cases, which is why we cannot afford to let our guard drop,” said Agarwal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/65-of-covid-deaths-in-india-are-men-shows-govt-s-data/story-4OiTHnr599KlijnCO4SrhN.html
01-05-2020||India||Interstate travel allowed only for stranded migrants: Official||The Union home ministry order that sanctioned inter-state travel is only designed to let people who are stranded reach home, a top government official told Hindustan Times. “The operative word is stranded”.The home ministry approval is primarily aimed at the 1.4 million people who have been housed in 38,000 relief camps set up by the government and non-profit sector, the official said, referring to reports that millions of people could travel from cities to villages.He said the order made it clear that it was for “migrant workers, pilgrims, tourists, students and other persons” who are “stranded at different places”.Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverage“If a worker is at home in, say Delhi or Gurugram where he works, it should not be counted as stranded,” the official said.The fine print was indicated to state chief secretaries at their video conference with Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba last week. The Centre did not explicitly spell it out in Wednesday’s formal order to give the states leeway to work out the procedures in accordance with the ground situation.But it is important that the states make sure that the situation is not allowed to turn into a free-for-all at any point.“Because if the situation appears to be getting out of hand, the Centre can change the rules again,” the official, who heads one of the empowered committees set up by the central government, said.The warning from the top government official comes after the Union home ministry relaxed its lockdown to permit migrant workers, students, tourists, pilgrims and others stranded in other states to go home.The relaxation came days before the end to the 40-day national lockdown on May 4. In the next phase, the Centre is expected to lay emphasis on revival of economic activity in the country’s green zones that haven’t reported Covid-19 patients, ease restrictions in the orange zone but keep the ban on movement of people intact in the red zones and its containment zones.It was in this context that the Centre decided against running special trains to ferry the migrant workers or others. Instead, Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla’s order made it clear that the journey home would have to be made in buses.It is a logistical nightmare to organise the large number of buses that would operate from one state to another. This is particularly the case since a bus can not be allowed to carry more than 20-30 passengers in view of the social distancing norms.In the face of a clamour from states to run special trains, the government is open to revisiting this. The idea of requiring people to travel in buses, a government official said, was to discourage people from travelling long distances.“The lockdown is going to be eased in a few days and the migrant workers should be able to get back to work in the green zones,” the official said.He explained that it would be unrealistic to expect economic activity to restart in the absence of the migrant workersThere was, the official said, an added advantage of letting only migrants in relief camps returning home.“They have been living in the state’s relief camps and have been monitored by state health authorities…. Since there haven’t been any reports of an outbreak of the disease in the relief camps, it is reasonable to expect that workers, by and large, in these camps are free of infection and the chance of the disease spreading through them in the rural belt is minimal,” he explained.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/interstate-travel-allowed-only-for-stranded-migrants-official/story-iO4ilt4JxmEJlzIKCR9RAO.html
01-05-2020||India||Covid-19 outbreak brings local shops to the forefront of e-tail sector||The Covid-19 crisis has spurred a new wave of online and phone commerce, powered by millions of kirana stores, or local mom-and-pop shops, small merchants, cycle-riding delivery men, distributors on scooters, even farmers. The coronavirus pandemic has shuttered mom-and-pop shops in the US. In India, these retail stores, rich on legacy business skills, are emerging intact, albeit a little bruised. The dependability, deep trust and unique relationships of these neighbourhood enterprises with millions of middle-class consumers have made them resilient and a darling for big tech. These shops account for 80% of the country’s retail sector.As a punishing lockdown broke the back of big online retail in Indian cities, the country’s 8 million kirana stores have kept supplies going, thanks to their human and often personal network with consumers, suppliers, vendors and distributors. Small stores have been able to home deliver goods profitability, or at least without incurring losses. One analyst, who did a survey for a large firm said on condition of anonymity that this is a surprising discovery. “They have well established rules. For example, no delivery beyond a radius 3 km. Some deliver using cycles. That makes economic sense.” On April 22, social media giant Facebook announced a $5.7-billion investment in Jio Platforms Ltd, owned by Reliance Industries Ltd, aimed at leveraging WhatsApp’s 400 million subscribers to connect small stores and consumers. According to a report by JP Morgan this week, with this, WhatsApp could soon offer a shopping option to users. “Our focus will be India’s 60 million micro, small and medium businesses, 120 million farmers, 30 million small merchants and millions of small and medium enterprises in the informal sector,” Reliance Jio said in a statement. When in January of this year, the world’s richest man, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, visited India, he too promised $1 billion in new investments to bring small businesses online.“So, how will this work?” asked Delhi’s Mohit Aggarwal, the proprietor of Santoshi Stores, when a surveyor called him this week, seeking to on-board his store on to a bigger online retailing platform. The surveyor was hired by a retail company that Aggarwal did not want to name. Aggarwal says he received an online tutorial that revealed an ambitious plan to bring millions of shops online. A dummy site explained how. The retailer’s site essentially acted like an online aggregator of hyperlocal mom-and-pops. After a shop is on-boarded, its inventories are monitored real time. While the front end connects the small shops to consumers, the back-end connects them to distributors. Consumers can click for orders and also send their shopping list via WhatsApp, which will also act as a payment transaction app. JioMart platform, the e-commerce venture of Reliance Retail, plans to have 5 million digitised mom-and-pop stores by 2023. Its mega deal with Facebook gives it a ready consumer base of 400 million WhatsApp users in India. The platform has started trials for grocery orders on WhatsApp in Navi Mumbai, Thane and Kalyan, according to a report by Credit Suisse Ltd. “The customer initiates the interaction on WhatsApp, checks out the grocery order on JioMart webpage, gets connected with a retail store on WhatsApp and then customer picks up the order from Kirana and pays in cash,”the report added. Analysts see a revolution similar to the one preceding it in the digital payments ecosystem. “On the one hand, JioMart could enable inventory and back-end supply chain for small shops, on the other, the WhatsApp platform could enable ordering and payment providing seamless customer experience,” Edelweiss Securities Ltd said in a report on the deal. Amazon India already features a “Local Shops on Amazon” to take local shops live. Flipkart said it is working with 37,000 kirana shops and ramping up further to “serve the new set of consumers who are more tech-savvy and want personalized services”.According to a report  by Deloitte India and Retail Association of India, India’s e-commerce market is growing at an annual clip of roughly 51%, the highest globally. “As more people join the internet economy (internet penetration is expected to almost double to 60% by 2022) and continue to get accustomed to their new online lives, the e-commerce industry is expected to grow into a 100 billion USD market by 2022,” said Sankalpa Bhattacharya, partner and leader, PwC India. The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), a traders’ lobby, and the department for promotion of industry and internal trade (DPIIT) have also decided to launch an e-commerce platform for local retailers and grocery stores, CAIT Secretary General Praveen Khandelwal said. CAIT has often complained about predatory pricing of large e-tailers. Its entry into the kirana game could level the playing field and bring more options to small stores.A federal push to free up agricultural markets, opaque and tightly controlled by layers of intermediaries, has come as a shot in the arm, said Amit Kakkar of Comtrade. He said the biggest upshot of the new push, from a consumer perspective, is quick deliveries and turnaround times because it is a hyperlocal transaction. Under the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee Act, farmers could previously only sell their harvest at designated markets. This rule has been suspended, giving farmers the freedom to sell to remote buyers.The new e-commerce model plans to get on board farmers and millers too so that it’s actually a farm-to-fork supply chain. Kirana stores have the right enterprising quality and a very loyal customer base. “The only missing thing was technology. This is where we come in to make them more efficient,” said Samarth Agarwal, founder and CEO of MaxWholesale, an online platform for kirana stores to place inventory orders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-brings-local-shops-to-the-forefront-of-e-tail-sector/story-zzY4Z7NRHfI9J9YWoyujMN.html
01-05-2020||India||Unique coronavirus mutation in Bengal, experts say too early to know its impact||After Kerala and Gujarat, West Bengal has sequenced the SARS-CoV-2 genome and identified one unique mutation in the S2 domain of the spike protein of the virus in all samples sequenced from the state when compared to those sequenced in the other two states and Wuhan in China. There is one more mutation in S1 domain of the spike protein, which is similar to what Gujarat has found. S1 attaches the virus to the cell membrane by interacting with host receptor while S2 mediates fusion between the virus and cell membrane , according to Uniprot which provides resources on protein sequence.But it is too early to say how these mutations will affect us, said independent experts. The paper, led by CSIR Institute of Chemical Biology, Kolkata, and the Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR) in Ghaziabad, said that five sequences from West Bengal have been deposited on the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) on April 27. Scientists compared the sequences from West Bengal with other sequences reported in India and with isolates of Wuhan origin.Authors explain in their paper which is yet to be peer reviewed published in Medrxiv, a pre-print server for health research that when a virus tries to adapt to a new environment and population it would change its genetic makeup to utilise the host’s body in favour of virus’s survival and propagation. Broad mutation profile of this protein from extensive genome sequencing from different geographical areas is key to designing effective antiviral therapy or vaccine.While the sequences from West Bengal do tell us they are different from those in Gujarat and Kerala, the knowledge is inadequate in understanding how that can impact virulence or disease.“There appears to be a new mutation in West Bengal, which hasn’t been described previously. Some mutations are important while some are not. It’s too premature to say anything. The spike protein is a hotspot for mutation. We need some real-life studies of how these mutations change the virus. Some of these mutations may affect the way the virus enters the body,” said Dr Shobha Broor, former head of the AIIMS department of virology, who has read the study. “There will be mutations. For example, the Kerala sequence was very similar to the one from Wuhan, the rest were similar to those from Italy. Mutations are critical, depending on where they are happening. For example, the receptor binding area of the RNA is important,” she added.There can be better understanding only though large scale global sequencing studies but for now it doesn’t seem like SARS-CoV-2 is mutating very rapidly or significantly. “The question is whether one vaccine will hit all viruses globally. It might or might not. That is to be studied by several groups globally. There are umpteen examples in case of measles, polio, Japanese Encephalitis where one vaccine managed to hit all mutated viruses globally. In HIV, there was an antigenic shift which is why one vaccine didn’t help. In Influenza, we see antigenic drift, so one vaccine cannot be of help but this paper doesn’t address these questions. The mutations in SARS-CoV-2 are unlikely to affect the critical part of the spike glycoprotein. As of now, one vaccine is expected to protect all,” said Dr T Jacob John, professor emeritus and former head of virology at Christian Medical College, Vellore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unique-virus-mutation-in-bengal/story-8E0zPECkt3K72PVCivEkxI.html
01-05-2020||India||Talks on to bring back stranded Indians: Govt||India said on Thursday consultations were on to finalise plans for repatriating citizens stranded around the world even as missions in different countries were arranging essential supplies and looking after the needs of such people.“The matter is receiving the attention of the government. It would be premature for me to spell out the plans for their return at this stage,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava told a virtual news briefing.Though Srivastava said he didn’t have details regarding the number of Indians stranded around the world or expatriate workers wishing to return to the country, people familiar with developments have said the number is expected to run into hundreds of thousands.Noting that the country has been under lockdown since March 25 and all commercial flights had been suspended, Srivastava said: “In this situation, there are Indians all over the world who have gone to various parts as students, there are deportees or they’ve finished their projects and they wish to return.“We understand that they are naturally inconvenienced and we appreciate their predicament…Consultations are on and discussions are underway [for their return].”Indian missions around the world are taking care of the stranded citizens by arranging food and shelter and addressing issues arising from their unplanned stay abroad, such as the expiry of visas, he added.Officials have already said the repatriation of Indian citizens is expected to begin once the nationwide Covid-19 lockdown eases after May 3. The exercise is expected to involve Air India, the air force and the navy.The air force is expected to use some of its largest transport aircraft, such as C-130s and C-17s, for evacuation flights while the navy has kept three large warships on standby to bring back thousands of Indians from West Asian countries.Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said on Wednesday that more than 56,000 people from his state had registered to return after losing their jobs in foreign countries.The external affairs ministry and Indian missions are expected to begin registering Indians who want to return in the coming days, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity.Secretaries responsible for various geographical regions in the external affairs ministry have held a series of meetings via video conference with groups of ambassadors based in Delhi during which the repatriation of Indian citizens and their welfare figured in the discussion||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/talks-on-to-bring-back-stranded-indians-govt/story-YTHXpPzw3126PoO0aH9a7L.html
01-05-2020||India||Across states, officials gear up to handle migrants’ return||Several states appointed nodal authorities and kick-started formalities to bring back their residents --- migrant workers, students and pilgrims, among others --- who are stranded in different parts of the country because of the ongoing lockdown imposed to stop the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak. According to state government estimates, there are close to 10 million migrant workers stranded in different states, who will travel back home by bus, in possibly the biggest such exercise India has ever witnessed. A ground report from 12 states.Uttar PradeshUttar Pradesh (UP), which has already brought back 2.7 lakh workers from Delhi and Haryana, is now gearing up to bring back another 1.5 million workers. Chief minister, Yogi Adityanath, on Tuesday spoke with the chief ministers of several states and asked for their help in the return of migrants to UP. The state has brought back from Kota, Rajasthan, 11,500 students (who had been there to prepare for competitive exams) and sent another 10,000 students to their homes in various districts.The UP government has appointed nodal officers to coordinate with other state government and district administrations to enable the return of migrants and to take care of them at geotagged shelter homes. An UP Revenue Department officer said capacity has been created to house “6 lakh person against the expected 10 to 15 lakh migrants” coming in. A police officer manning a helpline in UP said that the number of calls has increased and they were assuring workers they would be brought back soon. .Shiv Mangal, 28, a migrant worker who is living at a shelter/quarantine camp at Janaki Kund Junior High School in the Pariyar village in Unnao said: “We came all the way to be in our homes, and not to live here.” He, along with 19 others arrived—on their own—came from Telangana on April 19. MaharashtraWhile Maharashtra has a few thousand workers stranded in other states, it has close to a million workers from other states. Of these, around 5.7 lakh labourers are living in 4600-odd shelter homes in various districts of the state. State government officials said 1.7 lakh of them want to return.The Maharashtra government on Thursday issued a notification allowing transportation of the stranded workers, pilgrims, and students after taking permission from district authorities. Respective state governments will have to arrange for vehicles to take back workers. The 14-day quarantine has been made mandatory for the people arriving in Maharashtra. Nitin Kareer, additional chief secretary, Maharashtra, said, “We are not making any arrangements for the logistics, including their travel facilities for the migrant workers, who want to go back to their respective home states.” An official from the relief and rehabilitation department said there was fear of violent reaction after May 3 from these workers, in case the lockdown and restrictions are extended. “In Nashik, Palghar and Jalgaon and other parts of the state, we received complaints of the workers in shelters either boycotting the food or even threatening drastic steps if they are not allowed to go to their states. Some of them even try travel to their states on foot,” the official said.Madhya PradeshMadhya Pradesh has already brought back 20,000 workers. Additional chief secretary, ICP Keshri, said, “Besides, 7000 more labourers from Rajasthan, 3000 from Uttar Pradesh and 1600 from Goa are expected to reach Madhya Pradesh on Thursday.” Around 30,000 more have enrolled, he said, adding arrangements have been made for their food and accommodation. Naval Adivasi from Sheopur district, who was brought back from Nagaur in Rajasthan along with 50 other labourers said, “We were stranded in Nagaur. The state government has made good arrangements for us here.” There were reports of a few protests from Gwalior-Bind area, where workers were asked to stay in quarantine.Chhattisgarh and OdishaChhattisgarh’s chief secretary, RP Mandal, on Thursday asked collectors to update the figure of migrant labourers of their respective districts, who are stranded in other states and made the Chief Executive Officer of the zila panchayats in rural areas and the municipal commissioner and chief municipal officer in urban areas as nodal officers to coordinate with other states. He also told the collectors that the persons brought back will be kept in quarantine at the village panchayat level and would be tested for Covid-19, if they have symptoms. Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa and Telangana are transporting the workers from Chhattisgarh by buses to the Chhattisgarh border. From there, Chhattisgarh government will take them to their destination districts. “Till now, about 11 lakh migrant labourers from Chhattisgarh are found stranded in other states,” said a senior IAS officer, who was not willing to be quoted. In Odisha, the officials said arrangements would soon be announced for about 7 lakh workers from Odisha stranded in other states.Punjab and HaryanaPunjab has appointed a state nodal officer to coordinate the movement of migrants from Punjab to other states and vice versa. “An online registration system is also being started today on COVA app (a central app for all Covid-19 related information and management) to register migrant workers who are currently here and want to go back to their home states as well as Punjabis who are stranded in other states,” additional chief secretary, home, Satish Chandra, said.Not too many from Punjab are working in other states. The government estimates that around five million workers from other states are employed in registered industrial units, and brick kilns. Of them, around two million are in Ludhiana. Tarsem Jodhan, President of Punjab Mazdoor Union, said that lakhs of migrants here want to go back after the government’s decision yesterday. Like Punjab, Haryana has over two million workers from other states and officials said a team has been set up to coordinate with other states to send them back. Most of these workers are in National Capital Region towns such as Gurugram, Faridabad, Sonepat and Rohtak, officials said.RajasthanThe Rajasthan government has appointed 19 IAS/IPS officers to coordinate with governments of 14 states, district authorities and other agencies. The officers appointed will coordinate with other state governments to resolve issues of Rajasthani workers in these states and with districts officers in Rajasthan to enable workers from other states to return home. Orders have been issued to set up transit camps at the state borders, where quarantine centres will be set up for workers. Till Wednesday afternoon, a total of 23,019 labourers were sent to other states and 4,874 were brought back to Rajasthan.DelhiDelhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday said the government will come up with a detailed plan later this week and urged migrant workers in the city to stay indoors till then. “In Delhi, the main chunk of work is focused on sending back people to their own states. To send people back in safe conditions, adhering to social distancing norms, would be the priority if whatever strategy the government drafts,” said a senior official in the chief minister’s office. Delhi government is also making arrangement for bringing back Delhi students who are currently stuck in Rajasthan’s Kota.BiharA day after welcoming the Centre’s guidelines for stranded people, the Bihar government said it won’t be easy to bring back 2.5 million workers. Deputy chief minister, Sushil Kumar Modi, said bringing them back in buses would take several months and the journey for workers would be tiresome, in addition to the huge expenditure involved.Additional chief secretary, Amir Subhani, said the government will receive all the migrants returning to Bihar on its borders. “It is not written in the guidelines that Bihar has to send buses,” he said, citing the guidelines, which said that the sending and receiving states may consult each other and mutually agree to the movement by road. Another official said the other option was to bring them back in trains, which could be cheaper and quicker. Bihar has already appointed disaster management department principal secretary, Pratyaya Amrit, as the nodal officer for stranded people. JharkhandThe Jharkhand government has set up a team of 15 officers to coordinate with other states to bring back stranded workers. Johnson Topno, who is leading the state helpline, said about 9.5 lakh workers from the state are stranded in other states. West Bengal Chief minister, Mamata Banerjee, said the state was working on the protocol for bringing back migrant workers. The district administration has been asked to prepare the list of workers stranded outside the state. She had also promised to give Rs 1,000 to each migrant worker. The state government has already set up 711 camps in various districts where more than two lakh migrant labourers from at least 16 states have been put up.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/across-states-officials-gear-up-to-handle-migrants-return/story-SDu7NxMi8KqEl8GVlxNscM.html
01-05-2020||India||Humans provide the conditions for epidemics to flourish: Frank Snowden||In 2019, Frank Snowden, professor emeritus of history and medical history at Yale University, published a book that was a result of four decades of research. Called Epidemics and Society: From the Black Death to the Present, the book is a sweeping and exhaustive look at many centuries of humanities struggles with infectious diseases. And, as it turns out, it was well timed. “Each epidemic is unique, and each one tells us something about the society in which it occurred,” Snowden said in an interview over Skype from Rome, where he has just come out of home quarantine. “They shape history in profound ways.”Snowden termed Covid-19 as the “first pandemic of globalization”, speaking about the things that the disease reveals about societies now, the similarities with past pandemics and the ways in which all these have shaped public health. Edited excerpts:When your book came out last year, did you ever think that pandemic was around the corner?While researching the book, I had been listening to the warnings and I was very aware of the possibility—in the book I say that we have a ticking time bomb, because we live in a world of microbes and we create channels, because of the way our societies are structured, that microbes can exploit. I did think that I would live to see a pandemic like this, though I could not have known it would happen so soon. Anthony Fauci, who needs no introduction now, in a testimony to the US Congress in 2005 said that if you live in the Caribbean, meteorologists can tell you that you ought to prepare because a hurricane is in your future, it’s inevitable, though no one can tell you the date and how strong it will be. He said it’s exactly the same in the field of virology. Epidemiologists can tell you about the inevitability of a pandemic challenge, and that there is no reason to believe it will be less violent than the Spanish Influenza of 1918. We had these warnings but we ignored them to our cost and peril. My book came out in October, Covid-19 began in December. I came to Rome to do research only for the city to be totally transformed by this tragic event.I had a mild case of Covid-19, and as a result I’ve also been quarantined at home for three weeks, and today is the first day I have been released from quarantine. I’ve been daydreaming for days about visiting the market!Before I went into quarantine and I was still going to the market, what seemed interesting was the degree of compliance here in Rome. The lines in the markets were full of people talking about things like, ‘I wonder if this is what it was like in the last war’, or ‘could London in the Blitz have been like this?’ And the local newspaper had an article that said that this is the first time in 3000 years of Rome’s history that Romans have ever been obedient.What do you mean when you say we create channels that microbes exploit?The 19th Century was the era of industrial revolution and it created diseases transmitted via the oral/fecal route, cholera and typhoid, because industrialisation meant the sudden flooding of European cities by populations from the countryside for whom no preparations had been made and who overwhelmed the urban infrastructure. There was no clean water supply, no sewer systems, and huge dangers of contaminated water or food. Society at that time created an environmental niche for diseases like cholera and typhoid to exploit. I would define Covid-19 as the first pandemic of globalization. The niches it exploits are massive population growth, crowding and mega cities; an industrial model that encourages rapacious growth without counting the environmental cost. By destroying biodiversity and animal habitat, we are bringing human beings into relationships with animal reservoirs of disease that humans hardly encountered in the past. Spillover events are becoming more and more common. All the recent epidemics have been caused by it—Avian flu, MERS, SARS, Ebola. Then there is massive, 24-hour transport by air across the world. So, let’s say if there is a new virus in Jakarta in the morning, it can be in Los Angeles by nightfall. These are not vulnerabilities put upon us by god or nature. This is not a random event, not something out of the blue or a Biblical plague. Humans provide the conditions for epidemics to flourish.Can we ever be prepared for an epidemic?The history of the recent century of epidemic diseases is that whenever one has just struck, there is a flurry of responses, of devoting funds on public health. After a while people are tired of spending those funds and amnesia sets in.We have not taken seriously the need to prepare. We did not need to be vulnerable in this way, and the tragedy here is that this is a pandemic that has caught has when we were least ready and much of the suffering and death could have been preventable. South Korea were unusual in that they took the message to heart from their previous experiences, and met the challenge with readiness. We could all have been like South Korea. I have hope for a paradoxical reason. Covid-19 may well become endemic, and we may have to refigure our lives according to this new reality, certainly unless an efficacious vaccine is developed. One of the blows to the vaccine strategy that’s not much talked about is the discovery that people who recover from the disease do not necessarily have a robust immunity to it. The vaccine developers have to teach the body to do something that nature itself doesn’t do. The best vaccines have been for diseases in which those who experience the disease, small pox for example, develop lifelong immunity.If we are unable to take that route, then we have to reconfigure our cities, reconfigure our relationship with the environment, reconfigure our health care systems. None of that will happen soon. In the short term I am not optimistic and I do believe there are waves of the opposite, which is to find scapegoats, to blame immigrants, to put up national barriers. Xenophobia, nationalism…these are pseudo solutions to a real problem. Two of the leaders in the world in this regard, President Donald Trump in the US, and (Jair) Bolsanaro in Brazil—who is to say that they will not be swept aside by the failure of their approach in dealing with the disease? Nature may impose upon us the necessity to think in a coherent and science-based way if we wish our economies and our societies to survive, and I believe we do wish to survive.Is there a lesson in history about the lasting political effects left behind by epidemics? As a necessary measure, governments are exercising sweeping powers right now—what happens when the pandemic passes?It’s not easy to answer because there is no single lesson in history. If you look at the Spanish Influenza of 1918, it was largely forgotten. It was overshadowed by the war, by the Russian revolution, the peace making process afterwards… despite the fact that very strenuous and sweeping measures were taken—governments introduced compulsory masking, assemblages were forbidden—a great deal of what we are seeing now, happened back then, but nowhere did this disease lead to a rise in new authoritarianism. The powers enacted were set aside and life went on again.Sometimes epidemics can lead to liberating movements –Haitian independence and its relationship to yellow fever is an example. I think it’s dangerous to imagine an inevitable reaction or result as a legacy of Covid-19 because that would mean that it would be unplanned, and outside our control. In fact, what happens in the long run depends on us. It is possible to imagine the democratic or environmental consequences as being positive, but they won’t happen unless people put their heads together and insist that they happen. A crisis can also be a stimulant for necessary reforms. What effects do epidemics have on public health policies?One silver lining in the dark cloud of epidemics is the profound legacy it leaves behind on public health. The Bubonic plague shaped public health in Europe. If a Florentine from the 15th century were to come forward in a time machine to now, many of things we are doing would be familiar to him. There were plague costumes—gowns coated with wax and masks that doctors wore then. They had rods to keep people at a distance for social distancing. Also, the plague hospitals – overcrowded and struggling, with doctors and medical personnel being at great risk. He would have known all about quarantine, which was introduced back then.Or let’s talk about an English person with enormous influence in this regard — Edwin Chadwick, who brought in a sanitary revolution in England to counter cholera in the 19th century, retrofitting British cities with sanitary features – sewers, running water, the water closet – it transformed daily life. Regulation building codes we follow now are also gifts of the 19th century coming to terms with epidemic diseases.And we are all waiting right now with bated breath for a vaccine. Would we even have had the concept if it was not for Edward Jenner in the 18th Century developing the small pox vaccine?The word “unprecedented” is applied to what’s happening now quite liberally, but it seems to me that it has precedence going far back in history. The tools we are using, we would not have them without this history. Nor are the effects unprecedented – that people are losing some of their religion, and that religion may be a belief in rapacious global capitalism, or nationalism. A lot of belief systems are likely to be transformed, and this is not the first time it’s happened, and undoubtedly won’t be the last.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/humans-provide-the-conditions-for-epidemics-to-flourish-frank-snowden/story-u9sTv3lMa3IuWj5gNsgwwN.html
01-05-2020||India||India describes as ‘propaganda’ posts on ‘targeting of Muslims’||India on Thursday described a flurry of social media posts in West Asia on the treatment of Muslims in the country as “propaganda” and said countries in that region were keen to work with New Delhi for economic recovery after the Covid-19 crisis.Over the past few weeks, several commentators from West Asia and a member of the royal family of the United Arab Emirates have called out what they said were Islamophobic social media posts by a handful of Indians working in the Middle East. They have also criticised what they said was the targeting of Muslims in India.As the issue gained prominence, external affairs minister S Jaishankar reached out to many of his counterparts in West Asian countries, especially members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) to address the matter and also to discuss the welfare of some 8 million expatriates in the region.Responding to a string of questions on the issue during a virtual news briefing, external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava described much of the material on social media platforms as “propaganda by interested parties”.“Stray tweets cannot be used to characterise our bilateral relations with these countries, and the real picture of these relations is very different. The prime minister and external affairs minister have been in regular touch with their counterparts from the region, and spoken to them over the past few days,” he said.The West Asian states, he said, also want a “priority discussion with India on the post-Covid-19 economic recovery”.Srivastava added: “So what comes out clearly in these discussions is that these countries are deeply committed to friendly relations with India. They also don’t support any interference in the internal affairs of India. It is, therefore, important the friendly and cooperative nature of our relations is accurately recognised and the misuse of social media is not given credence.”The West Asian states have also made requests for India to send medicines and medical teams. “There’s a request to send doctors and nurses from India,” Srivastava said, adding that so far, a medical rapid response team had been deployed in Kuwait for a fortnight.India has also made special efforts to ensure uninterrupted supply of food and essential commodities required by these countries during the holy month Ramzan.Responding to a report that Oman, which is home to 770,000 Indians, has launched a drive to replace expatriates working in the government sector, Srivastava said this was a decades-old policy that isn’t “specific to India and doesn’t target Indians in any way”.Countries such as Oman “greatly value relations with India and also value the large and important role that our diaspora has played in contributing to the economic prosperity of that region”, he said. Oman has also been taking special care of Indians amid the Covid-19 crisis by providing them free testing and treatment, he added.Oman’s finance ministry recently issued a circular calling for expatriates employed in the government sector to be replaced by Omanis, with proposals in this regard to be submitted by July. The circular also said the replacement of expatriates should be done in a speedy manner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-describes-as-propaganda-posts-on-targeting-of-muslims/story-0HUYZOF8mDwTumjaf6SOjM.html
01-05-2020||India||Ayush ministry to study Ayurveda for boosting immunity||The ministry of Ayush (ayurveda, yoga and naturopathy, unani, siddha and homoeopathy) has started an observational study to establish immunity boosting effects of some Ayurvedic herbs and minerals on Thursday. The ministry will initially put Delhi police personnel on the experimental medicine for the study. “We have tied up with the Delhi Police to put their 80,000 personnel deployed in the field on this experimental medicine mix containing Giloy Ghan Vati and Chyawanprash as part of an observational study to see its prophylactic effects by altering a person’s immune response,” said Rajesh Kotecha, secretary, Ayush ministry.Giloy Ghan Vati contains extract of Giloy (botanically known as Tinospora Cordifolia), which in Ayurveda is known to be a potent immuno-modulator (immunity booster) herb.Chyawanprash is an Ayurvedic health supplement which is made up of a concentrated blend of nutrient-rich herbs and minerals. It is meant to preserve strength, stamina, and vitality.“As part of the study, this combination will be given to them on a daily basis for about three weeks. The dosage will be two tablets of giloy ghan vati in the morning, and two tablets in the evening, along with one spoon of Chyawanprash, in a day. In some cases we can also extend the period of study,” Kotecha said.Delhi-based All India Institute of Ayurveda will be the nodal medical centre for the study, he said, adding that the centre will also monitor the health of all study recruits.“We are not claiming it to be effective against Covid-19, all we are saying is that it is known to be effective in building a person’s immunity and we are conducting this large scale trial to see if it can provide some protection against this particular disease also. Another arm of this study is to see if taking this medicine will have any effect on the severity of the disease in case any of these personnel are exposed to the virus in future,” said Kotecha.“We want to generate adequate scientific evidence given criticism Ayush stream of medicines receive, and are collaborating with ICMR and CSIR in this regard. Like other observational studies taking place in the country with allopathic medicines, this study will focus on the effects of Ayush medicines,” said Kotecha.In next 10 days, the Ayush ministry will be collaborating with its regional institutes to expand the scope of the study to involve more people who are given these immunity boosters. “We are looking at covering about one million people including field staff, those in quarantine centres etc. especially in high-risk areas,” he said.The Union health Harsh Vardhan also said that the government was looking at using Ayush medicines to boost the immunity of people. “The Ayush ministry and ICMR are working closely, and about 125 proposals were received from various organizations that are being short-listed to conduct clinical trials so that their efficacy is proven in a scientific manner. We are open to making use of Ayush medicines,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ayush-ministry-to-study-ayurveda-for-boosting-immunity/story-aIZ96hgzUgJfDjJmbBDB9O.html
01-05-2020||India||Indigenous tests kits to be ready by mid-May: Centre||Indigenous antibody-based rapid test (blood test) kits and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) swab-based kits for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) developed by laboratories running under the ministry of science and technology will be ready around the middle of May, said health miniser Dr Harsh Vardhan.“The next couple of weeks are going to be crucial as we will get to see results of some of our research and development work by scientists working under the ministry of science and technology. Around mid May we will have indigenous development of good quality antibody test kits, and also kits for detection of the virus (RT-PCR kits). All of this will come in May; thanks to our scientists,” said Union health minister Harsh Vardhan.The institutes and companies collaborating on these projects include Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology, Thiruvananthapuram, Sri Ramchandra Institute of Higher Education and Research, Porur, Chennai, Central University of Kerala, and Dhiti Life Sciences Pvt.Ltd. The minister, along with Amitabh Kant from Niti Aayog, reviewed the work of various non-government organisations (NGOs) and civil society members involved in helping the government in managing the Covid-19 situation in the country on Thursday.The science and technology ministry is working on a number of other projects in the field of diagnostics, therapeutics or vaccine against the novel viral infection.“There is a varied range of projects, be it discovery of the new drugs or repurposing of the old or existing drug molecules for finding out solutions to Covid-19, or even looking at vaccine development, which our scientists are working on. We already have half a dozen vaccine candidates, of which four candidates are in a significantly advanced stage,” said Harsh Vardhan.Harsh Vardhan is also the minister for science and technology in the government. There are various laboratories under the department of biotechnology and council of scientific and industrial research that are into genetic sequencing of the Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes Covid-19.“The viral sequencing is happening at about 1000 labs across the country functioning under the department of biotechnology and at about 500 labs under the council of scientific and industrial research. A lot of things are happening; we are also supporting many new start-ups who have shown promise in the field,” said Harsh Vardhan. “The virus is going to stay with us for long, so we need to prepare accordingly,” he added.Experts feel it is high time India starts focusing on make in India products by encouraging domestic manufacturers.“…why should we depend on Chinese or products from any other country when we have the capability to manufacture indigenously? We should encourage Indian manufacturers by protecting their investments and creating a market for them. India has the capability. All we need is help in scaling up our capacity. This is the time to consolidate our resources and work like a single unit. It should be a consortium approach and not a competitive approach then we might even be able to export stuff,” says Dr T Jacob John, former head of virology department, Christian Medical College, Vellore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indigenous-tests-kits-to-be-ready-by-mid-may-centre/story-AoLiPzIiECeweofegZyqbO.html
01-05-2020||India||PM discusses investment models to boost economy||In the backdrop of the contraction in the economy due to the coronavirus pandemic and the national lockdown, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday held a “comprehensive” meeting to discuss strategies to boost the economy, with an eye on enhancing investment. The meeting took place even as the government is in the middle of finalising the first round of economic measures to provide relief to different sectors. This, officials aware of development said, may be made public next week.In a statement, the Prime Minister’s Office said that the meeting discussed strategies “to attract more foreign investments into India as well as to promote local investments in order to give a boost to the economy against the backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic”. Hindustan Times reported on Tuesday that the government plans to aggressively push the “Make in India’ programme by offering domestic and foreign manufacturers policy and fiscal incentives to manufacture locally. PM Modi, in his public speeches, has also spoken of increasing self-reliance at all levels within India. The statement on Thursday said: “Various strategies to bring investments into India in a fast-track mode and to promote Indian domestic sectors were discussed [in the meeting].” The meeting was attended by home minister Amit Shah, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, commerce and industries minister Piyush Goyal, minister of state for finance Anurag Singh Thakur and other senior bureaucrats. While there was no official word on the announcement of a stimulus, which has been demanded by various industry bodies, officials have indicated that the government will continue to take fiscal and policy decisions as and when the situation warrants, and the first set of measures could come next week as the lockdown eases. An official familiar with the proceedings of Thursday’s meeting said that the idea was to make India a global manufacturing hub, at a time when supply chains have broken down and the world is looking for alternatives to China to shift production bases. “The PM has always, from his first term, emphasised the need to improve India’s ranking in the ease of doing business. This has indeed happened. We now have to make a push to be able to leverage the opportunities that exist. This will also be our way to revive economic momentum.” He added that the government is working on relaxing regulatory norms, removing bureaucratic hurdles and providing fiscal incentives to both domestic and foreign investors.According to a second official, the government has been approached by many developed economies to prepare India as an alternative manufacturing destination because many multinational companies are looking to exit China. India’s main attractions, he said, are its vast domestic market, cheap labour, and a stable and decisive political regime.  The statement said, “It was discussed that a scheme should be developed to promote more plug and play infrastructure in the existing industrial lands/plots/estates in the country and provide necessary financing support.” During the meeting, the PM also, according to the statement, directed that the action should be taken for a more proactive approach to handhold the investors, look into their problems and help them get all the necessary central and state clearances in a time bound manner. Detailed discussions were also held on guiding states to evolve their strategies and be more proactive in attracting investments, it added.Industry bodies called it an apt policy at the right time and said India should strategically target each company which is relocating from China.Confederation of Indian Industry director general Chandrajit Banerjee said, “We suggest that these [investment zones] should be large zones with a special purpose vehicle to provide approvals and clearances, along with world-class urban infrastructure such as roads, worker housing and facilities, sewerage and low-cost power. Land and labour regulations can also be specifically instituted for these zones to ensure large scale employment.” Commenting on the possibility of boosting India’s domestic production capabilities, N Venkatram, CEO at Deloitte India said, “Swadeshi 2.0 is about manufacturing from India. This will happen if our own industrialists have the ability to invest in India, in turn encouraging foreign investment as well as manufacturing by foreign companies in India. We also need to look at changes needed in regulation and get the industrialist mindset back. We need to build our economy to its export potential based on our competitive advantages and generate employment.”Mithun V, partner at the law firm, Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co, said the move is “reassuring” for the global and local investor community. “This is also a very good time for the government to focus on encouraging infrastructure and manufacturing sector investments, especially given the ongoing global backlash against our land border sharing neighbour,” he said, in a reference to China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-discusses-investment-models-to-boost-economy/story-e1eoHeS2rIDjmcljVXOeCN.html
01-05-2020||India||The four quarantines of Praveen Burathi||A 25-year-old man took nearly two months to reach his home in the Champawat district of Uttarakhand from Tehran, capital of Iran amid the Covid-19 outbreak. In the process, he was quarantined once in Iran and twice in Rajasthan. And on Tuesday, when he reached Champawat, it was only to be quarantined again. Praveen Burathi, a resident of Khatoli, a village 40 km from Champawat works as a navigation officer at a shipping company in Tehran. He was sanctioned two months’ leave by his company but the flight he was to take on February 28 was cancelled.“ When I reached Tehran airport on February 28, I was informed that flight for Delhi was cancelled due to Covid-19 outbreak . I was told there was no certainty when the next flight would leave for India,” said Burathi.He contacted the Indian embassy in Tehran. “ I was advised by officials that I would be quarantined in a hotel till the next flight was available. I remained in quarantine till March 14 and my sample was taken by Iranian officials, which tested negative on March 16.”The quarantine was necessary because Iran was among the earliest to be hit hard by the viral pandemic. One he cleared the quarantine, he was put on the next flight to India. “Finally I boarded an Air flight for Delhi with r 195 other Indians on March 18 from Tehran. After we reached Delhi we were taken to Jaisalmer in Rajasthan through two domestic flights and quarantined there for 14 days,” Burathi said.Every Indian flown in from countries ravaged by the virus -- China and Iran, for instance -- were placed in manatory quarantine. After completion of the quarantine period, their samples were taken again for Covid-19 testing on March 31. “The report was received on April 5, which showed two people tested positive for COVID-19. So we all were quarantined again for 14 days at the same centre. We completed the second quarantine period on April 19, when samples were again sent for the testing”, Burathi said.That report came in negative on April 23; he and the others were free to go. “But it took me three more days to obtain a movement pass from the authorities in Jaisalmer. Then, I hired a taxi for Rs 30000 and left for Champawat,” said Burathi.Burathi reached Champawat on Tuesday and went to the local police station to inform them about his arrival as is the practice during the lockdown. Once he told them about his travel history, he was quarantined again in a local hotel for 14 days.The chief medical officer of Champawat district Dr RP Khanduri said: “Though we are quarantining (all) people who come from outside the state, given this man’s travel history we are being extra cautious. After he completes his quarantine period, his samples will be sent for testing. If they come negative, he will be sent home and advised to stay there.” In Uttarakhand, where 57 people have tested positive for COVID-19 so far, 11,120 people have been home quarantined and 2,218 have been quarantined in various institutions . “I so badly want to go home,” said Burathi. “This is the longest and most tiresome journey I have taken so far in my life.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-four-quarantines-of-praveen-burathi/story-WvXJDVfppl0MXKb8STR5BO.html
01-05-2020||India||Covid 19 update: Empowered panels reshuffled after bureaucratic rejig||The recent bureaucratic reshuffle in which about 30 senior officials were either shifted or promoted, has resulted in a mini-rejig in the 11 empowered groups formed to give policy inputs to the Prime Minister’s Office on Covid-19.Senior government officials, familiar with the matter, said many members of the groups will be replaced with new faces as a result of the reshuffle. “When the groups were formed, specific bureaucrats were assigned tasks under various heads. But now, secretaries who have replaced them will take over their responsibilities from there,” said a secretary-level official on condition of anonymity.Pawan Agarwal, the former consumers affairs secretary, was a member of the panel on economic and welfare measures. He, however, has been shifted as special secretary logistics. Similarly, former rural development secretary Rajesh Bhushan, now OSD in health ministry, has been replaced by the new rural development secretary Nagendra Nath Sinh, who will be a new member in the economy panel.An official added that while the panels are tasked with several aspects of the pandemic, they will continue to function even after the lockdown is eased till the virus subsides.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/empowered-panels-reshuffled-after-bureaucratic-rejig/story-2kO2ZQqwBNHdQ89uqJJ5fO.html

These flights will take the total number of chartered flights so far to 59 and once they are completed, more than 15,000 British travellers will have been evacuated from India.A statement from the UK high commission said the seven flights would be operated from Amritsar to London on May 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11.The UK minister of state for South Asia and the Commonwealth, Tariq Ahmad, said: “Our charter programme has already helped more than 10,000 British travellers return home from India by ensuring flights to the UK have run every day since April 8…I would like to thank the government of India for their help in making it happen.”This is the fifth round of charter flights organised by the UK for Britons stranded in India. The UK government allocated £75 million for special charter flights to priority countries such as India, with the focus on helping the most vulnerable people....||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/60-000-foreigners-evacuated-uk-to-fly-back-2k-citizens/story-Mtvnf3Cfw4mhcOOqWIeH2J.html
01-05-2020||India||MHA tells states to aid plying of trucks||The Union home ministry on Thursday wrote to all states and Union territories directing them against stopping the movement of trucks and other goods carriers even if they are empty. The direction was issued amid reports that trucks were still not allowed to move freely and there were disruptions in the movement of essential items.In the letter, Union home secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla said that local administrations “should not insist” on separate passes from the truckers and that field agencies be informed about these instructions so that there is no ambiguity at the ground level. Bhalla said free movement of trucks through interstate borders “is essential for maintaining the supply chain of goods and services across the country during the lockdown period”.This is Bhalla’s third such letter citing Covid-19 lockdown guidelines that say all goods traffic be allowed to ply. The previous two letters were written on April 3 and 12 and asked local authorities to follow the orders in letter and spirit.Clause 12 of the revised consolidated guidelines issued on April 15 allows “the movement of all trucks and other goods/carrier vehicles with two drivers and one helper subject to the driver carrying a valid driving licence, an empty truck/vehicle will be allowed to ply after the delivery of goods, or for pick up of goods”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mha-tells-states-to-aid-plying-of-trucks/story-MuRLqHQZPCOP4C6haoDNMI.html
01-05-2020||India||States get to work to bring back students, migrant workers home||Several states have set in motion the process of compiling data and coordinating efforts to bring home stranded migrant workers, tourists and students, a day after the ministry of home affairs issued guidelines on the protocol to follow for their transportation.Even as there is pressure from several states such as Maharashtra, Jharkhand and Rajasthan to start special trains for transporting people, the centre for now has allowed movement only in buses.Though the ministry of railways has said it has made no decision on running special trains thus far, an official said the ministry is working out plans on deploying special trains, contingent on the decision by the home ministry.“The Home ministry will take the call soon. Phase-wise plans will be drafted by each zone based on the expected crowds,” a senior official said on condition of anonymity.Bihar, which had insisted on a central guideline on the movement of people during the lockdown, has appointed the secretary of its disaster management authority as the nodal officer to coordinate with other state governments.The state too has made the request for starting special trains to make the process of transportation easier.Bihar deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar on Thursday also appealed to Centre for special trains to bring back migrants. “I appeal GOI to allow special trains to bring migrants from distant places,” he tweeted.The Bihar administration has announced that it will enforce quarantining for migrant workers at facilities set up at the block level across the state. Students and tourists will be screened and allowed to quarantine at home if they are found asymptomatic. “The process of registration has begun. And once we bring them into the state we will provide food, shelter and even provisions such as utensils and other basic necessities to those in quarantine shelters or in isolation centres if they are found positive,” said Sanjay Jha, minister of water resources and the national general secretary of JD(U).The minister also said that the state will take penal action against anyone, willfully breaking protocol and entering the state without following the due process.The state, which has received about 28 lakh requests from workers stranded outside Bihar for getting Rs 1,000 transferred by the state government through direct transfer, will develop an app to create a data bank of those who need to be transported back from across the country.In Uttarakhand, where officials have received the most calls from stranded persons in Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat; efforts are underway to organise buses for their transportation.“The MHA guidelines will be followed. We had already been receiving calls from people on the helpline that was started just after the lockdown began; but now we will start taking requests afresh,” said an official of the Uttarakhand government.Though states such as UP and MP had begun the process of bringing back stranded domiciled residents, Bihar and Jharkhand had insisted that the Centre should draft a common guideline for all states to follow so that the provisions of the disaster management act that is in force are not violated.In UP, an official said arrangements are nearly ready to set up a quarantine facility and a community kitchen for 10 lakh people. “Between March 28 and 29 we brought 4 lakh people from Delhi, nearly 50,000 from Haryana and Rajasthan; we also brought back students from Kota. The state chief secretary has written to all other states to inform us about our residents there and what kind of help is needed so that we can make arrangements,” said an official in UP.UP chief minister, Yogi Adityanath has also urged migrants not to undertake their journey on foot and said that the UP government is preparing an action plan for the safe return of all.On whether the state will wait for the special trains to start before bringing back people, the Uttarakhand official said the administration will “stick to the MHS guidelines” and start the process of transportation using buses. As part of its internal brain-storming exercise, some railway officials have also drafted a paper titled ‘Facilitating Migrants Travel’, suggesting free-of-cost travel, ensuring social distancing, close coordination with states, movement of migrants in phases using a cluster-based approach.A meeting was held by senior home ministry officials with the railway board and RPF officials Thursday according to an official aware of the development. A decision on running special trains may be taken following home ministry and the Prime Minister’s nod.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-get-to-work-to-bring-back-students-migrant-workers-home/story-GuBlI0ySB7Qw8HQvXa6pCL.html
01-05-2020||India||In Centre’s 2-page order on letting migrants travel, there is 1 operative word||The Union home ministry order that sanctioned inter-state travel is only designed to let people who are stranded reach home, a top government official told Hindustan Times. “The operative word is stranded”.The home ministry approval is primarily aimed at the 14 lakh people who have been housed in 38,000 relief camps set up by the government and non-profit sector, the official said, referring to reports that millions of people could travel from cities to villages.He said the order made it clear that it was for “migrant workers, pilgrims, tourists, students and other persons” who are “stranded at different places”.“If a worker is at home in, say Delhi or Gurugram where he works, it should not be counted as stranded,” the official said.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe fine print was indicated to state chief secretaries at their video conference with Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba last week. The Centre did not explicitly spell it out in Wednesday’s formal order to give the states leeway to work out the procedures in accordance with the ground situation.But it is important that the states make sure that the situation is not allowed to turn into a free-for-all at any point.“Because if the situation appears to be getting out of hand, the Centre can change the rules again,” the official, who heads one of the empowered committees set up by the central government, said.The warning from the top government official comes after the Union home ministry relaxed its lockdown to permit migrant workers, students, tourists, pilgrims and others stranded in other states to go home.Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreakThe relaxation came days before the end to the 40-day national lockdown on May 4. In the next phase, the Centre is expected to lay emphasis on revival of economic activity in the country’s green zones that haven’t reported Covid-19 patients, ease restrictions in the orange zone but keep the ban on movement of people intact in the red zones and its containment zones.It was in this context that the Centre had decided against running special trains to ferry the migrant workers or others. Instead, Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla’s order made it clear that the journey home would have to be made in buses.It is a logistical nightmare to organise the large number of buses that would operate from one state to another. This is particularly the case since a bus can not be allowed to carry more than 25-30 passengers in view of the social distancing norms.But in the face of a clamour from states to run special trains, the government is open to revisiting this condition. It hasn’t, however, taken a decision yet. One challenge would be to prevent people from pulling the chain between stations and getting off closer to their home.The idea of requiring people to travel in buses, a government official said, was to discourage people from travelling long distances.“The lockdown is going to be eased in a few days and the migrant workers should be able to get back to work in the green zones,” the official said.He explained that it would be unrealistic to expect economic activity to restart in the absence of the migrant workers who constitute. It was a point that had been underlined by Prime Minister Narendra Modi also when he had, during one of his many interactions with chief ministers, asked them to take care of the migrant workforce who may be natives of another state.There was, the official said, an added advantage of letting only migrants in relief camps returning home.“They have been living in the state’s relief camps and have been monitored by state health authorities…. Since there haven’t been any reports of an outbreak of the disease in the relief camps, it is reasonable to expect that workers, by and large, in these camps are free of infection and the chance of the disease spreading through them in the rural belt is minimal,” he explained.This is why the central government did not order the state governments to place the migrants in state quarantine facilities but allowed home quarantine. Besides, given the awareness of the disease in all parts of the country, it is reasonable to expect that there would be social pressure on the migrant returnees to stay in self-isolation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-centre-s-new-order-on-letting-migrants-travel-there-is-one-operative-word/story-e0WZuNMAJVqsGqVc25BWiN.html

01-05-2020||Editorials||The relaxations are positive. But the economy needs help||Never before in history, anywhere in the world, has a country of India’s population, size, and social and economic complexity shut down for 54 days. On Friday, the government extended the lockdown, which was supposed to end on May 3, for another two weeks, but with significant relaxations. This is more a graded exit plan spread over two weeks than a blanket extension of a hard lockdown. But it has been done without commensurate economic stimulus and a relief package, exposing a gap in India’s governance systems. This newspaper supported and called for a national lockdown in March. Given what was then known about the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), social distancing was the only way to slow down the rate of the spread of the infection. And while it is impossible to know the extent to which the disease would have spread in the absence of the national lockdown, it can be said with certainty that if more human-to-human interaction was allowed, India would be staring at far higher numbers today. This period has also been used to ramp up testing (though it needs to increase even more); create Covid-19 facilities; come to a consensus on an effective model to deal with the disease; and strengthen the health care infrastructure of the country. This model of “ruthless containment” relies on testing, isolation and quarantine. The calibrated exit is also welcome. It would have been impractical, even dangerous to have everything start up all at once. Even in the so-called red zones, enough activities have been allowed, albeit with an emphasis on safeguards. But what is perplexing is the delay in announcing an economic package. No country — even with the most resources — could have coped with a lockdown of this magnitude and the shocks to the supply chains and demand, and the impact on unemployment. India’s weak growth even before the lockdown started, and an inordinate, almost inexplicable, delay in announcing a comprehensive fiscal stimulus to support economic activity has been a glaring weakness — and the economic cost of this is being incurred everyday by a range of stakeholders. The government must address this immediately, as India prepares to slowly return to business.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-lockdown-helped-but-also-exposed-gaps-in-governance/story-QCiVVtFyMJVOx0qUONE4xI.html
