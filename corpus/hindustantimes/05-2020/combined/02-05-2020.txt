It spreads the message that we need to rethink how we treat all food animals, especially chickens, since poultry is the most consumed meat in the world.The rest of the world needs to join them in celebrating May 4 as International Chicken Day.Astonishingly, 60 billion chickens are reared for meat globally each year. India produces about three billion, in an industry valued at close to $20 billion. The broiler and layer industry that perfected itself in the US has spread globally, and so have all its practices, both good and bad. In India, it has created economies of scale, given livelihoods to thousands of farmers, and become an important source of protein.But animal rights activists have long tried to sensitise people that chickens are arguably the most abused animals on the planet. Broilers and layers undergo a lot of suffering so that humans can get low-cost protein. They also save other forms of wildlife from being trapped and slaughtered for food.From the moment they are born, these birds spend all their lives in total confinement. Broiler chickens are born in large incubators with hundreds of others; crammed into small, often filthy spaces. They are fed and drugged to become very large very quickly. They can become crippled under their own weight; they can get heart attacks and have organ failure. Many die because their baby-sized hearts cannot keep up with their adult-sized bodies. Sometimes, they, especially the layer hens, can’t even move; sometimes, their bodies grow outside and around their tightly packed wire cages. Broiler babies are slaughtered at around 42 days, though their natural lifespan can be 10-15 years. When they are ready to be killed, there is more agony waiting for them. They are roughly handled in small crates on the way to the slaughterhouse. Sometimes, they are immersed alive in hot water to remove their feathers. Sometimes, when there is no market for them, as during this pandemic, they are just buried alive in mass trenches. Yet, there is enough evidence to show that chickens are inquisitive, intelligent and highly social animals. Mother hens spend a lot of time teaching young ones and vocalising to them. Some studies have shown they could feel empathy and also jealousy. In experiments, they have shown they can count, and can even recognise human faces. Certainly, they feel fear and pain.Maybe it is time to rethink how chickens are bred, treated and eaten, too. There is a whole new generation of people who care about where their food comes from, and how it is grown. More people are turning vegetarian. There is also an increasing demand world over, and now in India, for humane meat, for free-range chickens and organic eggs. The recent pandemic has reminded us once again, this time with deadly urgency, about the threat of zoonotic disease that spread from the animal world to the human. People deserve to know more about the connection between the industrial processes at poultry farms and the spread of diseases. We now know exactly how much our well-being is intertwined with that of animals and birds. Maybe it is time to honour the sacrifice that they, and chickens especially, make for us all, including vegetarians. Let’s mark May 4 on our calendars, not just for the partial end of the lockdown, but for the end of misery for the animals we depend on for food.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/it-is-time-to-rethink-the-way-humans-treat-animals/story-x5g9ZztTIqbPk2racZSQ9M.html
02-05-2020||News||Economic activities must be restored. China’s model shows us the way||As the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) spread across the world, India decided to opt for a complete nationwide lockdown. It indeed helped control the infection, but has, predictably, invited great economic cost too. The crisis in China was equally monumental. Can it teach us how to tackle the crisis?China opted for a collaborative, data-based approach, with tech companies such as Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu, Huawei, and Meituan helping the government take timely action to prevent the spread of the virus and, at the same time, keep the economy running.But the equally important fact is that China didn’t opt for a nationwide lockdown as stringent as India did. It did completely lock Wuhan, the worst-affected city in the country, but it let the less-affected regions partially open. It allowed the availability of e-commerce for all items throughout. Ride-hailing services continued to operate. Grocery stores and restaurants, too, remained open throughout the lockdown, even though transactions mostly took place online.Tencent and Alibaba launched an app that alerted users if they were in the vicinity of an infected person. Alibaba Health launched a health care service with Tmall that delivered medicines to chronic patients within 30 minutes in 10 cities. It also collaborated with more than 50 top domestic and overseas pharmaceutical companies for the purpose. In merely a day, the number of chronic patients looking for medicines went up by 200%.Big brands could survive, but the long period of lockdown threatened the existence of small businesses. Hyper-local delivery services such as Meituan, Koubei and Ele.me (similar to Dunzo and Swiggy Go) leveraged their online platforms to link consumers with offline services and on-demand delivery. By the end of February, 50,000 offline shops had migrated online, partly because the platforms reduced or waived-off fees. By mid-March, between 500,000 and one million merchants benefited from the commission reduction/waiver scheme from Meituan, Koubei, and Ele.me.The Chinese government-endorsed digital migration and digital sales channels, which gave confidence to consumers and small and medium-sized enterprises to move online. As a result, categories such as health and wellness and digital accessories saw an upswing in sales during the lockdown. Home appliances such as rice cookers, sandwich makers, and juice makers saw a spike as more people cooked at home. Compared to their 2019 sales, Nike’s and Uniqlo’s sales went up by more than 25% between February 12 and March 12.The surge in online sales allowed many companies to create temporary employment schemes, absorbing self-employed daily wage earners affected due to the lockdown.But as new cases plateaued, companies resumed offline work gradually. Corporates, educational institutions, and other organisations were given customised mandates and processes on ways to minimise the risk as they opened up. Temperature checks and disinfectant stations were installed at all main entry-exit points in public places, offices, and mall entrances.Workplaces instituted daily online health check-ups for their employees even on weekends. People using public transportation for intercity travel were expected to quarantine for seven-14 days, depending on the severity of the infection in their city of origin. Employees commuting between cities for work were mandated to use private transportations only.Local services provided contactless meal delivery to employees and health care workers. Best practices around the resumption of work were communicated via live streaming, also leveraged by small offline stores to offset losses due to the shutdown. Flexible job openings helped small businesses resume work.By now, China may have seen its worst off. But India is yet to touch its peak. To minimise the economic disruption, it must find ways to strategically open up the economy in a way that doesn’t add up to infections. E-commerce, which the safest way to keep the economy running while ensuring social distancing, must be opened fully, in red, orange, and green zones. As of now, India allows only essential items over e-commerce platforms. But defining the essentiality of a commodity is a difficult exercise. Are online classes essential? Are the computers used to do so essentials? Is a malfunctioning phone charger essential, or are the prescription eyeglasses? The interconnectedness of the economy allows the sale of non-essential items produced by an economically weak person, with the profit nudging him to buy essentials, and thus, helping him contribute taxes.Like China, can the Indian government work with tech-based retail firms such as Flipkart, Amazon, Swiggy, Dunzo, PayTM to keep the economy running? Opening up the economy is a slow process – and, if not planned well, involves risks. Keeping the economic activities suppressed for long, however, can have far greater consequences.Divya Joseph is an MBA graduate of the China Europe International Business School (CEIBS) and works for Alibaba’s Tmall Global Operations Team in Hangzhou, China.

02-05-2020||Lucknow||Consider all options for resuming economic activity: Yogi to Team 11||A day after the Centre extended the lockdown for two weeks and issued new guidelines, chief minister Yogi Adityanath asked his team of officers to consider all options to restart economic activity in Uttar Pradesh after studying the central government’s norms.Yogi Adityanath was reviewing the lockdown situation at a meeting of his Team 11 on Saturday. Referring to the functioning of sugar mills and brick kilns during the lockdown, he said no case of coronavirus infection was reported from any of these units in the state. He also said distilleries attached to sugar mills produced sanitisers while sugar mills carried out sanitisation work during the period. Other industries should also be started on the same pattern, he suggested.Yogi said a work plan should be formulated to give a new dimensions to investment in the state. A work plan should also be prepared to provide 15-20 lakh jobs to people, the chief minister said to members of Team-11.He said migrant labourers/workers coming back to the state must be mandatorily quarantined. The process to bring back migrant labourers/workers should begin only after preparing a list and carrying out their health checkup.Those found unwell during a health examination should be given medical treatment, he said. He said an officer should be appointed to ensure that quarantine protocol was followed for migrant workers brought to the state.The state government had paid salaries to 16 lakh employees and 12 lakh retired employees well in time in spite of the Covid-19 pandemic, he said. The chief minister asked for measures to mobilise additional resources and he would hold a meeting with finance ministers again.Adityanath said the coronavirus infection chain would have to be broken to win the fight against Covid-19. Illegal intra-state and inter-state movement must be checked through effective policing, he said. OPDs should not be conducted in hospitals for now and a list of specialist doctors available for consultation through telemedicine should be published in newspapers, he said.Adityanath also said action should be taken to increase the number of beds in level one, two and three Covid-19 hospitals. Medical treatment of elders and children should be done only in level two and level three hospitals. Covid and non-Covid hospitals should be identified in every district, he said, adding that infrared thermometers should be made available in all the districts.The services of Pradeshik Raksha Dal (PRD) jawans should be taken to ensure order in the ‘mandis’. Besides, works under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana and Mukhya Mantri Awas Yojana should be started soon to provide MNREGA jobs to labourers, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/consider-all-options-for-resuming-economic-activity-yogi-to-team-11/story-2nFyxJP9rAFIGk52grg5dJ.html
02-05-2020||Lucknow||UP’s first Shramik Special train bringing back 847 migrants||Uttar Pradesh’s first ‘labour’ train, the Shramik Special, having 847 migrants onboard, will reach Charbagh railway station early morning on Sunday. The train that left Nasik at around 10:22am on Saturday, is perhaps the first train to operate during the lockdown announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 24 to contain the deadly corona virus outbreak.Both Northern Railways (NR) and District administration have made elaborate arrangements at the station to maintain social distancing among the labourers.The initiative is a part of the UP Government’s exercise to bring back migrants from different states. After being brought here, the migrants would be quarantined in their respective districts.Divisional railway manager (DRM) Lucknow division, NR Sanjay Tripathi said, “We will act in co-ordination with the UP government, district administration and Uttar Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (UPSRTC). We have also made arrangements at the station to strictly ensure social distancing.”NR officials who did not wish to be quoted, said the migrant labourers would be received at two points—portico one and portico two. “At both the places, we have painted blocks on the platform floors on which the labourers would be asked to stand to maintain social distancing. There would be thermal scanners at both the porticos where the migrants would be scanned,” the NR officer said.Once the migrant labours cross the thermal scanning where medical teams would be deployed, the district wise segregation would start where they would be asked to stand in groups (gap among the people in group would be one metre). “There would be only one exit gate open from where these migrants would be allowed to leave the station premises,” officer further said.Mukesh Meshram, divisional commissioner, Lucknow said the migrants alighting at the station would first undergo health check-up. “Those who are through would be segregated district wise. We have also arranged around 65 buses. The groups would be asked to board the buses leaving for their respective districts,” said Meshram. The commissioner further said that they had also informed the district magistrates of the districts to receive the migrants and to put them under quarantine for 14 days. He said that on their arrival at the station, it would be ensured that the food packets and a bag of essential goods was handed over to each and every migrant.7,500 MIGRANTS REACHED UP TODAYOn Saturday, around 7500 migrants who were stranded in Rajasthan and Uttarakahand arrived in the state capital. Raj Shekhar, managing director (MD) said the two states transported the migrants to the borders of UP from where around 285 buses would be deployed to transport the migrants to their respective home districts. Besides, UPSRTC also deployed 35 special buses to bring back around 1000 migrant labourers from UP who were stranded in Haridwar district of Uttarakhand. “Those who returned from Rajasthan were dropped in Mathura district where we made arrangements to ferry them. And those returning from Uttarakhand were dropped in Bareilly district where we have deployed a fleet of 60 buses,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-s-first-shramik-special-train-bringing-back-847-migrants/story-iIQ25aNexaJJCxN9NnIGHL.html
02-05-2020||Chandigarh||Kesar Ganj Mandi traders go on two-day strike over ‘police harassment’||The traders at the Kesar Ganj Mandi, a wholesale groceries market, went on a two-day strike on Saturday, alleging police harassment with them. “The cops deputed here on the lockdown duty have been troubling traders every now and then. They make the traders park their vehicles at least 400 metres away from their shops and don’t allow them to open shutter while unloading the material from their vehicles,” members of the market association said, adding that the police personnel also threaten them with sealing their shops.“Therefore, to show our resentment, all associations of the Kesar Ganj Mandi have decided to keep the shops shut on Saturday and Sunday,” they added.Rice Traders’ Association president Subhash Bansal said earlier, due to the lockdown they were not operating. Later, the officials of the food and supply department called them for a meeting and requested to resume work so that the supply of essential commodities does not get affected in the city. The police and district administration had also promised full cooperation to them. However, now the police personnel deployed here are not cooperating with us, Bansal said.“If we have to make home deliveries, we are supposed to pick heavy cartons, walk for 400 metres to reach our vehicles. While unloading the groceries from delivery vehicles, we have to open the shutter, but police don’t allow us to open the shutters. If police, doctors and sanitary workers are getting appreciation for working amid Covid-19 fear, we too are doing the same. But we are being harassed,” he said.President of the Dal Trade Association Pritpal Singh alleged that the police were biased towards some traders, who they allowed to open shutters while unloading the material. “Before the lockdown, we had lodged a compliant against a station house officer (SHO) over his misbehaviour with the traders and now he is harassing us,” Singh said. Meanwhile, commissioner of police (CP) Rakesh Agarwal said he was not aware about strike called by the traders. “I will ask the associations to discuss their grievances and we will resolve them soon,” the CP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/kesar-ganj-mandi-traders-go-on-two-day-strike-over-police-harassment/story-YxHeTlYf9XxeNEsRxjpLMK.html

02-05-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19: City crosses 8-K mark; 137 discharged on Saturday||A growing hotspot for Covid-19 cases in one of the country’s largest and congested slums, Dharavi, recorded 89 cases on Saturday and a total of 221 cases in the past six days, bringing the tally on Saturday to 496. The area recorded the highest number of cases on Saturday. Overall, Mumbai recorded 547 cases of Covid-19, crossing the 8,000-mark, and 27 deaths were reported on Saturday. The total number of cases in the city has reached 8,172 and there have been 322 deaths so far. Of these, 1,704 people have recovered and were discharged. On Saturday alone, 137 recovered patients were discharged from hospitals across the city.The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation attributed the rise in positive cases in Dharavi to aggressive contact tracing and pro-active screening through slum surveys of senior citizens, fever clinics, health camps, and municipal dispensaries.According to civic officials of the G North ward (Dharavi, Dadar, Mahim), around 79, 000 people have been screened in Dharavi, of which, 25,000 were screened this week alone. Nearly 1, 920 were suspected to be positive and have been referred to institutional quarantines where they are tested for Covid-19. Mahim area also recorded 15 new positive cases on Saturday, taking the total number of cases there to 52. Dadar recorded 13 new cases, bringing the total to 46 till Saturday.Meanwhile, data released by the BMC states that more than 1.20 lakh people across Mumbai had been home quarantined by the civic body till April 30, of which 35, 380 have completed their quarantine. The BMC also claims to have tracked 1. 57 lakh people through contact tracing; 26, 584 of them are high-risk contacts. While people are home quarantined, some are also being quarantined in realty projects that are constructed but not yet sold. One of those is a Mhada building in Borivli where residents of some slum pockets were quarantined earlier this week. On Saturday, there was a ruckus at Sector 9 of a Charkop Mhada building after the slum dwellers who were shifted there had a quarrel with BMC officials over poor living conditions, including low-quality food, lack of hot water for those with throat ailments, etc. Mandar Musle, one of the people quarantined, said, “We cannot eat the stale food served to us. The building has one lift which they used to ferry a positive patient and the same lift is used to deliver the food. There are no proper arrangements at all.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-city-crosses-8-k-mark-137-discharged-on-saturday/story-wHaVd6aBNKMq4FYmpS0ctJ.html
02-05-2020||Mumbai||Residents’ association starts e-library for locals across age groups||For the past few days, around 400 people from Tilak Nagar in Chembur have been able to access various newspapers and e-books on social networking platforms thanks to a new digital library that was set up for residents.The office-bearers of the Tilak Nagar Residents Welfare Association (TNRWA) had earlier intended to hold an entrepreneurship workshop for youngsters in April and May. However, after the lockdown began, they decided to switch to online platforms to keep their residents occupied with access to various e-books and periodicals.“It started with a WhatsApp group on which we were sending links to newspapers and magazines, but then parents started requesting us to start a platform where we could keep their children occupied as well, which is how a parenting group started on WhatsApp and Telegram,” said Tony Jose, business coach and a resident.Jose said that while the group was first started for members of the resident association, it is now open to people from across the world.Currently, Jose runs three reading groups – one for people of all ages; a second for children and parents, and the third one for college students.Across these platforms, newspapers of different languages, along with educational, informative, self-help and fiction books are shared for people of all age groups.On the parenting group, the association shares readings and comics for children from Amar Chitra Katha, Tinkle, and superhero comics. It also provides access to parenting development. For youngsters, life skills, leadership, and entrepreneurship books are shared.“We regularly have a Zoom call session with these youngsters who have enrolled for entrepreneurship-related updates, wherein we speak to them about their takeaways from these books,” said Jose.“During the lockdown, as a working mother, it has been a challenge to keep my hyperactive son engaged. Access to this literature has helped me not only to keep my son engaged through learning but has also helped my senior parents to utilise this lockdown time creatively and build on their information. The best part is that it has helped us develop as a community through sharing,” said Harshika Khona, an entrepreneur and resident of Tilak Nagar.“Earlier, my eight-year-old son was busy with school, tuitions, and extra-curricular activities. During this lockdown, we have a lot of time, apart from his online school lectures. We decided to improve his reading skills through the e-library. It has helped improve his imagination as well,” said Kaning Thakker, resident of the area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/residents-association-starts-e-library-for-locals-across-age-groups/story-sJKgrockAbzfa1J1hSY0DJ.html

He was produced before the Dahanu court and has been remanded in police custody till 14 May. The arrested accused in the case have been lodged in different police stations in a bid to avoid overcrowding amid lockdown.Following due procedure, the accused were first tested for Covid-19 on April 28 morning, wherein the accused had tested negative. However, his second test report on Saturday was positive, said Dr Gavit. He has since been transferred to the prison ward of JJ Hospital, Mumbai, said Dr Gavit. He further added that the accused was asymptomatic and that the authorities have taken swab samples of 43 others, including 20 accused and 23 police personnel, who were at the police station.Palghar has so far reported 170 positive cases with 10 deaths including areas under Vasai-Virar Municipal Corporation, while 59 have been discharged after recovery. Till now, 2,691 people have tested negative and reports of 188 is awaited, said an official from the District Information Office (DIO), Palghar.Meanwhile, around 60 police officers from across Palghar district have been posted to nab around 200 accused who are hiding in the jungles bordering the Union Territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli, which is just 500 metre away from Gaddchinchale village where the lynching took place, said an officer from Kasa police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/palghar-lynching-case-accused-tests-positive-swab-samples-of-43-others-sent-for-testing/story-0qVNBs4tf7vYYemdkX1TtN.html
02-05-2020||Mumbai||Need to revive all sectors together, experts tell CM Uddhav Thackeray||To help tackle the economic impact of the lockdown imposed to contain the spread of Covid-19, a team of 14 from University of Mumbai’s Mumbai School of Economics and Public Policy has drawn up a report with recommendations for the state, highlighting the need for multi-faceted change in multiple sectors.The report, submitted on April 30 to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and the state finance department, was drawn up by 14 members of the school’s economics department, including professors, junior fellows and research staff. “The situation at hand is such that the government cannot focus on only one or two sectors. Revival of all sectors together is needed,” said one of the 14 members.Need for multi-faceted change in fiscal and financial policies, consumption and investment policies as well as micro-level service and agricultural sectors along with transport, education and health industries is highlighted in the report. “Decentralisation would be the key to how well policies get implemented and that would determine how soon we can get our economy to re-bound,”said Mala Lalwani, head of Mumbai School of Economics. The lockdown, which has been extended till May 17, has hit several service sectors including hospitality, tourism and real estate. The recommendations include constant help from the government for a few months to a year and better support for farmers. For rural areas, the report suggests more supplementary nutrition programs as well as a push for digitisation of the education system. “This lockdown has provided a political opportunity to push through important reforms as Covid-19 has laid bare several lacunae in different sectors. Areas like urban governance and public health management need to witness maximum changes,” said a professor from the department.The report also shows how raising significant funds is important but equally important would be effective utilisation of resources for maximum impact. From earmarking windfall gains in revenues — like those from the fall in international oil prices — and diverting these to public health; to the need for banks to ensure sufficient credit availability to different sectors and reduce risk aversion, the recommendations cover reviving of investment policies as well.The team of 14 worked on the report for three weeks during the lockdown.  “The University of Mumbai’s vice chancellor suggested we work together on this front and this has to be the first time that we worked together but from our own homes to put together the suggestions,” said a team member.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/need-to-revive-all-sectors-together-experts-tell-cm-uddhav-thackeray/story-AHAeFXM0L8QV2RrmpIkEGI.html
02-05-2020||Mumbai||Researchers from three institutes develop algorithm for better contact-tracing||Researchers from three premier scientific institutes in India have developed an algorithm for ‘improved’ Covid-19 contact-tracing via mobile phones that can identify indirect contacts who may be at risk of contracting the virus.Currently digital contract-tracing algorithms – including the government’s Aarogya Setu Covid-19 app – are undocumented but seem to be largely restricted to identifying and following-up on individuals who may have come in direct contact with a Covid-19 positive person.The newly created algorithm can identify individuals who are at risk of contracting the disease from high-risk contacts of a Covid positive person who are not themselves known to be infected, said researchers at the Bengaluru-based Indian Institute of Science (IISc) and National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS), and Institute of Mathematical Sciences (IMSc) at Chennai.“For example, if you met A, and I later met you, and A is found to be infected, not just you but I too could be at risk. Our methodology calculates this probabilistically,” said Rahul Siddharthan, professor of computational biology at IMSc. “In our simulations, we found our method to be more effective than direct contact tracing methods; that is, for a given ‘false positive rate’ (fraction of negative cases that we wrongly call positive), we get a higher ‘true positive rate’ (fraction of positive cases that we correctly call positive).” On Friday, their paper ‘Risk assessment via layered mobile contact tracing for epidemiological intervention’ was uploaded on medRxiv, the preprint server for health sciences operated by US-based Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.With concerns about surveillance and privacy surrounding Aarogya Setu and similar apps, the new algorithm stores most data locally on the individual’s phone and requires minimal communication with a server; thus it can be secured to ensure privacy. For instance, only when a person is tested and found to be infected, his/her contact traces need to be informed/identified, possibly via a centralised system. The algorithm maintains privacy in terms of contact history and location history, and shares only the risk factor to the government. “Current apps are opaque on what exactly they do with the collected data and how they process it,” said Vishwesha Guttal, associate professor at IISc. “By making our algorithm public, we bring the issues of privacy concerns to the forefront. For apps that do not publish the algorithm, there is no way to know how they process the data, and therefore, serious concerns of privacy will exist.” “Current apps do not present their methodology of how they assess risk of an individual having contracted the disease,” said professor Sandeep Krishna, member of the Simons Centre for the Study of Living Machines, NCBS. “We hope that our work will encourage app developers (including that of Aarogya Setu) to make their algorithm public. One can then compare all the algorithms and adopt the one that’s most efficient.”The three-member team has shared their work with K VijayRaghavan, principal scientific advisor to the government of India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/researchers-from-three-institutes-develop-algorithm-for-better-contact-tracing/story-u3vQysCNJ6KDBNypQYDLSO.html
02-05-2020||City||Maharashtra: 56 Covid-19 patients discharged at a time from hospital||As many as 56 Covid-19 patients, including a three-year-old girl, were discharged at the same time from a civic-run hospital in Mira Bhayandar township in Thane district of Maharashtra after recovery, an official said.The staff at the hospital, including the doctors, clapped for them and bid them goodbye.“As per the latest report, a total of 161 persons have tested coronavirus positive in the township. Of them 41 were discharged till a couple of days back. On Saturday, 56 others discharged at one time after their repeat samples tested negative,” the official said.In-charge officer, Dr B D Arsulkar, said of the 56 patients discharged on Saturday, the youngest one was a three-year-old girl, while three persons were over 70 years of age.“Sixty others are undergoing treatment. Three patients have died due to the infection in the township,” he said.Talking to reporters, Municipal Commissioner of Mira Bhayandar, Chandrakant Dange said, “The administration could control the spread of the virus due to the complete lockdown in place in the township since the last past 12 days. Only medical shops are open and milk is being supplied.” MLA Geeta Jain said it was perhaps the first time in the state that so many Covid-19 patients were discharged at once.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/maharashtra-56-covid-19-patients-discharged-at-a-time-from-hospital/story-iieq0EN4ljkiZ6pdSyEAjL.html
02-05-2020||Chandigarh||200 inmates of Ludhiana Women’s Jail shifted to Pathankot jail||As many as 200 inmates of the Ludhiana Women’s Jail were shifted to the women’s jail in Pathankot on Saturday, after an inmate tested positive for Covid-19 on Friday. Confirming the development, Ludhiana Women’s Jail superintendent said, “For the safety of the inmates and to maintain social distancing among them, we have shifted the inmates to Pathankot jail. Now, we have 45 inmates here.”Meanwhile, 15 inmates and five jail employees, who came in contact with the positive patient, were quarantined.The 48-year-old undertrial, who was arrested under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, was brought to the jail by the Sangrur police on Thursday. The woman’s samples were taken for testing on Friday after she exhibited symptoms of coronavirus. She tested positive for Covid-19 on Friday night and is undergoing treatment at the civil hospital in Ludhiana.Earlier on April 19, as many as 200 inmates lodged in Borstal jail were shifted to Faridkot jail due to coronavirus fear. The step was taken to accommodate inmates of Ludhiana Central Jail, which was already overcrowded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/200-inmates-of-ludhiana-women-s-jail-shifted-to-pathankot-jail/story-6FpdPUfkeLWAQ2kSEA6euI.html
02-05-2020||Chandigarh||Knitters’ body submits MSME revival plan with PM Modi||With the industry reeling under losses due to the Covid-19 lockdown, the Ludhiana Knitters’ Association on Saturday sent a plan to revive the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) sector to the Prime Minister’s (PM) Office on Saturday. In a letter sent to the PMO, the association has demanded relief for the industry in terms of bank interest waiver, payment of salaries/wages to workers by the government, ban on duty-free imports from Bangladesh, etc.President of the association Ajit Lakra said, “The steps being taken by the government to contain Covid-19 are need of the hour, but these are also causing damage to the economy and the industry and a special plan to revive them is also needed.”He said the Union government needed to take a decision to cash in on the situation when the US-China relations were at the historic low and several nations were deciding to boycott China.Some of the major reliefs demanded by the association include bank interest waiver for six months, deferment of term loan EMIs for a minimum of one year without downgrading the credit rating of units to avoid NPAs, lowering interest rates of MSME industry loans by a minimum of 3 basis points and waiving of ESI and PF contribution by employers and employees for three months.The association has also demanded that the government should pay or contribute in the salaries/wages to be paid for the lockdown period and for this funds lying under ESI and PF heads can be used. To ease liquidity of the units, the association has suggested that 75% of the goods and services tax (GST) credit of the units should be refunded.The association has also suggested that policies should be amended to attract the companies exiting China and make India a preferred destination for foreign investment. The association has also sought a ban on duty-free import of man-made fibre (MMF) garments from Bangladesh and increase in duties on all imports from China to promote the Indian industry for substituting imports.The insurance premiums of the industry are very high and beyond the reach of MSMEs, so rates should be reduced and premium of all categories of insurance for the lockdown period be waived or period of renewals be extended accordingly, the association said.‘GOVT SHOULD UTILISE WEALTH OF TEMPLES TO GENERATE FUNDS’The association said, “The government can utilise 90% wealth of temples and other religious places for generating funds to compensate banks and insurance companies to provide the sought reliefs. By doing so, the government can generate up to Rs 20 lakh crore. The government should also bring back about US $179 billion kept in US bonds with a return of not more than 1% per annum.” Unless the above reliefs are announced immediately, there will be massive unemployment and the economy will not be able to bounce back, said the association chief.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/knitters-body-submits-msme-revival-plan-with-pm-modi/story-sU2yBQ2B4QphD8VmJ1Iy0J.html

02-05-2020||Chandigarh||For a newspaper addict, going digital is not great||The newspaper has always been a part of my routine. I remember, even as a child, watching my father pacing up and down as he waited anxiously for it in the morning. Like a guided missile, the rolled up newspaper used to land in our balcony with a thud. The day the target was missed, the army, comprising my younger brother, sister and I, was deployed for search operations.Father initiated us into reading newspapers at an early age; slowly it became a habit and then turned into an addiction. Unlike the techno-savvy generation of today that prefers to checks the news on mobile phones, I don’t enjoy checking out Google for my dose of news as I miss the insightful editorials, the crisp middles and many other features in a newspaper. For a technically challenged person like me, reading news digitally is a hassle; and I’m not comfortable with an e-paper. Besides, flipping the pages has a joy of its own that cannot be felt digitally.In the age of ‘infodemics’ when there is explosion of information without verification in social media, I bank upon traditional media. My inbox may be flooded with all sorts of forwarded messages, but I tend to rely upon print media which I expect to be more responsible and reliable.The coronavirus onslaught and the resultant lockdown has turned life topsy-turvy. The supply of essentials got disrupted initially, but was restored within a couple of days. However, as the newspaper was not delivered for quite some time, my husband and I, holed up at home, started missing it badly. Our mornings were not the same and the morning cup of tea had lost its charm.After a week or so, however, I was in for a pleasant surprise. My eyes lit up to see a bundle of newspapers lying in the verandah. Excitedly, I rushed out to grab them, but hesitated for a moment as all those apprehensions of catching an infection crowded my mind.Then, I got an idea. Picking up the newspapers I marched towards the ironing table, ironed the outer exposed pages with a hot iron and washed my hands thoroughly (full 20 seconds with soap and water). Newspaper and hands sanitised, with much glee, I sat down to enjoy the morning, a steaming cup of tea and my crisp copy in hand!Not that there is much to cheer about these days, as coronavirus is everywhere. However, with the newspaper back in the morning, a semblance of normalcy has been restored in our lives.rama_1177@yahoo.co.in(The writer is a retired associate professor of MCMDAV College, Chandigarh)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/for-a-newspaper-addict-going-digital-is-not-great/story-g7tjMySPxnFSjRIXV4knnN.html
02-05-2020||City||Wildbuzz: Caught between a cobra & corona||The Chandigarh forest and wildlife department rescue team faces a ticklish situation. The team is receiving distress calls from residents, who have spotted a serpent in their homes. These are predominantly Spectacled cobras, while other species include Rat snakes, vipers and Checkered keelbacks. However, some residents are in dilemma. They are apprehensive that a team comprising two or three snake wranglers may import the dreaded Coronavirus when they come in to search their homes for the fugitive serpent. Wearing masks and observing Covid-19 protocols, the team members do present a surreal spectacle. They have to patiently explain to residents that risks of transmitting the virus are non-existent as they are free of the contagious disease. But the depth of Corona paranoia, which has wormed its way deep into the minds of residents, cannot be underestimated. It is akin to a terror of invisible ghosts. Serpents hiding in a house similarly invoke a fear of unseen ghosts that can lurk and lunge from any dark crevice. “Such residents ultimately resolve their dilemmas and let us search the premises as they cannot bear the presence of the serpent. Due to undisturbed conditions and reduced presence of humans, snakes are moving around and crossing deserted streets and lanes more frequently. The undisturbed conditions lull them into venturing into homes and bedraggled gardens,” a team member told this writer.Salim Khan, the tricity’s veteran snake-rescue personnel, too, has his hands full with unprecedented complications. The most interesting case was of a man who found a snake in his stationary car’s engine. The man had no permission to drive the car but he was able to clear the ‘nakas’ by warning cops that a serpent was hiding right under the bonnet and that he was desperate to reach Khan for its removal. Cops duly accorded the speediest clearance!EVERY DAY IS A MONDAYChandigarh Golf Club president Sandeep S Sandhu remarks in jest that “every day is a Monday for wildlife at our club!” Mondays were days in the BC (Before Covid) era when the club was shut down for maintenance and animals and peacocks would wander lazily on fairways. Going a step further, the club’s assistant course manager Surjit Singh describes the animal invasion during the Covid-19 curfew as one where “creatures have gained azaadi (freedom) and the lush greens, groves and fairways are serving as an extension of the jungles.”The highlight was a majestic Neelgai bull strolling along and up the fairway of the 18th hole towards the locked club house. The undisturbed bull’s pace was remindful of slow golfers who couldn’t care less for players behind them and long awaiting their turn at the shot with peevish patience and fraying tempers! On some days during the curfew, 40-50 Neelgais come and sit around the 12-13th hole complex and nibble at the soft grass, which, for them, is a welcome change from the adjoining jungle’s hardy, stale and thorn-protected flora. “We had an unusual intruder, a wild boar, who started digging the area next to the 13th hole green for roots and tubers. I asked my staff to spread naphthalene balls to drive away the boar as it reacts adversely to such odours. That ruse worked well,” Sandhu told this writer.The scourge of boars ripping greens is manifest at the Army’s Shivalik Golf Club (SEPTA), Chandimandir. After having tried all methods, and on the then Western Army commander’s advice, the SEPTA management had once ordered jawans to store their urine in plastic bottles. The bottles were strung on green fringes. For some time, marauding boars coming in at night smelt the urine, suspected human presence and beat an inglorious retreat. But pugnacious creatures as they are, the boars soon smelt a proverbial rat and the urine ruse did not work after that.vjswild1@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/wildbuzz-caught-between-a-cobra-corona/story-oDoCcssz3iGt6XDOG0XFRP.html

The industry should work more professionally and a result-oriented approach should be adopted,” said Ahuja.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/cicu-members-discuss-post-lockdown-challenges-with-indian-ambassador-to-japan/story-wnZiNQJHDxb5A0A7ia2g7N.html
02-05-2020||Lucknow||Despite ban, gutkha, pan masala available in Agra||People in Agra can still manage to buy ‘gutkha’ and ‘pan’ parag from black marketers by paying exorbitant prices for them despite a ban on sale of these tobacco products.The price of gutkha has increased more than four to five times but it is not deterring people from purchasing them.People could be found hanging around shops without worrying about lock down violation.According to sources, the price of Rs 5 gutkha has increased up to Rs 25-30. Besides, the price of branded pan masala is available at the price of Rs 150-200 with the black marketers. It can be bought from most of the localities of city, added source. An attendant of the kin at SN Medical College (SNMC) said, “I buy gutkha from the road side tea shop near emergency ward of SNMC. But the shopkeeper is charging too high price according to his wish.”However, he avoids selling to strangers, but once you start visiting everyday at his tea shop and buy tea he can give you, informed the attendant. An addicted resident revealed, “Earlier, I used to eat 15 sachets of gutkha, but now it has reduced to 5-6 in day. I have to put many efforts to get it. But some day, I am not able to eat any due to unavailability of it.”“Not only rates of gutkha and pan masala have increased these days, but price of ‘bidi’ and cigarette have also increased too much,” he added When contacted ADM City Dr Prabhakant Awasthi, he said, “We have been taking action against those who are selling tobacco and pan masala illegally. The concerned nodal officer is keeping a strict vigil in this regard.”Furthermore, designated officer of Food Safety and Drug Administration (FSDA), Agra Manoj Verma said, “We have confiscated two sacks of ‘supari’ at the end of April month. We acted against the owner as per norms of FSDA act.”“We have been regularly carrying out inspection and acts accordingly against those who try to sell ‘gutkha’ and pan masala,” he informed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/despite-ban-gutkha-pan-masala-available-in-agra/story-ArTUFLiE6xPOSHnWpqPIVP.html

02-05-2020||Gurugram||With Delhi-Gurugram border sealed, people forced to travel on foot||Many commuters were seen crossing the Delhi-Gurugram border with luggage on Saturday. Following the orders issued by the district administration on Friday, the border was sealed and people were asked to return to the respective cities they work in. All the old permissions for movement were canceled and the employees working in Gurugram were asked to make arrangements in the city.Karan Goel, the assistant commissioner of police, ACP (DLF), said that residents of the two cities, who have been travelling across the borders daily for work, had started shifting their base. “We allowed people who were carrying their luggage and carried valid permission from their offices to shift their base. Many companies have already made arrangements of the lodging for their staff members,” he said.The scene at the border was chaotic as people were seen trying to cross the barricades holding their bags and suitcases. People from Gurugram called vehicles at the Sirhaul border, walked on the wrong side from Ambience Mall, and boarded their cars, after crossing the border.Ankit Hooda, a resident of Sector 56, Gurugram, who crossed the border on Saturday morning, said that his office is in ITO and all of his colleagues who are working have shifted closer to the office. “The new order states that we will not be allowed to cross the border every day and will have to stay near our workplaces. The office has asked us to shift with our colleagues or relatives living in the national Capital. We had requested our friends to reach the border to pick us up, and we crossed walking,” he said.Another employee, Ruchika Das of a private laboratory, who works in Gurugram, was seen shifting her base temporarily. She said it was a sudden decision taken by the company and she had to shift within an hour. “I have packed stuff for two weeks as the lockdown is extended until May 17. Our working hours have also been extended as only a few employees are allowed to work. Staying in temporary accommodation for long is very uncomfortable and you cannot rely on food provided by the company which will be delivering it from an outsourced agency,” she said. Many people have also given an undertaking to police that they will not return to the city unless the lockdown is uplifted, said the police, adding that they has taken down the details of the employees who were shifting their base to their respective work cities, by asking them to submit an undertaking from them. The police also said they are maintaining a record to ensure that no one misuses the relaxation permission. All violators will be booked under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code(IPC).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/with-delhi-gurugram-border-sealed-people-forced-to-travel-on-foot/story-2cKuDP4djzxTBeVN4zy6DO.html
02-05-2020||Gurugram||High freight cost, few transport options make exports difficult||The steep increase in freight charges for air cargo and few trucks is proving to be a major stumbling block for exporters in the Gurugram-Manesar industrial belt. There are over 500 small and large garment export units in Udyog Vihar and Manesar, which supply to markets in Italy, France, Spain and other European countries. Their goods, worth around ₹500 crore, are now stuck at their warehouses for months since the coronavirus outbreak hit Europe bring the region’s economies to a virtual standstill. With India enforcing the ongoing country-wide lockdown to contain the disease on March 25 , their troubles just got harder.The exporters say that airfreight charges, which was once between ₹100 to ₹120 per kilogram earlier has shot up to ₹500 to ₹600 a kilogram. These firms are not being able to send their goods to warehouses of large transport companies located on the outskirts of the city either for further shipment to ports like Mumbai.“We send the finished goods by air or by sea but this has now become too expensive. The local trucks are not available and we can’t use our own vehicles to transport goods to warehouses locally,” said Satyendra Singh, general manager of an Udyog Vihar based export firm.Whatever few truck companies are there, they too are charging higher rates, he added. Also bothering them are the multiple permissions required to resume operations, and meeting the conditions of the standard operating procedures during the lockdown.On Friday, while extending the lockdown for another two weeks, the Union ministry of home affairs guidelines had made it clear that movement of any cargo trucks was allowed without any conditions. These will be in effect from May 4, but transporters fear that these instructions may not trickle down to the ground inspectors.“There is express need for authorities to ensure that goods vehicle are not stopped due to Covid-19. Due to multiple checks, the transporters are also not comfortable in taking loads. Also there is a major shortage of drivers,” said Manomohan Gaind, a Manesar-based exporter.The industrial associations in the city also want that restrictions should be eased and permission be give to transport and other firms to operate on priority. “There should be a single authority in the district to clear such matters so that there is no confusion,” said JN Mangla, president, Gurgaon Industrial Association.Naveen Gupta, general secretary, All India Motor Transport Congress, said, “In many parts of the country trucks are being stopped for no reason and challans are being issued. Support staff like conductors, and helpers are not able to move around and the drivers are also not being able to come, which has complicated the problems.”Further, the truckers said that there was uncertainty over opening of godowns, offices, booking offices, and movement of support staff was problematic due to different categorization of zones.A Haryana government spokesperson, however, said that they are giving preference in issuance of passes and other necessary support to 100% export oriented units and those which have labour on site.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/high-freight-cost-few-transport-options-make-exports-difficult/story-Cg7jPqB2g3yIU6GzFHLqdP.html
02-05-2020||Gurugram||State govt offers to bear six months’ interest on loans for industries||The Haryana government launched an interest subsidy scheme on Thursday for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) reeling under financial stress during the lockdown period. Several industries had demanded a financial package from the state and central governments to pay salaries to their workers. The notification was issued after a cabinet meeting on Thursday evening said all the MSME units working in Haryana, as on March 15, 2020, will be eligible to 100 percent interest benefit on loans availed for payment of the wages of employees and/or other expenses up to a maximum of ₹20,000 per employee.“The interest benefit shall be limited to the interest paid by the MSME unit to the bank up to a period of six months starting from March 15. The interest benefit shall be calculated at a rate of interest of maximum eight percent/year or actual rate of interest charged by the bank or whichever is lower,” said the notification.The notification also said that once salaries for the month of April are paid to the workers, industries can apply to avail interest benefits on the industries and commerce department’s portal with all relevant documents.“The interest subsidy scheme for the MSME has been approved by the Haryana government/cabinet and we believe it will act a catalyst in the revival of the industries in the state which are shutdown due to the outbreak of Covid-19 ,” said TVSN Prasad, additional chief secretary industries and commerce department, Haryana. Prasad, who prepared the draft of the interest scheme, added the Haryana government will refund the interest claimed by owners directly in their bank accounts.Additional chief secretary Prasad said those industry owners who have not currently availed such loans can apply for a fresh loan to avail the interest subsidy being offered by the state government.Most industries in the state have been shut since March 21, and a few of them were allowed to start operations after April 20 after taking permission from the administration. Industry owners in Gurugram, which is an MSME hub, said with zero production their financial liabilities were mounting as the had to repay their loans, pay workers’ salaries, goods and service taxes, electricity bills, rent etc. The fear of shutting down permanently also looms large over small industries that are under debt.Following directions of the union ministry of home affairs (MHA), industry owners need to continue paying salaries to workers during the lockdown period. As the nationwide lockdown enters its third phase, many industries have been demanding financial relief.The subsidy scheme, launched in light of such demands, has however come under criticism from several industry owners. They said that the procedure to avail the benefits is cumbersome and added that the capping of the scheme benefits at ₹20, 000 per employee and at 8 percent interest rate will not be extremely helpful to them. Sanjiv Bansal, Kadipur-based industry owner, said, “Government should give us instant relief – we have to pay salaries to workers within a day or so. We do not want to apply for a bank loan and then avail the interest benefits later.”Raj Singla, Udyog Vihar-based industry owner, said, “The interest benefit at of 8% interest and capping the benefits at ₹20,000 per employee seems insignificant, besides the apprehension of procedure being cumbersome and not hassle-free.”Many small scale industries are not even confident of starting operations and do not want to bear the burden of a loan to avail interest benefits.Aseem Takyar, an industry owner in Udyog Vihar, said, “The Haryana government should have rather announced relaxation in goods and service tax (GST) by instantly reducing its rate from 12 percent to six percent. We do not want to avail this subsidy scheme.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/state-govt-offers-to-bear-six-months-interest-on-loans-for-industries/story-IP53JraM6IaQk0PBhH4eAO.html

With the addition of new cases, the total number of Covid-19 cases in Gurugram has reached 67, of which 29 are active cases.“Of the four cases, two are linked with the Dundahera family where three people were confirmed Covid-19 positive on Friday. Another case is of a New Palam Vihar resident, who worked at a private hospital in Delhi, came in contact with a colleague at the cash counter of the hospital who had tested positive. Also, a man from Rajeev Nagar, who has a jewellery store in Delhi, is confirmed Covid-19 positive after he visited the neighbouring city,” said Dr Jaswant Singh Punia, chief medical officer.On Friday, three people from Dundahera tested positive after they came in contact with a man from the area who had visited Delhi’s Ram Manohar Lohia hospital for the treatment of his epileptic son. The man visited Dundahera for a day on April 22 and was confirmed Covid-19 positive on April 25. “Till now, five people in Dundahera have tested Covid-19 positive after coming in contact with the man,” said Punia. A member of the rapid response team said that the health department will ask district administration to declare Dundahera a containment zone after the spike in the number of cases. Also, the area is in proximity to Delhi’s Kapashera where 41 people were tested positive on Saturday. Currently, there are 24 containment zones in Gurugram. To keep a check on the containment zones, the health team collected more than 100 samples and conducted 93 antibody tests using rapid testing kits in Jharsa and Sector 39.In neighbouring Faridabad district, two new positive cases emerged on Saturday. Yashpal Yadav, Faridabad deputy commissioner, said, “One is the grandson of the 68-year-old man who had died due to Coronavirus earlier this week, and the other is a 25-year-old woman who resides near Bata Chowk. We are investigating how the woman contracted the infection.” Faridabad has reported a total of 61 positive cases so far, of which 42 have been discharged from different hospitals after being cured.

02-05-2020||Delhi||Vishal Yadav’s parole plea to be considered||The Delhi High Court has directed the competent authority to decide on the parole plea of Vishal Yadav, convicted for the murder of business executive Nitish Katara in 2002. Yadav is serving a life imprisonment sentence and is currently lodged in Tihar Jail. Delhi’s lieutenant governor (L-G) Anil Baijal has the power to grant parole to prisoners. The L-G may authorise any officer from the state government’s home department to decide on granting or refusing parole. Justice AK Chawla said that Yadav’s plea seeking eight-week parole is to be treated as a representation and be disposed of within 15 days. Yadav, through his counsel Sanyam Khetarpal, had moved the court stating that he is at an increased risk of contracting the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) since he has a history of tuberculosis.“In the considered view of the court, the subject matter requires to be considered by the competent authority in the first instance,” Justice AK Chawla said.On Friday, the counsel for the Delhi government, additional standing counsel (criminal) Rajesh Mahajan, told the court that the representation would be considered on its merits and will be disposed of within three weeks.Yadav, along with his brother Vikas Yadav and another person, were found guilty of murdering Katara, a businessman, as they did not approve of his relationship with their sister. A Delhi court had convicted the trio in May 2008 and the sentence of life imprisonment was upheld by the Delhi High Court in 2014.The Tihar prison, which has around 18,000 inmates, is the most crowded prison complex across the country. As on Saturday afternoon, the prison had not reported a single case of Covid-19. As a measure to contain the spread of Covid-19 by decongesting the prison, around 3,000 prisoners were released last month. The prisoners lodged in open jail have also been told to avail the eight-week parole. Until the lockdown started, open jail prisoners would leave the prison complex in the morning to work outside and return in the evening. The jail administration has also cancelled the visits of all family members. Before this, every prisoner was entitled to meet his/her family member twice a week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/vishal-yadav-s-parole-plea-to-be-considered/story-Q9uR69c3XpBXLZ3zdXiwiO.html
02-05-2020||Gurugram||Use LPG furnace to cremate Covid victims, orders CM||To contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, on Saturday, directed the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) to explore the possibility of equipping all existing crematoriums with LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) furnaces, officials said.In a crematorium that uses LPG, the body is placed directly into a furnace fuelled by LPG thus reducing direct contact.During a video conference with all seven mayors of Haryana, including Gurugram mayor Madhu Azad, Khattar said patients who die of Covid-19 should be cremated at LPG-equipped crematoriums as this method is safer than the traditional method of burning a body over a pyre of wood. He proposed use of LPG facility as it involves minimal contact with the body and reduces the chances of people contracting the infection. He subsequently, directed all mayors to explore into the possibility of equipping all existing crematoriums with LPG furnaces and directed the respective municipal commissioners to initiate a feasibility assessment. Gurugram has one LPG-based crematorium at Madan Puri, next to Pataudi Chowk. Azad said at the other two crematoriums—in Sector 32 and Sukhrali village near Atul Kataria Chowk—the MCG will initiate a feasibility assessment on how to install LPG furnaces. “Any step which can reduce or contain the spread of coronavirus is being evaluated for implementation on a priority basis by the MCG. We will look at the best possible ways to ensure all crematoriums can be made LPG-equipped,” MCG commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh said.On March 7, the MCG had designated six sites for performing last rites of people who die of Covid-19. Aside from the aforementioned cremation sites, three burial grounds at Sector 58 near Power House, Sector 58 near Ghata village and Badshahpur village were approved.Khattar also reiterated the need for constituting local committees, comprising social workers and volunteers, at the polling booth level, to conduct surveys for determining the number of migrant workers in each area under the ‘Distress Ration Token Scheme’ to ensure they can be provided ration from the local government during the lockdown.“The task for determining the number of migrant workers in each locality is underway to ensure they can be provided with adequate ration during the lockdown and nobody goes hungry.

02-05-2020||Gurugram||At Sirhaul toll, families who can’t cross meet at border||Traffic at the Sirhaul toll on the Gurugram-Delhi border was streamlined on Saturday, three days after the Gurugram district administration restricted movement here. Three lanes were dedicated for ambulance, essential services and central government employees for smooth surveillance and verification of documents.Of the 3,100 vehicles that arrived at Sirhaul toll to move into Gurugram on Saturday, 2800 were barred as they failed to furnish document that could establish valid reasons to enter the city. The decision to restrict the movement was taken by the state government after around 10 Covid-19 cases in Gurugram were linked to Delhi. Those not allowed to cross made do with meeting at the border. Over 200 people were seen meeting their family and friends and delivering medicines and other important documents for this reason. Some parents were seeing their children after two months.“The scene was like a border between countries with families on either side unable to cross without a visa. I met my parents almost after two months. Our meeting lasted for only a few minutes. I had tears as I wanted to return with them, but due the job I had, had to remain here,” said Swati Singh, a bank executive who is currently staying at her colleague’s apartment in DLF Phase 2.Another woman was seen holding her newly born and meeting her in-laws from Noida. “I delivered baby 15 days prior to my date. The emergency forced me to move in to one of my friend’s place in Gurugram as my treatment was at a private hospital here. My in-laws were so excited and happy to see their grandson but they had to leave with tears,” said Vinita.Police personnel distributed face mask to commuters who were seen moving without the masks and the temporary set up office and all barricades were sanitized to ensure the personnel are safe and in sanitized atmosphere.The district administration has also started to issue fresh passes for critical emergency movement outside Gurugram. Gurugram deputy commissioner Amit Khatri said they were using the SARAL movement pass system, an online application developed to allow travel during the lockdown. The administration on social media issued an advisory that stated that only a limited number of passes were being approved daily. Khatri said passes will be issued to those who are in need to cross cities for emergency. “No essential supplier will be stopped and neither will companies who are handling IT services involved in Covid-19 work,” he added. However, everyone, will need to have their documents verified.Police said 70% of people who crossed the border on Saturday were doctors and other essential service providers.Muhammad Akil, commissioner of police, said, “We have allowed people who were carrying fresh permission from district administration. The team deployed at the border have allowed several people suffering from a medical emergency to pass even without a valid pass after verifying their other supporting documents,” he said.He said they even allowed people who were carrying their luggage to cross the border after extracting an assurance that they would not return until the lockdown is lifted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/at-sirhaul-toll-families-who-can-t-cross-meet-at-border/story-W4CHF2kbFFEg6KeKTurYeO.html

02-05-2020||City||In times of social distancing, close the emotional gap||I live in a part of Mumbai that was declared a containment zone because of Covid-19. It is one of the 240 plus zones in the city observing the lockdown with a higher level of severity because a resident in the zone tested positive for coronavirus. The patient (I dislike referring to him/her as a ‘case’) was immediately hospitalised. Officials of Brihanmumbai municipal corporation marked the building the patient lived in as an epicentre and a radius of about a kilometre around it as a containment zone. They sanitised and disinfected the building. People in the zone who may have come in direct contact with the patient are being proactively checked and sent for tests. The building’s main gate is kept locked. No resident can drive out of the zone. There is zero movement of cars and two-wheelers. Even people on foot are closely watched and questioned by Mumbai police stationed round-the-clock inside the zone. People are only allowed to leave the area if they have a medical emergency. The state authorities are doing a phenomenal job to enforce social distancing.The other day I left the containment zone to visit a medical store. As I stood in the queue where everyone kept a distance of two metres between each other, I noticed that each one stood stiff, and eerily quiet. People either glanced at each other suspiciously or refused to look each other in the eye. The air was fraught with tension. People didn’t want to even acknowledge that other human beings stood around them. Everyone acted like they were self-sufficient islands and only they mattered. When a water bottle accidentally slipped from a woman’s hand, no one bent down to stop it from rolling down the pavement. And when it was my turn to place the order for medicines with the staff outside the store (no one was allowed to enter), people in the queue perked up their ears to listen to what medicine I asked for, wondering if I needed something to cure a cough or cold. It felt as if they were after my blood!I returned home disturbed. For the first time since the lockdown, I understood why there were reports of residents attacking nurses and doctors, or people ostracising their neighbours and acquaintances simply because they were sent for tests, irrespective of results. Such behaviour was reported from different parts of the country, inside containment zones and outside. Fear and panic combined with misinformation is a lethal combination.Now, with a fresh mind, it’s worth revisiting the one and only norm for the ongoing nationwide lockdown – social distancing. What does it mean? Maintaining a greater than usual “physical distance” from others. Why? To reduce chances of exposure and transmission of a contagious disease. What’s required is only physical distancing which means we can’t meet, congregate, hug each other, or shake hands.But why are we degrading it to emotional distancing? What’s stopping us from sharing a cheerful vibe, being kind in our behaviour or humane in our attitude? Will the virus spread if we look at fellow human beings as people, just like us, battling the unexpected disruption? Will we contract the virus if we spare a smile for the delivery boy and tell him how grateful we are for serving us while we sit in the safety of four walls? Will the virus enter our body if we say “Namaste” to the security guards instead of treating them like they were invisible?If there ever was a time when society needed compassion, it is now. Every person is in the thick of fatigue and multifarious struggles – managing the added burden of household-cum-office work, ensuring safety of dependents, engaging children in a confined space, dealing with the shock of dramatic changes, preparing for financial uncertainties, reworking plans, and dealing with other unforeseen circumstances post the lockdown. Everyone is in an emotionally vulnerable state (I’m not even touching on caregivers of patients battling coronavirus).Hence it is not the time to be selfish or apathetic. In the current times, that amounts to cruelty. Let’s not look at each other as culprits or enemies or virus spreaders. Among the many skills we may want to acquire during this unusual period of quarantine, the most pressing one is upping our emotional quotient. Let’s put in efforts to become sensitive, to care. And if we are privileged enough to have a roof over our heads, own a personal conveyance, and have the money to stock up supplies, let’s be acutely aware of that privilege and understand that we have the bandwidth to be kind to the ecosystem around us. If not us, who?Moreover, by being kind, I don’t mean we have to rise above the needs of our personal safety to become a brave heart volunteer serving in the frontlines. I mean doing simple things. For starters, when you step out for essentials, smile at the people you pass by. Even with a mask on, your smile will shine through your eyes. That may be just what someone needs to pull through a hard day. Say a cheerful word or two to people braving the desolate outdoors, performing their duties. Maybe they wish to realise they matter, that their efforts are valued. Salute or say Jai Hind to the policeman or any other representative of the government to show respect for their service in times as difficult as these.Let this period of social distancing bring out the best in us, not the worst. It’s time to be physically far away, but emotionally nearer than ever.anushasingh3@gmail.com(The author is a writer, lawyer, and corporate communications consultant)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/in-times-of-social-distancing-close-the-emotional-gap/story-mYRJGLjj4v7lvTNfKWsNjI.html
02-05-2020||City||Over 22,000 stranded migrants get ration kits, GB Nagar admin preparing database of needy people||Noida: Amid reports that many stranded migrant workers are battling hunger in Gautam Budh Nagar, the district administration on Friday initiated an exercise to prepare the database of such people who are in need of help. Over 1,200 government employees are in the field to make the database, officials said on Saturday. Also, the officials claimed that over 22,000 families of stranded migrants were provided with ration kits over the past 24 hours in the district. One ration packet is sufficient for a family for one week, they said. While the stranded migrants are now getting ration, new ration cards are also being issued to the eligible families who are resident of Uttar Pradesh, the officials said.Of 22,000 ration kits, 11,000 were the government kits consisting of nine essential food items acquired from the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India (NAFED) while remaining were acquired through donations by city residents or through the corporate social responsibility (CSR).“A number of migrant families were facing hunger like situation. However, the issue was to spot them. Thus a team of over 1,200 officials are in the field to recognise and enlist such families so that benefits reach them. This is a rolling process and the list is still being updated. So far, over 22,000 families were identified and they have been supplied with kits,” said MN Upadhyay, additional district magistrate (finance), Gautam Budh Nagar, who is looking after the ration distribution works among the migrants.He said that the administration had sent a demand of 26,000 ration kits to NAFED, of which 18,000 had been received till Saturday.“Each family will get one kit per week. The standard ration kit has nine items that include five kg atta, five kg rice, three kg potatoes, one kg masoor dal, one kg salt, one litre mustard oil, 200 grams coriander powder, 200 grams turmeric and 200 grams of chili powder. Besides, the CSR kits are also being distributing to the needy people,” Upadhyay said.“We have received feedback that about 30% of the migrant families did not turn up when the ration was being distributed in their areas. We are trying to contact them as well,” he added.Meanwhile, 10,000 new ration cards were issued to the eligible migrant families between May 1 and 2. The officials said that in past 24 hours, they have recognised 11,500 such families, belonging to low-income group, who did not carry a ration card and thus were unable to buy ration from the fair price shops.“We have already issued 10,000 ration cards so far, and will issue more depending on the demands. There are a total of 378 fair price shops across the district. Each cardholder will soon start receiving one kilo channa dal free of cost. We are actively monitoring the public distribution system,” said RN Yadav, district supply officer.“Of 1,85,000 cardholders in the district, about 63% have already received their weekly quota between Friday and Saturday,” Yadav said. When contacted, a number of migrant families stated that they have received the ration kits.“We received ration on Saturday and so did our neighbours, but the quantity was different. Also, it is not clear when will we be supplied again. The ration kit I received had 2 kg atta and rice, half kg dal, oil and sugar, washing and bathing soaps, and a small packet of tea leaf,” said Jyoti Sahu at Shahdara village in Noida Sector 141, a stranded migrant from Madhya Pradesh, who serves as domestic help in the neighbouring high-rises of Sector 137.However, some migrants complained that they were left out. Munnu Kumar Singh, a migrant from Darbhanga district in Bihar who stays at Shahdara village, failed to receive the ration kit. “Some families received the kits and some did not. The persons distributing the kits said that only those with their names in the list will receive. Now, we have given our names as well. They saw our Aadhaar cards, but did not tell us when the ration will arrive,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/over-22-000-stranded-migrants-get-ration-kits-gb-nagar-admin-preparing-database-of-needy-people/story-G0Bqm4yAyzx85TeygA8HeP.html

These trans-Hindon areas have turned out to be major hot spots of Covid-19 over the past fortnight and we need to have better scanning and surveillance,” district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said.Till Saturday evening, the Ghaziabad district collected 3,133 samples for testing and the results of 461 are still pending. The pendency of reports have delayed contact tracing and has also affected the surveillance and containment activities in hot spots.Till Saturday evening, the district has 16 hot spot areas (red zones) and two orange zones, which are step down from red.“The government has taken cognisance of delayed in reports and proper directions are being issued to Noida and Meerut officials to expedite testing. We held a video conferencing with the chief minister on Saturday night and on his directions, we will take a call on opening -- partially or fully -- facilities in the district,” Pandey said.According to the recent communication by the Union health ministry, the Ghaziabad district has moved from a Red zone to an Orange zone, as per the latest classification of districts across the country.Ghaziabad’s chief medical officer (CMO) Dr NK Gupta said three dedicated teams having lab technicians were deputed for random sampling in Indirapuram, Vaishali and Vasundhara areas.On Saturday, three more Covid-19 positive cases were reported in Ghaziabad, taking the tally of cases to 74. Forty-seven persons e were discharged from different hospitals and the number of active cases is 26.“The three positive cases are related to a man from Khoda and another from Modinagar. A woman from Sanjay Nagar who came for dialysis was also tested positive. Three patients were also discharged on Saturday. These included two women who were discharged from Meerut Medical College,” Dr Gupta said.In Uttar Pradesh, the total number of Covid-19 cases was 2,455 (Saturday evening). The state also has 433 hot spot areas under jurisdiction of 286 police station areas. “About three-fourth of positive cases in the state are from hot spot areas. We are also issuing instructions for opening of retail mandis (vegetable markets) for a longer duration of time, from 7am to 7pm. This will help avoid overcrowding. But proper social distancing and sanitization will be ensures in markets,” Awanish Awasthi, UP’s additional chief secretary (home), said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dedicated-teams-for-random-sampling-in-trans-hindon-areas-up-yet-to-decide-on-relaxing-lockdown-norms/story-Cqd8XKXbSH39oZxzoRID7K.html
02-05-2020||City||Covid hot spot: Disinfecting slums poses big challenge for Noida authority||NOIDA: Disinfecting densely populated slum clusters, which have emerged as Covid-19 hot spot in the city, is posing a big challenge for the Noida authority. On Friday, 11 Covid-19 cases were reported from Noida slums, spread chiefly across sectors 5 and 8 with its peripheries also touching sectors 10, 9 and 4. On April 7, the slums had reported the first positive case, and since then 15 persons have tested positive for Coronavirus. Since April 8, officials have shifted around 400 persons from slums in sectors 5 and 8 to government quarantine centres as a precautionary measure after four persons — one of whom was linked to fire safety solutions firm Ceasefire — tested positive for Covid-19 in Sector 5 JJ Colony. Noida authority officials said that their staff are facing more problems in disinfecting slum areas as compared to group housing complexes or plotted houses in the city. In group housing complexes where Covid-19 positive cases were reported, the authority disinfected common areas such as lifts, lobby, clubs, parks and grocery stores without any major hindrances.“But in slum clusters, there are narrow lanes and small houses which are not easily accessible. Our staff have disinfected all the houses, which are located near the patients’ addresses,” said SC Mishra, senior project engineer of the Noida authority heading the health department.On Saturday, the authority deployed 70 staff members who wore PPE kits and then carried out the disinfection drive led by the Gautam Budh Nagar chief medical officer, the officials said, adding that in group housings they did not need health officials.“As we need to ensure that the spread is contained properly, we did take all laid down precautions. We are disinfecting all villages, sectors and other premises twice in a week. Soon, we will carry out a special drive in slums. Drones are being used for disinfection in slums. Our objective is to disinfect surface, air and houses properly,” said Mishra.The authority is tasked to carry out disinfection drive in each nook and corner of slums because the suspected patients might have visited many places nearby which cannot be identified easily, unlike positive cases in group housing or plotted areas, said the officials.“We are carrying out intense house-to-house sanitisation in Covid-affected clusters in sectors 4, 5, 8, 9 and 10,” said Ritu Maheshwari, chief executive officer of Noida authority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-hot-spot-disinfecting-slums-poses-big-challenge-for-noida-authority/story-oKkrL9wNwVNHsHEDyPLrgO.html

02-05-2020||City||HT Chandigarh debate: Time to chalk out economic and welfare plans for migrant labourers and daily wage workers||The one big story that has emerged in the times of the Covid-19 pandemic is the plight of migrants and daily wage workers. A mass exodus began from Delhi in March since the lockdown was announced, with thousands queuing up for buses or rushing to railway stations to take them back to their villages and smaller towns in other states. As governments struggled to come to grips with the matter, some people, unable to find transport, began walking, hoping against hope to reach their destinations alive. Tragically, many died, their hearts unable to bear the hardships, hunger and stress due to displacement. Then came lockdown two in April, triggering another outflow of people from bigger cities stricken with fear of contracting the disease or worse, dying of hunger as all means of survival dried up with construction projects and other labour-intensive services remaining closed. Many were thrown out of their tenements and lodgings by landlords who themselves needed rent to survive. Things have started moving feebly since then with many states slowly realising the extent of the migrant problem and scrambling to get their own people back home. Some migrants have been kept in relief camps and others are being sent back home after mandatory quarantining in special state transport buses, and now in Shramik Special trains.The question that must be on the minds of top government official in the Centre and states is: What now? Kick starting the economy is vital for the survival of every citizen of this country. Though the Union home ministry ordered from April 20 that agricultural and related activities remained fully functional to keep the rural economy going, many states, with the exodus of migrants, are facing labour shortage, a huge problem now with paddy sowing round the corner.Workers are also critical to reopening of industrial and construction activities. What happens when the lockdown is lifted?The learnings from Covid-19 are obvious: It’s time the migrants/daily wage workers get their due. All stakeholders in the farming, industrial and business community should rise to the occasion and invite them back to their cities or villages with good packages, including medical care and education of their children. Future savings and investments should also be made mandatory.All sectors that have reaped rich harvests with the support of these workers cannot be excused for giving them the short shrift in times of a crisis and expecting states or the central government to take care of their needs. Even though a Labour Welfare Fund exists, the migrations from Delhi and other metros prove beyond doubt that the poor are being exploited mercilessly, with no thought given to improving their lot or helping them secure their future.In these times of Covid-19 and looking ahead, plans and policies need to be put in place to ensure these vulnerable communities are looked after and their future secured once normalcy is restored.What should be done to secure the future of daily wage workers/migrant labourers?What steps should farmers/industrialists/local administrations take to secure the future of migrants/daily wage workers once normalcy is restored?

Giving details about the second operation, the AGI said, “We had another tip-off that Gurinder Singh of Jajeani village in Majitha subdivision and Sandeep Singh of Kot Dharam Chand village of Tarn Taran were on their way to smuggle heroin in Ajnala on a Mohindra Scorpio. Immediately, a police team set up a naka at Gujjarpura village.”He said, “The accused came after some time, broke the naka and fled. Our team chased the accused and opened fire to deflate the SUV’s tyres. After a 25-minute chase, the accused were arrested near Chak Mishri Khan village.

02-05-2020||City||Lockdown workout: Ludhiana players turn to gas cylinders, bricks||Making optimum use of empty gas cylinders, tyre tubes, buckets filled with water and bricks, city athletes are doing everything they can to stay fit at home amid the lockdown.Coaches have formed groups on WhatsApp where they post daily workout plan for players. Praveen Thakur, a judo coach, said, “There are around 40 players in my group and I guide them daily about how to make right use of limited sources available at home. This is not only helping in maintaining physical fitness of the players, but also developing a creative mindset for solutions to do exercise at home.”“Players respond with their workout videos and me and another coach, Navdeep Jindal, guide them accordingly to ensure they exercise correctly,” Praveen said.Commonwealth championship gold medallist Prince Kumar shared a video of him using a cycle tube for shoulder and upper back exercise. Similarly, judoka Priya ,who represented India in the World University Games 2019 Summer Universiade, uses eight bricks on her thighs.Athletics coach Sanjeev Sharma is giving meditation sessions to the players. He said while creating a workout schedule for the players, he keeps in mind to add some mobility and stretching exercises along with some lightweight exercises.Sharma said by staying indoors for long, players can be affected by depression, anxiety, etc. “Therefore, along with exercise, I also keep posting motivational videos and messages in the group. I give them different examples of sportspersons, who had been advised bed rest due to illness, like Yuvraj Singh, but they made a comeback by working hard. Such examples motivate players,” he shared.Meanwhile, sports experts suggested that the administration should allow players to go to the stadium for daily workouts.Teja Singh Dhaliwal, general secretary, Punjab Basketball Association, and Jagroop Singh Jarkhar from the Jarkhar Hockey Academy said sitting home for a long time will adversely affect players’ health and future performances. “There should be some relaxation for players. They should be allowed to run on roads in the morning hours or should be allowed to come to the stadium. We will ensure that players do exercise by taking all precautions,” they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lockdown-workout-ludhiana-players-turn-to-gas-cylinders-bricks/story-SKELvTXe4dyAREVkAr636J.html
02-05-2020||City||With 30 districts in virus grip, Bihar braces for trainloads of migrants||PATNAFrom just 12 districts in the state with Covid-19 positive cases at the end of the first spell of lockdown to 30 of the 38 districts as the second spell nears its end has raised concerns for Bihar, which is bracing to receive train loads of its natives stranded across the country.While the number of positive cases was just 66 on April 14 in the state, it reached 475 at 10 am on May 2, with 243 cases reported in seven days between April 25 and May 1.The government has already deferred all leaves of doctors, health officials and contractual employees in the health department till May 31 in view of growing need for surveillance and screening.What is worrying for the state is that many of the new cases reported in the second phase of lockdown are migrants, who somehow managed to reach Bihar and took the infection to newer areas unknowingly as they were largely asymptomatic and did not report.North Bihar districts like Madhubani, Darbhanga, Sitamarhi and Purnea remained free from Covid-19 infection until the last week of the second phase of the lockdown, but now they all have cases. Madhubani, with 13 cases reported on Friday only, has now emerged as the hot spot in north Bihar.Neighbouring Darbhanga has five cases while Sitamarhi has six. East and West Champaran have five cases each, while Seemanchal region has too reported cases - Purnea and Araria (1 each) and Katihar (2).Madhubani district magistrate Dr Nilesh Ramchandra Deor, who is himself a doctor, said all the 13 positive cases detected in the district had been found to be migrants from Delhi, Mumbai and Lucknow, while the origin of the earlier five cases was traced to a woman who came by car from Delhi.“Due to her, another woman, who also travelled in the car and two children, contracted infection,” he said.With Madhubani sharing borders with Nepal and inflow of migrants likely to increase, there are greater concerns for district, famous for exquisite Madhubani paintings and rich cultural heritage, and the surveillance, screening and quarantine facilities have been intensified.“There is lockdown in Nepal also till May 7. People are not coming from that side and if anyone tries to sneak through, it is immediately detected due to heightened surveillance. All outsiders have to spend the required time in the quarantine facilities. There was no positive case in Madhubani earlier, but as migrants have started returning cases have surfaced. The administration is on its toes. We have to remain vigilant,” he added.In Madhubani, five blocks, Jhanjharpur, Rajnagar, Jainagar, Kalyani and Radhika, have reported Covid-19 positive cases. Madhubani and its neighbouring Darbhanga have already been put under ‘orange zone’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/with-30-districts-in-virus-grip-bihar-braces-for-trainloads-of-migrants/story-ATmSjJim1OGhCSpskcUd7J.html

02-05-2020||Lifestyle||Extending help in the time of Covid-19 lockdown||Most NGOs in Delhi-NCR, who had been working for various causes over a number of years, have now joined the fight against Covid-19 pandemic. Among those coming forward to help the underprivileged at such a time is Naad Foundation — a Delhi-based public charitable trust that aims to promote and preserve the cultural heritage of India, and improve the lives of the underprivileged. Since the lockdown was announced, to fight coronavirus, this NGO started feeding thousands of needy in the city, and even provided packets of ready food to those in need. Nishi Singh, founder, Naad Foundation, says, “We have distributed more than three tonnes of ration in various parts of Delhi. Since the beginning of the lockdown, we are making tremendous efforts to mitigate the difficulties faced by the daily wage workers.” Alongside the dry ration, which includes flour, vegetables, rice, pulses and oil, this foundation has also distributed masks and sanitizers to the underprivileged, to help them stay safe from coronavirus. Singh — who is a singer, painter and poet — says, “We get random calls for help, and we don’t disappoint them. I try to reach everyone in need. Last year, we had adopted 40 kids from a government school in Rohini, and we are taking care of them as well.” It’s, however, the social work that motivates Singh to keep working for the betterment of the society. “Helping others gives me lot of satisfaction and strength. I would like to request everyone to extend help to the less privileged in such difficult times. Together we can...and we will,” adds Singh. The foundation’s work has been appreciated by many, through social media, and even otherwise. Sunita Sehgal Kalra, expressing gratitude for the efforts of Singh and her foundation, wrote on Facebook: “Thank you so much for reaching the unreachable areas and providing food to my staff members, who live in nearby areas but we were not able to reach them.” Vikke Anand, another social media user extended gratitude to them, for helping a destitute: “Thank you so much for helping the poor. I received a call from the poor lady who was starving due to lockdown, she has received ration.” Follow @htTweets for more||https://www.hindustantimes.com/more-lifestyle/extending-help-in-the-time-of-covid-19-lockdown/story-IUBvxvB5vinu4luFJyEchP.html
02-05-2020||Lucknow||A garbage cart for a ride, surviving on biscuits & miles from home||May 1 Labour Day SpecialA makeshift motorised cart chugs down the roads of Lucknow at night. Lallan Pandit is steering the modified bike in front of the cart as it moves with a low-pitch rattle. Behind, in the open cart, are six men, their backs to each other, legs hanging over the cart, as they move along the deserted road, trying to reach home.“Yahan kahin paani mil jayega, hamare pas pani khatam ho gaya hai (Can we get water some place here),” said Pandit, as he stops the rickshaw at a crossing on the Lucknow-Sultanpur highway.Just a month earlier, the men, all hailing from Madhubani, Bihar, were doing different jobs in Jaipur, 1,200 kilometres from home.Pandit drove the cart which was used to carry municipal garbage. Randheer Patel, 42, the eldest of the group packed food in a restaurant. The youngest, 20-year-old, Manish, was an assistant at a tailor’s shop along with Rakesh, 24, who sat behind him in the cart. Keval Yadav, 40, drove a pedal rickshaw on which he carried tourists around the Pink City. Manish, 35, worked as motor mechanic, while Nagendra, 30 worked as a waiter. They all lived nearby.“Humlog 14 April ka intezar kar rahe they, ki lockdown khule aur hum ghar jaye. Par fir lockdown badh gaya aur ham niklne ka sochne lage (We had been waiting for the lockdown to get over on April 14. But when it got extended we began thinking of leaving the place,” said Pandit.The lockdown which was put in place on March 25 was extended till May 3 on April 14.The men first planned to walk back home but the distance was too much. Then they planned renting bicycles but eventually decided to travel on the makeshift rickshaw. They put in Rs 2,500 each from their meagre savings to buy the motorised cart and put on new tyres. Rs 1,500 were kept aside for fuel. They tied their bags on the side of the cart and left Jaipur on the night of May 25.Lallan and Nagendra shared the driving. The group drove for around five hours every day to avoid straining the engine. They drove in the night and slept and washed during the day. “Din mein har jagah police wale rok lete hain. Marte hain, pareshan karte hain, isiliye hum log rat main chalte hain (We travel only during the night because during the day, policemen trouble us. They stop us and even beat us),” Ranjit said.But with almost all their money spent on buying the rickshaw the men hardly had anything left to buy food. Packets of glucose biscuits was all they could buy.In the four-day long journey they only ate biscuits, some which they bought, others which they got from people along the journey. “Kabhi socha nahi tha biscuit kha ke guzara karna padega. Par nahi khayenge to mar jayenge, humko pochhne wala kaun hai (Never had we thought that we will have to survive on biscuits. But we will die if we don’t eat it. Who is there to ask about us),” said Yadav, the pain and despair apparent in his voice.Yadav had to pay back a loan of 2 lakh taken from local money lender for the marriage of his sister. Randheer is saving for his daughter’s marriage scheduled next year. Pandit has a family of seven to feed. Manish and Nagendra don’t have any farm to survive upon and Rajesh can’t find a job in the village or in Bihar.Each of them has a reason for working far from home and no matter how much they hate it, the same reason will make them leave their houses again, soon. “Gaon main kuch kam nahi hai. Wahan bhooke mar jayenge. Wapas kam par to jana hi padega (There is no work in the village. We will die of hunger there and will have to return to our jobs)” Nagendra said.In Lucknow, the group drank water from a tap near a roadside mosque. They filled their bottles and hopped back on the cart. Patel kick-started the engine and the overloaded cart moved, slowly melting into the darkness.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/a-garbage-cart-for-a-ride-surviving-on-biscuits-miles-from-home/story-q5LtIJ3LDuM4rNpVz9uXNI.html

Patna divisional commissioner Sanjay Agarwal, DM Kumar Ravi, SSP Upendra Sharma, city SP Ashok Mishra and senior RPF officials were present at the railway station to oversee the arrangements.The migrants were allowed to alight from the train one by one and then taken to the railway school for medical examination and thermal screening. Thirteen rooms had been prepared in the railway school for their stay. Twenty five medical teams comprising of four members each with thermal scanner were deployed to examine the migrants.After the medical check-up, all the workers were sent to their home districts in over 100 buses arranged by the transport department of the state government. “The seating arrangements in buses have been made keeping in mind social distancing norms. Buses will ply half compared to their seating capacity,” divisional commissioner Sanjay Agarwal said.“During the screening, none of the passengers was found symptomatic. After breakfast, they were sent to their home districts, where another screening will take place,” said a senior railway official. Agarwal said, “All the migrant workers who were sent to their respective districts would be kept in quarantine centres situated in the block where they will live for 21 days.” The Patna DM said, “All the migrants are staying in different camps, under medical supervision, and all of them are healthy.”A railway board official said after de-boarding the passengers, the empty train will return once the train is sanitised and all the coaches will be locked meticulously to avoid entry of anybody.The official said only 54 passengers are allowed per coach, which has a capacity of 72 in order to follow social distancing norms.  The passengers travelling in these trains will be checked for Covid-19 and only those without symptoms will be allowed to travel, said the official. “Each passenger is expected to keep his or her mouth covered.

02-05-2020||City||Delhi govt launches online spoken English programme for class 10, 12 students||New Delhi: The Delhi government on Saturday launched a spoken English and personality development online programme for class 10 and 12 students studying in its schools.Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia on Saturday made the announcement during his weekly session -- Parenting in the time of Corona. The programme was launched in collaboration with the British Council and MacMillan Education.Under this initiative, students will be sent links via SMS from Monday. “Almost 1,60,000 students of class 10 and 1,12,000 students of class 12 have appeared for their board exams are awaiting their results. We decided to launch spoken English and personality development classes (online) for them to make apt use of their free time at home. No child should feel inferior for not being able to communicate in it. Hindi is our language, and the mode of communication and teaching is in Hindi only, but we cannot overlook the importance and relevance of English today. To progress further at the national and international levels, our students should have good command over the language. And that is why we are starting the classes from Monday,” Sisodia said.Explaining the course design, the representatives of the British Council and Macmillan Education said, “The course is divided into two parts. First is Everyday English where students will be taught the functional usage of English. The second part is personality development where students will be taught about peer pressure and made to learn basic skills like facing an interview. The students of class 10 and 12 will receive an SMS with a link every day. The link will take them to the assigned webpage for that day and then the child will be able to navigate to activities of the day.”Director of education Binay Bhushan said the initiative will give students an opportunity to make good use of their time amid the lockdown. “The classes will go on in May and June and will help in adding to the confidence of the students,” he said.The Delhi government had last week launched an online Mathematics classes for class 9 and 10 students. As many as 120,000 students have attended these classes in the first week. “It is important to understand that these online classes are not to be taken as parallel teaching. Our teachers should not think that. They have to start from scratch when the schools reopen and get under pressure. it is a part of the overall teaching, it should be complementing each other,” Sisodia said.Besides, the Delhi government is conducting online classes for class 12 students to minimise the academic loss amid the lockdown. As many as 1,50,000 students have registered for it. The DoE is sending daily activities for students of classes Nursery to 8.

The city police on Saturday garlanded at least 30 people who were out for a morning walk amid the curfew. Inspector Jarnail Singh, Division Number 8 station house officer (SHO), said despite lodging FIRs and putting these violators in open jail, many people continued to roam on the streets.The inspector said there were complaints that residents in posh localities, including Club Road, Civil Lines, College Roads and Ghumar Mandi, were stepping out for morning walk.“We formed teams and deputed them at different locations. As soon as the people came out, the police garlanded them and requested them to stay indoors,” said the SHO.“Most of the people made excuses, such as they live nearby and came outside for a short walk, while some said they were out to fetch milk or other essentials,” he added.The police have already arrested 665 curfew violators in 382 cases. Besides, 14,170 people have been rounded up since the curfew was imposed on March 23.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/police-garland-curfew-violators-in-ludhiana/story-MPmMQH2CaOWWUC6Uvhs9PI.html

In his letter to CM, Longowal said they have already apprised the government that they have good arrangements for the pilgrims returning from Nanded and instead of quarantining them at any other place, they should be kept in the serais. “However, our plea was not entertained,” he added.SAD SEEKS PROBE INTO ‘MALTREATMENT’ OF RETURNEES Meanwhile, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) has demanded a probe into the alleged maltreatment of Nanded-returnees at quarantine facilities in Punjab. In a statement here, party spokesman Daljit Singh Cheema said it is shocking that despite a hue and cry among people over the unhygienic conditions under which the pilgrims have been quarantined, chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh has not deemed it fit to order an inquiry into the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/shift-nanded-returnees-to-gurdwara-serais-sgpc/story-eyTOLaMsJJ9bALJ8aPVLZK.html

The helpline numbers, that got operational on Friday, have already received over 500 calls from parents, school heads, teachers and students from across the state.As the schools are closed due to the lockdown, many parents called on these numbers seeking advice on how to enrol their wards in these schools, department officials said. “Since yesterday, I received over 40 calls. In most of the calls, parents have been enquiring regarding the admission process. Earlier, parents used to enrol their children in government schools by visiting the schools, but as the schools are closed due to the lockdown, they are facing problems. But, I have guided the parents on how to contact the schools that are near them,” said Gurjot Singh, assistant director, DPI secondary.The district education officers (DEOs) have also been asked to provide numbers of school heads, he adds.Meanwhile, most of the schools have developed online pro forma for the parents and have shared it through WhatsApp groups of students and school management committees so that it can be shared with those who want to get their wards enrolled in government schools.Assistant director at DPI secondary office, Kuwinder Kaur, said, “I am receiving calls from both school principals and parents for admissions. Parents have been suggested to admit their wards online as majority of the schools have come up with their online pro formas to admit the child. I have also shared the information with the respective DEOs so that parents can admit their wards in the nearest government school easily.”“I wanted to enrol my two children in the government school nearby. My neighbour informed me regarding the helpline numbers, so I called them and got guidance and completed the enrolment process,” said Sevak Ram, who lives near Sherpur Chowk and had migrated to Ludhiana from Bihar in January this year.

02-05-2020||Chandigarh||Health officials collect samples after protest by quarantined labourers in Faridkot||Around 60 labourers, who have been kept at Abbnoor Polytechnic College, a quarantine centre on Ferozepur road here, on Saturday blocked the road in protest against the district administration for not collecting their samples for Covid-19 tests even after three days.These labourers had returned to Faridkot district from different parts of Madhya Pradesh, Haryana and Rajasthan on Wednesday. The labourers, who operated combine harvesters, were stuck in other states for over a month due the lockdown.However, the labourers lifted the protest and returned inside the quarantine centre after officials assured them that their samples will be collected promptly. A health department team was rushed to the quarantine centre to collect the swab samples of the workers. The labourers also alleged that there are poor arrangements at the quarantine centre.Deputy commissioner Kumar Saurabh Raj said health officials had started collecting samples of these labourers and the process will be completed by the evening. “More than 1,000 persons have returned to the district in a week and the samples of Nanded-returnees were collected first. We have provided all facilities to them,” he added. Sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Paramdeep Singh said, “The district administration is providing three meals to the labourers, besides filtered water and tea. The centres are being cleaned regularly and washrooms are clean.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/health-officials-collect-samples-after-protest-by-quarantined-labourers-in-faridkot/story-w3fBdmkbGanNgumey7obGK.html
02-05-2020||Chandigarh||Covid lockdown: EPFO simplifies e-return for businesses||The Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) has relaxed the norms for filing of electronic-challan-cum-return (ECR) in the wake of the Covid-19 lockdown.To ease the compliance procedure under the Employees’ Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952, the filing of monthly ECR has been separated from payment of the statutory contributions reported in the ECR.The ECR can now be filed by an employer without the need of simultaneous payment of contributions and the latter can be paid later by the employer after filing the ECR.“Filing of ECR by the employer on time is indicative of employer’s intent to comply and will not therefore attract penal consequences if the dues are paid within the extended time,” said Dheeraj Gupta, regional commissioner, EPFO.Gupta urged the establishments to file the ECR on time, stating that it will help in the credit of employers’ and employees’ contribution, totalling 24% of wages by the Central government to low wage earners in establishments eligible under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana package. “The current ECR data shall also help in policy planning and decision-making in relation to providing further relief to businesses and EPF members affected by the pandemic,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/covid-lockdown-epfo-simplifies-e-return-for-businesses/story-avU2E8QvmgId2B99CQlLHM.html

02-05-2020||Chandigarh||Increase testing capacity to 6,000 a day by May 15: Capt Amrinder Singh||CHANDIGARH Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Saturday asked the health department to ramp up the RT-PCR Covid testing facilities in the state to 6,000 a day by the May 15, instead of the targeted 5,800 a day by May-end.Chairing a cabinet meeting through video-conferencing, the CM directed the health department to conduct fresh tests on all returnees instead of relying on screening done in other states. The CM said as several staffers at the Hazur Sahib gurdwara had tested positive, the Akali Dal’s claim that there were no positive cases in the Nanded and the pilgrims had got infected on the way back or on reaching Punjab had been trashed.“This was a crucial time in the state’s fight against Covid-19,” the CM said. Directing the health department to come out with a plan to advance its schedule for increasing the testing capacity, the Amarinder stressed the need to be prepared for the worst. The CM said he had already asked the chief secretary to coordinate with the central government to scale up the testing capacity to 20,000 a day to cope with the influx of migrants and others expected to return to the state over the next few weeks in the wake of the new directives of the Government of India.Amarinder said he had also asked the vice-chancellor of Baba Farid University of Health Sciences, Faridkot, to explore the feasibility of setting up a testing facility in Jalandhar for which the government was ready to sanction an immediate grant of Rs 1 crore.In response to a suggestion by some ministers, the CM agreed to examine their proposal for home quarantine of the returnees in coordination with panchayats.Meanwhile, the Cabinet on Saturday approved extension of parole period beyond 16 weeks during epidemics and disasters, for those sentenced to 7 years or less.The cabinet also cleared various appointments, on outsourcing basis, for critical posts at the government medical colleges in Patiala, Amritsar and Faridkot. The appointments, already approved by the finance department for six months, will enable the government medical colleges to appoint vital staff in the viral testing laboratories, isolation wards etc, to enable 24X7 functioning, said an official spokesperson.The committee headed by Dr Raj Bahadur will decide and finalsze the appointments for the posts of specialist doctors, nurses, ward attendants, technicians, lab attendants, apart from directors and other.The cabinet was informed that proposal has been sent to the Government of India to set up four new labs in the district hospitals at Barnala, Rupnagar, Ludhiana and Hoshiarpur. Additionally, a proposal to procure 15 TruNaat machines has been moved. State is also considering starting CBNaat testing in Patiala and Faridkot.The cabinet also accorded ex-post facto approval to the appointment of 4,300 guardians of governance and agreed to amend the transfer policy of the school education department to allow teachers seeking transfer after 18 months of posting in the border areas, instead of the earlier 3 years, once new recruitments are completed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/increase-testing-capacity-to-6-000-a-day-by-may-15-capt-amrinder-singh/story-0dRvexh34T6FDqPNR4C6JO.html
02-05-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab staff unions flay delay in release of salaries||The Sanjha Mulazam Manch Punjab and UT on Saturday criticised the state government for delay in releasing salaries due to a proposal to impose pay cut.At a meeting of the conveners of different unions through video conferencing, the Sanjha Mulazam Manch objected to the refusal of district treasury offices to accept salary bills of employees on verbal instructions from the government.“District treasuries usually start accepting salary bills from 25th of each month, but they are not accepting it this time. This is because of a proposal to cut salaries of state employees,” said Sukhchain Singh Khehra, convener-cum-coordinator of the union, in a statement.He said the proposal was to cut pay of two to three days every month for different categories of employees over the next one year. “Government employees are on the frontline in the fight against Covid-19 and the government should give them extra salary instead of imposing a pay cut,” he said.The union’s conveners also criticised the proposal to deduct mobile allowance of employees stating that this meagre amount was proving too much for the government but MLAs, MPs and ministers were being given Rs 15,000 telephone allowance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-staff-unions-flay-delay-in-release-of-salaries/story-8aJCIEFj4u32uhF2qx5kTL.html
02-05-2020||Chandigarh||Nanded-returnees put Punjab on the defensive in fight against Covid-19||Just when the Covid-19 situation seemed to be back under control in Punjab after the initial NRI and Tablighi Jamaat scares, the return of 4,000 stranded pilgrims from Takht Hazur Sahib in Nanded, Maharashtra, over the week has emerged as a bigger challenge for the state in its fight against coronavirus.Extending the curfew till May 17 two days before the Centre decided on Lockdown 3.0, the Capt Amarinder Singh-led Congress government in Punjab knows it is in for a tough battle. Within three days, every second Covid-19 patient in the state is a pilgrim back from Maharashtra. Of today’s 750 positive cases in the state, 360 are pilgrims back from Nanded.The pilgrims from across Punjab, Haryana and Delhi were stuck in Nanded for more than a month since the nationwide lockdown. Akal Takht jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh and Union minister and Bathinda Akali MP Harsimrat Kaur Badal were quick to take up the cause of the pilgrims with the central and state governments.Not to be seen to be lagging, the Punjab government urged the Centre and its Maharashtra counterpart to facilitate the return of the pilgrims.Capt Amarinder Singh is learnt to have spoken to his counterparts in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan to allow hassle-free passage to Punjab.The credit war between the Badals and the chief minister was cut short with news of pilgrims testing positive for Covid-19 started emerging. With other states dithering, Punjab sent its own buses to bring back its natives but the risk of coronavirus spreading grew by the day.‘SOP NOT FOLLOWED, NANDEDGURDWARA MGMT TRUSTED’More than 600 pilgrims entered Punja’b by hiring local vehicles and those provided by the gurdwara management by April 26. They were sent to home quarantine after thermal screening. The samples of a few suspected cases were taken in Tarn Taran.On April 27, three residents of Tarn Taran district tested positive. In a knee-jerk reaction, principal secretary, health, Anurag Verma ordered that all Nanded returnees be sent to state government facilities.Punjab Police was tasked with bringing back the pilgrims and their contacts from home quarantine to the state facilities for testing.A senior government functionary claimed that the state government did not follow the standard operating procedure in bringing back the pilgrims and relied on information provided by the gurdwara management that claimed that the pilgrims were tested thrice during their stay.AC BUSES SHOULD’VE BEEN AVOIDEDExperts say the next blunder was sending air-conditioned buses to bring back the pilgrims when it’s known that that the contagious virus spreads fast in such an environment.Given the high number of Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra, as it happens to be the worst-hit state in the country, the state government should have been cautious in screening all pilgrims returning from there.PUNJAB BLAMES MAHARASHTRAThe Punjab government now its Maharashtra counterpart for giving it wrong information about the health status of the pilgrims.“The Maharashtra government did not clarify properly if these pilgrims were tested or not. They kept telling us since Nanded is a green zone, pilgrims are safe and tests have been performed on them,” Punjab health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu said.The credit war has now turned into a blame game between the Congress government and the opposition Shiromani Akali Dal. The Akal Takht jathedar has also wriggled out of the controversy, saying that it’s all a conspiracy to defame the Sikh community.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/nanded-returnees-put-punjab-on-the-defensive-in-fight-against-covid-19/story-6shGb9HTCasbp2Z8LZfdyL.html

This year, no water cut has been imposed. We are getting interrupted water supply,” said Dhumal Rana, 45, a Panvel resident.During the lockdown, Panvel is getting 30 mld (millions of litres per day) of water which is the actual requirement for the area.Panvel City Municipal Corporation (PCMC) is managing to supply more water as industries as shut.Jamir Lengrekar, deputy commissioner of PCMC, said, “We have ensured that people don’t face water crisis. Water which would have been consumed by industries has been diverted for residential use.”“Only some industries are operating at MIDC Taloja. While in full operation, industries require 50 mld,” said an MIDC official.Every year, summer is marked by protests and complaints for residents. This year, they are thanking the lockdown. “Last year, we spent more than a lakh towards tanker water supply. We are relaxed this year as we don’t have to worry about water this summer,” said Shivam Patel, 50, a resident of Sector 21 in Kamothe.Kantilal Kadi, a city-based activist, said civic officials can work out a system so that residents do not face water cuts even when the industries are functioning. “I feel that officials can work out an uninterrupted water supply every year,” added Kadi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/with-industries-shut-panvel-residents-get-24x7-water-supply-this-summer/story-IWG9tGNRK0CiE9v2yUQq4N.html

But the final decision is yet to be taken,” he added.As HT reported earlier, hundreds of cancer patients are stranded in Mumbai. Cancer patients are most vulnerable to acquiring the infection due to their low immunity. Many of them have taken shelters in crowded dharamshalas or lodges. Now, as the government has provided some relaxations in transportation, TMH, the biggest cancer hospital in India is trying to send these patients back home. The hospital has already provided alternative accommodation to several patients and their kin in the city.

02-05-2020||City||Tricity buzz: HT Chandigarh reporters’ tracker on all those making, or faking, news amid coronavirus lockdown||When baton-wielding SSP left many surprised in BurailIt’s rare to find a senior superintendent of police (SSP) patrolling the streets with a baton or a stick. The Covid-19 pandemic led Chandigarh SSP Nilambari Jagadale to do a reality check and patrol the congested areas in town. Last week, SP, city, Vineet Kumar accompanied her as she went around asking people about their curfew passes at Burail village. Her presence sure surprised many a resident as they are used to engaging with beat officials and PCR staff on a daily basis but not a senior IPS officer. Covid confusion for namesakes in KhararTheir common name has led to many a confusion but the other day it triggered a fight over none other than humanity’s biggest enemy: Covid-19. Kuldeep Kaur, 65, and her namesake cousin daughter-in-law, 56, returned from Takht Hazur Sahib, Nanded, last week. Both residents of Choti Nagli village in Kharar were put up in a quarantine centre and their samples were taken to check for coronavirus infection. The 65-year-old tested positive but refused to accept the result, claiming she was hale and hearty. An argument ensued when she expressed the doubt that the result may have been that of the younger Kuldeep Kaur. The drama went on till health officials intervened and admitted the 65-year-old to a hospital though she still didn’t believe them.SHO becomes talking point among cops after encounterOn arresting four men wanted for attempt to murder after an encounter in Panchkula recently, the station house officer of Phase 8, Rajnish Chaudhary, who led the team, became a talking point in his department. Police personnel posted in Mohali say “encounters are Chaudhary’s passion”. They say he keeps a bullet-proof jacket handy in his vehicle because safety always comes first. Though no cop opened fire in this incident, constable Rashpreet Singh was shot in the left leg by a gangster before his accomplices and he were caught.Health dept fighting Covid-19 info leakThe health department in Chandigarh is dealing with new kind of challenge: Information leak. As the city’s corona count climbed through the week, the department found that the information was being broken on social media even before the reports reached the top brass. Director health services, Chandigarh, Dr G Dewan said that the administration has taken serious note. A senior doctor on the operational front at Government Multi-Specialty Hospital, Sector 16, admitted that over the past few days, he had been receiving official confirmation after the news was all over social media.Repairmen caught off guardThe list of repairmen drafted by the Chandigarh administration wasn’t made after consulting them. For instance, an air conditioner serviceman in zone 3 said that his name was given in the final list without informing him. “My father died recently and I won’t be back on duty for at least a week. Now I’m redirecting the calls.” PEC director takes online classDheeraj Sanghi, the director of Punjab Engineering College (PEC), ensures the faculty feels like family. While all teachers are busy preparing online modules for students to make sure the academic year is not wasted, Sanghi joined in and prepared an online lecture, too.

The matter should be investigated,” said a government employee in Uri, on the condition of anonymity.A government teacher posted at zone Jhulla of Uri on Saturday received an SMS from her Zonal Education Office (ZEO) which reads, “All the employees of zone Jhulla are hereby informed that this office is going to deduct one day’s salary of all the employees for Covid-19 relief fund. It is a noble cause and for the people of Uri only if anyone is not willing he/she may communicate to the ZEO office through WhatsApp. Matter treated as urgent”.Another employee wishing not to be named said, “There are some employees at SDM office who might be getting benefit from this fund.”Uri treasury officer Rouf Ahmad said that he has been appointed as the head of the audit in the committee. “Everything is being monitored by the SDM himself. He takes a call on how to use the funds,” he said.SDM Uri Reyaz Ahmad Malik denied commenting on the issue.Secretary to the government for the department of law, justice and parliamentary affairs in J&K Achal Sethi said, “The SDM level officer has no authority to issue such orders.”Kashmir divisional commissioner PK Pole said he has directed the DC Baramulla to look into the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/uri-sdm-issues-order-asking-govt-employees-to-donate-one-day-s-salary-to-fight-covid-19/story-KYTivepghJ8ExwbsKEBW5O.html

02-05-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai police distributes travel registration forms to migrant workers||Mumbai police has started manual distribution of registration forms to migrant workers, stranded in the city due to lockdown, to enable them to travel back to their homes.The forms are being distributed in person at food distribution points, community kitchens, relief camps and shelters, said Mumbai police officials.The forms are being distributed after the Indian Railways announced special Shramik trains for migrant workers, and the relaxation given by the Ministry of Home Affairs for inter-state road transport for migrant workers, pilgrims and students during the lockdown.Mumbai police officials said that most migrant workers come from poor backgrounds and do not have access to the internet which limits their scope for applying online, following which the top brass of the city decided to hand over the forms to the migrants themselves.A senior police officer said that the police already know where most of the migrants are living. After the Bandra incident (wherein over 1,000 migrants had turned up near Bandra railway station on April 14) cops had located those pockets in the city where most of the stranded migrants, laborers are living in clusters to provide them food and other essential items.Bandra, Wadala TT, areas along with the docks like Sewri, Mazgaon, Reay Road, Cotton Green, Govandi, Mankhurd, Chembur, in North Borivali and Kandivali are the pockets where most of the stranded migrant labourers are residing.“To reach out to maximum stranded migrant workers, pilgrims, students our men at the police station level are distributing forms manually. Many migrants are given forms at the food distribution points, community kitchens and at the migrants relief camps and shelters,” said Vinoy Kumar Choubey, additional director general (Law & Order), Mumbai police.Public announcements are being made in the slums to discourage migrant workers from rushing to police stations or railway stations with the forms. Only one member of a group would be allowed to visit police stations with the required documents.“The stranded migrants are given forms with the instructions that they must avoid to apply for a single person’s travel and instead form groups of 25 to 40, and apply together in groups. They are also being informed about the strict compliance of conditions such as health clearance certificate from a registered doctor, Aadhar card details, etc.,” Choubey said.“Separate teams under zonal DCPs, who are the nodal officers for this task, would segregate the collected forms and then in coordination with the Railways and state road transport department transport will be arranged”, added Choubey.“Once we get forms of around 1,000 stranded migrants wishing to go to the same destination we would approach railways to arrange a train for the said destination”, he said.Migrants stranded in containment areas are not included in this set up, irrespective of their health conditions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-police-distributes-travel-registration-forms-to-migrant-workers/story-EMyLyn1tK9QNND6urruycK.html

The state government should stop levying this ‘jaziya tax’ on people of state,” the Congress leaders said.Criticising the state government, leader of opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda said during the all-party meeting on Thursday he had suggested that government provide immediate relief to people in form of payment of electricity bills, loan payments, rent and taxes. “The state should take loans to provide relief to those caught in distress.

02-05-2020||Lucknow||Area of containment zones may be reduced for industrial activity in UP||The Uttar Pradesh government is planning to redefine the area of containment zones, from the existing 3 km to a lesser area, to enable industries in such zones also to start operation whenever permissible, said Navneet Sehgal, principal secretary, MSME, on Friday.“This move will help industries in containment zones in Noida, Greater Noida and rest of the state to start functioning,” said Sehgal while speaking to industrialists during a webinar organised by PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry.At present, in any area designated as hotspot due to a large number of Covid-19 cases, no activity is allowed in a radius of 3 km, which is also defined as containment zone.Informing about the portal ‘msmesathi’, Sehgal said: “It will be launched in the next two days. Here industrialists can report all issues which will be addressed.”Also present at the event, MSME minister Siddharth Nath Singh assured the industrialist all help from the state government.“New guidelines are likely come from the centre for industries to help restart production,” said Singh.He also stressed on retaining the existing workforce or else it would be difficult for industries to find replacements.Industrialist DK Agarwal suggested actual charges for electricity and water consumption in industries instead of fixed charges for the next six months. Industrialist Lalit Khaitan suggested resumption of production in liquor units as they contribute most to the state exchequer.Businessman Mahesh Gupta stressed on reopening of service sector to enable sale of manufactured goods.“Sale of goods is equally important. If we manufacture goods and there is no sale then there is no point in starting industrial activity,” said Gupta.Businessman Gaurav Prakash took up the issue of converting lease land into free hold plots in industrial areas across the state. ED Park, a representative from South Korea, suggested that the state government must set up a dedicated UP Chapter (or help desk) in Noida to help South Korean companies, who want to relocate from China, set up units in the region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/area-of-containment-zones-may-be-reduced-for-industrial-activity-in-up/story-wrF7rsyyn2Apogc6bMOgyH.html
02-05-2020||Delhi||Delhi will never have a flâneur like RV Smith, friends remember the man of the world||Before heritage walks became a trend, before the term street food was coined, before it became fashionable to be a flâneur, there was an unassuming man who redefined the way one looked at their city. RV Smith to the world, and Ronny to his friends, he died in the early hours of April 30. He was 83. Those close to him say that he was hospitalised for two days and had been ailing for some time. RV Smith, the chronicler of our great city Delhi passed away this morning. His work kept alive the stories and memories of our city. It's a huge loss especially for Delhiites. My heartfelt condolences to his family and friends. RIP Author, chronicler, food connoisseur, qissago (storyteller), Smith donned many hats in his lifetime, each with perfection. He had a small circle of friends whom he hosted with the generosity of someone who can be called a man of the world. His life was as colourful as the stories he culled out from the gulleys and koochas of the Capital city. It wouldn’t be entirely wrong, then, to call him the King of Queens. His friends recall their memories with him, and how he would win hearts in just one fleeting moment.Author Rakshanda Jalil, says, “He was very fond of food. He could recall flavours, tastes and textures. He remembered in minute detail the gulleys and mohallas of Delhi, and that set him apart. Always an anecdote, a qissa on his fingertips that he would recall from memory. He was, in true sense, a flâneur. He discovered the city by walking around; his feet have discovered Delhi. He was not very tech savvy and continued writing on his typewriter. He would have to go to an internet café to open an email.”  He loved the company of kind, beautiful women, especially when they happened to be writers... writer Sadia Dehlvi and writer Rakhshanda Jalil with Delhi chronicler RV Smith, who died this morning... captured this memory a couple of seasons ago... somewhere in Delhi #memoryA post shared by  Mayank Austen Soofi (@thedelhiwalla) on Apr 29, 2020 at 10:28pm PDTAuthor Sadia Dehlvi, says, “He was a very simple, hardworking, humble person. I have known him since I was 18 years old and had just started writing. Even Khushwant (Singh) would say that he is the best chronicler of Delhi. He was there and it was comforting to know that he was there. I would check my facts with him when writing on Delhi. He would host a Christmas lunch every year which would always have biryani and qorma. Ronny would write hand-written articles and wasn’t into marketing. He lived in his own world; he didn’t belong to this world. His stories were legendary and he was very popular with women before he got married.”Author Rana Safvi, says, “Delhi is bereaved because it has lost its chronicler and beloved son. Whenever I wanted to find something very uncommon and unknown about Delhi, I would turn to his works. There is a Bheem ka Patthar in Mehrauli about which there is no mention in history books and which probably no one has ever seen. It remains largely a part of folklore, but when I wanted to write about it, I referred to his work. Things you could not find anywhere were available in his books. He has chronicled things which no one else could reach. We look at a place from the point of view of history, but he saw it through the lens of folk tales and qisse-kahaaniya.”   Remains of a Writer... what will happen to the lovely Underwood typewriter of Delhi chronicler RV Smith who died this morning... he wrote on it every day... it was given to him by his father... saw this precious scene of him at work... somewhere in Delhi #writerA post shared by  Mayank Austen Soofi (@thedelhiwalla) on Apr 30, 2020 at 12:22am PDTPublisher Priya Kapoor of Roli Books, says, “He was very old world. We never met during the whole process of publishing the book because he had sent us the submission in hard copy. He would correspond over hard copies, landline phone calls or postcards. The last postcard I received from him was over a year and a half ago.”Interact with Etti Bali at @TheBalinianFollow @htlifeandstyle for more||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-will-never-have-a-flaneur-like-rv-smith-friends-remember-the-man-of-the-world/story-mtONsQZVFXxqnsZoQYxSaM.html

There should be awareness drives in villages, with messages blared on loudspeakers about precautions needed in the current situation,” the chief minister said.The incidence of coronavirus outbreak in the state was low, initially, but there has been a spike of late, partly because of people coming from outside Bihar, carrying the infection, he said. Bihar has reported 466 Covid-19 cases till Friday.“Now, we must brace ourselves for the situation that may arise out of a large influx that is expected in the wake of the Centre’s revised guidelines with regard to the lockdown,” he said.The chief minister also said, “We must now have many more testing centres. If required, these should be available at the district level. Accordingly, testing kits too must be arranged and adequate supply of medicines should be ensured.” At present, testing of samples is being conducted at only six places the RMRI, an ICMR centre here, AIIMS, Patna, besides state-run hospitals PMCH and IGIMS, both situated in the capital city, in addition to SKMCH at Muzaffarpur and DMCH at Darbhanga.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe seventh testing facility at Jawahar Lal Nehru Medical College and Hospital in Bhagalpur is scheduled to become functional from Sunday.Kumar also took note of the economic distress that awaited the migrant workers who eked out a living in far-off places and are returning home as stalled economic activity following the nationwide lockdown has rendered them jobless.“Many projects underway in Bihar happen to be labour- intensive. Once the dust settles down, a survey should be conducted to assess the skills these migrant labourers might have and they should be absorbed in the workforce accordingly,” he said.He also expressed distress over the social media being replete with “fake news” and malicious content that tended to stigmatise individuals and communities.The chief minister ordered officials to keep a close watch and take stern action against those found to be involved in “vitiating the atmosphere”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/bihar-braces-for-massive-influx-of-migrants-nitish-asks-officials-to-pull-up-their-socks/story-mcu0GL6w53yF0LjASQOTvK.html

02-05-2020||Mumbai||9 Maharashtra seats to go to polls on May 21||The Election Commission said on Friday that polls for Maharashtra’s legislative council seats will be held on May 21, clearing the way for a process crucial to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s position since he has to become a member of either houses of the legislature by May 27 to remain in power.Polls for the council – the upper house that is elected by members of the legislative assembly – were initially set to be held in April but were pushed back due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak, which has triggered a near-complete ban on the movement of people. The government announced on Friday that some people will be allowed to move between 7am and 7pm from the next week.This will be the first election for the CM, who heads the Shiv Sena. The decision for him to head the government was taken after elections results on October 24 threw up a split verdict, which led the Shiv Sena to ally with rivals Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Congress in a coalition that has been named the Mharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA). According to India’s constitution, a minister needs to be elected to a legislature within six months of taking oath in the government. “In terms of the numbers, the MVA has them. The nine seats to the council are to be elected by 288 members of the assembly. The voting is done by preferential vote method and as per a formula adopted for these elections, roughly 29 votes are needed to elect one member. Based on the strength in assembly, BJP would get four seats, Sena and NCP would get two seats each, while the Congress party would get one,” a Sena functionary said, asking not to be named. He added that the paperwork for nomination has been initiated.The notification for the election will be issued on May 4. According to the schedule, the last day to file nominations is May 11, polling will be held on May 21, and counting of votes would be done on the same day.Shiv Sena leader and Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Raut called the decision the victory of “truth and justice”. He also thanked the Centre and EC for the decision which, he said, “saved” the state from a political crisis.“I, on behalf of Shiv Sena, thank the Centre and the EC because this decision has put a stop to the atmosphere of uncertainty in Maharashtra. There were unfounded fears that if Uddhav Thackeray is not elected to the House, he would have to resign; the government would collapse, President’s Rule will be imposed. The government under Thackeray was never going to collapse,” he said.MVA partner Nationalist Congress Party also welcomed the decision. Without naming opposition leaders, Maharashtra NCP president Jayant Patil said attempts by them to get “a backdoor entry” vanished with the EC’s decision. “Many people were hoping that the government would become unstable and they could attempt [to get back in power]. But the declaration of the election has answered all their questions,” said Patil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/9-maharashtra-seats-to-go-to-polls-on-may-21/story-MHum0CPPgSawJIhYoGa6RL.html

CCTV footage showed a man with a bag sat on some crates in the area prior to the fire.The Leicestershire police said: “The man was then seen to crouch over before standing up and walking off - noticing a flame coming from where he had been as he left. The fire was then seen to ignite on the CCTV and the man left the area”.The image of the suspect was issued in a public appeal and through leaflets which were handed out in the area asking for information.

02-05-2020||Chandigarh||State found wanting in testing: Only 876 reports of Nanded returnees in 5 days||Contrary to Punjab government’s claims on increasing its testing capacity to between 1,600 and 1,800 samples a day for Covid-19, the state health department has got results of a mere 876 high-risk Nanded returnees to date. Over the past five days, since these persons started arriving from April 26, the state has taken 3,443 samples of these persons and 240 have been found positive. The total number of persons who have returned from Nanded is 4,060. The figures are from a state media bulletin released at 7pm on Friday that puts the total number of positive cases at 585. A careful perusal of the media bulletin also confirms that the testing is lower than the government claims. On Friday, the department took 1,971 samples, but the pendency of reports showed an increase of 930 to 4,369 samples from 3,439 in Thursday’s 7pm figure. The total number of tests conducted till Thursday was 21,205. A senior government functionary involved in Covid-19 management admitted that on average only 1,000-1,100 tests had been carried out over the past three days. Punjab health Minister Balbir Sidhu said the sudden arrival of Punjabis from outside the state could be the reason behind delay in testing. “We have adequate testing capacity and test are also being done in already earmarked containment zones.” The state government has testing facilities at Government Medical Colleges in Patiala, Amritsar and Faridkot and in DMC Ludhiana. Samples from Punjab are also being sent to PGIMER, Chandigarh, and the Institute of Microbial Technology (IMTECH), Chandigarh. The health department also roped in a private player ‘Lal Path Labs’ to collect samples in Fazilka district. Over 11,000 have returned in 5 daysFigures with health department reveal that more than 11,000 Punjab natives have entered Punjab over the past five days. In addition to around 4,000 Nanded-returnees, the figure includes 7,000 from other states, and 732 from Rajasthan, including 150 students from the coaching hub of Kota.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/state-found-wanting-in-testing-only-876-reports-of-nanded-returnees-in-5-days/story-KeU559t1ZvsMzqAQzjGGMN.html

02-05-2020||Mumbai||Nanavati hospital under BMC radar following plaints of overcharging patients||Nanavati Hospital, one of the major hospitals dedicated to Covid-19 treatment in the city, is overcharging patients, said patients’ rights activists in a complaint to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). While the hospital has denied the allegations, BMC officials are set to inspect the hospital on Saturday. BMC health officials have received several complaints regarding the matter. Bills issued by the hospital, made available to HT, show several discrepancies, including charging over ₹8,000 for one unit of personal protective equipment (PPE). Activists have highlighted the case of a 31-year-old man who got admitted at the hospital on April 11 after testing positive. He was first admitted to the general ward and was shifted to the intensive care unit (ICU) on April 13. When he was discharged on April 15 the hospital bill amounted to ₹2,39,379; of which ₹66,699 was for medicines and ₹67,400 was for Covid care. As per the bill, which is available with HT, the hospital has charged him ₹8,900 for each unit of PPE.“There is no fixed rate for PPE at the hospital. For some patients, they charge ₹6,500 while for others it goes up to ₹9,500 per unit. The hospital, however, is procuring the same for only ₹750 each unit,” said Jitendra Janawale, a local politician who has filed a complaint against the hospital with BMC.Vishwas Mote, municipal ward officer, said, “We have received the complaints, and will conduct an inspection on Saturday. As it was a public holiday today, we had to postpone it.”In another case, a 60-year-old male patient from Versova, who was admitted at the hospital on April 8, was charged ₹5,51,607.A 69-year-old Covid positive woman, who has a medical history of Parkinson’s Disease, was admitted at the hospital on April 7 and was discharged on Friday with a bill of ₹6,97,756. Her daughters said while shifting the patient from Wockhardt Hospital, which closed after cases of Covid-19 among medical staff, to Nanavati Hospital, the hospital asked for a deposit of ₹50,000. The daughters further said, “My mother was in ICU but was kept only on oxygen support. I don’t know how the bill shot up so much. We had to take help from my cousin to pay the bill amount. The government needs to provide concession to elderly patients.” Health advocates have criticised the hospital for making unreasonable claims. According to the bills, the hospital is charging ₹2,000 per day as staff management charges, and ₹800 for Covid-biomedical waste disposal. It is also claiming ₹1,000 as nursing charge, ₹2,000 for resident medical officers and ₹2,600 for Covid consultations per day. Dr Abhijit More who works with Jan Aarogya Abhiyan said, “PPE is used for several patients in Covid wards, but hospitals do not split the bills and charge patients individually. Same with waste disposal system, the staff use the same gloves and bio waste bags. Patients are responsible for paying for their treatment, not for staff management.”The hospital has also been pulled up for not providing adequate safety gears to staffers with 26 employees contracting the infection. Kirit Somaiya, a politician, has written a letter to BMC commissioner Praveen Pardeshi seeking action against the hospital. “The hospital is not only looting patients but is also being negligent about the care of the patients. They are discharging in-house staff within five days, while outside patients are kept for 10-12 days,” he said. Manpreet Sohal, chief operating officer (COO) of the hospital, has denied the allegations. He said, “We have already submitted our clarifications to BMC and are coordinating with them.” The hospital has refused to make any comment on the email sent by HT. However, a source from the hospital said though the bill mentions ‘one quantity of PPE’, it represents per day usage of PPE.Despite repeated calls, Pardeshi didn’t respond.Meanwhile, the Supreme Court has issued a notice to the Central government after hearing a petition seeking regulation of Covid-19 treatment costs across private and corporate hospitals in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/nanavati-hospital-under-bmc-radar-following-plaints-of-overcharging-patients/story-QeEJ2dIzPlbQin5ykHboRP.html
02-05-2020||City||Cop made to wait for four hours for admission; hospital denies claims||A 57-year-old Mumbai Police personnel, who has tested positive for Covid-19, was allegedly first denied admission at Fortis Hospital, Vashi and was asked to pay ₹2 lakh to get him admitted. However, the personnel was admitted at the hospital after four hours following intervention and authorisation from municipal commissioners of Navi Mumbai and Panvel.The assistant sub-inspector (ASI), posted with the Protection Branch of the Mumbai Police, tested positive for Covid-19 on Thursday. Since he lives in Kamothe, senior police officers asked him to get admitted at Fortis Hospital in Vashi. Another policeman, who accompanied the ASI to help with admission formalities, said, “The hospital refused to admit him citing jurisdiction issues, and asked me to take him to either a private hospital in Ghansoli or DY Patil Hospital in Nerul.” He also added the hospital administration had asked the ASI’s daughter, a pharmacist, to pay ₹2 lakh. The hospital, however, denied the claim.When the policeman relayed the issue to his seniors in Mumbai, a team from Vashi police station was sent to request the hospital staff to allow admission. “The hospital staff, however, refused to budge and only agreed when the Navi Mumbai municipal commissioner (Annasaheb Misal) asked them to allow admission,” the officer said.The ASI was finally admitted at Fortis Hospital around 1am following a payment of ₹20,000 as hospital charges.Misal, however, said the hospital was following the guidelines to get him admitted in his corporation jurisdiction. “As per government guidelines, every corporation must set up a Covid-19 treatment facility, hence they (Fortis Hospital) asked the policeman to get admitted in a hospital in their (Panvel municipal) corporation. But since he was a police officer, we have allowed him to be admitted last night,” said Misal.Misal also added that 25 beds have been reserved for police personnel at DY Patil Hospital for Covid-19 treatment.The hospital in its statement said it was following the guidelines issued by the governing bodies about admitting Covid-19 patients. It further added that if a person from another municipal corporation wants to get admitted, there has to be separate authorisation, following which the patient can be admitted. “Claims about the hospital demanding ₹2 lakh for admission are completely baseless. The patient was admitted under MPKAY (Maharashtra Police Kutumb Arogya Yojana) scheme. The patient had to wait for approval from the authorities, and not because of financial commitment,” the statement issued by the Fortis Hospital read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cop-made-to-wait-for-four-hours-for-admission-hospital-denies-claims/story-SHCicPbwOvDiGESEe0j9OO.html

02-05-2020||Mumbai||VIDC scam: ED starts probe under PMLA||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has begun a money laundering probe based on some FIRs filed in the Vidarbha Irrigation Development Corporation (VIDC) scam, popularly referred as the irrigation scam.Maharashtra’s anti-corruption bureau (ACB) has cleared deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar of the allegations in connection with the irrigation scam, according to an affidavit filed in the Bombay high court (HC) late last year.Sources said ED has recently filed cases under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) and are probing few FIRs linked to the scam. The irrigation scam involves 44 projects spread over Vidarbha and Konkan, and the probe has so far led to 24 FIRs and 5 charge sheets.The scam was one of the political issues in the run-up to the 2014 state elections. Shortly after his victory, former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis opened the case against Pawar.The ACB had earlier accused Pawar, who was the irrigation minister between 1999 and 2009, of presiding over a regime in which “procedures were bypassed, pecuniary benefits were passed on, sub-standard work was allowed, leading to drain upon public exchequer”. However, in recent affidavits, the ACB has given him a clean chit saying he had no role in the cost upgradation or the mobilisation of advance. ACB had further said there was no evidence of money trail linking Pawar and suggested that the scam was a result of procedural irregularities, departmental lapses and deviations for which the minister could not be held responsible.The irrigation scam came to the fore in 2012 wherein it was revealed that even after spending ₹42,500 crore for a decade, the state had brought only 0.1% of the targeted land under irrigation. It was revealed that a nexus of contractors, officials and politicians had milked thousands of crores meant for irrigation projects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/vidc-scam-ed-starts-probe-under-pmla/story-O9UtwXCCbkDOG2MWV9DzgN.html
02-05-2020||Chandigarh||Claiming Central bias, Cong workers raise national flag on roof-tops||Punjab Congress’ call to protest against the Centre’s alleged discrimination with non-BJP ruled states in allocation of resources for fighting the covid-19 pandemic received a mixed response on Friday. The Congress had said people should protest by raising a national flag on their roof-tops. In Bathinda, finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal led the protest by raising the Tricolour at his office. Manpreet said, “To date, Punjab has received only Rs 71 crore to fight the pandemic. All other money received was already due to the state and we were entitled to it, even if there was no outbreak of the disease.” In Ludhiana, public participation remained low with local Congress leadership staging a protest near the statue of BR Ambedkar on the Jalandhar bypass. In Amritsar, the Congress rank and file, including state ministers, the MP, MLAs, and councillors raised the flags on rooftops. In Jalandhar, party MP Santokh Singh, along with MLAs Pargat Singh, Hardev Singh Laddi, Bawa Henry, Rajinder Beri and others unfurled the Tricolour at the local Congress office to express solidarity with all covid warriors and to honour the sacrifices of workers on the Labour Day.Tewari, Sidhu call for Centre to release GSTMohali/Rupnagar Party workers also protested against the Central government in Mohali, seeking the release of the state’s arrears of GST of around Rs 4,000 crore. State cabinet minister Balbir Singh Sidhu, who led these protests, also demanded the release of a grant from the Centre to contain covid-19. Anandpur Sahib MP Manish Tewari, who held a meeting, via video-conference, with party workers, MLAs, market committee members etc, also demanded that the Centre should release GST arrears of the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/claiming-central-bias-cong-workers-raise-national-flag-on-roof-tops/story-U1TqsZe1bHfy32uJafjSfI.html
02-05-2020||Chandigarh||Easing of restrictions in Chandigarh depends on lifting of containment order||The Central government on Friday extended the countrywide lockdown from May 4 to May 17 to prevent the spread of Covid-19, easing restrictions according to red, orange and green zones, but how Chandigarh fares depends on whether the administration lifts its containment order of April 18.The home affairs ministry’s Friday order extending the lockdown said no restrictions will be lifted in the containment zone except for essential and emergency services, but some restrictions will be eased in red zones outside such areas.“We will be following the Central government directions on relaxations to be introduced. A number of relaxations have been allowed in the red zones outside the containment zone by the latest ministry of home affairs order,” UT adviser Manoj Parida said.Consequently, the administration is actively considering limiting the containment zone to a few affected pockets rather than the entire city, he added. The administration is also likely to revoke the city-wide curfew and continue with the lockdown.“The final decision on the extent of containment zone and relaxations will be taken by May 3. Nearly 70% of suggestions from city residents and different stakeholders to the Sinha Committee have advocated relaxations to be introduced and containment zone to be demarcated,” Parida said.The adviser-appointed committee, led by AK Sinha, has been set up to recommend the post May 3 relaxation plan for the city.The city was declared a containment zone by the administration after the Central government designated it a red zone on April 15. Curfew orders imposed here on March 24.Covid-19 positive cases have also surged sharply from 27 to 88 in the last six days between April 25 and May 1. Administration has so far declared six ‘affected pockets’ in the city. 60% of city’s cases are from two pockets – Bapu Dham Colony and Sector 30. Mohali’s Nayagaon and Jawaharpur and Panchkula’s Sector 15 have been declared containment zones even as Chandigarh’s sister cities were designated orange zones. The administrations of Panchkula and Chandigarh are yet to issue orders after the lockdown extension even as Mohali has allowed several relaxations.BOXWHAT’S ALLOWED, WHAT’S NOTWhile Chandigarh remains in red zone, the satellite cities of Mohali and Panchkula have been demarcated as orange zonesRESTRICTIONS WITHIN CONTAINMENT ZONENo economic activity such as industries and commercial establishmentsEven neighbourhood shops can open only during curfew relaxationNo unchecked influx of populationActive search for cases through house-to-house surveillance by special teamsAll people must install Aarogya Setu mobile applicationRELAXATIONS OUTSIDE CONTAINMENT ZONE RED ZONEMovement of individuals and vehicles, only for permitted activitiesIndustrial establishments in urban areas, manufacturing units of essential goodsConstruction activities limited to in-situ and renewable energy projectsAll standalone, neighborhood shops permitted, without any distinction of essential and non-essential, including liquor vends, but excluding barber shops, spas and saloonsE-commerce activities permitted in respect to essential goodsPrivate offices can operate with up to 33% strengthORANGE ZONEIn addition to activities permitted in Red Zone, taxis and cab aggregators will be permitted with one driver and one passenger onlyInter-district movement of individuals and vehicles will be allowed for permitted activities onlyFour-wheeler vehicles will have maximum two passengers besides the driver and pillion riding will be allowed on two-wheelers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/easing-of-restrictions-in-chandigarh-depends-on-lifting-of-containment-order/story-airoHMaGhmJjXIkw2D6JDO.html

The Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC), on Wednesday, had sent 70 MSRTC buses from Dhule in Maharashtra to Kota to get students back. The parents of students were permitted to pick students up from Mumbai Central. These students will now be put in home quarantine for the next two weeks.According to state transport minister Anil Parab, 1,780 students from Maharashtra were stranded in colleges and coaching institutes in Kota, Rajasthan, during the lockdown. Students in Kota boarded buses that left Kota on Thursday night and Friday afternoon. Some districts, like Raigad and Beed, also sent privately-run buses.“Some buses arranged by the Maharashtra government left from Kota on Thursday night and reached Shirpur [in Dhule district] on Friday morning. From there, students were divided into separate buses based on their destination city,” said activist Sudha Shenoy who is also a parent of a medical student. As many as 1.5 lakh students join coaching institutes in Kota every year. “Most state governments started bringing back students stuck in Kota in April itself. We are glad the Maharashtra government woke up to this now our kids are back home safe and sound,” said Roshan Jaiswal, another parent.With the ongoing lockdown, there is little clarity regarding the status of engineering and medical entrance exams this year.

02-05-2020||Mumbai||Yes Bank fraud: Court extends CBI custody of Wadhawans till May 8||A Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) court, on Friday, extended the custody of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Limited (DHFL) promoters Kapil and Dheeraj Wadhawan, who were arrested in connection with Yes Bank fraud case, till May 8. CBI had arrested the brothers on April 26 and the duo has been in custody since then. CBI will also be probing 150 shell companies which are said to be under the control of Wadhawan brothers.CBI in its FIR against the Wadhawan brothers had alleged that Yes Bank had invested ₹3,700 crore in short-term debentures in DHFL, which has not been redeemed till date, for which the Wadhawans had paid a kickback of ₹600 crore to Rana Kapoor, former chief executive officer and managing director of Yes Bank, in the form of a loan to DoIT Urban Ventures (India) Pvt Ltd – a company registered in the name of Kapoor’s daughters.CBI officials produced the Wadhawan brothers before the court and sought further custody for a period of seven days claiming that they needed to probe the role of other directors in DHFL along with other Yes Bank officials. It also contended that custody is required to find out details about more than 150 shell companies being controlled by the duo. The agency also said they need to probe their email accounts to get more details on the conspiracy.The agency is looking at the role played by the other accused in the fraud, and are investigating if any kickbacks were received by DHFL or Yes Bank employees. These employees will be asked to join the probe once the lockdown is lifted, said CBI sources. The court after considering the seriousness of the case extended the CBI custody of the two brothers till May 8 to facilitate CBI in further investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/yes-bank-fraud-court-extends-cbi-custody-of-wadhawans-till-may-8/story-CvGoQboP17FM2ZBxUFwteL.html
02-05-2020||City||Respite for Uddhav as EC to hold polls for 9 Council seats on May 21||The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Friday said it will hold elections for the nine vacant seats in the Maharashtra Legislative Council, the upper house of the state legislature, on May 21, paving the way for chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to enter the legislature as a member. Thackeray needs to be elected from one of the nine seats by May 27 to retain his post at the helm of the state. Shiv Sena and its partners in the ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) coalition welcomed the decision.Friday’s development ends a period of uncertainty following the deferring of polls on April 3, owing to the coronavirus outbreak. The seats have been lying vacant since April 24. The 288-members of the Maharashtra Assembly will vote to elect the members to the upper house. “Elections to the posts of nine members of legislative council (MLCs) have been cleared,” a senior poll official told HT. “The commission has decided to hold the election on May 21. Normally, the counting is done on the same day. The results will also be declared then,” a second official added.Sena leaders are now trying to ensure that the election is held without any hindrance and unanimously. A Sena functionary said that it would be a “smooth” election for Thackeray, who would be the second to contest an election from the Thackeray clan after his son, Aaditya, who contested the Assembly elections.“In terms of numbers, the MVA has them. The nine seats to the council are to be elected by 288 members of the Assembly. The voting is done by preferential vote method and as per a formula adopted for these elections, roughly 29 votes are needed to elect one member. Based on the strength in the Assembly, BJP would get four seats, Sena and ally Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) would get two seats each, while the Congress would get one,” a Sena functionary said. He added that the paperwork for nomination has been initiated. The notification for the election will be issued on May 4. According to the schedule, the last day for nominations is May 11. Polling will be held on May 21, and the counting would be done on the same day.Sena leader and Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Raut called the decision the victory of “truth and justice”. Raut also thanked the Centre and EC for the decision, which “saved” the state from a political crisis.Calling it an “excellent” decision, Raut said, “I, on behalf of Shiv Sena, thank the Central government and the EC because this decision has put a stop to the atmosphere of uncertainty in Maharashtra. There were unfounded fears that if Thackeray is not elected to the House he would have to resign; the government would collapse, President’s Rule will be imposed. Many theories were floated, which caused fear in the minds of the people. The state government under chief minister Uddhav Thackeray was never going to collapse. It was thought that some technical and constitutional tangle would be created. The Central government and Election Commission has saved a big state like Maharashtra from going in the direction of a crisis.”The NCP also welcomed the decision. Without naming Opposition party leaders, Maharashtra NCP president Jayant Patil said that attempts by them to get a backdoor entry vanished with the EC’s decision. “The state cabinet had recommended Uddhav Thackeray’s name to the governor twice, but no decision was taken. Subsequently, the three parties wrote to the EC, requesting it to hold polls on the nine seats as there is a chance of uncertainty in the state. Our request has been accepted by the EC. Many people were hoping that the government would become unstable and they could attempt [to get back in power]. But the declaration of the election has answered all their questions,” said Patil.There is an apprehension among the ruling coalition that there could be an attempt to. create a legal hindrance in the legislative council election. However, a Sena leader said, “There is a Supreme Court ruling that once elections are declared it cannot be stayed. So if there is any plan of foul play, it is not going to work.”In his address to the people on social media on Friday afternoon, Thackeray said: “If someone loves us, we reciprocate but if betrayed, we show them their place.”Raut added that they hope that the issue would not be politicised at a time when the state is battling the Covid-19 outbreak. “We are of the opinion that nobody should do politics at a time when Maharashtra is fighting a huge battle against the coronavirus and nowhere attempts should be made through political intervention. This is a time when the government and the opposition should work together for the people of the state. The people are expecting things from the opposition as well,” he said.The ruling party is looking at making attempts to fill the vacant seats unopposed. In the past, there have been instances when political parties have ensured that the Rajya Sabha or Council seats are filled unanimously to avoid horse-trading. “We will see if the election on all nine seats can be held unopposed, considering the current coronavirus crisis. It would be an example for the rest of the country. Let’s see, nothing can be said if it would happen as of now,” he said.On Thursday, Maharashtra governor B Koshyari had asked the Commission to hold the polls “at the earliest”. In a letter issued by Raj Bhavan, the governor said that elections to the vacant seats will help end the “uncertainty” prevailing in the state. The seats have been lying vacant since April 24. The governor urged the EC to take note of the fact that the Centre had allowed for various relaxations in the second phase of the lockdown. “As such the elections to the Council seats can be held with certain guidelines,” Koshyari said in his letter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/respite-for-uddhav-as-ec-to-hold-polls-for-9-council-seats-on-may-21/story-WF4UPrXXKxtcySgEtegIRN.html
02-05-2020||Mumbai||Maha reports highest one-day spike with 1,008 Covid cases||In a first, Maharashtra recorded more than 1,000 coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in a day with 1,008 new infections on Friday, taking the number of patients in India’s most ravaged state to 11,506, even as the government announced relaxing lockdown restrictions in some districts. The country’s worst-hit city, Mumbai, too, recorded its highest single-day jump of cases with 751 new infections, increasing the tally to 7,812. However, of the 751 patients, 399 are those who tested positive in private labs across the city between April 25 and April 28.Maharashtra also recorded 26 deaths, taking the toll up to 485. On Friday, Mumbai recorded five deaths, taking its toll to 295, while ten were reported in Pune, three in Jalgaon and one each in Pune rural, Sindhudurg, Bhiwandi, Thane, Nanded, Aurangbad and Parbhani. One death of an Uttar Pradesh resident was recorded in Mumbai. Of the deaths, 14 of them were above 60, while 11 were between 40 and 59 years of age. Fifteen of the patients had high risk comorbidities, the health department said.In 24 hours, the state carried out 7,327 coronavirus tests, 13.75% of which turned positive. The state has conducted 1,53,125 tests so far.On Friday, which was Maharashtra Day, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, in his address through Facebook Live, said the lockdown in the state would be lifted gradually after May 3, when the second phase of the national lockdown ends. However, restrictions will not be lifted in Mumbai and its surrounding areas, along with Pune and its surrounding areas, as they fall under the red zone. Comparing the red zone areas to an active volcano, Thackeray said that lifting restrictions is “not in our interest”.“The red zone is like an active volcano, orange zone is like a dormant volcano, and the green zone is where the volcano will not erupt. Naturally, Mumbai, Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), Pune, Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR), Nagpur and Aurangabad fall in the red zone as cases are increasing daily. Here, to start something is not in our interest. In orange zones, there are a few active cases in some areas; we are looking at lifting restrictions, leaving aside areas where there are more cases. In the green zone, we have already started lifting restrictions gradually.” He outlined that lifting of restrictions will be done “cautiously”.“Some restrictions will be eased after May 3, based on the zones. But, there must be no haste, while doing so. I know everyone has pending works to attend to. At the same time, we must take cautious steps to ensure the infections do not flare up again and the present gains are not lost, while normalcy is being restored. Normal life has to be restored carefully,” Thackeray said.Maharashtra has six districts in the green zone. Gadchiroli and Wardha have no Covid-19 patients, while Gondia has not reported any new case in the past 35 days. Osmanabad has three cases, while Sindhudurg and Washim have two cases each.Sixteen districts (Raigad, Ahmednagar, Amravati, Buldhana, Nandurbar, Kolhapur, Hingoli, Ratnagiri, Jalna, Nanded, Chandrapur, Sangli, Latur, Parbhani, Bhandara and Beed) have less number of cases in their rural parts — in single digits. Some of them have not recorded any new patients in the past 14 days. The state government may continue with the lockdown restrictions only in the urban areas. According to state officials, some of the districts (like Chandrapur) from the list can be shifted to the green district list. “The state governments have been given powers to do so by the Centre,” the officer said.The Centre has put 14 Maharashtra districts in the red zone. The state government wants the lockdown to be strictly implemented in some of these districts, including Mumbai, Mumbai suburbs, Pune, Thane, Palghar, Nashik, Nagpur, Solapur, Aurangabad until May 17. However, in the remaining districts — Yavatmal, Satara, Dhule, Akola and Jalgaon — the restrictions can be partially relaxed, according to government officials.Of the 1,53,125 tests across 45 laboratories in the state, 14,0587 of them were negative. 1,63,026 people are currently under home quarantine, while 11,677 are under institutional quarantine. A total of 10,849 teams of health workers have screened 45.34 lakh people for suspected infections after having come in contact with positive patients. A total of 1,879 patients have fully recovered from various hospitals in the past six weeks.“We can tighten the restrictions imposed by the Centre, but cannot relax them. Our notification, however, can exclude rural areas as has been allowed in the Central notification,” the official said.Health minister Rajesh Tope said that the state government will issue its notification before May 3 on the lines of an extended lockdown and the relaxations in green and orange zones. “There will be no restrictions for the activities within districts in green-tag districts, while in orange districts, too, large-scale relaxation can be given, barring hotspots. We are also thinking about relaxations to some extent in big cities like Mumbai, Thane, Pune, Nagpur, barring containment zones. A detailed notification will soon be issued,” he said.State transport minister Anil Parab said, “The railways ministry has informed us about the arrangement of special trains for migrant workers stuck in the state. We have started registering the workers who want to go back to their respective states. Each of the trains will have a capacity for 1,000 passengers, who will be allowed only after medical certifications. The migrants will be allowed to board trains only after getting no-objection certificates from receiving states.”Those who want to travel within the state will have to form groups of 25 passengers. “The groups will be allowed to travel after they comply with formalities and furnish health certificates. However, the people from MMR, Pune, Pimpri-Chinchwad and Nagpur will not be allowed to travel under these relaxed norms,” he said.Meanwhile, the state government revised its notification issued on Thursday for migrants, pilgrims, students and other people who are stuck and want to travel intra-state and inter-state. The powers to approve the travel plan have now been given to the police commissioners in cities and collectors in rural areas. It has been clarified that strict restrictions for moving out of the red-zone districts will remain intact.Tope said that the state’s recovery rate has improved to 20% (from 14.91% on Tuesday), while mortality rate has dropped to 3.5% from (7.41% on April 12). “Our doubling rate is better than that of national rate and the state has the distinction of highest tests (over 1.50 lakh) through 45 labs, including 20 private labs. We are also started use of portable pulse oxymeters for speedy diagnostics and for better recovery rate. We are focusing on senior citizens and people with comorbidities, so that they are quarantined institutionally if the need be,” he said.While talking about the bed facilities in Mumbai, the minister said that an additional facility of 2,000 beds at Worli, Powai and Goregaon has been created and if the need arises, the schools and colleges too can be utilised for the same. Tope also announced to extend the government mediclaim scheme –Mahatma Phule Janarogya Yojana — to all the citizens in the state for free treatment at Covid and non-Covid hospitals. “Maharashtra is the only state to extend free health services to all its citizens. We have also taken cognisance of the complaints of overcharging and profiteering by some private hospitals in Mumbai and Pune. The private hospitals will not be able to charge more than the rates ascertained by the General Insurance Public Sector Association, irrespective of the class of services given to the patients. In rest of the state, the rate card finalised under a third-party agreement will have to be followed,” he said.CM Thackeray added that the lockdown had helped arrest the spread of the coronavirus. He said that the “speed-breakers” has helped contain the spread, which would have been exponential had the lockdown not been imposed. “Many feel cases have increased despite the lockdown. I would call the lockdown a speed-breaker. The Singapore PM termed it a circuit-breaker, which breaks the transmission chain. The lockdown helped to break this transmission chain or else the virus would have multiplied much faster than what we can imagine. Still, the numbers are rising because of the contacts of patients who were infected initially,” he said.He said that 75% to 80% of the Covid-19 cases in the state do not show any symptoms or show mild symptoms of the disease.Outlining the work done by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), Thackeray said that in the past few days, the civic body has screened two lakh people in the slums for low oxygen levels and other diseases, including diabetes, high blood pressure, etc. Such people are vulnerable to the coronavirus.“In Mumbai, 272 people have been found with low oxygen levels and other ailments. BMC is not only providing oxygen, but doctors are treating their other ailments,” he said.Thackeray said that besides ramping up the capacity of beds in the state, doctors and nursing staff have been inducted. He said he has received responses from 10,000 people, including from doctors, nurses, etc, to volunteer in the fight against coronavirus. “I am very proud to note that after my appeal to ‘COVID Yoddhas,’ thousands came forward. Over 20,000 expressed their desire, around 10,000 said they were actually ready to work and some are being trained. It is not as if we are only increasing the number of beds sans any doctors. Doctors and nursing staff are also being trained,” he said.The Central and Western Railway will operate outstation trains for movement of migrant workers only on the demand of the state government. The Maharashtra government had requested the railways to operate trains for migrant workers, from Nashik to Lucknow and Nashik to Bhopal.According to railway officials, the state government has to get permission from other state governments in order to facilitate movement of workers. The Maharashtra government reportedly did not get permission for the operation of a train towards Lucknow. The railways will operate a train from Nashik to Bhopal. The railway ministry on Friday evening further extended cancellation of all passenger trains, including local trains, till May 17||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maha-reports-highest-one-day-spike-with-1-008-covid-cases/story-Q2gTDh5uE5tEVVhKJ1HMSP.html
02-05-2020||Mumbai||IIT-Bombay reports first Covid-19 case on campus after staffer’s health worker wife tests positive||The first case of Covid-19 at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT-B) was reported on Thursday after the wife of a staffer tested positive for the virus.According to the institute authorities, the infected woman worked as a health worker at a government hospital in south Mumbai and had likely contracted the virus from a Covid-19 patient. Her husband, who is an employee of IIT-B, and their two children, have been quarantined in a separate facility on campus.“The woman is a health worker at a hospital and her husband works at our institute. They lived on campus. Once she tested positive, she was moved to a hospital and her family was quarantined in a special area on campus. She is doing fine and is undergoing treatment,” said institute director Subhasis Chadhuri. Officials of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) visited the campus on Friday and standard operating procedures were followed.“On our part, we have sanitised some of the common areas such as the lift and lobby of the building the patient was residing in. Neighbours have been asked to follow BMC directives for quarantine. We will cooperate with the state authorities on the matter,” said Chaudhuri.Chaudhuri has also urged residents not to panic. “Although there is nothing to panic about as yet, we hope there are no more positive cases on campus,” he said. All academic and research activities remain suspended on campus since mid-March and early summer vacation has been announced. Students were asked to vacate the campus in the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak and summer vacations will end on May 31. Four buildings at the IIT-B campus were earlier converted into quarantine facilities for asymptomatic flyers coming into the city from different international destinations, following the collector’s orders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/iit-bombay-reports-first-covid-19-case-on-campus-after-staffer-s-health-worker-wife-tests-positive/story-Ae2qDR2m0ak70NJxdBmoRN.html
02-05-2020||Mumbai||Coronavirus cases rising, but recovery rate surges to 16% in Mumbai and Maharashtra||Despite the drastic surge in the total number of coronavirus cases in the city and the state in the past 15 days, the number of patients who have recovered has more than doubled from 205 on April 16 to 1,180 on April 30, data by the state health department has revealed. In the state, 1,773 patients have been cured until April 30, as compared to the 300 patients who had recovered until April 16. The recovery rate in the state and Mumbai stands at 16% on April 30, a surge from 9% recorded on April 16.HT asked Dr Pradeep Awate, Maharashtra’s disease surveillance officer, if the surge in the number of recoveries is owing to any change in discharge policy of patients which is leading to the surge in recoveries. He said, “There is no change in our discharge policy. We are discharging patients only after 14 days of admission, provided their two consecutive tests come negative. Also, with the total number of cases increasing, the recovery rate is also bound to go up.”However, two corporations – Solapur and Panvel – which have recorded 92 and 47 cases respectively – has not recorded even a single case of recovery.According to the health department, the surge in the number of recoveries in Mumbai began from April 22, when the city had 483 cured, even as the total number of cases was 3,683. On April 26, Mumbai recorded 728 recoveries for 5,407 until then. The number of cured patients surged to 885 on April 28 when the city had 6,169 cases.On April 29, the recovery count crossed the 1,000-mark after 1,024 patients had been recovered, even as the cases stood at 6,644.According to the state health department data, the recovery rate is highest in cities such as Mumbai and Pune, which also have the highest number of cases in the state. Of the total 1,773 patients who have recovered in Maharashtra, 1,395 are from Mumbai and Pune alone. However, in terms of recovery rate, smaller cities have been performing better than Mumbai and Pune. Thane for instance has recorded 28 recoveries (58%) until April 30 of the total 48 positive cases reported in the city. Likewise, Pimpri-Chinchwad has recorded around 50% recovery rate, with 34 of 72 patients recovering. Meanwhile, Nagpur has a recovery rate of 29 % with 39 patients of 133 patients having been cured. At Raigad district, of the 24 cases, 14 patients have recovered, while the Mira -Bhayandar district, which has seen 126 cases, recorded a recovery rate of 25%. Neighbouring Vasai-Virar district has witnessed a recovery rate of around 20%, with 26 of 128 patients having been cured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/coronavirus-cases-rising-but-recovery-rate-surges-to-16-in-mumbai-and-maharashtra/story-K0vH0DMJQEegfNoAtImfJI.html
02-05-2020||City||751 new coronavirus cases in Mumbai, 399 are from tests between April 25 and April 29||The city on Friday recorded 751 new cases, the highest in a single day so far, taking the total to 7,812, even as five more deaths brought the toll to 295. However, of the 751 new cases, 352 are patients whose tests results arrived on Friday, while 399 are patients who tested positive in private labs across the city between April 25 and April 28.The fatality rate in Mumbai is now 3.77%. Of the five deaths, two were above 60 years of age, one was below 40 years, and the other two were in the 40-60 age group. Three of the five had co-morbidities.The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation on Friday also issued an advisory for citizens not to panic, to remain in their homes and visit the nearest clinic, dispensary or Covid-19 Care Centre in case of fever, cough, or slight breathlessness. It also urged everyone not to stigmatise the patient or family which has tested positive. The BMC also announced that Covid-19 positive patients who are asymptomatic do not need to rush to major hospitals and wait for the health department’s guidance.So far, the BMC has spent ₹120 crore from its contingency fund for Covid-19 preparedness in hospitals, healthcare units, on food and personal protective equipment for the frontline staff. Mumbai now has 1,576 containment zones, up from 987 containment zones on April 24. Of them, 904 are either in slums, chawls, or congested buildings and areas, or buildings and localities that have common toilets.The BMC on Friday called for 100% attendance from its staff, to buff its resources to trace high- and low-risk contacts, manage and strengthen quarantine centres, and manage other logistics to contain the outbreak. However, the BMC has exempted staff members above the age of 55, and who have co-morbidities, from the ranks of Class 3 and 4, for the next 10 days. Senior officers, however, have to report to work even if they are above 55 years of age, but they will not be given any Covid-19 related work, the circular said. This order only applies to staff members working in non-essential services department, as those working in essential departments such as health, solid waste management and drinking water supply are already working at their usual capacity.Within the past few weeks, the BMC has floated tenders for at least three big-ticket infrastructure projects in Mumbai. This includes the ₹21,000-crore tenders floated to upgrade six sewage treatment plants, from the present facility of primary treatment to tertiary treatment of water. The plan has been stuck for more than five years.P Velarasu, additional municipal commissioner incharge of projects in BMC, said, “The tender cost includes maintenance cost for a period of 15 years since construction.”The BMC on Wednesday also floated ₹4,000-crore tenders for construction of twin tunnels for its ambitious Goregaon-Mulund Link Road (GMLR) project, which will run under Sanjay Gandhi National Park. These tenders include the design and build operations for the twin tunnels. A few weeks ago, the BMC floated tenders for the pumping stations and Mogra and Mahul.Leader of the Samajwadi Party in BMC and Bhiwandi MLA Rais Shaikh criticised the BMC for going about non-Covid business and said on social media, “In times when the entire state is concentrating and fighting the pandemic, BMC has had time to float STP tenders worth Rs 21,000 crores, by giving only one month period to bid. These tenders have been due for past two years. Wonder what is the hurry and who are they trying to accommodate?”In response, Velarasu said, “Only tender documents have been floated. The entire process takes up to five months to complete, and has only been initiated now. Newspapers are working, so contractors can view the tender documents and prepare their bids during this time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/751-new-coronavirus-cases-in-mumbai-399-are-from-tests-between-april-25-and-april-29/story-CwYgltGSEyvk5nWtQhZKPI.html

02-05-2020||City||Cases spike in Chandigarh, Mohali: Panchkula seals its border points||Cautious of the spurt in Covid-19 cases in Chandigarh and Mohali district, the Panchkula administration on Friday ordered complete sealing of its borders from Saturday, while restricting cross-border movement in a more stringent manner. Panchkula at present has just one active case, with 17 patients cured. All entry and exits points will be sealed from Saturday morning. In case of emergency, the commuter will be thermal screened before being let in. Rapid testing for symptomatic people entering Panchkula has been advised.Apart from this, commuters need to compulsorily download the Aarogaya Setu App.As per the order, people who need to travel to Panchkula for work have to be accommodated within their home districts by their employers. Panchkula residents working outside the district will also have to make similar arrangements with their managements.The four-page order issued by deputy commissioner Mukesh Ahuja said these steps were needed as the number of Covid-19 cases in Chandigarh and Mohali had climbed suddenly.Cases in areas bordering Panchkula remain a potential threat to residents in the district, it added.EXEMPTIONSAs per the order, authorised government officers and staff from the Punjab and Haryana high court and other courts, and government health professionals will be allowed movement.Those provided restricted movement passes by the governments of India, Haryana, Punjab and Chandigarh are exempted.Transit logistics movement on national highways or state highways for cargo/raw material/finished goods is allowed.

02-05-2020||Chandigarh||Delineating city into smaller containment zones on Chandigarh admn’s mind||Facing flak for declaring the entire city as a containment zone and with more than 60% coronavirus cases reported from only two residential pockets out of 100 so far, the UT administration is considering re-demarcating the containment zone after May 3.The modified criteria for delineating containment zones, announced by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) on Thursday, will ease the administration’s job of redrawing the boundaries of the smaller containment zones.UT adviser Manoj Kumar Parida, said, “We are thinking of smaller containment zones. Entire city cannot be sealed for months together. Industry, trade and service sector have to resume work with social distancing.”The city has been under curfew since March 24. It was designated a containment zone on April 18 after the central government declared it a hotspot (red zone) on April 15. On Thursday, the Centre retained the city under red zone after a sharp increase in positive cases.60% CASES FROM TWO AREASThere are 100 residential pockets in the city, including 57 sectors, 22 villages and 21 colonies. Of these, 19 pockets so far have reported coronavirus cases. But, only two pockets – Bapu Dham Colony and Sector 30 have contributed more than 60% of the cases. Bapu Dham has recorded 37 cases so far.Of particular concern for the administration are the colonies with 50% of the city’s total population of around 12 lakh. Several such colonies, including Bapu Dham Colony, Mauli Jagran, Ram Darbar, EWS Colony in sectors 30 and 38, Sector 52 Rehabilitation Colony and Dhanas, have already reported positive cases. Two – Bapu Dham and Dhanas Kachi Colony — have already been designated as ‘affected pockets’.NEW CRITERIA FOR CONTAINMENT ZONESAs per the modified criteria communicated by the health ministry to all states and union territories on Thursday, a residential colony/mohalla/municipal ward or police-station area/municipal zones/towns can be designated as containment zones in urban areas.The containment zones in these districts have to be delineated based on mapping and geographical dispersion of cases and contacts, area with well-demarcated perimeter and enforceability.“The area should be appropriately defined by the district administration/local urban body with technical inputs at the local level,” the communique said.WHY CONTAINMENT ZONE MATTERSNo economic activity - opening of industrial and commercial establishments - can take place in a containment zone.Not even neighbourhood shops, as allowed by the Ministry of Home Affairs, can be opened except during curfew relaxation.A containment operation is deemed to be over 28 days from the date the last case in the containment zone tests negative.All people in the containment zone must install Aarogya Setu mobile application, which informs user in case they have crossed paths with someone who has tested positive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/delineating-city-into-smaller-containment-zones-on-chandigarh-admn-s-mind/story-OAX7YhdIbqLUzAcY6hHgpM.html
02-05-2020||Chandigarh||4,000 enrol in Punjab to go home, 96,000 more expected in 48 hours||Around 4,000 stranded persons, mostly migrant workers, registered with the Punjab government on Friday stating they intend to return home. The registrations were done online after the state government started the exercise through ‘Cova App’, a central app for all covid-19 related information and management, to allow them to return to their home states. “The registration will remain open till May 3 and we expect another 96,000 to register in the next 48 hours,” said a senior officer. Lakhs of migrant labourers have been stranded in different parts of the state without work since the imposition of curfew on March 23.A large number of migrants in the state are from Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand. Another 1,000 persons have registered to return to Punjab from other states. Additional chief secretary, home, Satish Chandra also wrote to divisional railway managers (DRMs), Ambala and Ferozepur, on Friday for making arrangements for the movement of stranded persons, stating that over 1 lakh of them are expected to get themselves register by May 3. “As a pre-emptive measure, adequate arrangements must be made by the railways to create adequate facilities at Ludhiana, Jalandhar, Amritsar and Bathinda railway stations in order to ensure smooth travel,” he wrote, urging them to appoint nodal officers at each of these railway stations to monitor and coordinate the travel arrangements. “Once the registration is completed, the state government will intimate the exact number of railway stations and place with specific indents for passenger trains on a point-to-point basis. All necessary arrangement to ensure smooth movement of stranded persons, including issuance of medical certificates, security social distancing norms will be made by the district authorities,” Chandra added. Though the railways have also agreed to run special trains to take the stranded migrants, students and others home, the first such train is unlikely to leave the state before May 5.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/4-000-enrol-in-punjab-to-go-home-96-000-more-expected-in-48-hours/story-IJCjSctJcYyexyN0VBV2vK.html
02-05-2020||City||Curbs eased in Mohali, but residents remain indoors||Day 1 of curfew relaxation between 7 am and 11am on Friday saw Mohali residents preferring to continue to remain indoors amid the continuing threat of the coronavirus pandemic.The district administration has allowed all shops to remain open during the four hours in the urban areas, following which shops offering essential supplies, such as groceries, vegetables, milk, meat and medicines, can continue to deliver orders at home, only with requisite permissions. Further, shops will operate on rotational basis - those with even SCO/SCF/booth numbers will be open on even dates and those with odd numbers on odd dates.In rural areas, all shops, irrespective of shop number, can remain between 7am and 11am.A visit to Phases 3B2, 5, 7, 10 and 11 revealed only a few grocery, chemist and hardware shops open. In some places, shops selling non-essential products, like garments and cycles, were also open.Some shopkeepers claimed they were not sure whether or not to open their shops.“The idea is to give some respite to the public and shopkeepers after the curfew of five weeks. We had been getting requests to allow shops to reopen, so the relaxation was allowed. It was the first day today, more residents may reach out to shops in the coming days,” said deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan.All markets will remain completely closed on Sundays, he said, but, e-commerce orders and phone orders through local stores can be delivered.Shopkeepers in both rural and urban areas will have to ensure social distancing and all workers must wear masks and use hand sanitisers.Shops are not allowed to open in Jawaharpur village in Dera Bassi and Nayagaon, which have been declared hotspots.Any violation will invite criminal proceedings under the relevant provisions of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, and the Indian Penal Code.TRADERS SEEK CHANGE IN RELAXATION HOURSStating that 7am was too early for residents to step out, shopkeepers have sought the relaxation hours be changed to 9am to 1pm. Phase 3B2 Market Welfare Association president Jatinder Pal Singh said they had requested the authorities to change the timings, as no one will come to the markets at 7am. He said most shopkeepers were not aware of the relaxation notification, so it will take some days for their operations to streamline.MOHALI OUT OF RED ZONE NOWAssigned the red zone tag after sudden spurt in cases in April, Mohali has been moved to the orange zone in Centre’s revised list.While red zones comprise cities with major outbreaks, orange zones include places showing a decline in number of new cases. At present, Mohali has 92 patients of Covid-19, of which 30 have recovered and two have died. The district has two hotspots - Jawaharpur village in Dera Bassi and Nayagaon, with 46 and nine cases, respectively. Nayagaon has reported one Covid-19 death.POLICE DOWN SHUTTERS IN DERA BASSIIn Dera Bassi, shopkeepers complained that police did not allow them to open their shops, leading to confusion.Complaints poured in from shops on Lohgarh Road and in Shiva Enclave. The furniture market in Zirakpur also remained closed. Sunil Kumar Sethi, who runs a shop on Lohgarh Road, said when he had just opened the shop at 7am, police arrived and asked him to pull down the shutters. “The shops are allowed to open on odd-even basis. The market association have been asked to chalk out the plan,” said Kuldeep Bawa, SDM, Dera Bassi.

According to India Meteorological Department (IMD), the city saw 19.7 mm rain fall mainly in Shivajinagar, bringing the maximum temperature down to 38.3 degrees Celsius from 40 degrees Celsius which the city has been witnessing for the past three days.A mobile tower atop a residential building in Somawar peth came crashing down, with rain lashing out in the city followed by gusty winds (speed reaching 30-40 kmph). A hoarding fell near Sancheti Hospital on JM road, blocking roads leading to Shivajinaga. In Model colony, large trees fell damaging parked vehicles.A wall crumbled under pressure of a falling tree at Kasturi chowk and an old banyan tree fell outside Yerawada jail, said officials. According to an official from IMD, “The influence of the cyclonic circulation over south Andaman Sea has formed a low pressure area over south Andaman Sea and adjoining southeast Bay of Bengal. This associated cyclonic circulation extends up to 4.5 km above mean sea level. It is very likely to become more marked over the same region during next 48 hours, concentrate into a depression over Andaman Sea and adjoining southeast Bay of Bengal during subsequent 48 hours and likely to intensify further thereafter.” The city will continue to witness wind, thundery activity on 2 May too with the maximum temperature at 39 degree Celsius and minimum at 24 degree Celsius.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/wind-rain-damage-mobile-tower-atop-building-hoarding/story-C0m6rfMSmPOABFudmHBqAM.html

02-05-2020||Mumbai||Police to make list of migrant labourers, pilgrims, students stranded in the city||All stations under the Mumbai Police on Thursday started the exercise of updating the list of migrant labourers, pilgrims, pilgrims, tourists, students and other stranded people under their jurisdiction, excluding those who have tested positive for Covid 19, to send them back to their hometowns. However, police sources said, apart from creating a list there is no clarity on which mode of transport will be used. Police are also asking the stranded people if they have personal means of transport that can be used. Pranaya Ashok, DCP (operations) and Mumbai Police spokesperson did not respond to calls and messages. As testing is not possible, a mandatory screening will be done for all migrant labourers. They will also be asked to produce a certificate from a registered medical practitioner, stating they are not showing any symptom of the novel coronavirus disease. The procedure will take at least three to four days to complete, said police sources.Police have released an application form for migrants to fill in their name, Aadhaar details, mobile number, address and medical certificate. The list is being prepared under the guidance of 13 zonal deputy police commissioners (DCPs) in Mumbai Police. Each zonal DCP will forward the records to a nodal officer appointed by the collector’s office. The officer will verify them and send the reports back to the local DCP’s office. A police officer, posted in Malad (East) area, said, “We have been asked to get in touch with migrant labourers and make a list of them. We know about 850 migrant labourers live under our jurisdiction and are further updating our list. We are also verifying who is a migrant labourer and who is not.” Once the list with their details--name, age, village, state, mobile number, photo identity card and the medical certificate -- is collected, a police officer will conduct a verification process and update the zonal DCP with a list of such labourers. To ensure social distancing during the exercise, a senior police officer from the central region, which is worst hit by the virus, said they are taking details of only 25 labourers per day. “We have migrants in jurisdictions of every police station. A majority of them are settled in Nagpada, Wadala, Dharavi, Byculla, Sewri and Reay Road. Every police station has been assigned a job of gathering details of 25 migrants daily. The list will be submitted to the DCP of the zone. This will not result in any chaos,” he said. Crime branch asked to supplement forceAfter police personnel above 55 years of age were sent on leave along with officials suffering major ailments, the Mumbai Police commissioner on Thursday directed 15 units of the crime branch, including anti-extortion cell (AEC), criminal intelligence unit (CIU) and property cell to assist the local police stations in handing critical containment zones in their respective zones. Joint commissioner of police Santosh Rastogi confirmed that around 150 officials from the crime branch have been deployed for Covid 19 bandobast. “The crime branch officials were deployed for bandobast which require extra force,” said Rastogi. “The crime branch is an investigation agency and is ordinarily not deployed on such duties, but due to shortage of staff in the police stations, around 150 crime branch officials from all units were deployed in most affected areas under their zone,” said a senior official on condition of anonymity.

02-05-2020||Lucknow||Banthra slaying: Suspicion, greed lead killing of six||Suspicions of illicit relations of a sexagenarian father, greed for property, constant humiliation by a younger brother and the mother being a mute spectator to it all triggered the sensational killing of six members of a family, in a Banthra village, on Thursday evening.The six killed were identified as Amar Singh(68), Ram Sakkhi (65) his younger brother, Arun Singh (40) his wife, Ram Dulari (35) and their children – Saurabh( 9) and Sarika (2). The police arrested Amar Singh’s elder son, Ajay Singh (46) and his 19-year-old son, Avinash Singh, for executing the sensational killings.Krishna Nagar assistant commissioner of police (ACP) Deepak Kumar Singh, who was among the first responders to the incident, said it was a loathsome scene outside the house of Amar Singh in Guduali village of Banthara, when he reached the spot after getting information about the incident at around 7.30 pm.“Blood-soaked bodies of Ram Sakkhi, Arun, Ram Dulari and the two children were lying outside the house. The bodies of Ram Sakkhi and the children were found near the doorstep as if their assailants attacked them without giving a chance for them to escape. The bodies of Arun and Ram Dulari were lying some distance away which shows that they tried to escape but were attacked from behind after being chased a few meters,” he added.The body of Amar Singh was found in the farming field nearly 300 meters from the house. The ACP said that Ajay Singh and his son Avinash confessed to their crime and a sickle and a country-made firearm used in the crime have been recovered from their possession.“Ajay revealed during the interrogation that he suspected his father had illicit relations with his younger brother (Arun)’s wife, as the former used to give all his money to her, had purchased her ornaments recently, and was planning to transfer his entire farming land to her name. His younger brother, Arun, used to humiliate him whenever he used to stake a claim to the property.“Ajay often had arguments with his father and brother over the issue and even had a confrontation over selling some part of the family land for ₹ 8 lakh only a few days before the lockdown,” said the ACP.He said that around 15 days ago, Ajay had approached his mother requesting her to intercede on his behalf, so that he could get his share in the property but she refused to get involved.“Amar was feeling betrayed by his parents and brother and had planned their elimination since then. He first convinced his teenage son to assist him in the crime and then made all the preparations to commit it,” the ACP said.He said that Ajay planned to commit the crime in the evening as he was aware that no villager would turn up to help them, as all remain indoors at that time due to the lockdown. He procured a firearm from a local goon and handed over the sickle to his son before leaving to commit the crime.“The post-mortem of the bodies confirmed that all had injuries of a sharp-edged weapon but Arun’s body also sustained a bullet injury,” the ACP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/banthra-slaying-suspicion-greed-lead-killing-of-six/story-A1CFls6fxniHI1d3PBeMCN.html

02-05-2020||Gurugram||School body seeks clarity on govt order, deadline for late fee payment||The Haryana Progressive School Conference, a consortium of private schools, on Thursday, wrote to the chief minister demanding that the government issue appropriate clarifications and directions regarding fee payment by parents in the absence of which schools would be dependent on government reimbursement for paying salaries of employees. While the parents have sought a fee waiver, the district education department reiterated that all stakeholders must comply with its last order. On April 23, the state government had ordered that private schools could only seek monthly tuition fee till the time the lockdown continues. HPSC, however, claims that the government order had been misinterpreted by some parents who were hoping for a fee exemption. The HPSC said the government needed to clarify that no fee exemption had been directed and only deferment of payment of fee components other than ‘Tuition Fee’ had been granted for the duration of lockdown. In the absence of clarifications, schools will not be able to pay for the salaries of employees, said HPSC.“At ground level, the order is being misinterpreted by parents who think that no fee other than ‘tuition fee’ can be charged at all, even at a later date. It is our appeal that either the government provides aforementioned reimbursement or issues the directions requested to prevent a situation where schools are pushed to the wall and left with no other option but to stop salaries of their entire staff, teachers, admin staff, drivers, conductors, maids, guards and all employees, who would lose their livelihood,” states the letter.HPSC senior vice-president Colonel (retired) KR Pratap Singh said school will not be able to pay salaries of employees if fee deferment continued for long. He added that some schools had failed to pay the complete salaries to employees due to financial hardships. “The government has said that schools should not put pressure on parents to pay. We are complying with the order, but the cash flow needs to be maintained. If all parents decide to not pay, schools will have no other option but to depend on government reimbursements for paying salaries of employees,” said Singh.The HPSC also asked the government to clarify the last date for fee payment and suggested that June 30 be treated as a deadline, following which fee-defaulters can be removed from the school records. The April 23 order issued by the government mentions no last date for fee payment and clearly states that no student’s name can be struck off the roll for non-payment of fee.“Moreover, it should be made mandatory for such parents who can pay fee, to pay the fee on time,” the letter stated. Kailash Sharma, general secretary of Haryana Abhibhavak Ekta Manch, a parents’ body, said the government needed to remove the word deferred from its previous order and issue new orders stating a waiver. “The government has only deferred the payment of fees which means that schools would charge an exorbitant fee after the lockdown. Parents need to be given a waiver in light of the job losses and financial distress that they are facing,” said Sharma.District education officer Indu Boken said all stakeholders were expected to abide by the last order on fee payment, issued on April 23. “The government had issued an order on April 23. Since then, no new order on fee payment has been given. The last order mentioned that fee payment of certain components had been deferred. Moreover, schools cannot take punitive action for non-payment of fee,” Boken said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/school-body-seeks-clarity-on-govt-order-deadline-for-late-fee-payment/story-AojYAlWoWhAtGBjFD6Mt2K.html
02-05-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram reports 6 new cases of Covid-19; all patients had links with Delhi||The number of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases reached 63 in the city after six new cases were reported on Friday. Health officials said that all the six people, who have contracted the SARS-CoV-2 virus, had links with Delhi. “Three persons from Dundahera, two from Sector 18 and one from Jyoti Nagar tested positive for the virus. Investigation and contact tracing revealed that they all had visited Delhi or met with Covid-19 positive residents of Delhi,” said Dr Jaswant Singh Punia, chief medical officer(CMO).The man from Dundahera had visited Ram Manohar Lohia hospital for get treatment for his epileptic son. “The man returned to Gurugram on April 22 for a day while his son was undergoing treatment in Delhi. He got himself tested in Delhi before he came to Gurugram and returned to Delhi the next day. On April 25, he was confirmed positive for the coronavirus and was admitted to AIIMS, Jhajjar. Doctors in Delhi informed us about the case. Our teams collected the samples of all those he had come contact with. Three of them were tested positive for Covid-19,” said Punia.A young male, a resident of Jyoti Nagar, who worked for a referral ambulance service in Delhi, was also confirmed positive, while two men from Sector 18, who run a self-finance company, came in contact with a Delhi-based coronavirus positive patient this week after he visited Gurugram for some work. “The two men got themselves tested after their contact in Delhi was confirmed Covid-19 positive,” said Punia. Of the 63 cases reported in Gurugram, 38 have been discharged and 25 are currently undergoing treatment.In Faridabad too, eight new cases were reported on Friday. Yashpal Yadav, deputy commissioner(DC), Faridabad, said of the eight new cases, six are contacts of two vegetable vendors who had tested positive before, one is an auto driver with a travel history to Mathura, and one is a pharmacist at a private hospital in Delhi. 61 cases have been reported till now, out of which 42 have been discharged and 18 are undergoing treatment.The state government has sealed Gurugram, Faridabad, Sonepat and Jhajjar borders with Delhi, on the grounds that the cases reported in these districts had links with Delhi. Except for movement for essential items and services, public movement has been restricted across the borders.RAPID TESTINGThe district health team has started the rapid antibody testing in Jharsa, using the recently procured South Korean Rapid Testing Kits (RTKs). A total of 88 people were tested, of whom all were reported to be negative,said the health officials. The team visited a hostel where 350 nurses of Medanta Hospital were residing. Of these, 20 nurses were on leave while some of them were on duty. The health team collected 54 samples from Khandsa vegetable mandi (market) after conducting surveillance of 1,254 people. These samples have been sent to PGIMS, Rohtak for the RT-PCR test.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-reports-6-new-cases-of-covid-19-all-patients-had-links-with-delhi/story-QEfXBONaWR76sYtTgOWS3J.html
02-05-2020||Gurugram||Covid-19 update: Gurugram classified as ‘orange zone’ as lockdown is extended||Gurugram on Friday was classified as an orange zone, from earlier red zone, by the Union ministry of health and family welfare. An orange zone includes districts where new cases are emerging, but at a decreasing rate. A red zone is a hotspot area where cases there is a steady jump in cases frequently. Green zones are areas where no confirmed case has been reported in the last 21 days. The new colour code for Gurugram, however, is unlikely to spell any relief in terms of relaxations in lockdown norms, unless the state government frames specific guidelines regarding the same, district administration officials said. Districts in orange or red zones in the state will continue to work towards breaking the chain of transmission through effective and stringent containment measures. The Central government on Friday had extended the Covid-19 lockdown, which started on March 25 last month, by 14 more days. “Central government has changed the classification of red and orange zones by redefining the parameters. But the new classification won’t lead to relaxation till the state government gives its own orders based on the guidelines issued by the Union ministry of home affairs for measures that need to be taken in red, orange and green zones in the extended lockdown,” said VS Kundu, CEO, Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA), who is also the monitoring in-charge for Covid-19 in Gurugram.In Haryana, two districts — Faridabad and Sonepat — continue to be in the red zone, while Gurugram, Nuh, Palwal and 15 other districts are under orange zone. Only Mahendergarh and Rewari are under green zone. Till now, 357 Covid-19 cases have been reported in the state, of which 112 are undergoing treatment. Gurugram, Nuh, Palwal and Faridabad have been the most affected districts. At least 63 cases have been reported from Gurugram, 61 from Faridabad, 58 from Nuh and at least 34 from Palwal.There has been a change how colour coding is decided, with the Union government now factoring in other aspects — like doubling rate of Covid-19 cases, testing and surveillance — instead of just looking at cumulative number of cases. In Haryana, cases are doubling after every 20 days. On Thursday, Union health ministry had written to all states and said state government can designate additional red and orange zones but they cannot relax rules in the districts already classified as red or orange zone by the Central government. The colour-coding of districts will remain a dynamic process as it will be revised weekly. Currently, there are 130 red zone districts across the country, 284 orange zones and 319 green zones.As per the MHA guidelines, in an orange district like Gurugram maximum precautions will be taken in the containment zones, with restriction on public movement — except for medical emergencies and for supply of essential goods and services. Even in areas outside the containment zones, interstate movement will be restricted. Schools, colleges, cinema halls, gymnasiums, sports complexes, swimming pools, theatres, bars and other public places will continue to remain closed. However, taxis and cabs will be allowed to ply with a driver and two passengers. Inter-district movement will be allowed only for permitted activities.Being an orange zone, the Gurugram administration has already permitted 513 industries to operate.Lav Agrwal, joint secretary, Union health ministry, on Friday said, “Districts under the red and orange zone will have break the chain of transmission through effective and stringent containment measures.” He said that these districts will have to be delineated based on mapping of cases and contacts, their geographical dispersion, stringent perimeter control, like setting up clear entry and exit points, restricted movement — except for medical emergencies and essential goods and services — no unchecked influx of population, active surveillance, contact tracing, clinical management of all confirmed cases. Also, in the buffer zone, people infected with Influenza Like Illness (ILI) and Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) will have to be monitored.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-classified-as-orange-zone-as-lockdown-is-extended/story-I0JhiWLFkhFlTr2IUkZAEO.html

With this, the total number of Covid-19 cases from Sector 8 has reached. Since April 8, officials have shifted around 400 persons from slums in sectors 8 and 5 to government quarantine centres as a precautionary measure after four persons—one of whom was linked to fire safety solutions firm Ceasefire—tested positive for Covid-19 in the Sector 5 JJ Colony.Others who tested positive include a 36-year-old man from Sector 9, two senior citizens—a 71-year-old man from the Ace Golfshire in Sector 150 and a 76-year-old man from Sector 55—the wife of a Sector 55 patient, a 55-year-old man from Advocate Colony in PI 1st area of Greater Noida and 35-year-old from Skytech Matrott society in Sector 76. All the Sector 8 residents who tested positive on Friday were already under institutional quarantine, which has helped in containing the spread of Covid-19, health department officials said, adding that keeping people under institutional quarantine also helped stop community spread in slums of Sectors 8 and 5.They are yet to identify the exact source of infection among the 28 persons from Sector 8 but suspect the virus was first transmitted by four Sector 5 residents linked to Ceasefire company or the people who had direct or indirect contacts with those who had attended the religious congregation in last March in Delhi.“All the persons found positive for the infection were already under quarantine. In the past also, people who were found positive were under quarantine at our center. There are over 8,000 families living in the slums of sector 8 and 5 and we have managed to successfully contain the spread there through contact tracing,” said Suhas LY, district magistrate, GB Nagar.Meanwhile, two Covid patients, including a 9-year-old girl and a 39-year-old man (Ceasefire emplouee), were discharged from Sharda Hospital. The man is the only patient till now who had developed pneumonia and needed a ventilator. He was discharged after 37 days of successful treatment.By Friday night, the health department had notified 2,161 travelers. Officials collected 3,618 samples and 697 persons remain under institutional quarantine.HOT SPOTSThe health department declared 10 new hot spots as these areas had no Resident’s Welfare Associations to stop spread of Covid in these high-density areas.Villages in Greater Noida, including Tilpata, Bisrakh, Aichhar village in Dadri, Begumpur in Kulsera and Jaunchana in Jewar, are among the 10 identified hot spots where there are no RWAs. The remaining areas include Nithari, Chautpur, Kakrala, Sector 9 and 10 in Noida. Sectors 5 and 8 and Chauda village were already red zones.The police department has been asked to ensure that social distancing is followed strictly in these areas and action should be taken against violators as per protocol. Health teams will be visiting these areas to survey each and every house to identify people with Covid-like symptoms and to spread awareness about the virus. Suspects will be put under institutional quarantine and samples will be collected as per the protocol. Development authorities have been asked to increase sanitization of these areas.THREE PREGNANT COVID CASES AT GIMSA Bisrakh woman, who is in her last trimester of pregnancy, was admitted to the GIMS after she tested positive for Covid-19 in Ghaziabad, where she lives in her marital home. After testing positive, the woman, travelled to her maternal house in Bisrakh. She then went to the Sharda hospital for a regular check-up. As per protocol, she was suggested she take the Covid-19 test to which she informed the healthcare workers that she had already undergone this test and showed her report. The woman was immediately shifted to the Government Institute of Medical Sciences, where two other pregnant women are being treated for COVID-19; one has delivered a baby who was Covid-negative and sent home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/gb-nagar-reports-17-new-covid-19-cases-11-from-jj-slums/story-eUmr33zOpJ9K8jvYvRLARL.html
02-05-2020||Delhi||Graded easing of curbs to give most relief to low-risk regions||The Union home ministry’s order of extending the nationwide lockdown till May 17 has opened some room for conditional relaxations in the Capital. Movement of limited people in private vehicles, opening of essential shops in markets and shopping complexes, partial operations of private offices, in terms of physical attendance, industrial activities in notified estates and industrial areas, and in-situ construction activities could soon become a reality.However, none of the relaxations would be applicable to the containment zones. Till Friday, Delhi had 3,738 cases of Covid-19 and 96 containment zones.As on May 1, all 11 revenue districts in Delhi were hot spots or red zones. The fresh order, however, has listed seven broad areas in which even districts categorised as red zones can permit certain activities with conditional restrictions, but not inside notified containment zones.Operation of public transport, taxi services, autorickshaws, barbershops, spas and salons are explicitly prohibited in the red zones. The order also continued the ban on the sale of non-essential items by e-commerce companies.Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain on Friday said that the Capital, so far, has managed to turn four containment zones into green zones. However, these areas continue to be within districts that have mostly been categorised as a red zone or a high-risk zone.“Before scaling down restrictions in any locality, we will conduct thorough medical screening of each and every resident in the area. The relaxations, accordingly, will be based on the medical results of the population in that area,” said Jain.The health minister said that the Delhi government will soon come out with its own order to clarify allowed activities during the extended lockdown. State governments have been empowered to not allow any relaxation or impose stricter restrictions, if it deems fit, to prevent the spread of Covid-19 in the city.Under the MHA’s order issued on Friday, states can allow movement of individuals and vehicles (with a maximum of three occupants in cars and one occupant on two-wheelers) under permitted activities. “We need some clarification from the Centre on whether ‘permitted activities’ can extend essential services,” a Delhi government official said.The order stated that all stand-alone and neighbourhood shops, and those in residential complexes, irrespective of essential or non-essential goods, are allowed to remain open, but social distancing and wearing of masks by the staff are essential.Private offices can operate with 33% staff strength physically present on the premises and the rest working from home, the order states. All government officials, of deputy secretary rank and higher, can function with 100% staff, while 33% staff strength is allowed for other ranks.“We were already deliberating on opening some services under the public service sector, that include basics such as the issuance of birth certificate, death certificates, income certificates and caste certificates. The order provides room for that,” said another government official.Some of the enlisted activities that can witness scaling down of restrictions are reiterations of old guidelines, for instance, allowing activities in notified industrial areas and construction activity at sites that provide for accommodation of workers.Alcohol shops in Delhi are not likely to open, said senior officials, adding that the provisions regarding scaling down curbs on alcohol shops are applicable in public places, which essentially mean areas within orange and green zones. Delhi currently has none of them.Under the fresh order, states have been tasked with evaluating categories of districts in terms of red, orange and green zones, every seven days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/graded-easing-of-curbs-to-give-most-relief-to-low-risk-regions/story-WDpfUHGo3Jc7ITfHYjPOiP.html
02-05-2020||Noida||Noida authority to expedite work on industrial plot allotment scheme||The Noida authority on Friday said that it has decided to expedite the work on an industrial plot allotment scheme, which was delayed due to the imposition of the nationwide lockdown on March 25. Now the authority has decided to carry out all the formalities related to the scheme in the month of May so that the remaining work can be started right after the lockdown ends.The Noida authority had in January 1, 2020 started the process of allotting industrial plots of size more than 5 acres. These plots will be allotted through lucky draw after all applications are screened and interviewed, said officials. Many applicants have submitted their applications for the industrial plots. The authority was supposed to allot these plots in March. But due to the imposition of the lockdown, the process was halted. Now the authority wants to finish the process to accept the applications. The authority has roped in UP Industrial Consultants Limited (UPICO) as a consultant, which has started screening all the applications. “We have asked the UPICO to examine all forms by May 6 and inform applicants if there are any discrepancies in the form. Once it is done, the remaining process should be finished by May 20 so that further work can be started right after the lockdown ends,” said Ritu Maheshwari, chief executive officer(CEO), Noida authority. The authority has a limited number of plots under this industrial plot scheme, which is meant for large-sized industrial units. These plots fall in areas such as sectors 157, 158 and 159 and those located along the Noida Expressway. The authority has a total of 350 hectares of industrial land that has not been allotted so far. Noida, a Delhi suburb spread across 20,000 hectares of land between the Yamuna and Hindon rivers, has grown into a residential town with 47% of its total area meant for residential purposes and 13% for industries. Noida was established in 1976 with an aim to encourage industrialisation and job-creation. The focus shifted from industrial to residential in early 2000s. Now, however, the authority wants to focus solely on industrial growth to fuel the local economy and create jobs in order to make up for the loss in the real estate sector, which is seeing sales plummet to an all-time low, said officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-authority-to-expedite-work-on-industrial-plot-allotment-scheme/story-AOScdYT8JaNq5C7FimFYNO.html
02-05-2020||Delhi||Cases higher in Delhi due to scaled-up testing, says Arvind Kejriwal||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday said the number of Covid-19 cases in the national Capital is high because his government has scaled up testing for the disease and said there is nothing to rumours that say plasma therapy trials in Delhi could be stopped. The CM added that the trials are going on “in full swing” and that the government has identified over 1,000 more donors. In a digital address to the media, Kejriwal said Delhi is conducting as many as 2,300 Covid-19 tests per million population, which is higher than the national average of around 500 tests per million. At present, Delhi has conducted over 50,000 tests, of which about 7,000 are in the containment zones.  Delhi’s dashboard on Friday stood at 3,738 positive cases. The city-state has 96 containment zones, spread across all 11 districts that have been marked as red zones.“When we see that Delhi has recorded over 3,500 cases till now, the number may appear to be very high. But, this is because we are testing aggressively. That is also why we are setting up so many containment zones so that the detected cases can be isolated and the chain of transmission can be broken,” Kejriwal said. He also said that analysing the national data, Delhi has more recoveries and fewer deaths than other states. As per ICMR data until April 30, Delhi had the lowest fatality rate, 1.7% of total cases, among the five states with the highest number of cases. The national average is 3.3%.Rajasthan, however, had the highest recovery rate, of 34.4%, followed by Delhi, at 31.1%. The national average 25.19%.PLASMA THERAPY TRIALAsserting that initial results of the plasma therapy trials have been positive, the chief minister said that these will not be discontinued. “A few days ago, the Central government had made some remarks (about the use of the therapy) after which many people asked me if Delhi is discontinuing the trials. No, we are not. In fact, trials are going on in full swing,” he said. His reference is to the health ministry’s clarification that the experimental treatment can only be done as a trial, and with requisite regulatory approval. Kejriwal also said that “almost all” the 1,100 people who recovered in Delhi are willing to donate plasma.“We got permission from the Centre to conduct plasma trials at the Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan Hospital. The first patient to have recovered has been discharged. He was very serious and was in the ICU (intensive care unit). So, the initial results are very promising,” the chief minister said.MORE RATION FROM THIS MONTHOn the occasion of the International Labour Day, Kejriwal announced that the Delhi government will be increasing the free ration quota to every cardholder from this month. “We are increasing the quantum of ration from 7.5kg to 10kg per person from this month and it will continue to be free. Usually, ration cardholders were entitled to 5kg of ration at subsidised rates. Last month, we had made it free and increased it by 1.5 times to 7.5kg. So, this month we have doubled people’s ration quota from what it was during non-Covid times,” he said. The chief minister also said that the government will soon begin distribution of kits having oils, rice, chillies, salt, soap, etc. He also urged the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) workers to help the needy people in their respective areas.MOVEMENT OF STUDENTS AND MIGRANT WORKERSThe Delhi government on Friday sent 45 buses from Delhi to Kota, to ferry back students stranded in the Rajasthan town. Senior government officials said that at least 800 students are expected to return to the Capital.“I am hoping that by tomorrow, these buses will come back,” Kejriwal said. “The Centre, last week, allowed inter-state movement of students, migrant workers, tourists, pilgrims and others,” said Kejriwal, adding that the Delhi government is in talks with Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Haryana and Jharkhand to facilitate the movement of migrant workers, pilgrims and others who want to go return to their home town.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/cases-higher-in-delhi-due-to-scaled-up-testing-says-kejriwal/story-qg5HV9JEoDTvRBxCDf9FEN.html
02-05-2020||Pune||PCMC’s tech-driven Covid-19 ‘war room’ gives updates at a glance||When the national lockdown to deal with the Covid-19 (coronavirus) pandemic was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 23, Pimpri-Chinchwad municipal commissioner Shravan Hardikar realised that this would mean more than just a government order.The police force alone would not be able to enforce it on its own but would require the support of other departments. Realising this, Hardikar said, “We quickly put a team together that first outlined the plan. We were already working on building a Smart City for Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC), but realised that what an epidemic needed was a ‘war room’. “A war room is a concept of managing an exigency under a central command.The goal of the war room was to integrate human interface with data and technology with intelligence to plan strategically.Work began on March 15 and it was ready by March 23. “We started with one computer, but now we are full-fledged and the daily reporting comes out systematically from our dashboard,” said Hardikar.The war room has eight screens, a dashboard and a huge network to keep a watch on the spread of the Sars-Cov-2 virus. Every clinic, every diagnostic centre (including three government institutions and seven private facilities) are connected to this facility at the PCMC.“Anytime a doctor examines a patient and suspects that he may be infected with Covid-19, the data is noted and sent to the central war room. After testing, the reports are notified. Patients who are advised to self- isolate are tracked via a GIS (Geographic Information System) encrypted within the system. Every time he ventures out, the information is visible on one of the eight screens and action is initiated,” said Hardikar.“Apart from tracking patients, even a gathering of people in these curfew times is immediately noted for further action. Police and medical teams keep a constant vigil on the screens and the dashboard,” he said.The dashboard shows all the information needed to keep a watch on the epidemic. “One look at the dashboard and it will tell us how many positives, how many are admitted to hospitals in PCMC and outside; how many patients are not from PCMC, but admitted in our hospitals and how many recoveries, discharged, deaths,” he said.”It also tells how many are quarantined so that our team can make field visits. “Our team visits a containment zone every alternate day,” said the PCMC civic chief.The dashboard also throws up real-time info on hotspots that are linked to the GIS which help in taking decisions related to sealing of various zones. With surveillance cameras, our police teams can take action on violations, added Hardikar.In addition to this PCMC has a call centre linked to their app, Saarthi, as well as a ChatBot on WhatsApp where residents can register a complaint. The ChatBot has a location tracker and that helps in geo-fencing their residence if need be.What is a war room and how does it work?A war room is a concept of managing an exigency under a central command.The war room has eight screens, a dashboard and a huge network to keep a watch on the spread of the Sars-Cov-2 virus.

02-05-2020||Pune||Kho Kho athletes miss crucial ground practice, says chairman of the Maharashtra kho kho association||The month of April and May is packed with summer camps and private tournaments for kho kho athletes in the city. However, this year kho kho action has been put on hold due to covid-19 restrictions.The camps are a great opportunity to spot raw talent especially in the under-14 age category, according to Sachin Godbole, chairman of the Maharashtra kho kho association.“Summer camps are something which are conducted on a large extent in Maharashtra during these two months. Many camps also take place in villages across the state,” Godbole added.Prior to the lockdown, the city was geared up to conduct the mayor’s kho kho cup where athletes from across the state had assembled at the Sanas ground hostel. However, the tournament was cancelled last minute. Most athletes have returned home from Pune.It is difficult to explain kho kho techniques over video conference, according to Godbole.“On the ground, you can quickly give a demo and players comprehend it,” he said.More than the association, individual coaches and umpires are currently in touch with the players and many of them are sending athletes videos of fitness drills on a daily basis.“What I have asked the coaches to do is to keep the athletes mentally fresh because many players may overthink in the current scenario and keeping them motivated is very important at the moment,” added Godbole.The association is currently focusing on conducting online practice exams for umpires and coaches.“A few days back we just announced an online practice exam for umpires. The idea behind it was to keep umpires in touch with rules. We have received a good number of entries and many new entrants tried to crack it. Now, we will be doing a similar thing for coaches,” Godbole said.Normal season predictionMost of the kho kho tournaments are conducted in September, October and November annually and the association is hoping that things will return to normal by September this year.“The months of June, July and August are generally an off season for kho kho players where most of them focus on fitness. Due to the rainy season, grounds in the city are not available so our players prepare themselves in these three months and stay ready for the tournaments,” added Godbole.Funding challengesKho kho is a traditional sport that attracts funding from most political parties, however with a large number of donations going to covid-19 response this year, it may hurt the sport.“How much leaders would be able to support sports, we cannot say at the moment. Even if they are willing to do it, they need to check their budget and currently there are many other priorities than sports,” Godbole said.The Maharashtra kho kho association has made a contribution of Rs 1,11,000 to the chief minister’s relief fund.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kho-kho-athletes-miss-crucial-ground-practice-godbole/story-S4lCM1zbKH4vKFBhWONcQO.html

02-05-2020||Pune||‘From towing the two-wheeler to on spot repair, we are offering free service’||Harish Angolkar, president, Scooter, Motorcycle Repairer Research Association People associated with emergency services required in the fight against Covid-19 (coronavirus) do not have to worry about being stranded if their two-wheelers develop a technical snag. A call to the Scooter, Motorcycle Repairer Research Association (SMRRA) will help locate mechanics in the area. The association’s president, Harish Angolkar, 57, says that all repair work is free of cost. Angolkar who is a mechanical engineer also has a garage called Automaint in Model colony. The association has 450 members in Pune.What exactly is your role in this crisis?Our garages have been shut March 21, however, we would receive numerous calls from essential workers regarding technical sag in their vehicles. After a video call with the members of the association,we decided to help them. From towing the two-wheeler to repairing on the spot, we are offering them free service, we only charge for the parts which need replacing. We have created a team of 25 members who have the garage and the house together to save travelling out. We have covered areas like Bibvewadi, Kothrud, Karvenagar, Model Colony, Shivajinagar, Sadashiv peth, Shaniwar peth, and Deccan gymkhana. We directly went to the police with our request and they not only supported us but also guided us on how to reach a spot immediately when needed. We have offered help to 350 people so far out of which 40 per cent are police officials. The first case was that of a doctor from Ratna hospital, near my garage in Model Colony.How does your day begin and roll out?I am a professional badminton player hence I exercise on my house terrace. I start taking calls post 9 am. Once I get a call, I confirm if the person is an essential worker and then coordinate with the association member in the area. This continues till 4 pm. We have also received distress calls at night.What precautions are you taking?We always wear masks, jackets and gloves. We do not allow customers to stand with us while we are doing repair work, We ask them about the problem on call and tend to the vehicle alone. We use a sanitiser before and after the repair work is done.What is your assessment of the Covid-19 crisis n Pune? How is it unfolding?The civic administration is doing a very good job, but some people do not understand the graveness of the situation. In peth areas, people are using the time period, which is given to purchase essential products, to roam around instead of sitting at home. I appeal to people to not misuse this time period.What gaps do you see in health and relief work?A lot of people are not receiving credible information and hence believe in rumours which creates panic. Recently in Wadharwadi someone mentioned that free food grains were being donated and people gathered in the chowk, causing problems for the police. People should be firm and only buy essentials at one time, it not necessary to go out every day, plus they should take advantage of weekly or 15-day food packages which are sold by many green grocers and vegetable sellers to reduce the number of outings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/from-towing-the-two-wheeler-to-on-spot-repair-we-are-offering-free-service/story-EBWTRrQDf0dKdVLiq7N5MN.html

02-05-2020||Pune||Hit by lockdown, commercial property owners, tenants in Pune settle rentals amicably||With no income during the last 40 days of lockdown imposed amid Covid-19 (coronavirus) crisis, the issue of collecting lease rent from business enterprises has become tricky for commercial property owners in the city.In a number of cases, the property owners and their clients have tried to work towards an amicable solution as the loss of business has been sudden and due to reasons beyond anyone’s control.Sanjay Sangamnerkar who operates a hair salon at Padmavati, said, “For the last one-and-half months, my shop is closed and routine expenses at home have to be met such as payment of utility bills, payment to my workers and other expenses at home. I am paying rent of Rs 18,000 rent for my shop and I have requested the owner to give me two months time to pay the rent. The owner has agreed.”Sangamnerkar said, “I cannot ask the owner to waive the rent for the entire month as he is a senior citizen and the rent from the shop is a part of his retirement earnings. He too has been cooperative and so I have decided to pay the full rent but over a period of two months or so.”Lakhan Yadav who runs a sweet shop on Satara road said he has been paying a monthly rent of Rs 24,000 for a 200 sq ft area. “I do not wish to deprive the owner of his rent,” said Yadav, noting that he had earned well during the festival seasons and the owner had not asked for anything extra on that occasion.Sunil Shah, owner of two shops near Mukundnagar said he uses the rent amount to pay the bank loan instalments towards that property. “Considering the situation we are in, I have told my tenants not to worry and make deferred payment as and when their cash starts flowing back. “I don’t think banks are going to waive off our EMI (equated monthly instalments),” he said.Santosh Kumar who runs a laundry near Dhankawadi said like all others who are running small businesses, he too had no work for the entire month due to the lockdown. “There is no question of people giving clothes for washing and ironing. I have taken to selling fruits and vegetables in the meantime to earn some money. I requested my owners to defer the rent and he has agreed. I did not ask for my rent to be waived fully or partly as the owner is supportive,” he said.Anis Shergadwala, real estate agent of Sofiya Properties in Undri, who looks after 100 commercial units of mostly non-resident Indians, said, “ Post lockdown we have advised all our clients to give minimum fifty per cent concession in monthly rent which they have agreed. The concession must be given to the tenants as they have been paying regular rent and looking after the commercial properties of the investors.”“We have even advised them to consider waiving off the rent as the establishments are completely shut,” he said.Sanjeev Singh of Tailspin Properties said, “The shops are closed for an indefinite period. The tenants have informed their landlords that they will pay the arrears once their establishments start the business and it stabilises. The tenants have requested the owners that their contracts must not be terminated as it would lead to unemployment and loss of business.”Mahesh Salian, a property broker from NIBM road, said “ The tenants have taken their landlords into confidence and told them that once the business starts operating, they will ensure that the rent is paid. At the same time, we have also requested the landlords to take a considerate view of the tenants.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hit-by-lockdown-commercial-property-owners-tenants-settle-rentals-amicably/story-y2YipjVbGrRjCm0LBkyVEJ.html
02-05-2020||Delhi||Dr Alka Chaudhari: When she’s not treating patients, the ‘doktarni’ at Delhi’s first mohalla clinic feeds families of 35 daily-wagers||Dr Alka Chaudhary, 48, has been working in the city’s first mohalla clinic in Peera Garhi since it started five years ago. In that time, she has grown to know each and every family in the neighbourhood, where she is referred to as ‘doktarni’. Her patients visit her with all their problems, which range from fever, cough and cold, to family disputes.So it was natural for them to come to her when the government first announced the biggest lockdown in the world to control the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in March.“Soon after the lockdown in March, this boy Imtiaz came to me and said, Doktarni, help me get to my village. He said, there is no work and why should we stay here and go hungry? This is a slum area and most people are daily wagers – some are rickshaw pullers, others carpenters and plumbers – all their livelihoods have been severely impacted. But I told him it wasn’t safe to travel and the government was making arrangements for food,” said Chaudhary.However, after speaking to the families in the area and the ASHA workers under her, she realised there was a problem. They were getting food twice a day through the government’s food distribution drive, but most did not get any dry ration as they did not have Delhi ration cards. “I realised two meals a day are just not enough when there are children in the house. Children, especially the very young ones, asked for food during the day. So, I thought I should give whatever I can,” she said.Dr Chaudhary got some grocery from her house to give the first family in March, and has since taken 35 families under her wing. One of the families is of Karn, who had come to her two weeks ago looking emaciated.“He was this tall guy, but weighed no more than 30 kg. He was collapsing; he had no strength. A test report he had got from some private clinic showed that his blood sugar levels were 406 (normal levels are about 140 mg/dL after eating),” said Alka.She immediately went to the local police station and asked for their help to hire an e-rickshaw to get the man to a hospital. On Thursday, he came to meet her and thank her for her help.“I have made packets of weekly supplies. I have also fixed a milkman for some of these families that have very young children. I pay the man at the end of the month. I cannot do this on my own and I have asked my family to help out. I have told those in corporate jobs to give me some money, anything that they would donate to temples or other causes. I have told them that it would go to the needy,” she said. She has also been helping people with filling out the ration coupon forms on her phone.Her family understands what she does, but is still bothered by her routine. Every afternoon, after finishing up at her clinic, she goes to the nearby areas to speak to the people and check how they are doing. “My mother asks me whether I would get an award for doing this, she asks me to wear the neela thaila as she refers to the PPE kits. She is very disappointed that I do not get it. My sister says that she prays that I get wise and my niece tells me that I should get a room in the jugghi itself. One of the nurses jokes that we should just put Fevicol on madam’s chair so she can’t leave,” said Dr Chaudhry. Adding to the worries of her family, she is a diabetic herself.She moved out of the house where her elderly in-laws live since the Covid-19 outbreak started. She lives with her husband. Her in-laws still do not know that she goes to the slum area after her clinic.Whenever someone comes to her, she tells them about the invisible enemy and explains why they should remain indoors. “But they live in small houses without much ventilation. It is not possible to stay indoors throughout the day. So I tell them when you feel like stepping out, at least cover your nose and mouth with a dupatta and sit at a distance from your friends,” she said. She took the help of some of the local boys to put on a small skit, where they dressed up as ‘Yamraaj’ and explained how people will die if social distancing was not followed.“If I did not tell them what social distancing was and why they needed to follow it, who would? Because they do not see people dropping dead, they do not understand why there should be a lockdown and why they should stay at home” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dr-alka-chaudhari-when-she-s-not-treating-patients-the-doktarni-at-delhi-s-first-mohalla-clinic-feeds-families-of-35-daily-wagers/story-0DYFwZI7KLjo8NqjcqDwEK.html
02-05-2020||Delhi||Traders crowd Ghazipur market, social distancing norms flouted||Social distancing norms went for a toss at the Ghazipur fruit and vegetable wholesale market in east Delhi, as people crowded the market on Friday morning. Around 6am, traders started queuing up to enter the market and the barricades set up at the entry and exit points, to regulate movement, were pushed aside by the crowd. Some people were also seen without masks, despite government mandating it.Market officials attributed the rush to the changed timings and new guidelines issued by the district administration, according to which visitors are allowed to shop between 6am and 11am, after goods are unloaded between 4am and 6am.SP Gupta, chairman Ghazipur Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC), said, “Normally, traders from nearby markets in Shahdara and Geeta Colony start coming to the mandi from 3am and return by 6am. But due to changed timings, mandi gates were closed for traders till 6am, due to which long queues formed, which later swelled into a huge crowd.”The police registered five cases of lockdown violations against traders on Friday.Ghazipur Mandi is the second-largest wholesale vegetable and fruit market in the city. It is spread over an area of one square kilometre area and receives supplies from around 400 trucks per day.A police officer, who did not wish to be named, said that the traders who had come to the market from 3am to 6am were not allowed to enter and they started queueing up.“Many small traders and vendors used to start selling vegetables in their vehicles at the mandi itself, which led to a crowd. Social distancing norms were completely flouted. A similar situation had arisen on Wednesday when the footfall at the mandi had almost tripled because of the coronavirus cases reported from other mandis. On Thursday, we held meetings with state administration officials and civic authorities, and, as a precaution, decided that wholesale buyers and traders would be allowed inside the mandi only after 6 am, once the trucks are out,” the officer said.The police used public announcement systems to inform those who were waiting about the revised timings. Traders were peacefully controlled and the small vendors, who are not allowed entry, were dispersed. There was no violence or law and order escalation reported, the police officer said.The deputy commissioner of police (east) Jasmeet Singh said that five FIRs were registered against shopkeepers for not wearing masks, flouting mandi guidelines, violating lockdown and for unauthorised vending.At least 24 FIRs were registered for violating the lockdown at Ghazipur mandi in April.A senior district administration official said that as wholesale markets are vulnerable to the spread of coronavirus disease, arrangements were made to ensure social distancing.“Since the order was released Thursday evening, many vendors and buyers were not aware of the new guidelines, which led to confusion and crowding. We have now disseminated the information about the new system at the mandi and are closely monitoring the situation. The mandi is expected to function smoothly from tomorrow (Saturday),” the official said.Azadpur MandiAs many as 16 traders at Delhi’s Azadpur Mandi tested Covid-19 positive and 43 contacts were quarantined till Friday evening. Test results of over 100 persons associated with the market are awaited, while over 500 have been screened. Around 25 shops in the wholesale market have been sealed. On Thursday, the number of Covid-19 positive cases was 15.Adil Ahmad Khan, chairman Azadpur APMC, said that the wholesale market was functioning normally and it received 6,000 tonnes of vegetable and fruits on Friday. Normally, nearly 8,000 tonnes of fruits and vegetables are supplied to the market every day.“There is no need to panic. Two medical teams have been deployed in the wholesale market to conduct health checks of traders and shoppers. These teams are stationed at two mohalla clinics on the mandi premises,” Khan said.Okhkla marketThe Okhla wholesale market was shut on Friday and Saturday for sanitisation, said officials. No positive case has been reported at the market. From Sunday, it will be open all hours of the day, throughout the week||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/traders-crowd-ghazipur-market-social-distancing-norms-flouted/story-ObJG5SCsuBVQ7GREPYZwpL.html
02-05-2020||Gurugram||Ggm border sealed, 1,200 stopped, turned back to Delhi||Hundreds of commuters were stopped and turned back from the Gurugram-Delhi border on Friday after the district administration sealed the border and issued an order stating only people who had been issued restricted movement passes by Central and state governments will be allowed to cross.Residents of the two cities, who have been travelling across the borders daily for work, were asked to stay wherever they were at present. All the 11 borders had been closed from 10am on Friday and will remain shut till further orders. The restriction will be reviewed on a periodic basis, said police.The decision to seal the border completely was taken after a sizeable number of Covid-19 cases reported in Gurugram were traced back to Delhi. Till Friday, 63 Covid-19 cases had been reported in Gurugram.On Friday, confusion reigned supreme, with more than 1,200 commuters at Sirhaul border being told to return back to the capital despite having permissions from Delhi police to travel, police said .Commuters were seen crying and requesting police personnel to let them cross the border but to no avail. More than 200 people had parked their vehicles on Friday morning near the barricades and tried to cross the border walking but were not allowed.Karan Goel, assistant commissioner of police (DLF) who was deployed at the Sirhaul border, said it was challenging to control the situation as more than 1,200 commuters in the morning had to be turned back to Delhi and were not allowed to cross despite having valid permission from district administration of the capital. Around 234 vehicles were allowed to cross. “All the old permissions have been cancelled and the employees working in Gurugram were asked to make arrangements in the city if they are involved in essential services units,” he said.Police said they were also monitoring the number of vehicles crossing the border and those that returned. The daily report will be submitted to commissioner of police every evening, said a police officer.Police officers also said that vehicles ferrying vegetables, fruits, grains, poultry and other eatables, fodder for animals, medicines, medical equipment and raw materials used in manufacturing protective gear, sanitisers and ventilators were being allowed to cross the border. The vehicles can have only one support staff, besides the driver.However, food delivery boys, lab assistants and other employees were denied entry into Gurugram.Vansh Khurana, a pet dealer who supplies pet food in Gurugram said he was denied entry despite having all valid permissions. “I used to visit every day as food for pets fall under essential items. But police refused entry to me. I was carrying orders for more than 20 families, but now I will have to return and the clients will have to manage with some substitute,” he said.The police, however, refuted the allegations and said no individual deliveries will be allowed. Onlytrucks or vehicles with permission can cross the borders. “More than 100 delivery boys carrying food and poultry items were denied entry as they were individuals and were suppling to independent clients, which is no longer allowed. People can buy essential stuff from super marts and groceries stores which are open,” said Goel. To ensure inter-state and inter-district supply chain is not affected, the movement of vehicles carrying essential and non-essential items will be allowed to cross the national and state highways. However, these vehicles will not be allowed to halt in Gurugram. For movement of any other vehicles, except those exempted, permission has to be sought from the deputy commissioner’s office.Deputy commissioner of Gurugram, Amit Khatri, on Friday said that he has asked government and private organisations in Gurugram and Delhi to make lodging arrangements for their employees — including essential staff such as health and sanitation workers — to avoid any undue hardships. “We have deployed duty magistrates at all police posts and all the borders, starting Friday,” he said. Khatri said that rapid antibody testing of suspected cases will also be conducted at the Delhi-Gurugram borders, besides thermal scanning, from Saturday. Drivers and helpers undertaking cross-border movement will have to remain in isolation at dedicated facilities, on their return to Gurugram. Those moving across borders have been asked to install the Aarogya Setu application on their mobile phones for contact tracing and monitoring their locations.Mohammad Akil, the Gurugram commissioner of police, said all police posts and checkpoints will implement the restrictions strictly. “The monitoring at the borders will be conducted under the supervision of an assistant commissioner of police (ACP) and magistrate under continuous video surveillance,” he said.Any violation of the restrictions will invite criminal proceedings under relevant sections of Disaster Management Act, 2005, and the Indian Penal Code.People with restricted movement passes, authorised by officers of Centre or Haryana government, ambulances, vegetable, and milk suppliers, LPG and oil tankers, ATM cash vans and such similar essential goods and services have been exempted from the restrictions.The district has only allowed essential services and goods as well as some government officials to cross the border. Officers from Union ministry of home affairs, Union finance and defence ministries and those from Department of Post, Disaster Management, National Informatics Centre, FCI have been exempted, said officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/ggm-border-sealed-1-200-stopped-turned-back-to-delhi/story-WvNc9ghduPSwHUapPe77SJ.html
02-05-2020||Delhi||Govt takes back order seeking explanation from infected health care staff||The Delhi government on Friday suspended an order that asked medical directors of all its hospitals to seek a written explanation from health care workers who get infected or come in contact with Covid-19 positive patients, after attracting fierce criticism. “All Medical Directors are directed to obtain written explanation … as how these persons got infected or become a contact in spite of wearing required protective gears, maintaining safe distance and following precautions prescribed for healthcare workers,” the order read.This was done as medical directors of non-Covid hospitals were “indiscriminately” sending doctors, nurses, paramedics and other staff members to quarantine either at hotels or their homes for 14 days, leading to a shortage of staff, according to the order.“It seems, it is happening because either hospitals are not following standard SOPs [standard operating procedures] or such persons are not following guidelines prescribed for healthcare workers,” according to the order.So far, at least 293 health care workers — doctors, nurses, technicians, ambulance staff, sanitation workers, and hospital security — in the city have tested positive for Covid-19. Most of them worked either in non-Covid-19 hospitals or areas of hospitals that accept Covid-19 patients.At Babu Jagjivan Ram Memorial hospital in Jahangirpuri, at least 75 staff members have tested positive for the infection. At the nearby Baba Saheb Ambedkar hospital around 45 staff have tested positive, with the medical director also having to go into quarantine.“Delhi government should stop issuing ill-advised circulars targeting health care workers. Stop victim-blaming when hospitals are not ensuring the availability of appropriate PPE [personal protective equipment] despite a Supreme Court order,” said Dr Srinivas Rajkumar T, general secretary of the Resident Doctors’ Association of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences.“It is the hospitals not adhering to safety guidelines, not designating separate areas for Covid and non-Covid patients, and poor planning and execution that has resulted in the infection spreading to health care workers. The government should stop blaming health care workers as a cover for its deficiencies. If every hospital is asked to declare its PPE utilisation per health care worker and the status of stock, along with the quality of PPE, it will be evident who is at fault,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/govt-takes-back-order-seeking-explanation-from-infected-health-care-staff/story-EilbE3sSA4KF0SIyUN3nMM.html
02-05-2020||Chandigarh||Ludhiana Congress protests against Centre’s ‘discrimination’ against non-BJP-ruled states||Alleging discrimination against states where the Bharatiya Janata Party was not in power, workers of Punjab Congress staged a protest near the statue of Bhimrao Ambedkar near Jalandhar bypass here on Friday, and also asked residents to hoist the Tricolour on their rooftops in solidarity. The response, however, remained lukewarm in Ludhiana. “The central government is discriminating against the non-BJP states even in the time of a pandemic. It has not extended any help to the Punjab government to fight this challenging situation,” said local Congress leader Ashwani Sharma.Slamming the BJP leaders, who also protested against the Congress-led state government by keeping a fast on Friday claiming discrepancies in distribution of food grains to the needy, Sharma said that the BJP leadership is playing dirty politics. “They should instead should urge the Centre to release the pending GST instalment of the state and announce a special package for Punjab,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ludhiana-cong-protests-against-centre-s-discrimination-against-non-bjp-ruled-states/story-CgoeQo9blKOg968uPRK0UK.html

The ACs would be installed in the nursing station. The medical fraternity has been long complaining that it really difficult for doctors and nurses to work while wearing PPE suits amid the rising temperature. There have also been several reports where doctors fell ill on account of working in such a difficult condition. Rahul Verma, a member of the association, said there was no AC installed in the station as there is no provision for installing the same under government rules. When the association came to know about the same, it decided to donate 15 ACs..Verma also appreciated the efforts of the team installing the ACs by wearing PPE kits.Verma said that four ACs have already been installed and the others would be installed in the coming days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/focal-point-dyers-donate-15-acs-to-civil-hospital-in-ludhiana/story-yGocczvkiM2YJuDLyvk51O.html
02-05-2020||City||Lacklustre Labour Day: Ludhiana workers facing heat of lockdown, not receiving proper ration, salaries||The International Labour Day or May Day is observed each year on May 1 and is a public holiday in many countries, including India.Organisations used to take out processions to highlight labour issues, organise events to honour labourers for excellence and distribute gifts, but no such event could be organised this time due to the spread of Covid-19 pandemic.Out of work and on the verge of starvation, all they want is to go back to their native places and want the government to make special arrangements for this.Ludhiana, being an industrial hub, is home to over 7 lakh migrant workers, hailing from Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand and several other states. After the lockdown was announced on March 23, these migrant workers were the main sufferers as most of them depended on daily earnings to meet their everyday family needs.After 40-day lockdown, the government has now given partial relaxation to open some industrial units with conditions, but still thousands of daily wage workers, school bus drivers, those working in shops, eateries and in markets, rickshaw-pullers, etc are still sitting idle at home and waiting for the lockdown to end.“It is difficult for us to explain how we are surviving these days. In the past 40 days, we have spent what we had saved. Now we are not earning anything,” said Moji Ram, 38, residing in a labour quarter at Focal Point.Ram, who hails from Damoh district of Madhya Pradesh and is residing here with his wife and five children, said, “Since the lockdown, I have received a ration kit only once and the kit contained 10 kg wheat flour, 2 kg pulses and 2 kg of sugar. “How a family of seven members can survive with this kit for 40 days?,” he questioned, adding that the kit ration lasted for just 10 days, and after that we were left with nothing to cook.He added, “I was working in a garment manufacturing unit near Cheema Chowk and have not received salary for April. Earlier, we were paid leave on this day, but this time we have no work at all.”In the labour quarters, there are around 20 families with each family comprising a minimum of five members. Around eight of these families belong to Madhya Pradesh while others are from Bihar.Another migrant worker, Sarita Devi, 37, of Patna (Bihar) who was working in an iron rod manufacturing unit in the Focal Point, also shared the same problem. She added her employer used to pay half of the salary on May 1, and remaining in the middle of the month, but this time, she did not get anything.“My husband is a daily wage labourer and he has been sitting idle at home since March 22. We have already run out of cash to purchase essentials. During initial days of curfew, some NGOs were serving langar here, but now they have also stopped coming and it has become difficult for us to survive,” she said, adding she does not know how to support her three children.Sarita said, “Recently, my family members deposited Rs 2,000 in my account and I purchased some ration. But, I shared this ration with some other families in the quarters who had nothing to eat. We are now worried about our future.”The labourers, residing in other labour quarters in Ranjit Nagar of Focal Point, claimed that the ration was also not being distributed by the government in a proper manner. Some families have not even received a single kit so far, they alleged.Neeraj, 30, of Patna, who was working in a garment shop, said he had not received any salary after lockdown and the employer was even not picking up the calls.He said, “What Labour Day? Labourers were misused by employers all the time. Earlier, they used to make us work for 12 hours and paid a meagre amount of Rs 10,000 per month and, now when our employers should help us during these days, they are only ignoring us.”AITUC HIGHLIGHT PLIGHT OF WORKERSThe All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC) observed the day by gathering and holding placards highlighting the plight of workers at Haibowal Kalan, Rishi Nagar, Barewal Road, Pakhowal Road, Dhandran Road, Salem Tabri, Rahon Road observing all the guidelines such as social distancing and wearing masks.The day was also observed by employees of Punjab Roadways, PRTC, MC Zone A and D, PAU and PSPCL. They demanded immediate supply of ration to the needy, payment of Rs 6,000 each to all the workers. They also wanted ration to all the workers without any pre-conditions.They also demanded special trains so that labourers could go to their respective native places instead of starving here.DP Maur, vice-president of the Punjab unit of AITUC, said, “Workers are at the receiving end because of lockdown, daily wage-earners are the worst hit. “They are not receiving any ration. The government officials, instead of making tall claims, should check the realty at the ground and come to the rescue of these workers,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lacklustre-labour-day-ludhiana-workers-facing-heat-of-lockdown-not-receiving-proper-ration-salaries/story-Uvy9ZF94H7QwMhjMNPqzML.html

While the containment strategy would be enforced strictly in these micro-clusters, restrictions in the rest of the city would be eased,” he said.The precise details would be announced later once the guidelines are received from the central and state governments, he said.Pune is the second worst-hit city by the Covid-19 pandemic in Maharashtra after Mumbai with 86 deaths, and 1,518 positive cases as of April 30.Most of the cases are emerging from slum pockets in five of the 15 wards, namely, Bhawani peth, Kasba-Vishrambaug, Dhole Patil, Shivajinagar and Yerawada-Kalas-Dhanori.“PMC is identifying micro-clusters from where maximum Covid-19 positive cases are emerging and restrictions would continue in these areas. These hotspots would be converted into micro-clusters,” he said.Additional municipal commissioner Rubal Agrawal said that a meeting has been called with the police, district administration and civic officials to finalise the micro-clusters on Saturday.“PMC is preparing a plan on what restrictions should be relaxed and what precautions should be followed by the citizens. The final plan would be in place after receiving the new guidelines issued by the central and state governments,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lockdown-may-be-eased-in-parts-of-pune-after-may-3-says-civic-chief/story-e7Vc4mp3BSLiuQfS7bRCcP.html

Also, during this challenging time, they are made to work overtime on meagre salaries, they added. “We have been forced to protest. Many of us are risking our lives and doing our duty for a mere salary of Rs 6,500. The class-IV employees are working in the same unit for a salary of Rs 4,500,” said a protesting nurse.The protesters said government should give them permanent jobs and all the employees should also be covered under the state’s insurance policy.“We are working overtime on meagre salaries, but no effort has been made by the government to put us on permanent roll,” she added.Sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) AS Bain pacified them and assured them that all their demands would be forwarded to the state government, but they refused to lift their dharna.Meanwhile, the protesting staff also got the backing of the opposition party after the BJP leader Pravin Basal joined the protesters and sat with them on dharna.

Equipped with a smartphone and Aadhaar biometric system, he is delivering money at people’s doorstep.In Hisar division, which includes Sirsa, Fatehabad and Hisar districts, the postmen have so far delivered Rs 1.94 crore to people under the Aadhaar Enabled Payment System (AEPS), which was started by the government of India to facilitate seamless money transactions through unique identity number authentication.“As time changed and the emailing trend took over, postmen were completely forgotten. But after the Covid-19 lockdown was announced, they again started playing an important role in the society, this time by distributing money to those in need, but unable to go outside of the house,” said Anil Kumar Rose, superintendent of post offices, Hisar division.According to the data of Hisar zone, total 7,088 transactions have been carried out in these districts. Of this, 2,726 transactions have been made in Hisar district wherein the postmen have provided Rs 81 lakh to the residents till so far. In Sirsa, Rs 66 lakh were given to the people in 2,532 transactions, while postmen delivered Rs 47 lakh in 1,830 transactions in Fatehabad.Rose said, “The government of India had started India Post Payment Bank (IPPB) on September 1, 2018. Just after one year, AEPS was also launched. The main benefit of AEPS is that any customer, whose Aadhaar number is linked with his bank account, can withdraw his money from any post office using this facility.”He added that with the help of biometric devices, the postmen were facilitating money transactions and other financial services at the customer’s doorstep. The limit of withdrawal is different for each bank. “This facility is being used by over 7,000 people in the Hisar zone by staying safe in their homes and not having to visit ATMs or banks for cash withdrawals.He also said that though there are very nominal charges to withdraw money using this system, due to the lockdown the facility has been made totally free for everyone.There are two head post offices in the division, one in Sirsa and another in Hisar, 66 sub-post offices and 445 branches in these districts. Rose said that the postmen were also delivering money to widowed and old-age pensioners and farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/postmen-return-this-time-as-tech-enabled-bankers-providing-money-at-doorstep-in-haryana-s-hisar-division/story-ymevKoek0w5W0axd6Sg3HI.html

Amid the rising number of infections, the doubling rate in Chandigarh dipped to 4.7 days, from 30 days a week ago.Twelve new cases were reported from the congested Bapu Dham Colony in Sector 26, and one each from Sectors 15 and 30.In Bapu Dham Colony, which accounts for 37 cases so far, the chain of transmission was first detected when a 30-year-old operation theatre attendant of Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, who resides in the area, tested positive last Friday. The fresh cases are scattered over four households with six persons belonging to one household and remaining six to three different households.They include a 36-year-old woman and 12-year-old boy, who are community contacts of a positive person. Five males, aged 5, 9, 17, 30, 35, and a female, aged 27, who are family contacts of another confirmed case, have also been found infected. Also, three infected males, two of whom are aged 40 and one 17, are household contacts of another confirmed case. A two-year-old boy, who is a family contact of another patient, is among those tested positive from this colony.Also, a three-and-a-half-year-old child, who is a family contact of a positive case, has been found infected in Sector 30. A 67-year-old man from Sector 15, who was admitted to the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research’s emergency ward on May 30, has also tested positive. His source of infection is being investigated. His eight family contacts and 13 community contacts have been identified for isolation.Meanwhile, 65 more people have been identified for Covid-19 testing from Bapu Dham Colony. They will be sampled at Government Multi Specialty Hospital, Sector 16. Dr G Dewan, director, health services, said that 11,153 people in 2,541 households have been covered under house-to-house survey in the colony so far.Also, inmates of Aashreya, a permanent home for the orphaned, destitute, abandoned and differently abled persons in Sector 47, tested negative on Friday. They were tested after a sweeper working there tested positive a day earlier. In a worrisome trend in Chandigarh, out of every 14 people tested, one has been found to be Covid-19 positive. It translates to test positivity rate of 7.02%, much higher than the national average of 3.8%. According to data available till 5pm on Friday, out of every 25 people tested in India so far, only one person had tested positive. In all, 1,252 people have been tested in Chandigarh, of which 1,131 tested negative and 88 positive. Reports of the remaining suspected cases is awaited. HOME QUARANTINE OF PATIENTSMeanwhile, during the daily review meeting chaired by UT administrator VP Singh Badnore, it was decided that Covid-19 patients having no or mild symptoms wanting to stay at home instead of hospital will be allowed to do so, provided they have infrastructure for physical social distancing.Arun Kumar Gupta, principal secretary, health, said regular coordination meetings are taking place with all the medical institutes with regards to such developments. Doctors of various medical institutions again expressed their apprehension regarding patients from outside coming to Chandigarh for emergency cases without prior Covid-19 checking. The administrator has directed Gupta to prepare a list of such cases, so that the matter could be taken up with the neighbouring states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/14-new-covid-19-cases-in-chandigarh-12-of-them-are-from-hotspot-bapu-dham-colony/story-WUCOwgscEEdNBqklbGn8GL.html
02-05-2020||World||Italy’s coronavirus toll jumps after non-hospital deaths added in||Italy’s death toll jumped Saturday by the highest number since April 21, after previously uncounted deaths outside hospitals were added in.The 474 fatalities reported by the civil protection service took the Mediterranean country’s total since February to 28,710, second only to the United States.But the toll included 282 uncounted deaths in April that Milan’s Lombardy region said it had reported to the civil protection service on Saturday.The northern region recorded most of Italy’s initial deaths, and its toll now accounts for just under half of the country’s total.Italy’s real number of fatalities is believed to be substantially higher than the official figure because few deaths in care homes or in the community are reported.The elderly in care homes are often not tested for the virus, and the number of people who have died of the illness at home is unknown.Italy’s general trends two days before it begins gradually rolling back its lockdown on Monday were positive.The 192 new deaths were the lowest since March 14, and the number of new virus infections stood at 1,900, about a third of the number at the peak of the crisis.zak/ach||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italy-s-coronavirus-toll-jumps-after-non-hospital-deaths-added-in/story-yiCUHS24nyNvKH7gao2k5I.html
02-05-2020||World||Deaths due to coronavirus in UK mount to 28,131: Report||The UK on Saturday announced 621 more deaths in the coronavirus outbreak, taking the overall cumulative toll to 28,131, just behind Europe’s worst-hit country Italy.The government said that 182,260 people had tested positive for Covid-19, up 4,806 on Friday. But hospital admissions had fallen, it added.Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Thursday said the country had “past the peak” of the virus, as he comes under mounting pressure to ease lockdown restrictions imposed in late March.A review is expected this Thursday and Johnson said the government would outline a plan to lift social distancing measures that would keep transmissions rates down.“The very strong advice today is that moment has not yet come,” housing minister Robert Jenrick told a daily briefing on the government’s response to the outbreak.In the meantime, the public should remain at home except to shop for essential groceries, medicine or to exercise, he added.The government aims to keep transmission rates down by a wider testing regime, and also through contact tracing of people who have been in proximity with someone infected.Just under 106,000 tests were carried on Friday, Jenrick said.Britain was initially criticised for its light-touch approach to the growing pandemic but introduced stricter measures after scientists warned of mass casualties.The country’s overall death toll jumped mid-week after a change in reporting, by including deaths in all settings, including hospitals, care homes and the wider community.That saw numbers surge past Spain and France. It is now just behind Italy, which as of 1530 GMT on Saturday had 28,236 deaths, according to an AFP tally of official sources.The United States remains the worst-affected, with 65,173 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/deaths-due-to-coronavirus-in-uk-mount-to-28-131-report/story-QL1nPeUyXfHmyVi7WYhdjI.html
02-05-2020||World||Singapore to ease some coronavirus curbs over next few weeks||Singapore will start easing coronavirus restrictions over the next few weeks, authorities said on Saturday, as the city-state takes the first tentative steps towards reopening its economy.Businesses such as home-based enterprises, laundry services and barbershops will be allowed to reopen from May 12. A week later, some students will be allowed to go back to schools in small groups.Officials say workplaces will be allowed to reopen gradually, taking into account their importance to the economy and supply chains, as well as their ability to minimise the risk of infection.Singapore is facing the deepest recession in its 55-year history, compounded by so-called “circuit breaker” restrictions aimed at stemming the spread of the novel coronavirus that are due to last until June 1.“We are preparing for the safe and gradual resumption of economic and community activities after the end of the circuit breaker period on 1 June 2020,” the ministry of health said in a statement. Singapore has among the highest number of coronavirus infections in Asia, mainly due to outbreaks in cramped migrant-worker dormitories. It has managed to curb the spread of the disease among locals outside the dormitories. On Saturday, officials confirmed 447 new infections, the smallest daily rise in two weeks, taking the total to 17,548. It also reported the death of a 76-year-old man, taking the total death toll to 17.Of the new confirmed cases, 431 involve migrant workers living in dormitories and four are Singaporeans or permanent residents, the health ministry said.The average daily number of new cases outside the migrant worker dormitories has dropped by more than half to 12 in the past week, from 25 the week before, the ministry said on Friday.Authorities said SafeEntry, a digital check-in system to log details of visitors and employees, will be deployed extensively across the country to help with contact tracing.The government said the measures could still be adjusted depending on the situation, and that people should continue to stay at home and not meet in groups.“Even as we ease and adjust some of these measures, the bottom line is this - this is not the time to slacken and let our guard down,” Singapore minister Lawrence Wong, who co-heads the country’s virus fighting taskforce, told a media briefing. “We’re not out of the woods,” he said.

02-05-2020||World||In US, Ramadan amid Covid-19 crisis presents both obstacles, opportunities||For Muslims in the United States, there is no other time more centered around gathering in congregation than the holy month of Ramadan. In every corner of the country, believers attend community iftar meals to break the fast and then pack neatly into tight rows for nightly prayers at the mosque. On weekends, especially, some may linger longer as they catch up, share in the pre-dawn suhoor meal and line up again for the fajr, dawn, prayers.But this year, Ramadan falls during a global pandemic. In the US, with the world’s highest Covid-19 death toll, that means being forced to mark the month in different, more virtual and sometimes solitary ways.As they re-imagine some of the spiritual and social rituals, many are relying on a mix of at-home worship and a myriad of online religious programming. Virtual iftar options have sprung up so the devout don’t have to break their fast alone. But not all moments can be recreated on a screen. There will be dishes not shared, prayers not lifted together, hugs not given.Around the country, Muslims are adapting to the unprecedented challenges.HOUSTON: RICARDO RAMIREZ, 28Ricardo Ramirez became a Muslim before a crowd of believers.As soon as he uttered the shahada, the Islamic testimony of faith, the faithful broke into chants of “Allahu Akbar.” He was told that day that “all of these brothers and sisters are your brothers and sisters.”Since then, he says, the community has been there for him. But Ramirez is experiencing a milestone in his faith journey — his first Ramadan as a Muslim — as the virus disrupts worship and mosques close.“It’s going to be really difficult,” he said before Ramadan started. “I do have a lot of questions, and there’s a lot I want to observe and ask about.”Born in Texas to parents of Mexican descent, Ramirez was baptized Catholic before converting. In the compulsory solitude, he’s determined to find strength. “The more I think about it, I think this is the path that Allah has set for me as a challenge ... to know that this religion is for me.”CHICAGO: JUMANA AZAM, 33On Ramadan’s first day, respiratory therapist Jumana Azam slept through her alarm for suhoor. She had come home at 2 a.m. from an odd shift at the hospital. Still, when she woke up, she set her intention to fast, ignoring the doubts of whether she’d be able to keep it throughout the day.Then she changed back into scrubs and left to start another shift in the ICU of Rush University Medical Center.As Chicago experienced a surge of Covid-19 patients in early April, Azam’s days quickly turned into 16-hour shifts, with barely a break to eat or make one of the five daily prayers.Last year, Azam, like many other professional Muslims observing the month, decreased her working hours slightly to make the days more manageable. This year, she knows that won’t be possible. Still, Azam is planning to wake up each morning to eat before dawn and try.“I’m going to take it in stages and try to fast while I’m at work,” she says. “But if I feel like I’m getting light-headed, I’m going to have to break it.”NEW YORK CITY: IMAM MUFTI MOHAMMED ISMAIL, 38The An-Noor Cultural Center and masjid, or mosque, is located blocks from Elmhurst Hospital Center in Queens, where patients have been dying from Covid-19 at an alarming rate.The immigrant-rich neighborhood has been deemed one of New York City’s hardest-hit areas. Imam Mufti Mohammed Ismail is the principal of the religious school at An-Noor.A prayer of “protection from diseases” is printed in Arabic and English on a paper posted to the mosque wall, and Ismail says the Bangladeshi community has lost “close to 150 people” to Covid-19 across New York City.As deaths rise, Imam Ismail is trying to serve community members suffering in other ways. With mosques shuttered as the city reels, volunteers from An-Noor Cultural Center are preparing food boxes for those who would have relied on the center for iftar every evening.On this day, volunteers load food into a car and head off to begin deliveries. Imam Ismail says this gives the center the opportunity to fulfill one of Ramadan’s tenets — to serve those less fortunate, regardless of religion. “Once we receive a call asking for help, we never question about the caller’s faith. It’s just a family,” he says. “A human being. We are ready to serve them.”MINNEAPOLIS: IMAM SHARIF MOHAMEDFor all the things Muslims are doing without this year, one community in Minneapolis has gained a new voice during the holy month: the call to prayer.Throughout Ramadan, the azan, or adhan — which summons the faithful for prayers five times a day — will be broadcast over loudspeakers for the first time at the Dar Al-Hijrah Mosque.Mayor Jacob Frey facilitated the noise permit after community leaders requested the service. For Muslims feeling isolated at home, the sound of the azan will offer connection, says Imam Sharif Mohamed.“It’s calming and soothing for them,” he says. “The emotional and spiritual connection, I think, is beyond our imagination.”WHEELING, ILLINOIS: SHAHEEN KHAN, 54Over the last six weeks, Shaheen Khan has gotten more comfortable sitting in front of the camera and conducting online Islamic lessons.The 54-year-old mother of four teaches at the Hadi School, a Montessori Islamic school in Schaumburg, Illinois, that provides Islamic teachings according to the Shia tradition.Khan arrived in the US from India in 1990 and has been teaching ever since. But in 30 years, she’s never had to face the challenge of connecting with her students remotely day after day.Of the time at home, she says this: “Maybe this is Allah’s way of resetting a button for us.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-us-ramadan-amid-covid-19-crisis-presents-both-obstacles-opportunities/story-aGaoNkM5V1dnaprDvSxoRJ.html
02-05-2020||World||Donald Trump revises US Covid-19 toll estimate again to ‘hopefully under 100,000’||President Donald Trump on Friday revised the estimate of US fatalities from Covid-19 to “hopefully” less than 100,000, just days after he said he feared it could go up to 60,000 and then to 70,000. His first estimate based on projections by his coronavirus task force was up to 200,000.As of Saturday morning, US toll stood at 65,068, with 1,947 new fatalities in the last 24 hours and the number of confirmed cases had climbed to 1.1 million, with 34,037 new reported infections.The Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), whose projections are widely cited by public health officials and experts including member of the president’s task force on the coronavirus, has estimated 72,433 fatalities based on current levels of mitigation efforts.The American president has tried to get ahead of the pandemic, which he had once dismissed as something that will “disappear” like a “miracle”. Trump has also used these statements to claim credit for himself and his administration for acting in time and aggressively enough to have prevented many more death, even though US remains the nation which has recorded the highest death toll due to coronavirus, followed by Italy which is the second-hardest hit country. “Through our aggressive response and the remarkable commitment and bravery of American people, we have saved thousands and thousands of lives,” the president told reporters Friday before heading out to Camp David, the presidential retreat in adjoining Maryland state.He added: “People were thinking in terms of 1.5 million lives lost to 2.2 without the mitigation. And hopefully, we’re going to come in below that 100,000 lives lost, which is a horrible number nevertheless.”The estimate of 1.5 million to 2.2 million came from the White House task force on the coronavirus and was based on assumptions that the government did nothing to combat the outbreak. With all mitigation efforts fully in force, the task force had projected 120,000 to 200,000 deaths.To keep a tight control on its narrative on the handling of the outbreak, the White House has blocked Anthony Fauci, a top government epidemiologist and member of the coronavirus task force, from testifying before a congressional committee. It has said making key officials fighting the outbreak appear at hearings will be “counterproductive” at this point.But all projections have been significantly lowered with the enforcement of mitigation efforts such as stay-at-home orders and social-distancing guidelines.With continued drop in new cases, hospitalization and intubation, many states have started easing these restrictions. Texas became Friday the largest state to roll back some of the curbs. Stores, restaurants, movie theaters, malls, museums and libraries were allowed to reopen with limited occupancy to ensure social-distancing.Other states such as California and Michigan, which have been hit hard by the epidemic, are being more careful and have tightened restrictions. Beaches and some public parks have been closed in California indefinitely and Michigan has extended the lockdown to May 15 despite mounting protests.The situation in New York, the epicenter of the American epidemic with more than 24,000 fatalities, continues to improve but the scale of the devastation in the state and New York City, where close to 18,400 people have died thus far, has continued to unfold.A New York city nursing home on Friday reported the death of 98 inmates from Covid-19 over a period of time. “It’s absolutely horrifying,” Mayor Bill de Blasio has said. “It’s inestimable loss, and it’s just impossible to imagine so many people lost in one place.” Earlier in the week 100 bodies were found decomposing in two unrefrigerated trucks outside a funeral home in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-revises-covid-19-toll-estimate-again-to-hopefully-under-100-000/story-iJdlGbD4mmeJpnQre3SrUO.html

02-05-2020||World||UK PM Boris Johnson’s son named after doctors who ‘saved’ his life||Boris Johnson and his fiancée Carrie Symonds have named their newborn son Wilfred Lawrie Nicholas, partly as a tribute to two of the intensive care doctors who they said had saved the British leader’s life as he battled COVID-19 complications.Symonds announced the name on Saturday on Instagram beside a picture of her and the boy - who already has thick hair resembling the blond thatch of his father.Symonds, 32, said Wilfred, who was born on Wednesday, was named after Johnson’s grandfather while Lawrie came from her grandfather.Nicholas, Symonds said, was a nod to Nick Price and Nick Hart - two doctors who the couple have praised for saving Johnson’s life at St Thomas’ hospital last month.“I couldn’t be happier,” Symonds said, adding her thanks to the maternity staff of University College London Hospital. “My heart is full.”Johnson, 55, returned to work on Monday after recuperating from COVID-19, which had left him gravely ill in intensive care at the peak of the coronavirus outbreak. He thanked the doctors at St Thomas’ hospital whom, he said, had “saved my life, no question”.Symonds, a former public relations executive, also had symptoms of the virus but recovered more swiftly. She had said in February that the baby was due in early summer.Johnson, who was present at the birth, will take a short period of paternity leave later in the year.BABY IN DOWNING STREETSymonds and Johnson have been living together in Downing Street since he became prime minister in July. They announced in February they were expecting their first child and that they were engaged to be married.Once dubbed “Bonking Boris” by Britain’s tabloid media, Johnson has had a complicated private life.He was once sacked from the Conservative Party’s policy team while in opposition for lying about an extra-marital affair. He has been divorced twice and refuses to say how many children he has fathered.In 2013, when Johnson was mayor of London, appeal court judges ruled that the public had the right to know he had an extra-marital affair with a woman who gave birth to his daughter.Johnson’s previous marriage was to Marina Wheeler, a lawyer. They had four children together but announced in September 2018 that they had separated. They divorced earlier this year.Few British leaders have had babies while in office.David Cameron’s wife, Samantha, gave birth to their daughter, Florence, in 2010 and Tony Blair’s wife, Cherie, gave birth to their son, Leo, in 2006.Before that, Frances, the wife of John Russell, a 19th-Century Whig and Liberal politician, gave birth to two children in 1848 and 1849 while he was in office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-boris-johnson-s-son-named-after-doctors-who-saved-his-life/story-ifO8QVub7Sy6hgNNA8qF7L.html

Two criminal petitions were filed by lawyer Faisal Siddiqi on behalf of the parents—Ruth Pearl and Judie Pearl—against the acquittal and release of the four accused.“The decision by the Sindh High Court to free the men in the murder of Daniel Pearl is a complete miscarriage of justice. It is a defining case for the Pakistani state and its judicial system, involving freedom of the press, the sanctity of every life, freedom from terror and the manifestation of a welcoming and safe Pakistan to the world.

02-05-2020||World||US gives emergency-use authorization to Covid-19 treatment drug||The US drug regulator on Friday granted emergency use authorization for doctors to prescribe remdesivir, an antiviral medicine made by American pharmaceutical major Gilead Sciences Inc, for the treatment currently of hospitalized adults and children with severe coronavirus infection.The Food and Drug Administration, the regulator, said that though there is limited information available about the safety and effectiveness of the drug, it has been seen to shorten the recovery time in some patients.President Donald Trump announced with the emergency use authorization with a full-court briefing at the White House Friday accompanied by top officials of his coronavirus task force and the Gilead CEO Dan O’Day.The president called the drug the “hot thing” and “an important treatment for hospitalized coronavirus patients” and a “promising situation”.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe US drug regulator has said the emergency use authorization allows for remdesivir to be distributed in the US and administered intravenously by health care providers to treat suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in adults and children hospitalized with severe disease, which it defined as patients with low blood oxygen levels or needing oxygen therapy or more intensive breathing support such as a mechanical ventilator.The emergency use authorization was a much anticipated development after the president and the top US government epidemiologist declared positive outcome earlier in the week about form the clinical trial underway.Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreak“The data shows that remdesivir has a clear-cut, significant, positive effect in diminishing the time to recovery,” Anthony Fauci, the top epidemiologist and member of President Donald Trump’s coronavirus task-force told reporters, prefacing the announcement as “quite good news”.The trial, which was conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases that Fauci leads, showed “a drug can block the virus”, Fauci added and described it as “a new standard of care” for treating Covid-19.He had gone on to compare development to the trial 36 years ago in 1986 that led to the HIV antiviral AZT, a drug that had then shown only “modest” efficacy but became the base for better and more improved treatments over the years.Remdesivir is not a vaccine and cannot prevent Covid-19. It can treat Covid-19 better than any other drug around now||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-gives-emergency-use-authorization-to-covid-19-treatment-drug/story-QkN2fvKjstXELcIZWdVuZK.html

We have to be aware that it will be the start of an even bigger challenge,” Arcuri said.After a two-month shut down to combat a virus that has killed over 28,000 people, Italians will be allowed to stroll in parks and visit relatives. Restaurants can open for takeout and wholesale stores can resume business.Scientists will be closely monitoring the virus contagion rate as the lockdown lifts and Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has said it may be reintroduced in locally if the numbers begin to rise significantly again.Arcuri confirmed the “relative freedom” Italians were about to win could be taken away again for health reasons.“We must maintain social distancing, maximum hygiene levels, and masks. We’ve done our bit to the best of our ability. From Monday, it’s up to you,” he said at a press conference.“I implore you, do not lower your guards.”Some 150,000 people will have their blood tested next week for the new coronavirus as authorities attempt to get a clearer picture of its spread as the lockdown eases. Those tests were expected to begin Monday.Arcuri said the government had also bought over five million swabs to be distributed to the regions.Masks costing just 50 cents due to a cap set by the government would go on sale in 50,000 shops, from pharmacies to tobacconists, starting Monday. That figure would rise to 100,000 shops by mid month.Italy would be producing four million masks a day by mid June, 25 million by mid July and 35 million by mid August, Arcuri said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/it-s-up-to-you-italians-told-as-lockdown-end-nears/story-s4kiQxVODGEh5deRNkC0YK.html
02-05-2020||World||When lockdowns led Newton, Darwin, Milton to new highs||Millions across the globe are finding creative and not-so-creative ways to face the challenge of being hunkered down in homes, but there have been times when such periods of isolation and quarantine helped discover field-defining knowledge and create art.For example, Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin, John Milton and Lord Byron used the time to add to their formidable body of work in science and literature. It was not called ‘lockdown’ in their time, but they spent long spells in isolation, when medicine was not as developed as now.The University of Cambridge, where they studied, delved into its archives to collate their activities during such periods of isolation centuries ago. It has also asked its alumni to send accounts of how they are spending time in the coronavirus pandemic.Isaac Newton (Trinity College): Considered Trinity’s most accomplished alumni, he was also a poster-child for productivity during a pandemic. Like many in Cambridge during the Great Plague of 1665-6, he retreated to the countryside to escape the disease-ridden city and spent two extended periods at his family home in rural Lincolnshire, Woolsthorpe Manor.Newton thrived in isolation, and later described it as one of the most productive times in his life, finding the space to reflect on and develop his theories on optics, calculus, and the laws of motion and gravity. It was during this time that he conducted his famous prism experiment.“Probably to his parents’ displeasure, he bored a hole through his window shutters to produce a single, thin beam of light to pass through two prisms, proving for the first time that prisms did not create colours, but merely separated colours that were already there made up of a colour spectrum”, the university’s researcher Alisha Matthewson-Grand wrote.“Indeed, Newton was so intellectually transformed by his period of isolation that later commentators have referred to his time away from Cambridge as his annus mirabilis, or his ‘year of wonders’.”Charles Darwin (Christ’s College): Darwin’s experience with isolation was not the result of a pandemic but his own chronic ill health. He suffered from a myriad of unexplained symptoms, including vertigo, vomiting, cramps, fatigue, anxiety and visual disturbances.He noted in his autobiography of 1876 that “few persons can have lived a more retired life than we (Darwin and his wife Emma) have done. Besides short visits to the houses of relations, and occasionally to the seaside or elsewhere, we have gone nowhere.”Darwin believed that periods of isolation and ill health helped his career. At home, he was free from the demands placed on other scientists (teaching, administrative work), and thus able to devote himself entirely to research; he wrote: “Ill-health, though it has annihilated several years of my life, has saved me from the distractions of society and amusement.”Lord Byron (Trinity College): In 1811, Lord Byron was forced to quarantine in Malta after returning from a cholera-ravaged Greece. He was furious at the prospect of spending 40 days in lockdown, a measure he considered to be draconian and unnecessary.While confined, he wrote ‘Farewell to Malta’, a satirical poem attacking the island for (among other things) ‘its smoky towns and cloudy sky’ and its ‘cursed street of stairs’. He references his quarantine explicitly in the first verse ‘Adieu, thou damned’st quarantine, / That gave me fever, and the spleen!’.John Milton (Christ’s College): The author of ‘Paradise Lost’ and ‘Aeropagitica’ spent some time away from Cambridge as a first year undergraduate in 1626, when the town was hit by bubonic plague. He was home in London when he wrote ‘Elegia Prima’, his first Latin elegy. The work is an early example of his aptitude for verse composition, as well as his impressive comedic flair.A letter in verse form, the elegy was written for his closest friend Charles Diodati, and details how Milton was enjoying his unexpected period away from Cambridge while also anticipating his return to ‘the reedy fens of the Cam’ and ‘the hum of the noisy school.’||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/when-lockdowns-led-newton-darwin-milton-to-new-highs/story-IsrStGgbHHS3ZCdvILSfBJ.html

Swedish public broadcaster SVT said he had been registered since January at the Uppsala University, the Nordic region’s oldest university, studying Arabic language and acting as a lecturer.Hussain was openly critical of the Pakistani government, and the Swedish chapter of Reporters Without Borders had raised concerns that his disappearance could have been due to his work.In a statement published on Friday, the Balochistan Times said its staff was “deeply saddened by the demise of our dear friend and the founder of this magazine.”“As a journalist, he (Hussain) was compassionate and wrote extensively on the suffering of the Baloch people. His work often got him into trouble as the authorities did not like his reporting of Balochistan’s forbidden stories, the reason he had to leave and live in exile,” the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistani-journalist-who-reported-on-atrocities-in-balochistan-found-dead/story-CBlv8kNpsv8fwmWSUCK2aL.html

Britain’s welfare state and its National Health Service was set up after the Second World War.Henderson said that, as a result of the latest crisis, “many of those who work in the lowest-paid roles are in fact the key to our survival and these people who have been undervalued for so long have shown astonishing dedication when we have needed them the most.”Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicEton, founded in 1440 and England’s most exclusive school, has educated 20 British prime ministers, including Boris Johnson.Former pupils include Prince William and Prince Harry, respectively second and sixth in line to the British throne, as well as author George Orwell and economist John Maynard Keynes.For centuries seen as a bastion of privilege where rulers of the British empire were trained, the boarding school in 2020 has sought to cast itself as a champion of academic excellence while helping those less fortunate than most of its wealthy pupils. Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreakHenderson, who was educated at Winchester College, another elite school, said he wanted to challenge the notion that Eton was a byword for elitism.Eton will invest 100 million pounds ($125 million) over five years to help disadvantaged children in East Anglia, the Midlands and the north. The money will come from Eton’s charitable endowment and fundraising, The Times said.Henderson said Eton could be castigated in political debate about inequality likely to follow the outbreak. He also said the latest crisis hit poorest hardest and was widening inequalityy.With children stuck at home, he said the most vulnerable would “flatline or regress if they haven’t been in school for many months, are living in cramped homes and don’t have access to computers.”Opponents of Britain’s two-tier education system, where some parents spend small fortunes on on high-achieving, fee-paying schools, while most children attend state-funded schools of varying quality have called abolishing the charitable status of such fee-paying schools that gives such schools tax benefits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-shines-a-light-on-inequality-britain-s-elite-eton-college-says/story-QmaCkurNrZNcKv4H947PAJ.html

These funds will promote American foreign policy interests by supporting shorter-term mitigation efforts and addressing second-order impacts from the pandemic in the long term, across a variety of sectors.More than USD 130 million in humanitarian assistance from the Migration and Refugee Assistance (MRA) account, provided through the State Department’s Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration. These funds will help international organisations and NGO partners address challenges posed by the pandemic in refugee, IDP, and hosting communities as well as other migrants and other vulnerable people in both global and local humanitarian responses.This new assistance is in addition to the over USD 100 billion in global health funding and nearly USD 70 billion in overseas humanitarian assistance provided by the US in the last decade alone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-commits-over-775-million-to-assist-nations-combat-covid-19-report/story-s7uhGEWg8QDw8aK0JjRfdI.html
02-05-2020||World||Iran reports lowest coronavirus infections since March 10||Iran said Saturday there was a “clear drop” in the number of new coronavirus infections as it reported 802 fresh cases, the lowest daily count since March 10.The new cases brought to 96,448 the number recorded in Iran since it announced its first cases in mid-February.“This shows a clear drop in the number of new infections compared to recent weeks, despite our active testing,” health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said on state television.He added that 77,350 of those hospitalised have since been discharged, claiming it is a “one of the highest recovery percentages in the world.”New deaths from Covid-19 rose slightly to 65 in the past 24 hours, reaching a total of 6,156, Jahanpour said.Doubts have been cast over Iran’s coronavirus figures by experts and officials both at home and abroad.Iran’s deputy health minister Iraj Harirchi warned that the fall in the number of infections could quickly reverse.“I emphasise that this steady decline is fragile,” said Harirchi, who has himself recovered from COVID-19.“Carelessness in gatherings, reopening (businesses) and observing health protocols can make the country face serious problems again.”He also called on the government to increase health sector spending, which he said had been hit by fiscal pressures resulting from sweeping US sanctions and the global economic contraction sparked by the coronavirus.Iran has tried to contain the spread of the virus by shutting schools, universities, cinemas and stadiums among other public spaces since March.But it has allowed a phased reopening of its economy since April 11, and authorities are now mulling allowing sports, cultural and religious centres too.Tehran authorities, who have kept public transportation running despite warnings from health experts, made it mandatory for passengers to wear masks as of Saturday.The virus has not spared public figures, with at least 12 current or former government officials or lawmakers dead and more infected.One of the most senior -- parliament speaker Ali Larijani -- made his first public appearance in a month on Saturday, donning a protetive mask to attend a televised meeting alongside the president and the head of the judiciary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-reports-lowest-coronavirus-infections-since-march-10/story-eSVlOooySii8aaxs8dyrhN.html
02-05-2020||World||Islamic State attack kills 10 Iraqi fighters north of Baghdad||Ten Iraqi paramilitaries were killed in Islamic State group attacks north of Baghdad overnight, security forces said Saturday, the deadliest operation by jihadist sleeper cells in months.Iraq declared IS defeated in late 2017 but remnants of the group still wage hit-and-run attacks on security forces in remote areas of the north and west. Early Saturday, the jihadists attacked fighters of Iraq’s Hashed al-Shaabi paramilitary force stationed outside a town about 180 kilometres (110 miles) north of Baghdad, according to a statement by Iraq’s security forces.“Six fighters were killed. As another unit was dispatched to reinforce them, an explosive device detonated on that convoy and killed three fighters,” the statement said.A 10th fighter was killed in a separate IS attack on nearby unit from the Hashed, a network of armed groups incorporated into the regular army chain of command. A security source in Salahaddin province, where the attack took place, told AFP that the first IS ambush took place just before midnight. “All the Iraqi security forces manning the checkpoint were killed. F16 planes are flying overhead to search for the IS fighters,” the source said. The attack was IS’s deadliest in several months and appeared to cap a period of more numerous and aggressive operations.Last week, the jihadists claimed a suicide attack that wounded four outside an intelligence headquarters in the northern province of Kirkuk. “The group’s attacks have seemingly grown bolder over the past month or so, as it’s increasingly launched direct assaults on Iraqi security forces and carried out some daytime attacks,” Sam Heller, an independent analyst focused on IS and Iraq, told AFP. “Last night’s attack, if it was in fact coordinated between several IS units, would mark a new escalation by the group,” he added.IS overran around a third of Iraq in 2014, triggering the creation of both a US-led coalition to defeat the jihadists and the Hashed, comprised mostly of Shiite units with ties to Iran -- Iraq’s neighbour but a foe to Washington. The two forces are at odds in Iraq, as the US blames hardline Hashed factions for deadly rocket attacks on its troops while the Hashed and allied politicians have demanded US troops leave the country. In recent months, the coalition has pulled back from five bases where it had been deployed to help track down IS sleeper cells, saying the Iraqi military could largely finish the fight on their own.The coalition is still backing Iraqi troops with air strikes, intelligence and surveillance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/is-attack-kills-10-iraqi-fighters-north-of-baghdad/story-udkzt5UHxlOlJ4EDAAuF2N.html

02-05-2020||World||The art of re-emergence: Kim Jong Un appears after long gap||When North Korea broke a three-week silence on leader Kim Jong Un’s public activity on Saturday, it offered no clue where he has been during a period of intense global speculation about his health and whereabouts, or why he was hidden from the public for so long. Instead, state media simply showed him surrounded by aides and appearing confident at a gleaming fertiliser factory that is believed by outside experts to be part of a secret nuclear-weapons programme.While much remains a mystery about Kim’s condition, the abrupt re-emergence of the relaxed and smiling leader was clear choreography of key messages from the secretive government: Kim is the supreme leader in full control of a drive to improve the impoverished country’s food security and economy, amid tough international sanctions and the threat of the new coronavirus.CENTRE OF WORLD NEWSThe official Rodong Sinmun newspaper devoted three of its six pages on Saturday to touting Kim’s leadership, crediting him for what it called prosperity and self-reliance.Reuters could not verify the accuracy of official accounts or the authenticity of pictures from the event.The sprawling complex is the result of Kim’s vision to build a modern factory that will support agricultural production and make progress in automating its chemical industry, Pak Pong Ju, a party elder and a loyal aide to Kim, said at the ribbon-cutting where Kim reappeared.North Korea is under sanctions over its nuclear-weapons and missile programmes, leaving the country chronically struggling with food shortages, aggravated by bad weather and mismanagement.Also Read: Why North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s health mattersKim’s appearance at the Sunchon fertiliser plant, which official media said occurred on Friday, was an example of “field guidance” - a key part of Kim’s public persona, where he presides over an event at a major industrial or social project, or at other times at military drills involving strategic weapons such as ballistic missiles or tactical warfare.His second public visit this year to the site 50 km (30 miles) north of the capital Pyongyang included a sizeable audience of officials from the army, the ruling Workers’ Party and the local community. Many wore face masks in an apparent precaution against the coronavirus.“Agricultural production is a top priority, which has a direct impact on the lives of the people,” Koh Yu-hwan, the president of the Korea Institute for National Unification, a South Korean government think-tank, said. Koh said Kim’s sudden return was “a strategy to be in the centre of world news without resorting to nuclear or missile tests.”THE ENTOURAGEThe makeup of Kim’s entourage featured familiar faces at such events, including two at the forefront of the North’s years-long drive to improve economic conditions: former premier Pak Pong Ju, who is Kim’s deputy at the State Affairs Commission, and Pak’s successor as premier, Kim Jae Ryong.The pair had accompanied Kim on his last major field guidance, the March groundbreaking of the General Hospital in Pyongyang. To Kim Jong Un’s immediate right on the podium was his sister, Kim Yo Jong, a vice director of the party’s Central Committee and unofficially her brother’s chief of staff. SECRET PROJECTThe phosphate fertiliser factory in Sunchon, under construction since June 2017, has received much attention from North Korea’s leaders, with multiple visits by Kim Jae Ryong and Pak. International observers say the plant is part of the North’s clandestine pursuit of uranium extraction for use in nuclear weapons, as the mineral can be a byproduct of making phosphate fertiliser. Also Read: North Korea’s Kim Jong Un makes first appearance in nearly three weeks: ReportThere is strong evidence the factory is involved in uranium extraction, said a report this month by the Center for Nonproliferation Studies, based in California, in line with Kim’s policy of pursuing economic and military strength.The North is motivated to use the plant because it is cost-effective and can easily conceal uranium enrichment, which Pyongyang has long sought to hide, the report said. Uranium enrichment offers an alternative to plutonium processing as a fuel for nuclear weapons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/the-art-of-re-emergence-kim-jong-un-appears-after-long-gap/story-we0v9Y5tPwr6EeRcjrPREJ.html

Spaniards get outside to exercise after 49 days of lockdown||Joggers and cyclists across Spain emerged from their homes early on Saturday, with adults allowed out for exercise for the first time in seven weeks as the government began easing coronavirus restrictions.In Barcelona, runners and cyclists crowded paths near the beach, while surfers and paddle-boarders were out enjoying the waves.Mar Visser, 45, who lost her job as an events organiser, was jogging along the path in Castelldefels, a town near Barcelona. “I have been longing for this. It beats running in my house or doing yoga or Pilates inside,” she said. In Madrid, cyclists and skateboarders streamed along the city’s wide boulevards, ducking under police tape set up to prevent people congregating in common areas. Hit by one of the world’s worst Covid-19 outbreaks, Spain imposed a strict lockdown in March, confining most of the population to their homes for all but essential trips.Sports and recreational walks were banned as authorities scrambled to stop the disease from spreading and ease the burden on the stricken healthcare system. Charlotte Fraser-Prynne, 41, a British government affairs consultant, was among the first to savour the new freedom to exercise - out for a run at 6 a.m. near the city’s Retiro Park.While the park remained closed, hundreds of people were running on the pavement around it.“I have been looking forward to this for weeks. I was joking with my friends that I would be the first out in Madrid. I am very happy to be out after six weeks of yoga videos,” she said.As the rate of infection has fallen and hospitals have regained their footing, the government has shifted its focus towards reopening the country and reviving the economy.Last weekend, children under 14 were allowed out for an hour a day of supervised activity.On Tuesday Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez announced a four-phase plan to return the country to what he termed “the new normality” by the end of June.To avoid overcrowding as people get outside, the government has implemented a shift system, allocating different time slots to different age groups. Businesses that operate by appointment, such as hairdressers, will be allowed to open from Monday. Bars and restaurants will remain closed for at least another week.Spain has recorded a death toll of 24,824 from the illness, and more than 215,000 cases. The lockdown has hammered the economy and the government expects gross domestic product (GDP) to contract 9.2% in 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/free-at-last-spaniards-get-outside-to-exercise-after-49-days-of-lockdown/story-cqlK5ei3LOB9BTz3UzIQNM.html

It also criticized the timing of the US comments as the world tries to deal with the coronavirus pandemic.The US mission said barring Taiwan from the UN was an affront to the international body’s founding principles promoting human freedom and providing a forum welcoming diverse views.US President Donald Trump is escalating efforts to blame China for the Covid-19 pandemic and is exploring ways to hold Beijing accountable. He and his aides have sharpened their criticism of China, hinting at possible retaliation through tariffs. On Monday, a top US health official spoke with his Taiwan counterpart on giving the island a bigger role in the virus fight.“The Chinese Mission hereby expresses strong indignation and firm opposition,” it said in the statement. “The government of the People’s Republic China is the sole legal government representing the whole of China, and Taiwan is an inalienable part of China,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-opposes-taiwan-participation-in-un-after-us-tweet/story-Eg4xWd6OUm0NNPBLtRbOLK.html
02-05-2020||World||Kim Jong Un reminds world of nuclear threat at fertilizer plant||The place North Korean leader Kim Jong Un visited may be just as significant as showing his face in public after a three-week absence that raised questions about his health and control of the nuclear-armed state.State media on Saturday said Kim celebrated the completion of the Sunchon Phosphatic Fertilizer Factory north of Pyongyang, the capital. Although the inspection tour itself appeared routine, the facility has been the subject of high-level attention for years due to its dual-use potential: North Korea could possibly tap it to increase production of both food and nuclear weapons.“The DPRK does need fertilizer, and the information on how to extract uranium in the midst of that process is readily available,” Margaret Croy, a research associate at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, said in a research paper published last month.It said the fertilizer plant offers Kim the opportunity to help boost the state’s flagging economy by helping agricultural production and can aid in uranium extraction from phosphoric acid, allowing North Korea to conceal its nuclear activities from the outside world.“The implication of such work being conducted in the DPRK is clear: it has the potential to considerably alter open-source estimates of how much yellowcake uranium the DPRK is able to produce annually, which in turn affects estimates of how many nuclear warheads the DPRK can make,” Croy wrote.Under Kim’s leadership, North Korea has made a sharp inward turn to develop its nuclear and missile programs, relying as much as it can on domestic technology and material to advance its weapons under tightened global sanctions designed to prevent it from acquiring the key components needed to realize its atomic ambitions.Kim visited the plant in January, and satellite imagery shows that it has grown considerably since a groundbreaking ceremony in 2017. Two of Kim’s top officials visited it several times over the past three years as construction proceeded, according to state media reports.Croy’s paper didn’t offer proof that the plant was a part of North Korea’s nuclear program, and some other analysts were skeptical.“Theoretically, the fertilizer factory can be used to produce yellowcake, but why would the North do that when it already can produce something more advanced than that?” said Cho Han-bum, a senior research fellow at the Korea Institute for National Unification.North Korea has ample deposits of uranium, and informed the International Atomic Energy Agency in 1992 that it has two mines and two processing plants, which have been closely watched since then. It later informed the IAEA that it has one plant to enrich uranium for weapons, but outside experts believe it has several more.Soviet, Chinese HelpThe Kim family for decades had relied on the outside world to get it started on nuclear materials and missiles to deliver them, seeking help from its former sponsor the Soviet Union and its current biggest benefactor China. It used to import weapons from abroad and develop them into their own systems.But over the years, global sanctions have made it more difficult to rely on others and spy satellites have been keeping a closer eye on its weapons program.The nuclear program has largely been self-sufficient for decades. It used to turn out enough plutonium for one nuclear bomb a year, and now relies mainly on uranium enrichment. According to weapons experts, North Korea produces enough fissile material for about six bombs a year.‘Greatly Pleased’“Pyongyang needs to have most of the supply chain for the production of nuclear warheads and missiles indigenized -- and by all accounts it appears to have largely done so,” said Ankit Panda, a weapons expert who is an adjunct senior fellow at the Federation of American Scientists.He added there are still some components thought to be sourced from overseas, though North Korea has shown it “has the industrial capacity to build missile airframes, solid and liquid propellants, and even missile engines.”Under Kim, weapons experts said North Korea developed a hydrogen bomb and an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of delivering a warhead to all of the U.S., its main adversary. He has made his nuclear and rocket scientists national heroes, and -- after tests in 2017 -- rewarded many of them with luxury apartments in Pyongyang.During his visit to the fertilizer factory on May 1, Kim said the project demonstrated the country’s commitment to “self-reliance,” according to the official Korean Central News Agency. He added that his father and grandfather would be “greatly pleased.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-reminds-world-of-nuclear-threat-at-fertilizer-plant/story-wwlfhzxwetsy3kYzj6Q3VJ.html
02-05-2020||World||Amid climbing ban, China’s team at Mt Everest to measure world’s tallest peak||China has sent a team of scientists and surveyors to Mount Everest to measure the world’s tallest peak amid ongoing ban on climbing because of the Covid-19 pandemic.The new measurement of the mountain could resolve the question whether Mount Everest lost some of its height in the magnitude 8.1 earthquake in 2015 that ravaged Nepal.The project was made public last week on the same day as telecom giant Huawei and China Mobile, the world’s largest mobile operator, announced that they had installed 5G antennas at the mountain’s advance base camp at a height of 6,500 metres and at the lower base camp, at 5300 metres and at 5800 metres to help the survey.A China Mobile technician told state media that the new network is fast enough for climbers and scientists to have 4K and VR live streaming on the mountain.The most-accepted elevation of the mountain, which straddles Nepal and China, is 8848 metres or 20,029 feet confirmed after an Indian expedition in 1955.Beijing and Kathmandu have differed on whether to include the mountain’s snow-capped peak as part of its altitude with the latter favouring it.The new expedition is expected to update the state of the mountain, which isknown as Sagarmatha in Nepal and Qomolangma in China and in the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR).The official news agency Xinhua said earlier this week that a 53-member team from the ministry of national resources (MNR) is conducting preliminary scientific work since early March and survey work on the mountain is due to begin this month.“The measurement team, consisting of members from the MNR and the national mountaineering team, has arrived at the base camp of the peak for training on mountain climbing and surveying skills in the high-altitude region, making preparation for the measurement planned in May,” the Xinhua report added.Besides MNR, the mission is being organised by the foreign ministry, the General Administration of Sport and the TAR government.Li Guopeng, the MNR team leader, said the Chinese BeiDou Navigation Satellite System and homegrown surveying equipment will be applied to the measurement.The team will use aerial gravity measurement to improve the accuracy, and the three-dimensional technology will provide a visual demonstration of the natural resources of Qomolangma, Li said, adding that the measurement team will climb to the summit to obtain reliable data.According to Beijing, the mountain is recognised as a symbol of the friendship between Nepal and China.According to a joint statement signed between the two countries last October after President Xi Jinping’s visit, the two sides will promote cooperation in different fields, including addressing climate change and protecting the environment, and jointly announce the height of Mount Qomolangma and conduct scientific researches.“Since the founding of the People’s Republic of China in 1949, Chinese surveyors have conducted six rounds of scaled measurement and scientific research on Mount Qomolangma and released the height of the peak twice in 1975 and 2005, which was 8,848.13 meters and 8,844.43 meters respectively.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-climbing-ban-china-s-team-at-mt-everest-to-measure-world-s-tallest-peak/story-cIShTPZzv1rVwGtxl1kHGP.html
02-05-2020||World||Face mask, white stick: Do Kim Jong Un’s photos hold clues of his 20-day absence?||Kim Jong Un’s first public appearance in almost three weeks sent analysts poring over the few photos released by North Korean media for clues about his mysterious absence.Propaganda reports Saturday about Kim’s visit to a fertilizer factory northeast of Pyongyang didn’t make the slightest allusion to the global speculation about his health in recent weeks. That left observers to glean what they could from visual cues about the supreme leader’s appearance, entourage and surroundings.Here are some things they noticed:1. Kim’s AppearanceKim, 36, who has gained considerable weight since taking power in 2011, didn’t show any obvious sign of the sort of weight-loss that might follow a serious health scare. He was wearing a Mao suit and sporting what looked like a fresh hair cut.Speculation about Kim’s whereabouts had mounted since his unprecedented absence from annual events to celebrate the April 15 birthday of his grandfather, state founder Kim Il Sung. U.S. officials said they were told Kim was in critical condition after undergoing a cardiovascular procedure. He was last seen in state media on April 12.Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, quipped on Twitter: “Well, I wouldn’t say Kim looks healthy, but he definitely doesn’t look dead.” One user with the handle @MaryMaryQ3 agreed, replying “Ashy and bloated.”2. His EntourageKim’s younger sister, Kim Yo Jong, was among those standing closest to the leader in several photographs from the Sunchon Phosphatic Fertilizer Factory visit. Such proximity is often used by North Korean propaganda organs to indicate the leader’s favor and might show that the worldwide discussion about her taking his place hadn’t damaged her standing.Kim Yo Jong, 30, also appeared to be wearing a makeup and a hair band -- both new additions according to Jeongmin Kim, a correspondent with the Seoul-based NK News website. The change in appearance could suggest she was aware of her new, higher profile.3. Face MaskAt least one member of Kim’s entourage could be seen wearing a face mask, keeping alive speculation that Covid-19 is still concern in North Korea. The Seoul-based JoongAng Daily newspaper reported last week that the North Korean leader had been in self-quarantine after one of his bodyguards was confirmed with the coronavirus infection.North Korea closed its borders shortly after China acknowledged the risk of human-to-human transmission in January and cases surged. Kim’s regime has said it has no confirmed infections from the virus.4. Golf CartA green golf cart pictured behind Kim also caught analysts’ attention. It’s similar to one seen when Kim returned from an almost six-week absence in October 2014, walking with a cane and facing speculation that he was battling gout.On the other hand, the factory site looks extensive and anyone might need a cart to get around. Kim used a similar vehicle to give Chinese President Xi Jinping a tour during his visit last year to Pyongyang.5. White StickThe same photo shows one official holding a slender white stick, initially thought by some to be a cane. It was seen in another picture being used as a pointer in a presentation about the plant.The development of the factory itself has been closely watched in open-source satellite analysis for years. The plant is suspected of having a dual-use capability that would help North Korea produce yellow cake uranium for its weapons.North Korea has a history of altering photos and obscuring key details related to its military, knowing that specialists will use sophisticated software and visual clues to locate events and parse details about the performance of its latest weapons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/face-mask-white-stick-do-kim-jong-un-s-photos-hold-clues-to-his-20-day-absence/story-8PiQmagfd91FQWIqsO0RFL.html
02-05-2020||World||Why North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s health matters||Nearly three weeks after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s no-show at a key event sparked rumours he was seriously ill or even dead, state media published photos Saturday showing him in public.Kim’s conspicuous absence from the April 15 celebrations for the birthday of his grandfather, the North’s founder, sparked feverish speculation over his health and who would replace him at the helm of the nuclear-armed country.It is not the first time Kim has disappeared from public view. In 2014, he dropped out of sight for nearly six weeks before reappearing with a cane. Days later, South Korea’s spy agency said he had undergone surgery to remove a cyst from his ankle.Here is a look at why Kim’s health has been the subject of so much conjecture.Who is his successor? Kim has been in power for nearly a decade and his death would have left Pyongyang facing an unplanned succession for the first time in its history.Leadership has always been a family affair in the isolated North, dominated by the members of the “Paektu bloodline” -- a Northern term for the country’s founder Kim Il Sung and his descendants.Kim’s three known children are still very young and there is no designated successor as far as the world is aware.His younger sister Yo Jong -- one of his closest advisers -- is widely regarded as the top contender to succeed him but the North is a highly patriarchal society where seniority and gender both carry weight.What happens to nuclear talks?Kim is known in the North as the Supreme Leader and his authority spans the ruling Workers’ Party and the military. All major decisions require his approval. Kim’s disappearance from public view came as Pyongyang’s talks with Washington over the North’s nuclear arsenal are at a standstill, despite three meetings between Kim and US President Donald Trump. If Kim were incapacitated or dead, it would have increased uncertainty over the process.The worst scenarios, according to some analysts, would involve power struggles and refugee flows to China.Kim is also obese and both his father and grandfather are believed to have died of heart diseases.“Kim’s personal profile, family history, and the structure of the North Korean regime make his health a major variable for the country’s stability and foreign policy,” Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul, told AFP.Why so many rumours? North Korea is an unusually opaque country, where even economic growth figures are treated as a state secret. Observers and even diplomats in Pyongyang rely heavily on the closely controlled state media for hints of what is going on. Secrecy is strictest of all around the leadership and the absence of information creates ample room for speculation to flourish unchecked.Kim was last seen presiding over a ruling party meeting on April 11. But four days later he missed the celebrations for the birthday of his grandfather -- the most important date in the North’s political calendar -- sparking questions over his whereabouts.Daily NK, a South Korea-based outlet run mostly by North Korean defectors, reported Kim had undergone a cardiovascular procedure and was recovering at a villa in North Pyongan province.Soon afterwards CNN reported that Washington was “monitoring intelligence” that Kim was in “grave danger” after undergoing surgery, quoting an anonymous US official. A Japanese report even said he was in a “vegetative state”.But a top security adviser to South Korea’s president later told the US broadcaster Kim was “alive and well”. Trump also downplayed reports of Kim’s poor health and possible demise.“This incident is a reminder of how vulnerable we remain to groundless rumours about North Korea,” former US government North Korea analyst Rachel Lee told AFP.“We need more experts who can analyse North Korea using solid tradecraft.”Analysts say Kim is likely to make another public appearance in the coming days that will be reported by state media. But an official explanation for his absence is unlikely.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/why-north-korean-leader-kim-jong-un-s-health-matters/story-QZ6kcx6hDcqVWdYymyPYFK.html
02-05-2020||World||Canada’s economy is in recession due to Covid-19 impact: Report||A leading Canadian think tank has projected that the country’s economy is now in recession thanks to the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.The Toronto-based C D Howe Institute’s Business Cycle Council made this official even as it stated that the first quarter of 2020 was historic in the sense that the country recorded its highest ever drop in GDP, at a 2.6 per cent fall. Statistics Canada has estimated that Canada’s GDP took a nine per cent hit in March alone, as the economic impact of the coronavirus crisis rattled the economy with several sectors being shut down. March also saw a 5.3 per cent drop in employment in the nation.Click here for Covid-19 coverageThe Council’s decision to declare a recession was based on preliminary data available on April 30 and it stated that while revisions to GDP figures will occur, they are “extremely unlikely to be significant enough to alter the recession call.”This sobering announcement came as the country recorded over 55,000 Covid-19 cases with 3,391 deaths.Already, nearly seven million Canadians, approximately a fifth of the country’s population, have availed of an emergency fund established by the Government to counter the adverse economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. A note published by the Parliamentary Budget Office estimated that total could increase by 20 per cent, to about 8.5 million using the Canada Emergency Response Benefit, which was announced by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and is scheduled to last four months, beginning with March.Click here for Covid-19 updatesWith a subsidy programme also being introduced to support businesses in retaining employees, the budget deficit will go over CA$ 252 billion. Decisions on how the Government will deal with the looming economic crisis have yet to be made, and Trudeau made it clear that facing the current challenges caused by Covid-19 will remain the priority for the short-term. Right now, he said during a media briefing after a session of Parliament, the “focus is on getting through this together as a country.”“There will be time after this is all done as we figure out how exactly this unfolds, where we will have to make next decisions on how that recovery looks,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-s-economy-is-in-recession-due-to-covid-19-impact-report/story-MVTDtLRvjy7RLUPlwkqKOO.html

The American India Foundation (AIF) said it has tied up with the World Central Kitchen (WCK) for organising the meals. “As the impact of Covid-19 continues to evolve, frontline healthcare workers in both the US and in India are serving an important role in the fight against the pandemic, requiring our support now more than ever,” said AIF CEO Nishant Pandey. This collaboration is the latest as part of the AIF’s Covid-19 Response through which it is serving more than 1,00,000 vulnerable people -- including migrant workers in India -- from the economic and social fallout. “AIF is happy to be teaming up with WCK to provide daily meals to hospitals, and long-term care facilities throughout New York City, Bay Area, Boston and Chicago. Through this initiative, we want to show our gratitude towards the frontline health workers in the US,” he said. This partnership will also help the local economy and jobs by supporting local kitchens and restaurants, Pandey said. World Central Kitchen, an international not-for-profit organisation founded by chef José Andrés, provides food to communities in times of crisis. “To provide meals for the tireless and brave medical professionals working on the front lines of this crisis, as well as to meal centers who need assistance more than ever, is truly an honour,” said Nate Mook, CEO of World Central Kitchen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-american-ngo-to-provide-20-000-meals-to-frontline-health-workers-in-nyc/story-wxaU7IaT9VmUDrXFSNlHEK.html

It’s certainly an option,” Trump said but did not give a timeline for this.“We’re going to see what happens. A lot of things are happening with respect to China. We’re not happy, obviously, with what happened. This is a bad situation all over the world, 182 countries. But we’ll be having a lot to say about that,” he said in response to a question.In an interview to Buck Sexton of The Buck Sexton Show, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accused China of being non transparent on the issue of coronavirus.“They’ve claimed that they have been transparent, but of course, at least as of a day or two ago, we still didn’t actually have a sample of the virus. We were still working to try to understand what the scope of the risk was,” he said.Pompeo said China claimed it didn’t know where the coronavirus came from, but those inside China, who tried to talk about the virus, were denied access.They were told “don’t talk about that, stop it” and discussions were banned early on, he added.“That’s not the way partners work, reliable partners work. Reliable partners share. They open up, especially when there’s trouble. They go overboard to make sure everybody can understand how it came to be. That’s all we’ve asked for,” the secretary of state said.“We hope that the Chinese Communist Party will see their way clear to allow the world to understand how the heck this virus got out of Wuhan, China, and spread all across the world,” he said.“We need responsibility and accountability for this outbreak,” Pompeo said.He said it was really important to understand what happened in China during the virus outbreak to make sure something like this does not happen again.“There are multiple labs inside of China and our understanding of what takes place there is pretty limited, and there have been examples of leaks from those labs before,” Pompeo said. He said the coronavirus pandemic has been an expensive and costly calamity and the US needs to do its part but there is a responsibility on Chinese Communist Party to make sure something like this does not happen again. “We have seen the narrative which is that this virus began and the Chinese Communist Party knew about it, didn’t alert the world to it in a timely fashion,” Pompeo said.He further said the whole world world has a right to know what happened in China during the coronavirus outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tariff-on-china-for-mishandling-coronavirus-outbreak-certainly-an-option-says-trump/story-gZ7jf8dnULuIVmojUfcH5K.html

The Washington Post first reported that Fauci would not testify.Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has been one of the leading medical experts helping to guide the U.S. response to the highly contagious virus that has swept across the United States.Trump has repeatedly clashed with the Democratic-controlled House over its moves to investigate his actions or those of his administration.In recent days, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer have urged wide-ranging investigations into Trump’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak, which has killed tens of thousands of Americans.Democrats have criticized Trump, saying he has failed to develop a comprehensive and effective plan for testing Americans for the coronavirus and tracing contacts of those who are infected by the virus that causes the sometimes fatal COVID-19 respiratory disease.Fauci, 79, has had a respectful but sometimes complicated relationship with Trump.The well-regarded doctor has at times corrected or contradicted the president at White House briefings or in press interviews on issues such as the time required to develop a vaccine and the likelihood that the coronavirus will return in the fall.Trump has occasionally shown exasperation with Fauci but ultimately has followed, largely, the advice that he and Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House’s coronavirus task force coordinator, have provided on responding to the pandemic.Last month, the White House said Trump was not firing Fauci despite his retweet of a supporter’s #FireFauci message.At the time, White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said: “Dr. Fauci has been and remains a trusted adviser to President Trump.”Aides to Fauci were not immediately available to comment on the House committee’s desire to have him testify.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-blocks-anthony-fauci-from-testifying-to-congress-on-coronavirus-response/story-6ilngFO7HRmugOTmik5hyI.html
02-05-2020||World||US government missed some chances to slow coronavirus spread: Health official||The U.S. government was slow to understand how much coronavirus was spreading from Europe, which helped drive the acceleration of outbreaks across the nation, a top health official said Friday.Limited testing and delayed travel alerts for areas outside China contributed to the jump in U.S. cases starting in late February, said Dr. Anne Schuchat, the No. 2 official at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.“We clearly didn’t recognize the full importations that were happening,” Schuchat told The Associated Press.The coronavirus was first reported late last year in China, the initial epicenter of the global pandemic. But the U.S. has since become the hardest-hit nation, with about a third of the world’s reported cases and more than a quarter of the deaths.The CDC on Friday published an article, authored by Schuchat, that looked back on the U.S. response, recapping some of the major decisions and events of the last few months. It suggests the nation’s top public health agency missed opportunities to slow the spread. Some public health experts saw it as important assessment by one of the nation’s most respected public health doctors.The CDC is responsible for the recognition, tracking and prevention of just such a disease. But the agency has had a low profile during this pandemic, with White House officials controlling communications and leading most press briefings.“The degree to which CDC’s public presence has been so diminished ... is one of the most striking and frankly puzzling aspects of the federal government’s response,” said Jason Schwartz, assistant professor of health policy at the Yale School of Public Health.President Donald Trump has repeatedly celebrated a federal decision, announced on Jan. 31, to stop entry into the U.S. of any foreign nationals who had traveled to China in the previous 14 days. That took effect Feb. 2. China had imposed its own travel restrictions earlier, and travel out of its outbreak areas did indeed drop dramatically.But in her article, Schuchat noted that nearly 2 million travelers arrived in the U.S. from Italy and other European countries during February. The U.S. government didn’t block travel from there until March 11.“The extensive travel from Europe, once Europe was having outbreaks, really accelerated our importations and the rapid spread,” she told the AP. ”I think the timing of our travel alerts should have been earlier.”She also noted in the article that more than 100 people who had been on nine separate Nile River cruises during February and early March had come to the U.S. and tested positive for the virus, nearly doubling the number of known U.S. cases at that time.The article is carefully worded, but Schwartz saw it as a notable departure from the White House narrative.“This report seems to challenge the idea that the China travel ban in late January was instrumental in changing the trajectory of this pandemic in the United States,” he said.In the article, Schuchat also noted the explosive effect of some late February mass gatherings, including a scientific meeting in Boston, the Mardis Gras celebration in New Orleans and a funeral in Albany, Georgia. The gatherings spawned many cases, and led to decisions in mid-March to restrict crowds.Asked about that during the interview, Schuchat said: “I think in retrospect, taking action earlier could have delayed further amplification (of the U.S. outbreak), or delayed the speed of it.”But she also noted there was an evolving public understanding of just how bad things were, as well as a change in what kind of measures — including stay-at-home orders — people were willing to accept.“I think that people’s willingness to accept the mitigation is unfortunately greater once they see the harm the virus can do,” she said. “There will be debates about should we have started much sooner, or did we go too far too fast.”Schuchat’s article still leaves a lot of questions unanswered, said Dr. Howard Markel, a public health historian at the University of Michigan.It doesn’t reveal what kind of proposals were made, and perhaps ignored, during the critical period before U.S. cases began to take off in late February, he said.“I want to know ... the conversations, the memos the presidential edicts,” said Markel, who’s written history books on past pandemics. “Because I still believe this did not need to be as bad as it turned out.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-government-missed-some-chances-to-slow-coronavirus-spread-health-official/story-gTgFAdT0FAlHogo5ZjyfuK.html
02-05-2020||World||‘Like I just got out of jail!’: Over a dozen US states ease Covid-19 lockdowns||More than a dozen US states let restaurants, stores or other businesses reopen Friday in the biggest one-day push yet to get their economies up and running again, acting at their own speed and with their own quirks and restrictions to make sure the coronavirus doesn’t come storming back.People in Louisiana could eat at restaurants again but had to sit outside at tables 10 feet (3 meters) apart with no waiter service. Maine residents could attend church services as long as they stayed in their cars. And a Nebraska mall reopened with plexiglass barriers and hand-sanitizing stations but few shoppers.“I feel like I just got out of jail!” accountant Joy Palermo exclaimed as she sat down with a bacon-garnished bloody Mary at the Gretna Depot Cafe outside New Orleans.Meanwhile, the first drug shown to help fight COVID-19 won emergency approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. In a major study, remdesivir shortened patients’ recovery time from 15 days to 11 on average and may have also reduced deaths.The virus has killed more than 230,000 people worldwide, including over 64,000 in the U.S. and more than 20,000 each in Italy, Britain, France and Spain, forcing lockdowns that have shuttered factories and businesses, thrown tens of millions out of work and throttled the world’s economies.President Donald Trump said Friday that he’s hoping the total number of COVID-19 deaths in the United States will be below 100,000, which he acknowledged is a “horrible number.” Trump’s predictions of the expected U.S. death toll have changed over time, with his earlier 60,000 projection now being eclipsed. But he said at a White House event that “maybe millions of lives” have been saved by shutting down the economy.With the crisis stabilizing in Europe and in many places in the U.S., countries and states are gradually easing their restrictions amid warnings from health experts that a second wave of infections could hit unless testing for the virus is expanded dramatically.In much of Colorado, people could get their hair cut and shop at stores again, though stay-at-home orders remained in place in Denver and surrounding counties. Wyoming let barbershops, nail salons, gyms and daycare centers reopen. In Maine, golf courses, hairdressers and dentists opened.Hotels near South Carolina beaches opened and state parks unlocked their gates for the first time in more than a month. But in Myrtle Beach, the state’s most popular tourist destination, hotel elevators will be restricted to one person or one family — a potential inconvenience at the area’s 15- and 20-story resorts.Texas’ reopening got underway with sparse crowds at shopping malls and restaurants allowing customers to dine in, though only at 25% capacity in most places. A video posted on social media showed a city park ranger in Austin getting shoved into the water Thursday while asking people in a crowd to keep 6 feet (2 meters) apart from each other. Police charged a 25-year-old man with attempted assault.At Gattuso’s Restaurant in Gretna, Louisiana, Kent and Doris Alimia and their daughters, Molly and Emily, celebrated Molly Alimia’s 22nd birthday at one of the outdoor tables, which were screened by plants in wooden planters 5 feet high.“It’s a nice change of scenery to actually get out of the house,” Molly Alimia said.Outside Omaha, Nebraska, Jasmine Ramos was among a half-dozen shoppers wandering the open-air Nebraska Crossing mall. Most wore masks.“I do think it’s a little soon, but it’s kind of slow and there aren’t a lot of people here, so I’m not too worried,” Ramos said.Restrictions were still in place in Arizona, but warnings from police and health officials didn’t stop Debbie Thompson from serving food Friday inside her Horseshoe Cafe in Wickenburg, a town of 6,300 people about 65 miles (105 kilometers) west of Phoenix. Cheered on by a few customers, Thompson was not arrested, but she later received a call from the state Department of Health Services telling her to stop violating Gov. Doug Ducey’s stay-at-home order.Around the country, protesters have demanded governors reboot the battered economy. More than 100 people chanted and carried signs in front of Chicago’s Thompson Center, where Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker has an office, to call for an end to the statewide lockdown.Pritzker has said he will not lift his order until it’s safe, and several counterprotesters expressed support for his position. Nurse anesthetist Benjamin Salazar held up a sign that read, “Stay home. We are getting tired of seeing people die.”New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham invoked the state’s Riot Control Act as she sealed off all roads to nonessential traffic in the city of Gallup, population 70,000, to help control a surging coronavirus outbreak in the former trading post on the outskirts of the Navajo reservation.“In the hardest-hit corner of the U.S., New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said schools and colleges will remain closed through the rest of the academic year.In Washington state, where the nation’s first COVID-19 case was confirmed in January, Gov. Jay Inslee said Friday that he is extending the state’s coronavirus stay-at-home order through at least May 31 and that he will ease the restrictions in four stages. Washington also had the first deadly cluster of cases in the U.S., at a Seattle-area nursing home.Elsewhere around the world, Beijing’s Forbidden City, the imperial palace turned museum that is one of China’s biggest tourist attractions, started welcoming visitors again, and Bangladesh began reopening factories.Across Europe and Asia, millions of workers marked May Day, or international labor day, struggling without jobs or worried they don’t have enough workplace protections against the virus.In the U.S., Shani and Sergei Oveson were excited to resume dine-in seating at their small Salt Lake City restaurant, which has seen an 85% drop in sales since mid-March. Their place, the Ramen Bar, had only half the normal seating capacity because of social-distancing requirements.“We’re really excited to be open, but at the same time we’re scared that the virus will reignite and we’ll have to close again, which would be so hard for us,” Shani Oveson said. “Owning your own business can be so scary financially, we have to risk getting sick to survive.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/like-i-just-got-out-of-jail-over-a-dozen-us-states-ease-covid-19-lockdowns/story-4xvk0CchKa4kPJg1VjrVRL.html
02-05-2020||World||China ‘mishandled situation’ after coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan: White House||The White House on Friday said China “mishandled the situation” after the coronavirus outbreak in its Wuhan city, but refrained from giving a definitive answer on retaliatory measures against the Asian giant.The deadly coronavirus that was first reported in China’s Wuhan city in mid-November has so far killed more than 2,35,000 people globally, including 64,000 Americans, and has infected 3.3 million across the world.Led by the United States, several countries, including Germany, Britain and Australian, are blaming China for the spread of coronavirus across the globe.On Thursday, President Donald Trump had hinted at using tariff as a tool to punish China for mishandling the virus outbreak and the next day the markets went down.“The markets are down substantially today after the President yesterday suggested in the East Room that he might use tariffs to punish China over the coronavirus. Is there any serious consideration being given to putting new tariffs on China or was the President just spitballing yesterday?” the new White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany was asked during her maiden press conference. “I won’t get ahead of any announcements from the President, but I will echo the President’s displeasure with China. It’s no secret that China mishandled this situation,” McEnany told reporters.“Just a few examples for you; they did not share the genetic sequence until a professor in Shanghai did so on his own. The very next day China shut down his lab for quote rectification. They slow-walked information on human to human transmission alongside the World Health Organization and didn’t let US investigators in at a very important time,” she said.“So, we take displeasure with China’s actions, but I certainly won’t get out of the president with those announcements. Again, when it comes to retaliatory measures, I will not get ahead of the president on that,” McEnany asserted.The White House Press Secretary said the US continues to have very limited and dubious data from China and the current assessments indicated that Trump’s statement, that coronavirus came from a lab in Wuhan, is consistent with what some analysts believe is the epicenter of where the virus began.On Thursday, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) had said in a statement that the Intelligence Community concurs with the wide scientific consensus that “the COVID-19 virus was not manmade or genetically modified”. Responding to a question on the ODNI’s statement, McEnany said “Let me remind everyone intelligence is just an estimate essentially, and it’s up to policymakers to decide what to do with that intelligence. In this case, the policymaker is the President of the United States and he will make a decision at the right time.” She alleged that there’s no secret that China stopped US investigators from coming in.“It was of paramount importance that we got into China in an expedited fashion, and that didn’t happen. With respect to the World Health Organization, they have some questions of their own to answer,” the press secretary said.She said the United States, as the president has emphasized, provides about USD 400 million to USD 500 million per year to the WHO compared to China at roughly USD 40 million a year, but yet “WHO appears to have a very clear China bias”.“I mean, look at this timeline and it’s really damning for the WHO when you just consider the fact that on December 31, you had Taiwanese officials warning about human to human transmission and the WHO did not make that public. On January 9 the WHO repeated China’s claim that the virus ‘does not transmit readily between people’. That was quite apparently false,” McEnany said.“On January 14, the WHO again repeated China’s talking points about no human to human transmission. They praised China’s leadership on 22 January. On the 23rd, they said, and this is incredible, the pandemic didn’t represent a public health emergency of international concern,” she said.“And even on February 29, you had the WHO saying that when the coronavirus was spreading around the world, they chose to put, excuse me, political correctness first by opposing lifesaving travel restrictions.” “The travel restrictions this president put in place, the travel restrictions that Dr. Fauci praised as saving lives and you have the World Health Organization opposing a measure that saved American lives. That’s unacceptable, especially at a time when the US was providing USD 400 to 500 million,” the White House Press Secretary said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-mishandled-situation-after-coronavirus-outbreak-in-wuhan-white-house/story-EB0mbPe2wTCACfbyuYLtLM.html
02-05-2020||World||NASA, SpaceX to launch astronauts into space on May 27 despite Covid-19 pandemic||NASA and SpaceX said Friday they were pressing ahead with plans to launch astronauts to space from US soil for the first time in a decade later this month, despite the COVID-19 pandemic.Robert Behnken and Douglas Hurley, both veterans of the Space Shuttle program that was shuttered in 2011, will blast off from the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida on May 27.NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine told reporters that the SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule will be only the fifth class of US spacecraft to take human beings into orbit, after the storied Mercury, Gemini, Apollo and Space Shuttle programs.“If you look globally, this will be the ninth time in history when we put humans on a brand new spacecraft,” said Bridenstine.“We’re going to do it here in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. I’m going to tell you this is a high priority mission for the United States of America,” he added.But, he said, NASA was asking that people avoid traveling to the space center to witness the spectacle.“That makes me sad to even say it -- boy, I wish we could make this into something really spectacular,” he said.Behnken and Hurley, who have been training for the “Demo-2” mission for years, will dock with the International Space Station (ISS) and then remain there for between one to four months, depending on when the next mission takes place, said NASA’s Steve Stich.Crew Dragon is able to remain in orbit for around four months (119 days). Win for SpaceX The mission is a major milestone for SpaceX, the company founded by billionaire Elon Musk, who also leads and founded Tesla.His firm, which was founded in 2002, has now overtaken aerospace behemoth Boeing, which failed in the uncrewed demonstration mission of its Starliner spacecraft last year and will have to start over.SpaceX, which has received billions of dollars from NASA since the late 2000s, has been supplying cargo to the ISS since 2012, and has established itself as the leader in the private space sector thanks to its reusable rocket, the Falcon 9.“I’ll feel a little relief when they’re in orbit, I’ll feel more relief when they get to the station and then obviously, I will start sleeping again when they’re back safely on the planet Earth,” Gwynne Shotwell, the company’s chief operating officer said.The pandemic has, naturally, impacted the program, but Shotwell said that all precautions were being taken to protect the astronauts.“We are ensuring that only essential personnel are near them. They’re wearing masks and gloves. We’re cleaning the training facility twice daily. “I think we’re really doing a great job to ensure that we are not impacting the safety or the health of the astronauts’ lives.”Takeoff is scheduled for 4:42pm on May 27 (2042 GMT), with space station docking scheduled about 19 hours later, on May 28.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasa-spacex-to-launch-astronauts-into-space-on-may-27-despite-covid-19-pandemic/story-otLBSLJY5Z3T6W4oHkr5DI.html
02-05-2020||World||Indians at greater risk from Covid-19 in UK’s health sector: Report||Indians make up one in 10 of all foreign-born doctors in the UK’s National Health Service (NHS) and therefore face a greater risk from the coronavirus pandemic, according to a new report published on Friday.The Institute of Fiscal Studies (IFS) study, in its report analysing the ethnic variables in the impact of coronavirus, also found that Indians are among the ethnic groups less likely to be impacted by the economic consequences of the lockdown imposed to curb the spread of the deadly virus due to their employment in more secure sectors.“Indian men are particularly exposed to the virus due to their prevalence in healthcare roles,” said the report titled ‘Are some ethnic groups more vulnerable to Covid-19 than others?’ “Indian men are 150 per cent more likely to work in health or social care roles than their white British counterparts. While the Indian ethnic group makes up 3 per cent of the working-age population of England and Wales, they account for 14 per cent of doctors,” it said.The IFS analysis found that among the UK’s working age population, those working in health and social care may be at the greatest risk of infection, with Indians facing a high risk due to their sheer numbers.While 37 per cent of the UK’s doctors are foreign-born, nearly one in 10 are from India – all currently on the frontline of the coronavirus fightback in hospitals and other care settings.In reference to its analysis of the economic impact of the pandemic on different ethnic groups, the study found that Pakistani and Bangladeshi households were more vulnerable among the South Asian cohort due to a higher proportion of them in sectors which are undergoing shutdown due to the social distancing rules.“Ethnic groups also vary substantially in their economic vulnerability under the restrictions currently in place… Indian ethnic groups face lower economic risks and are more comparable to white British in this regard,” according to the study.“Bangladeshi and Pakistani groups, by contrast, appear to be particularly at risk due to the high percentage of either group working in shutdown sectors and/or in self-employment, combined with the prevalence of single-earner households which reduces the potential for income buffers within the household,” it added.In its other findings, the IFS study concluded that coronavirus patients from black African backgrounds in England and Wales are dying at more than triple the rate of white Britons, followed by Pakistani men as the next highest category.Black and South Asian ethnic groups have been found to have much higher rates of diabetes than the population as a whole, and older Pakistani men have been found to have particularly high levels of cardiovascular disease – all considered higher risk factors.Besides, compared to white British households, minority ethnic groups also tend to be more likely to live in overcrowded accommodation, making social distancing more difficult.The study concludes: “In sum, there is clear evidence for disproportionality in COVID-19 mortalities thus far for a number of ethnic groups after accounting for their age profiles and places of residence.“While it is difficult to say definitively with the data that are currently available, the clustering of some minority groups in key worker occupations – and in health and care key worker roles in particular – alongside greater susceptibility to relevant long-term conditions, are likely to be contributing factors to the observed inequalities.” The analysis focuses on a limited set of risk factors in terms of both infection risk and economic vulnerability in the short term and concludes that more research is required for a better understanding of the disparity in the impact of the pandemic among different ethnicities.The UK government launched an official review, led by Public Health England, earlier this month as it emerged that black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) are affected disproportionately by the deadly virus.

02-05-2020||World||NATO withholds key information on Taliban attacks: US Watchdog||NATO’s US-led mission in Afghanistan is withholding key information about Taliban attacks, a US government watchdog said Friday, potentially making insights into the war harder just as the Pentagon slashes its troop presence.The Resolute Support (RS) mission previously disclosed data on “enemy-initiated attacks”, one of the few remaining public metrics of the conflict and the strength of the Taliban and other insurgent groups.In its quarterly report released Friday, the office of the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) said RS had stopped providing numbers.Instead, RS gave only a short statement noting the Taliban had stepped up attacks in March, immediately after the signing of a US-Taliban deal that was supposed to pave the way to peace talks. “Between March 1 and 31, the Taliban refrained from attacks against coalition forces; however they increased attacks against (Afghan forces) to levels above seasonal norms,” RS said, according to the report.Under the deal, US and other foreign forces will quit Afghanistan next year if the Taliban start peace talks with Kabul and stick to various security commitments.In the week ahead of the February 29 deal signing in Doha, violence plummeted during a partial truce and US officials hoped attacks would stay low.Instead, the Taliban immediately resumed assaults on Afghan forces.During the deal negotiations, the Taliban had agreed to stop hitting foreign troops, but there was no such prohibition on targeting Afghan forces.- ‘Unacceptably high’ violence -RS told SIGAR that it chose to restrict data because enemy attacks were now a “critical part” of discussions “regarding ongoing political negotiations between the US and the Taliban”.SIGAR noted the Pentagon said it might release the information in the future.A Pentagon spokesman justified the decision to withhold data, citing ongoing talks.“So the decision was that we’re working toward a better solution and a better place for Afghanistan and that the sharing of that information would not... move the ball forward,” the spokesman, Jonathan Hoffman, told reporters.“The level of violence by the Taliban is unacceptably high,” he said, adding that it was not conducive to a diplomatic solution. The move to withhold attack numbers follows a trend of diminishing insights into America’s longest war, which the US has given up ever winning and is instead trying to end through a political agreement that will provide face-saving cover to leave Afghanistan.In 2018, RS stopped providing data on how much of the country the Taliban held or contested, amid criticism the war was at a stalemate. That followed a decision by the Afghan government to classify data on how many of its soldiers and police were getting killed by the Taliban, after shocking figures showed several thousand were dying each year.Data on enemy attacks “was one of the last remaining metrics SIGAR was able to use to report publicly on the security situation in Afghanistan,” the watchdog said.The Pentagon is on course to cut its troop numbers from about 12,000 to 8,600 in the coming months.In its report, SIGAR also warned that Afghanistan faces a brutal toll in its worsening coronavirus crisis.“Afghanistan’s numerous and, in some cases, unique vulnerabilities... make it likely the country will confront a health disaster in the coming months,” SIGAR said.Afghanistan officials have so far confirmed 2,171 cases of COVID-19, including 64 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nato-withholds-key-information-on-taliban-attacks-us-watchdog/story-ghiS7GW2VNjOyB0kqrdeYK.html
02-05-2020||World||North Korea’s Kim Jong Un makes first appearance in nearly three weeks: Report||North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has made his first public appearance since speculation about his health began last month, cutting the ribbon at the opening of a fertilizer factory, KCNA reported Saturday.Kim attended the event on Friday in Sunchon, near the capital Pyongyang, after nearly three weeks of swirling rumours that the leader of the nuclear-armed nation was seriously ill or possibly dead. The North Korean leader had not made a public appearance since presiding over a Workers’ Party politburo meeting on April 11, and the following day state media reported that he had inspected fighter jets.At Friday’s event, “all the participants broke into thunderous cheers of ‘hurrah!’“ when Kim appeared, the Korean Central news agency reported.He inspected the facility and was “briefed about the production processes,” the report said.Kim “said with deep emotion” that his grandfather Kim Il Sung and father Kim Jong Il “would be greatly pleased if they heard the news that the modern phosphatic fertilizer factory has been built,” it added.Also in attendance were other senior officials, including his sister and close adviser, Kim Yo Jong. Photos from the ceremony were not immediately released.Conjecture over Kim’s health had grown since his conspicuous no-show at April 15 celebrations for the birthday of his grandfather, the North’s founder -- the most important day in the country’s political calendar.His absence unleashed a series of unconfirmed reports over his condition, triggering global fears over the North’s nuclear arsenal -- and who would succeed Kim were he unable to lead.A top security advisor to South Korea’s President Moon Jae-in said less than a week ago that Kim was “alive and well,” downplaying rumors that he was ill or incapacitated.The advisor, Moon Chung-in, told CNN that Kim had been staying in Wonsan -- a resort town in the east of North Korea -- since April 13, adding: “No suspicious movements have so far been detected.”- Rumours of ill health -Daily NK, an online media outlet run mostly by North Korean defectors, reported that Kim was undergoing treatment after a cardiovascular procedure last month.Citing an unidentified source inside the country, it said Kim -- who is in his mid-30s -- had needed urgent treatment due to heavy smoking, obesity and fatigue.Soon afterwards, CNN reported that Washington was “monitoring intelligence” that Kim was in “grave danger” after undergoing surgery, quoting an anonymous US official.US President Donald Trump appeared to confirm that Kim was alive earlier this week.On Friday, Trump refused to comment on Kim’s reported re-emergence.Previous absences from the public eye on Kim’s part have prompted speculation about his health.The North is extremely secretive, and doubly so about its leadership. Kim’s father and predecessor had been dead for two days before anyone outside the innermost circles of North Korean leadership was any the wiser.In 2014, Kim Jong Un dropped out of sight for nearly six weeks before reappearing with a cane. Days later, the South’s spy agency said he had undergone surgery to remove a cyst from his ankle.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-s-kim-jong-un-makes-first-appearance-in-nearly-three-weeks-report/story-Qf3FcYI5et0pbTpBfYPIGP.html
02-05-2020||World||US issues emergency approval for remdesivir for Covid-19 patients||U.S. regulators on Friday allowed emergency use of the first drug that appears to help some COVID-19 patients recover faster, a milestone in the global search for effective therapies against the coronavirus.The Food and Drug Administration said in a statement that Gilead Science’s intravenous drug would be specifically indicated for hospitalized patients with “severe disease,” such as those experiencing breathing problems requiring supplemental oxygen or ventilators.President Donald Trump announced the news at the White House alongside Gilead CEO Daniel O’Day and Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephen Hahn.“This was lightning speed in terms of getting something approved” said Hahn, calling the drug “an important clinical advance.”The FDA acted after preliminary results from a government-sponsored study showed that the drug, remdesivir, shortened the time to recovery by 31%, or about four days on average, for hospitalized COVID-19 patients.The study of 1,063 patients is the largest and most strict test of the drug and included a comparison group that received just usual care so remdesivir’s effects could be rigorously evaluated.Those given the drug were able to leave the hospital in 11 days on average vs. 15 days for the comparison group. The drug may also help avert deaths, but the effect is not yet large enough for scientists to know for sure.Dr. Sameer Khanijo, a critical care specialist, said he wants to see additional studies to clarify the drug’s benefit.“I don’t think this is a cure yet, but I think it’s starting to point us in the right direction,” said Khanijo of North Shore University Hospital in New York. “As a society it’s nice to have something that will help stem the tide of this disease.”The FDA said preliminary results for federal researchers warranted Friday’s decision, though regulators acknowledged “there is limited information known about the safety and effectiveness of using remdesivir.”The drug’s side effects include potential inflammation of the liver and problems related to its infusion, which could lead to nausea, vomiting, sweating and low blood pressure. Information about dosing and potential safety issues will be provided to physicians and patients, the FDA said.The National Institutes of Health’s Dr. Anthony Fauci said Wednesday the drug would become a new standard of care for severely ill COVID-19 patients. The drug, which blocks an enzyme the virus uses to copy its genetic material, has not been tested on people with milder illness.The FDA authorized the drug under its emergency powers to quickly speed experimental drugs, tests and other medical products to patients during public health crises.In normal times the FDA requires “substantial evidence” of a drug’s safety and effectiveness, usually through one or more large, rigorously controlled patient studies. But during public health emergencies the agency can waive those standards and require only that an experimental drug’s potential benefits outweigh its risks.Gilead has said it would donate its currently available stock of the drug and is ramping up production to make more. It said the U.S. government would coordinate distribution of remdesivir to places most in need of it.No drugs are approved now for treating the coronavirus, and remdesivir will still need formal approval.The FDA can convert the drug’s status to full approval if Gilead or other researchers provide additional data of remdesivir’s safety and effectiveness.“This is a very, very early stage so you wouldn’t expect to have any sort of full approval at this point,” said Cathy Burgess, an attorney specializing in FDA issues. “But obviously they want to get this out to patients as quickly as possible.”The FDA previously allowed narrow use of a malaria drug, hydroxychloroquine, for hospitalized patients who were unable to take part in ongoing studies of the medication. Trump repeatedly promoted it as a possible COVID-19 treatment, but no large high-quality studies have shown the drug works for that and it has significant safety concerns.The FDA warned doctors late last month against prescribing the drug outside of hospital or research settings, due to risks of sometimes fatal heart side effects.Two small studies published Friday add to concerns about the malaria drug. Critically ill COVID-19 patients given hydroxychloroquine were prone to heart rhythm problems, and for many risks mounted when it was combined with an antibiotic, the studies found.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-issues-emergency-approval-for-remdesivir-for-covid-19-patients/story-YJaDzIrS7yVR1xHTEZU6yJ.html
02-05-2020||World||Virus in France has local traces: Report||The coronavirus outbreak in France was not caused by cases imported from China, but from a locally circulating strain of unknown origin, according to a new study reported by local media.The study, published by virologists at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, said the French strain may have been circulating locally and unrecognised before the global outbreak accelerated, French public radio network RFI said in a report on its website.“Tests on samples from 97 French and three Algerians infected with Sars-CoV-2 suggest that the virus may have been around in France before the pandemic started,” it said.Genetic analysis of the samples revealed that the dominant types of viral strains in France belonged to a group with a common ancestor that did not come from either China or Italy, it said, citing the 16-page study that was first reported by South China Morning Post newspaper.“The French outbreak has been mainly seeded by one or several variants of this clade (group) … we can infer that the virus was silently circulating in France in February,” the SCMP quoted researchers led by Dr Sylvie van der Werf and Etienne Simon-Loriere as saying. The research was published in a non-peer reviewed paper released on bioRxiv.org.The earliest sample in the French clade was collected on 19 February from a patient who had no travel history and no known contact with returned travellers.However, “current sampling clearly prevents reliable inference for the timing of introduction in France,” making it impossible to conclude that the virus existed in France even before it was discovered in China, the researchers said. France detected the virus in late January, before any other country in Europe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/virus-in-france-has-local-traces-report/story-YZ0Un87JH3RRWqyySXbNrM.html

The UAE assistance to India comes in recognition of the profound and brotherly ties our two countries have shared throughout the years.The UAE has provided more than 348 tonnes of aid to nearly 35 countries, supporting nearly 348,000 professionals. The Indian consulate in Dubai thanked the UAE for the aid in a tweet and said: “We are also happy that we have been able to send medicines to UAE to fight Covid-19 and more medical personnel should come to UAE soon.”India has earlier deployed a medical rapid response team to Kuwait for two weeks to provide technical expertise and train that country’s medical personnel.The UAE is home to more than 3 million Indian expatriates, and tens of thousands of them work in the healthcare sector.

This is a significantly high number. We are in a position to ramp up testing up to 1.25 lakh a day”, he said responding to queries from media persons in an online interaction organized by the Kerala Health Department.He lauded Kerala’s containment strategy for Covid-19 and said it was a role model for many other states.On Saturday, the total number of Covid-19 cases in Kerala stood at 499 out of which 96 are active cases. A total of 403 people have recovered and have been discharged.When asked about the alleged delay on the part of regulatory bodies in giving sanctions to some of the indigenously developed testing kits especially the one by Sree Chithira Institute for Science and Technology he said there was no delay on the part of the ICMR. Earlier Congress leader and Thiruvananthapuram MP Shashi Tharoor had questioned the delay in approving indigenously developed testing kits.Referring to the general demand for antibody tests, Dr B Ekbal, who heads an expert panel that advises the Kerala government on prevention of the coronavirus, said antibody test was not for individual diagnosis but was employed to probe whether the disease reached the stage of community transmission.Across the globe, antibody test is the tool that decides community spread of the disease. “For that to be held in Kerala, we need to devise statistical modeling. Also, one has to validate the antibody test by testing the blood sample of the patient who has recovered,” Dr Ekbal said, in reply to another question.He said the ICMR is yet to endorse the Chinese equipment for antibody tests and a validation exercise is currently on for three indigenously-developed kits for the purpose. They are ones produced by Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute of Medical Sciences and Technology, Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology and by HLL Lifecare bought by the State Medical Services Corporation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-can-conduct-1-25-lakh-covid-19-tests-a-day-says-icmr-official/story-SB9N42d9Ffh3dTKQTcPa1K.html

Discrimination is against our moral fabric and the Rule of law. Indian nationals in the UAE should always remember this,” Kapoor had tweeted, quoting another tweet from Prime Minister Narendra Modi that said Covid-19 doesn’t “see race, religion, colour, caste, creed, language or borders before striking”.A spokesperson for Azadea Group, which operates a chain of Italian restaurants in Dubai, said chef Rawat Rohit had been suspended and is facing a disciplinary probe, according to Gulf News.Sharjah-based Pneumics Automation suspended its storekeeper Sachin Kinnigoli and withheld his salary. “The matter is under investigation. We have a zero tolerance policy. Anyone found guilty of insulting or showing contempt for someone’s religion will have to bear the consequences,” the firm’s owner said.Dubai-based Transguard Group said it sacked an employee who posted anti-Islamic messages on his Facebook page using the name Vishal Thakur. The employee was handed over to authorities and is in the custody of Dubai Police, a Transguard spokesperson said.The issue of inflammatory posts by Indian expatriates has been in the limelight since it was raised on several occasions by Princess Hend al-Qassimi, a member of the UAE’s royal family.Former Indian ambassador Navdeep Suri has also cautioned Indians about the UAE’s hate speech laws and similar warnings have been issued by Indian missions in other Gulf Cooperation Council states.UAE’s anti-discrimination and anti-hate law prohibits all acts “that stoke religious hatred and/or which insult religion through any form of expression, be it speech or the written word, books, pamphlets or via online media”.Last month, Sharjah-based businessman Sohan Roy had to apologise for a video depicting Islamic clerics leading blindfolded men in skull caps in an adaptation of his poem on religious bigotry, while three other Indians were fired for derogatory social media posts. A police complaint was filed against Sameer Bhandari, CEO of Future Vision Events & Weddings, after he told an Indian job-seeker to “Go back to Pakistan” in a text message.In March, chef Trilok Singh was fired from a restaurant in Dubai for an online threat against a student in Delhi over her views on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-more-indians-in-uae-face-action-for-islamophobic-social-media-posts/story-CfMXIzBOeD7zFqYjWoC6JN.html

Maharaj said he sent the request to Pokhriyal on Saturday morning and hopes that his request is accepted.“I decided to write to the Union minister, as in my opinion, adding lessons on the fight against the pandemic in the curriculum will help the children understand what sort of measures were taken to contain the spread of the deadly virus in a country of a billion-plus people,” said Maharaj. He added that the lessons for the children in the junior classes may be interactive in nature, teaching them the benefits of social distancing, face masks and sanitisers. “This is necessary, because such precautionary measures will become a part of our regular life in the future due to this pandemic,” Maharaj said.He added that the students of higher classes could be given a case study on the containment efforts.For Coronavirus Live Updates“Debates could also be organised on the issue so that students can understand the pandemic in a much better way, and learn how a country of India’s size fought it while setting an example for the world,” Maharaj said.Maharaj feels this initiative, if approved, will educate the coming generations about the pandemic and prepare them for any such threat in the future.“If the fight against this pandemic is added to the school curriculum, then, I think India would be the first country to do so in the world,” he added.

When diseases like Spanish Flu, SARS ended so will this Corona pandemic. The only thing we have to do is to hold on and be cautious,” said Khan, who happens to yesteryear’s Bollywood actor and film maker Sanjay Khan’s daughter.Khan and her family members had been recently tested negative for coronavirus after one of her in-house staff members had tested positive for Covid-19. However, she was in quarantine till April 29. “In life I don’t fear anything because I believe that whatever has started will end too. My brother (Zayed Khan) keeps telling me ‘zyada brave mat bano…’ but I cannot change myself. I am like this. It was a relief to be tested negative but more than me it was for my kids I was worried about. When my staff member fell sick I had to check on him so in a way neither I was too far from him nor too close so test was a must. But I can’t leave my staff to fend themselves in times of trouble as they are like an extended family,” she said over the phone.She is now keeping herself busy with fasting and praying in the holy month of Ramazan. “I have blood pressure issues and the last time when I kept a fast I felt as if my soul was about to leave my body. But now after 15 years I have resumed fasting. And it’s more because I wanted to really feel the hunger. Imagine the plight of daily wage migrants who are walking hundreds of miles on foot and that too empty stomach. I hope and pray that government measures do reach them as soon as possible,” Khan said.Khan has been very vocal on social media and has been in the eye of storm. “I cannot sit back and take wrong statements made by anyone without thorough investigation and proof. How can we sitting in our drawing rooms blame any person, group or community for any issue without being sure about it. Social media is there to connect people easily and not to be judgmental and hurt others. And trust me I will be so always,” she said.Waiting for lockdown to end, Khan is utilising this time to create new designs. “I and my team are busy designing some brilliant stuff for the upcoming season. Also I am caught up completing a lot of legalities related to business.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/staying-positive-can-help-us-pass-through-troubled-times/story-RHxMWMkFHH2uaYj2G9gqrI.html
02-05-2020||India||Making Aarogya Setu app mandatory can lead to legal challenges: Experts||The Government’s move to make Aarogya Setu application mandatory for everyone, particularly for private companies and individuals, may have legal complications and misuse of its data for monitoring activities other than Covid-19 cannot be ruled out, according to experts.Pavan Duggal, one of the top cyber law experts in the country, told HT that – “First of all, the intention of the government to do contract tracing through Aarogya Setu app is indeed noble. However, there is no law passed by the Parliament authorizing the creation and making mandatory of this app which is in contravention of the Information Technology Act, 2000 and Act and rules and regulations. So, while it could be used as an emergency measure (in this case for tracing Covid-19 patients), it could open up a Pandora ’s Box of legal challenges for the government.”Duggal pointed out that when this application was launched, it had uploaded both terms and conditions and privacy policy, but now terms and conditions that stated that ‘government won’t be responsible for any unauthorized leakage of data’ have been removed, at least from Apple store.ALSO READ | ‘To track citizens’: Rahul Gandhi on compulsory use of Aarogya Setu app“The privacy policy also doesn’t give any clarity on how secure your data is. There is no mention of any cyber security parameters and it doesn’t explain how it complies with the IT Act 2000 and IT Rules 2011. The app still doesn’t tell us who all might be able to access my data in terms of governmental agencies. So, the chances of this data being used for monitoring people cannot be ruled out,” he added.Tarun Wig, co-founder of Innefu - data analytics and cyber security company, said “Aarogya Setu app can definitely be made a little less intrusive but I personally feel that in such times, privacy can somewhat take a back seat.”Around 45 organisations and more than 100 individuals on Saturday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, home minister Amit Shah and IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad against the mandatory use of the Aarogya Setu app for workers in both private and public workplaces, as mentioned in the ministry of home affairs order. “While the government initially claimed that the use of Aarogya Setu would be purely voluntary, downloading the app was soon made mandatory for all Central Armed Police Forces personnel and employees of Prasar Bharati,” the letter signed by the groups stated. The move could also violate privacy laws as well as the Puttaswamy privacy judgement, the letter says. The government representative, however, denied that there were privacy issues.Abhishek Singh of MyGov termed the concerns as non-issues and said that the app is mandatory only till the pandemic exists. “Till the epidemic law is in force, only those who are travelling to offices will have to download the app. Once the epidemic is over, a user can delete the app,” Singh said. He said that due to demand from all quarters to open business, which brings in the possibility of contamination, offices were asked to ensure that the app is downloaded. “Commercial organisations have not raised the issue, neither have industry bodies like FICCI, ASSOCHAM or NASSCOM,” said Singh.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi too called the app intrusive. He tweeted – “The Aarogya Setu app is a sophisticated surveillance system, outsourced to a private operator, with no institutional oversight -- raising serious data security and privacy concerns. Technology can help keep us safe; but fear must not be leveraged to track citizens without their consent.” In a directive issued on Friday as part of the third phase of lockdown, which begins from Monday with graded easing of curbs, the ministry of home affairs (MHA) stated that “use of Aarogya app shall be made mandatory for all employees, both public and private” and that “head of the respective organizations to ensure 100% coverage of this app among the employees”. For containment zones, which are high risk areas sealed in a particular district, the local authorities have been asked to ensure 100% coverage of the app among all residents.The government order states that anybody violating the latest guidelines could face action invoking the Disaster Management Act and Indian Penal Code. Eight crore people, including almost all government officials had downloaded the government app till Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/making-aarogya-setu-app-mandatory-can-lead-to-legal-challenges-experts/story-gJz7fcUxamEwtAbtiI0fnI.html

Das, a widow, also donated Rs 2,000 to the local press club that is providing cooked food to the poor and destitute people in the locality.The BDO (Block Development Office) said Das has set an example for other people of the state by her selfless act. “She said she was moved by the plight of several other people going hungry during the lockdown. After she came to know about the state government’s appeal to people to donate money to fight the pandemic, she decided to donate the money,” he said. The woman lost her husband a decade ago.Incidentally, in October last year Das had donated Rs 50,001 from her old age pension and savings to the Jagannath Temple corpus at Puri. The BDO said that she had a patch of land which she had sold off 5-6 years ago and kept the money. “As she has no children, she did not use the money. She probably donated the money to the Jagannath temple from that amount,” he said.When asked what the state government would do for Das, the BDO said the government would think about it.Das has no children and ekes out her living by begging in the locality and sleeps in a room of the Jagulaipada grampanchayat office. Incidentally, after the grampanchayat office was turned into a quarantine centre, the woman was forced to look for shelter in other places.Subhransu Sutar, a member of the local press club, said Das always remains happy even during adversity. “Even when she has to beg for food, she thinks of others going hungry,” said Sutar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/75-yr-old-woman-beggar-in-odisha-donates-rs-5-000-for-fighting-against-covid-19-pandemic/story-sZH0hUnpOwNnTR4NBddQLK.html
02-05-2020||India||‘To track citizens’: Rahul Gandhi on compulsory use of Aarogya Setu app||Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Saturday said the compulsory use of the Aarogya Setu app, with no institutional checks, is bound to raise data and privacy concerns for the citizens. He added it is akin to spying on citizens.“The Arogya Setu app, is a sophisticated surveillance system, outsourced to a pvt operator, with no institutional oversight - raising serious data security & privacy concerns. Technology can help keep us safe; but fear must not be leveraged to track citizens without their consent,” tweeted Gandhi this evening.Soon after the Congress leader’s tweet, IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, dismissing the snooping charge, underlined how the app helps protect people in their fight against the coronavirus.“Daily a new lie. Aarogya Setu is a powerful companion which protects people. It has a robust data security architecture. Those who indulged in surveillance all their lives, won’t know how tech can be leveraged for good!,” tweeted the minister.The government, on Friday, made the Aarogya Setu App mandatory for people living in the coronavirus Containment Zones inside the 130 districts identified as the Red Zones. The government considers the App to be a handy coronavirus containment tool which can be used to assess the level of risk an individual is exposed to vis-a-vis Covid-19 infection. The App, developed by the ministry of electronics and information technology (MEITY), uses cell phone tracking technology to put individuals in low-risk, moderate and high-risk categories by tracing if the person came in contact with a virus-infected patient or a person suspected to be infected.Around 45 organisations and more than 100 individuals on Saturday wrote to the Prime Minister Narendra Modi, home minister Amit Shah and IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad against the mandatory use of the Aarogya Setu app for workers in both private and public workplaces.“While the government initially claimed that the use of Aarogya Setu would be purely voluntary, downloading the app was soon made mandatory for all Central Armed Police Forces personnel and employees of Prasar Bharati,” the letter signed by the groups stated.

The house was adjourned sine die on March 16 due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak, much ahead of its scheduled adjournment on April 4. “As the house is not in session, it can’t elect its leader as of now,” said a Patna high court lawyer, YB Giri.The complications deepened when the Election Commission of India (ECI) deferred the biennial elections to the house for 17 seats, which were due to be filled by May 7, owing to the pandemic and subsequent lockdown.Noted constitutional expert Subhash Kashyap said that there would be no chairman of the council, as there is no established convention to guide the state legislature to tide over such an impasse.“The post has remained vacant in the past twice. Unlike the case of the chief minister or a minister, who can continue in their position for a period of six months without being a member of either house, one has to be a member of the house before being elected as the chairman or the speaker,” said Kashyap.Rashid, who is heading the council as the acting chairman for the past two years after his predecessor Awadhesh Narayan Singh’s term expired, said he would demit the office once his term expired. “It is now up to the ECI to set the election process in motion,” he said.A senior officer of the council claimed that there was still a chance to retain Rashid as the working chairman by nominating him to any of the two seats vacated by Rajiv Ranjan alias Lalan Singh and Pasupati Kumar Paswan, both of whom got elected to the Lok Sabha. “The term of the two seats will expire on May 27. Before the expiry of the term, Rashid may be reelected or nominated again,” the official quoted above said.Officials said there would not be any significant impact on the functioning of the legislative council in the absence of a chairman or a deputy chairman.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesIn case of an emergency, the governor may nominate any member as the working chairman for the purpose of convening the house following which the house could elect a chairman with due process.The post of the chairman of the legislative council has remained unoccupied for a total of 30 days in the past since it was established 83 years ago—between May 7- June3 in 1980 and January 13 to January 17 in 1987.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-lockdown-fallout-bihar-legislative-council-to-become-headless-on-may-7/story-wxcBN2QQbuGeIx8UQ1gTQO.html

Only the shrill sirens of ambulances passing through empty streets break the gloomy silence at times. There is a hush in burial grounds and cremation centres alike. More so if the bereaved are walking around in puffed PPE (personal protection equipment) kits.“Mera hi bachcha hai (It is my child),” mumbles a frail Abdul, standing beside the mortuary official and ambulance driver, both in PPE suits, near the body of his 20-day-old son. The infant is perhaps the youngest Covid-19 victim in the world.“Suhaan,” says Abdul speaking just one word which is the name of his child lying wrapped in protective medical covers no bigger than a small white bundle. The prayers are read with the body still in the ambulance and driven into the cemetery as a precaution against the coronavirus infection. The bereaved father only slides the hood and shield covering his face to have one last glimpse at the bundle enclosing his child. His face is flushed with sweat caused by the suffocating PPE suit or it could be his tears. With the rigorous cremation protocol for Covid-19 victims, it is hard for the bereaved to choose between grief and fear.“We know of a 45-day-old Covid-19 positive case from Jamnagar and one from the US, but this child was just 20 days old,” informs Dr. Ashok Gupta, Superintendent of JK Lone children’s hospital where Suhaan was being treated for sepsis, according to his symptoms. Ruling out an infection from the mother (intrauterine infection), since no one in Abdul’s family is Covid-19 positive yet, Dr. Gupta suggested the baby may have been exposed to someone who was perhaps asymptomatic. Since the family came from Chandpole, an area under curfew due to a high number of Covid-19 positive cases, he decided to test the newborn for the virus too. But the child passed away within a day of being brought to the hospital, before the report emerged positive. “Please write all this...perhaps it can save someone’s newborn from coronavirus,” pleads Abdul as he drinks water beneath a tap at the cemetery, somehow managing to keep his hands clad in gloves and cautiously away from his face.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/20-day-old-jaipur-infant-may-be-world-s-youngest-covid-19-victim/story-K0KZZJ3WuleFLf7rhTChBN.html

Ration dealer Halim Sheikh’s house was ransacked in the incident.The villagers alleged that they were getting much less rice than what the government had promised. Later, senior officers from the district administration also went there to restore order. They assured the villagers that action would be taken against Sheikh.Rahim Sheikh, a villager, said, “Taken together, all members of my family are entitled to get 17.5 kg flour and 35 kg rice a month but the dealer gave us only 3 kg rice and 7 kg flour. He is hoarding rations meant for poor people.”The villagers also alleged that Sheikh was giving them poor quality ration. Two days ago they staged an agitation.The agitation started again on Saturday outside Sheikh’s house. “Till Saturday action has been taken against 263 ration dealers in Bengal and many of them have been suspended. However it is the opposition that is instigating people to reap political benefit during this crisis. The arson at Salar in Murshidabad was planned by the Congress,” said state food and supplies minister Jyotipriyo Mullick.Bharatpur-II community block development officer Paritosh Majumder refused to comment on the incident. Other officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said the process of suspending the ration dealer had started and he has been detained by the police.Congress legislator from Bharatpur (the village is part of the constituency) Kamalesh Chatterjee said, “People in this village were not getting adequate ration for a long time. They kept quiet fearing reprisal from local Trinamool Congress leaders. They flared up on Saturday.”In a similar incident, hundreds of villagers on Saturday staged agitation outside the local ration dealer’s home at Jashoitala village in the Lalgola police station area of Murshidabad. They alleged that Manowara Bibi and her husband Rabiul Hasan, the ration dealer, are giving poor quality food grain to villagers.“The ration dealer is giving very poor quality rice and that too in less quantity. He is also selling kerosene at a higher price,” said Abdus Samad, a villager.Officers from Lalgola police station reached the village and brought the situation under control.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/planned-by-congress-bengal-minister-for-arson-at-ration-dealer-s-home/story-qZVIhqT7sTovbTVeiH46zL.html

It is doing ugly politics on the issue. The lockdown has been extended to save the lives of people. The entire country understands it, except the Congress,” he said.The Congress had asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to address citizens on the way to deal with the coronavirus crisis and economy reeling under it.Asking when will the lockdown be finally lifted, the Congress’ chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said the prime minister must also lay out an exit strategy and spell out the goal in dealing with the issue.Hussain wondered whether the Congress will say anything constructive or will it merely criticise every day what the government is doing.He said the government has already taken a number of welfare measures, including giving ration to the poor and transferring money to the accounts of farmers and poor women among others.Hussain noted that the government has cut down on all its expenses, and even salaries of the president, prime minister and MPs have been reduced by over 30 per cent. The government will spend whatever is necessary to take the country forward, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-involved-in-ugly-politics-amid-covid-19-crisis-bjp/story-2pEvcPNjgQFhO0sMjXoFGO.html

Similarly 62 samples were sent from two districts in Arunachal Pradesh.“All 17 tissue samples from Assam were positive for ASFV genome by real time PCR and nucleotide sequencing analysis. Eleven out of 62 samples from Arunachal Pradesh were positive for ASFV genome,” according to the NIHSAD test results.According to the World Organisation for Animal Health, ASF is a severe viral disease affecting both domestic and wild pigs. It can spread by live or dead pigs and pork. The disease does not transmit from animals to humans.Transmission can also occur via contaminated feed and objects such as shoes, clothes, vehicles, knives and other equipment, says World Organisation for Animal Health. Unlike Classical Swine Fever (CSF), there is no vaccine for ASF.“We were providing vaccine for CSF, but we have stopped giving that vaccine in those districts where ASF has now been detected. There is no vaccine or medicines available for ASF. The disease doesn’t get transmitted to humans,” Assam agriculture Atul Bora said on Saturday.Bora said that there is no possibility of getting infected by ASF due to consumption of pork and pork products. He said that the state government would take measures to ensure that the disease doesn’t spread to other areas.Assam had earlier banned the sale of pigs and pork in the six affected districts where many pigs had died recently.“ASF, which is epizootic (epidemic) has reached northeast India. We need to be extra vigilant and follow bio-security,” said Manoj Kumar Basumatary, president of North East Progressive Pig Farmers Association (NEPPFA).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/african-swine-fever-detected-in-pigs-in-assam-and-arunachal-pradesh/story-IonDAhnHJMuoUCTiGzNUtN.html

The assets belong to the accused involved in the case.It said a supplementary prosecution complaint (charge sheet) has been filed against accused Rajan S Shah of V S Healthcare Mumbai and 11 others early this week before a special PMLA court in Patna, Bihar after some new facts came to light.The ED case, filed under criminal provision of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), is against a Gaya-based businessman, Motilal, promoter of MTI Cotton Mills Pvt Ltd, and others linked to him.He has been chargesheeted by the agency earlier and is in judicial custody at present.The businessman has been accused by the agency of being hand in glove with Bank of India (GB Road branch in Gaya district) for laundering illegal funds post the demonetisation declared by the central government on November 8, 2016.The accused made illegal cash deposits worth Rs 44.79 crore in various bank accounts, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) alleged.“Some of these cash deposits were fraudulently transferred to the bank accounts of different entities without the knowledge or consent of the account holders,” it said.  The state police had filed an FIR against the accused and others in December, 2016, which became the basis for the ED’s PMLA case.The ED alleged that during the demonetisation period, Motilal “illegally deposited the cash in 17 accounts held in his name, in the name of his firm, relatives and friends and five other accounts in the name of complainants Rajesh Kumar, Shashi Kumar, their firms and relatives”.“These cash amounts were handed over to him by Dhiraj Jain, a businessman of Gaya, and Delhi businessman Bimal Jain.” “On the direction of Dhiraj Jain and Pawan Jain, Motilal subsequently transferred the amount on the same day or the next day to the bank accounts of certain Delhi and Kolkata-based firms,” it said.It was found that Motilal had carried out these illegal transactions “with the connivance” of bank officials.  This cash is proceeds of crime under the PMLA and its transfer to other accounts represents the process of integration of the tainted money with the mainstream economy, the ED said.The agency has sought the court’s permission to confiscate assets like bank balance, fixed deposits, a factory and an office premise, which it had attached earlier and is valued at Rs 8.12 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-files-fresh-charge-sheet-linked-to-2016-demonetisation-scheme-in-patna/story-6rETCDmAPO1YI0fCVW4FrJ.html

Since then, the regular collection of offerings witnessed a record dip.From an average collection of Rs 23 lakh a day as offerings (or a total of Rs 85 crore annually, including online offerings) during 2019-20, the figure plunged to between Rs 10,000 and Rs 15,000 a day, according to officials of the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC).As regular collections declined, online offerings surged.“On normal days earlier, online offerings ranged from Rs 5 lakh to Rs 10 lakh a month. In the last month, collections through online modes increased by 20% as per an estimate,” said Mukhtiar Singh, chief manager of the Golden Temple.Another official privy to the shrine’s financial matters said: “The online offerings do not include few major offerings recently made by some devotees. For instance, a devotee from Amritsar offered Rs 5 lakh through online payment. This data is only of the routine online offerings.”Asked about the average amount of money offered digitally every day, the official said on condition of anonymity, “Actually, the banks have not given us full details yet, citing the lockdown.”Since the lockdown hit collections of all gurdwaras, they are finding it difficult to manage their finances, and the SGPC is promoting online offerings on its website and encouraging devotees around the world to contribute online, especially for the Golden Temple’s langar ghar, considered the world’s largest community kitchen.SGPC president Gobind Singh Longowal personally appealed to devotees to contribute from home through this method. An icon appears for online donations when people visit the SGPC’s website. This icon appeals to devotees to contribute to the Golden Temple’s community kitchen that feeds the needy in Amritsar. These people include migrant workers stranded in the city and the poor.The surge in online offering has provided relief to the SGPC, which runs scores of educational, medical and sports institutions and manages historic gurdwaras in the northern part of the country.“The SGPC is extending help to every needy person in the crisis, so the devotees should come forward to contribute to these services,” said Longowal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/golden-temple-sees-20-surge-in-online-offerings-amid-lockdown/story-G2w9yXOViBcxzLVms32OXN.html
02-05-2020||India||Assam to open borders with NE states from tomorrow, except Sikkim||The Assam government will open its borders with other states in the northeast from Sunday as part of efforts to facilitate the return of residents stranded in other parts of the country.The move follows the state government’s exercise to transport people stranded within Assam by allowing inter-district movement. Since April 25, nearly 100,000 people have travelled in their own vehicles or buses to reach their homes and workplaces.“From Sunday, anyone from Assam who is at present in other northeastern states [except Sikkim] can return to the state. The state’s borders are open for them. They don’t have to register or seek permission to return,” state health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said on Saturday.People can use their own vehicles to enter Assam. They will be screened at the borders of their home districts and placed in home or institutional quarantine.“For those who don’t have own means of transport, we will send buses to pick them up within a few days. A notifications in this regard will be issued soon,” Sarma said.Assam has also launched the helpline no 7428159966 to help the return of residents of the state stranded in other parts of the country.“Those interested should give a missed call on the number. A link will be sent to them within 48 hours, which they will have to fill and send back. They will be intimated about details of their return by our teams,” Sarma said.Nearly 600,000 stranded workers from Assam who had earlier made a similar missed call to receive Rs 2,000 as financial aid will not need to call again. A link will be automatically sent to their numbers.Those who can arrange their own vehicles to return have been asked by the state government to send an email to assamtransportrelief@gmail.com to get a return pass.“There are nearly 20 lakh residents of the state who are outside at present. Those who don’t need to return now can delay their travel by a few months. We won’t put any restriction on anyone wanting to return, but bringing back so many people is a tough task and can take several weeks,” Sarma said.The state government will continue providing Rs 2,000 a month as aid to workers from the state stranded outside. Till Saturday, 255,000 stranded people had been provided this aid.The government is setting up five quarantine facilities at Kokrajhar, Guwahati, Tezpur, Jorhat and Silchar for people returning to Assam. Hotels are being included as quarantine facilities for those who don’t want to stay at state-run facilities and want to avail of paid quarantine.Sarma said the government’s move to fly back 852 patients from Assam undergoing treatment outside the state hit a roadblock after two cancer patients in Mumbai tested positive for Covid-19.The government plans to tie-up with private laboratories to boost testing for those returning to Assam.Assam has recorded 42 Covid-19 cases. One patient has died, 32 have recovered and nine are being treated. Nearly 11,000 tests were conducted till Saturday.In an interaction with a small group of journalists, chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal said his government will decide on Sunday how it will implement regulations in the red, orange and green zones.Unlike the Union home ministry’s guidelines allowing the movement of people and economic activities between 7 am and 7 pm, Assam is considering permitting these activities between 6 am and 6 pm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-to-open-borders-with-ne-states-from-tomorrow-except-sikkim/story-s3JKKUju4RuQl0nifOJAQI.html

It also advised hospitals to not insist on a Covid-19 test for all the patients coming to their hospitals.“This is not acceptable. All private hospitals and clinics are directed that every non-Covid hospital should keep a designated isolation unit to accommodate critically ill, suspected Covid patients, until their condition is stabilised for transfer to Covid hospitals after testing. The hospitals can’t insist that the patients get tested for Covid-19 before coming to their facilities,” read the order from the directorate of health services.The State health department asked every non-Covid hospital to keep a designated isolation unit to accommodate critically ill suspected Covid-19 patients until their condition is stabilised for transfer to a Covid Hospital post-testing.“In this crisis it is necessary to provide essential services. It is important not only to maintain people’s trust in the health system to deliver essential health services, but also to minimise an increase in morbidity and mortality from other health conditions,” the order added.Earlier this week, the Orissa High Court had asked the State government to ensure that no person is denied treatment for any ailment by any hospital of the government or private if such facility is available with the hospital.The HC order came following a PIL into the death of a 70-year-old Muslim man of Cuttack who died on April 10 allegedly due to denial of dialysis at a private nursing home in the city during the Covid-19 lockdown.The man was asked to procure PPE set for the doctors during dialysis and even then he could not get dialysis.Similarly, a man from Bhubaneswar died on April 27, after he was allegedly denied treatment by some private hospitals in the city. Later, the wife and daughter of the deceased spent a night on the road after their landlord reportedly did not allow them to enter.Health department officials said the order would ensure that people in Odisha do not face problems in seeking critical health services during the nationwide lockdown in place till May 17.Odisha has so far reported 156 Covid-19 cases, but officials apprehend a steep hike in the numbers once the over 6 lakh migrant workers start arriving in the state from Covid-19 hotspots like Maharashtra, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and Delhi.Earlier, the Ministry of Health had asked States to ensure continuity of service delivery mostly to pregnant women, infant and children under five and treatments for chronic diseases, communicable diseases like TB, leprosy, vector-borne diseases, requiring treatment for dialysis, cancer, blood transfusion and other special needs during the lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/can-t-insist-on-covid-19-test-before-admission-odisha-govt-to-hospitals/story-0A8d0vxFhQ3uEmfgPHcGvN.html
02-05-2020||India||Lockdown may hit sale of First Flush, Darjeeling’s premium tea, fear planters||First Flush, Darjeeling’s most premium tea may be hit by the worldwide economic slowdown and the impact of lockdown on the production of quality tea, fear planters in the famous hill district of West Bengal. With 87 gardens, the Darjeeling tea industry depends largely on the premium quality First Flush tea for sustenance, as it fetches the highest price in domestic and foreign markets. The industry employs 55,000 permanent workers, who annually produce around 8 million kilograms of different varieties of Darjeeling tea, a fraction of which is harvested in spring and comprises the First Flush. Thirty-five to 40 percent of the industry’s annual revenue is generated from the sale of First Flush, which is produced mostly between March 15 and April 15, planters said.Depending on the quality and demand, First Flush tea can fetch anything between Rs 1200 to Rs 20,000 a kg, industry insiders said.Production of First Flush requires the plucking of the finest two leaves and a bud of the tea plant. But the lockdown, which started on March 25 and was lifted for the tea industry only on April 12, resulted in the overgrowth of plants. Some tea gardens are located at lower elevations, where leaves and buds appear first. Most others are located at middle and high elevations, which witness the last harvesting subsequently; only the lower estates were able to produce their First Flush on time. “Lifting the lockdown for the tea industry, while keeping other sectors under lockdown, resulted in stockpiling of all types of tea that are produced,” Rishi Saria, Director of Gopaldhara and Rohini tea estates said. The closure of courier services meant that plantations could not send samples to their main offices which are mostly in Kolkata. So they simply harvested their varieties and stored them in warehouses. “Transporting the tea is still a problem, as courier services are not fully operational,” Saria said. Ashok Lohia, Chairman, Chamong Tea Exports Pvt Ltd, said, “There will be substantial revenue loss that comes from First Flush.” The group has 13 gardens in Darjeeling.The industry has also missed the best climatic conditions required for the premium quality First Flush, Lohia said.“We are keeping our fingers crossed. We hope the demand for First Flush tea in foreign countries remains the same,” said Lohia. Germany is one of the major buyers among European countries, he added. Binod Mohan, Chairman, Darjeeling Tea Association is worried about the consequences of the industry being unable to produce premium First Flush this season.“In the coming days, this may affect the demand for First Flush in the international market as there can be high economic recession. This may lead to distress sale. Also, we ensured quality in the past, but the lockdown has affected that too,” Mohan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lockdown-may-hit-sale-of-first-flush-darjeeling-s-premium-tea-fear-planters/story-0Vk7Ho15fo1dpAaU43x15J.html
02-05-2020||India||In PM’s push for farm reforms, a role for Kisan credit cards, PM-KISAN scheme||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday held a meeting with ministers and government officials to discuss ways to boost the agriculture sector in India as the country looks to rebound from the economic setback dealt by coronavirus outbreak. The government’s focus is on making strategic interventions in the existing marketing eco-system for the farm sector and bringing appropriate reforms in the context of rapid agricultural development.A government release said that this would be achieved by further strengthening Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs) and by developing ‘Brand India’ in the sector that would contribute to boosting agricultural exports.“PM Narendra Modi holds a meeting to discuss ways to boost the agriculture sector; emphasises on the dissemination of technology till the last mile and making farmers more competitive in the global value chain,” said a release by the government.The prime minister has been stressing on boosting exports to aid economic growth. The meeting also discussed ways to make several government instruments for the sector including the Kisan Credit Cards, PM-KISAN and e-Nam even more effective and increase their contribution to farmer welfare.Kisan Credit Cards offer short-term credit limits for crops and term loans to holders by participating banks including cooperatives. This initiative grants farmers access to formal banking networks. KCC credit cardholders are also eligible for personal accident insurance for death and permanent disability.Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) is a scheme started by the Narendra Modi government in 2018 that provides income support of Rs.6000/- per year to all farmer families across the country. The sum is paid in three equal installments of Rs.2000/- each every four months.National Agriculture Market or eNAM is another initiative to modernize the farming sector with a tool that helps farmers in discovering the best price for their produce. It (eNAM) is an online trading platform for agricultural commodities that brings farmers, traders and buyers at one place.Saturday’s meeting, which also discussed ways to invigorate the agriculture sector with modern technology, comes in the backdrop of appeals by the prime minister for self-reliance in a post-coronavirus world and for attracting foreign investments by offering a favourable environment aided by government policy, infrastructural and technological advancement.India readies to enter the third phase of nationwide lockdown from May 4, which will see a graded resumption of economic activities across the country. The government has given total exemptions to the agriculture sector in all zones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-pm-modi-s-push-for-agricultural-reforms-a-role-for-kisan-credit-cards-pm-kisan-scheme/story-uSV3GuPoxHOCvV7mzXAMXK.html

Four civilians and three soldiers were injured in the indiscriminate firing of shells from across the LoC on Friday, the army said.Army spokesman Colonel Rajesh Kalia said that the two soldiers, who were injured in a ceasefire violation in the Rampur sector on Friday, died on Saturday. “Army salutes the sacrifice of the soldiers,” he said.The injured four civilians, including a four-year-old boy, are undergoing treatment in two hospitals in Uri and Baramulla.Locals said no fresh shelling was reported in their area since Friday night. A couple of houses were also damaged, when shells and mortars landed close to the houses at Churunda village on the LoC in the Haji peer sector. This is the second time in the last fortnight when Indian and Pakistani troopers exchanged fire on the LoC in the Uri sector amid the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.Indian Army has been using heavy artillery to respond to Pakistan’s recent ceasefire violations. In April, three civilians were killed in two villages in north Kashmir’s Kupwara district, when shells fired from across the LoC landed close to an army camp in Panzgam.In March, Indian and Pakistani troops had exchanged fire in the Uri sector in which one house was damaged. The mortar shells had landed in Mothal, Silikote, Hatlanga, and Churunda villages on the LoC.Indian Army has blamed Pakistan for ceasefire violations in a bid to help militants infiltrate into Kashmir since the revocation of Article 370 on August 5, 2019. Top army officials have warned that militants are waiting at various launch pads across the LoC to sneak into Kashmir.Villagers living on the LoC have been demanding the construction of underground bunkers, where they could take refuge during shelling that has intensified in the past year.Pakistan has violated the ceasefire around 1,400 times this year to date. While the corresponding figure for 2018 and 2019 was 1,629 and 3,168, respectively.Defence minister Rajnath Singh last week had urged the top military commanders to ensure the country’s adversary is not allowed to exploit the ongoing healthcare emergency due to Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/srinagar-two-soldiers-injured-in-shelling-along-loc-succumb-at-base-hospital/story-4NbnsJuvQprom9cWr3TCNN.html

The deceased sustained multiple injuries including on the head,” said Kachawa.The accused dumped Gurjar, after thrashing him, in an isolated place near Angai police chowki.“On April 25, the villagers spotted Gurjar lying in the open in an unconscious state and informed his family members, who, then took him to a local hospital from where he was referred to Dholpur district hospital, which referred him further to a private hospital in Gwalior,” added Kachawa.On April 30, Gurjar succumbed to his injuries while undergoing treatment at the private hospital. Following his death, the family members lodged a complaint against the accused at Sarmathura police station.“Police has visited the spot and the statements of the family members of the deceased have been recorded.

02-05-2020||India||More than 800 workers head home to UP from Nashik on special train||More than 800 workers from Uttar Pradesh who were stranded in Nashik in Maharashtra, boarded a special train for Lucknow on Saturday, UP’s Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Awanish Awasthi“The first special train for Uttar Pradesh has started from Nashik (Maharashtra) today morning & around 845 labourers and workers have boarded the train. They will reach Lucknow tomorrow,” Awasthi said according to ANI.On Friday, the government allowed the railways to run special trains to ferry students, migrant workers stranded in various parts of the country due to nationwide lockdown to check the spread of coronavirus.The decision to allow special trains came following the requests of several states to evacuate migrant workers. Earlier this week, the Union home ministry while relaxing the guidelines, allowed the evacuation of stranded people only by buses.On Thursday, the Uttar Pradesh government had said that it would launch a massive evacuation drive to bring back migrant workers from Gujarat, Uttarakhand and Rajasthan in the next few days.Awasthi had then said that chief minister Yogi Adityanath had directed senior officers to prepare a plan to evacuate migrant workers from Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Uttarakhand and Rajasthan who have been stranded due to the lockdown.Earlier this month, the UP government had evacuated over 10,000 students from Kota. It also evacuated thousands of workers from Delhi NCR in the first week of the lockdown towards the end of March.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/more-than-800-workers-head-home-to-up-from-nashik-on-special-train/story-McuaS6DQCEcG85RqlDwU3M.html
02-05-2020||India||Did novel coronavirus strain change form in India? ICMR to study mutation||The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) is planning to study whether the novel coronavirus strain in India has undergone mutation while spreading within the country over the last two months.According to a senior scientist of the country’s apex health research body, determining whether or not the SARS-CoV2 strain has changed form will help in ensuring the effectiveness of a potential vaccine. “The study will also indicate whether it has become more virulent and increased transmission capability.” Samples will be collected from COVID-19 patients to study whether the novel coronavirus strain has mutated or not, he said.However, the study can begin once the lockdown is lifted since currently there are difficulties involved in transportation of samples from different states and Union Territories, scientists said.As per Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID), so far the maximum difference in the novel coronavirus strain in India has been found to be between 0.2 to 0.9 per cent as compared to the strains in other countries, another scientist said.GISAID, which promotes international sharing of all influenza virus sequences and related clinical and epidemiological data, has over 7,000 complete genome sequences of SARS-CoV2 deposited by various laboratories across the world where they have classified the virus based on their mutations.There are chances that people arriving in India from different countries are bringing various strains of the virus.Three strains of the virus have been traced in India so far. One was from Wuhan, and the other two from Italy and Iran. The sequence of the coronavirus strain from Iran was similar to that of China.“It will take some time for us to know the predominant quasi-species of the novel coronavirus in the country. But mutations are not likely to make potential vaccines ineffective, as all sub-types of the virus have the same enzymes. Also, it has been in India for three months and it does not mutate very fast,” Head of Epidemiology and Communicable Diseases at ICMR Dr Raman R Gangakhedkar had said earlier.Six Indian companies are working on a vaccine for COVID-19, joining the global race to find a preventive for the deadly infection spreading rapidly across the world.Nearly 70 ‘vaccine candidates’ are being tested and at least three have moved to the human clinical trial stage, but a vaccine for the novel coronavirus is unlikely to be ready for mass use before 2021.India has also collaborated with WHO’s multi-country “solidarity trial” for developing potential treatments and drugs for COVID-19.The death toll due to COVID-19 rose to 1,218 and the number of cases climbed to 37,336 in the country on Saturday, according to the Union Health Ministry The number of active COVID-19 cases stood at 26,167, while 9,950 people have recovered and one patient has migrated.

The central government should reconsider this decision. In this hour of disaster, it is an injustice to the labour colleagues returning back home,” tweeted the CM.The Indian Railways are running “Shramik specials” to ferry stranded students, migrant workers stuck in various parts of the country due to the coronavirus outbreak and nationwide lockdown in place. The ticket fare on these trains includes the price of regular sleeper class tickets plus superfast charges of Rs 30 and an additional charge of Rs 20.“This includes meals and drinking water for long-distance trains. State governments will coordinate and can pay on passengers’ behalf,” the ministry clarified.The railway ministry said that trains would operate from point-to-point on the request of the concerned state governments. Senior officials would be appointed as nodal officers. “The passengers have to be screened by the sending states and only those found asymptomatic will be allowed to travel,” the ministry added. It would also be the responsibility of the sending governments to bring such individuals to the designated stations in sanitised buses, following social distancing norms. All passengers will have to mandatorily wear masks while undertaking the journey.Five such trains operated on Friday. It was the first time any passenger rail services operated in the country since they were suspended on March 22.The government emphasised that this was being done on May 1, the Labour Day. Millions of migrant workers have been struggling after the lockdown was announced, facing a shortage of food and income, and have been seeking to go back home hundreds of kilometres away, including by foot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/injustice-cm-soren-on-rs-50-extra-charged-per-migrant-on-special-trains/story-mlsYdMiPrXuxfUDMVCnKgK.html
02-05-2020||India||Covid-19 +ve woman gives birth, breastfeeds baby wearing gloves, masks, PPE||A 24-year-old woman from Howrah district who tested positive for Covid-19 on April 13 and gave birth to a son on April 20, has recovered and was discharged from the hospital on May 1.She lost her father-in-law to Covid-19, the day she herself tested positive. Her brother in-law, who too, had tested positive, is still in hospital. The nursing staff and doctors named the child Armaan, which in Arabic, means hope.At the time of discharge on Friday, all staff at the hospital gave the mother and the child a standing ovation and sang ‘Ami Bhoy Korbo Na’ (I won’t be scared), an iconic song composed by Rabindranath Tagore for them.The mother and the child were kept in the same room, to help build the bond, but at a distance of six feet to prevent any infection from spreading to the child. At the time of breastfeeding, the nursing mother wore masks, sunglasses, gloves and her whole body was sanitized. She wore Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) whenever the baby was brought to her. “Doctors and nurses took extraordinary care of my child and me. I was very worried that breastfeeding could spread the infection to the child, but doctors and nurses kept assuring me, that all necessary care had been taken,” said the woman. “Thoughts of my children kept me strong,” she added.She was released after her test reports dated April 27 and 30 indicated negative. She has been told to remain in home quarantine for 14 days. State health department officials will monitor the family’s health periodically. Her husband, a 30-year-old, lost parts of both of his hands during an accident while working on a machine at an industrial unit in 2017. Her first child, a four-year-old son, has been in an institutional quarantine centre along with her husband, because the woman and her father-in-law tested positive. “It feels great to finally reunite with my family. In the hospital, the thought of my baby kept me strong, even though my father-in-law’s death caused panic and worry. How the man who hardly stepped out of home, got infected by the virus, remains a mystery. I was keen to watch my newborn all day, but at the same time concerned about his well-being,” she said after reaching home on Friday evening. According to a doctor at the hospital, the expected date of her delivery was May 7, but labour pains set in suddenly on April 20. The child was delivered normally and has fared well since birth. Subhashis Mitra, director of Sanjivani Hospital at Uluberia in Howrah district, says that the case of the Covid-19 positive expectant mother was carefully dealt with, given the unprecedented situation of a baby needing protection from its mother’s disease. “Protecting the baby from the infection was a challenge, and a great deal of care was taken in this regard.

Normally, fresh tenders would have been called by now for awarding of the contract to the agency which bids the lowest amount for manpower supply. Because of the lockdown, the TTD trust board could not meet and finalise the tender,” TTD official spokesman T Ravi told HT.The board says since the last contract ended on April 30, the services of all the 1,300 contract workers were also terminated from May 1. “Everything was done as per the rules. Moreover, there is no work for these workers now, because of the lockdown, all guest houses are closed,” Ravi said.It may be mentioned that the Union ministry of labour had issued an advisory before enforcing the lockdown on May 24, asking all employers not to terminate employees, particularly casual or contractual workers, and also not to reduce their wages.The decision of the TTD came as a rude shock to the contractual employees, who gathered at the temple trust board’s head office in Tirupati to protest.“It is not our fault that the lockdown was imposed. The TTD should continue with us on humanitarian grounds,” a woman refusing to identify herself, said.TTD trust board chairman Y V Subba Reddy had a talk with the terminated employees and assured to look into the issue on humanitarian grounds. He told HT that the board would recommend to the prospective manpower agency to take the outgoing contract workers on rolls.He said even the regular employees of TTD had no work since the lockdown was announced and only skeletal staff was attending to the essentials.The famous Lord Venkateshwara temple in Tirumala is closed for pilgrims since March 20, but the daily rituals are going on as per the temple traditions.Interestingly, the Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy government in Andhra Pradesh launched Andhra Pradesh Corporation for Outsourced Services (APCOS) in November last. It would act as a placement agency for the supply of manpower to various public and private sector companies.The terminated outsourced workers of the TTD are planning to approach APCOS shortly, a senior employee in the TTD familiar with the development said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-richest-temple-in-tirupati-lays-off-1300-contractual-employees/story-ESt1VPo3ImwT7cj7tYp6iI.html

By the end of the second spell of the lockdown, this figure increased to 30 districts even as the number of infections grew rapidly in the past 10 days.The number of infections in Bihar was just 66 on April 14, and it increased to 475 on May 2, with 243 cases reported between April 25 and May 1.“This shows the challenging phase for the state may have just begun, with more and more people returning to their hometowns and we have to be prepared for it,” said a senior state government official who declined to be named.The state government has already curtailed all leave for doctors, health officials and contractual employees of the health department till May 31 in view of growing need for surveillance and screening. But officials admit the challenges for Bihar might grow.Over the next few days, tens of thousands of migrant workers are expected to return to the state in special trains from different parts of the country.Officials are also worried because many new infections reported during the second phase of the lockdown were those of migrant workers, who managed to reach Bihar and unknowingly took the Coronavirus to new areas as they were largely asymptomatic.Also read| ‘Injustice’: CM Soren on Rs 50 extra charged per migrant on special trainsDistricts in north Bihar such as Madhubani, Darbhanga, Sitamarhi and Purnea had remained free of infections until the last week of April, but now they all have reported cases. Madhubani, with 13 cases reported on Friday alone, has emerged as the district in north Bihar with highest number of 18 cases.Neighbouring Darbhanga has five cases, while Sitamarhi has six. East and West Champaran have five cases each, while Seemanchal region too has reported cases – one each in Purnea and Araria and two in Katihar. Madhubani and Darbhanga are both in the orange zone.Madhubani’s district magistrate Nilesh Ramchandra Deor, a doctor, said all 13 cases in the district were migrant workers who returned from Delhi, Mumbai and Lucknow. Five earlier cases were traced to a woman who travelled by car from Delhi.“Due to her, another woman who also travelled in the car, and two children got infected,” he said.Also read: After CM declares state ‘coronavirus-free’, Tripura records two new Covid-19 casesMadhubani shares a border with Nepal and the inflow of migrant workers from the neighbouring country too is likely to increase. This has led to greater concerns for officials of the district, famous for its exquisite paintings and rich cultural heritage, and surveillance, screening and quarantine facilities have been expanded.“There is lockdown in Nepal till May 7. People are not coming from that side and if anyone tries to sneak in, it is immediately detected due to heightened surveillance. All outsiders have to spend the required time in quarantine.

The students from Bihar had even observed a fast and protested on the streets to pressure the state government.Kota’s district collector Om Kasera said on Saturday: “The decks have been cleared for the return of around 9,000 students of Bihar from Kota and they will be sent through special trains between May 3 and May 6.”A total of 1,000 students from Jharkhand left Kota in a special train on Friday night and more students from the state will be sent back on another special train on Saturday night, he said.Reacting to the development, Rishu Raj, a 21-year-old from Bihar’s Navada district who plans to appear for the NEET, said: “I am feeling very relieved after the decision to send students of Bihar through trains”“Had the decision been taken earlier, it would have benefited both students and government,” he said.Another teenage student from Bihar’s Betiya district, who didn’t want to be named, said, “I am feeling very delighted after hearing the news that we can pack our bags to go home.

It said time has now come to grow wiser.“Congress leader Rahul Gandhi held talks with economist Raghuram Rajan through digital medium. Rajan said that the government needs to spend Rs 65000 crore to help the poor facing hardships due to the coronavirus lockdown. He said the entire country will have to face the economic consequences of lockdown,” the Sena said.“Rajan said the government’s present definition of the poor will change after lockdown. Middle class and upper middle class will also become poor and start demanding certificate of economic backwardness. Even a developed nation like the US is staring at a grave problem of unemployment.“In the US, there is system of unemployment allowance, which India doesn’t have. Rajan’s observation is that 10 crore people in India will become jobless, which is a matter of concern,” the party said.Through their talks, one thing became clear that continuing lockdown for indefinte period will prove costly for the economy. The government will have to work beyond the set norms. Power and authority to take decisions cannot remain limited with only a couple of people, the Uddhav Thackeray-led party said.As far as Maharashtra is concerned, the 2019-20 revenue income is Rs 3.15 lakh crore, while the expenditure is Rs 3.35 lakh crore. But due to lockdown the revenue deficit will grow and it would become difficult to run the state, it added.“The central government will have to take everyone along. It will have to take into account others’ views and chart out the road ahead,” it said.“In India, all political parties should work towards bringing the economy back on track, instead of playing politics of India-Pakistan, religion and caste. The prime minister should take a lead and the entire country will stand behind him,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shiv-sena-says-raghuram-rajan-s-10-crore-indians-to-go-jobless-claim-concerning/story-OAJShmzRCIu7prq4WuaYfK.html

02-05-2020||India||‘Criminal waste’: Congress attacks Central Vista project after it got clearances amid coronavirus lockdown||The Congress party on Saturday launched a fresh tirade against the Central Vista project after it emerged that it received two key clearances in the last few days despite suggestions to shelve the costly project in view of the economic challenges presented by coronavirus pandemic outbreak.Senior Congress leader Anand Sharma urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to halt the project for now, along with the proposed mega central secretariats in 17 state capitals, calling it a “criminal waste” of public money in the times of coronavirus pandemic.“Urging PM to shelve the wasteful Central Vista project & proposed mega Central secretariats at 17 state capitals. Spending over Rs 25,000 crore on grand buildings at a time of unprecedented national crisis will be a criminal waste of public money,” a tweet by Sharma said.The Central Vista project includes a new parliament building that alone is estimated to cost in excess of Rs 900 crores. It also involves makeover of the three km stretch housing government offices between the Rashtrapati Bhavan and the India Gate.The opposition parties have sought the scrapping of the project citing the economic burden placed by the coronavirus outbreak.In the past few days, the project, however, received two key approvals, including from the environment ministry’s expert appraisal committee and the Central Vista committee, taking it a step closer to reality.Several external experts on the Central Vista committee had requested for a deferment in the meeting to grant approval to the project, however, the government went ahead citing its importance and the time-scale for its implementation as reasons.Raising his objection, Sharma said India needed to commit resources to building of hospitals right now.“We face severe resource crunch and accepting World Bank and ADB loans. India needs hospitals and commit the resources there,” he advised.Another senior Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi questioned the two clearances for the project when a second fiscal relief package to mitigate the hardships faced by several sectors of economy and individuals was yet to be announced. “The lockdown has been extended for a second time and a new parliament building has been approved, but there is still no sign of a second financial package to support industries. Does the BJP Govt care at all?”The Congress party has opposed the Central Vista project from the very beginning and has repeatedly questioned the rationale for revamping the iconic structures dating back to the British rule. “We have a direct question, whose stamp will this project bear?

02-05-2020||India||Non-Covid patients in Bengal suffer as most doctors stop private practice||An excruciating toothache and swollen gums have been giving Nilanjan Chakraborty, a resident of Gariahat in south Kolkata, sleepless nights. On Friday, he called up a dental surgeon and tried his best to describe his symptoms. But the medicine prescribed by the surgeon did not work and Chakraborty had to ring another doctor.From Kolkata to remote areas in north and south Bengal, people suffering from chronic diseases or sudden ailments are having a tough time, as a large section of private practitioners have stopped seeing patients.“In a town like ours, people depend on traditional doctors’ chambers,” said veteran folk singer Swapna Chakraborty, a resident of Suri town in Birbhum district, using a term common in Bengal for private clinics. “Most are closed. Luckily, a few doctors from a clinic are attending to house calls,” she said. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday urged all doctors to continue with private practice while maintaining social distancing norms. Doctors, however, say this may expose more people, including themselves, to danger.“The Medical Council of India has prescribed consultations over the phone and via videoconference for a good reason. The problem with opening small clinics and doctor’s chambers in the districts is that most of these facilities are small and have little or no infrastructure to ensure social distancing, screening of patients, recording travel history and no availability of personal protection equipment (PPE), N95 masks etc for doctors. The state government has itself issued an order saying PPEs are a must for doctors in non-emergency wards at hospitals,” said Dr Koushik Chaki, secretary, West Bengal Doctors Forum.“We mentioned these before the chief minister at a meeting on April 28. Doctors are ready to continue their private practice, but who will ensure that it does not lead to a social pandemonium? Also, who will bear the additional cost of PPEs, etc?” Dr Chaki added.Among doctors, dental surgeons and eye and ENT specialists feel the most vulnerable, as they come closest to a patient’s face.“The Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons of India has said in a guideline, that surgeons and their staff have to use protective gear and sanitize the operation theatre after every procedure. Also, there has to be a restriction on appointments to avoid crowding. As a doctor, my conscience does not allow me to pass the additional expenditure on to my patients, but how long can I bear it?” said Dr Rajarshi Banerjee, a dental and maxillofacial surgeon. In the absence of an adequate number of PPE kits, ENT surgeon Dr Atri Banerjee, who visits a private clinic in south Kolkata, has been wearing three gowns while seeing patients. “The eye protection gear available in the market is more like the ones worn by the bikers. Face covering headgear is in short supply. I undertook only three operations since the lockdown began, and non-emergency procedures were postponed. We cannot continue like this for long,” said Dr Banerjee.Big private hospital chains, too, are facing problems. “Around 40 per cent of our doctors are visiting the outpatient departments (OPDs) in rotation. Patients have been given the option of consulting doctors via video conference. Those coming to our hospitals are being spread across different lounges and waiting rooms in the hospital, to ensure distancing,” said a spokesperson of AMRI Hospitals where the state’s first Covid-19 death was recorded. “People who live in Kolkata, at least have several options, despite the restrictions. We in small towns, however, are primarily dependent on private practitioners and they have stopped seeing patients,” said Dipankar Ghosh, a resident of Midnapore town.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/non-covid-patients-in-bengal-suffer-as-most-doctors-stop-private-practice/story-Aak84dSq19SsvvS3E9R0qM.html

The last group that returned to Pakistan in April was much smaller and comprised people staying in Delhi, Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh.The repatriation exercise on Tuesday covers 193 individuals living in 25 districts of 10 states: Maharashtra, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab and Delhi.Most of them would begin their road trip to Punjab’s Attari on Saturday or Sunday.Some of them would be on the road for the next two days. Like the small group that will begin the 1,700 km road trip from Bengal’s Kolkata on Sunday morning.“It is requested that all returning Pakistan nationals may be screened as per international norms and existing provisions of the Government of India and only asymptomatic individuals may be allowed to return,” Dammu Ravi, additional secretary at the external affairs ministry said in his communication to the state governments.Government officials, however, explain that the health screening is not enough to determine the Covid-19 status of a person.In March, some customs officials and security personnel at the Attari-Wagah crossing were placed in quarantine after reports in the Pakistani media that two of a five-member group, allowed to cross the border as a special case, had tested positive.In April again, some officials posted at the border were again quarantined after similar reports emerged after the return of 41 Pakistani nationals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-permits-193-pak-nationals-to-return-on-may-5-asks-states-to-help-them/story-eKagOZaa3RQLplFjglN9KO.html

Here’s how life will be in these cities till at least May 17.Am I allowed travel for non-essential activities within the city?A government order issued on Friday says movement of persons for non-essential activities is strictly prohibited between 7pm and 7am across the country. On the flip side, an interpretation of this is such travels are allowed between 7am and 7pm. The federal order, however, empowers states and Union Territories to issue area-specific restrictions to stop the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) whenever and wherever they deem fitSo does that mean I can take a walk/go for a run between 7am and 7pm?Technically, yes. But it will also depend on your state-, city-specific guidelines, if they have been issuedIs my domestic help allowed to come to work?Another interpretation of the order banning non-essential travel between 7pm and 7am is that domestic helps are allowed during the dayAm I allowed to visit a friend?Again, an interpretation is such a visit is not banned between 7am and 7pm. However, it will depend largely on city-specific guidelines. Importantly, the central order separately bans social, religious and political gatherings across the countryAre private vehicles allowed in my city?In red zones, the government says, the movement of vehicles is allowed for “permitted activities”, but with just two passengers besides the driver. Pillion-riding is not allowed for two-wheelersWhat about public transport?If you are living in a red zone, you won’t get a bus. Cycle rickshaws and auto-rickshaws, too, are not allowed.

In green zones, buses can operate with up to 50% of seating capacityAre app-based cab aggregators allowed?Service providers such as Ola and Uber are not allowed in red zones.

02-05-2020||India||Hyderabad’s Covid-19 warriors come together to feed starving street dogs amid lockdown||Earlier this month, while B Manohar, a senior bureaucrat in the Telangana government was on his morning walk on the campus of Osmania University closer to his residence, he noticed carcasses of a few stray dogs along the walking path.“It was a pathetic scene. I realised that these canines are dying of starvation as no food was available to them due to the closure of university hostels and canteens on the account of the lockdown to avoid the spread of Covid-19,” Manohar, managing director of Telangana State Tourism Development Corporation, said.These dogs used to survive on the leftover food from the canteens and even university employees and students in the hostels used to provide them with food. Now, there is no such facility, resulting in their starvation, he pointed out.From the very next day, Manohar and others who take a morning stroll at the campus started carrying leftover food from their homes to feed the dogs. “Somehow, it has given me immense satisfaction,” Manohar said.Like Manohar, several animal lovers in Hyderabad have been taking care of street dogs that have been starving during the lockdown period.“For poor people and daily-wage workers who are suffering due to the lockdown, the government is supplying food one way or the other. Several NGOs are also working round-the-clock to supply food for them. But not many are bothered about street dogs which are not getting any food due to the closure of restaurants and hotels,” R Vasantha, a scientist from Prof Jayashankar Agricultural University, Rajendra Nagar, said.Vasantha, an animal lover associated with the Kindness Club at Attapur, has also been supplying food to nearly 250-300 dogs every day, along with her friends in the club, during the lockdown period. “Many people brought to my notice that scores of dogs and puppies are dying due to lack of food. So, we have been supplying nutritious feed to these dogs,” she said.The food for dogs is made of cooked rice mixed with milk, dog-food power, eggs and soya granules. “Our volunteers carry the food in buckets and place it in earthen or cement bowls at around 8 pm and sometimes during the early hours of the day. We are happy to see these street dogs developing a lot of attachment to all of us,” Vasantha said.The dog lovers also visit far off places after duly taking permission from the police to supply food to the dogs in those areas.“We have three vehicles – two for carrying food to street dogs and another to provide medicines for dogs which have fallen sick during the lockdown period. We also collect dog feed from good Samaritans, including rice, soya, breads and biscuits,” said Dattatreya Joshi, convenor of People for Animals, a voluntary organisation working on animal welfare.He said, like humans, street dogs too have emotions. “In situations like the present lockdown, they too are suffering and starving without food like the poor people. We cannot ignore their sufferings and let us do whatever we can to mitigate their hunger,” Joshi said.According to him, there are more than a lakh street dogs within GHMC limits. Since the NGOs cannot reach out to all parts of the city, he appeals to the people to take care of the needs of the dogs in their respective areas.The Cyberabad police have also joined hands with these NGO activists in serving street dogs. According to the Society for Cyberabad Security Council, a joint initiative of the Cyberabad police with the IT industry, the police and NGO activists are feeding 1500 street dogs daily in one part of the city or the other. They also purchased 300 pots which are placed in different areas and filled with water for the street dogs.Cyberabad police commissioner V C Sajjanar said dogs become aggressive due to the lack of water and food. “We need to shower the same affection on beings who cannot speak. A total of 100 volunteers are working for the cause,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hyderabad-s-covid-19-warriors-come-together-to-feed-starving-street-dogs-amid-lockdown/story-0xaFScNmXR3M4h1sH2ZvwM.html
02-05-2020||India||During coronavirus lockdown 3.0, people can’t step out for 12 hours||The government has extended the current nationwide lockdown due to end on May 3 by another two weeks and issued a new set of guidelines for the “well being and safety” of people in the red, orange and green zones.The Union ministry of home affairs (MHA) has said several activities, including travel by air, rail, metro and inter-state movement by road, schools, colleges and other educational and training or coaching institutions, hospitality services other than those used for housing health, police and government officials won’t be permitted “irrespective of zone”.However, it said rail and road movement will be allowed for “select purposes”, and for purposes as permitted by it. An official clarified planes or trains could be allowed for carrying medical officers or an air ambulance or if troops have to be ferried etc.“The new guidelines also prescribe certain measures for well being and safety of persons. Hence, movement of individuals, for all non-essential activities, shall remain strictly prohibited between 7 pm to 7 am,” it also said.The MHA has directed local authorities to issue orders under appropriate provisions of law—such as prohibitory orders [curfew] under Section 144 of CrPC—for this purpose, and ensure strict compliance.However, senior citizens above 65 years of age, those with co-morbidities, pregnant women, and children below the age of 10 years, in all zones will have to to stay at home. The only exception to this rule is for meeting essential requirements and health purposes.In containment zones, out-patient departments (OPDs) and medical clinics shall not be permitted to operate. However, these may be permitted to operate in red, orange and green zones.The decision to extend the lockdown by two more weeks after May 3, when the second phase of these restrictions was scheduled to end, came amid a continuous rise in the number of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases across states, including in major metropolitans, with the nationwide tally crossing 35,000. The death toll has crossed 1,100.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/during-lockdown-3-0-people-can-t-step-out-for-12-hours/story-sNLtp9M7EXswU74YdtrYHJ.html

02-05-2020||India||Manipur black rice gets Geographical Indication tag||Manipur black rice, popularly known as ‘Chakhao’ by the locals, has bagged the Geographical Indication (GI) tag, according to official sources.The Geographical Indications Registry website also confirmed the report of registering Chakhao in the name of ‘Manipur black rice’ on their official website.The application for Chakhao was filed by the Consortium of Producers of Chakhao (Black Rice), Manipur and was facilitated by the Department of Agriculture, Government of Manipur and the North Eastern Regional Agricultural Marketing Corporation Limited.It took more than a year for the registration process including documentation by the team members of the state agriculture department, according to officials. The GI status is an indication that identifies goods as produced from a particular area which has special quality attributable to its geographical origin. GI has great potential to play a major role in trade and there is a possibility of preserving many traditional skills.On getting the registration, project coordinator MS Khaidem of Manipur Small Farmers’ Agri-Business Consortium said, “Now we can sell seeds as well as grains to any parts of the globe. We will get loyalty if anyone wants to do trading.”At some point of time, some farming communities of the state had expressed their concern over the reports of cultivating and harvesting the rice variety in other parts of the country after the seeds were transported for various purposes.Chakhao, a scented glutinous rice which has been in cultivation in Manipur over centuries, is characterised by its special aroma. It is normally eaten during community feasts and is also served as Chakhao kheer.Chakhao has also been used by traditional medical practitioners as part of traditional medicine. It is sold at Rs 100-120 a kilogram on an average in the Imphal market.“Now we are targeting to take up the GI process for a high protein content local pea variety-Hawai-Tharak Makhyatmubi,” MS Khaidem added. This local pea variety is sold double the price of other pea varieties in Manipur markets.In March 2015, Kachai Lemon(Citrus jambheri Lush), a unique lemon variety which contains 45-51 mg/100 ml ascorbic acid - the highest so far available in the realm of citrus - has been accorded GI registration tag. The lemon grows at Kachai village in Manipur’s Ukhrul’s district. Other lemon varieties have only 45-51 ascorbic acid mg/100 ml of juice||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/manipur-black-rice-gets-geographical-indication-tag/story-Y3ua6KUzRewrFilcu1823L.html

02-05-2020||India||Liquor shops owners prepare for ‘contactless’ sales as stores open from May 4||The Centre on Friday allowed the sale of liquor in standalone wine stores as well as the sale of paan/gutkha and other tobacco products across the country from May 4 except in Covid-19 containment zones. The government has categorized all 733 districts across the country in three zones – red (hotspots), orange (having a limited number of Covid-19 cases) and green (no cases). There are, however, strict social distancing norms in place. People going to such stores/shops will have to maintain at least six feet distance from each other and ensure that not more than five persons are present at a shop at any given time. Spitting in public places will be punishable.Liquor and paan shops inside malls or marketplaces are not allowed to operate yet. Containment zones are those areas in red and orange zones that have been sealed due to a high number of Covid-19 infections. Only essential activities are permitted in these areas.The government order on lockdown on Friday stated that any person violating the lockdown measures or directives could be prosecuted under the Disaster Management Act and the Indian Penal Code.The government had prohibited sale of liquor and paan/gutkha since March 24, when the first phase of lockdown was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Since then, several states including Kerala, West Bengal and Punjab had repeatedly urged the central government to lift the ban on sale of liquor citing depletion of state revenues. Liquor is one of the major contributors to states’ coffers.The International Spirits and Wines Association of India (ISWAI), which has Diageo India, Pernod Ricard, Beam Suntory, Bacardi and others as members, had asked the union consumer affairs ministry to allow shops to sell the alcoholic beverages for some hours during the day.Another body, the Confederation of Indian Alcoholic Beverages Companies (CIABC), had also asked the government to allow sale of liquor citing huge losses.ISWAI chairman Amrit Kiran Singh told Hindustan Times, “We have committed to the government that social distancing will be maintained at the liquor vends. As soon as the latest guidelines come into force, we will begin a programme called ‘Safe Shield’ under which signs will be put outside all shops about social distancing, sanitisers would be placed, there will be ‘contactless’ sales through trays kept at the counter.”Singh added that the second phase of ‘Safe Shield’ is to use services of online delivery platforms like Swiggy and Zomato for delivery of bottles for which, he said, ISWAI is trying to convince the state governments. “This will release the load off the retail stores”.75% percent of India’s liquor market size is in retail while 25% is in bar sales, which stands prohibited. Last year, liquor sales brought in Rs 2.84 lakh crore revenue to state governments, according to Singh. “Covid-19 is going to stay for some time so we have to institutionalize ‘Safe Shield’ and home delivery measures into liquor retail sales. If we do this properly, 75% of revenue to states can come back,” he added.A senior home ministry official, who didn’t want to be named, explained on Friday that “the decision to reopen standalone liquor stores across all three zones has been taken as part of resuming economic activity which is directly linked to the revenues of the states. The state governments are free to decide where they want to open the liquor stores/paan shops”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-update-sale-of-liquor-tobacco-shops-to-resume-from-may-4-conditions-apply/story-cv3nZUuTi2QNhdXrYW8ZJL.html
02-05-2020||India||Railways to charge for ferrying migrants in special trains amid Covid-19 lockdown||The Indian Railways has decided to charge for tickets for operating special trains for stranded migrant workers amid coronavirus lockdown. The fare includes the price of regular sleeper class tickets plus superfast charges of Rs 30 and an additional charge of Rs 20.“This includes meals and drinking water for long-distance trains. State governments will coordinate and can pay on passengers’ behalf, “ the ministry clarified.The Centre on Friday gave its nod for migrant workers, students and others stranded in different parts of the country to return home by special trains that will be run by the Indian Railways, expanding the scope of an earlier order that said such transportation can happen only by buses.On the occasion of Labour Day on May 1, the government decided to run “Shramik Special” trains to transport migrant workers, pilgrims, tourists, students and others stuck across the country due to the lockdown triggered by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak, the ministry said.The ministry will designate nodal officers to coordinate with states and Union territories, the Home Ministry said. Soon after, the railways ministry released detailed guidelines on social-distancing norms to be followed at stations and inside the trains. The guidelines on the sale of tickets are expected soon.The railways said six special trains had been scheduled to run on Friday as per the demands received from various state governments. The scheduled trains on Friday are Lingampally, Telangana to Hatia, Jharkhand; Aluva, Kerala to Bhubaneswar, Odisha; Nasik, Maharashtra to Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh; Nasik to Bhopal, Jaipur to Patna and Kota to Hatia.State officials in Kota, Rajasthan issued an instruction that said that students needed to carry identity cards and seats will be allotted on a first-come-first-serve basis. Messages from the district magistrate allowing travel will be considered as a valid ticket.“Please clarify to the public that these special trains are planned for nominated people identified and registered by state governments. No one under any circumstance should come to Railway Stations looking for trains. We will not issue any tickets to any individual or entertain any request from any group or individual. We will allow only those passengers to board whom state government officials bring to the railway stations,” the railway ministry clarified.Students from all 24 districts of Jharkhand who are in Rajasthan were to be accommodated in two special trains leaving Kota and Jaipur around 9 pm on Friday.The Centre has been under pressure from states for operating special trains to rescue stranded migrants and students. States including Punjab, Bihar, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Jharkhand and Kerala had asked the Centre to run special trains. Bihar deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar on Thursday appealed to the Centre for special trains to bring back migrants, the stand was reiterated by National Democratic Alliance government ally JDU as well.Thousands of migrants were stranded in places across the country since the nationwide lockdown was enforced on March 25. On Wednesday, the MHA allowed states to ferry their migrants back in buses, even as many chief ministers requested that special trains be allowed to run. States have also reached out to the Centre to seek monetary support for operating buses.The decision that incidentally comes on Labour Day, was taken following a meeting held Thursday by senior officials from the home ministry, including the secretary, with the railway board and officials from the Railway Protection Force (RPF), officials said. The home ministry issued an official order on Friday evening allowing movement of migrant workers, pilgrims, tourists, students and other persons, stranded at different places by the railway ministry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/railways-to-charge-for-ferrying-migrants-in-special-trains-amid-covid-19-lockdown/story-Mtwwss3sXlVsBhMfFXAghO.html

The government hasn’t clarified whether brick-and-mortar stores can also start selling phones as well as laptops in green zones.The sale of non-essential items through e-commerce platforms will only be allowed in those areas which have no or fewer cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), according to the MHA guidelines. So, they will be able to deliver non-essential items only in those areas that have been marked under orange and green zones. However, they have not been allowed to resume sales and delivery of non-essential items in the red zones until further notice.So if you are in Delhi and Mumbai and under a red zone, you won’t be able to order any non-essential items.The government had given a go-ahead to e-commerce platforms to resume full operations earlier as well. It had said it would ease the restrictions on e-commerce websites from April 20 but had revoked that order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lockdown-3-0-you-can-buy-smartphones-laptops-but-here-s-the-fine-print/story-MzE2wWATDjhlCGWNDsfLSK.html

02-05-2020||India||Amid Covid-19 lockdown, religious rituals, ceremonies take digital avatar||In the wake of the nationwide lockdown due to coronavirus, many religious places have gone online to stay connected with their devotes.Those who used to start their day with a visit to the temples are now performing online darshan to start their day. Most of the temples in Uttar Pradesh are webcasting artis, darshans and other rituals.“We’re under complete lockdown, but we’re trying to stay connected with devotees who keep on calling us for performing pujas inside the temples like before. We just tell them to wait for some more time. They can go online to our Facebook page where evening arti is webcast,” said Mahant Divya Giri, head priest of Mankameshwar temple.The devotees of the Golden Temple, a famous Sikh shrine in Punjab, who are not able to physically visit the holy site have turned to live streaming of kirtan on Facebook to stay connected with the age-old rituals that have been traditionally performed there.Keepers of the faith, including granthis (Sikh priests), ragis (traditional Gurbani singers) and sewadars (persons who render their services in performing rituals), begin their day as early as 2 am for the Amrit vela (the pre-dawn) ceremony that starts with the opening of the kiwars (doors of darshani deori). The rituals continue till 11.00 pm.Earlier, the kirtan was broadcast for a few hours in the morning and evening on a private channel which also used to share it on its Facebook page. Ever since the lockdown is imposed, the kirtan is telecast the whole day on a newly-created FB page, enabling the devotees to listen to the kirtan at home while being locked down.Chief secretary of the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC), Roop Singh, said, “Crores of devotees listen to kirtan through online live streaming across the world”. The SGPC, which manages the affairs of the shrine, has been providing non-stop audio live telecast of kirtan on its official website for many years.In Uttarakhand, after the portals of three of the Char Dham shrines opened amid the lockdown, priests said they would opt for digital worship/webcasting if required, especially in case the lockdown continues and pilgrims are unable to attend.The Char Dham yatra, which continues for six months, attracts lakhs of pilgrims and tourists to the state from across the world. Portals of the Gangotri and the Yamunotri shrines opened on April 26 while portals of the Kedarnath shrine opened on April 29. Portals of the Badrinath shrine will open on May 15.Deepak Semwal, secretary of the Gangotri Dham Committee said even without pilgrims, the rituals will continue as per the tradition.Semwal said, however, pilgrims will have the option of booking slots for online prayers in these difficult times when they cannot come for the pilgrimage to the Char Dham shrines. He said digital and online methods are some of the safest options these days.“If the pilgrims are not able to reach the shrines and want to offer prayers, then they can book slots online and see the ritual and prayers being offered here. We have facilities for digital worshipping and we will use them if needed. We will not be able to telecast rituals being performed in the sanctum sanctorum as photography or videography is not allowed but pilgrims can see other rituals,” said Semwal.In Himachal Pradesh, the Baba Balak Nath Temple, Deotsidh trust webcasts live arti twice a day. Temple official OP Lakhanpal said that the number of viewers varies and on an average, there are 2,000 to 3,000 attendees daily.  “Offerings and donations during the lockdown period were negligible. The month-long Chaitra fairs were also cancelled which will result in the downfall in the overall annual income,” he said.  At Chamunda temple in Kangra, Suman Dhiman said that earlier the temple trust had roped in a private firm for webcasting the arti which is performed twice a day. However, the same has now been stopped as the cost was high. However, a TV channel webcasts the arti daily on its own. In the south Indian states of Kerala, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, no live streaming of any rituals in important temples like Guruvayur, Sabarimala and Sree Padmanabha Swami temples is being carried out.Even when there was Chandanotsavam, an important religious ritual at the famous Simhachalam temple in Visakhapatnam on April 27, no webcast was done. It was attended only by few priests and the trust board chairman.Rituals are quite different in south and north India. In the south, only priests are allowed to the inner precincts of the sanctum sanctorum.Not only temples but Islamic Centre of India Darul Uloom Farangi Mahal is also live streaming evening Taraweeh (prayer). Head of Islamic Centre of India Darul Uloom Farangii Mahal Maulana Khalid Rasheed Farangi Mahali said, “Yes we started webcasting the namaz on our Facebook page because It is not right for people to congregate at one place. It’s for the first time we are not allowing any gatherings at the Idgah mosque, that’s why we decided to webcast evening prayers.”Meanwhile, churches in Uttar Pradesh are also organizing Sunday Mass on Facebook pages. “Technology is a blessing from God and we are using it to reach out to our church members. Even during Good Friday, the sermons were delivered in the absence of any gathering,” said Father Donald De Souza, parish priest St Joseph Cathedral Church, Hazratganj.The webcast of rituals and practices has also led to a fall in the revenue of the religious places like the Golden Temple in Amritsar. From an average collection of offerings of Rs 23 lakh a day (Rs 85 crore for the year, including those received online) in 2019-20, its collection during the curfew has dipped to between Rs 10,000-15,000 a day, said an SGPC official who did not want to be quoted. The Golden Temple sees an average daily footfall of 1 lakh devotees which has now dipped to around 1,000 a day, with devotees mostly coming in from areas near the shrine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-covid-19-lockdown-religious-rituals-ceremonies-take-digital-avatar/story-U9awtF1OwYUTcKDwBfOxRL.html

02-05-2020||India||Supreme Court yet to frame post-lockdown plans, decide on summer break||India’s apex court, the Supreme Court of India hasn’t put in place an exit plan for return to normalcy as the government relaxes lockdown restrictions, prompting comparisons with the Delhi High Court, which has created a committee to come up with a plan on this and also asked all district, sessions, and family courts to do so in anticipation of a flurry of filings post-lockdown.The Delhi High Court has also passed a resolution to work through June , when it is supposed to be on summer break. The apex court hasn’t said anything on this count. The Supreme Court suspended its regular functioning on March 23 and began hearing cases through video conferencing a day before Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the national lockdown in view of the coronavirus pandemic. Since then, the court has functioned in a limited manner hearing only those cases which it deems extremely urgent.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here Up until April 24, the top court sat for hearing on 17 working days with a total of 34 benches hearing cases through video conferencing. It heard a total of 593 cases and delivered 41 judgments. These numbers are far less when compared to the SC’s functioning in normal times when at least 500 to 700 cases are heard on a single day. On a typical day, 10 benches or more hear cases, with exception of Constitutional benches.Senior advocate and President, Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA), Dushyant Dave said doors of justice cannot be shut and steps should be taken to ensure normal functioning. “We have virtually shut down our judicial system. Even countries like England are facing serious challenges but haven’t shut their judiciary.”Dave added while physical hearing might not be possible, the court should invest in functioning virtually and all its benches should sit on all days to ensure more cases are heard through video conferencing. “The Supreme Court should work fully through video conferencing. All sixteen courts should sit on all days and list as many cases as they can. It would not be difficult to list before each bench at least 25 to 30 cases for admission and five cases for final hearing daily,” Dave said.Senior counsel Rebecca John echoed this sentiment. “The Supreme Court is (currently) sitting like a vacation bench. It should work all days of the week like trial courts and Delhi High Court. There should be more benches hearing the matter. The endeavour should be to increase number of cases that can be heard,”John said. “The Delhi High Court keeps sending out fresh notifications and instructions to trial courts and lawyers almost every day. That kind of conversation is not happening in the Supreme Court,” she added.Dave also pointed out that thousands of cases are piled up in the apex court for admission. “I would request the chief justice and colleagues in SC to increase number of cases for hearing, increase the number of hours of the hearings. They may consider working on Saturdays,” Dave said.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage However, senior advocate and former additional solicitor general Maninder Singh felt there is no pressing need for the apex court to revert to normal functioning. “I have not come across public pressing for opening courts. I have not seen any news on print or electronic media about people saying their case is not being heard. This is also because all industrial and economic activity has come to a standstill and crime rates have also reduced”, he said.Attorney General KK Venugopal too defended the SC and said it reverting to normal functioning through physical hearings during Covid may not be desirable. But if it does, and an open hearing is necessary, abundant precaution should be taken, he said. “Open court hearing in a regulated manner is a solution. There could be an annex room with screens for live streaming from each court room,” the AG suggested. This will help curb the crowding in Supreme Court’s corridors and inside courts, he added. “But this would require co-operation from lawyers. There should also be 12 to 13 screens streaming proceedings.”He added he hasn’t faced any issues with the current video conferencing facility but Dave said technological improvements are necessary and suggested SC explore private softwares. “Proceedings at Supreme Court are open. There is nothing wrong in using technology including Zoom, etc.,”, Dave suggested.He also did not hide his disappointment over the fact the apex court has not announced any decision yet on whether it will cancel its summer break. “The executive committee of SCBA had passed resolutions twice and requested the chief justice to scrap the summer vacation but I don’t know what is holding them back. I am personally deeply disappointed they have not cancelled summer break,” said Dave.Maninder Singh disagreed pointing out the top court takes vacation during the summer for around 6 to 7 weeks every year and addition of another 4 to 5 weeks to this year won’t make a difference.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-yet-to-frame-post-lockdown-plans-decide-on-summer-break/story-I5i3CExIXNnYaE0RY0Q7nJ.html
02-05-2020||India||Assam: Upset with governor’s rule in BTC, BPF looks for alternatives||Assam Governor Jagdish Mukhi’s decision to place the Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC) under his rule this week has riled the Bodoland People’s Front (BPF) - an alliance partner of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the state.Mukhi had placed the BTC, which covers four districts collectively called the Bodoland Territorial Area Districts (BTAD), under governor’s rule on Monday after the state election commission expressed inability to hold polls there due to the ongoing Covid-19 lockdown. BTC’s tenure expired on April 27.In a series of tweets on Thursday, former BTC chief and president of BPF, Hagrama Mohilary, opposed the decision to impose governor’s rule in the BTC and informed that his party has filed a petition in the Gauhati High Court against Mukhi’s order.“Due to the Covid-19, the elections of the BTC have been postponed. In this time of emergency, people here need our government more.” Mohilary tweeted.“But instead of extending the term, the Honourable Governor has given the charge of the BTAD to the Principal Secretary of Assam. We strongly oppose this decision and filed a petition in Gauhati High Court against this order,” he added.The BPF was in power in the BTC since 2003 when the BTAD was formed. Former rebel turned politician Mohilary was the chief of the BTC for the past 17 years. The party is part of the BJP-led ruling coalition in Assam of which Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) is also a part.“Though we are in an alliance with the BJP in the state, we are forced to reconsider our understanding. We are looking at other alternatives. I request Prime Minister Narendra Modi, BJP president JP Nadda and Home Minister Amit Shah to look into the matter,” Mohilary said in another tweet.Elections to the BTC council were due on April 4, but the state election commission deferred it indefinitely on March 20 because of the Covid-19 crisis.With the lockdown continuing, the state election commission informed Mukhi about its ability to conduct polls to the BTC general council while adhering to social distancing and other restrictions because of Covid-19.The Governor appointed Rajesh Prasad, IAS, principal secretary to the Assam government as the administrator of the BTC areas.“The Governor decided to bring the BTC under his rule as per provisions of the 6th Schedule of the Constitution. It is for the BPF to decide whether they want to continue in the ruling alliance or take some other measures,” said a senior BJP state office-bearer requesting anonymity.Even if the BPF pulls out of the ruling alliance, it won’t threaten the government. The BPF has 12 MLAs in the 126-member assembly while the BJP-AGP coalition has 74-well over the half-way mark of 64. Elections to the Assam assembly is due in April next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-upset-with-governor-s-rule-in-btc-bpf-looks-for-alternatives/story-2AzsJgcEMBF5K1KjtHJOtI.html

02-05-2020||India||Major relaxation for industries, no FIR against owners for Covid-19 cases: State govt officials||Industries would get a major fillip from May 4 with most state governments deciding to do away with the condition that an industry owner will be booked if a worker tests positive for Covid-19 and permitting to transport goods, said officials in multiple states.According to government estimates, not more than 5% of the industries started operations after April 20, when they were allowed to operate for the first time since the lockdown started on March 24.Factory owners cited tough Covid-19 conditions for not opening factories. The two conditions of concern for them were booking of factory owners for Covid-19 cases in their factories and mandatory in-situ boarding facilities for workers. Some factory owners have also complained of trucks carrying good being stopped on highways by the police.On Thursday, the Union home ministry issued a guideline exempting permits for all transport vehicles, which factory owners see as a major relief from harassment on roads. As per the guideline, police cannot check these vehicles during the lockdown.State government officials said on Friday the new industry guidelines to be issued in the next two days would see major relaxation in the norms for green and orange zones.“In green and orange zones, the industries would be almost back to normal,” said a government official. The officials, however, said industries could be allowed in red zones with tough conditions but not in the containment zones. Uttar Pradesh’s industrial development minister, Satish Mahana, said industry owners have been told that no first information report (FIR) will be lodged against them in case an employee tests positive for coronavirus. “We have also proposed to some more relaxations for the industry,” Mahana said.A Rajasthan government official said they have told industry owners to scan workers and no punitive action will be taken against them, if a worker tests positive. “We have told factory owners to maintain an everyday health record of workers,” the official, who was not willing to be named, said.A government official in Maharashtra said they have assured industry owners that they will not need any permission from the district collectors to operate, including for vehicles to bring workers and transportation of goods. Only 5% of total industries creating employment for 130,000 workers have started operations. The state’s principal secretary (industries) Venugopal Reddy said, “The government is trying to maximise the re-opening of industries and reduce the hurdles. The spread in Mumbai Metropolitan Region and Pune Metropolitan Region has been very high which has caused major problems in the industrial sector.” Just 1.5% of the 252,000 industries resumed operations in Punjab, the most industrialised state in northern India.“As there are issues related to supply chain, demand and working capital due to the nationwide lockdown, it is not as though everyone is getting back to work,” Vini Mahajan, additional chief secretary (ACS), industries and commerce, said.She said since this is a calibrated sort of opening up, one of the issues flagged by the industry owner is that cottage and tiny units located in urban areas should also be allowed to resume.In Himachal Pradesh, where the industries are mostly on the borders of Punjab and Haryana, factory owners want the government to allow inter-state travel of workers.“This is just shifting of the virtual borders and solve the dual purpose of making manpower available to the industry as well as containing the spread of Covid-19 in Himachal,” Shailesh Pathak, chairperson of Confederation of Indian Industry’s Himachal Pradesh chapter, said.“The state government would take all necessary steps for smooth movement of workforce besides strengthening the supply chain of raw material and furnished goods from the industries,” said chief minister Jairam Thakur.Pankaj Kumar, national president, Indian Industries Association, said if the government is able to address major concerns of the industry then from coming Monday (May 4) onwards there would be a resumption of some industrial activity.“Most states have withdrawn the FIR clause in the guideline. But the availability of workers, who are not returning, will remain,” said he said.The industry owners are seeking no penalty for delay in completing the projects, waiving fixed energy charges and minimum charges for lockdown period and relaxation in norms for paying provident fund and other benefits to workers.However, many states such as West Bengal, Bihar and Odisha are waiting for the central government guidelines to give a fillip to factories to resume operations.“We are waiting for detailed guidelines from the Union government on relaxations after May 3,” an official of the West Bengal government, who was not willing to be named, said. Once that happens, he said, the state will give more relaxation to industries. Only about half of 5452 applications in the state has got permission to run factories and only 25 of the 100 major jute mills have been allowed to run with 15% of workers.

Educational institutions; all social, political, cultural and other kinds of gatherings; hospitality services; and religious places or places of worship for public will also remain shut across the country, a central government order said and added that movement of persons by air, rail and road would be allowed for select purposes as permitted by MHA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-welcomes-lockdown-extension-to-review-relaxations-notified-by-mha/story-0zC0XHkMqLogHBYpeL8aBP.html
02-05-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||How much time have you lost because of Covid-19? Your company, if you work in one? Your business, if you own one?How much time has the economy lost on account of Covid-19? The country?Hint: the answer to none of these questions is 54 days.That — 54 days — is, of course, the duration of the lockdown till May 17 (it was supposed to end on May 3 but the home ministry on Friday extended the lockdown by two more weeks, although the expanded range of activities allowed in this period suggests that this is more a gradual and graded exit from the lockdown rather than a hard extension). The ministry of health’s latest zoning document — the country is divided into red, orange and green zones — shows that around a third of the country’s population (according to the last census) lives in the so-called red zones, the most affected by the pandemic -- and even in these, there has been a significant relaxation of lockdown restrictions. An analysis by Hindustan Times shows that 14 of the country’s 15 most densely-populated districts, including all of Delhi, parts of Mumbai, and Chennai, Kolkata, Hyderabad, and Chandigarh are in the red zone.Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageSome of the smart people I have spoken to — one of the benefits of being a journalist is that you have access to a lot of smart people, without being smart yourself — say the question on lost time can’t be answered now simply because there is as yet, no cure for Covid-19, no vaccine, and no telling how much worse things could get. The general consensus is that if the doubling rate — the number of days it takes for the number of infections to double; this is currently at 11.5 days in India — stays the same, and the central government as well as the state governments, and local administrations follow the home ministry’s guidelines and allow what is allowed (without making a fuss about it), then, things should start returning to normal by the end of May, perhaps June. Except, everyone admits, it will be a new normal.The infection will flare up, from time to time, and, hopefully, in specific areas, necessitating their containment but people will get used to the new normal of wearing masks, perhaps even gloves, social distancing, restricted travel, working from home, and the almost ritualistic cleansing that has to follow any excursion.Most people also said they’d like to think that India has dodged the bullet — that things won’t get as bad here as they did in Italy, the US, and the UK — but that they are not sure.So, assuming that this is indeed the scenario that plays out, let us return to the question about time.For even businesses that will bounce back almost immediately after the crisis — essentials and consumables, for instance — this financial year, 2020-21, will effectively be only nine months long.For many others, it will be even shorter. And the expectation, even among IT services companies, which get most of their revenue from servicing businesses in other parts of the world is that however long the year is, it will also be a very bad year.In temporal terms, that means that a company can consider itself fortunate if it ends 2021-22 (next financial year) where it would have ended 2019-20 (the last financial year), provided the last month had not been locked out because of Covid-19.In simple terms, that means a loss of two years.Personal finances, for those who have investment portfolios, could take just as long to recover, maybe longer, except for survivalists who invest in gold and nothing else.But this is at the level of large businesses and the salaried working class, although many of the former will now focus sharply on reducing costs and at least some of the latter will lose their jobs.Many small businesses will go under, years of hard work wiped out by one Black Swan event. And many people who stopped being poor — India’s big achievement in the years between 2006 and 2016 was to lift 271 million people out of poverty, according to a United Nations report — will slip back into poverty. We have no idea how many yet.An April working paper by the United Nations spoke of poverty “levels similar to those recorded 30 years ago” in some countries, and the possibility of the overall number of poor people in the world increasing by 420-580 million.It will be a new world post-Covid||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-KoHo9RDPIiZ95A3tbCagMK.html
02-05-2020||India||Lockdown dog days for CISF’s canine squad||It’s a dog’s life for members of the Central Industrial Security Force’s (CISF) dog squad. They no longer get to go out in groups, or play with each other; their workout sessions are now restricted to their kennels; and their diets have become fat-free . On the flip side, they get to play fetch, and also spend more time with their humans. Officers who handle these dogs said that instead of their routine workout, the dogs play fetch with a ball, in their kennel area itself, and practice their mandatory tactical training. Because they don’t report to work due to the lockdown, and are kept away from each other to ensure social distancing, their handlers are now spending more time with them so they do not get irritated or depressed. .CISF secures airports, important government buildings, monuments and Delhi Metro in the Capital. The force’s unit in Shastri Park, which looks after the security of the Metro has a total of 62 dogs. These canine commandos are experts at sniffing out explosives, weapons, drugs and can even pin down a person if the situation demands. A majority of these are German Shepherds, Cocker Spaniels and Labradors.“Earlier, all the dogs were taken out together every morning and evening to our parade ground within the Shastri Park unit premises for hours of exercise, tactical training on sniffing (out) explosives and for obedience training. But because of the social distancing norms, we now only bring one or two dogs at a time. Their movement is also restricted so we make them run within the premises, which is a vast open area with individual kennels built all around, facing the ground” said a CISF officer who asked not to be named.Following their exercise sessions, the dogs get into training, sniffing out explosives and weapons. Senior commandant, CISF, Jitender Rana said because the dogs are away from work these days, as both Delhi Metro and the airport are shut, they might forget their training. And with the dogs no longer invlved in rigorous physical work, their diet has been accordingly changed. “We avoid fat in their diet these days. Mutton, as its supply is also hit, has been stopped. To match their protein requirements, we have increased portions of eggs and milk in their diet. Chicken is served on some days,” said another officer who supervises the dog squad.But to ensure that social distancing , and playing or exercising alone, doesn’t affect any of these dogs mentally, their handlers are now spending more time with them. “Our men wear masks, wash their hands and apply sanitisers before entering the kennel. They groom these dogs, give them a bath, feed them and spend time talking to and walking with them. In a way, our handlers are getting more time to bond with their dogs and at the same time the dogs, who are less active on the field, are also getting to interact with us in such isolated times,” the second officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lockdown-dog-days-for-cisf-s-canine-squad/story-UF7cj259TEWNPVHd3g4PUN.html
02-05-2020||India||States finalise plans; buses, trains to take stranded home||State governments were on Friday putting in place protocols and guidelines to receive millions of migrant workers who were likely to take trains back to their hometowns after the Centre allowed their movement in a controlled manner amid the Covid-19 outbreak.The Union home ministry allowed on Friday interstate movement of labourers, students, pilgrims and others stuck across the country by special trains, widening the scope of a previous order that said such transportation can happen only by buses.Following demands of the state governments to run special trains, the Indian Railways said it decided to run ‘Shramik Special’ trains to move stranded migrants. The railways said the Shramik Special trains were meant for “nominated people” identified by state governments.The first train from Lingampally in Andhra Pradesh was expected to reach Jharkhand’s Hatia station late on Friday after it departed from its origin station earlier in the day. The other special trains to run on Friday were from Aluva in Kerala to Bhubaneswar, Nasik to Lucknow, Nasik to Bhopal, Jaipur to Patna and Kota to Hatia. These trains were scheduled to run non-stop and cover the distance to the destinations in 12 to 24 hours.According to the railway ministry, it is the responsibility of the state governments to arrange transport for stranded people to reach railway stations. Similarly, at the destination station, the local administration will have to arrange for medical check-ups of passengers and their onward travel.On arrival at Hatia, where the first train was expected to reach late on Friday, the passengers were to be first scanned for body temperature and then taken in sanitised buses to their villages, where they will be quarantined at home or government schools and primary health care centers.“On their arrival in respective districts, all of them would go through medical screening. Depending on their condition, they will be put in home quarantine or institutional quarantine accordingly,” a state government official said on condition of anonymity. He added that all passengers will be served packed dinner at Chakradharpur station after entering Jharkhand.Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren welcomed the Centre’s decision to allow trains to ferry workers and said that such a decision should have been taken earlier. “At this point, I will say better late than never. We should look forward rather than fight over the past,” he said.Bihar’s minster of building construction department, Ashok Kumar Chowdhary, said on Friday that the Centre heeded the demand of the state government. “We thank the government of India for heeding our request and a strategy is being finalised to give shape to their (migrants) return,” he said.The minister maintained that the state was fully prepared to take care of migrants, close to 250,000, who were willing to come back. The state government appointed principal secretary, Pratyaya Amrit, as the nodal officer to facilitate the return of migrant workers.Kerala, from where a special train was to leave late on Friday from Aluva in Ernakulam district to Odisha, has asked district collectors to prepare a list of priority workers. There are around 360,000 stranded migrants in Kerala, mainly from Wet Bengal, Assam and Odisha. The railways could be looking at running five special trains from Kerala every day. A government spokesperson said the workers have been told not to leave the camps to prevent overcrowding at the stations.Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel on Friday requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi to run special trains to bring back workers of Chhattisgarh stranded in other states. “In the present situation, point-to-point special trains could be run to ensure safety, convenience and hygiene of these workers,” the CM said, adding that the state’s request for special trains was pending with the home ministry.Uttar Pradesh, which was the first state to bring back stranded students from Kota and then workers from Haryana in government buses, has earmarked special quarantine centres near major railway station for workers coming back.“Nothing new is being done. We have already set up quarantine centres in major cities for stranded workers who are being brought back in buses. More, if required, will be created,” said a UP government official who asked not to be named. He said buses have been arranged to take the passengers to their villages.Maharashtra, where about half a million workers from other states are housed at 4,600 shelters, has started allowing workers to go back and has appointed nodal officers to facilitate their travel. “We have no information about the places from where the special trains will run,” said a state government official, who was not willing to be named. “The number of Maharashtrians stuck in other states is too little compared to the people from other states in Maharashtra. We have started taking the requests in stipulated formats from the migrants stuck in Maharashtra. District collectors in rural areas and police commissioners in urban areas will issue the passes,” said IA Kundan, secretary, Maharashtra government.The first special train to take back students was to leave Kota on Friday night, taking around 1,000 coaching students to Jharkhand. Till now, 27,000 students of 11 states and four Union territories have been taken back by their respective states in the past month, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-finalise-plans-buses-trains-to-take-stranded-home/story-sTwcSGUZJZQQVmxkHeNRfJ.html
02-05-2020||India||Eleven empowered groups reshuffled||The Narendra Modi government on Friday reshuffled the eleven empowered groups set up to control the Covid-19 outbreak in the country. The decision comes after the recent mega reshuffle of bureaucrats. While some groups will be headed by new secretaries, at least two have been pruned, indicating a shift in focus as the Centre extended the lockdown for the second time.The secretary of the department of economic affairs, Tarun Bajaj, will lead the group on economy and welfare affairs, replacing his predecessor, Atanu Chakraborty, who retired. New rural development secretary NN Sinha has also been made a part of the group. Amit Khare, the new I&B secretary, will lead the panel on information communication and public awareness. He was earlier heading the panel on public grievances and suggestions, which has been pruned. It will now be headed by administrative reforms and public grievances secretary K Shivaji. The panel earlier had three officials from the Prime Minister’s Office, and now there will be just two PMO representatives. The terms and references of the panels remain the same.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/eleven-empowered-groups-reshuffled/story-meZ7B0ydBhD1mAtxSwX4FP.html

A retired soldier in Rajkot lodged a criminal case against Bhushan on April 12 over his tweet on March 28 which said: “As crores starve and walk hundreds of miles home due to the lockdown, our heartless ministers celebrate consuming and feeding the opium of Ramayana & Mahabharata to the people.” He was referring to a Union minister’s tweet that he was enjoying Ramayana and Mahabharata since the lockdown was imposed.A bench of justices Ashok Bhushan and Sanjiv Khanna was critical of Prashant Bhushan’s comment. “Anybody can watch anything on TV. How can you say people cannot watch this or that?” It ordered the Gujarat police against any coercive action till the next date of hearing. It listed the matter after two weeks.Prashant Bhushan said he was replying to minister Prakash Javadekar’s tweet that he was watching Ramayana. He said he borrowed the word “opium” from the “oft quoted expression of Karl Marx that religion is the opium of the masses”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-grants-prashant-bhushan-relief-from-arrest-for-ramayana-post/story-mg6Pvk5XUuZ47XIjZXYWaO.html
02-05-2020||India||Govt rushing Central Vista project: Cong||The Congress on Friday accused the government of fast-tracking the ~20,000 crore Central Vista Redevelopment Project in New Delhi to avoid the Supreme Court’s scrutiny while urging it to scrap the ambitious plan or keep it last on its priority list given the Covid-19 crisis.“At this stage, when the future in terms of economic recovery and activity looks bleak, the government should have shown magnanimity and guts to announce scrapping of this project,” Congress spokesman Abhishek Manu Singhvi said. Singhvi urged the Supreme Court to give precedence to petitions against the project.The Supreme Court on Thursday declined to stay the project for the time being, saying there is no pressing urgency for granting one because the country is in a state of lockdown to check the spread of Covid-19. The redevelopment plan includes a Parliament building, and a common secretariat for central government offices. Congress president Sonia Gandhi last month wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi urging him to suspend the project and utilise the money allocated for it for constructing new hospital infrastructure along with equipping frontline workers with personal protection equipment and better facilities.Singhvi called the project somebody’s hobby horse. “It is not only for a Modi Mahal, which includes a new prime minister’s house, it is the intention to leave somehow in a personal manner, your own stamp by littering the whole of green verdant landscape of Rajpath with new buildings in name of convenience and modernisation. A more horrible attack on the heart and psyche of Delhi cannot be imagined.”He said when the nation is fighting the coronavirus, it is quite astonishing that the government is holding meetings on the project. “It just shows the warped, distorted, completely absurd priorities of this government. Bang in the middle of coronavirus crisis, they are fast-tracking, hot-footing this project,” Singhvi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-rushing-central-vista-project-cong/story-QtcccOAqzq1DcAqYtOBtuJ.html
02-05-2020||India||EC to decide on RS polls, Bihar next week||The Election Commission (EC) will next week decide whether elections can be held to fill 17 vacant seats in the Bihar Legislative Council and 18 in Rajya Sabha (RS). The number of voters likely to participate in the election will in Bihar be a major consideration while deciding the poll schedule, said an official aware of the matter.The 17 seats in Bihar include eight under the teachers’ and the graduates’ constituencies for which over four lakh voters have registered so far. In view of the Covid-19 pandemic that has prompted a national lockdown, the EC last month announced an indefinite deferment of polls.The 18 vacant Rajya Sabha seats are: Four each in Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh, three each in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, two in Jharkhand and one each in Manipur and Meghalaya. Gujarat and Rajasthan wrote to the EC asking it to postpone polls. An EC official said discussions were underway andeach state will be assessed first. “In the case of Maharashtra, the state government states that it will ensure elections will be held as per the stated health protocols.”On the Rajya Sabha elections, Samajwadi Party MP Javed Ali Khan said the decision is the EC’s prerogative. “The situation in Maharashtra was unique. There was a constitutional requirement for the CM [chief minister] to get elected [before he completes six months in office]. But there is no such compulsion to fill the RS seats,” he said. In Bihar, a state government official said the EC will be apprised about the challenges that will be faced in ensuring social distancing and sanitation protocol for the polls. “We are looking at a large voter participation. Polling stations for these eight seats will be set up at every block across districts and it will not be easy to ensure proper distancing and health protocols.”Bihar’s opposition Rashtriya Janata Dal lawmaker Manoj Jha said holding the election to the legislative council is different from assembly elections. “There has to be a universal policy for all.” he said. In UP, 11 legislative council seats are vacant and an official said there has been no discussion on when elections will be held for them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ec-to-decide-on-rs-polls-bihar-next-week/story-AxOGCk84Cwi3F44egtCVwM.html
02-05-2020||India||Patna with 44 Covid-19 cases among Bihar’s 5 districts in red zone||Patna figures among Bihar’s five districts under the red zone, finishing hopes of an early end to restrictions imposed due to coronavirus.A 54-year-old man from Motihari, infected by Covid-19, and suffering from cancer of the oesophagus died at the Nalanda Medical College Hospital in the state capital on Friday in what was the third fatality in the state due to the fast spreading contagion.Munger with 95 cases, Rohtas (52), Buxar (51) and Gaya (6) are the other districts, along with Patna (44), in the red zone, as per the zone-wise classification of districts pan India, released by the health ministry on Thursday for focussed management of Covid-19. Twenty other districts of Bihar are under the orange zone and the remaining 13 in green zone. This classification will come into effect from May 4 and will last for around a week after which it will be revised. Bihar accounted for 3.84% of the total 130 districts under the red zone in India. Similarly, the state contributed 7.04% of the total 284 districts under orange zone and 4.07% of the remaining 319 districts under green zone in the country.“The classification is multi-factorial and takes into consideration incidence of cases, doubling rate, extent of testing and surveillance feedback to classify the districts. Based on field feedback and additional analysis at state level, states may designate additional red or orange zones as appropriate. However, states may not relax the zonal classification of districts classified as red/orange as communicated by the ministry,” said Preeti Sudan, secretary, ministry of health and family welfare, in her letter to chief secretaries of states and union territories.It is a dynamic list and would be revised on a weekly basis or even earlier, she said.“A district will be considered under green zone, if there are no confirmed cases so far or there is no reported case since the last 21 days in the district,” said her letter of April 30.Bihar’s cases are now doubling in less than six days as against nine days previously. The number of cases had gone up from 43 to 85 between April 8 and 17. The same went up from 85 on April 17 to 170 on April 23, as per information shared through a tweet by Sanjay Kumar, Bihar’s principal secretary, health, on April 24.Four days later, the cases had doubled, crossing the 340-mark.The state health department has not shared any more information on Covid-19 case doubling in number of days. It has not shared information on zone-wise classification of districts ever since the first Covid-19 case was reported in Bihar on March 22.Efforts to reach Kumar proved futile as he did not respond to phone calls or text messages. Bihar health minister Mangal Pandey was also not available for comments despite repeated attempts.Bihar’s 466 cases are spread across 30 of its 38 districts, with Munger topping the list at 95. It was followed by Rohtas (52), Buxar (51), Patna (44), Nalanda (36), Siwan (30), Kaimur (24), Gopalganj, Madhubani (18 each), Bhojpur (12), Begusarai (11), Aurangabad (8), Gaya, Sitamarhi, Saran (6 each), Bhagalpur, Darbhanga, East Champaran, West Champaran, Madhubani (5 each), Lakhisarai, Nawada, Arwal, Jehanabad (4 each), Banka, Vaishali (3 each), Madhepura, Katihar (2 each), Purnia, Araria Sheikhpura (1 each).According to government data, Bihar had reported 282 Covid-19 cases during the last one week between April 23 and 30.The total number of active Covid-19 cases is 365, after three deaths in the state capital and 98 patients having recovered and discharged from different government facilities in the state so far.ZONE WISE CLASSIFICATION:RED ZONE: Munger, Rohtas, Buxar, Patna, GayaORANGE ZONE: Nalanda, Kaimur (Bhabua), Siwan, Gopalganj, Bhojpur, Begusarai, Aurangabad, Madhubani, East Champaran, Bhagalpur, Arwal, Saran, Nawada, Lakhisarai, Banka, Vaishali, Darbhanga, Jehanabad, Madhepura, PurniaGREEN ZONE: Sheikhpura, Araria, Jamui, Katihar, Khagaria, Kishanganj, Muzaffarpur, West Champaran, Saharsa, Samastipur, Sheohar, Sitamarhi, Supaul.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/patna-with-44-covid-19-cases-among-bihar-s-5-districts-in-red-zone/story-am1klfLSOzdrNrxWZC2ZZK.html
02-05-2020||India||Bengal’s controversial Covid-19 death audit committee virtually shelved||In a significant development, the West Bengal government has decided to virtually shelve the expert committee of doctors auditing deaths among patients testing positive for the novel coronavirus infection. The committee had triggered a great deal of controversy, with the state’s opposition parties alleging that the committee had been formed to suppress the number of deaths.“The committee will continue doing academic and research work. Death declaration will no longer require its vetting. It will be declared as per protocols set by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR),” a top official of the state health department said on Friday.New Delhi-based ICMR is the nodal body for Covid-19 treatment and procedures in India. The state government will henceforth declare Covid-19 deaths as per the death certificates, which will mention the immediate cause of death, antecedent cause of death and underlying cause of death. The Covid-19 death audit committee, comprising doctors, was set up on April 3 by chief minister Mamata Banerjee, who also holds the health portfolio. As of April 30, the committee assessed deaths of 105 patients who had tested positive for Covid-19 and attributed 33 deaths to the coronavirus infection and another 72 deaths to ‘severe co-morbid conditions’.“The committee examined all the relevant documents, including bed-head tickets, treatment history, laboratory investigation reports, death certificates and other documents sent by the hospitals concerned to determine whether Covid-19 or pre-morbid conditions were the immediate cause of death,” according to a government document dated April 24, and signed by Bishwa Ranjan Satpati, who heads the expert committee.This very role of differentiating between deaths of patients on the basis of pre-existing ailments had triggered a massive political controversy. Even an inter-ministerial central team, in its letter to the state on April 22, had asked the state to clarify the basis on which such a decision to differentiate between deaths had been taken.However, the state government’s change of stance on the role of the committee seems to have happened after leaders of different doctors’ associations raised the issue during their meeting with the chief minister on April 28.“We had told the chief minister that such differentiation was necessary for academic purposes only and the debates around identifying the immediate cause of death should remain confined within the boundaries of academic institutions. We are very grateful to the government for listening to the suggestion of the doctors. We expect the government would henceforth list deaths of all Covid-19 patients as Covid-19 deaths,” Rezaul Karim, a leader of West Bengal Doctors’ Forum who attended the meeting with the chief minister said.Explaining the new role of the committee, chief secretary Rajiva Sinha said, “All death cases will no longer be referred to the committee. They will pick up random cases, fetch details from hospitals, and then give recommendations to the state.”A top health official said the state was likely to consider only those deaths as Covid-19 deaths in which the death certificate would mention Covid-19 as the immediate cause of death. Meanwhile, Bharatiya Janata Party state unit president Dilip Ghosh filed an online petition before the Calcutta high court on Thursday evening, seeking the court’s intervention in ensuring clarity on Covid-19 death figures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-s-controversial-covid-19-death-audit-committee-virtually-shelved/story-0zH3IsFWycP8zY29rZHVcI.html
02-05-2020||India||I&B ministry may ease norms for live broadcasts by non-news channels||The Information and Broadcasting ministry is planning to simplify the norms related to live broadcasts for general entertainment TV channels that may now have to only register online than seek prior permission.The ministry on Thursday released its draft policy guidelines for uplinking and downlinking TV channels.According to the new guidelines, general entertainment channels will also be able to carry live broadcasts by registering at the Broadcast Sewa online portal of the ministry.“The idea is to simplify the process. Earlier, non-news TV channels had to seek prior permission of the ministry to make live broadcasts. These included religious and sports channels,” a senior official said.However, the aim is to make the functioning of these channels easier under the government’s ease of doing business drive, the official added. Therefore we have only kept the requirement of registering in the portal for holding live telecasts, the official said.Among other things, the new draft guidelines also propose no increase in annual permission fees. The ministry had released uplinking and downlinking guidelines in 2011. It has sought responses from stakeholders on the draft suggestions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/i-b-ministry-may-ease-norms-for-live-broadcasts-by-non-news-channels/story-uIBc34YV4CUbFtXbKOUc3M.html
02-05-2020||India||Expect three days of heavy rain, hailstorms from tomorrow: IMD||Delhi and all of northwestern India can expect thundershowers, hailstorms, lightning, and gusty winds (30-40 kmph) over three days starting the evening of May 3, courtesy the first western disturbance of the month, according to the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) forecast. IMD has issued an orange alert for most parts of northwest India between May 3 and 6. The warning is for Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and parts of Rajasthan, where thunderstorms, dust storms and gusty winds are expected due to the fresh and intense western disturbance, according to the Regional Weather Forecasting Centre, Delhi.There were seven western disturbances -- cyclonic condictions originating in the Mediterranean -- in April that brought rain and thundershowers to different parts of the country and kept temperatures lower than normal.“The approaching western disturbance will be intense because an area of low pressure will form and on the night of May 3, a cyclonic circulation is likely to develop over west Rajasthan; there will be moisture incursion from the Arabian Sea. The disturbance will bring rain, thunderstorms, squally winds of 40 to 50 kmph speed over the entire north western region for three, four days. There may be snowfall in the upper reaches of Western Himalayas,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, Regional Weather Forecasting Centre, Delhi.Meanwhile, this season’s first cyclonic storm, Amphan is developing over the south Andaman sea. On Friday, a low-pressure area formed over south Andaman Sea and adjoining south-east Bay of Bengal. Its intensification is expected to be slow and delayed, IMD said in its Friday bulletin. “Accordingly, it is likely to become more marked over the same region during next 48 hours, concentrate into a depression over Andaman Sea and adjoining south-east Bay of Bengal during subsequent 48 hours and intensify further thereafter.” The depression or storm is likely to move north-northwestwards gradually till May 5. Under its influence, there is likely to be heavy rain and thunderstorms over south Andaman Sea and adjoining south-east Bay of Bengal and Andaman and Nicobar Islands over the next five days.Sea condition will be very rough over south Andaman Sea and south-east Bay of Bengal from May 1 to 5, according to the bulletin, which has advised fishermen not to venture into south-east Bay of Bengal on May 1, south Andaman Sea and south--east Bay of Bengal on May 2 and 3, and Andaman Sea and adjoining south-east Bay of Bengal on May 4 and 5.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/expect-three-days-of-heavy-rain-hailstorms-from-tomorrow-imd/story-CrEaTW5A9hokxjANSm2vwN.html
02-05-2020||India||Key hurdles cleared for new Parliament building, Oppn fumes||The plan to build a new parliament building has received two key approvals, including from the environment ministry’s expert appraisal committee, taking a crucial but controversial government project a step closer to reality.The opposition Congress said the decision reflected the government’s “absurd priorities” at a time when the country was battling an epidemic, and independent experts who were meant to be part of one of the clearances that were issued late last month said the decision was taken despite their requests to delay deliberations.In addition to the approval by the EAC, which assesses a project on whether its environmental impact is acceptable, the proposal for the new building was cleared by the Central Vista committee. Both approvals came around the same time -- towards the end of April. The second committee has representatives from the government and developers, as well as independent experts who protested the decision saying they sought a deferment because of the restrictions on movement due to the lockdown in force to check the spread of the coronavirus disease.“They went ahead without any external member in attendance. It includes two members from the Institute of Town Planners (ITP) and two from Indian Institute of Architects (IIA). Only government officials were there, this is clearly a conflict of interest. Even the Supreme Court on Thursday said ‘there is no hurry to hear the matter on Central Vista’ then what was the urgency in holding this meeting despite our requests to postpone it? We had several concerns, we had informed adequate arrangements should be made for us to attend but we got a notice on April 21 that the meeting will be held,” said Balbir Verma, member IIA.The Central Vista committee, in the minutes of its meeting held on April 23, explained its decision to go ahead with the deliberations. “…Keeping in view the importance of the project in nation’s interest and time scale for its implementation, the meeting was held as per issued meeting notice”.In meetings held between April 22 and 24, the other government committee – the EAC -- cleared the proposal with certain conditions, among them being the outcome of the legal challenge filed with courts as well as the requisite scrutiny by the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC), according to the minutes published on the environment ministry’s Parivesh website.The new parliament building is a part of the Centre’s larger plan to give a makeover to the Central Vista, the 3-km stretch between the Rashtrapati Bhavan and the India Gate that is flanked by government offices built decades ago. The parliament building itself will cost an estimated cost of Rs 922 crores. The project has been criticised by urban planners and civil society groups for spending hundreds of crores on renovating a heritage structure in the midst of an economic slowdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Activists have also criticised the manner in which the Central Vista renovation is being cleared: it has been split up into smaller projects that makes it easier to obtain requisite environmental approvals, they said. SC is hearing two petitions filed by citizens against the way public hearing was conducted to facilitate the project and challenging the legal validity of the land use change process. The land use of the 9.5-acre plot has been changed from “recreational” to “Parliament” by the Delhi Development Authority in March.One of the petitioners moved the Delhi high court on Friday. The matter has been adjourned.The EAC minutes addresses concerns raised by activists such as LokPATH and other residents groups by answering each concern. For example, civil society groups said the parliament is structurally a part of the composite notified heritage precinct, the Central Vista. “The application completely disregards the historical, cultural and social importance of the existing Parliament by treating its “expansion and renovation” as any other regular construction project,” they said. To which, the EAC said: “The project proponents are aware of the heritage value of the Parliament Building. It is precisely because of the need to protect its heritage value, besides other practical aspects such as seating more members for the future and providing them with necessary infrastructure, that the project has been conceived.”Experts said it was a “fait accompli” situation where the land use changed and clearance has been recommended before the outcome of the SC case. “All the concerns of building-by-building approach to impact assessment of the Central Vista project remain. The cumulative impacts of the entire central vista redevelopment over a much larger area are very different from that of one new Parliament building. What gets even more questionable today is that a ₹922 crore new Parliament is approved when the country is dealing with a severe economic, humanitarian and environmental crisis,” said Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher at Centre for Policy Research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/key-hurdles-cleared-for-new-parliament-building-oppn-fumes/story-CJ7kWyhED8zjNcOVT28idJ.html
02-05-2020||India||Special trains ferry stranded migrants home||Amid demands by states and a recognition of the logistical challenges involved in transporting millions of people back to their home states, the Centre on Friday decided to allow special trains — called Shramik Specials — to enable stranded migrants to return home. States have welcomed the government’s decision. Five such trains operated on Friday. This is the first time any passenger rail services operated in the country since they were suspended on March 22, three days before the national lockdown. The railways will charge fares for tickets on these trains. It has, however, categorically clarified that these trains are only meant for individuals who are nominated and registered by state governments, and not for regular travel. In a new order that expands the scope of an earlier order which allowed the movement of migrants only in buses, the ministry of home affairs said, “The movement of migrant workers, pilgrims, students, tourists and other persons, stranded at different places, is also allowed by special trains to be operated by the ministry of railways.” The order said that the railway ministry would designate nodal officers for coordinating with states and Union territories, and issue guidelines for sale of tickets and social distancing norms to be observed. The government emphasised that this was being done on May 1, which is marked as the Labour Day. Millions of migrant workers have been struggling after the lockdown was announced, facing a shortage of food and income, and have been seeking to go back home hundreds of kilometres away, including by foot. The Centre came up with a protocol for road movement on Wednesday, after persistent demands by states and a looming humanitarian crisis. But when the scale of the movement was assessed — there were close to ten million migrants registered with state governments — states asked for special trains.On Thursday evening, officials from the home ministry, including the home secretary, met with the railway board and officials from the Railway Protection Force (RPF), which led to the order. Later in the day, the railway ministry said that trains would operate from point-to-point on the request of the concerned state governments. Senior officials would be appointed as nodal officers. It clarified, “The passengers have to be screened by the sending states and only those found asymptomatic will be allowed to travel.” It would also be the responsibility of the sending governments to bring such individuals to the designated stations in sanitised buses, following social distancing norms. All passengers will have to mandatorily wear masks; while meals and drinking water are to be provided, according to the ministry, by the sending government. The railways will charge passengers for the journey, which will include the price of regular sleeper class tickets, a superfast charge of ₹30 and an additional charge of ₹20. “This includes meals and drinking water for long distance trains. State governments will coordinate and can pay on passenger’s behalf, “ the ministry stated. It will also ensure social distancing norms in trains. Aout 1,000-1,200 passengers are expected to travel in each train. Each coach has a capacity of seating 72 passengers and only 54 passenger per coach will be allowed. In coupes, six passengers have been allowed instead of eight.The ministry statement also defined the role of the receiving governments. “On arrival at the destination, passengers will be received by the state government who would make all arrangements for their screening, quarantine if necessary and travel from the railway station.” State governments have put in place new protocols for medical check-up and quarantine for workers expected to return in the special trains. Trains operated between Lingampally in Telangana to Hatia in Jharkhand; Aluva in Kerala to Bhubaneswar; Nasik to Bhopal; Jaipur to Patna; and Kota in Rajasthan to Hatia on Friday. A train between Nasik and Lucknow got rescheduled in consultation with state governments, according to an official familiar with the development. The first train was the one between Telangana and Jharkhand, which had about 1,200 migrant workers on board. Passengers expressed happiness at the opportunity to return home, finally. Santosh Kumar Singh, 27, a worker from Jharkhand’s Daltongunj, said over phone that they were allowed in the train after proper screening. “We are being provided food on time and have faced no problem.”Amid apprehensions that the announcement of special trains could lead to crowding in stations, the railway ministry also reiterated these were special trains planned for nominated people identified and registered by state governments. “No one under any circumstance should come to railway stations looking for trains. We will not issue any tickets to any individual or entertain any request from any group or individual. We will allow only those passengers to board whom state government officials bring to the railway stations,” it clarified.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/special-trains-ferry-stranded-migrants-home/story-GwWtxnZz43RrAlYaH75eYN.html
02-05-2020||India||Covid-19 lockdown 3.0: Graded easing of curbs over 2 weeks||With India’s extended 40-day lockdown drawing to an end on Sunday, the Union government has decided to extend the lockdown for another two weeks. But this has been accompanied with a range of relaxations, in varying degrees, across India’s red, orange and green zones to gradually allow businesses and individuals to resume their normal life -- even while protecting the most vulnerable. In a detailed order on Friday evening, the ministry of home affairs issued guidelines for the range of activities which are to be permitted and prohibited in different administrative jurisdictions; reiterated that there would be a ban on regular air and rail travel and interstate transport; said educational institutions would remain closed, as would hospitality services and public places such as cinema halls and malls; and enhanced the scope of surveillance and treatment measures in containment zones. The guidelines also stipulated that individuals engaged in non-essential activity shall not move out between 7pm and 7am; and the elderly, those with co-morbidities, pregnant women and young children would stay home. It also had detailed instructions on the precautions to be taken in workplaces and public places, with an emphasis on social distancing and use of face masksThe government, however, did not announce any simultaneous economic and fiscal package to manage the costs of the lockdown and provide relief to businesses, as demanded by industry bodies, which have praised the calibrated opening of the economy but re-emphasised the need for an immediate stimulus.  Experts too argued that while the easing of restrictions was welcome, this should have been greater in scope and states should have been allowed more leeway in determining zones and activities. Industry bodies welcomed the easing of the restrictions, but reiterated their call for a support package. Chandrajit Banerjee, director general of the Confederation of Indian Industries, said that the government’s guidelines were well considered; the opening up of private officers will enable the resumption of service sector organisations; and permission to industrial activities is on the lines of what industry bodies had demanded. But Banerjee added that with restricted economic activities, the imperative for a quick and forceful economic support package for industry was even more compelling now. “CII has suggested instituting a government spending package equivalent to 3% of GDP which would add ₹6 lakh crore to the available firepower. Enhanced debt to GDP ratio can be a way out for adding fiscal space at a time when the debt to GDP ratio is modest in India.”The Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) said that the order will allow for a “calibrated opening up of the economy”. Sangita Reddy, FICCI’s president, said that a regular assessment is required of the zones and activities to further open up the economy. “It is also now an opportune time for the government to come up with a financial package, especially for the MSMEs and the industry as a whole.” The order comes five days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi had, in an interaction with chief ministers, asked for a detailed study of the impact of the lockdown and restrictions on red, orange and green zones — and said that life and economic activity in green zones will become a model. On Thursday, the health ministry did a fresh categorisation of these zones, which is subject to regular review. There are now 130 red zone districts, which according to a data analysis by Hindustan Times, are home to one-third of the country’s population and include major metros; 284 orange zones; and 319 green zones. The home ministry order first provides a detailed definition of these different jurisdictions. A district is considered a green zone if there is no case of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), or if no confirmed case has been reported in the last 21 days: red zones are categorised on the basis of total number of active cases, doubling rate of cases, extent of testing and surveillance feedback. All other districts are considered orange zones. While states and Union territories are allowed to upgrade a green zone to an orange zone, and orange to a red zone, they cannot downgrade the classification from red and orange to green zones. Containment zones shall be defined on the basis of mapping of cases and contacts, their geographical dispersion, areas with well demarcated perimeter and enforceability — and could range from a mohalla (neighbourhood) to a town in the case of urban areas, and from a village to a block in the case of rural areas.Health protocol will become more strict in these containment zones. According to the order, 100% residents in these zones should have the Aarogya Setu App. There will be also be continued contact tracing, home and institutional quarantine based on risk assessment; testing of all cases with severe acute respiratory infection, influenza like illness and other symptoms; house to house surveillance; no movement of individuals in and out of these zones except for medical emergencies and supply of essential goods and services; and recording of details of people moving in and out of the perimeter. The order then stipulates the range of activities that remain prohibited across the country. These include domestic and international air travel, all passenger movement by train, metro rail services, interstate movement of individuals, educational institutions, hospitality services, cinema halls, gyms, malls, entertainment parks, theatres, bars, and all social, political, and religious gatherings. All places of religious worship will remain closed. It also prohibits movement of individuals between 7pm and 7am for non-essential activities, restrictions on activities of those segments of the population considered more vulnerable to the infection. This will apply to all zones. According to the order, here is what is not allowed in red zones — taxis, cab aggregators, cycle and auto rickshaws, barber shops and salons. But there are also now a range of activities that are allowed in red zones, which is a departure from past norms, when activities were more severely curtailed. Now, individuals and vehicles can move for permitted activities (in a vehicle, two people can travel besides the driver). A range of industrial establishments in urban areas — special economic zones, export oriented units, industrial estates and townships with access control; manufacturing units of essential goods and IT hardware; among others — can operate, while all industries in rural areas can function. Construction activity is now allowed, as long as workers remain on site. All standalone shops, neighbourhood shops, and shops in residential complexes — without any distinction between the essential and non-essential — can also function. E-commerce will, however, be confined to essential goods. Private offices can also now function, up to 33% of their strength, while all government offices will function up to the level of 100% above the rank of deputy secretary and 33% below that in red zones. The order then defines the range of activities permitted in orange zones. While intra- and inter-district plying of bus transport will not be allowed, unlike the red zones, taxis and cab aggregators will be allowed to function here with one driver and two passengers. Inter-district transport in vehicles will also be allowed for permitted activities, with a maximum of two passengers and a driver in a four wheeler. All activities will be allowed in green zones. Buses, too, can operate here at 50% capacity. Experts believe that the government could have adopted a more nuanced approach and there should have been further easing of restrictions. Ramanan Laxminarayan, director of the Centre for Disease Dynamics, Economics and Policy, said that the added value of restrictions had been diminishing for some time. “As cases increase, it is important to allow people to seek care promptly and my concern is that a lockdown could hinder health care access. There are still a high number of districts which are in red and orange zones, the categorisation of which is are based on how far testing has reached. This is not a reliable measure.”Suyash Rai of Carnegie India said that while the relaxations were welcome, the approach was still too centralised, with the Union government essentially determining which districts fall under which zone and also deciding on the list of permitted activities. “Given the diversity among the states, it would have been better to decentralise such decisions, especially after six weeks of a nationwide lockdown. The Union government should have issued an advisory and left it to the states to decide.” Rai also pointed out that with most of the major commercial centres in the red zone, economic activity will continue to be substantially restricted. “We need to learn to get back to work while managing the risks around Covid-19. Government action needs to be supplemented by individual responsibility, community based prevention, and adaptation by firms and other establishments. Lockdown is not a sustainable response.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/graded-easing-of-curbs-over-2-weeks/story-ILnzlu9uYI6LbYlL8u2VNM.html
02-05-2020||India||Does concept of open offices make sense in a post-pandemic world?||It is a concept that has been around since the 1950s when it originated in Germany (although some put its year of origin even earlier); in the decades since, there has been enough research to show that its cons far exceed its pros; yet it has lingered on. It, of course, is the open office, and the coronavirus disease, Covid-19, may have finally killed it. As the coronavirus pandemic spread across the globe in February, most workplaces around the country (and the world) began to implement rules among employees to avoid clusters, maintain physical distance, wear masks, sanitise hands. and avoid biometric entry. Many put in place strict deep cleaning protocols. And finally, all suddenly discovered the merits of WFH (work from home). Once the lockdown is lifted and at least some employees look to rejoin work -- many will work from home; for instance, India’s largest software services firm Tata Consultancy Services has said that up to 75% of its global workforce will work from home by 2025 -- one of the most important questions facing organisations is simply this: Can the open office plan, marked by a lack of cubicles such that all employees are required to sit or work in clusters, still make sense in a world ravaged by the ongoing pandemic?The straightforward answer? NoThe open office was aimed at improving collaboration and proficiency among employees. By the turn of the century, and after a few decades of cubicles, the open office became the norm. Different types of furniture, which demarcated different spaces of work, was a distinct feature of the open office floor plan: hubs for private meetings, longer tables around which larger groups could gather for meetings or scribbles, single or two-seater sofas for more private conversations and glass-walled meeting rooms that also offered the same transparency that marked the rest of the office. Work desks became workstations where clusters of employees would be seated, often sharing resources such as lamps and telephones, and that great luxury of the modern workplace -- coffee machines. In a post-Covid-19 world, this translates into zero social distancing, not to mention multiple shared surfaces. In other words, heightened risk of transmission of Sars-Cov-2. Sorry, but that’s how everyone thinks now. “We are looking at a complete 180-degree shift [in offices]. The whole premise of how offices have been designed has been about collaboration and people coming together. Now the premise about people coming to office is about social distancing. So the whole focus will be on how to get people to interact in such a way. The communal spaces that the open office plan allowed for will not be possible anymore. It won’t be possible for three people to sit on a sofa and have a discussion,” said Aparna Piramal Raje, author and columnist on business and design.Neetish Sarda, founder of Smartworks, a firm that offers co-working spaces across nine cities in India, said that his company instituted workplace measures on March 20 itself, five days before the nationwide lockdown was announced. The measures, which included disinfecting all surfaces and floors, temperature checks using an infrared thermometer at entry points, placement of sanitizer bottles at “high touchpoints” and emphasis on hand wash/sanitization while entering office spaces,mandatory masks , sanitising packages, physical distancing , and preventing sharing of dishes or drinks and eatables, will also be enforced once the lockdown is lifted, he said.Will companies redesign the office space altogether? US-based furniture maker Steelcase recently released a report-cum-catalogue titled Navigating What’s Next: The post-Covid workspace has some thoughts on that. “Planning for now also means retrofitting the workplace, based on a common-sense approach that adheres to governmental and global health guidelines, including physical distancing, adding barriers, cleaning and safety measures,” it said. “Work environments in the future will require reinvention as science-based evidence and emerging technologies offer new solutions. Planning paradigms of the past were driven by density and cost. Going forward they need to be based on the ability to adapt easily to possible economic, climate and health disruptions,” the report added.Some of the more immediate suggestions it offers includes reconfiguring desks, or pulling them apart to reduce face-to-face orientation, which can be achieved for instance, by turning workstations through 90-degree angles which would prevent workers from working directly across or behind one another. It also suggests using open spaces for meetings of more than five people as well as leveraging flexible furniture with movable whiteboards and screens to create boundaries.Shields between people — such as those made of material like plexiglass or plastic — will make a comeback, Carol Bartz, former CEO of Yahoo! Inc., recently told a magazine. “I think people are going to want protection, plexiglass or whatever. There will also be more teleconferencing, absolutely less flying — you will teleconference with customers,” the longtime Silicon Valley chief executive told Marketwatch in an interview.Bimal Patel, director of Ahmedabad-based HCP Design, Planning and Management Private Limited — the architecture firm mandated to develop New Delhi’s Central Vista — said that it was too early to think of lasting design changes.“The most interesting thing that has emerged out of the present crisis is not so much this idea that we may need to make lasting [design] changes in the long run but that a lot of people, particularly in the service industries like our own, have discovered the potential of working online. We [at HCP] have discovered that there is quite a lot of stuff that we can manage to do (without coming into the office). [Of course,] when we do come, it will be because we need to sit around a table, and draw on the same drawing, or stand around a drawing and discuss it. There is work that we all need to do that will bring us close together.”In the short run, he said, the important thing for firms to figure out is how many people can actually stay away from the office so as to reduce the number of people coming in to work.Though Patel may not agree with this, his remark highlights a larger question -- forget open offices, do we even need offices? Around the world too, organisations are beginning to rethink work schedules of employees to stagger their return, and enable more people to work from home. Global commercial real estate services firm Cushman & Wakefield is testing a design concept called the Six Feet Office to help employees stay six feet apart. This includes signage that helps people recognise distance, usage of disposable desk covers, and ensuring that people walk only clockwise through the office space to minimize bumping into each other.A PricewaterhouseCoopers pulse survey among 305 US companies published on April 27, found that more than three-quarters (77%) were putting new safety measures in place, while others said they were taking steps to promote physical distancing, such as reconfiguring workspaces (65%). More than half the companies (52%) were planning on changing shifts and alternating crews to reduce exposure, while 49% of the companies said they were planning to make remote work a permanent option for roles that allow it. Indian furniture maker Godrej Interio has a four-person team, called the Ergonomics and Workspace Research Cell, whose mandate is to study issues commonly faced in offices — like noisy colleagues — and publish findings that eventually guide their product design team. When the global pandemic hit and offices around the globe and India began to close down, it began to study the challenges of working from home. “Our aim is to reach 10,000 [respondents] so the research is still ongoing. We asked questions like, what are the issues people face; how can we help them stay productive? Our focus is on the health and well-being of people,” said Sameer Joshi, an associate vice president in the marketing division of Godrej Interio who leads the team. Based on the findings, a “work from home” range of 40 furniture items will be rolled out once factories open, Joshi said.“We are getting a lot of interest from corporates to supply furniture for home. So we’re taking these learnings and quickly adapting [them] to reconfigure [existing] home furniture [models]. Indian homes are denser, there’s often no space for a separate office. Same piece of furniture is used by multiple users, unlike the office. The solution has to be flexible enough so that it adapts to different users,” Joshi said.At a time when the world stares at yet another economic recession, it is crucial to ask whether firms will make such additional investments in office spaces or infrastructure to enable people to work from home. Raje said it would be in their own interest to do so. “For the first time, many organisations will have to think of their employees being in a kind of life and death situation [inside the office]. In most industries, you don’t think about this, unless you’re in the manufacturing space or in the armed forces. So, if you view it from that perspective, then certain investments have to be made. [Of course] somebody has to bear that cost. Maybe that cost may come out of employee salaries,” she said.Or they may simply come out of the savings companies hope to make from rent payments.

02-05-2020||India||Centre to offer cheap grains to 3.9 million more people||The Centre will offer cheap grains to an additional 3.9 million people, who qualify for subsidized ration under the National Food Security Act 2013 but are out of the public distribution system due to inclusion errors, Union consumer affairs, food and public distribution minister Ram Vilas Paswan has said. Paswan said his ministry is on a mission to ensure no beneficiary is left behind and has asked all states to issue ration cards to those excluded and send the data so that foodgrains could be allotted to them. Bihar alone has 1.4 million such people, Paswan said.Once states send their lists, the beneficiaries would get additional ration under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana, a welfare package announced on March 26 to deal with the Covid-19 crisis.“We have asked states to send us the list. We are ready to meet all additional foodgrain requirements. We have enough stocks. Our aim is to ensure everybody has food,” Paswan said. Federally held food stocks currently stand at 56 million tonnes, while 6 million tonne are needed for the next three months, he added.Under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana, beneficiaries are being given double their current food entitlement free of cost for the next three months.Nearly 810 million qualify for subsidised foodgrains under the food security law, under which beneficiaries get 5kg of wheat or rice covers per person per month. The Act applies to 67% of the population (75% in rural areas and 50% in urban pockets). According to the minister, 3.9 million of these 810 million are still outside the ration system due inclusion and enumeration errors. “State governments have to give them ration cards so that we can release their ration,” he said.The Right to Food Campaign activists have said the government should universalize the country’s public distribution system. This implies that nobody is excluded, but the rich automatically exclude themselves.Paswan said food allocation to beneficiaries was in accordance with the National Food Security Act. A revision of the number of beneficiaries could be done only during the next Census slated for 2021, according to section 9 of the Act.The Covid-19 lockdown announced on March 24 pushed thousands of internal migrants, especially in cities, into a food crisis. During the initial phase of the lockdown, they were virtually outside the country’s public (grains) distribution network or PDS that offers that offers cheap grains. Many states have now set up community kitchens to serve them. Subsidized grains are only available to beneficiaries who have eligible ration cards. “Most migrants in cities either do not have them or have with their families back in their home states,” said Deepa Sinha, who teaches at Delhi’s Ambedkar University.Paswan has also approved the on-boarding of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh and Dadra & Nagar Haveli and Daman & Diu the “One Nation One Ration Card” plan. Twelve states are already on board an interstate cluster under the plan. These are Andhra Pradesh, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Jharkhand, Kerala, Karnataka Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Telangana and Tripura. Reviewing the progress of the implementation of national portability of ration card holders under the “One Nation One Ration Card” plan, Paswan monitored the technical readiness of these new states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-to-offer-cheap-grains-to-3-9-million-more-people/story-WRSyZxCh31WhnClRAZZg6H.html
02-05-2020||India||Will take years to transport migrants by buses: Congress||The Congress on Friday lashed out at the Centre’s plan to transport stranded migrant workers home by buses and said the “ill-conceived plan” will take many months to see through to its completion.Congress’s reaction came aday after the Union government released guidelines for transporting workers, students and others who are stuck away from their home states because of the lockdown imposed to prevent the spread of the coronavirus disease.The plan to transport them by bus is a “cruel joke,” the Congress said, adding that it doesn’t take into account the requirements of either states or the migrant workers.The party demanded that the Centre run special trains to take stranded people home and also provide a financial package to states to handle the crisis. Indian Railways has announced that it would run special trains to take migrant workers to their home states.Senior Congress leader Abhishek Singhvi said, “You have no idea of the stated facts and the number of migrant labourers, when you issued this Tughlaqi Farman on April 29.”Sighvi estimated that millions of migrant workers were stuck in different parts of the country. He said; “Any estimate of these figures means that you take up to two or three years to transport them by buses. How many buses, how much petrol, how much diesel, how many roads, how many road blocks, we don’t know and what is the rationale behind this, I am not able to understand; the country is not able to understand.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-take-years-to-transport-migrants-by-buses-cong/story-MnTLeNwpJcLK6zBBwxDtsJ.html
02-05-2020||India||Mobility to recreational and retail places drops by 86%||India saw an 86% drop in people visiting retail and recreational places, while those visiting parks, transit stations, and grocery and pharmacy units dropped by more than 50% each during the national lockdown imposed to slow the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), according to the latest community mobility data released by Google.Data from the report shows that the highest drop in people’s mobility among big states was seen in Delhi and Maharashtra, the two regions which saw the initial surge in Covid-19 cases. Maharashtra had close to 10,500 confirmed cases by Thursday night, the highest in India, while Delhi had more than 3,500 cases, the third highest count in the country.The community mobility reports by Google, which also show trends over several weeks, are a composite representation of the number and length of visits people make to certain kinds of places compared to a baseline --in this case, a five-week period before the infectious disease started spreading across the world. The data is collected from users who opt-in to location history for their Google account, without revealing their identity.Across India, visits to parks, transit stations, workplaces, and grocery and pharmacy units dropped by 68%, 66%, 41% and 51%, respectively. On the other hand, visits to residential places increased by 22% as people largely stayed home during the lockdown.To understand how mobility trends changed in different states, Hindustan Times ranked states and Union territories on their average drop in mobility to non-residential places. The states which saw the highest drop in overall mobility are Chandigarh (85%), Delhi (82%), Andaman and Nicobar Islands (71%) and Maharashtra (71%). The states which saw the lowest drop are Mizoram (34%), Arunachal Pradesh (39%), Bihar (41%) and Manipur (41%).Lakshadweep and Jammu and Kashmir have been excluded from this calculation. Data for all parameters was not given for Lakshadweep. In Jammu and Kashmir, internet services were not active throughout the year, which can produce erroneous results. This is visible in Google’s report as Jammu and Kashmir has shown a surge in visits to transit places and workplaces during the lockdown, which is contrary to the ground situation.To be sure, while this data helps understand the impact of the lockdown across different states, Google says this may not represent the exact behaviour of a wider population as this is based on data from only a limited number of users who opted in to location history for their Google account. Also, data for regions with different characteristics may not be accurately comparable (such as comparing a predominantly urban state with a rural one) because, Google says “location accuracy and the understanding of categorized places varies from region to region”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mobility-to-recreational-and-retail-places-drops-by-86/story-MuFjPEFBUGJrZdSNnUwYsJ.html
02-05-2020||India||Focus has been on containment, situation is constantly improving: MP CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan||Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has said his state is now on the right track in dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic even as his government has drawn flak for mismanaging the situation. In an (email/telephone) interview with Ranjan, Chouhan spoke about how he has faced the pandemic challenge from day one since taking office last month. Edited excerpts: Covid-19 was the challenge you faced after taking office. How is the situation a month later?..it is a challenging time not only for the state but for the whole country. Right from the moment when I was sworn in, my full focus has been on preventing the Covid-19 spread and safeguarding lives and making sure we have all the arrangements to combat the menace. The situation is constantly improving. A large number of infected patients have recovered and are recovering. We have distributed ayurvedic, herbal and yunani medicines among people to improve their immune system. Today, our medical system is much stronger against this infection. Tests are being conducted in 11 laboratories. We have also used IT at its optimum level...for monitoring the situation and running the state machinery and maintaining social distancing. ...the wheat procurement is going on in the state. You have blamed the previous Congress government for doing nothing in fighting Covid-19. What did you expect it to do?It could have taken preventive measures that we did as soon as taking over. There were fewer medical facilities. If the Congress government was aware of this impending crisis as its leaders claim, what did it do? Nothing. They were involved in their internal party conflicts instead of taking care of the state and its people.The Congress has alleged the Bharatiya Janata Party was focused on toppling its government and did not understand the situation... They are making such comments to hide their failure. Why did not the Congress government take early preventive measures? They are doing what they do best: blaming us and levelling false allegations. We have taken quick decisions... It is the timely implementation of the lockdown, which has helped in controlling the infections. This is not the right time to make political moves and hurl allegations. They [Congress] should contribute in fighting the pandemic.What went wrong in Indore and Bhopal that they have emerged as major hotspots and Madhya Pradesh as one of five worst-hit states by Covid-19?Initially, there were fewer cases primarily in Jabalpur. There was a rapid increase in the number of cases around major cities like Indore and Bhopal. Members of Tablighi Jamaat [who attended a congregation at the group’s Delhi headquarters that later emerged as a Covid-19 hotspot] came back... They are also the reason for this sudden rise as they responded reluctantly and did not come forward willingly and thus indirectly spread the virus. Indore is also a prime commercial centre and densely populated. A number of people from Indore travel abroad. Initially such people hid their travel histories and somehow came into contact with others and this resulted in spreading the infection. Over 100 employees of the health department have also got infected. Has the responsibility been fixed and action taken in this regard?We are fighting a terrible epidemic. Our officers, health workers and administrative personnel have been at the forefront of fighting this war. They were ready like warriors in the service for the public risking their lives. Unfortunately, they got infected. However, taking cognisance of the infection among them, I have asked for a detailed report. Without knowing the facts, it would not be right to say what went wrong. Their contact history is being investigated and we are trying to find out about the cause of their infection.What is your response to a central team’s visit to Indore and its suggestions?The team has appreciated Madhya Pradesh for its efforts. The death toll has been brought under control and special care is being given to Indore. The team has suggested some measures based on their nationwide experience. Its guidance will definitely help.What is your strategy to contain the disease and are there special plans for boosting economic activities?I have instructed authorities that there should be effective implementation of the strategy to identify, isolate, test and treat. The strategy is simple and involves following lockdown guidelines and social distancing. It involves staying at home, staying safe and no entry, no exit from containment zones. It is a question of life and death. Safety and security of the common man is our top priority. As soon as the situation comes under control, the lockdown will be lifted and normal life will be back on the track.We have to let small economic activities across the green zones. We have also allowed small businesses to run but with safety measures. Many industries are operating from April 20. All protective measures should be followed at workplaces.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/focus-has-been-on-containment-situation-is-constantly-improving-mp-cm-shivraj-singh-chouhan/story-q7eqiTgkYGAU8TxnOeLn7N.html
02-05-2020||India||Gujarat: 22 new deaths raise toll to 236; plans afoot to return migrants||Twenty-two people died of Covid-19 and 326 more cases were reported in Gujarat on Friday, as the government of chief minister Vijay Rupani came to grips with the task of sending home migrant workers stranded in the state.The new deaths and cases took to 236 the number of fatalities claimed by the coronavirus disease and 4,721 the number to have tested positive for Covid-19 in Gujarat to date. Ahmedabad, the principal city of Gujarat, bore the brunt, reporting 267 new cases. Jayanti Ravi, principal secretary (health), said 26 new cases were reported from Surat, 19 from Vadodara and the remaining from other districts. On Friday, the worst five affected districts of were Ahmedabad (3293 total cases), Surat (640), Vadodra (308), Rajkot (58) and Bhavnagar (47).“The health staff in Gujarat is on their toes 24x7 to cure Covid-19 patients, especially those with co-morbid conditions. In such a scenario, the health experts are provided online guidance to treat crucially ill patients. Around 24 children, three pregnant women and 68 senior citizens who were critically ill due to Covid-19 have availed of the benefits of tele mentoring program and recovered successfully,” Ravi said.With 49 positive cases reported from Gandhinagar and 21 from Botad, chief minister Rupani appointed two senior civil servants to supervise measures being taken for curbing the transmission of the virus in the two districts and guide their administrations.Rajeevkumar Gupta, additional chief secretary (forest and environment), and Sanjeev Kumar, managing director, Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation, have been appointed to oversee Gandhinagar and Botad, respectively, said a government statement.Ashwani Kumar, secretary to the CM, said the process of sending back stranded labourers from other states had started with launch of a helpline number --- 1070. “The stranded people are required to file an online application on Digital Gujarat Portal,” he said.“The CM has made it clear that only asymptomatic people will be allowed to enter the state. All those with cough, fever, cold and other such symptoms will not be permitted to enter Gujarat. Similarly, all those who are completely healthy will be allowed to return to their home state from Gujarat,” Kumar said.He added that all the migrants wishing to return home from Gujarat will undergo a medical examination and those who are healthy will be provided a certificate to that effect. The CM directed district collectors to use primary and community health centres for conducting the medical examinations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gujarat-22-new-deaths-raise-toll-to-236-plans-afoot-to-return-migrants/story-O10VXvJps59NEbFQ2i2RyJ.html
02-05-2020||India||After curbs are lifted, air journeys in India may become quicker||When flying starts post lockdown, flying times may come down significantly with passenger airlines set to get access to defence airspace. Senior aviation officials have confirmed to Hindustan Times that Prime Minister Narendra Modi at a meeting with Department of Military affairs allowed the use of this hitherto segregated airspace.”This is a reform suggestion that has been pending for several years,’’ said the senior official. “It means that you can fly in straight lines instead of avoiding defence areas. It will significantly bring down costs.’’To be sure, it still doesn’t mean the airlines will be allowed to fly over strategically important defence assets and areas. Due to social distancing norms necessitated by the Covid-19 pandemic, planes will not be allowed to fly to full capacity. The access to defence airspace will help bring down fuel costs. A statement from the Prime Minister’s office said: “The Indian Air Space should be effectively used in such a manner that the flying time is reduced, benefitting the travelling public and also helping airlines save costs in close co-operation with the Department of Military Affairs.’’A spokesperson for air carrier GoAir said: Overall, this initiative will benefit the industry, with less flying time for the passengers, and also enable better emissions. However, the exact benefits can be known only after the routes are published.””Usually, there are height restrictions over defence areas and populated areas. But if they agree, then that means that civil airlines will be able to use their airspace too,’’ said Air Vice Marshal Manmohan Bahadur, Addl Director General, Centre for Air Power studies.``It could make substantial difference. For instance, If you go from Delhi to Chennai, you would avoid ammunition depots like Jabalpur. With this decision, you don’t have to do that anymore,’’ said Group Captain VP Singh. That means a shorter flying time. While this will help ailines cut costs, what will help even more, a pilot said on the condition of anonymity, would be to reduce the tax on aviation turbine fuel.At the meeting, the Prime Minister also cleared the handing over of six more airports on a public private partnership basis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-curbs-are-lifted-air-journeys-in-india-may-become-quicker/story-oCoZkt339qPiPh4CJj90QO.html
02-05-2020||India||Lit up warships, fly-pasts to honour Covid-19 warriors||India’s chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat on Friday said that the armed forces will show their gratitude to the country’s Covid-19 warriors on May 3 by performing a raft of activities including fly-pasts, flashing warship lights, and displays by Indian Army bands.Briefing reporters at South Block in the presence of the three service chiefs, Rawat said military helicopters will shower petals over hospitals dedicated to treat coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patients and the armed forces will lay wreath at the police memorial to show support for Covid-19 warriors, including doctors, nurses and police personnel, who have been at the forefront of the battle against the outbreak.Rawat said the Indian Air Force’s fighter jets and transport planes will carry out fly-pasts across the length and breadth of the country, from Srinagar to Thiruvananthapuram and Dibrugarh to Kutch. The United States is also carrying out fly-pasts over several of its cities as a tribute to people leading the fight against the pandemic that has killed at least 235,000 people across the world.Rawat said the show of gratitude will involve switching on Indian warships’ lights near the shores and mounted band performances outside Covid-19 hospitals in every district of the country.General Rawat acknowledged the contribution of health care workers, policemen, home guards personnel, sanitation workers, delivery boys and the media amid the outbreak of the highly contagious disease.He said: “We also cannot forget the people of the nation who have adhered to government guidelines on social distancing, wearing masks, ensuring proper hygiene… And when the government gave a call for ringing bells or lighting [candles and lamps], our nation stood together.” Rawat added that the country demonstrated the resilience to overcome the public health crisis.The military’s plan to honour front-line workers on May 3 was finalised at a meeting chaired by defence minister Rajnath Singh on Friday, a government official said. The meeting was attended by the national security adviser, the CDS and the three service chiefs.The armed forces are working on a war footing to handle the pandemic -- setting up dedicated hospitals, flying medical supplies, operating quarantine facilities and playing a key role in evacuating Indian nationals from other countries.Indian Navy chief Admiral Karambir Singh said the government has asked the navy to stay ready to evacuate Indian nationals from Gulf countries. He said warships were ready to carry out the evacuation and will swing into action after getting the go-ahead.As reported by Hindustan Times on April 29, the navy has kept three warships on standby to bring back thousands of Indian nationals stuck in the Gulf countries as New Delhi works towards implementing a challenging evacuation plan that will also include special flights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lit-up-warships-fly-pasts-to-honour-covid-19-warriors/story-CUPYVxcSqaGChBySLT9yCL.html

02-05-2020||India||Medical supplies’ production scaled up, domestic manufacturers in focus||The central government has scaled up production of medical equipment in response to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak and ordered 60,884 ventilators, of which 59,884 will be manufactured in India, an official said on Friday as he detailed the country’s preparedness to tackle the infectious disease.The Centre has projected a demand of about 75,000 ventilators till June to manage critically ill Covid-19 cases in the country, said PD Vaghela, secretary, department of pharmaceuticals. He is the chairman of one of the empowered groups formed to control the outbreak in the country.Presenting the government’s projections and procurement plans at the 4pm news briefing, Vaghela said the Centre has ordered 22.2 million personal protection equipment (PPE) kits, of which about 14.2 million will be procured from domestic manufacturers and the rest imported.Currently, 19,398 ventilators are available, and orders for 60,884 have been placed. About 1,000 of them will be imported.“The HLL Lifecare Limited, a PSU under the ministry of health and family welfare, is acting as the central procurement agency. Most of the orders are being placed domestically and the government has worked hard to encourage domestic manufacturers to start producing, including the raw material as even raw material is in short supply globally. About 15,000 ventilators are already manufactured and testing is currently being done,” Vaghela said.Considering the increased global demand and shortage of essential medical supplies, the government is promoting domestic manufacturing and is resorting to imports only if necessary.The total projected demand of PPE kits till June has been estimated to be 20.1 million. Against the same, orders for 22.2 million kits have already been placed.From importing about 50,000 PPE kits annually to putting in place a system to domestically manufacture about 200,000 kits in a day, India has ramped up its capacity to deliver on the need for medical equipment in the past two months, officials said.“Earlier, we didn’t manufacture PPE kits or N-95 masks in India. All these supplies were imported, and there was not much demand for it also. In just about a month, we have identified from two manufacturers to the current 111 manufacturers domestically. In just about 15 days, we established nine labs that could do the quality testing of kits,” said Vaghela.The total projected demand for N-95 masks till June has been estimated to be 27.2 million. Against the same, orders for 24.9 million have already been placed. Of these, 14.9 million orders have been placed with domestic manufacturers and about 10 million N-95 masks are being imported.There are four major domestic manufacturers in the country and more are in line, which have been identified and facilitated. The daily domestic production was about 230,000 on April 30, according to the official.The production of oxygen is also being ramped up. “In India, we don’t need too many ventilators; what is required is adequate supply of oxygen as most of the severely ill patients need oxygen support,” he added.The total manufacturing capacity of oxygen is 6,400 metric tonne, of which around 1,000 mt is used for medical oxygen. There are five big and 600 small manufacturers of oxygen, and about 409 hospitals have their own oxygen generation units.About 438,000 medical oxygen cylinders are available for supply, and orders for 103,000 new medical oxygen cylinders have been placed. 500,000 industrial oxygen cylinders have also been identified for conversion, if required. Orders for the conversion of 60,000 cylinders have already been issued.“It doesn’t take much in converting industrial oxygen to medical oxygen; if required we also have that option open,” said Vaghela.The government is also keeping a close watch on the drugs supply to tackle shortages, if any. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) production has increased from 122.3 million to 300 million tablets per month. The country has released about 160 million tablets of HCQ to the Centre as well as state hospitals, and pharmacies against the requirement of about 25 million.“We are managing well, and like we exported HCQ, we should be able to export other supplies also in the future after obviously meeting our own demands,” said Vaghela.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/medical-supplies-production-scaled-up-domestic-manufacturers-in-focus/story-mtmxaTCnYEBP6YtXbe05TM.html
02-05-2020||India||130 districts identified as Covid-19 hotspots home to nearly 400 million||The Centre on Friday listed 130 districts as hot spots of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), down from the previously designated 170 “red zones”, even as the number of “green zones” – areas that largely remain outside the spectre of the pathogen – decreased from 353 to 319, an announcement that came hours before the national lockdown was extended by two weeks, but with some relaxations.The Union health ministry removed 92 districts from the 170 it classified as Covid-19 hotspots on April 15 and added 52 new districts to the list, leaving 130 red zones in the total 733 districts in the country. These 130 districts are home to a third of the country’s population and cover a fifth of the geographical area, an analysis of the 2011 Census data by Hindustan Times shows. Nearly 400 million people live in these hot spots, which are spread across 22 states and Union territories (UTs), but only four states are home to more than half of them.In the fresh classification, which will be followed by states and Union territories for a week from May 3, 284 districts have been identified as orange zones, up from 207 districts. All major metropolitan cities such as Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Ahmedabad have been designated as red zones because of high caseloads and clusters of infections.Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageThe zones were initially divided on the basis of total cumulative cases and the rate of doubling of cases: red zones were those where the numbers of Covid-19 infections and doubling rate were high; orange zones had fewer cases and greater doubling rate; and green zones were those where no case was reported in 28 days. The new list, however, was prepared by including other factors such as incidence and level of testing, and population density.“This time, we have broadened the criteria. The areas have been labelled also keeping in mind the fact these should not become potential hot spots if relaxations are given as per the green zone criteria. Some places may be in green zone but their proximity to areas where case load is high makes them vulnerable, so those areas have also been designated as red or orange zones in the new list,” said Lav Agarwal, joint secretary, health ministry.Red zones will now be defined by taking into account the total number of active cases, the doubling rate of infections, the extent of testing and the surveillance feedback. To qualify as a green zone, an area would have had to report no new infections for three weeks. The classifications will be “dynamic” and updated at least weekly as conditions change, according to a letter by Union health secretary Preeti Sudan.There are significant differences between the list of red zones shared on April 15 and the latest advisory. Even as the total number of red zone districts has decreased by 40, seven states have seen a rise in the number. West Bengal saw the highest rise, from four to 10. Tamil Nadu saw the biggest fall in the number of such districts – out of the 22 districts earlier classified as red zones, 13 have now been removed while three new districts have been added to the list, making the new tally 12.  The 400 million people in the 130 red zones live in more than 83 million households across nearly 2,500 towns and 120,000 villages. These comprise a third of all towns and a fifth of all inhabited villages in the country, according to the Census data.To be sure, this is a close approximation for present times because the population figures would have changed since the Census was last conducted, and some district boundaries have also changed since then.Among all states and UTs, Delhi is the only one fully classified as a red zone, other than Chandigarh which is a single district Union territory. After Delhi, West Bengal has the highest share of districts in red zones – 10 out of the total 23 districts, or 43%. Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh follow with nearly 39% districts being red zones. In terms of absolute numbers, Uttar Pradesh has the highest number of red zone districts – 19 out of 75 – followed by 14 districts in Maharashtra (out of 36 districts) and 12 districts of Tamil Nadu (out of 37 districts).Faridabad, Gautam Buddha Nagar and Meerut have been classified as red zones, while Gurugram and Ghaziabad are designated as orange zones.The 14 most densely populated districts in India, according to the 2011 Census, have been classified as red zones. These include eight districts of Delhi, two districts of Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Hyderabad and Chandigarh, all big urban clusters. Out of the 50 districts that have the highest population density, 25 have been classified as red zones.Although the red zones are spread across large geographical areas, cutting across state boundaries, more than half of the people living in these red zones are in just four states – Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh. Put together, 215 million people live in red zones in these four states, which is 54% of the total 400 million people in the red zones in India.Also, there are no red zone districts in 14 states and UTs. These include 10 states – Goa, Himachal Pradesh and all eight states of the northeast – and four Union territories – Puducherry, Lakshadweep, Ladakh and Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu.The revised list of Covid-19 hot spots was released ahead of the Centre’s announcement of the extension of the national lockdown to break the chain of infections. While the red and orange zones will continue to have intensified contact tracing, doorstep surveillance and restrictions on movement, other areas will see considerable relaxations.Sudan’s letter to states and UTs read: “It is further highlighted that based on field feedback and additional analysis at state level, states may designate additional red or orange zones as appropriate. However, states may not relax the zonal classification of districts classified as red/orange as communicated by the ministry.”“It is important to ensure that we identify pockets of critical interventions for a focused management of Covid-19 at the field level,” Sudan added.Infectious disease experts say that lockdown has helped and now is the time to consolidate the gains. “It is useful if we are to utilise the time gained in identifying infected individuals isolating them, tracing contacts and quarantining them to interrupt the chain of transmission. We should be able to identify cluster transmission as people are confined to homes. Mathematical models have shown how extended periods of lockdown can decrease the peak. But if infected individuals are not identified and contained, then as soon as the lockdown is lifted, there would be a spurt of cases,” said Dr Lalit Kant, infectious disease specialist and former head of the Indian Council of Medical Research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/130-districts-identified-as-covid-hot-spots-home-to-nearly-400mn/story-mBc30ah41ddAAKoa9fAfiK.html
02-05-2020||India||Counter terror ops in J-K increase in lockdown||The nationwide lockdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic did not affect counter-insurgency operations in Jammu & Kashmir. The operations were rather intensified and resulted in the killing of the highest number of terrorists belonging to different Pakistan-based outfits in April. In fact, April has been the most successful month for security forces in the last year, according to official data.Out of 60 terrorists killed so far this year, 46% (28) were in April. The last time the Jammu and Kashmir police, army and the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) eliminated so many terrorists in a month was in May 2019 (28).Eighteen terrorists were killed in January while seven each in February and March. While 20 belonged to Hizbul Mujahideen, eight were from Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), six from Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), three from Islamic State in Jammu and Kashmir (ISJK) while 20 were unidentified. Some of those killed were top commanders – Jahangir Wani (HM), Sajjad Nawab Dar (JeM) and Muzzafar Ahmed Bhat (LeT). Most of them were traced to Pulwama (16) and Shopian (12) and killed in gunbattles.An official involved in counter-insurgency operations, who did not wish to be named, said, “Pakistan-based terrorists have tried to take advantage of India’s national lockdown to foment trouble in the Valley. In fact, there were reports in 36-37 days, since lockdown was announced, that terrorists have come out of their bunkers, from inside the jungles as they were asked to intensify attacks against security forces.”Zulfiqar Hassan, special director-general, CRPF (Jammu & Kashmir), said, “Terrorists have tried to take advantage of the lockdown but intelligence-based counter-terror operations are continuing in full swing and there is great synergy among all the forces.”Last year, 152 terrorists were killed in Jammu & Kashmir, with 11 in April, according to official figures.In 2018, the security forces killed 215 terrorists including 22 in April. The maximum number of terrorists killed in a month-- 39-- was in November 2018.Pakistan has also resorted to continuous ceasefire violation in March and April to help terrorists sneak into Jammu & Kashmir. It has been trying its best to fuel terrorist activities while the world is focused on fighting the pandemic, army officials said.Pakistan has violated the ceasefire around 1,400 times this year. This number was 3,168 in 2019 and 1,629 in 2018.Defence minister Rajnath Singh last week asked India’s top military commanders to ensure the country’s adversary is not allowed to exploit the Covid-19 situation.The army has been dealing with an increase in infiltration attempts by Pakistan-backed terrorists looking to stir trouble since the Centre’s move to revoke Jammu & Kashmir’s special status in August last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/counterterror-ops-increase-in-valley-in-april/story-urVSEknFJAft37twr2oX4O.html

02-05-2020||India||In video conversation with Rahul, Rajan suggests Rs 65k-crore aid for poor||Former Reserve Bank of India governor Raghuram Rajan has suggested that the government transfer cash directly to the poor and supply food through the public distribution system (PDS) to as many people as possible to help them tide over the impact of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak and the consequent 40-day lockdown,estimating the effort will cost Rs.,65,000 crore.The money is small given that India’s gross domestic product is to the tune of about Rs 200 lakh crore, Rajan said in a video conversation with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on how to deal with the crisis caused by the disease.Copies of the video were released to the media by the opposition party. Rajan’s suggestions do not go far enough to address the need to revive and reboot the economy, which has been battered by the public health crisis, economists and industry representatives said. Industry bodies have called for a Rs.16 lakh stimulus package. “We need to find ways of getting both money as well as food through PDS to as many of these people as we can,” said Rajan, whose sint as RBI governor between September 4,2013 and September 4,2016, was spread across the terms in power of both the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance and the Bharatitya Janata Party (BJP)-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) Rajan said the poor must get food, and if they don’t have ration cards entitling them to subsidized grains,a temporary solution should be put in place. “Most immediately, keep people well and alive. Food is extremely important. Places where the public distribution system doesn’t go. (Economists) Amartya Sen, Abhijeet Banerjee and I have talked about temporary ration cards,” the former RBI chief told Gandhi in the first of the video conversations the latter plans to hold with public intellectuals.Rajan has effectively endorsed the NDA government’s response to the pandemic in the form of the Rs 1.7 lakh crore welfare package unveiled in March, two officials at economic ministries said. The package, announced by finance minister Nirmala Sitharman, provided food items such as rice, wheat and pulses; three free cooking gas cylinders till June this year and direct cash transfers to the accounts of the poor.“Although Dr Rajan did not mention whether the Rs 65,000 crore should be over and above Rs 1.7 lakh crore already announced on March 26, it is assumed that he must be aware about the package. The package was an initial response and more funds will be released to protect lives and livelihood of the poor,” one of the officials said, requesting anonymity.Spokesperson of the two economic ministries declined to comment on the conversation between Gandhi and Rajan. Ram Singh, a professor at the Delhi School of Economics ,said Rajan’s suggestions seemed to be aimed at the 130 million extremely poor households of India.“If Rs 5,000 direct cash is transferred to each family, it will come to around Rs 65,000 crore. This seems to be the maths. It will certainly help. But it is not enough to stimulate the economy as a whole.”The PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry wants the government to provide a stimulus package of Rs 16 lakh crore, around 7% of GDP, sooner than later to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on the economy “through various relief measures and benefits,” said DK Aggarwal, president of the industry association.Such a package will help the economy grow around 5% in the current financial year and rejuvenate businesses , he said. India’s economic growth had already been slowing because of a decline in private investment and household consumption when Covid-19 hit. The International Monetary Fund has estimated India’s economic growth at 1.9% in the current fiscal year, the slowest pace in three decades.Rajan said India should be lifting the lockdown, which is due to end on May 3, and open up its economy in a “measured way;” a prolonged lockdown can lead to social distress, he warned. “We have to be cleverer about opening up...We need to open up in a measured way but as fast as possible so that people start having jobs. We don’t have the capacity to support people across the spectrum for too long,” he said.“It is all too easy to have a lockdown forever, but obviously that is unsustainable for the economy,” he said.India is has been in lockdown since March 25, confining residents indoors, shutting industrial production, halting flights and passenger railway services and taking public transport off the roads in an attempt to enforce social distancing and break the chain of infections.“I don’t think we have to aim for 100% success and have zero cases when we open up... What we have to do is to manage the reopening so that when there are cases, we isolate them,” said Rajan, according to whom aggressive testing should be at the core of efforts for the management of Covid19 .Rajan evaded a direct response to a question from Gandhi on “centralisation of power” and the “authoritarian way of governance” in India.“I do believe that decentralisation is important both for bringing more local information to work but also about giving empowerment to the people. What you see across the world is a great sense of disempowerment. Decisions are being made elsewhere, but not by me (was the feeling among the people),” he said.Taking a swipe at Gandhi, BJP national spokesperson Sambit Patra tweeted, “RahulG complains to Raghuram Rajan of an ‘Authoritarian Model’ But of course those who had put in place an ‘Accidental Model’ for them any other model that has ‘Decisiveness’ & ‘Determination’ as it’s basic ingredients will be passed off as ‘authoritarian’!!”In the conversation with Gandhi, Rajan stressed the need for social harmony, saying India cannot afford to be a house divided in challenging times. “Social harmony is a public good. Having everyone believe that they are a part of this system, an equal part of the system is essential,” he said.Rajan was cautious when Gandhi asked him if India could take advantage of the situation thrown up by the pandemic. “These kinds of incidents rarely have positive effects for any country, in general. There are ways countries can take advantage of (it). What I think we can say is that there will have to be a rethinking of everything in the global economy once we are out of this,” he said.“India can find opportunity for its industry and supply chain in the world. It can also help make its voice heard in the global order,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-video-conversation-with-rahul-rajan-suggests-65k-crore-aid-for-poor/story-CtrtvW6HErR16L9m1t9wHP.html
