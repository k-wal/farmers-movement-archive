13-05-2020||News||Allocate resources, rationally and efficiently||Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s speech on May 12 had two central messages: India will have to learn to live with the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), and India must pivot towards economic recovery. The recovery strategy will be pursued through a package of fiscal and monetary measures and a reforms package. In some ways, this is an intensification of existing efforts. Since 2017, consumption expenditure financed by the government has grown rapidly — at an average real rate of 10.6%. Big reforms — the Goods and Services Tax (GST), insolvency reform, inflation targeting — have been implemented. India’s rank in the Ease of Doing Business index has improved from 130 in 2016 to 63 in 2019. But economic growth has slowed down from 8.3% in 2016-17 to 5% in 2019-20. As a percentage of GDP, new project announcements by the private sector were the lowest in 2019-20 since the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy began the data series in 1995-96.This central paradox of recent years needs to be considered while assessing the recovery strategy. We need to worry about how the policies work, and not just admire the list of announcements.On fiscal support, three facts are important to consider. First, no matter which nuclear option is used to expand resource availability, fiscal resources will be scarce. Tax, dividends, spectrum auction and other receipts will fall sharply. A significant part of the expenditure is committed, including Rs 7.1 lakh crore of interest expenditure in 2020-21. Expenditure on schemes such as the employment guarantee scheme and food subsidy will increase. Second, since the crisis is destroying considerable value in the economy, there will be many competing demands on fiscal resources. To avoid a fiscal crisis later, the government must spend its limited resources efficiently. Third, our expenditure system is plagued with a number of allocative and operational inefficiencies. This crisis necessitates comprehensive expenditure management reforms. Considering the above will give the government a sense of the budget constraint in which it can support the economy. Given that we may need to live with Covid-19 for another year, there seem to be three good uses of money at this time.First, the government can help restart economic activity while Covid-19 is still a threat. Many who are rightly worried about attracting the wrath of the virus may stay away from economic activities. We need to lower the subjective probability that people place on getting the virus, and dying from it. This requires intensifying public health measures (screening, testing, quarantine and treatment efforts); expanding public transport deficits to ensure social distancing; and increasing resources for public order. These efforts can reduce the economic costs of the crisis, and preserve economic value. While firms, communities and families can contribute, these efforts will cost fiscal resources. Most of these activities are in the realm of state and local governments, which are resource-starved at the moment. So, a large part of the fiscal package should be given to the states to spend.Second, while the government has announced relief measures, it is becoming obvious that many vulnerable sections, especially informal and migrant workers, are falling through the cracks. As the unemployment rate is around 25%, and many households are struggling to make ends meet, there is a duty to ensure relief reaches them in a timely manner. One of the systems that must be reformed urgently is the integrated management of the public distribution system, so that food subsidy can be availed anywhere across the country. More cash transfers may also be required.Third, since uncertainty is limiting the effectiveness of liquidity measures, they need to be supplemented with fiscal measures. Solutions such as creating a bad bank or doing anticipatory recapitalisation cannot reduce this uncertainty. The government has announced a scheme to give complete guarantees for loans given to micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). This leaves little incentive for banks and Non-Banking Financial Companies to identify the firms that are likely to survive the crisis with loan support. It would be better to give partial guarantees. Similarly, the government needs to be hardnosed about spending money. It is perhaps not a good idea to infuse resources into weaker MSMEs (Rs 20,000 crore subordinate debt) during such a crisis.On the reforms package, two points are worth keeping in mind. First, the government should send a message to its enforcement authorities that this is a moment to be pragmatic about their approach to businesses, as they struggle to cope with this crisis. The de jure policy changes are not enough, unless the overall political stance towards businesses and market changes. In the last few years, there has been a rise in the government’s hostility towards the private sector, as evidenced by the rise in tax disputes and actions of enforcement authorities. Second, the implementation and de facto integrity of reforms matter, as the example of GST shows. Reforms do not automatically lead to good outcomes. Unless we are careful, we may do more harm than good in our response to this crisis. This is about achieving rational action when fear is all around us. The question for us, as a country, is to paraphrase Rudyard Kipling: Can you keep your head when all about you are losing theirs?||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/allocate-resources-rationally-and-efficiently/story-ESaL5Os4cmpUktGMyPBLOI.html

Hence, I have asked all senior inspectors of the 21 police stations in my region to counsel the migrants and to keep them updated with travel updates so that they do not panic and leave on their own. Our patrolling teams have been asked to use mega phones to make announcements to keep them updated about train travel details in advance so that they are aware when their turn will come.” So far, 16 trains with 22,400 people stranded in west region (Bandra to Jogeshwari) have commenced while around 44,800 people are on waiting list.

We know they have no money or jobs, and hence we are counselling them and ensuring that we send them home safely as soon as possible. I have personally told my staff not to shout, misbehave, or manhandle any migrants.” “We recently caught a truck with 90 migrants. We counselled them and brought them back to their factory. We provided them food with the help of an NGO, and recently we sent them to their states by train,” Sawant said. Sakinaka police has also constructed a temporary tent at Sangharsh Nagar where migrants come to collect their food. “On Tuesday night around 5,000 people from Sakinaka, Meghwadi, Powai, and Jogeshwari were sent to their home states in four trains which left from LTT and CSMT stations,” said Ankit Goyal DCP, zone 10.484 cases of Covid-19 in city police, 68 recovered, 5 dead The Mumbai Police till Wednesday reported 484 cases of Covid-19, most of the patients are asymptomatic.

13-05-2020||Mumbai||Police machinery under great stress: Bombay HC||The Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday said that the “police machinery is under great stress and strain” and directed the Maharashtra government to relieve police personnel of Covid-19 duties wherever possible by engaging other public servants for the duties.“For example, if migrant workers, displaced persons or students desire to return to their native places and need to register themselves, the government and the local administration can utilise ‘of-duty’ employees of the revenue department, to ease the burden on the police department,” said justice Ravindra Ghuge.The judge noted that in its endeavour to prevent the spread of Covid-19, the state government has deployed police almost everywhere. “Police personnel are deployed on streets, at railway stations, in various localities, and are even asked to handle applications for seeking travel passes and permissions to migrate,” said the judge.He added that several revenue employees are not on duty and the government should consider deploying these employees, especially those below 50 years of age, to deal with such activities and issues for which police presence is not a must.Justice Ghuge was hearing a suo-motu petition concerning several issues relating to the Covid-19 pandemic.The court also directed the authorities to provide appropriate protection to corona warriors – doctors and paramedics working round the clock for treatment of Covid-19 patients. It took note of the threats by residents to a staff nurse working with the district general hospital at Aurangabad and directed the authorities to register offences against such individuals who threaten, abuse, or assault medical or paramedical staff. “I am of the view that the time has come to direct the authorities concerned to register offences against such residents,” said the bench.Locals in Aurangabad had threatened to assault the husband and son of the staff nurse if the family failed to leave the locality and damaged their car. The court was informed that the residents of the locality in a City Industrial Development Corporation Ltd (Cidco) area were apprehensive that the staff nurse would introduce the coronavirus in the locality. The threats stopped only after local police stepped in.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/police-machinery-under-great-stress-bombay-hc/story-yyB8R6pEBTecvdkFbFyA1K.html
13-05-2020||Chandigarh||A day before train leaves, labourers crowd Bathinda railway ground||A day before the Shramik Express carrying 1,188 migrant workers is scheduled to leave for Motihari in Bihar at 11am on Thursday, around 1,500 migrant labourers crowded the railway ground near the station on Wednesday. On Sunday, a train had left for Muzaffarpur in Bihar and another for Daltonganj in Jharkhand from the city, carrying around 2,600 passengers in total. Thursday’s train will be the third ‘Shramik Express’ from Bathinda. Usually, only passengers who get an SMS from the administration are allowed to board the train. “With the crowd a potential health hazard, the administration managed to shift them to other places,” said Bathinda SDM Amarinder Singh Tiwana, adding that many of those who came on Wednesday were from Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand.“The Shramik Express stops only at the destination assigned to it. Over 1,500 had arrived on Wednesday itself and more are coming; around half of them were employed with the Guru Gobind Singh Refinery. We are mulling making other arrangements.”Ajay Yadav of Bhojpur in Bihar said he had walked 30km to reach the station in the hope of going back. The SDM added, “Despite our best efforts to allow only those who get the message to board the train, sometimes we have to get them to stand in a queue and take the required number to the station.”1,200 leave from AmritsarIn Amritsar, around 1,200 migrants left for their native places on the 7th Shramik Express to Ambedkar Nagar in Uttar Pradesh on Wednesday. SDM Vikas Hira said, “All migrants were screened and given food packets. Around 8,000 have left since the trains started.” Of the labourers, 54 had come from Gurdaspur. A Shramik Express will leave for Kanpur (Uttar Pradesh) from Ferozepur, the first from the district, on Thursday at 7pm.Mohali sends 1,304 homeThe seventh special train on Wednesday left the Mohali railway station carrying 1,304 migrant workers back to Bettiah in Bihar. Of the labourers, 764 were from Mohali, with 540 from Dera Bassi. 12 from Hoshiarpur start  walk to UP; interceptedTwelve migrant workers, out-of-work for two months, set out on foot for native Uttar Pradesh on Wednesday, only to be intercepted 25km away in Hoshiarpur city and sent back to their temporary abode.Ram Din, Raj Kumar, Nakul, Bharat and Avdhesh said they worked as daily wagers with the forest department and had registered with the administration for transport, but frustrated at not getting a call, decided to walk to their native place in Mahrajganj district of UP. —With inputs from Amritsar, Mohali, Ferozepur and Hoshiarpur||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/a-day-before-train-leaves-labourers-crowd-bathinda-railway-ground/story-i80z85Ygf9hk8sbWxEKfRL.html
13-05-2020||Mumbai||Withdraw green nods given during lockdown: Conservationists to minister||Conservationists have expressed their concerns about issuance of environmental clearances for large projects in forests and ecologically fragile regions, during the Covid-19 pandemic. Citing that the environment ministry is responsible for upholding forest, wildlife and environment protection, 291 conservation scientists, academics from premier wildlife research institutes, wildlife biologists, 12 former members of the standing committee of the National Board for Wildlife (NBWL), former affiliates of the Forest Advisory Committee (FAC), and academics from universities such as Columbia, Yale, Michigan, and Cambridge, and non-profit bodies among others, wrote a letter to Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar on Tuesday.The letter criticised the approvals for infrastructure, industrial and mining projects in critical wildlife habitats during lockdown. The writers opposed the idea of consultations and meetings through video-conferencing to evaluate the environmental impact of projects rather than waiting for the lockdown to end when projects could be appraised through site inspections and public hearings. The conservationists called for the withdrawal of clearances issued by expert panels under the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEFCC) during the lockdown as well as temporary suspension of all decisions taken via video-conferencing until pandemic-related travel restrictions are lifted.“The environment ministry has bulldozed major forest clearances during lockdown even as the pandemic is a glaring reminder of the consequences of toying with nature,” said Asad Rahmani, former director, Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS), one of the signatories. Former NBWL member Kishore Rithe said, “As our protected areas (only 4% of country’s total geographic area) are the country’s last remaining wildlife habitats, granting clearance to any project proposed inside them should be the last resort. NBWL needs to check the authenticity of information provided by project proponents which includes status of the forest land, notifications, maps, and orders passed by the courts. The lockdown does not allow fair screening of 40% of major proposals that need site inspection.”On April 7 during the 57th meeting of NBWL’s Standing Committee, 31 proposals affecting 15 tiger reserves, sanctuaries, buffer zones and wildlife corridors were considered. Of these proposals, 16 linear infrastructure projects, which pass through protected areas, were issued clearances. Javadekar, who had chaired the meeting, had issued approvals for projects from 11 different states.Expert Appraisal Committees (EAC), bodies under the ministry, on April 22-24 approved a slew of infrastructure project proposals as part of considering 145 projects between April and June. Ten EACs have conducted 15 meetings in this regard so far, according to the Union environment ministry’s Parivesh portal.The letter suggested that under normal circumstances, EAC meetings would last an entire day. In comparison, meetings during the lockdown had lasted only two hours, with only 10 minutes to appraise each project. “We urge that all meetings of the NBWL, FAC and all 10 EACs be postponed as long as travel restrictions are in place,” the letter read. While two projects were recently deferred during an FAC meet on April 23, the FAC subcommittee on April 21 recommended the Etalin Hydropower Project in Arunachal Pradesh’s Dibang Valley which collectively harbours one of the richest biodiversity on earth, as well as exploration for Uranium in Telangana’s Amrabad Tiger Reserve. Both projects led to massive social media campaigns against the proposals. “It is inexcusable that our government continues to pursue a development model which depends on destroying nature, especially when there is sufficient evidence of more sustainable options,” said Dr Ravi Chellam, wildlife biologist.The letter also quoted a Supreme Court judgment from 2011 which allowed French cement company Lafarge to mine limestone in a forest in Meghalaya after issuing guidelines to be followed in such cases. As part of the guidelines, MoEFCC was asked to frame a comprehensive policy for inspection, verification and monitoring procedure by forest officials along with regional MoEFCC officials to ascertain the status of forests before granting clearances, and appoint a ‘national regulator’ for appraising projects. “The compliance of these guidelines may not be possible during the lockdown period which may amount to a serious deviation in the clearance process,” the letter read, adding that the MoEFCC was relying only on digital documents uploaded by project developers on the ministry’s portal.“Shockingly, key guidelines are being ignored, including the failure to appoint a National Regulator for appraising projects. MoEFCC appears to be abdicating its constitutional obligation of ensuring environmental protection. Granting fast-track clearances has now become the rule,” said Praveen Bhargav, former NBWL member.Minister of State for Environment Babul Supriyo declined to comment on the letter. However, a senior MoEFCC official said, “Every project undergoes careful scrutiny before issuance of clearances. We must also consider the importance of economic growth and sustainable development, especially during the current Covid-19 crisis.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/withdraw-green-nods-given-during-lockdown-conservationists-to-minister/story-mz0KMoglaHT6uSzuhvMAWL.html

Sources said the education department plans to keep schools shut, but is awaiting further instructions from the Government of India. Director of school education (DSE) Rubinderjit Singh Brar said there no decision has been taken yet. “Whatever is decided, you will be informed,” he said.“Senior officials will take a call in a day or so,” informed sources. UT education secretary also deliberated on the issue with district education officer (DEO), Alka Mehta and Rubinderjit Singh Brar.Teachers, however, expressed anxiety over the delay. A teacher requesting anonymity said, “We are flooded with calls from parents and students, but we too have no idea. As per orders, schools were to begin May 15, and teachers and students have been asked to report to school.”If students aren’t informed on time, one can expect chaos in government schools, the teacher said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/students-teachers-clueless-as-govt-dilly-dallies-on-opening-chandigarh-schools/story-QPqphvlQ71DWX4nf6McfNO.html

13-05-2020||City||864 test sample results from Ghaziabad pending||Officials from Ghaziabad’s health department on Wednesday said that the number of pending Covid-19 reports for the district had gone up to 864. The testing machine at National Institute of Biologicals (NIB), Noida, had malfunctioned on Saturday evening, after which more than 100 samples were immediately moved to Government Institute of Medical Sciences. Ever since then, all samples being collected in the district are being sent to the testing lab in Meerut.“At present, we are collecting about 150 to 200 samples per day. These were earlier being sent to NIB lab at Noida. Since their machine developed a snag, we have been forced to send these samples to Meerut for testing. As a result, the number of our pending reports have shot up and stood at 864 till Wednesday evening,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer (CMO) for the district.“We have about 12 Covid-19 positive patients, whose follow-up test reports are also held up. Apart from this, other reports related to samples taken from contacts who came in touch with Covid-19 patients have also been held up. About 250 test reports from Ghaziabad are also awaited from NIB, Noida. These samples were taken from hotspot areas in Khoda, Vijay Nagar and also Jhandapur which have seen spike in recent days,” CMO added.Even those lodged in quarantine centres are awaiting their reports, even as they grow restless.“Seven members of my family, including my three-month-old daughter, are in quarantine but their test reports are still awaited. We all are waiting for the reports eagerly as we want to move out and attend the last rites and rituals of my mother,” said a resident of Pratap Vihar, who is presently housed in one of the quarantine centres.His mother had tested positive for Covid, according to test reports from a private lab, and died at a private hospital on April 30.“The test reports of the family is stuck and we expect that pending reports of patients or people in hospitals and quarantine centres are released soon, so that they can get discharged at the earliest.The source of infection of the 60 year-old-woman from Pratap Vihar will be known once all the test reports of her family are received,” the CMO added.Meanwhile, an official from NIB, Noida, said that the technical snag of their testing machine had been rectified on Wednesday and they had started testing samples again. Meanwhile, the total number of Covid-19 patients in Ghaziabad stood at 145 on Wednesday, after two more tested positive for the virus. The district so far has witnessed two deaths related to the virus.“The two cases, which tested positive on Wednesday, are related to two women. One is related to the mother of a Delhi police woman constable who had earlier tested positive in Delhi. Her 52 year old mother, who stays at Dasna Gate, tested positive today (Wednesday). The second case is from Loni, where a 45-year-old woman who was getting cancer treatment in Delhi, and tested positive. Hers is a case of medically acquired infection,” the CMO added.The officials of the Uttar Pradesh government said that the number of patients who got discharged have surpassed the number of active cases in the state.“We have about 1,744 active cases in the state while 1,759 patients have been discharged till Wednesday evening.

13-05-2020||City||Caught in protocols and indecision, body of Covid patient takes 7 hours to reach Ghaziabad from Meerut||Indecision and procedural holdups led to an inordinate delay in the burial of a 60-year-old from Ghaziabad, who had succumbed to co-morbid conditions triggered by Covid-19 at the L3 hospital in Meerut on Tuesday evening. Officials said that the burial finally could take place around 2am on Wednesday in Ghaziabad, after an almost seven hour delay. According to norms laid down by the Central government, bodies of Covid-19 patients are to be cremated/buried at the earliest, while ensuring all safety norms. According to victim’s family, the man developed mild fever and was referred from MMG Hospital in Ghaziabad to Meerut Medical College on April 9. Test results later confirmed him positive for Covid-19 and the man died around 5.30pm on Tuesday.However, it took officials more than seven hours to ferry the body from Meerut to Ghaziabad, a distance of merely 55km.“Initially, there was a demand from officials of Meerut that Ghaziabad sends a vehicle to take the body. The issue was cleared after lot of discussions and Meerut officials decided to send body in their vehicle. As per norms, the last rites can take place in the district where the death has taken place. If the family requests, the district will send the body to the home district in their vehicle,” said a health department official from Ghaziabad.Another issue cropped up when officials figured out the name of the victim. Ghaziabad health officials said that they were under the impression that the body had to be cremated, but later figured that they needed to bury it.“The confusion was cleared around 11pm on Tuesday when we came to know that the deceased had to be buried because of his religion and a place for the same needs to be prepared. This was because we had no records of the patients with us and he died at Meerut during treatment. After the body left Meerut in a vehicle, it stopped midway at Modinagar. We were told that we need to send some officer to formally receive the body there. Once that issue was sorted, the vehicle finally arrived at Ghaziabad around 1am on Wednesday,” the officer said.The family of the deceased said that they were also amazed at the turn of events, which led to hours of delay.“We received information of death round 5.30pm on Tuesday and were told that burial will take place in Meerut. When we reached Modinagar, we got a call from Meerut that the burial will now take place in Ghaziabad. We had made no request for a burial in Ghaziabad as there was a risk of the infection spreading during transportation,” said the elder son of the deceased.“After we reached Meerut around 10pm, the vehicle started its journey. But, it stopped midway for an hour in Modinagar. Again we made number of calls and officials of both districts spoke to each other. Once the issue was cleared, the vehicle reached Ghaziabad around 1am. Thereafter, the body was buried as we stayed about 400 metres away from the site,” he added.The family stays at Kaila Kheda locality near Pratap Vihar in Ghaziabad.Ghaziabad chief medical officer Dr NK Gupta said that the Meerut officials sent the body in their vehicle.“There was confusion about protocols, vehicle and responsibilities of officials from the two districts. We were regularly in touch with Meerut officials and both sides worked out the issues over calls. The body arrived at Ghaziabad and we had made all arrangements for the burial. It took place around 1.30am on Wednesday,” he added.Dr Raj Kumar, chief medical officer of Meerut district, said that there was no delay on their part.“There was no delay in transportation as such. The designated officer of Ghaziabad did not reach Modinagar so the vehicle halted there for 15 to 20 minutes. We did not take any request in writing from deceased’s family, but they verbally told us that burial should be done in Ghaziabad. So we made arrangements accordingly,” he added.Dr RC Gupta, the principal of Meerut Medical College, said that there were several protocols which had to be followed and that may have resulted in delays.“The patient was admitted on April 9 and later tested positive for Covid-19. He suffered from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and developed comorbid conditions. There was no confusion in transportation of body,” Dr Gupta said.“His family has a right to seek burial in their home district if they wish to. In such a case, the CMO from here (Meerut) sent the body in vehicle and the CMO of Ghaziabad made arrangements for last rites.

AOA office-bearers of Sapphire II have allegedly stopped supply from a borewell to Saphhire I flats, says a complaint addressed to authorities. Both housing societies have about 1,000 flats each and are separated by a temporary wall. There are two borewells and water storage tanks in Sapphire I and three in Sapphire II. In a complaint, the AOA of Sapphire I alleged that Sapphire II AOA stopped water supply on Monday evening from one of its borewells.“Since Tuesday morning, we are not getting adequate supply and are surviving on limited supply from the two borewells we have. We have filed a complaint with the court receiver and other authorities for immediate action because without water we will suffer amid this pandemic and ongoing lockdown. The AOA of Sapphire II keeps troubling us in this manner quite often,” Anisur Rahman, president, AOA Sapphire I, said.Amrapali Group had delivered Sapphire I and II projects in 2014 partially, but most of the common facilities were not ready for use. The clubhouse, swimming pool, and grocery store are located in Sapphire I and are fully functional. These facilities are yet to be developed in Sapphire II and that became a bone of contention.Sapphire II residents said Sapphire I did not allow them to use the club house, pool or grocery store. The water supply issue is the latest in a long list of standoffs, residents said. “I am not aware of how water supply got disrupted. But the background is that Sapphire I people did not let us use the clubhouse and even now during this crisis, they are not letting us use the grocery store. The water tank is located in our area. If Sapphire I will send a letter or call us for help, then we will resume the supply,” Abhishek Kumar, secretary of Amarapali Sapphire II, said.On July 23, 2019, the Supreme Court had appointed the court receiver to carry out various activities, such as registration of ready flats, accepting money from buyers, selling unsold flats, and ensuring completion of stuck housing projects etc. In March, 2019 Amrapali chairman and managing director Anil Sharma and two other promoters were sent to Tihar Jail for regularities, including delaying projects. They are still in jail and now NBCC has been tasked with finishing the remaining projects, including the common facilities in Sapphire II, officials said.“We have got a complaint from AOA of Sapphire I. There are some long pending issues pertaining to common facilities, which will be settled soon. The two AOAs can settle their issues though dialogue,” R Ventakramni, the court receiver, said.The Noida authority said it was an internal matter of the AOAs.“We received a complaint on this but we got to know that the water supply from our end is proper. One AOA has cut the supply to the other. Therefore they will sort it out themselves,” BM Pokhriyal, deputy general manger, Noida authority water department, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/amid-lockdown-dispute-between-residents-bodies-leads-to-water-crisis-in-sapphire-society/story-7FjvwNXySpt6PqujOTGxcL.html

Sometimes I get called for guard duty but I don’t make nearly as much as I used to. My wife only got partial wages this month. For several days in the past week, we slept on an empty stomach,” said the husband, requesting anonymity for himself and for his wife. “Some relatives of ours live in Sector 2. On Monday afternoon, my wife and our 10-year-old son walked seven km to their house and she borrowed Rs 5,000 from them. On their way back, around 2.30 pm, two motorcycle-borne men, who had their faces covered, snatched my wife’s purse and sped away,” he said. When HT asked to speak to his wife for a comment, he said his wife is scared and does not wish to speak to the media. He said the incident took place at the Atta Peer red light near Sector 18.He said his wife is illiterate and could not note the number plate of the vehicle, nor could she recognise the snatchers. She then called him up, and he drive his rickshaw to the spot to pick them up, he added.“I could not go to the relative’s house myself as cycle rickshaws are not permitted to ply on roads due to the lockdown. Luckily, my wife and son were not injured. But now, not only do we have no money, we are in debt with no way to pay it off. Some people have come forward to help us with ration. In addition, our elder son (18) who is back home in Bihar with his grandparents, as well as some other family members, are dependent on us but we don’t have the means to help them anymore,” he said, adding that he could However, the husband said he did not inform the police as his previous attempt of reporting a crime did not go down well.“Three months back, my phone was snatched in Sector 18. A passenger in my rickshaw took my phone on the pretext of transferring the fare through PayTM as he didn’t have cash on him. But instead of paying, he fled with my phone. I went to at least three police stations with my complaint but everybody kept referring me to a different police station. I ran from pillar to post but no help came. Why would this time be any different?” said the husband.The police said the incident has been brought to the notice of police officials by media persons and the family has been contacted by local cops. He said a complaint will be filed at the Sector 20 police station. “We will have the case investigated along with the three month old incident and take necessary action,” said deputy commissioner of police, zone 1, Sankalp Sharma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-woman-walks-7km-to-borrow-5-000-robbed-on-her-way-home/story-qo6EMDua7QgWgNCZe5z8nN.html
13-05-2020||City||Migrant workers prefer trucks to a bus home, refuse to stay at shelter homes||More than 2,000 migrant labourers gathered at Morta near the Delhi-Meerut road on Wednesday morning in a bid to catch a bus home, only to be told by district administration officials that the buses left a day before. The workers, most of them are natives of Bihar and other districts of Uttar Pradesh, reached Ghaziabad from different parts of Haryana and Delhi after they came to know that some buses would be run for their home towns from Morta. Though the officials asked the labourers to stay at shelter homes for a few days after which buses would be arranged for them, but they decided to not wait in the city and moved on to the highway to catch a truck.Pooja, a 23-year-old migrant worker from Gonda district in UP, had arrived with her husband and their one-and-a- half years old child. She said that they came from Mandoli in Delhi and paid Rs 200 each to a truck driver who dropped them to Morta.“We waited for hours at Morta but there was no bus. Hundreds of workers like us waited along the roadside and in nearby green belts, but we were driven away by the police. Then we decided to walk to our home town. We have hardly Rs 500 left with us. So, we are going to highway to catch a truck,” she said.Ravi Kumar, who arrived from Jagatpuri in Delhi, said that he would prefer to catch some passing truck.“Migrant workers were driven away by the police. Even the women and those having children with them were not spared. There were no buses for us. I just have Rs 50 left with me and I decided to travel afoot to my home town. With no buses available, everyone is now trying to catch some truck or any commercial vehicle,” said Ravi, a daily wager who is a native of Madhepura in Bihar.On Wednesday, several groups of migrant workers were seen sitting along the roadsides at Delhi-Meerut Road, Raj Nagar, Kavi Nagar and other localities near NH-9.“We came here after knowing that buses were going from Morta in Ghaziabad. It has been three days since I have been walking along with my friend to reach Ghaziabad. Trucks are still our best bet. We will request drivers to drop us midway from where look out for some other truck. We don’t have money to pay for train fare. Besides, many of us don’t even have smartphones so that we can book (online) tickets. I borrowed Rs 1,000 from a friend and came to Morta,” said Monal Kumar Mondol, a native of Bhagalpur in Bihar who worked as daily wager in Panipat, Haryana.His friend Ranjeet Kumar, who is also a native of Bhagalpur, said that they are now solely dependent on langars and food items which are distributed to them by locals.Ghaziabad police officials said that some buses left on Tuesday night and took along workers who were present in shelter homes.“It seems that more and more workers are coming from Delhi and Haryana after coming to know about the operation of buses from Morta. On Wednesday, about two thousand migrants arrived and it led to a huge build-up. So, we had to disperse them but no force was used. There have been strict instructions to our personnel not to misbehave with any migrant worker,” said Neeraj Kumar Jadaun, superintendent of police (rural).A senior district administration officer said that it’s difficult to communicate with migrant workers stranded in Delhi and Haryana. “They generally come after rumours spread by people in their respective states. We ask the migrant workers who arrive here to stay at our shelter homes. We are facing problems as they prefer travelling by trucks and other commercial vehicles,” the officer said, on condition of anonymity.“Migrant workers staying at shelter homes are being ferried by buses and they are the ones who are given information about buses. We have about 150-200 buses, which have left Ghaziabad so far in the past one week. One of our shelter homes at Apsara Garden in Morta is vacant as migrant workers are not ready to stay and everyone wants to continue their travel. If they stay, they will be given proper food and lodging,” the official added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/migrant-workers-prefer-trucks-to-a-bus-home-refuse-to-stay-at-shelter-homes/story-du1AT9kuq29OdnlZTiGozL.html
13-05-2020||Mumbai||Industries may face workforce crunch as 6-8 lakh migrants leave||The large scale exodus of migrant workers from Maharashtra amid the Covid-19 lockdown is likely to pose a challenge to industries that are expected to become operational in phases.With 6 to 8 lakh migrant workers on their way out of Maharashtra, the state government has now launched its own mechanism to provide the skilled workers required by industries, by roping in local unemployed youth.The state has sent more than 1.5 lakh migrants back to their hometowns by arranging 70 trains and over 2,500 state transport buses to transport them. The government has also demanded at least 225 more trains to transport migrants from cities like Mumbai, Thane, Navi Mumbai, Nashik, and Pune.Several migrants travelled out of the state in private vehicles.The state government had made arrangements for 5.70 lakh migrants in more than 4,600 shelter camps since the lockdown was imposed on March 24. The number has now come down to 3.84 lakh migrants at 3,164 camps across the state.“The labour department had registered about 2 lakh workers living in the shelters during the lockdown. Besides this, some migrant workers live at their worksites or in rented homes. Around 15-20 lakh people are expected to migrate back to their home states, and of them, 6-8 lakh are expected to be labourers,” said an official from the relief and rehabilitation department. According to the 2011 census, Maharashtra has more than 38 lakh migrants living mostly in the urbanised areas of the state.Sensing a challenge in the days ahead, the state government has decided to form a Kamgar Bureau which will enroll the local unemployed youths and impart them with training in various fields. “It will be a joint venture of industries and the skilled development and labour department, to generate the workforce required by various sectors,” said Subhash Desai, industries minister.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, in his video conference on Wednesday, directed the district authorities to ensure that local youths fill the gap created due to the exodus of migrant workers.Manohar Shroff, senior vice president, Navi Mumbai unit of Maharashtra Chamber of Housing Industry (MCHI) said that the construction industry will suffer a lot, and projects will get delayed due to the labour shortage. “The real estate projects will be delayed by four to six months due to the crunch of workers. At least 70% of them will not even return,” he said.Since the government has allowed the partial operations of industries with a limited workforce, the manufacturing industry is currently not facing any crunch. “But four to six months down the line, we may face a crunch of workers,” said Ram Bhogale, former president, Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture.According to officials, migrant workers who have been protected with schemes like provident fund and health insurance may return but there is no such surety about the others. Officials said that the government may even have to roll out incentives to attract them back in the coming months.State receives 511 complaints of job, pay cutsThe state government received 511 complaints of lay-offs and salary cuts during the lockdown, in response to its appeal to employers not to issue pink slips to employees. “Of them, 362 have been successfully disposed by mediation and making employers withdraw their decision of lay-offs or salary cuts. Some of them were even found to be fake and 149 are in the process of action. Of the total complaints, 205 are from Konkan and 127 from Pune division,” said Raviraj Ilawe, joint commissioner of labour. 8 migrants injured after vehicle topples in ThaneA small transport vehicle carrying 25 labourers toppled at Cadbury Junction in Thane on Wednesday after the driver lost control of the vehicle. Eight labourers were injured. The labourers had hired the vehicle from Masjid Bunder to take them to Bhiwandi and from there they planned to go to their village in Uttar Pradesh.The Rabodi police have registered a case against the tempo driver, Najir Qureshi, 35. “The tempo was speeding and rammed into the divider and turned turtle,” said an officer of Rabodi police station.100 migrants booked by Nagpada policeThe Nagpada police have booked more than 100 migrants for gathering and protesting on Wednesday morning near Kamathipura. The crowd was demanding immediate transport to Uttar Pradesh. “We told them that we are making efforts to get a train as approval must come from the concerned state too. The crowd alleged migrants from other areas were getting trains to reach home and questioned the delay for those in Nagpada,” said a police officer from Nagpada police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/industries-may-face-workforce-crunch-as-6-8-lakh-migrants-leave/story-8Hf7dBV4RU0oAJSxFAIwlL.html
13-05-2020||Mumbai||Waldhuni river turns red; locals files fresh complaint with CPCB||Waldhuni, a river that provides drinking water to the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) has turned red due to discharge of untreated industrial effluents. On Tuesday, members of the Ulhasnagar Citizens Forum, a residents’ body, filed a fresh complaint with the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) attaching photographs of the polluted river turning red (see image).“After decisions have been taken to allow industries to function during lockdown-3, there has been a surge in production, but at the same time common effluent treatment plants (CETPs) are dysfunctional,” said Satyajit Burman, member of the citizen’s forum.“Despite repeated complaints, government bodies are violating the law along with industries dumping chemical effluents directly into the river leading to serious health problems for the entire Thane district,” said Burman.The Ulhas river and its tributary, the Waldhuni, drinking water to more than 30 lakh residents in the Thane-Badlapur. The water is pumped out from the higher reaches of the rivers before it reaches the industrial area. A water quality report from last year of samples from the drinking water zone of the rivers by residents at private lab showed the water was highly polluted.Local municipal bodies said they were not aware of the issue as they were busy dealing with Covid-19 matters.SL Waghmare, regional officer, MPCB said, “This section of the Waldhuni river does not meet Ulhas river at all, and drains at Ulhas creek before entering the sea. There is no threat to the drinking water of the Thane-Badlapur belt due to these industrial effluents. However, there is a threat to the natural environment and biodiversity of the creek. We will soon have our inspection results in the matter.”HT had reported that the Central Pollution Control Board had taken cognisance of increasing water pollution in Waldhuni last month and directed the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) to act on complaints.“The red colour seems to be coming from either dye industries or bulk drug-producing (pharmaceutical) plants,” said Waghmare. “A list has been made of such units and investigation on the source of this pollution began on Wednesday. We will be filing a detailed inspection report and taking action against violators.”According to Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation, there 30,115 industrial units functioning across the state during lockdown with 8.06 lakh employees working. Of this MMR has around 386 functional units mostly sanitiser production and pharmaceutical bodies. “Strict orders were issued to units to ensure treatment of waste before discharge. With MPCB’s help, we will be identifying the polluting bodies,” said Kalidas Bandekar, superintendent engineer (MMR), MIDC.Meanwhile, high water pollution continues even though the matter is pending before the Supreme Court. Petitioners said they will be filing fresh applications against the Maharashtra government and all pollution abatement agencies that they were in contempt of court orders. “A free run has been given to perennial violators by all concerned government bodies in this lockdown. We are forced to move the SC,” said Stalin D, director, Vanashakti.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/waldhuni-river-turns-red-locals-files-fresh-complaint-with-cpcb/story-JEH15rIi2uHszeC8G7M1EK.html

Out of which two have been shifted, while the one at Khanpur is yet to be shifted to allow elevation.Jain said, “PSTCL was facing labour issues, but we have directed them to complete the shifting of high-tension wires by June 20.”Earlier, in February, Punjab public works minister Vijay Inder Singla, in reply to question by Kharar MLA Kanwar Sandhu, said the new deadline for the Balongi-Khanpur flyover project in Kharar was September 2020.After reviewing the progress of the work, Jain said, “I was assured in the meet that service lanes will be completed by the first week of June. When the new Khanpur bridge to comes up by July end, the old one would be demolished and the entry and exit points of the flyover would be constructed.” Efforts on to bring back labour from Uttar Pradesh“Skilled labourers deployed by L&T are stuck in Uttar Pradesh. We are tying-up with authorities in Uttar Pradesh to get them back and add pace to work,” added Jain, who is overseeing the progress of the flyover.However, the work of making service lanes and construction of the Kharar flyover has picked pace. About 375 local labourers have been deployed at the site to complete the work. Traffic has been diverted to one side of the flyover which is leading to bottlenecks.The 10-km Kharar-Chandigarh road expansion project that entails construction of two flyovers and three bridges and the authorities is struggling to meet the fifth deadline of the project. The NHAI had handed over the ₹368-crore project to Larsen & Toubro (L&T) and the construction began in November 2015. It was to be completed by December 2018. However, in the past four years only 68% work was completed.Delays were on account of shifting the start point of the flyover from Dara Studio to Balongi due to agitation by locals in June 2016, issues of land acquisition, disbursement of compensation, demolition of critical structures and limitations of traffic diversion in the area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/labour-shortage-hits-work-on-kharar-flyover-but-admn-hopeful-of-meeting-sept-deadline/story-I4yOv3HZXlOicWqHLW3jzO.html
13-05-2020||Mumbai||Single mega permission for new industries in Maharashtra: State government||In an attempt to woo investors in Maharashtra, the state government has planned to provide single permission named as ‘Maha Parwana’ (mega permission) for the industries to invest in the state. It means that the investors do not need to get a number of permissions and clearances. The industries and their operations can be started instantly.Subhash Desai, state industries minister, said industries ready to invest will not have to run around for permission, as they will get a single ‘mega permission’ to start their operations. “Applicants will be given a ‘mega permission’ with the help of which, the units can be started instantly. Once, the industrial unit has started, the rest of the permissions can be obtained in the next two years,” the industries minister said.To deal with the shortage of workers, Desai also said that they would create a labour bureau with the help of state industries, labour and skill development departments. “The labour bureau would be compiling a list of workers and grade them as per their skills, such as skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled workers. They will also be provided training as per the requirement of the industries,” he said.The state is also planning to appoint relationship managers to interact with companies to resolve their issues if any.Meanwhile, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has appointed senior IAS officer Bhushan Gagrani as state coordination officer, for attracting new investment in Maharashtra. “Gagrani has been asked to prepare a blueprint for government to attract more foreign direct investment (FDI) particularly from Japan, US, Korea and Germany,” said a senior official.He said that they have formed a task force to attract foreign direct investment. Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) has also reserved 40,000 hectares of land for foreign investors. They are also working on a policy for pharmaceutical companies considering their willingness for investment.The order issued by the state industries department enumerates a number of responsibilities entrusted to Gagrani. It states, “Communication with various companies, business groups, consulates, trade organisations, associations, and prepare database; coordinate with industries department, Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) and other state undertakings and public sector units, in this context; produce required promotional material, arrange roadshows, meetings and conferences accordingly and coordinate with concerned ministries of the Government of India as per necessity.”State Industries development commissioner Harshdeep Kamble said that the state is also going to appoint relationship managers on the lines of private banks to interact with companies and solve their issues. “We are rolling out the red carpet for the industries and would be appointing relationship managers so that their issues can be resolved in no time,” said Kamble.Since April 20, the number of industrial units operational in Maharashtra has reached over 36,000. “We have given permission to 64,487 units to start their operations in the state so far. Of them, 36,383 units have started their operations with a workforce of over 10.26 lakh. We are expecting the rest of the industrial units will also start their operations in the coming days,” said a senior official from the state industries department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/single-mega-permission-for-new-industries-in-maharashtra-state-government/story-fBgLWcXxIIB3iofcaElG4H.html
13-05-2020||Mumbai||State requests Centre for 20 companies of CAPF to reduce police’s workload||Two days after chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi for additional central forces to support the state police, the home department on Wednesday, requested the Centre for the deployment of 20 companies of Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF) in Maharashtra. The state has demanded additional force of about 2,000 personnel to relieve the state police from excessive workload and for additional deployment during Eid on May 25. State home minister Anil Deshmukh on Wednesday said that the state police personnel were falling sick due to long working hours amid the Covid-19 lockdown and more and more police officers are testing positive for Sars-Cov-2, the virus which causes Covid-19. He said the deployment of central forces would allow the government to give some rest to the state personnel. “The police force has been fighting against the coronavirus day and night by putting in additional duty hours. Many of them have tested positive for the virus. The demand raised for the additional force is made while keeping in mind the ensuing festival of Eid on May 25,” he said.The state government has already deployed 32 companies of the State Reserve Police Force (SRPF) in various districts with rising Covid-19 cases. Around 84 police officers and 709 constables are undergoing treatment for Covid-19 in Maharashtra. Eight police constables including five in Mumbai have lost their lives to the novel coronavirus disease. According to home department officials, the additional force requested from the Centre is expected to be deployed in containment zones in cities like Mumbai, Pune and Malegaon.CM Thackeray, during his video conference on Monday, had requested the Prime Minister for additional force. Both the CM and the home minister clarified that the government does not intend to deploy the military in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/state-requests-centre-for-20-companies-of-capf-to-reduce-police-s-workload/story-KTVN3MvqNUL9VC8sGFUTTM.html

Declining the interim bail plea, the bench, holding proceedings via video-conferencing, said that it would hear the regular bail application in July.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for the CBI, and senior advocate Dushyant Dave, appearing for some riots victims, opposed the bail plea of the convict leader.Senior advocate Vikas Singh, representing Kumar, said that his client be granted bail as if something happens to him in jail then his life imprisonment would become death penalty for him. Kumar and Balwan Khokhar are serving life imprisonment in Tihar jail in the case after the Delhi high court convicted them on December 17, 2018.Khokhar has also sought parole in the case. His life sentence was upheld by the Delhi high court in 2018, while it had reversed the acquittal of Kumar by the trial court in 2013, in a case related to the killings of five Sikhs in the Raj Nagar Part-I area in Palam Colony in southwest Delhi on November 1-2, 1984, and burning down of a gurdwara in Raj Nagar Part-II. The riots had broken out after the assassination of then prime minister Indira Gandhi on October 31, 1984 by her two Sikh bodyguards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/anti-sikh-riot-casesc-declines-interim-bail-to-sajjan-kumar/story-imRl3rCV6ZzqITq4qitDwL.html

13-05-2020||Mumbai||Vacant middle seats won’t be needed as passengers sit facing forward: Air travel safety report||As the world prepares for the resumption of air travel, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and Airport Council International (ACI) stated that social distancing on board - like leaving the middle seat vacant - will not be necessary as passengers sit facing forward and not towards each other, and thus the risk of coronavirus transmission is low. In a recommendation document issued on the safety guidelines for passengers, the airports and airlines bodies, stated that the direction of the airflow on board acts as protection against the virus. It read, “... Customers sit facing forward and not towards each other, seatbacks provide a barrier, the use of HEPA filters and the direction of the airflow on board (from ceiling to floor), and the limited movement on board aircraft once seated, add to the protection. As an added protection against possible in-flight transmission, IATA recommends the use of face coverings by travellers in situations where physical distancing cannot be maintained, including in flight. In this regard, it should not be assumed that physical distancing on board (e.g. through blocked seats) would be necessary.”IATA and ACI recommended individual state governments to set up online portals for collecting contact information for passengers to be used for tracing purposes. In the recommendation document, ACI and IATA, stated that people who have recovered from Covid-19 should not have to undergo all the processes which have been put in place for general passengers to ensure their safe travel - during pre and post flights and while on board. The joint paper stated, “If a passenger could be documented as having recovered from Covid-19 and thus as being immune, they would not require many of the normal protections...boarding and on board processes, bypassing many of the protective steps such as face cover and temperature.”It also stated that the measures will have to be taken to ensure social distancing in the boarding area and passengers must be asked to self bag drop, to minimize interactions with check-in staff.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/vacant-middle-seats-won-t-be-needed-as-passengers-sit-facing-forward-airline-safety-report/story-sM3UF3sFE77zj95UaPkWoN.html

The misappropriation of ₹1.51 crore meant for development works was highlighted in the findings of an investigation carried out by Israna block development and panchayat officer (BDPO) Jitender Singh, a report of which he submitted to the office of Panipat deputy commissioner (DC). On the basis of the findings, DC Hema Sharma has given directions to chargesheet Didwadi under Section 7 of the Haryana Civil Services Act and issued a show-cause notice to the Mandi village head. PROBE FINDINGSThe BDPO in his investigation report has accused Didwadi of withdrawing the money meant for the Haryana rural development fund administration board from bank accounts of Mandi panchayat with the connivance of sarpanch Gurmit Singh and making payments to contractors without completion of projects in 2018-19. The report also states that the development works were not verified by the junior engineer and other authorised officials. Didwadi is also said to have used substandard material in the construction works in the village. However, Didwadi has refuted the allegations and termed them baseless. The 48-year-old said he was ready for any investigation and claimed that some officials were trying to defame him. He was awarded the Padma Shri, country’s fourth-highest civilian award, in 2019 by President Ram Nath Kovind for his successful venturing into rearing of livestock, particularly Murrah bull Golu, which is known for producing high-milk yielding buffaloes in Haryana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/padma-shri-awardee-from-panipat-accused-of-bungling-panchayat-funds/story-mHCOlosdRwzxY9vh5b9Y8N.html

Besides, 1,533 workers departed for Patna, Bihar, from Rohtak railway station in a Shramik Special train.Rohtak deputy commissioner (DC) RS Verma and former minister of state for cooperatives Manish Grover interacted with the workers and distributed food, masks, sanitisers and water bottles among them.Kishan, a migrant worker from Patna, said, “I have been coming to Haryana every year to harvest wheat crop, but this time we did not get work due to the coronavirus outbreak.”“Now, I am feeling homesick and am desperate to return to Patna. Haryana is safe but we can’t continue staying in shelter homes as mercury is soaring,” the worker added.Radhe Shyam, a migrant from Bulandshahr, said that he had come to Jhajjar four years ago to work as an industrial labourer. “I consider myself fortunate to have got a chance to go back home while a few other workers are still staying in camps.”“The Jhajjar administration had asked us to go for a medical check-up before boarding the bus. I don’t know whether the local administration in UP will ask me to quarantine at home or stay in a hostel,” he added.‘CAN NOW GO HOME IN PRIVATE VEHICLES’Jhajjar DC Jitender Kumar said that they have allowed migrant workers to go home in their own vehicles after getting permission.“The workers will be given movement passes after they apply online and submit their medical fitness certificates to the administration,” Kumar added.YAMUNANAGAR ADMN SENDS 164 MIGRANTS BACK HOME The Yamunanagar administration sent 164 migrants back to their native places by buses and trains on Wednesday.As per details, 113 of them were sent to the Rohtak railway station by bus from where they travelled to their native places in Bihar.

13-05-2020||Mumbai||Give details of PPE sellers, HC tells Navi Mum civic body||The Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday directed the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) to give details of the companies and prices at which the civic body had purchased personal protective equipment (PPE) and hand sanitisers and how often they were being replenished in a bid to contain the Covid-19.The court was further informed that due to the callous approach of the officers of the corporations many workers had contracted the virus and had to be quarantined, hence directions should be issued to the corporation.The single bench of justice S J Kathawalla, while hearing a petition filed by the Samaj Samata Kaamgar Sangh through video conferencing, was informed by advocate Bhavesh Parmar that the grievances of around 6,277 employees was represented by the petition. Parmar submitted that around 3,261 workers were involved in solid waste management and day-to-day road cleaning and were doing so with their bare hands. The workers were not provided enough water to clean their hands and in the name of hand sanitizers were given two-three drops before and after completing their duty.The bench was further informed that though the workers were reporting to their jobs regularly, they were not provided with any protection from Covid-19 virus such as hand sanitizers, hand gloves, face masks, PPEs etc on a regular basis. They were provided with low-quality face masks and hand gloves on one occasion. As a result of this, there were few positive cases among the workers while over 24 persons were placed under home quarantine and at quarantine centres. The advocate for the corporation, however, refuted the allegations and said that all personal protective equipment including hand gloves, face masks and hand sanitizers were being provided from time to time to all the workers. However, when asked as to when the protective equipment was last provided to the workers the advocate could not respond.The court then directed the corporation to file an affidavit setting out the number of face masks, hand gloves, hand sanitizers which were in their possession prior to the lockdown, the subsequent additions to that, along with the detailed breakup of the distribution carried out from time to time till date. The court also sought the names and addresses of the individuals/firms/companies from whom the hand gloves, sanitizers, face masks, etc were purchased and at what price. The corporation was also asked to disclose on oath, how often the face masks, sanitizers and gloves etc provided to the workers were replaced/replenished and posted for further hearing on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/give-details-of-ppe-sellers-hc-tells-navi-mum-civic-body/story-4ZZzXahMDDCXOtFZGfJVsL.html
13-05-2020||Gurugram||3,000 migrants leave for home in two trains||Under strict supervision and tight security arrangements, the district administration on Wednesday sent 3,000 migrants to Bihar and Madhya Pradesh from the Gurugram railway station in two special shramik trains.Relieved to finally leave for home, the migrants—men, women, children and the elderly—boarded the trains while following social distancing norms at the station under the supervision of the local police, the government railway police (GRP) and civil defence volunteers, officials said.Hitesh Sharma, the sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Badshahpur, said that the exercise—including the registration of migrants, getting them to assemble in a centralised place, ferrying them in buses, making food packets for them for their journey, making security arrangements during their bus journey within the city, as well as at and around the railway station—involved the manpower of more than 500 personnel, including the local police, the GRP and the civil defence volunteers.The police secured the railway station and the area around it and did not allow even the media to enter the station premises.“This was done to make sure there is no unruly incident and no crowd gathers at the station. There are densely populated areas around the station and anybody can enter the station and board the train; we had to maintain law and order,” Sharma said, adding that the migrants’ first train for Tikamgarh left at 10.30am—one-and-a-half hours behind its scheduled time at 9.00am—with 1,400 migrants on board.The second train left at 12.30pm for Madhubani in Bihar with 1,600 migrants.Locals told Hindustan Times they had never witnessed such tight security around the railway station before. SK Singh, a resident of Rajendra Park, said, “Our locality is adjoining the railway station. We were told the GRP personnel were deployed to enhance security.”The Haryana government, however, has been discouraging the migrants who have been living here for years from going back to their hometowns, assuring them that activities in industries and other areas are slowly reopening in the city and their jobs are safe.“Ram Bihari, a daily wage earner who hails from Jhansi, told us that he did not earn a single penny since the imposition of the lockdown. He was unable to feed his family and he saw no scope of earning in the current scenario. He told us he would return to Gurugram later,” an official who was part of the team that saw off the migrants at the railway station said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/3-000-migrants-leave-for-home-in-two-trains/story-cYdyrU5mZ3BqTQ43QibeoO.html
13-05-2020||Gurugram||Sharpshooter of Ashok Rathi gang arrested for having rival killed||The city police on Wednesday arrested the suspected sharpshooter of a gang for allegedly ordering the murder of a rival gangster in Naurangpur village near Kherki Daula on Monday morning.Thirty-five-year-old Dhiraj Yadav, suspected of ordering the hit, is allegedly part of the Ashok Rathi gang. The police said he sent three of his associates to kill the victim, identified as one Manjeet Yadav, while he was at a park with his children. Manjeet sustained at least 14 gunshot wounds in the chest, abdomen, head and leg, the police said.Preet Pal Sangwan, the assistant commissioner of police (crime), said Dhiraj, a resident of Nakhrola village in Manesar area, was arrested from Iffco Chowk around 4.00pm on Wednesday for allegedly conspiring to murder Manjeet from Shikohpur. “He had visited the park in his village with his two children, who were playing nearby when he was shot dead,” the police said.However, his children escaped unhurt as they were in a separate area of the park at the time of the incident,” he said.A crime team was formed on Monday evening, which tracked Dhiraj’s location and followed him on Wednesday. He had got down from a car at Iffco Chowk when the police arrested him.The police said they received a tip that the vehicle used in the crime was used by the suspect a few days ago. The police started surveilling his phone number and scanned his call details and location records.The police recovered a 7.65mm countrymade pistol and 12 live cartridges from his possession.The police have now launched a manhunt to nab the other members of the Rathi gang who shot Manjeet dead. They carry a reward of ₹25,000 for information on each of them.During interrogation, the suspected sharpshooter told the police that he and his associates had hatched a conspiracy to kill Manjeet as he had control over newspaper distribution, and the supply of security guards and domestic help to condominiums in the Kherki Daula area and he wanted to take over the business. However, Manjeet would not let anyone enter his jurisdiction, Sangwan said.“The murder took place on Monday morning as Dhiraj wanted to eliminate him and take over all three businesses to resolve his financial crisis,” he said.“The men shot Manjeet 12 times but when he fell to the ground, he was still breathing. One of them noticed and shot him two more times to end his life. Villagers took him to the hospital, but doctors declared him dead on arrival,” Sangwan said.The police said Manjeet and Dhiraj had been rivals for the last decade and were involved in several cases of murder, attempt to murder and extortion.Sangwan said Dhiraj is currently hospitalised in a private hospital in Sector 38 because he complained of chest pain. His condition is fine but he is trying to evade police interrogation, he said.Manjeet was a close aide of deceased gangster Bhudev Singh, alias Bhanwar, who was killed in a shoot-out with the Gurugram police in Manesar in September 2018. After him, his close aides are running the operations and are involved in extorting money from businessmen in the city, the police said.The preliminary probe suggests that Dhiraj and his associates had conducted a recce of Manjeet’s village for 20 days. “Dhiraj had prepared a layout of the park and followed Manjeet for a week. He was waiting for the right opportunity to have him eliminated,” Sangwan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/sharpshooter-of-ashok-rathi-gang-arrested-for-having-rival-killed/story-SjFsSF4D3rGet5EjWAnu2I.html

The large passenger-vehicle transport ship can carry 145 vehicles and 500 passengers at one-go. M2M Ferries Private Limited (MFLP), the operators, is now surveying to understand travel patterns in the coming months.A spokesperson from MFLP said, “A lot has changed since the outbreak and lockdown. While we have seen a rapid increase in travel demand between Mumbai and Alibaug in the last five years, we want to understand what will be the utility in the monsoon.”During the launch, it was estimated that MFLP along with the Mumbai Port Trust (MbPT) and Maharashtra Maritime Board (MMB) will run two services to and from Mandwa for a month initially, which will be increased to six trips, during the monsoon.“We are expecting people to use it for a quick getaway post lockdown. We are also working on our standard-operating-procedures to adhere to social distancing norms,” the spokesperson added.The 19-km sea-route between Mumbai and Mandwa by the ro-ro is covered in an hour instead of four hours taken to cover the 113 km distance by road. The M2M1 ship, which can travel at a speed of 15 knots, arrived from Greece in the city on February 14.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/post-lockdown-ro-ro-operators-re-think-operations-schedule/story-VSVSDsrMQoduhS3JUPDPEK.html
13-05-2020||City||Sohna village donates ₹21 crore to state’s Covid-19 relief fund||Gurugram: Palra village in Sohna, located almost 12 kilometres south of the Gurugram city, has donated ₹21 crore to the Haryana Covid Relief Fund. For the contribution, the village gram panchayat liquidated a portion of the amount which it received after selling a village land to government agency in 2017.This is the highest donation made by any village panchayat in the state, said Ravinder Kumar, a gram panchayat member.Palra village sarpanch Munesh Devi presented a cheque for the amount to chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar at his residence in Chandigarh on Tuesday.“The idea was floated in a gram panchayat meeting in the first week of April. A part of the village land, which falls under the Sohna block, was acquired by Haryana Shahri Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) in July 2017. The gram panchayat at that time received an amount of almost Rs 40 crore which was deposited in different banks as fixed Deposit (FD),” Kumar said , a gram panchayat member, said, who was present at the CM’s residence in Chandigarh on Tuesday.“Twelve of our gram panchayat members were present in Chandigarh to give the cheque to the CM, who hailed us for our contribution,” said Kumar. According to him, they have been utilizing the interest generated from the amount for the development work of the village. “We realised that the panchayat has no dearth of funds to invest in development work. Releasing a certain amount for relief fund would not hamper our functioning,” said Kumar.On April 11, the gram panchayat had submitted the proposal to the Gurugram district administration to liquidate FDs with different banks. “From the deputy commissioner’s office, the proposal was shared with the Haryana cabinet for approval. An approval is needed from the state government to withdraw money using those FDs. On April 21, the gram panchayat was permitted to do so and donate the amount,” said Kumar.Khattar appreciated the initiative by the Palra villagers and said that the government has been receiving good response from panchayats and social organisations, said a statement released by the district administration. The Palra gram panchayat member further said that the villagers wanted to give their contribution especially at a time when the state government is spending money on migrant workers to mitigate their hardships. “At a time when industrialists and different organizations are coming forward to help the state, we thought of doing it too,” said Kumar.Like Palra, a village from Panipat – Bal Jattan– also donated ₹10.5 crore to the state relief fund.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sohna-village-donates-21-crore-to-state-s-covid-19-relief-fund/story-2T6zkjXtSvoqfGlGdy6SsI.html

Residents of sectors 21 and 22 wrote to the police on Wednesday, asking them to curtail the movement of pedestrians, cyclists and bikers from Delhi, who are entering the city through their residential areas.“We wrote to the police on Wednesday requesting them to stop such movement of people till the situation becomes normal and borders de-sealed. Residents in our sector are worried as coronavirus cases in Delhi are increasing and this has caused an increase of cases in Gurugram also, due to which the Haryana government ordered police to seal all border and roads for movement, except essential services,” said Shahipal Yadav, the president of the Sector 21 residents’ welfare association (RWA).The police sealed all Gurugram-Delhi borders on May 1. “Borders at Bijwasan, Kapashera, Sarhaul and MG Road have all been sealed. Thousands of workers live in Delhi villages adjoining Gurugram’s industrial hub of Udyog Vihar. Many factories and constructions have resumed operations and these workers have no way to reach these sites or units but to use the Salapur route,” said Bhim Singh, the president of Sector 22 RWA.Police put barricades and deployed four police personnel at Salapur border after the restriction was imposed on movement.Naresh Kumar, a resident, whose house is on the Gurugram side at the border, said, “I have shot many videos and clicked many pictures of frequent movement of pedestrians, cyclists and bikers — the rush can be seen in morning and evening. The police hardly stop them. We have raised complaints with these videos and pictures on Twitter tagging all top officials and chief minister office also.”Rajender Kumar, station house officer, Palam Vihar, said, “We have deployed adequate police at Salapur border and movement is restricted. However, I will look into the residents’ complaints.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/residents-allege-cross-border-movement-from-delhi-at-salarpur-seek-stricter-vigil/story-mJjAOST4DXpvyyGqqhEouJ.html

Last year, the civic body had started these operations in mid-July. The officials have created a beat system where areas in all 35 wards would be covered in a three-week period from May 11-31. They said the monthly roster will subsequently be updated and then altered to include those areas which were not covered in the three-week period, to ensure all parts of the city are covered before monsoons arrive.MCG commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh said that with health officials already stretched in dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic, the civic body decided to advance its measures against vector-borne diseases to ensure minimal cases of dengue and malaria are reported, .“We have initiated pre-emptive measures to ensure diseases caused through mosquitoes are kept at a minimum level. Our focus remains on limiting the spread of coronavirus outbreak, and ensure there are no other diseases or ailments which make matters even more complicated,” said Singh.As per the MCG officials, over 80 workers will be carrying out fumigation and anti-larval operations with hand-held machines for fogging, as well as adding chemical insecticides into water bodies or large catchment of stagnant water to kill larvae. The officials said that the unseasonal spell of rains over the past two weeks is also one of the major reasons to start the operations earlier than usual.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mcg-starts-anti-larval-ops-fumigation-in-all-35-wards/story-keIHHKJlNOtpjs0wfpSxzL.html
13-05-2020||Mumbai||Exclude 15% of Western Ghats ESA for mining, industries: State requests Centre||The state will request the Centre to exclude 15% of the area proposed as eco-sensitive area (ESA) in the Western Ghats, in Maharashtra, to allow mining and industrial activity.The proposal will be made today during a meeting with the Union environment ministry, which is expected to decide on the matter at the same meeting. On Monday, during a meeting chaired by state forest minister Sanjay Rathore with senior forest officials, it was decided the state would request the Union environment ministry to exclude 15%, or 17 villages, from the final ESA notification, said Jeet Singh, additional principal chief conservator of forest, Maharashtra forest department. “This was proposed based on suggestions received from the state’s industries department and mining bodies as the draft ESA extends into some villages falling within mining and Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) areas,” said Singh. He said the state would modify its final response to the draft ESA on the basis of the Centre’s response.Declaring an ESA imposes restrictions on setting up projects such as mining, quarrying, thermal power plants, industrial units and construction in the area. On October 3, 2019, the Union environment ministry had proposed a draft of the ESA in the Western Ghats — 56,825 square kilometres (sqkm) spanning six states and covering 37% of the Western Ghats — of which 17,340 sqkm (2,133 villages) were in Maharashtra. So far, the state forest department has excluded 358 of the 2,133 villages from the ESA.A senior forest official, requesting anonymity, said among the villages planned for exclusion are those in the Dodamarg-Sawantwadi forests, an important elephant and tiger corridor along the Maharashtra-Goa border. The wildlife corridor, home to tigers, leopards, elephants, sloth bears, migratory bird species and the Indian giant squirrel (Maharashtra’s state animal) connects the Radhanagari Wildlife Sanctuary in Kolhapur in Maharashtra to Bhimgad Wildlife Sanctuary in Karnataka. The villages will be opened up to mining projects. Ecologist Madhav Gadgil, who headed the Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel formed by the Ministry of Environment and Forests in 2010, said, “There is a much larger area that needs to be protected comprising origins of rivers and major water courses. They have all been traditionally protected. We are witnessing an era of complete destruction of nature to fill the pockets of a small number of people, which is leading to an increase in the economic disparities. Exclusion of 2,500 plus sqkm will certainly lead to social unrest for local communities for these villages.”Kanchi Kohli, an environmental governance expert with Delhi-based Centre for Policy Research said, “From the very beginning ESAs are being declared without taking the local situation into account or holding any public consultations. A decision to keep such areas in or outside protected zones needs to be a much more widespread exercise rather than a decision between state and Central governments alone.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/exclude-15-of-western-ghats-esa-for-mining-industries-state-requests-centre/story-PrnMTA9DyE4pUQXSnyyiIM.html
13-05-2020||City||Covid impact: Staff at Ludhiana hospital go on strike against pay cut||Over 50 paramedical staff of Mohandai Oswal Hospital, near Sherpur Chowk, went on a strike on Wednesday to protest against pay cut. As employees received their salary slips in morning, they confronted the hospital management leading to heated arguments. Following this, the nursing staff and other employees gathered outside the hospital in protest, ignoring need for social distancing.They said their pay was deducted without prior notice, and salaries of some nurses were also not paid in lieu absence. Last month the hospital management had sent the staff on five-day holiday to control the spread of Covid-19, they said. But now, the hospital had not paid them for those five days, and for unavailed leaves.“Majority of the nurses draw a monthly salary of ₹12,000, of which ₹5,000 has been deducted. The management says that the cut has been imposed due to the financial crisis caused by the Covid-19 lockdown,” said one of the protesters.“When we raised objections, the management misbehaved with us. How are we supposed to run our households? We are already doing a crucial duty and handling suspected patients. To top it all, we have been subjected to such an unfair treatment,” another protester said.Repeated calls and messages failed to evoke any response from Yogendra Awadhya, head operations of the hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-impact-staff-at-ludhiana-hospital-go-on-strike-against-pay-cut/story-WhjguAfAHLehyAwZJJ7KPK.html

The government claimed that the drive has now become the largest financial assistance scheme in the country in the transport sector. In the second week of April, the Delhi government decided to provide one-time financial help of ₹5,000 to drivers of autos, taxis, e-rickshaws and other para transit vehicles to help them tide over the financial crisis caused by coronavirus pandemic.Transport minister Kailash Gahlot said this was possible only after his teams decided to leverage technology so that no person needed to step out of their homes and stand in a queue.“The government has paid a total amount of ₹55,04,65,000. To do this without requiring beneficiaries to leave their homes during lockdown, we developed a unique mobile-based technology and software, and leveraged Aadhaar-based direct benefits transfer (DBT),” he said.“We witnessed that in around 60,000 cases there was a mismatch in names between driving licence and Aadhaar. So, we faced a lot of issues in their verification. All the 13 MLOs were directed to manually cross-check and verify the names and details in the driving license with the Aadhaar details. This way, through mobile technology and round the clock efforts of the Delhi transport department officials, the verification process was completed. We have received nearly 158,000 applications,” Gahlot said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/over-110-000-auto-taxi-drivers-paid-rs5-000-each-as-aid-by-delhi-govt/story-2KGt1JiFAGYFzDUuOyGODM.html

13-05-2020||Chandigarh||Deadlock over chief secy deepens as Cong leaders press for probe||A day after Punjab chief secretary Karan Avtar Singh was relieved of the additional charge of financial commissioner, taxation, the stalemate between the ruling Congress leaders and the state government on Wednesday deepened with several of them demanding a probe into revenue losses in the excise department in the past three years.State cooperation and jails minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa and Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar were among those who backed the demand for immediate removal of Karan Avtar, a 1984-batch IAS officer, from the post of chief secretary besides an inquiry into the decisions taken by the excise department.Besides the two, Congress MLAs Amrinder Singh Raja Warring, Raj Kumar Verka, Joginder Pal, Balwinder Singh Laddi, Sangat Singh Gilzian, Barinder Singh Pahra, Fatehjang Singh Bajwa and Kulbir Singh Zira also pressed for the demands.The logjam was triggered by a showdown between the chief secretary, who also held the charge of financial commissioner, taxation, and two ministers — Manpreet Singh Badal (finance) and Charanjit Singh Channi (technical education) at a pre-cabinet meeting last week over some changes in the state excise policy to provide relief to liquor contractors for the lockdown period. The ministers expressed reservations over the proposed changes and stormed out of the meeting, objecting to the chief secretary’s demeanour.At Monday’s cabinet meeting, they demanded Karan Avtar’s removal with some other party leaders alleging that he had “conflict of interest”, seeking a probe into revenue losses in the last three years. Even as Amarinder relieved the chief secretary of the additional charge of financial commissioner, taxation, after his showdown with some ministers and Warring’s allegations that the officer’s son had business interests in liquor trade, the move failed to placate the party leaders. Warring, who had thanked Amarinder for relieving thee officer of the additional charge, was the first one to demand an inquiry against him on Wednesday for revenue losses of Rs 600 crore in the excise department. “..kindly remove him from his post of chief secretary so that he is unable to influence the enquiry,” he posted on Twitter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/deadlock-over-chief-secy-deepens-as-cong-leaders-press-for-probe/story-4VbZ7jheVYhPcl80zBoXOJ.html
13-05-2020||Chandigarh||Liquor loot on in Punjab: Majithia||Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader and former state minister Bikram Singh Majithia on Wednesday alleged that the Congress government in Punjab was in a state of open gang-warfare among leaders of the liquor mafia, holding high offices in the government.“This is virtually bootleggers’ liquor lust and loot out in the open. It is shocking that while people are fighting for their lives, ministers and other Congressmen are losing their sleep not over finding solutions to their problems, but only over their share in liquor loot,” a statement from Majithia said.Referring to the ongoing tussle between the ministers and the chief secretary in the state, Majithia added it was unprecedented that ministers had been accused of running massive illicit liquor cartels, by their own head of the civil service.“The ministers must either resign immediately on moral grounds or be summarily dismissed on corruption charges,” he claimed, alleging that the ministers seemed to have launched a counter-attack on senior bureaucrats only to deflect public attention from the allegations of liquor loot. “The ministers want to put the chief secretary on the defensive through political blackmail and public calumny. However, if there is substance in the allegations of either the chief secretary or the ministers, then the government must dare to act, and file and FIR against whichever side is prima facie guilty,” he said.He added, “If the ministers have any principles, then instead of refusing to sit in cabinet meetings with the officer, they should show moral daring and resign from the cabinet, unless he is removed. They, however, won’t take this principled stand.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/liquor-loot-on-in-punjab-majithia/story-0bZWBa14jhLTTKNVJbQnMO.html
13-05-2020||Delhi||Police to organise conference calls with doctors for their personnel and families||After issuing a standard operating procedure (SOP) for the daily health monitoring of their personnel to ensure timely prevention and protection from the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), the Delhi Police on Tuesday took an initiative to launch a tele-advice initiative, through which personnel or their relatives will be put in direct contact with a doctor for medical advice. According to the police, doctors from government and private hospitals in every district have volunteered for this initiative. “As per this system, the station house officers (SHOs) and unit heads will maintain a panel with names of doctors who have offered their services,” a senior police officer said.“If any police personnel or his/her relative has any health concerns, the SHO and the unit head will connect them on a conference call with the doctor. This round-the-clock facility will ensure that the police personnel and their families have access to medical advice at all times,” the officer said. This will also reduce the need for testing and hospitalisation in cases in which it is not really needed, the officer said. Anil Mittal, additional PRO of Delhi Police, said that the initiative will help reduce anxiety and fear psychosis among the personnel. “Each district police station now has access to a list of doctors in its area. In case of even minor symptoms, the police will be able to receive timely guidance. In these extraordinary times, anxiety and stress could be more dangerous than the actual infection itself. The initiative will help deal with that,” Mittal said. So far, one policeman has succumbed to the virus and at least 125 Delhi Police personnel have been infected, said an officer aware of the matter, who didn’t want to be named. Earlier, the police had issued an SOP for monitoring the health of its personnel. As per the SOP, any police personnel feeling unwell, suffering from cough, sore throat, fever, breathlessness or any other symptom “must immediately report” the same to the duty officer (DO) of the police station or unit where they are posted “by any means of communication”.At the district level, the police are taking additional steps to ensure that their personnel are not infected. While health registers, masks and sanitiser at police stations are a must, in the south Delhi district, the police have begun an ‘Ayu Raksha Rath’, a vehicle that will take rounds of all police pickets in the district every day. “The staff in the vehicle will distribute Vitamin C tablets and Ayurvedic products to all staffers deployed at the pickets,” Atul Kumar Thakur, deputy commissioner of police (south), said.Earlier, last week, the Delhi Police commissioner, SN Shrivastava, in a video conference with reporters, had told HT in response to a question about the police’s preparedness in case of a large number of their personnel tested positive, that at least 15% of the staff had been kept on standby.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/police-to-organise-conference-calls-with-doctors-for-their-personnel-and-families/story-jHS9fY814WhEry820crk0K.html
13-05-2020||Delhi||Caretakers of persons with disabilities are exempt from lockdown restrictions: Centre to HC||The Centre on Wednesday informed the Delhi High Court that caretakers of persons with disabilities should be allowed to reach them “by exempting them from restrictions during lockdown or providing [them] passes in a simplified manner on priority”. The information was given to Justice V Kameswar Rao after he had posted a query to the Centre seeking to know whether caretakers of such persons are exempted from the restrictions. The Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, in response, told the court that on March 26, it had issued detailed guidelines to provide better facilities to persons with disabilities.In an affidavit, the Central government’s standing counsel Anurag Ahluwalia told the court that the guidelines covered various aspects. The guidelines stated that all information concerning the Covid-19 pandemic should be available in a simple, local language in accessible formats, including Braille and audio, for persons with audio/visual impairment.The guidelines also stated that all emergency service providers should be trained to deal with persons with disability (PwDs) in the right way and on the risk associated with additional problems for persons with specific impairments. It also said that online counselling sessions should be provided for the PwDs to help them de-stress.The court was hearing a plea by Varun Khullar, a disabled person and a DJ and music producer, who had sought directions to the Centre to classify caretakers, attendants and support staff of persons with disabilities as medical personnel and consequently grant them exemptions under the National Disaster Management Act, including but not limited to, their transit.The plea filed through advocates Karan Mathur and Ivo D’Costa had contended that the petitioner was suffering from 100% disability and, accordingly, could not perform his day-to-day functions without the help of a caretaker/attendant.It also highlighted an April 24 report by Hindustan Times which mentioned the various problems faced by disabled persons due to the lockdown and the absence of caretakers.Following such submissions, the court disposed of the matter even though it did not pass any order on the resumption of public transport for caretakers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/caretakers-of-persons-with-disabilities-are-exempt-from-lockdown-restrictions-centre-to-hc/story-ASD7XYlQOjMGuPQgiNhU7J.html
13-05-2020||City||North MCD unveils new property tax interface on its portal||New Delhi: The North Delhi Municipal Corporation on Wednesday unveiled a new interface on its portal for citizens to file their property taxes.This new section (https://mcdonline.nic.in/citizenndmc/web/citizen/info) is user-friendly and is aimed at getting more residents to file their taxes online at a time when people can’t step out due to the lockdown, officials said. Property tax is the largest source of revenue for the corporations followed by toll tax, parking, advertisement and renting out community halls. In the last financial year (2019-20), the north corporation earned Rs. 1,118 crore in property tax, which was almost 45% of its total income of Rs. 2,485 crore. Officials said 4.68 lakh houses have already been enrolled in the UPIC (Unique Property Identification Card) system and brought under the tax net.“We have estimated our lost property tax this year, attributable to Covid, to about Rs. 180 crore. In fact, the largest amount of property tax comes to us at the end of the year as a lot of people wait for March, but this time the lockdown coincided with that,” said north corporation commissioner, Varsha Joshi. Naina Soin Kapil, additional commissioner (revenue) with the corporation, their earlier portal was handled by a private company, whose contract with us ended in December 2019. “Now, our website is designed and operated by a government agency, National Informatics Centre (NIC). The entire data is now cloud-based and hosted at NIC’s Bhubaneswar data centre with back-up in Pune. So we are 100% data secure,” she said.“We have incorporated several new user-friendly features. For example, visitors can now file their property tax dues for the previous years as well, while on the earlier website, you could do it only for the current year. They can see their entire payment history over the years on the new portal,” she said.The north corporation has suspended all submissions through cheques and cash.“We are creating provisions for each resident under our geographical jurisdiction to be able to create his or her own unique log-in through his or her Unique Property Identification Card (UPIC) and uploading details of their payments not just regarding property tax but various licences as well. So this will become a one-stop centre for all such details a resident is looking for,” Naina said.“Besides, we will keep updating revisions in property rates on the portals for people to be able to calculate their dues correctly,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/north-mcd-unveils-new-property-tax-interface-on-its-portal/story-Aw4YOFjl45rnGMQTTKE44N.html

Moving forward, it completed the next set of 10,000 tests in just 5 days, crossing the 30,000-mark by May 7.”The state, he said, plans to commence testing at four state government labs -- Regional Disease Diagnostic Laboratory, Jalandhar; Guru Angad Dev Veterinary and Animal Sciences University, Ludhiana; Punjab Biotech Incubator, Mohali; and State Forensic Science Laboratory, Mohali.Besides, labs are also being set up at four central government institutions -- Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Mohali; National Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research (NIPER), Mohali; National Agri-Food Biotechnology Institute (NABI); and Panjab University, Chandigarh, he added.Sidhu said a proposal has also been sent to the Centre by the health department to set up four new labs in the district hospitals at Barnala, Rupnagar, Ludhiana and Hoshiarpur.“Government labs are also going in for pool testing in low prevalence areas to enhance the testing capacity in the state. So far, approximately 7,435 pool tests have been conducted in the state,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/at-1-392-punjab-s-testing-per-million-better-than-national-average-sidhu/story-mq88aAymcdVW9fQupq8cOM.html
13-05-2020||City||Lockdown, increased western disturbances may have led to cooler start to summer in Delhi||New Delhi Delhi is experiencing an unusually cool summer this year. Compared to the average temperature recorded in the national capital since 1980 between March and May, the city’s average temperature has been three to six degrees lower this year in the same period, researchers observed.Limited industrial and commercial activities and vehicular movement because of the nationwide lockdown, along with an increased number of western disturbances this year, could be the reasons behind this change, environment experts said. Two researchers, Mudit Kapoor, an associate professor of economics at the Indian Statistical Institute (Delhi Unit), and Shamika Ravi, a senior fellow at Brookings Institute, compared Delhi’s average daily temperature from 1980 to 2017 and marked the deviation against 2018, 2019 and 2020. The researchers observed that this year, between March and May 5, the temperature was three to six degrees lower than the average.“We compared the temperatures of Delhi, Ahmadabad, Bengaluru, Chennai, Kolkata, Mumbai and Lucknow via a visual presentation. We marked the average temperature of a particular day based on data from 1980 to 2017. We marked any recording above this average in red and any recording below this average in blue for the years 2018, 2019 and 2020,” Kapoor said.He said, “In Delhi, April 2019, was very hot compared to the average April, but April 2020 is much cooler.”While the researchers have only made these observations, and are yet to come up with an analysis of the reasons behind the variation in temperature, they are not ruling out the effect of the 49-day nationwide lockdown to control the Covid-19 pandemic, which has restricted industrial and commercial activities in the city and limited vehicular movement on roads.“It has been an unusual year. Compared to the average temperature (from 1980 to 2017) in Delhi, this year’s lower temperatures so far are an anomaly. This might be because of the lockdown,” Ravi said. Experts are divided over the reasons behind the dip in temperatures in the city. Some credit the increased number of western disturbances that brought intermittent wet spells through March, April and even the first week of May for the comparatively low temperature. Others are not ruling out the possibility of lower pollution levels in the Capital.Scientists at the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said Delhi received six WDs in March and six in April, which is unlikely for these months. This trend, however, began from January, when nine WDs passed Delhi, and seven crossed in February.On May 10, thunderstorm and light rain in certain parts of Delhi-NCR also brought down the temperature. The IMD forecast has predicted cloudy weather for the week, with maximum temperature hovering between 34 degrees Celsius and 39 degrees Celsius.“There has been an increased effect of WDs in the whole of north-west India, which has kept the temperature in Delhi lower than usual this year. By this time of the year, the normal temperature touches 40 degrees Celsius, but the mercury is yet to rise,” Kuldeep Srivastava, head of the IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said.He added, “We have also noticed that even when it doesn’t rain, clouds hover over the city after the WDs pass, which does not allow the temperature to rise.”In the summer forecast issued in February, the IMD had indicated that the average temperature in Delhi from March to May is likely to be warmer than normal by 0.5-1 degree Celsius.Other experts said that though a proper analysis is yet to prove the connection between the lockdown and the lower temperature levels this time, there is scientific proof that vehicular and industrial emissions add to the heat levels of the city.Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy) at the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), said the pollution levels in Delhi and NCR have remained in the green zone for this duration and its positive impact will surely be visible.“These are such unique circumstances; it is like Earth is in repair mode. We know that emissions from vehicles and industries add to the heat island effect, which increases temperatures in urban centres. It is highly possible that we are benefitting from the restriction in emissions,” Roychowdhury said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lockdown-increased-western-disturbances-may-have-led-to-cooler-start-to-summer-in-delhi/story-wUM5vrXrW7lNGKIfqVAdOJ.html
13-05-2020||Delhi||Rats, termites and waterlogging damage goods as shops keep shutters down for 45 days||Naveen Shankar, a dry fruits trader in Old Delhi’s Khari Baoli, says that when he opened the shutter of his shop on Tuesday to take stock of the situation after nearly 40 days, his jaw dropped in shock. Sealed cans of cashews, walnuts and almonds, imported from across the globe, were strewn on the floor, and white powdery remains were pouring from sacks that had been nibbled into. A few dead rats lay around the shop, taking credit for the damage.He estimates that this loss would nearly be worth ₹50 lakh, and he hasn’t even looked at the condition of his godown yet, where he has stored nearly 250 sacks of various varieties of dry fruits.Rat-nibbled garments, termite-infested paper rolls, fungal growth in eatables and knee-deep water in showrooms and godowns—nearly 45 days after the lockdown, traders in the national capital are bearing the brunt of downing their shutters. Many say that since shops have remained closed for many days now, the losses caused by insect infestation and waterlogging is already estimated to be worth several crores of rupees and this is just the beginning.“Anticipating Ramzan, we had stored high-priced dates, figs (anjeer), cashews, almonds and walnuts. Before we closed our shop, we moved a lot of the items into our godowns. We sealed the stuff in the shop in sacks and airtight cans. But when we opened the shutters to check the situation, we found the shop in a mess,” Shankar says.On March 25, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced a nationwide lockdown to control the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in the country. Only shops selling essential commodities such as groceries, vegetables and medicines could operate. While many trader unions supported the lockdown, as days pass, the losses are proving back-breaking for many small traders.Traders in Old Delhi say that while those in other parts of the city were dealing with problems of rat and insect infestation, they were facing additional challenges unique to this area. Since the area has a higher underground water-level compared to the rest of the city, many basements and godowns are filled with knee-deep water that has damaged clothes, jewellery and stationery items.Paramjeet Singh Pamma, president of Sadar Bazar market association, says that many shops in the market are located below ground level, and because no one could come to inspect the situation in the shops for over a month, the shops are flooded. The recent rain in parts of the national capital has also added to the damage.In many shops, the godowns, which are mostly located behind the shops, have also been flooded or have had rats running amok, destroying the stock. There are nearly 30,000 to 40,000 traders in the market.“On Monday, when the Delhi government announced some relaxations, some of us managed to check on the situation. Many told us of their stock being soaked in water, resulting in a fungal coating on their goods. All of it is unfit for sale now,” Pamma says.Not far from Sadar Bazar, in Chandni Chowk and Chawri Bazar, the situation is similar. Traders dealing in paper and wholesale stationery items have been hit the worst. They say paper rolls have completely been destroyed and cannot be salvaged. The estimated loss in Chawri Bazar, where there are nearly 120 paper traders, is over ₹5-8 crore till now, the Chawri Bazar Paper Traders’ Association says.Apart from the losses incurred from just the damaged goods, traders are also worried that prolonged closure will also add to the costs of redoing their shops, as walls have been coated with algae remains and furniture has been destroyed by termites.Sanjay Bhargava, president of Sarv Vyapar Mandal in Chandni Chowk, says that many traders in the market are unable to reach their shops as their residential areas have been marked as containment zones by the government. The gravity of the situation will unfold in the coming weeks, he says.“I am also a victim. I opened my shop after many days and found dead rats just lying around. Apart from this, traders have also complained of sarees and lehengas being eaten by insects and termites. Silver jewellery and work on wedding wear have also been oxidised. It is a very peculiar situation and we do not know how the government can intervene to help us out,” Bhargava says. Similar scenes have been witnessed in markets across the city. Traders say that this is just the tip of the iceberg because many of them are yet to open their shops and assess the damage caused.In south Delhi’s popular Sarojini Nagar market, traders have written to Prime Minister Modi and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal to allow shops of non-essential goods to open. Showrooms of popular brands in the market have also experienced cases of insect infestations that have damaged goods worth crores in the market.“We have written to the PM and the CM asking them to allow us to open our shops.

On Monday, the CM was authorised by the council of ministers to approve changes in the state excise policy, as demanded by liquor contractors citing losses. The excise and taxation, and finance departments had suggested not to extend period of contract for liquor vends beyond March 31, 2021.Amarinder approved the finance department’s recommendation to provide proportionate adjustment of ‘minimum guarantee quota’ for the losses incurred in the 9 days of lockdown in March (2.5% cut from total revenue quota of Rs 5,675 crore), which comes out to Rs 141 crore. In the current financial year, relaxation of 10% (Rs 620 crore) was approved of a total of Rs 6,200 crore revenue projection.The CM also directed the excise department to complete allotment of vends as per the 2020-21 state excise policy, which he said was approved by the cabinet on January 31.Of a total of 756 groups, 500 were renewed as per the 2019-20 policy while the remaining 256 were restructured into 186 groups of which 89 groups were allotted as per the 2020-21 policy. The remaining 97 groups are yet to be allotted vends.“We were expecting clear-cut announcement today but the entire process has been delayed by bringing in a committee and the group of ministers,” said Sunil Mahajan, a liquor contractor.GoM TO GIVE REPORT ON LEVYING COVID CESS The CM also constituted a group of ministers (GoM) comprising Manpreet Singh Badal (finance), Vijay Inder Singla (education) and Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria (housing & urban development) and mandated it to consider levying special Covid cess on the sale of liquor, as has been done by other states. TRADERS TO DECIDE ON HOME DELIVERY The CM asked the contractors to take call on the issue of home delivery of liquor which has started in Fatehgarh Sahib and Faridkot districts. He said the apex court had suggested home delivery or indirect sale of liquor in its order May 8 to ensure social distancing during the lockdown. Many contractors are opposing the move.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/lockdown-effect-amarinder-sets-up-committee-to-assess-losses-to-liquor-traders/story-UBG92xLy0a2WXyWnOvwjeI.html

The man had divorced his first wife and he had a son from that marriage. The victim and suspect started living together and moved to Greater Noida,” he said.Upadhyaya said that Kumari was demanding some money from Rajput to start her own paying guest facility, and this had led to frequent arguments. “Police investigation showed that Rajput strangled the woman and fled the spot over the same issue,” he said.Police said they found another address of Rajput in Ashok Nagar, New Delhi. A police team visited that address but he could not be found. Police informed Kumari’s parents in Bihar and launched a search to trace her live-in partner and son.Tejveer Bhati, president of the Swarn Nagri Resident Welfare Association said that the couple had moved in six months ago. “On Wednesday, some neighbours noticed the foul smell from the flat and we informed the flat owner,” he said.Police said they have not received a complaint from the victim’s family or relatives yet.

Judges will have access to details of cases, FIR numbers, names of the accused and details of arrest the moment they are uploaded into the system.In reciprocation, the court will be able to send details of remand orders, bail, property release and other information to the police electronically. Police officers will be able to access live update of court proceedings in each case and also orders passed.Justice Chandrachud also said that the next initiative would also include launching of e-seva Kendra in the high court of each state and one district court so that people who are not technology savvy can also avail the e-facilities.Justice Rajiv Shakdher, chairman of the Information and Technology Committee of the Delhi High Court, said more than 732,061 cases have been disposed so far with the help of the virtual court wherein the offenders have paid a fine of Rs 89.54 crore as fine.

And how will they survive without workers who have left in hordes?” questioned the CM, urging the Centre to take note of the woes of labourers, especially in the unorganised sector.The CM said on the face of it, MSMEs have not received a bail-out package from the Union finance minister. Instead, they were being offered loans, which will only end up plunging them into a deeper debt crisis.“Even the MSMEs working in the critical health sector have not received any special incentives to give them the impetus that they need right now to support the covid battle,” Amarinder said, lamenting the “absence of serious thought in prioritising the nation’s needs at this critical juncture.”Pointing out that Punjab had 2.52 lakh industries, of which only 1,000 are large-scale, the CM said given the magnitude of the problem, Centre will need to come out with a huge package for the MSMEs to resume operations. Labourers will return only when MSMEs start operations, he added.The CM hoped that the next set of announcements from the Union finance minister will see some concrete announcements for the unorganised labour sector, in particular, and address unemployment crisis in country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/first-relief-package-shows-no-intent-of-securing-lives-captain/story-swn5IZn7mlgBV350ExTXvL.html

As per central guidelines, the state government has not allowed operation of commercial establishments dealing in non-essential items in these districts – Patiala, Ludhiana and Jalandhar. The traders in red zone areas claim they are suffering huge financial losses not only in terms of income, but their stored goods worth crores of rupees are deteriorating due to the lockdown since March 22.In Patiala, traders on Wednesday held protests in their respective commercial areas against the Centre and the state government for not providing any kind of relief to them. Rakesh Gupta, president of Patiala District Beopar Mandal, said the traders had extended full cooperation to the authorities, but now the lockdown has started taking toll on their businesses as well as patience.“Not only small traders, but big traders and multi-brand stores are facing losses of crores of rupees. The traders are left with no money as they have exhausted available funds for meeting their committed expenditures,” Gupta said. Ludhiana-based Naresh Singla, Punjab chairman of Readymade Garments Markets Association, said the garments lying in their stores have been damaged in bug attack. Termites have eaten up the furniture at their outlets. The fungus has damaged the leather stuff. We have asked the authorities to visit our shops just to see our plight,” said Singla, who also owns a store in Patiala.Singla said the government should allow the traders to open their shops on rotational basis. Abhishek Garg, a cloth merchant in Patiala’s Sher-e-Punjab market, said, “We had stocked up summer stuff worth Rs 40 lakh before the announcement of lockdown, but all of it has gone waste due to covid-19 pandemic.”He added, “Traders have no money to pay salaries to our salesmen, who make frequent rounds to our residences.” Nikhil Bindra, who launched his clothing merchandise in Ludhiana two years ago, said he earned good profit last year, but is now reeling under heavy losses.Meanwhile, Patiala deputy commissioner Kumar Amit said the administration understand the plights of traders is holding consultations with them.“We are following the Centre’s directives while implementing restrictions in red zone areas. We have already put forward our demand before the state government to confine red zone status only to containment areas in the district so that commercial activity can be allowed in other areas,” the DC said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/resentment-brews-among-traders-in-red-zone-districts-in-punjab/story-srBBXEAe6NZNWsHWaojA1I.html

The CPCB has issued guidelines that promote using eco-friendly materials to make and decorate idols.On Wednesday, the CPCB published a revised version of its 10-year-old guidelines, which cover instructions for idol makers; immersions at waterbodies and in the sea; festival organising committees; and the responsibilities of state pollution control boards.Use of pyramid of sugarcane sticks for pandals along with natural clay and natural clay mixed with alum have been suggested for idols by the CPCB. “Idols and decorations made using PoP, plastic and thermocol accessories as well as dyes used to colour these idols, having harmful and toxic chemicals are banned for future use,” said Prashant Gargava, member secretary, CPCB. This decision is to aimed at tackling the environmental impact of idols and their immersion. Gargava said state pollution control boards have been directed to take a call on suitable penalties for illegal use of banned materials.The Brihanmumbai Ganesh Murtikar Sang, an association with over 700 idol makers in Mumbai, said it was opposed to the new guidelines. “Over 500 of our idol makers use PoP. It takes a minimum of 22 days to make the smallest clay idols and six months to complete large idols. During lockdown with restrictions on movement of non-essential goods, how will we manage to get large quantity of clay before this year’s festival?” said Gajanan Tondwalkar, president of the association. He said adhering to these guidelines could lead to almost 5 lakh artisans losing their livelihoods. “We will challenge the Centre’s decision before courts and submit our reservations to the Maharashtra government,” said Tondwalkar.According to the Brihanmumbai Samanvay Ganeshotsav Sarvajanik Samiti (BSGSS), the umbrella body of Ganesh mandals in the city, an average of 11,000 large (sarvajanik) idols and 1.6 lakh household idols are made every year using PoP. The use of thermocol and plastic was disallowed by BSGSS last year. An average of 75 large idols and 40,000 household idols are made using clay while 250 paper idols are made annually during the 11-day Ganeshotsav festival, which will take place in August this year.Naresh Dahibhavkar, president, BSGSS said, “Less than 5% of the total idols in 2019 were eco-friendly. If concerns of Covid-19 affecting this year’s festival were not enough, the latest guidelines will ensure none of the pandals have any idols this year. We request the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board to intervene and issue some relaxations.” Lalbaugcha Raja, Mumbai Cha Raja Ganesh Galli, Andhericharaja, Fortcha Icchapurti and many other popular mandals have been using PoP to make their idols for almost a decade.Other guidelines issued by the CPCB require groups of craftsmen making over 100 idols to be registered with urban local bodies and state pollution control boards, which will grant fresh permits to artisans. “Under the new norms, only registered idol makers will be allowed and all previous permits stand cancelled,” said Gargava.Idols must be immersed in artificial ponds but in case there is no option to their immersion in rivers, lakes or ponds, a designated location with shallow depth needs to be identified by local authorities. For immersions at sea, idols will be immersed between the high tide and low tide line at designated sites defined by the state’s coastal authority. The waste generated by the idol’s immersion must be collected and disposed of safely by the local civic body within 24 hours.According to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, last year 2.11 lakh idols were immersed across 129 immersion spots in Mumbai. The figure was 2.03 lakh in 2018; 1.92 lakh in 2017; and 2.09 lakh in 2016. Dahibhavkar estimates that percentage of eco-friendly idols increase from 2% to 5% over four years with a maximum increase in paper idols being adopted by mandals.“The Centre should have issued a buffer period before publishing the guidelines. It will affect festivities this year, but we will see how best they can be implemented by consulting local bodies and the state government,” said Swapnil Parab, secretary, Ganesh Galli Mandal (Mumbai Cha Raja).THE MATHS OF IMMERSIONPoP contains chemicals such as sulphur, phosphorus and magnesium and is the cheapest and least labour-intensive material for idols. PoP idols are priced between Rs 500 to Rs 1,000, depending on the size of the idol. However PoP takes months to completely dissolve in water. Dyes currently used to colour idols usually contain mercury, cadmium, arsenic, lead, and carbon — all of which are harmful for aquatic biodiversity.Clay idols take two to three weeks to dissolve in water and are more expensive than PoP. For example, an 18kg clay idol costs Rs. 5000, according to Mumbai-based idol makers.Idols are also made out of paper and glue, or a combination of paper, flour and water. The latter is the most expensive material for idols and dissolves the fastest when immersed in water. ‘Natural’ idols — made from a combination of corn powder and spinach powder; and painted with natural colours derived from ingredients like turmeric, sandalwood (chandan) and ochre (geru) — dissolve in water within four to five hours. The cost of a nine-inch natural idol would be Rs 900.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cpcb-bans-use-of-pop-thermocol-plastic-for-idol-making-sets-revised-guidelines-for-immersion/story-n1012DUheqN3WZakNJ4AtK.html

Around 70% of these pony owners have no land or are migrants with no other source of income.”He said the rising cost of feed and maintenance of the animals was an additional financial burden on them. “The cost of whole gram (chana) on which these ponies and horses survive is over ₹150/kg and the average cost to maintain a horse was no less than ₹600-700 a day. Also, we have to pay ₹100 every month for the sanitation and maintenance of the tourist spot,” he said.A horse owner, who didn’t wish to be named, said, “All my savings have been exhausted, and I am unable to take care of the two horses I own. So I am going to sell one of them, but due to the pandemic, no one is ready to buy it either.”Geeta Ram, who has been in the profession for 15 years now, said, “This is the peak season for us. For the past many years, I have been taking online booking as well. But this year, all the bookings got cancelled due to the lockdown. Small businesses like ours go unnoticed by the government.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-joy-rides-for-500-pony-owners-as-lockdown-ceases-tourist-activity-in-kufri/story-1UWSRk1mha0wiWXtYHu0cJ.html

Small shopkeepers should also be granted relief in commercial rates of electricity.”“The state government has already done injustice by cutting salaries and dearness allowance (DA) of middle class employees. This is a time to provide relief to the people, not to make cuts in it,” he added.He alleged that the state had disappointed farmers and horticulturists, who are the backbone of Himachal’s economy, by not granting any relief package to them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/congress-demands-rollback-of-himachal-s-decision-to-cut-ration-of-middle-class-by-50/story-3V8fKU1qkm3YRVVDz5KGkJ.html

The fruit that was lying in cold stores was a concern and now about 1,450 trucks have left for Delhi and other terminal markets,” said Kashmir industries and commerce director Mehmood Ahmad Shah. “There are around 31 cold stores housing about 25,000 MT of apple, which would be gradually exported to fruit markets till the mid of June,” he added.Regulating the supply of fruit produce to terminal markets is bound to fetch remunerative prices for the dealers as there were concerns that due to extended lockdown, the apples would have to be sold locally at throwaway prices. This holds promise for future of cold storage industry in Kashmir, which would benefit the growers and dealers alike as the problem of glut in the apple market can be averted by regulating supply to the terminal markets.“About 80 packaging units manufacturing cardboard boxes are also functional. By allowing cold stores and cardboard units to resume operations, the fruit crop would get the much needed packaging and marketing support. In the next 10 to 15 days, cherry season is going to start. Both cold stores and packaging units shall cater to the cherry crop and benefit the growers and fruit dealers. Since the shelf life of cherry is very short, this year more emphasis will be on canning of the produce,” the industries director said.Since August 5, the day of abrogation of Article 370, the fruit growers here have suffered huge losses as they could not dispatch their produce on time. Many of these growers had dumped the fruit in cold stores with a hope to supply the same in April to earn profit. However, the lockdown had again put the growers in distress with many making appeals to local people to buy the produce. “With the resumed supply, the rates have also gone up, which is an encouraging sign,” said a cold store owner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kashmir-apple-industry-gets-impetus-as-admn-starts-supply-of-cold-storage-produce/story-DBjZIz0Ne1wlCy0PrMMIcO.html

The applicant claimed that the raid was carried out when his shop was shut. A gratification of ₹2 lakh was also sought from him by the raiding officials. In light of the allegations, the court held that there was no need for custodial interrogation and granted pre-arrest bail and posted the matter for July 7.The single bench of justice Sadhana Jadhav while hearing the application of Ubaidur Rahman Shaikh a resident of Jogeshwari through video conference that Shaikh’s brother owned a shop on S V Road and he lived on the first floor above the shop.

We are trying to bring things back on track,” Samoon added. Another official said the department was planning to take a call on skipping morning assembly and holding shift-wise classes. “A decision in this regard will be out soon,” he said.The decision to reopen schools has been taken in view of interruptions caused during online classes due to the poor internet speed, the official said.In his recent meeting with education officials, J&K Lieutenant Governor G C Murmu directed them to review the department’s functioning and the conduct of online classes, besides distribution of dry ration for midday meals among schoolchildren.Following the LGs directions, an official communiqué was also sent to the UT school education director stating that all government school buildings should be whitewashed before their opening.Samoon on Wednesday urged all private schools to defer fee collections from students. “It is a tough times for the parents and students,” he said.“We have distributed 60,000 books and 1,200 educational tablets among the students not having access to mobile phones,” he said adding, “It is being done to enhance their virtual learning experience.”Mushtaq Ahmad, a parent from Baramulla district, said it was not the right time to open schools. “This will put the lives of our children at risk,” he said.Kashmir private schools association president G N Var opined that schools should be reopened in the valley. “One is not sure how long will the virus scare continue, but we can’t see more academic loss of students. We have suffered it in past as well,” he said.“Social distancing will be maintained, sanitisers and masks will be made available to the students for their safety,” Var said.When asked about school fee, Var said, “Depositing fee is mandatory in schools. We can’t skip this option. But an exception can be made for poor students only,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kashmir-education-department-mulls-reopening-of-schools-next-month/story-dIgrxVcmg7PLJqr6YgK2LM.html

According to teachers, 90% students remain absent from online classes, especially in rural areas.A math teacher from Patiala said, “Absence of books and unavailability of phones and internet connection have badly affected the students. Most students of government schools belong to economically weaker backgrounds, and cannot afford mobile phones or books.”“During online classes, hardly 10% students remain present. A student’s presence in online class depends on the availability of their family members’ phones,” he added.Democratic Teachers Front (DTF) member Vikram Dev told HT, “We have demanded reduction in the syllabus for this academic session, keeping in view the grim situation due to Covid-19 pandemic.”On May 10, education department secretary Krishan Kumar had written to all deputy commissioners in the state to allow district education officers to distribute books to students.District education officer (primary) Harinder Kaur said, “The books have reached the block levels and will be distributed to the students soon.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/students-of-govt-schools-in-punjab-yet-to-receive-books-for-new-session/story-cWGx6Rt706rOSaNavvUz6N.html

The easy-to-access map shows users the zones near their locality. One can also access the map on the district administration’s website http://hpkangra.nic.in.According to the Union ministry of health and family welfare guidelines, a containment zone means at least one person from the area has tested positive for Covid-19. The patient’s family and house are identified as a cluster zone, nearby houses, sometimes the entire village or group of villages is mapped in the containment zone, depending on the area’s geography and population density.The containment zones are completely blocked and no movement is allowed for at least two weeks. Essential services are provided through home delivery.“The containment zone strategy is an important and time-tested for limiting the spread of epidemics like COVID-19. The approach is likely to remain in use for quite long,” deputy commissioner Rakesh Kumar Prajapati said.“The new initiatives of the district administration to disseminate information by using IT tools will help spread awareness about the ever-changing containment zones and measures taken to contain the spread of the disease,” he added.Additional deputy commissioner, Raghav Sharma, who leads the team which is developing various IT applications to tackle the spread, said new orders are issued daily in wake of the Covid-19 outbreak but for the common man it is tough to dissect useful information.“IT tools make it easier for public to access such information,” he said, adding that the Google Map linked to the district website shows active containment zones in red colour.“The de-notified containment zones are depicted in green colour. If someone wants to get information about active containment zones, he may access the information by clicking on the red icon. The information about the time period for which the area has been notified as containment zone is also available on the map,” the ADC said.At present, Kangra has six active containment zones.

In many countries, workers are fighting for a six hour shift, but the state government is forcing them to work for 12 hours a day.Due to this decision, about one-third of the employed workforce would be laid off as the shifts will be reduced from three to two times a day, he added.CITU said that the Minimum Wage Act 1948 and Salary Payment Act 1936 have not been implemented in many industries of the state and by increasing working hours, exploitation of labourers and workers will also increase.The union has warned the state government to stop formulating policies favouring industrialists and capitalists, else CITU would launch a labour movement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/trade-union-to-protest-against-12-hour-work-shift-in-himachal-on-may-14/story-vvdORKHlPPWW8s7Op3f5kM.html

13-05-2020||Chandigarh||With mining on halt, construction material becomes dearer||As mining has stopped amid the coronavirus lockdown, construction business is suffering due to inflated prices of construction material and shortage of labour. Those in the construction business say good quality sand from Anandpur Sahib and Pathankot is difficult to come by these days. “Retailers were selling Anandpur sand for Rs 23-25 per cubic foot before the lockdown was imposed but now the prices have inflated to Rs 31-33. Consumers will have to shell Rs 6,000-8000 more per truckload (with a capacity of 1000 cubic feet),” says a businessman. Nowadays, sand from Haryana is being supplied in most parts of Punjab. Supply from Himachal, too, has dried up.Anandpur Sahib sub-divisional magistrate Kanu Garg said approved sites were not permitted to start sand mining. Ropar district mining officer Damanpreet Singh says, “Five sites have been approved in Ropar since the lockdown. They are not operational. The supply of sand has been stopped but it is expected that a decision on the front will be taken soon.” PENDING WORK BEING COMPLETED “We have allowed some crushers to start operation but only to complete their pending work. The matter will be discussed with the Ropar deputy commissioner,” he said. Nabha-based sand wholesaler Gurmeet Singh says, “There has been a rise in the price of the sand as mining license holders are charging a huge sum at places where mining activity has been allowed.”Cement companies have also raised their prices. “Earlier, cement companies were selling a 50kg cement bag for Rs 360 but now they are being sold for Rs 380-400 in different parts of Patiala,” says a buisenessman.Iron bar prices have also gone up from Rs 43/kg to Rs 46/kg, as reported in retail markets. Brick prices have risen from Rs 5,000 to 5,700 per 1,000 units.CUSTOMERS POSTPONE CONSTRUCTION A Nabha-based retailer of building material Bachan Singh says, “Being granted permission to open outlets has no meaning as customers are postponing construction due to the inflated prices.”“We get dozens of query calls every day but customers are not placing orders. Labouers are also unemployed as the price hike has caused a fall in demand for construction,” he said. The sales manager of a cement company said manufacturing plants were not running at full capacities and supplies remained obstructed due to contrasting stances of deputy commissioners in different districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/with-mining-on-halt-construction-material-becomes-dearer/story-K06J44ZLfWNkpFikwyageJ.html

13-05-2020||Kolkata||Echoing Mamata’s views, Chhattisgarh CM accuses PM of taking unilateral decisions||Lending a strong voice of support to Mamata Banerjee who charged the Centre with discrimination, Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel said that leaking of central action and communications to the media ahead of informing states tantamounts to undermining their power. Within days of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s video conference with the chief ministers, Baghel said that even the Tamil Nadu chief minister has raised concern of not coordinating and informing states ahead of sending migrant trains, putting everybody in a grave danger of the novel coronavirus. “If the statements are made (by central leaders) and the information is leaked to newspapers including about the visit of the central team, then the states are justified in getting angry,” he told PTI in an interview. Making a strong case for a more coordinated approach in the battle against the coronavirus, Baghel said the states “need to be and must be” taken into confidence. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has recently accused the Centre of “playing politics” and dubbed as “poorly planned” exercise of national lockdown. She had attacked Union Home Minister Amit Shah for allegedly releasing to the media a letter he had written to the state about not allowing trains to ferry migrant labourers to West Bengal. “...why did Mr. Amit Shah need to write a letter and send that to the press? After it was out in the news, people were asking me. What am I supposed to do? Why don’t you speak to us directly? I request this must not happen to other states,” a TMC press release had quoted her as having said in the meeting with the prime minister. In a video conference with Modi, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister K Palaniswami has opposed resumption of passenger train services and air services in the state till May 31. “We know from media that regular train service to Chennai (from Delhi) and from Chennai will commence from May 12. As the positive cases in Chennai are showing an increasing trend, don’t permit train service up to 31.5.2020, in my state,” Palaniswami had told Modi. Baghel said the states need to be taken into confidence before any measure is initiated while pointing out had the Centre consulted states on time, many of the hardships could have been averted. Citing the plight of labourers who are forced to travel by foot on roads and on railway tracks, the chief minister of the Congress-ruled state said it is heart-wrenching to see starvation or accidental deaths. “If the central government had done all arrangements (related to the movement of workers) before they allowed the movement of migrants, then we would have not seen such frightening scenes of large numbers of people walking on the roads barefoot and with all their family members,” he said. Baghel said that had the Centre decided on the resumption of trains for ferrying workers and on their movement, before March 24, pains of labourers could have been minimised. “They should have arranged for their movement earlier. They should have taken the states into confidence. There was no arrangement for buses and trains for the workers. People are worried. They want to go back to their home. Some are going on foot and even walking on railway tracks. It is resulting in death of some as well, which is heart-wrenching,” he said. On the question of returning migrant workers to his state, Baghel said some of them might have the potential of carrying the deadly virus. “We have done all preparations to deal with it. It is true that thousands of workers and stranded people of Chhattisgarh are coming back to the state. They will come from red zone and orange zone. Who all might they meet on the way and get contamination? It is a matter of concern for us. But we have done all preparations for it,” he said. Baghel said over 16,000 quarantine centres have been made in villages so that these people can be kept there in case of need for 14 days. “We have to manage their food and shelter as well and also for the employment needs after they have completed 14 days’ quarantine. None of the states like Chhattisgarh is trying to run way from its responsibility of providing basic needs to these returning workers,” he said. The chief minister, however, said if the states do not know about the trains carrying workers started by the Centre, then there are chances of cases of infection going up. “If we do not know where would people go after coming from trains? If we do not know whether they are clean or carrying the infection? Then there is a possibility of infection cases going up,” he said. Baghel said the states should have the rights to decide on what all activities can be started for reviving the economy and also on resumption of inter-state road, rail and air services for the passengers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/echoing-mamata-s-views-chhattisgarh-cm-accuses-pm-of-taking-unilateral-decisions/story-Q4OBlldHk0R4UTE1EfIdLL.html

13-05-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab professionals are back to the soil, organically||Highly qualified professionals are increasingly quitting their lucrative jobs and returning to Punjab to try their hand at organic farming. These new-age farmers, compost kit makers and teachers are using social media, participating in pop-up organic farmers’ markets and organising day-long farm tours to ensure those wanting pesticide-free food grains don’t have to look too far. ‘ASCERTAIN ECONOMIC BENEFITS FOR FARMERS’Rahul Sharma, a former top executive in a leading IT company, now grows cereal grains, pulses, oil seeds, turmeric and garlic at his five-acre farm in Kapurthala “If the government is serious about providing nutritional security, then it must ascertain that farmers get economic benefits so they can go in for sustainable agriculture,” he says. Sharma does not regret switching his job. He regularly lectures and interacts with school and college students. He has decided to streamline the production and ordering process. “I have now a set rotation of crops, which provide nutrition to the soil, as well as work well in the consumer market,” he says. ‘GREATER AWARENESS AMONG CONSUMERS’Shivraj Bhullar, who has a four-acre farm in Manimajra, left his cushy banker job in Canada to start organic farming in 2014. “The organic farming convention that was held in the region in 2015 brought a lot of people together. Since then, the movement has been growing and there is greater awareness among consumers,” he says. He plans to improve his farm by installing a drip irrigation system and rain water harvesting. Coordinator of the Chandigarh Farmers’ Market, Seema Jolly, owns a five-acre farm in village Karoran in Punjab. Seema wants her farm to be a school for organic/natural farming, yoga and Ayurveda in the near future. One of the directors of the Baikunth Resorts Pvt Ltd, Jolly started organic farming in 2011 and there has been no looking back.‘GOVT’S POLICY OF 100% WHEAT PROCUREMENT MUST CHANGE’. Former national-level hockey player Mohanjit Dhaliwal, has two farms , one in Ropar and another in Fathegrah Sahib, the latter being part of perma-culture food forest in ‘Sanjhi Mitti Food Forest Community’, has been involved in organic farmer for 10 years now. On roadblocks, he feels, that the government’s policy of 100% wheat paddy procurement has to change. “Farmers, who used to be entrepreneurs and solutions finders, are now behaving like robots. Nothing is going to change unless policy makers get out of process.” Chandigarh-based Jyoti Arora, who supplies odour-free composters in Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Chandigarh to houses, hotels, institutions, municipalities, and engages with Swachh Bharat teams of different municipalities, says, “I also do a lot of lecture demonstrations to encourage people to go green.” ORGANIC WAY OF LIFE Everything changed for Diksha Suri, a former corporate communications head with a major hospital chain when she spent time at Auroville in 2004. “Being there and learning from experts started a journey of a more conscious approach towards the living greens and browns. I attended formal workshops and started experimenting with an organic way of living,” says Suri, who, along with a friend set up Chandigarh’s first Nature Club in 2012. Chandigarh-based Rishi Miranshah, who has made the nine-part docu-series ‘The Story of Food - A No Fresh Carbon Footprint’ says, “Considering what chemicals have been doing to our food and the need to switch to organic, it was important for me to make this documentary which is an investigation, tracing the trail of devastations bringing us to the point where we are today.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-professionals-are-back-to-the-soil-organically/story-0LFQNERxBQcoQu2Mpfz8XL.html

13-05-2020||Lucknow||Cities after Covid-19: Will the Sangam city regain its vibrancy?||The sandy banks of the Sangam, which witnessed over 240 million people bathe in its holy water early last year, today stands as a mute testimony to the Covid fear.With the coronavirus fear gripping the entire world some questions haunting the Sangam city residents are: In an era of social distancing and mass sanitising, would the religious congregation of several crore in the annual Magh Mela, the six-yearly Ardh Kumbh or the grand 12-yearly Kumbh Mela be a reality now? Or how far could a virus distance the devotee from his/her beliefs and rituals?The city has a complex mix of religion and tourism, which is gasping for breath, now.Rajendra Paliwal, general secretary of Prayagwal Sabha, the official body of ‘teerth purohits’ in Prayagraj, said: “If the forthcoming Magh Mela, to be held in January-February 2021, is called off, it would be the first time in history to be cancelled. It would be a decision based on belief versus well being. Not even the mughals in their 500-year rule or British in their 100-year rule called it off,” he said.According to Paliwal, a sixth generation ‘teerth purohit’, around 800 families, roughly having 10 members each, are dependent on ‘purohiti’, the act of guiding Hindu devotees in performing religious rituals.“Every purohit family, during the annual fair, earn enough cash, and kind, from devotees to survive the whole year. ‘Pratishtha’ and ‘maryada’ are of utmost importance for a purohit, who despite hailing from a middle class background, would never beg. But the pandemic has spelled trouble never thought off. Purohits, after the mela, also visited houses of devotees, on their invitation, the rest of the year for collecting food grains from their fields. But this year, owning to the lockdown, they could not go visiting,” he added.The annual mela also spells economic boom for sectors like food and hospitality too. According to Joginder Singh, president of Prayagraj Hotel and Restaurant Association, over 100 hotels exist in city limits, which on a monthly basis, owing to the lockdown, were losing of Rs 1,000 million (Rs 100 crore).“The future of hotels for at least the next one year is bleak. The corona pandemic has spelled doom for the hotel industry. The Magh Mela meant business for hospitality sector in the city. But now the fear of the pandemic will continue to cast its affect on our cash registers,” he added.Similarly, the tourism industry will be at receiving end post lockdown owing to the pandemic.Tourism department officials said Prayagraj received the maximum ever of over 280 million tourists in 2019, including the 240 million tourists who participated in the mela. The Kumbh crowd comprised of 23,94,70,000 Indian tourists besides 10,30,000 foreign tourists.The official graph of tourist footfall in the past five years in Prayagraj had recorded a steady rise. For example in 2015, around 41 million tourists visited Sangam city which swelled to around 42 million in 2016. In 2017, nearly 42 million tourists arrived in Prayagraj while in 2018 the figures increased to over 45 million. The figure significantly swelled to over 285 million in 2019.A senior UP Tourism department official, who did not want to be named, said the pandemic will hurt the tourism industry like nothing before. “Prayagraj is one of the major revenue earners for the state as far as tourism is concerned. But sadly, no one can help as far as revival of tourism in state post lockdown is concerned as the lurking corona fear will kill even a bleak chance of revival of tourism,” he added.President of UP chapter of Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), Mahendra Kumar Goyal, claimedfinancial loss suffered by businesses during lockdown was a staggering Rs 60,000 million.“The whopping financial loss includes Rs 2,750 million of hotel industry, Rs 6,500 million of shops selling clothes, shoes etc, Rs 10,000 million each of FMCG and transport sectors, Rs 3,000 million of electronics and electrical good, Rs 170 million of shops selling laptops and mobiles etc, Rs 17,000 million of jewellery shops, Rs 8,000 million of automobile and spare part dealers, Rs 9,000 million of shops selling building construction material etc.“Also, around 4 lakh residents engaged in different sectors are also at the receiving end as most of them have lost their jobs,” he added.Prof GC Tripathi of department of economics, Allahabad University, said: “The government will have to initiate well-planned short and long term approach to bring the economy on track. Under short term measures, the government will have to ensure availability of essentials to all, specially the migrants and low income group people. Likewise, under the long term measures establishing of small cottage industries and business ventures to re-establish displaced rural masses should be a priority.”As per the economist, post lockdown every economy, both developed and developing, would adoptprotective measures to deal with any such pandemic-like situation in future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/cities-after-covid-19-will-the-sangam-city-regain-its-vibrancy/story-ezqCdP39I0JECFGJTi37uN.html

13-05-2020||Chandigarh||Militant leadership void in Kashmir, Pak desperate, says Lt-Gen BS Raju||Notwithstanding the coronavirus pandemic, Kashmir is bracing for a familiar summertime pattern of last three decades of Pakistan-sponsored insurgency: an escalation in infiltration bids on an increasingly ‘live’ Line of Control and a surge in militant violence in the hinterland. The killing last week of two army officials in an encounter, followed quickly by security forces’ retaliatory operation eliminating Riaz Naikoo, a top commander of Hizbul Mujahidin, are the latest pointers to what may lie ahead in the volatile Valley agog with a new portent of likely impact of withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan. In an interview with Executive Editor Ramesh Vinayak, Lt-Gen BS Raju, General Officer Commanding of Srinagar-based 15th Corps, dwelt on the current situation and security challenges in the Valley. Edited excerpts:What is your assessment of the current security scenario in Kashmir?The present situation in Kashmir is stable but fragile. Precautionary and pre-emptive measures are being taken for the safety and security of people, and these have been instrumental in saving innocent lives. Post-Pulwama, we have successfully neutralised the top local commanders of various terrorist outfits, thus resulting in a leadership void. Many overground workers (OGWs), who were providing logistics and other material support to terrorists, have been apprehended in joint operations with other security agencies.How has the dynamics of Pakistan’s cross-LoC support to terrorism changed in last one year or so?Pakistan has consistently found ways and means to further its agenda of fomenting terror in the Valley. It persists in doing that. Numerous intrusion attempts have been foiled and Pakistan army is constantly resorting to ceasefire violations to support the terrorists’ infiltration.Internet restrictions in Kashmir have rendered the terrorist outfits less effective in carrying out their agenda and limited the spread of false narratives being spread by Pakistan to misguide the youth.What has been the outcome of anti-militancy operations since the abrogation of Article 370 in August last year?Militancy has since been on a sharp decline due to our persistent efforts. We had anticipated that Pakistan will increase its efforts to cause turmoil in Kashmir. In spite of best efforts of Pakistan-sponsored proxies, there has been no loss of civilian life in security operations. That in fact has been the hallmark of efforts of all stakeholders for maintenance of peace in Kashmir.What is the current state of militant outfits active in Kashmir?We work on concepts, and not numbers. And the concept is the constant attempts by Pakistan to infiltrate terrorists and war-like stores to commit sensational terrorist activities. Over the past year, the leadership of all terrorist ‘tanzeems’ (organisatons) including Hizbul Mujahideen, Lashkar-e-Taiba, Ansar Ghazwat-ul Hind and Jaish-e-Mohammed has been effectively targeted and eliminated. There is now a definite leadership void.The number of terrorists presently operating in the Valley has also greatly dwindled owing to the reduced recruitment and the recent successes in the counter-terrorist operations. In all operations, we extend every opportunity to local terrorists to ‘return’. Half way through, the encounters are halted and the parents or society elders are involved to urge the trapped local terrorist to ‘return’. We call it ‘Operation MAA’ where the mothers appeal to their sons gone astray, and we have been successful many times.The terrorist launch pads in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir are full, and Pakistan army is trying hard to push maximum infiltrators into the Valley.What has lately been the trend in local recruitments to militant ranks?The recruitment of local youth in the terrorist ‘tanzeems’ has reduced by more than 45% from 2018 to 2019 and is even lesser in 2020. The Pakistan-sponsored proxies who are instigating and indulging in stone-throwing and recruitment have failed in their attempts. Today, the stone-throwing has also come down to negligible in the recent months. Also, the life span of a terrorist has come down drastically, with 64% getting eliminated within one year. Joining terrorist ‘tanzeems’ has become a non-lucrative option for the Kashmiri youth have understood the false narratives of separatists and now see through the Pakistan-sponsored propaganda.How has the restrictive Internet impacted the militant outfits?That has rendered the terrorist ‘tanzeems’ less effective in carrying out their agenda and limited the spread of false narratives being spread by Pakistan to misguide the youth of the Valley. Presently, 2G and broadband internet is available and that enables all essential work on the internet. If the high speed internet is restored now, Pakistan will try to vitiate the peaceful environment by employing its online propaganda machinery.What is the current situation on the Line of Control?The Pakistan army knows our capabilities very well. Every day, we have infiltration attempts on LoC even at a time when the whole world is coming together to fight coronavirus. But, our counter-infiltration grid is very effective in neutralising -these infiltrators.What challenges you foresee in the current summer months?Pakistan has always wanted to disrupt normalcy in the Valley and these summer months would be no different. It is unable to digest that Kashmiris are experiencing peace and improved law and order situation. The infiltration bids will go on. The un-coordinated terrorist acts in the hinterland are a sign of desperation. All that is well anticipated. Every plan is in place to thwart any such attempts.The life span of a terrorist in Kashmir has come down drastically, with 64% getting eliminated within one year. Joining terrorist outfits has become a non-lucrative option for the J&K youth.What is your assessment on the likely consequences of the US-Taliban pact in Afghanistan on the security scenario in Kashmir?The developments in the sub-continent, including the US- Taliban deal, will have an impact on the security situation in Kashmir. The terrorist launch pads in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir are full, and Pakistan army is trying its best to push maximum infiltrators into the Valley to disrupt peace.Is the internal security situation in Kashmir steady enough to revive on-ground political activities?On the political front, the government has clearly enunciated the objectives and benefits of the new political landscape. The subject of political conjecturing is not within the purview of my mandate. To support all political/administrative initiatives, security forces have been proactive in ensuring that peace and tranquillity are maintained. We have made repeated appeals to mothers, parents, elders and other opinion makers to ask local boys gone astray to shun the gun and rejoin the mainstream. I am happy that many such boys have chosen to ‘return’.How do you plan to bolster the army’s outreach to the common Kashmiris?Our outreach programmes through Sadbhavana initiatives include quality education to about 10,500 students through 28 army goodwill schools (AGS) in the Valley. The initiatives of Super-50 (engineering) and Super-30 (medical) and capacity building tours to other states, have been very effective and have achieved stupendous results. As per our records, no student of AGS has ever joined terrorism. It proves that good parenting and quality education make better citizens.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/militant-leadership-void-in-kashmir-pak-desperate-says-lt-gen-bs-raju/story-s3JuNEwcb2a3enwbdrSK1K.html

The probe was ordered after the hospital tranche of masks to the health department citing doctors’ unwillingness to wear them.Indore district collector Manish Singh also shifted the officer in-charge of the health department’s store.A week ago, Dr Anand Rai, a whistleblower in the Vyapam scam, had raised the issue of quality of masks provided to health workers in Indore.Dr Rai posted a picture of what he said was fungus coated mask on his Twitter account. “Packaging of PPE and mask was more important and that storage and manufacturing units of PPE and masks should be bacteria and fungus free,” he wrote on Twitter.Around the same time, a Twitter user Raj Shekhar wrote, “Just got off a call with my sister who is a doctor at a red zone hospital in Indore. She told me that she and her co-residents refused to enter the Covid ward today morning because they realised that the face mask being provided to them were fake.”When contacted, chief medical and health officer Dr Pravin Jadia confirmed that an inquiry had been initiated and the in-charge of the store shifted. He, however, said, “The masks provided were not purchased by the department but gifted by some organisations. There are several individuals and organisations who donate such masks. They are helping us at the time of crisis. There is no mechanism in the department to issue any certificate on the quality of such masks donated.”Dr PS Thakur of MY Hospital said, “It’s unfortunate that a controversy is being created that the masks returned were fake. We never said that masks were fake. Also, the masks were not sub-standard either. The only issue was that our doctors didn’t like it. Our doctors are using the best of masks that we purchase and also get from health department.”“If we raise doubt against intention of such people who donated the masks it will be very unfortunate for Indore and it will discourage others from coming forward to help people at the time of tragedy,” he further said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/indore/doctors-at-indore-hospital-refuse-to-wear-covid-19-masks-probe-ordered/story-e20w6jZj41V9aDWtvQzHnK.html

13-05-2020||Delhi||Haryana requests Delhi to issue special passes for govt employees||The Haryana government on Tuesday informed the Delhi High Court that it had requested the additional chief secretary of the home department of the Delhi government to issue special passes to the employees working with the Delhi government to facilitate their commute to and from Delhi. However, to date, no reply has been received from the Delhi government. A senior official in the chief minister’s office said, “We haven’t received any letter from Haryana government.”Stating that about 56% of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in the national capital region districts of Gurugram, Faridabad, Jhajjar and Sonepat had Delhi connections, the Haryana government on Tuesday told the Delhi High Court they would allow the movement of medical professionals from Delhi only on the basis of passes. Gurugram and Faridabad, on Tuesday, did allow medical professionals, health workers and sanitation personnel to cross the borders from Delhi, said the police, nearly two weeks after Haryana government curbed the movement of people from the Capital. Amit Khatri, deputy commissioner (DC), Gurugram, said, “The borders connecting Delhi have now been de-sealed for people associated with emergency services and for medical professionals. We will monitor the situation closely and changes will be made only after the situation has been brought under control. Unregulated movement at the Gurugram-Delhi borders will not be allowed.”Hearing a public interest litigation, the Delhi HC on May 8 had said that orders of Sonepat district magistrate (DM) obstructing the movement of doctors, nurses, court officials and trucks from Delhi to Sonepat constituted an infringement of the constitutional provisions.The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on May 1 asked the states to ensure that interstate movement of medical professionals, nurses, paramedics is facilitated. The directions came after the issue of restrictions being imposed by some states including Haryana was flagged during a meeting of the cabinet secretary and state governments on Sunday. “ Ensuring unhindered movement of medical professionals is essential for meeting public health requirements and saving precious human lives,” Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla said in his communication to the state governments.Haryana’s additional advocate general (AAG) Anil Grover who appeared for the state government on Monday told the court that in furtherance of May 11 directions of the MHA, the state government has evolved a procedure of movement passes (e-passes) which will be given to medical professionals without any hassle. “Today we have provided about 55 passes to medical professionals living in Haryana’s NCR districts and working in All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, to facilitate their interstate movement around the national capital,’’ Grover said.The neighbouring state told the court that they since the majority of cases till May 9 in the bordering districts of Haryana are mainly due to their Delhi connection, it became imperative in the interest of the public to impose stricter restrictions on the movement of people.The HC, however, asked the Central government to convince the state government not to press for movement passes and resolve the issue. A bench of Justice Manmohan and Justice Sanjeev Narula also asked the Haryana government for an additional affidavit detailing the situation on the ground and posted the matter for May 14.The AAG said that the argument is centred around the fact that the majority of Covid-19 cases in four districts were an outcome of the daily commute of passengers from Haryana’s NCR districts to the national capital. He also stated that the movement of doctors, nurses and paramedics is not being halted on the borders.The movement restriction orders are not Delhi-centric. They applied to interdistrict travel within Haryana as well as to the movement of commuters to Uttar Pradesh, the AAG said. “ The entire endeavour is to ensure that the pandemic does not enter the rural areas of Haryana because there will be havoc if it does,’’ Grover told the HC.In an affidavit filed before the court, the state government said that the April 30 orders of Sonepat district magistrate had exempted the movement of ambulances, ATM cash vans, LPG, oil containers, tankers from Delhi. Besides, the movement of grains, milk, poultry, cereals, lentils and other eatables, excluding fruits and vegetables from Delhi, green and dry fodder, medicines and medical equipment and transit logistics movement of essential and non-essential goods was allowed by the Sonepat administration.The Haryana government, in the affidavit, also told the Court that on April 24, the deputy commissioner, Sonepat, had written to the Delhi government stating that the e- passes for the government employees would not only help in the regulation of movement but also have prevented people from Delhi, claiming to be on official duty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/haryana-requests-delhi-to-issue-special-passes-for-govt-employees/story-VU8RzPI8zyTmlqQAGsbhOP.html
13-05-2020||Delhi||Covid-19 lockdown: Domestic workers allowed now, yet RWAs and residents lock horns||Even with government’s approval on allowing a certain number of domestic workers back into Delhi-NCR societies, the debate continues whether to let them rejoin work or no. And though some residents, out of dire need of help in household chores, are desperately wanting to have house helps back, some RWAs are just not giving a nod. Under directions issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs, the RWAs have been asked to take a call on whether domestic helpers would be allowed in their localities, following the recent relaxation incorporated during lockdown 3.0. Tensions have also surfaced between residents who are on the opposite ends of the matter to whether allow the workers inside the societies, or no. Take for instance, a resident of Delhi’s Safdarjung Enclave informs that his RWA is still deliberating on whether domestic workers should be allowed into the area, or not. On condition of anonymity, he adds, “There are people who do not want to allow domestic helps back into the society at present, but there has been a constant debate on whether an exception can be made for the senior citizens, who need help the most.’’   Missing your domestic helps right now? Watch this hilarious video and think twice 😜 #MaidInHeaven * * * * * #maidvideo #SIT #shittyideastrending #sitvideos #Babymaid #iconicmaid #domestichelp #househelp #funnyvideo #funnymaidvideoA post shared by  SIT (@shittyideastrending) on May 4, 2020 at 6:30am PDTIn Mahagun Moderne society at Noida’s sector 78, the RWA joint secretary Shweta Gupta informs that they are opposed to allowing maids back into the locality. “The cases are increasing by the day and residents’ safety can’t be compromised with, inspite of the recent government orders,” she says, adding, “There are some residents who are keen to allow maids, and at the same time there are those who think otherwise. We have a very big society and any action we take may lead to undesired consequences. Though we understand many residents are facing problems, especially in case of those who have no helping hand in form of a younger person at home, but the decision to not allow outsiders is for the benefit of all.’’ If the RWAs have strong arguments for denying entry to domestic helps, then the residents, especially those living in apartment complexes, have their own concerns. Payal Singh, who lives in a gated society in Delhi’s Janakpuri, says that the absence of domestic help has made it hard for her to juggle work and care for her aged parents. “My office requires me to work long hours during the day. I’m managing food and household chores but it’s getting exhausting now. I understand the safety concerns, but to do so in spite of the government orders allowing for domestic help is unfair!’’In Gurugram’s DLF Hamilton Court, part-time workers have been allowed since the lockdown was eased on May 4. Isha Bhandari, culture secretary of the RWA, says ‘’Many senior citizens and younger residents who require assistance have opted to call domestic helps... but there are concerns within a section of residents around how we can ensure the well being of others. The RWA has set up an internal committee of residents to address all the concerns that are being raised in this matter.’’||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/covid-19-lockdown-domestic-workers-allowed-now-yet-rwas-and-residents-lock-horns/story-N6cELiDyT4lRlO9Ln3zUkJ.html
13-05-2020||Delhi||Coronavirus jinx: DU aspirants for 2020 miss enjoying campus life||According to the recent instructions by the University Grants Commission (UGC), colleges in the Capital will reopen from August. This means that the admission process shall kick-start from August, and the new batch of students aka freshers will get to join classes and visit the campus not until it’s September. The delay in DU’s admission process is due to the coronavirus pandemic. And this has left those were looking forward to enter campuses as soon as possible, quite heart broken! “Why us? I mean aaise kya hi karm kiye the ki we have to face this,” questions Dev Gupta, a Delhi-based student who had high hopes of getting to visit the campus and attend college earlier than expected now. He adds, “My sister is from Delhi University, and so is my father. I have heard so much about DU from them. And now was the time to experience whatever they used to talk about, but Covid-19 has ruined it all for me... September is too far!” For a college-goer, it’s pretty chill at this time of the year to find memes around college cut-off and sweat over every cut-off list that gets announced. But right now, it’s just the pandemic and its affects that are ruling the Internet. Saumya Sharma, a Gurugram-based student, says, “When I was in high school, every year I used to see a rush to get admission in one of the best colleges, and the internet getting flooded with talks and memes on who made it and how! But this year, it’s highly unlikely to feel all that. In fact, some days I search out for old memes and just look at them to feel better. Kuchch to pata lage college life ke baare mein!” The question is how to wrap around one’s mind on this. Teachers suggest taking the online route. Dr Kanika K Ahuja, associate professor, department of psychology, Lady Shri Ram College for Women, DU, says, “Moving forward, we need newer roadmaps. Newcomers need to take onus of their learning and not depend on teacher’s spoon-feed. Online classes will be the future for quite some time; so learn not to get distracted. Work on your attention spans and be intrinsically motivated. Peer learning will be hampered, so depend on yourselves. Develop other skill sets like writing, research, analyses, and above all, self-determination and resilience... It’s appreciable that flexibility is given to the universities to frame their own examination and academic calenders, keeping in view the UGC guidelines and preparedness and constraints so that the vulnerable sections of students are not adversely affected.” Anil Kumar, associate professor at Shri Ram College of Commerce (SRCC), echoes the same sentiment: “I am of the view that there would be possibilities of disruptions in the traditional mode of teaching in the next academic session. Universities and colleges should prepare themselves by augmentation of online capabilities to conduct some of the courses or portion of the courses online. This should be mandated by the UGC with the necessary funding backup.” Follow @htdelhi for more||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/coronavirus-jinx-du-aspirants-for-2020-miss-enjoying-campus-life/story-P55FStOGHHb96pgkvcdnFP.html

We thought kuch aisa hona chahiye jisse log jagruk ho,” says Rajesh Sharma, SHO, RK Puram Police Station, adding, “We wanted to educate people in an interesting manner and therefore thought of asking the artist to dress up like Yamraj. And, corona Yamraj ki tarah hi hai... The artist dressed up as Yamraj said ‘Main Yamraj hoon aur maine Corona bheja hua hain aapke paas, aur agar aap ghar ke andar nahin rahenge toh mera doot aapko uthake le jaayega.

She is so young, she does not know a thing about coronavirus. How will the teachers ensure that she does not touch her face or wash her hands constantly? Will a child as young as her be safe in school?” asked a Panchkula-based parent, Manoj Khattri.As deliberations continue at the Centre as well as the local level to re-open schools in phases, parents across the tricity are concerned about their children attending school amid the pandemic.Although most of the parents are not in favour of sending their kids out yet, the group is divided when it comes to senior students who say they won’t mind sending them to the school if proper precautions are taken.OKAY WITH SENDING SENIORS TO SCHOOLVikas Kumar, a shopkeeper based in Mohali, said, “My son is in class 10. It is a crucial year for him. Although he is taking the online classes, they are not as effective as regular classroom teaching. If students follow social distancing norms or the odd-even scheme is implemented, I think schooling could be safely resumed.”Madhura Kapoor of Panchkula said, “Children learn the most from their peers. Eventually, schooling and classroom teaching have to start. It can begin in phases with the senior-most classes as they know how to behave themselves.”On the other hand, parents of the students studying in junior classes say that the kids, even under strict supervision, cannot be made to ensure social distancing and hygiene.Saumya Suman Rawat, a 33-year-old homemaker from Chandigarh, said, “A child who is not even capable of keeping their beds and study tables clean, schools are expecting them to be super vigilant.”Dipti BR, an IT manager based in Panchkula, said, “When a school doesn’t allow kids to attend classes in case they have a regular flu, how can they force them to come to school now? Kids have low immunity,” adding, “Some parents are already taking unpaid leaves just to make sure their kids are home and safe.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/parents-flag-concerns-as-schools-in-and-around-chandigarh-consider-reopening/story-mU1yEqx40hWMOkaZkARZKL.html
13-05-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab chief secy Karan Avtar relieved of financial commissioner taxation charge||Three days after his showdown with state ministers, Punjab chief secretary Karan Avtar Singh was on Tuesday night relieved of the additional charge of financial commissioner taxation.On Monday, finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal and his other cabinet colleagues had asked chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh to sack the chief secretary saying they won’t be part of meetings attended by Karan Avtar.Amarinder’s move, which came after a flurry of activity in the state top brass to find a way out of the crisis, is seen as an attempt to mollify the ministers“This will certainly pacify the ministers,” said a cabinet minister, pleading anonymity. The chief minister has in fact adopted a middle path. He has taken care of ministers’ grouse and tried not to upset the bureaucracy by axing the chief secretary.The chief secretary had taken on the ministers at a pre-cabinet meeting on the excise policy on Saturday, insisting that the changes recommended by the ministers to the policy could not be taken on board. The unsavoury face-off had led to ministers storming out of the meeting, with Manpreet being the first one to walk out. Principal secretary (water resources) A Venu Prasad will now hold the additional charge of financial commissioner taxation, according to an order issued here. As Prasad is on leave till May 20, principal secretary finance Anirudh Tewari will look after the work of the post of financial commissioner Ttaxation in addition to his present assignments, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-chief-secy-karan-avtar-relieved-of-financial-commissioner-taxation-charge/story-ZIx7ZrqaozEe3GNkEBiU6K.html
13-05-2020||Chandigarh||Now, people returning from abroad can rent a place for ₹100-10,000 a day in Chandigarh||After concerns regarding lack of stay options for people returning from abroad came to the fore, the administration on Tuesday finalised a new rate list according to which accommodation in Chandigarh can now be availed for ₹100-10,000 per day.The first batch of five passengers arrived here from Delhi late in the night. While they are all being kept at the Mountview Hotel where per day stay fare varies between ₹5,000-10,000 depending upon the type of room, those coming in the future batches will be given the option to choose. But there is a catch here: the lowest fare of ₹100 per day is reserved for low-income group returnees.UT home secretary AK Gupta said that not all those returning from abroad are well-off. “For them, we have roped in 50 independent rooms with attached bathrooms at girls hostel number 10 on Panjab University campus for ₹100 per day and meal charges as per actual rates,” he said. For others, the UT-run hotels are already lined up.RATE LIST AVAILABLE ONLINEThe persons will be told about the options when they land at the airport, he said. The rate list will also be uploaded online. The local contacts of those coming from abroad can also seek local inquiry regarding different stay options.“For now arrangements have been made for around 500 persons that will be gradually increased depending on the rush of passengers,” said Gupta.He, however, said how many passengers were actually coming would only be confirmed once they boarded the planes. UT adviser Manoj Parida earlier estimated the arrival of 5,000 people from abroad.TESTING MADE MANDATORYOn Tuesday, the administration made Covid testing mandatory for all those returning from abroad, even though it has not been suggested by the central government. Parida said there will be two levels of screening—at the airport and on arrival. All those found negative will be allowed to go to their houses after mandatory 14-day quarantine period, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/now-people-returning-from-abroad-can-rent-a-place-for-100-10-000-a-day-in-chandigarh/story-esNV7QmcRoO7hUmZoNYtUJ.html

At the age of 13, Jyoti came to Kharar, and is now heading the gaddi here.In the last 40 days, they have distributed around 5,000 rations kits containing rice, flour, oil, tea leaves, sugar, among other essential items. Each kit has a ration to last for about 15 days.“People have my phone number and they call me seeking ration,” added Jyoti who has distributed 100 ration kits in Sialba Majri village and another 100 in Hoshiarpur village in Kharar. “Sometimes we get calls from outside the district, too,” they said.After they get a call, Jyoti and his associates gets in touch with the panchayat of the village and prepares a list of people. Accordingly, purchases in bulk are made and then packing is done at Jyoti’s house. The store room is stacked and with the help of other transgenders persons of her gaddi, kits are prepared to be distributed.“I want other members of our community to come out and help the society in this hour of need,” said Jyoti, who like other transgender persons, too, has faced a lot of stigma. They make it a point to inform the police station concerned wherever they go for distributing ration, said Jyoti||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/members-of-transgender-community-deliver-5-000-ration-kits-in-40-days-in-kharar/story-ywqH4yiXL1EJz0ZtILBNiL.html

A single-judge bench of justice Bharati Dangre said given the serious allegations of money laundering, with a conspiracy entered into by Wadhawans with several others, particularly Yes Bank promoter Rana Kapoor and his family members, call for their custodial interrogation. ED had initiated proceedings against the Wadhawans based on an first information report (FIR) registered by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on March 7, 2020 against Kapoor for conspiracy, cheating and under relevant provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act.It is alleged that between April and June 2018, Yes Bank invested Rs 3,700 crore in short-term, non-convertible debentures of DHFL and Kapoor received Rs 600 crore as kickbacks from DHFL, in the form of loan advanced to two firms, DOIT Urban Ventures (India) Private Limited and Morgan Credits Private Limited. While Kapoor’s daughters hold 100℅ stake in DOIT, Morgan Credits is controlled by his wife.The Wadhawans, however, maintained that these transactions were entered into regular course of business. They sought pre-arrest bail, claiming that there was no fraudulent misrepresentation and no wrongful loss was caused to the bank in the transactions.Additional solicitor general Anil Singh, appearing for the ED, opposed the pleas and stated that the debentures were not yet redeemed by DHFL and Yes Bank had not received its amount back. He added that DHFL has extended a loan of Rs 600 crore to the firms controlled by Kapoor’s family by showing grossly overvalued properties as mortgages.Justice Dangre accepted ED’s arguments. The judge said that only the applicants can throw light on the nature of the transactions and the alleged conspiracy can be cracked only by interrogating them.The applicants will have to be confronted with variousincriminating documents regarding the loans sanctioned by Yes Bank and further loans sanctioned by the DHFL in favour of Kapoor to unearth the multi-crore conspiracy, added the judge. Justice Dangre also rejected anticipatory bail pleas of the Wadhawans in connection with diversion of funds from two trusts in Uttar Pradesh - Uttar Pradesh State Power Sector Employees Trust and Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Contributory Provident Fund Trust. Both trusts have received part of their funds invested in DHFL, but are yet to receive about Rs 2,268 crore.The judge said ED was justified in seeking custodial interrogation of the accused, as the crime involved complicated financial linkages and involvement of several individuals and group of companies. Widespread business activities of the applicants call for deep search into the money trail, added the bench.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-rejects-pre-arrest-bail-pleas-of-wadhawan-brothers/story-ocIacQZ8MmL4xdc2pJniHN.html
13-05-2020||Mumbai||Court allows terror accused to see mother’s funeral through video call||The sessions court on Tuesday allowed Faisal Mirza, booked for conspiring to carry out terror attacks in various places in Gujarat, Mumbai and Uttar Pradesh to attend his mother’s funeral through a video call.Mirza’s lawyer Arshad Shaikh had on Tuesday morning approached the special court to direct the prison authorities to make necessary arrangements for him to attend the funeral of his mother who passed away on Tuesday morning.The court after hearing the plea directed the prison authorities to arrange a video call for Mirza. The court has further directed the prison authorities to submit a report for the same. Mirza, a 32-year-old electrician and resident of Jogeshwari, was allegedly in touch with Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) members. Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) officials said his association with the terror outfit that carried out November 26, 2008, attack on Mumbai became stronger when he went to Sharjah and later Dubai in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).Mirza was arrested by Maharashtra ATS in May 2018. He was allegedly planning to kill several leading politicians, film personalities, and also conduct a series of bomb explosions in various cities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/court-allows-terror-accused-to-see-mother-s-funeral-through-video-call/story-EY5rC8tYXuw8aVEfbvJXLO.html
13-05-2020||City||Migrant labourers block Ludhiana-Delhi highway||Around 250 migrant labourers blocked the Ludhiana-Delhi National Highway near Kakowal Road here on Tuesday alleging inadequate arrangements for their journey back to their native places.The blockade started at around 11am and continued for at least one hour before the police reached the spot and dispersed the protesters using mild force.Some protesters also alleged that the police personnel are demanding Rs 500 as bribe for allowing them to board the special trains run by the government for their departure.A labourer said that they have no work due to the lockdown and are left with no money. The administration is not making adequate arrangements to send them back, he added.Another labourer said he reached the railway station to board the train but the police personnel did not allow him to board it, saying it is already full. “I had my booking confirmed but was not allowed to go.”ADCP Gurpreet Singh Sikand said the agitators were from Kishanganj and Araria districts of Bihar. They were demanding special trains for their districts. “We have conveyed their demand to senior officials.”To a question, the ADCP said the police did not use any force against the labourers. They fled after seeing the police vehicles, he added.On May 3, around 250 migrant labourers had gathered on the national highway near Dhandari and blocked the road for around 20 minutes.75,000 MIGRANTS HAVE LEFT FOR HOME STATES FROM FEROZEPUR DIVISIONAs many as 63 Shramik Special Trains have ferried 75,000 migrants from three stations of Ferozepur divison to their native states so far.On Tuesday, a total of 13 such trains departed from Ludhiana, Jalandhar and Amritsar railway stations. Of these, six trains carrying around 1,200 migrants each, left from Ludhiana, while five trains departed from Jalandhar and two from Amritsar.Divisional railway manager (DRM) Rajesh Agarwal informed that as of now, 41 trains have left for Uttar Pradesh; 15 for Bihar; four for Jharkhand; two for Madhya Pradesh; and one for Chhattisgarh. More such trains will run in coming days, he added.6TH SPL TRAIN LEAVES MOHALI FOR CHHAPRA Meanwhile, the sixth special train left the Mohali railway station for Chhapra in Bihar carrying 1,201 migrant workers. The migrants were taken to the railway station in buses from eight collection centres where they were first screened. The district administration provided packed food and water bottles to the migrants, besides distributing chocolates among their children. Also, seven buses left Mohali on Tuesday carrying 160 students to Jammu and Ladakh. Six of these buses left for Jammu and one for Ladakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/migrant-labourers-block-ludhiana-delhi-highway/story-koLAalDHv0972QSip8JigI.html
13-05-2020||Mumbai||Metro lines 2A, 7 to be delayed by 3 months: MMRDA chief||Mumbaiites can expect a three-month delay for Metro 2A (Dahisar-DN Nagar) and Metro -7 (Dahisar East -Andheri East) to get operational, Mumbai metropolitan commissioner RA Rajeev said in a webinar, hosted by a media outlet on Tuesday evening. The two lines were to be operational by December this year.“Though we had a workforce of 11,000 labourers at various sites, the work was stopped for a month or two. Now, many migrant workers are looking at going back to their states. So we are expecting a two to three-month delay. The Metros that were to start in December 2020, might start by March-April next year,” Rajeev said.Though the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) had talked about the delay in the two projects when the lockdown was announced in March, this is for the first time that the commissioner has announced revised dates for the two Metro projects.Rajeev also said that the delay period has been estimated as per the current situation.“If we see another surge [in Covid-19 cases], we will have to revisit the timelines and finances. These are times of uncertainty. There will be cost escalations and delays that have to be borne,” he said.The 18.6-km Metro-2A project is estimated to cost ₹6,410 crore, while the 16.5-km Metro-7 project is expected to cost ₹6,208 crore.MMRDA is the nodal authority for the Mumbai Metro Master Plan, which is looking at implementing a 337-km network in and around the city. MMRDA is also implementing the Mumbai Trans Harbour Link (MTHL) – a 22-km sea-bridge connecting Mumbai and Navi Mumbai.Rajeev said that MMRDA has resumed work at many sites in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region now and the workers are taking due precautions.“All the workers are wearing masks and adhering to social distancing wherever possible. Hand sanitisers have been provided at all sites. We take two meetings a day to guide them on the precautions to be taken,” he said.The state agency is also building a make-shift 1,008-bed capacity hospital at the MMRDA grounds and is also planning to construct another one at the Bandra-Kurla Complex, Rajeev said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/metro-lines-2a-7-to-be-delayed-by-3-months-mmrda-chief/story-UodpzX0AgmfV4e1OBrDxCK.html

The three men, including two sadhus, were lynched on April 16. They were reportedly mistaken for thieves by the accused. Five policemen from Kasa have been found guilty of failing to protect the victims from the mob while 35 personnel transferred and the Palghar SP Gaurav Singh sent on compulsory leave by the home minister Anil Deshmukh. They are under suspension.Meanwhile, the 105 suspects first arrested a day after the lynching will be produced in Dahanu court on Thursday. The tribals have alleged that innocents are being arrested while the CID said that the arrests are being made as per CCTV images from the spot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/palghar-lynching-case-14-more-held-by-cid/story-GbedCiDpVyk0CtpeUBsvaO.html
13-05-2020||Mumbai||State starts online medical services for non-Covid patients||In an attempt to provide relief to non-Covid patients that are suffering due to the ongoing lockdown, the Maharashtra government started free online teleconsultation medical services from Tuesday. A patient will have to register online after which he or she will be able to directly chat with an expert doctor through video conferencing or text chat on the portal — www.esanjeevaniopd.in.It is a joint venture started with the help of the central government. State health minister Rajesh Tope said this is an online OPD service started considering the difficulties faced by the people in the absence of services of private practitioners. A patient will have to register on the portal with the help of his mobile number. He or she can upload any medical report or other documents available and get a token number. The patient will be notified via to log in on the portal. He or she will be kept in waiting and will be asked to press ‘call now’ button once a doctor is available for them. The patient can directly chat with the doctor through video conferencing or text message and will also get e-prescription after the discussion, the officials said.“In the beginning, it was started on a pilot basis a few days ago but from now on the services is available across the state. A patient from any district of the state can get the benefit of the services,” Tope said.However, the service will be available only in the first half of the day between 9.30am to 1.30pm. It will also not available on Sundays.Tope said that the timings will be increased gradually based on the response from the people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/state-starts-online-medical-services-for-non-covid-patients/story-iBuN9K0yuHilD3qjU57WPP.html
13-05-2020||Mumbai||OBC leaders being sidelined by Maharashtra BJP leadership: Khadse||Senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Eknath Khadse, who was sidelined by the party leadership yet again in the Legislative Council polls, trained guns on state leadership, accusing former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis of consistently working against him.Khadse, along with former ministers Pankaja Munde and Chandrashekhar Bawankule, were given a miss even as party nominated four other candidates for the upcoming elections.The party nominated Gopichand Padalkar, RanjitSinh Mohite Patil, Pravin Datke and Dr Ajit Gopchade to the Legislative Council. Khadse on Monday alleged that the BJP’s state leadership had given a fake impression to him and other two senior leaders that their names were being considered. He also said that he had an offer from the Congress to contest the sixth Legislative Council election and several BJP legislators had even promised to cross vote in his favour against the formal BJP candidate.“Consistently, BJP’s senior leaders, those who have worked for the party are slighted in favour of newcomers. The party which grew with the help of Bahujan leaders is now systematically sidelining OBC leadership. I was told by Fadnavis and state chief Chandrakant Patil that they are trying to get me in the Legislative Council, but these candidates knew they would get a nomination in March itself,’’ said Khadse, speaking to a Marathi TV news channel, ABP Majha.“I was given an offer by Congress but there was no time to act on it. This is not the time to do politics also,’’ he added. Khadse, Munde and Bawankule represent the Other Backward Class (OBC) community. He said that he plans to take up the issue with BJP’s president and then decided the future course of action. “I had given the go-ahead to make Fadnavis the state BJP chief. I gave him an opportunity in the state legislature as the leader of the Opposition. And, I am now facing the consequences of my actions. Forget me, any other party loyalist could have been given a chance instead of outsiders,’’ he added.Padalkar, a Dhangar leader who joined BJP ahead of state Assembly polls and contested polls against senior NCP leader Ajit Pawar, had been promised a rehabilitation by Fadnavis. Similarly, former NCP MP Ranjitsinha Mohite Patil had been promised MLC seat when he and his father Vijaysinh Mohite Patil joined BJP ahead of Lok Sabha polls by the former chief minister. Datke, party’s Nagpur city chief, is seen to be close to both Union minister Nitin Gadkari and Fadnavis.This is not the first time Khadse has complained publicly against the BJP leadership. After Assembly polls, the senior leader had slammed BJP leadership at a public rally held in Beed by Munde. Neither Munde nor Bawankule has, however, complained of the decision publicly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/obc-leaders-being-sidelined-by-maharashtra-bjp-leadership-khadse/story-UqyTZslDNTDCckaQT1rWfI.html
13-05-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai topped in reduction of pollutants among six cities||Mumbai has seen the sharpest reduction in harmful air pollutants during the lockdown among major Indian cities, said the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) on Tuesday.Researchers compared a three-week average pollutant concentration between March 1-21 and March 23 to April 14 for six cities (Delhi, Pune, Ahmedabad, Kolkata, Chennai and Mumbai), using data from multiple monitoring stations including those of the Central Pollution Control Board, the American Consulate, and SAFAR’s own monitoring stations. The results were presented by Gufran Beig, director, SAFAR, from a yet-to-be published research paper, during a the Ministry of Earth Sciences’ webinar on Tuesday.Between March and April, Mumbai has witnessed maximum percentage reduction for two pollutants — nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter (PM) 2.5 (breathable particulate matter which is 2.5 microns in size or smaller) — among the six cities. However, even without major industrial and automobile emissions, Mumbai’s lowest PM2.5 concentration, defined as the baseline or background PM2.5 levels by SAFAR, was highest among six cities.Mumbai recorded a 76% decline in NO2 (gases mainly emitted from automobile fuel burning) followed by Kolkata (67%), Pune (56%), Delhi (39%), Ahmedabad and Chennai (25%). A 54% reduction was recorded for PM2.5 for Mumbai; 40% for both Kolkata and Ahmedabad; 30% for Delhi; 25% in Pune and 11% in Chennai. “Geographical and weather factors are both responsible for maximum pollutant decline in Mumbai against other cities,” said Beig. “Being a coastal city, Mumbai got the advantage of sea breeze resulting in faster dispersion of pollutants. Though the same can be said for Chennai, baseline line levels for the city are already low, but the rate of dispersion is not as high as Mumbai as the financial capital is surrounded by the sea from three sides.”At landlocked cities like Delhi and Ahmedabad, and low dispersion rate for Kolkata, human-induced bio-fuel and industrial emissions combined with sporadic incidents of mild dust storms during lockdown did not allow very high pollutant reduction, said Beig. Meanwhile, background PM2.5 concentration for the study period in Mumbai was 33 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m³) followed by Ahmedabad at 31 µg/m³, Pune 29 µg/m³, Delhi 22 µg/m³, Kolkata 18 µg/m³, and Chennai 6 µg/m³.“Pollution levels can never be zero. Background levels are the permanent concentration in any city when anthropogenic emissions are at its lowest. This shows that even though Mumbai may have high pollutant dispersion, its background air already has higher PM2.5 than other cities. While the lockdown has presented us with an unique opportunity to gather such data, more investigation is needed to understand what causes this,” said Beig.The national safe standard for PM2.5 is 40 µg/m³ for 24 hours while it is 25 µg/m³ for the same duration as per the World Health Organisation (WHO).Independent experts said research was needed to understand sources from the larger airshed in the Mumbai region during lockdown to assess high background PM2.5. “The magnitude of sources like solid fuel usage, power plants or even minimal vehicle movement in the region’s airshed, and how it could be influencing background PM2.5 needs to be assessed,” said Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), Centre for Science and Environment.PM2.5 LEVELS IN MUMBAI’S AIR IN 2019SAFAR on Tuesday presented the emission inventory for PM2.5 pollutant and different sectors contributing to the pollutant in Mumbai’s air during 2019. While the transport sector was the most dominant source at 30.49%, sources titled ‘others’ including open fires, brick kilns, textile plants, dust storms, sea salt etc. all inside and outside the airshed accounted for 20.88%. The residential sector including biofuel or solid fuel emissions for domestic cooking and other activities accounted for 15.52%. Remaining sources 14.8% was from windblown dust and 13.08% from industrial emissions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-topped-in-reduction-of-pollutants-among-six-cities/story-zTkvWf9iMG5f7AZKE6oKPJ.html
13-05-2020||Mumbai||TIFR develops country’s first low-cost device to test efficacy of masks||The Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), Mumbai, has recently developed India’s first low-cost testing equipment to assess the efficacy of facemasks.Considering the shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE), including masks, for frontline health workers during the Covid-19 pandemic, TIFR is also studying how masks can be reused post decontamination.N95 masks are designed for 95% filtration efficiency for very small 0.3 micrometre (µm) sized particles, while surgical or cloth masks are meant mainly for protection from relatively larger droplets of infectious material emitted during coughing, sneezing or talking, according to the Union health ministry.A team of scientists led by professors Arnab Bhattacharya and Shankar Ghosh of TIFR, along with Ronak Sutaria of air quality research group Respirer Living Sciences (RLS), built a prototype — mask integrity test resource (MITR) — using air quality measurement units and other components to develop a setup that measures fine particle (0.3µm) filtration through N95 masks. This was built during the lockdown using home-made items such as a vacuum cleaner, boxes, bottles, and a plastic ball (used as a mannequin).“We estimate that such a unit could be built for ₹30,000-50,000 ranging from the most basic one to a slightly advanced unit within the country,” said Bhattacharya. “Commercially available units that need to be imported cost over ₹10 lakh. At the same time, recent US Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) guidelines restrict the export of PPEs, which will impact the availability in India.”For the project, different types of N95 and surgical masks being used by Tata Memorial Hospital in Mumbai were supplied to TIFR, and were tested using this equipment. The filtration efficiency could drop significantly if the mask was not well fitted, and allowed leaks from the side, Bhattacharya said while cautioning that these experiments were done using a rudimentary set up on a plastic ball. “While we expect a better fit for the human face, we found that even if the best N95 masks are used unless the mask is worn properly or well-sealed from the sides, it can be dangerous for frontline workers,” he said.The TIFR scientists also evaluated the filtration efficiency of several materials used at home for masks – from folded handkerchiefs to cotton T-shirts. “Even home-made masks could have 50-60% filtration efficiency, comparable with surgical masks, and are good for everyday use by the public,” said Bhattacharya. The testing protocol plays a critical role in evaluating the efficiency of masks across intensive care units (ICUs) and health care facilities, said Sutaria. “Many hospitals across India are currently facing a severe shortage of facemasks, leading to the manufacture of varying quality. The existing mask testing equipment available from the US costs between ₹12 lakh to ₹90 lakh. Masks are going to be required not only during Covid-19, but for all kinds of infections and epidemics,” he said, adding that such a low-cost set up could also help in quickly comparing the quality of masks, with the risk of the market being flooded with inferior quality products. The other aspect of TIFR’s research looked at reusability of masks after disinfecting them.According to N95decon.org, an international consortium of scientists and researchers for N95 mask decontamination, alcohol-based disinfectants, soaps or detergents, bleach solutions, ethylene oxide etc. though effective in virus inactivation could degrade the filtration efficiency or leave hazardous residues. However, moist and dry heat treatment, hydrogen peroxide vapour, ozone, and ultraviolet radiation were useful.A major contributing factor that enhances filtration efficiency was a layer of electrically charged fibres that trap particles in N95 masks, TIFR researchers found. The charge diminishes significantly when cleansed using alcohol-based solutions. Researchers developed a procedure to recharge these N95 masks. “We believe recharging could allow recovery of the filtration efficiency of used masks, allowing them to be reused for relatively longer periods than the current norm,” said Ghosh.How masks are being used by city’s health workers Frontline Covid-19 workers from private and municipal hospitals in Mumbai are following a procedure wherein four to five N95 masks are being provided for every 20 days to each person. “A worker will use a mask a day, sterilise it after use, store it safely at the end of the shift, and reuse it again after five days. The same process is repeated for each mask until a new set is supplied,” said a doctor from Nanavati Hospital.A senior surgeon from King Edward Memorial (KEM) Hospital said, “We get four masks for 20 days. We steam the mask before reusing it on the fifth day. Over the past week, health workers dealing with Covid-19 patients in the ICU are getting a new mask every day, and the used ones are discarded daily.”Technology built over weekend amid pandemic Researchers at TIFR and RLS managed the development of the mask testing technology in a matter of days amid restrictions during the ongoing Covid-19 lockdown. As TIFR was developing the mask testing prototype, they got in touch with RLS to use their low-cost air pollution monitoring units, which were supplied within a day. Over just one weekend, TIFR researchers along with RLS managed to develop testing principles, completed their prototype, and were ready to do tests to evaluate filtration efficiency of masks for front-line health care workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/tifr-develops-country-s-first-low-cost-device-to-test-efficacy-of-masks/story-6DzOzG2Qqho1HiaS5VgqsJ.html

Some protesters alleged that police personnel were demanding Rs 500 as bribe to make them board trains.The police reached the spot and dispersed them allegedly using mild force.The labourers said, “We neither have jobs nor money and food to survive. But the administration is not making arrangements to send us back home.”Another labourer said, “After I applied to go back to my hometown, I got a confirmation message on my phone and reached the railway station to board a train, but the police did not allow me to board the train, despite the confirmation message. The police said the train was already full.”Another agitator alleged, “The policemen at the Guru Nanak Stadium are demanding Rs 500 from each person to allow us to board a train. This is how the Punjab government is treating us. I have been living in the city for the past 20 years, but now I want to go back home.”Additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP, city-1) Gurpreet Singh Sikand said, “The agitators are from Kishanganj and Araria districts of Bihar. They are demanding to run trains for Kishanganj and Araria so that they reach their native places. However, we have written to senior officials about demands of labourers.”The ADCP added the police did not use any force against the labourers. Instead, they fled after seeing police vehicles, he said.On May 3, around 250 migrant labourers, residing in Sherpur, Dhandari, Focal Point and nearby areas, had gathered on the National Highway near Dhandari and blocked the road for at least 20 minutes. The labourers also shouted slogans against the Punjab government and the police. The labourers had also pelted the police personnel and vehicles with stones and damaged at least 10 vehicles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/labourers-block-national-highway-in-ludhiana-demand-arrangements-for-sending-them-to-native-places/story-u1zA1d9fUrvEEHhqXYpZLP.html
13-05-2020||Mumbai||HC grants divorce to man after wife writes letter to his employer||The Bombay high court (HC) granted divorce to a 47-year-old Navi Mumbai resident, on the grounds of his estranged wife writing a letter to his employer, levelling unfounded allegations of adultery against him. The division bench of justices VM Deshpande and SM Modak accepted the wife’s act of writing the letter to her husband’s employer “as an actionable cruelty within the purview of Section 13(1) (i-a) of the Hindu Marriage Act” and granted him divorce. The couple married in May 1993 and had two sons. Relations between the spouses soured and in May 2006 the woman left her matrimonial home along with the children.In June 2008, the woman visited her matrimonial home again, break open the lock in absence of her husband and wrote to his employer, stating that he had an extra-marital affair.A few days later, the 47-year-old moved the family court in Nagpur, where the marriage was solemnised. He sought divorce on the grounds of mental cruelty and desertion. He moved the HC in appeal after the family court rejected his divorce petition in March 2012.The HC accepted his contention that the woman’s conduct, making unsubstantiated allegations against the husband, amounted to mental cruelty, as contemplated under the Hindu Marriage Act and the husband was entitled to a divorce. HC said trust and confidence are foundations of a marriage and if one spouse establishes an extra-marital affair, it is considered as an act of damaging the foundation. “And, if one of the spouses makes such allegations and he/she fails to prove it, it is considered as an act causing mental pain to the other spouse and an instance of cruelty,” stated the bench.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-grants-divorce-to-man-after-wife-writes-letter-to-his-employer/story-GFtmCtooMFFuSwxJJPQoTI.html
13-05-2020||City||Covid positive cop’s family harassed by Navi Mumbai building residents||After a 35-year-old police sub-inspector tested positive for Covid-19, her family is facing harassment from the housing society members in Vashi.She and her husband, who works in a local hospital, live in Vashi with their 18-month-old daughter.As the officer worked in the night shift, she used to leave the baby at her parents’ house at Juhu village in Vashi.The officer got herself tested after she had mild fever. On May 7, the report showed that she was infected.After the officer was sent to institution quarantine, the officer’s elderly parents, sister and niece are taking care of the child. The family has self-isolated themselves. They have undergone a test and the reports are awaited.When her parents’ building residents came to know that she has tested positive, they told the family to leave the flat.The officer’s brother, who is working in Bangalore with an IT firm, said, “My sister had last visited our parents’ house around 10 days ago. After the residents came to know that she has tested positive, they started troubling my family.”The family members alleged that the building residents did not let sanitation workers collect garbage and stopped home delivery people from going to their house.On Saturday, at least 10 people from the building and nearby houses gathered around the housing society and asked the family to leave the premises.“After I posted an online complaint to the police, they sent a team to the building. The cops spoke with the residents and pacified them. She got infected while serving the public. People should not harass families of essential service workers who are risking their lives every day,” her brother added.The local police station, however, downplayed the incident.“In such a situation, some people are scared. We spoke to the residents and told them about safety precautions. There was no case registered and it was not a major issue,” said Sanjeev Dhumal, senior inspector at Vashi police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-positive-cop-s-family-harassed-by-navi-mumbai-building-residents/story-UGEp9PouYQ8PQvnaM7XH7K.html

On Monday, after he was discharged from the hospital, the 46-year-old Gorai resident was welcomed by his colleagues and family with a thunderous applause. On April 23, Rane developed fever and cough, which were not cured despite taking medicines. So he went for a test on April 26 and the results came positive for Covid-19 two days later, following which he was admitted to Apex Hospital on the same day. It is not established yet how Rane got infected. During his stay in the hospital, his family, friends and colleagues kept him motivated. Fortunately, the constable does not have comorbidities. “I want to tell my colleagues and others who are battling the disease that they should not panic and keep a strong willpower and they will definitely get cured,” he said, adding that he would consume warm water and gargle with salt water everyday while at the hospital. Until Monday, more than 1,000 personnel of the state police department were tested positive for Covid-19, of who 900 are constables. Rane is among the 113 personnel who have recovered so far. The police department has also lost seven of its personnel to the virus. 2 lakh labourers on ‘waiting list’ to leave cityOn Tuesday, another 5,000 labourers from the Mumbai Police’s north region jurisdiction (Goregaon East to Dahisar East) left for their native homes in north India on four trains. Three trains operated from Borivli station, while one left from Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT). The police said around 2 lakh more migrant labourers are on the ‘waiting list’ and their applications have been processed. 33 FIRs filed on Monday for lockdown violations The Mumbai Police on Monday registered 33 first information reports (FIRs) against 48 people and arrested 22 for lockdown violations. A majority of the FIRs (21) were filed in central region, while the remaining eight in western region – both of which are badly-affected by Covid 19. The most number of FIRs (11) were filed for gathering at one place, followed by 10 against illegal vehicles, nine for not wearing masks and three against shops operating despite being non-essential services.

13-05-2020||Mumbai||State govt allows home delivery of liquor, but not in city, Nagpur||Maharashtra on Tuesday issued a notification allowing home delivery of liquor across the state, barring Mumbai and Nagpur, where the civic bodies have denied permission for liquor shops to open.According to excise commissioner Kantilal Umap, the order is to prevent people from crowding outside shops. “In view of the coronavirus-enforced lockdown, we want people to remain at home and avoid coming in contact with each other. This [order] will prevent people from lining outside the shops,” said Umap.He added, “Liquor shops in Mumbai and Nagpur, which are closed, will not be allowed to run home deliveries,” he added.The government had allowed sale of liquor from May 4. However, serpentine queues outside these shops sans any social distancing forced the then civic chief Praveen Pardeshi to shut shops in Mumbai within two days.Umap said that shop owners will have to deliver liquor to permit holders at their addresses after an order is placed. The notification also pointed out that delivery boys should use masks and sanitisers frequently.Meanwhile, liquor shop owners in Mumbai said that it is time for the government to open shops in the city. “We are ready for home delivery, but then we want some help to tackle crowds who will again line up outside,” said a shopkeeper, who refused to come on record.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/state-govt-allows-home-delivery-of-liquor-but-not-in-city-nagpur/story-XNKSrhxIBDHPdim4HuwbQM.html
13-05-2020||City||New Mumbai civic body chief, new policy for Covid||With Covid-19 case count rising, new Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) chief IS Chahal has changed the policy to tackle the outbreak, including new testing protocols that clarify who is allowed to get tested and who isn’t, fewer but stricter containment zones, mapping of high-risk zones within every ward and reshuffling of responsibility given to top bureaucrats from the civic body and the state in the BMC’s war room. Chahal took over from former municipal commissioner Praveen Pardeshi on Friday. Most decisions were taken on Saturday, during Chahal’s first meeting at the BMC headquarters.‘WATERTIGHT’ CONTAINMENT POCKETS Chahal has called for ‘watertight containment zones’ and directed all ward officers to map high-risk areas within their containment zones. He has also asked for slum and congested areas to be targeted. With a new containment policy likely to be introduced this week, the number of containment zones in the city will drop, but rules of movement within them will become stricter.“Currently, each building where a Covid-19 positive case is found is a containment zone. That is how Mumbai reported over 2,500 containment zones. This created panic and restlessness among residents. Now all ward officers have been asked to identify areas that can become containment zones and seal them completely,” a senior civic officer said.In Dharavi, the BMC on Tuesday identified 15 to 20 high-risk ‘containment pockets’. The area currently has 213 containment zones. Kiran Dighavkar, assistant commissioner of G-North ward, said, “The municipal commissioner has asked all ward officers to have a self-management approach towards containment pockets. I am merging my containment zones into key high-risk areas. These will be completely locked in.” Dighavkar is also identifying local community leaders such as corporators and member of legislative assembly (MLAs) who can be incharge of management, distribution of essential supplies and fever clinics. High-risk zones within containment zones are being mapped in all wards with a large slum population, such as Kurla and Bandra East, Wadala, Andheri, Malad, Byculla and Worli’s chawls.COVID-19 TESTINGWithin this week, the BMC is likely to release new testing protocols. A senior civic officer said, “The new civic chief is of the opinion that the testing protocols have changed too many times, in some cases owing to directives from the Centre.” The civic body is likely to strictly follow the ICMR protocol. “The testing protocol will be like a manual, and the municipal commissioner wants it to eliminate confusion about who can be tested and who cannot,” said a senior officer.The new testing policy is likely to allow testing of high-risk contacts of a positive patient between five and 14 days from the time they were identified, contrary to the earlier decision to allow only selective asymptomatic high-risk contacts to get tested. Last week, the BMC had briefly introduced and revoked a policy that mandated all those getting tested for Covid-19 to remain in institutional quarantine centres between the time of collection of their swab and outcome of the Covid-19 test result. Healthcare professions feared this would discourage those with symptoms from self-reporting, due to the fear of moving to a quarantine facility, where a negative person may have to share a facility with a positive person before detection. RESHUFFLING OF RESPONSIBILITYTweaking Pardeshi’s order, Chahal has reshuffled the responsibility given to top officers working in the Covid-19 war room. Pardeshi had divided Mumbai into seven Covid-19 zones. Each officer from the war room was tasked with monitoring a zone.The war room consists of BMC’s four additional commissioners Suresh Kakani, Ashwini Bhide, P Velarasu, and Sanjeev Jaiswal, and other top bureaucrats, including Manisha Mhaiskar, who is the principal secretary of the protocol department, Prajakta Lavangare, secretary of the Marathi department, and N Ramaswami, on special deputation to the BMC. Ashutosh Salil, joint municipal commissioner in the BMC is also part of the task force. While Mhaiskar is incharge of ramping up Covid beds in hospitals and care centres and decongestion of health facilities, Bhide is incharge of BMC’s Covid war room, contact tracing and containment zones. Jaiswal is incharge of formulating a policy to relax lockdown rules in a phased manner and issues of migrant labour, while Lavangare is incharge of Covid Yoddha Volunteers at containment zones, and screening of elderly citizens with co-morbidities. Velarasu has been tasked with pre-monsoon preparedness work, and handling incoming passengers at the Mumbai airport. Kakani is incharge of the health department. Ramaswami is incharge of enhancing medical facilities at SevenHills hospital. Salil has been tasked with creating jumbo facilities for quarantine, and corporate social responsibility. The capacity of Seven Hills will be increased to 1300 beds. The BMC is preparing for the peak. Kakani, who is incharge of the health department, said, “We are expecting cases to peak by May-end, and the situation is likely to improve after that. This is the projection for now.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/new-mumbai-civic-body-chief-new-policy-for-covid/story-6hqAWcC0NefUz1sKeg6MyN.html

After getting diagnosed with the novel coronavirus disease, she got admitted at Saifee Hospital on April 17. The woman had a medical history of hypertension and considering her age, doctors were speculative about her recovery. After being admitted for 12 days at the hospital, her swab test report came negative. On April 28, she was discharged but was still kept under home quarantine for 14 days. “What helped me get through the illness was faith and inner strength,” said the patient. As per the data provided by the state health department, patients above the age of 60 with comorbid health issues are most vulnerable to the infection. The rate of mortality is also high among them. Dr Vernon Desa, director (medical governance and clinical compliance) at Saifee Hospital said, “Seeing her leave after recovering from the disease gave our staff the motivation to perform their duties more diligently. We wish her story gives some hope to other patients and encourages them to fight back.”In April, an 82-year-old woman with Covid-19 recovered and got discharged from Kokilaben Hospital. Earlier, a 93-year-old woman from Kerala became the first oldest lady to get cured of the virus in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/93-year-old-is-among-oldest-to-recover-in-the-city/story-uvSRf8Cch3DWuvrrVNL1cI.html
13-05-2020||City||Punjab liquor vends stay shut as traders insist on excise policy change||It has been over a week since the lockdown 3.0 started in the country allowing opening of vends, liquor traders in Punjab have not opened their shops even as the state was among the first to make the demand to boost its excise revenue.The majority of vends have remained shut (since March 23) as traders are waiting for changes in the excise policy to accommodate their concerns. They are demanding to compensate them for the period during which vends remained closed due to the lockdown. They are also demanding changes in the policy to link revenue collection with the sale of liquor instead of the minimum guaranteed revenue on the basis of fixed quota in the original policy. Sarabjit Singh, a liquor contractor in Tarn Taran, said, “We have paid revenue to the government from March 2019 to March 31, 2020. However, the lockdown was ordered on March 22, 2020. The fee collected by the government from March 22 to March 31 this year should be returned.”The state government has pegged the annual revenue from the sale of liquor at Rs 6,200 crore, which comes to over Rs 16 crore a day.The Punjab cabinet on Monday authorised chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh to take decision on changes in the state’s excise policy in view of impact of Covid-19 and the lockdown.Assistant excise and taxation commissioner (Bathinda) RK Malhotra said they have not received any communication yet regarding changes in the policy.There are 5,800 liquor vends in Punjab. Varinder Sharma, a Ludhiana-based liquor trader, said, “We want to cooperate with the government and are ready to bear part of financial losses. But the traders can’t be made to suffer the entire loss due to the prevailing situation.”Anil Mahajan, who runs liquor business in Doaba, said, “We will have lesser hours to open vends under these circumstances, which too will impact our sales.” An official in the chief minister’s office (CMO) said the excise and taxation department is expected to come up with a proposal of a relaxation to liquor vend owners on Wednesday.Vendors say no to home deliveryThe traders said the home delivery of liquor is not feasible as they do not have the required staff to do so and the government has ordered that only 2-litre liquor can be delivered to one household.On Sunday, Congress councillor and cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu’s wife Mamta Ashu had also urged the CM to reconsider the decision to allow home delivery of liquor in the state.133 liquor boxes stolen in BarnalaUnidentified persons barged into a vend in Barnala disstrict’s Bhadaur and stole 133 boxes of country-made liquor worth Rs 4 lakh on intervening night of Monday and Tuesday. The vend also had another 350 boxes of the same-brand liquor.

It will also ensure that there is proper arrangement for home quarantine for such patients. The decision has been taken so that patients are completely cured and do not infect others in the slum, where there is hardly any space for social distancing.A meeting of guardian minister Eknath Shinde, mayor and civic officials was held on Tuesday, when the decision was taken to restrict the spread of disease in slum pockets.Shinde said, “The central government had decided that asymptomatic patients can be discharged after seven or eight days without testing if they still do not develop any symptom and the patient are home quarantined for seven days. We decided to change this as it would lead to increase of infection in the slum pockets. Patients from slums or congested area will not be discharged till they test negative.”A research committee will be formed to reduce death rate among patients above 50 years of age.Shinde added, “TMC will bear the medical expenses of nurses, doctors and other medical staff who test positive. We will focus on increasing medical staff and ambulance facility to deal with the increasing number of cases.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/tmc-changes-discharge-rule-for-covid-patients-from-slums/story-UC8SbHScUJSuUfugAYHJ1I.html
13-05-2020||Delhi||100 staff at Rohini hospital tested Covid positive over one month||At least 100 healthcare workers from the 500-bed Baba Saheb Ambedkar hospital in Rohini, the biggest tertiary-care hospital in Northwest Delhi, have tested positive for coronavirus disease (Covid-19) over the last one month.“So far, 106 hospital staff have tested positive for the infection, of which 21 are doctors and 50 are contractual employees,” said an official from the hospital, on condition of anonymity. Around 250 hospital workers who were traced as contacts of the positive cases, were also put under quarantine, including the medical director of the hospital Dr MM Kohli.“Many have already completed their quarantine and have joined back work,” the official said.Around 500 healthcare workers have tested positive for the infection in Delhi. This means around 6.5% of all the cases recorded in the city are among the healthcare workers.When the first batch of hospital staff started testing positive at Baba Saheb Ambedkar hospital, the administration began a testing drive. “We tested many of our healthcare workers after we detected the infection initially in some of our staff; many people who were asymptomatic also tested positive. The exact source of the infection cannot be detected. There are several containment zones around the hospital and many people from these areas come to the hospital for treatment,” the official said.The hospital is still running its routine out-patient clinics and emergency department.To reduce the risk of infection, the hospital has a screening point at all the entrances from where any person who might have Covid-19 has to follow a clearly demarcated path to go to the testing and isolation centre. Anyone who tests positive is referred to the dedicated Covid-19 Lok Nayak hospital.In the neighbouring 100-bed Babu Jagjivan Ram Memorial hospital, 75 hospital staff had tested positive for the infection late last month. The hospital is located in Jahangirpuri amid six containment zones.Many district officials had raised the issue in April that hospitals were becoming hotspots for new infection.At All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), 62 hospital staff have tested positive so far. “This is since the infections started being reported in the hospital. Many of these people have already recovered and joined work. Thus, there hasn’t been any major impact on medical services,” said Dr DK Sharma, medical superintendent, AIIMS.The first cluster of infections in hospital had been discovered at the Delhi State Cancer Institute (DSCI) in the beginning of April where 26 hospital staff had tested positive for the infection along with four patients and one of their family members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/100-staff-at-rohini-hospital-tested-covid-positive-over-one-month/story-ZWOIY0d8JcBnOPa9P5GHsO.html

13-05-2020||Delhi||Delhi HC flags security concerns over liquor home delivery, lets govts take final call||The Delhi high court on Tuesday expressed concern over a suggestion that alcohol be home-delivered through food delivery platforms, saying such a move would be “fraught with security and safety issues.” The court refused to pass an order on petitions seeking regulation of the sale of alcohol and left it to the Centre and the Delhi government to decide.Home delivery of alcohol, distribution of which till now has largely been in the hands of the state, would also increase the risk of adulteration of alcohol, resulting in possible loss of life, the court said. The possibility of alcohol being snatched during transit to the homes of consumers cannot be ruled out, .said a bench of justice Rajiv Sahai Endlaw and justice Sangita Dhingra Sehgal. The court was hearing a bunch of pleas that had sought regulation of the sale alcohol and home delivery to maintain social distancing and avoiding overcrowding at liquor stores in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic. When liquor sales resumed n the capital earlier this month for the first time since the lockdown came into effect, long lines formed at liquor stores and buyers jostled each other, ignoring the social distancing norms put in place to prevent the spread of the disease.The court asked the authorities to consider the suggestions like online sale of alcohol, discussed during the hearing of several petitions against the crowding outside liquor vends. It noted the submission of the Delhi government which submitted that even the E-coupon scheme of liquor selling had not been successful because the holders of these coupons needed to spend considerable time at liquor stores, which leads to crowding“We need time to study the order and seek legal opinion on the way ahead,” a senior official in the Delhi government said, requesting anonymity.Standing counsel of the Delhi government, Ramesh Singh, told the court that the rules framed under the Excise Acts in force now do not permit the online sale of liquor. He stated that all the vends could not be permitted to reopen because of restrictions already in force under the directions of the Centre. The court also noted that the possibility of deployment of police personnel outside each liquor vend to maintain order had also been discussed, but the conclusion was that it was not a solution to the problem.The bench said any delay on the part of the Centre and the Delhi government in coming up with a solution “can exacerbate the problem of crowding outside liquor shops” and would increase the probability of Covid-19 spreading.“Moreover, it is not as if the problem is of a permanent nature, solution whereof can be devised at leisure. The problem is perhaps of a few days more in as much as once the patrons of alcohol are satisfied that there would be no further closure, the crowding outside liquor shops is likely to disappear,” the high court said in a nine-page order.Its asked the authorities to take a decision at the earliest “so that more damage than has already been done is not caused and so that the decision taken serves the need of the hour”.During the hearing, standing counsel Singh told the court that instructions had been issued by the Delhi government to liquor vends to ensure social distancing by having separate queues for those with E-tokens and those without. The bench said the instructions had been issued “without regard to the location and position of the liquor vends”. “It appears to us that considering the location and position of most of the liquor vends in the city, it is not possible to maintain social distancing as has been prescribed and the instructions stated to have been issued will not serve any purpose and will remain on paper only,” the judges observed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-hc-flags-security-concerns-over-liquor-home-delivery-lets-govts-take-final-call/story-vt0WHAWTJZhdvLDwffcZTI.html
13-05-2020||Delhi||Quarantine can go beyond 14 days as pathogen new, says Delhi High Court||The Delhi high court has said the period of home quarantine linked to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cannot be limited to 14 days, with there being no certainty over the virulence of the pathogen, even as it added that a person who doesn’t display symptoms and hasn’t tested positive can ask authorities for an explanation over being kept in quarantine beyond two weeks.The order came after a petition was filed by a person who was put in quarantine from midnight of March 24-25, when he first had contact with a delivery person who tested positive, till April 28 – about 30 days. The petition said the man did not test positive for the disease within 14 days from being quarantined.Justice C Hari Shankar said that so far, there was no certainty of opinion regarding the extent of the virulence of the virus, its actual period of gestation, the time taken for symptoms, or for how long a person remains a potential source of infection.In a judgment passed on Monday, justice Hari Shankar said the court was “unwilling to hold that in each and in every case, the period of home quarantine must stand limited to 14 days, and no more” while also observing that unjustified quarantine also has “deleterious civil consequences”.“…this court is of the opinion that, at this juncture, the interests of justice would be abundantly protected by a direction, to the effect that if any person, who does not display COVID-2019 symptoms, and has not tested positive for the COVID2019 virus, is home quarantined for over 14 days, he shall have a right to represent to the authorities against such continued quarantine and, if he so represents, the authorities would be bound either to lift the quarantine forthwith, or to explain, to the person concerned, as expeditiously as possible and without any undue delay, the reason for keeping him in home quarantine for over 14 days,” the court said in a 22-page judgment.The Delhi government’s counsel said that in the case of the petitioner, photojournalist Amit Bhargava, the medical team engaged for listing cases was under pressure as even a single case left untraced could turn an entire locality into a hot spot. The government submitted that a “Home Under Quarantine” notice was pasted as per the contact history tracing and information of exposure received from the authorities. It was submitted that in the process of keeping the petitioner safe, the pasting of HQ notice was highly in his own interests.Advocate Shyel Trehan, appearing for the petitioner, contended that the people who were under home quarantine were unaware of the officer who was required to be contacted in case of any exigency during the home quarantine.Following this, the counsel for the Delhi government, advocate Shobhana Takiar, said that a helpline number will be displayed on the official website of the Delhi government in this regard.The judge said that in formulating and implementing its policy to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic, which has befuddled the entire global community, the executive administration is traversing uncharted territory.“The executive must, in such a circumstance, be afforded the requisite play in the joints, so as to formulate, and implement, its policy, as meaningfully and efficiently as possible. Absent any legal or constitutional infraction, therefore, Courts have necessarily to be slow in subjecting executive action, taken in the context of the COVID 2019 crisis, to searching judicial scrutiny,” the court said.“Delhi Government strictly follows the guidelines prescribed by the centre and ICMR. In fact, the latest guidelines issued by centre three days ago recommends 10 days of isolation followed by seven days of home isolation for mild patients. We are following the same,” a senior official in the chief minister’s office said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/quarantine-can-go-beyond-14-days-as-pathogen-new-says-hc/story-NmzzNzdTIbJywONJJyW4yH.html
13-05-2020||Delhi||CM Arvind Kejriwal seeks public’s suggestions to ease lockdown curbs in Capital||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday sought suggestions from the public on relaxations that could be allowed in the Capital after May 17, when the third phase of national lockdown ends, while stressing that opening up the city completely was not possible as this stage given the number of new Covid-19 cases every day.Kejriwal, who was addressing a media conference digitally, said his government is also engaging with experts and doctors to get a holistic view on services that could resume and those that would have to shut after May 17.“I want to know from the people of Delhi whether or not relaxations should be offered. Lockdown can’t be lifted altogether. To what extent should we offer relaxations? In which areas? Should buses or the Metro be allowed to operate? Should autos and cabs be allowed? Should schools, markets, industrial areas be opened? We need your ideas on what all should remain under lockdown and what should be reopened,” Kejriwal said.The appeal to citizens from the CM comes a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked all chief ministers to submit lockdown exit plans for their respective states by May 15. Kejriwal said the Delhi government will accept suggestions from the public till 5pm on Wednesday, and a final proposal will be sent to the Centre on Thursday. He aid that the suggestions can be emailed (delhicm.suggestions@gmail.com), sent on WhatsApp (8800007722), or recorded after dialling the government’s dedicated 1031 helpline.The chief minister added that whatever relaxations are offered, people will still have to maintain social distancing, wear masks, and follow all other hygiene and safety norms. “This is time to stop the spread of Covid-19, but there is also a need for starting economic activities. I am looking for ideas from you. There won’t be any voting on the suggestions we receive,” Kejriwal said. During the PM’s video conferencing with all chief ministers on Monday, the Delhi CM had appealed to Modi to categorise only the containment zones, not all the 11 revenue districts of the city, as “red zones”.Delhi had 78 containment zones as on Tuesday where relaxations such as opening of standalone shops and industries, movement of people in private vehicles, entry of self-employed persons such as electricians and plumbers is not allowed. These activities are allowed in the rest of the city - which has been otherwise categorised as a red zone by the Centre. The national Capital had 7,639 Covid-19 cases as on Tuesday which included 2512 recoveries and 86 deaths. The bulletin issued by the government also stated that with 8,431 tests done on Tuesday, the total number of tests in the city has crossed the 100,000-mark. This puts the number of tests per million in Delhi at around 5,200, the highest in India.On Tuesday, several state government departments also held a meeting in this regard and various possibilities of “opening” the markets were discussed. “One of the ideas under consideration is staggering the timings of shops. Another is to introduce an odd-even system for opening of shops. But, all these are just possibilities. We will get a final picture once the suggestions come in and the consultations with experts are held,” said a senior government official on condition of anonymity.Later in the day, the government in a statement said it received around 3.3 lakh responses from the public in just a span of seven hours since Kejriwal announced about the move. “The response to the CM’s call for suggestions has been overwhelming. In Just 7 hours, we have received nearly 3 lakh WhatsApp messages, nearly 5,000 emails and around 25,000 recorded messages,” the chief minister’s office said. R1 CRORE TO THE FAMILY OF MCD TEACHERKejriwal paid condolences to the family of a 45-year-old teacher who lost her life on May 4 after being afflicted with Covid-19, and announced a compensation of R1 crore to her family. The woman was a contractual teacher with municipal corporation and was appointed for food distribution duty at a hunger relief centre in the city.Her husband, an Ayurvedic doctor with a private practice, also died of Covid just a day before, on May 3. They were both admitted in the Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) hospital. They are survived by two sons: one aged 18, who is a school student, and the other 21, who is in college.“She performed her food distribution duty for the needy on April 10, 17, and 18. But, on April 24 she could not report to work as she was unwell. First, she was admitted to the Ambedkar hospital in Rohini, and then was shifted to RML hospital where she passed away on May 4. May God give strength to her family to face this irreparable loss. We all are proud of Covid warriors like her. The Delhi government will give an honorary compensation amount of Rs 1 crore to her family,” Kejriwal said||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kejriwal-seeks-public-s-suggestions-to-ease-curbs/story-VOncxtkqTG7sDpPJukvdTK.html
13-05-2020||Gurugram||Faridabad police starts tracking people who visited Azadpur Mandi||The Faridabad Police is tracing people who have visited Azadpur Mandi in Delhi recently by picking up dump mobile data from cellphone towers over the last 10 days, said the police.This new method was adopted after a number of cases of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) were reported in Faridabad that had connections with Delhi.On Tuesday, a total of 11 Covid-19 positive cases were reported, out of which six were contacts of a person who had visited Azadpur Mandi, four were contacts of a vegetable seller in Mujesar Mandi, and one was the nephew of a Covid-19 positive patient. The total number of positive cases in the district has now reached 117.The police said Azadpur Mandi has emerged as a hotspot of Covid-19 and therefore contact tracing of people who have visited the market in recent times was necessary. KK Rao, Faridabad commissioner of police, said they had formed special teams for keeping a strict vigil in and around the city, including the vegetable vendors who were regularly visiting Delhi markets. “We picked up the data of people through their call logs, who had visited hotspot areas and started to track them down,” he said.The data, saved by telecommunication companies, include location information and call history. These were shared with the police, following which the police started tracking.“We have conducted a screening of all the vegetable vendors and their close contacts. Within three days, we have also identified people who had gone to the vegetable markets in the Capital in the past 10 days through their mobile data. We are trying to get them tested,” said Rao.The district administration on May 2, had formed teams consisting of police officers, health department and other administrative officials, who visited the vegetable markets of the district and collected samples of more than 200 people in three days. Of these samples, more than 20 people were tested positive.Yashpal Yadav, deputy commissioner (DC) of Faridabad, said they have been spreading awareness and have requested people who had visited Delhi to come forward and get their tests done. “We are also sending our teams to collect samples in case anyone is unable to visit hospitals. Our mobile vans are also visiting residential areas to collect samples,” he said.Four coronavirus deaths have been reported from Faridabad in the last 10 days, said officials, adding that the recent patient was a 65-year-old man who was a resident of Sector 18.Yadav said while all the four cases were found positive for Covid-19, but the cause of death also included multiple ailments and comorbid conditions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/faridabad-police-starts-tracking-people-who-visited-azadpur-mandi/story-TVtjE7UsIqYvSm14fxgKmO.html
13-05-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram, Faridabad allow medical workers from Delhi to cross borders||Gurugram and Faridabad, on Tuesday, allowed the unrestricted entry of medical professionals, health workers and sanitation personnel to cross the borders from Delhi, said the police, nearly two weeks after Haryana government curbed the movement of people from the Capital to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).Police personnel deployed at the Sirhaul border, connecting Gururgam to Delhi, continued to check identity cards and curfew passes of commuters on Tuesday but exempted doctors, nurses and other paramedical support staff. The ambulances, which were not allowed free movement earlier, have also been permitted to cross the border without any movement passes.Amit Khatri, deputy commissioner (DC), Gurugram, said, “The borders connecting Delhi have now been desealed for people associated with emergency services and for medical professionals. We will monitor the situation closely and changes will be made only after the situation has been brought under control. Unregulated movement at the Gurugram-Delhi borders will not be allowed.”The new directions were issued after doctors living in Delhi requested the district administration to allow them as they were unable to resume work even in case of an emergency, said Khatri.Essential service workers, including paramedical staff in some of the capital’s major Covid-19 hospitals, had complained that these curbs have hindered their ability to work and have even affected the ongoing process of testing patients.Borders connecting the two cities were sealed in the last week of April and the entry of only those engaged in essential services, carrying valid passes, were allowed.Mohammad Akil, commissioner of police, Gurugram, said that they are allowing the exempted people after checking their identification cards. Their vehicles are also being checked before entering in the city. “All the vehicles carrying vegetables and essential items will also be checked to ensure that there is no smuggling of illicit liquor, illicit drugs, and migrant labourers,” he said, adding that vehicles do not need passes like before if they are registered under essential services. The police have also changed the layout of deployment at the Sirhaul border by reducing the deployment to 25 policemen instead of 50, said the police.On the other hand, the deputy commissioner of Faridabad issued fresh directions allowing paramedical staff and sanitation workers to cross the border connecting Faridabad and Delhi.Yashpal Yadav, deputy commissioner(DC) of Faridabad, issued an order, stating that they have allowed the movement of medical professionals and others attached to essential services between Faridabad and Delhi as per the exemption provision mentioned in the border closure order. “We are allowing them to cross the border and they do not require to apply for the curfew passes any longer. We salute these corona warriors for their efforts,” he said.According to the police, doctors and paramedics who have been issued Covid-19 duty passes either by the Centre or by the Delhi government or the Haryana governments will be allowed through the Faridabad-Delhi border without any fresh passes.Faridabad had sealed its five borders with Delhi on April 29, prohibiting the entry of all commuters, including essential workers, while Gurugram intensified surveillance at the interstate and interdistrict borders. Only people with special passes are being allowed to cross the border. A spike in Covid-19 cases was cited as the reason for the decision to seal the border, said the police.On Tuesday, Faridabad reported 11 new cases of Covid-19 out of which 10 are contacts of people who had visited Azadpur Sabzi Mandi in Delhi, said the police.KK Rao, Faridabad’s commissioner of police, said that most patients, who had tested positive for Covid-19, had travelled to Delhi and caught the infection there. “The movement for people involved in non-essential services are still being regulated. We are questioning people entering Faridabad from Delhi and attempts are being made to prevent unwanted movement,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-faridabad-allow-medical-workers-from-delhi-to-cross-borders/story-rnqWf5BSFCoYlKYemX3FZK.html
13-05-2020||Chandigarh||Women demand shifting of liquor vend from Rohtak village||Fed up of frequent brawls and facing harassment by drunkards, several women on Tuesday led a protest demanding the authorities to shift the liquor vend in Sundana village to the outskirts.The women, who were joined by other villagers, staged a dharna outside the liquor vend situated in the heart of the village. They alleged that the district administration and state government had not taken any steps in relocating the liquor vend even after the panchayat passed a resolution in this regard.Sarpanch Kuldeep said the panchayat had passed a resolution for the shifting of the vend to the outskirts of the village, but to no avail.“This area has become a hotspot for criminals and drunkards. Girls and women have been facing problems while passing through this part of the village. This liquor shop is a big problem, but the government is not ready to act despite villagers’ repeated pleas,” he added.Sandheri Devi, a villager, said they wanted to the liquor shop to be shifted elsewhere as women and girls had been complaining of harassment.“Three firing incidents taken place outside this vend, but the authorities have ignored this issue. This vend has become a permanent station for criminals, liquor traders and thieves. Due to this vend, young children also got hooked to liquor and brawls. We will launch an intensified stir if our demands are not met. Despite heading the excise and taxation department, Dushyant Chautala has betrayed us by not fulfilling his poll promise to shift the vend outside the village,” she added.A day earlier, women had protested against the government’s decision to open liquor vends at Meond village in Fatehabad. They had blocked the roads and urged the government to shut them down them immediately.An amendment bill to modify Section 31 (1) of the Haryana Panchayati Raj Act was passed by the assembly on November 26 last year. The amendment prohibited sale of liquor in a village if 10% members of a gram sabha passed a resolution. Under this Act, 872 village panchayats had passed such resolutions against opening of liquor shops in their villages.The excise and taxation department had received over 120 such proposals from Rohtak, which is highest in the state among 22 districts.When contacted, Rohtak additional deputy commissioner Mahender Pal said he will look into the matter and act as per the government policy to resolve women’s grievances.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/women-demand-shifting-of-liquor-vend-from-rohtak-village/story-gTeYVwF5oAB0HF6XQyhMNK.html
13-05-2020||Gurugram||Two trains with Bihar- and MP-bound migrants to leave Gurugram on May 13||Two trains will ferry migrant workers in the city to Bihar and Madhya Pradesh (MP) on Wednesday from the Gurugram railway station as a part of the special arrangements made by the government to assist migrant workers trying to return to their home states.Station house office (SHO)-level police teams are making lists of passengers as per the train schedule shared by the Indian Railways. The trains to ferry migrants are non-air-conditioned ones with 22 to 24 coaches.The trains will not stop at any stations other than the destination stops. The administration, however, refused to divulge any details about the fare and food of the travellers. Assistant commissioner of police (ACP) Usha Kundu, who is the charge of the matter, said, “The passengers will be strictly maintaining social distancing and follow all other requisite Covid-19 guidelines inside the coaches.”The first train for Patna in Bihar will leave Gurugram railway station at 9am with 1,700 passengers. “The second train for Tikamgarh in MP will leave with nearly 1,600 to 1,700 passengers at 12 noon. The train schedule with timings has been shared with the passengers,” said Kundu, adding that the government railway police will be taking care of the seating of passengers while boarding the trains at the station. The migrants living in the home shelters of the administration will be ferried in government buses to the railway station under also under the supervision of the GRP.“We are making sure that there is no chaos while boarding the trains at the railway station,” said Kundu.A tentative train schedule for the next five days, i.e. from Wednesday to Sunday, for the purpose of ferrying these migrants to states such as Bihar and MP has been shared with district administration by the Indian Railways.However, some migrants said that four trains scheduled to leave Gurugram railway station for Patna and Darbhanga on Tuesday were cancelled. The migrants were informed by the officials who are in charge of managing this exercise.“On Monday evening, we were told that two trains will leave for Patna at 6am and 9am respectively. Later, two trains will leave for Darbhanga at 12 noon and 3pm respectively. But on Tuesday, the officials told that the trains have been cancelled,” said Satbir Singh, a migrant. An official familiar with the matter said, “We were informed by the administration and we passed on information to passengers accordingly. We have the schedule in writing.”When asked about the cancellation, Kundu said, “Those train schedules were not correct. That was false information.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/two-trains-with-bihar-and-mp-bound-migrants-to-leave-gurugram-on-may-13/story-vX58G4sfwu4dEy14igtyAK.html
13-05-2020||City||Now, police to reveal faces of accused held in snatching, robbery cases in Ludhiana||In view of repeated incidents of snatchings and robberies in the city despite the lockdown, police has decided to reveal the faces of those caught for these crimes.Earlier, they used to cover the accused’s faces with a mask or a piece cloth.Police have sought locals’ views on the decision through a Facebook post. The move was widely appreciated by the residents at large.Police commissioner Rakesh Agrawal said, “At a time when the whole society is fighting against the novel coronavirus, such criminals are increasing the problems of the people by indulging in such crimes and robbing them of their mobile phones, cash and belongings.”He said, “As per the decision, we will reveal the faces of habitual offenders who are already facing trials in several criminal cases, so that the residents know about them. The first timers would be spared.”During the lockdown, around four gas agency employees were robbed. Apart from it, scooters of two women were stolen and a Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar resident lost ₹14,000 to miscreants.“Covering the face of an accused is necessary in case of identification parade. Delhi police has already started revealing the faces of hardcore criminals,” said Agrawal.Parupkar Singh Ghuman, former president of the District Bar Association (DBA), Ludhiana, said, “In case the face of the accused is caught on closed circuit television (CCTV) camera, while he is executing the crime, and he has been identified by the victim, then the police can reveal his face.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/now-police-to-reveal-faces-of-accused-held-in-snatchings-robbery-cases/story-Shqdj6IjyH9v6HpwNYGC3K.html

13-05-2020||City||UP migrants, their families start 1,400-km journey||Dashrath Verma, 28, came to Navi Mumbai five months ago hoping for a steady income to support his ageing parents in Uttar Pradesh. After lockdown, Verma too lost his job at a garment workshop.Verma, his wife and two children aged four and five, his brother’s family and his uncles with their families decided to leave for their hometown.Twenty of them started the 1,400-km journey in a tempo from Digha in Navi Mumbai on Sunday after undergoing a screening test.While there are talks among migrants about truck drivers charging anything between Rs2,000 and Rs4,000 to go to northern states, Verma said one of their relatives arranged for a tempo for free.“We carried food and water for the journey. We are not accepting water and food from roadside volunteers. It will be useful for those who need it more than us. We are rationing our food and stopping at hotels near highways to fill water,” said Verma over phone.He said they came across many people walking on the highway but cannot take them along.“We cannot help people even when we want to. After we reach home, we will get another test done,” said Verma, adding that they had no problems crossing police check posts.“The police can see our plight. It is better to be with our families rather than dying in a faraway place,” he added.On Tuesday morning, the group had reached the Madhya Pradesh border and is likely to reach Pratapgarh by Wednesday morning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/up-migrants-their-families-start-1-400-km-journey-in-a-van/story-bt7PbAwvLBZxxpLPJI7JTI.html
13-05-2020||Delhi||After a nearly 50-day gap, trains chug out of New Delhi railway station||Early on Tuesday morning, 28-year-old Bitto Raja, a labourer, packed his bags, locked his one-room apartment in Gurugram, and began walking to the New Delhi railway station to catch a train home to his village in Uttar Pradesh. The train, to terminate at Bilaspur in Chhattisgarh, was scheduled to depart at 4pm, but since public transport services have been off the streets since the nationwide lockdown began on March 25, he had to cover the 30km journey on foot.“I left at 2am and reached the station around noon. I will get off at Jhansi. My village is around 60km from there,” Raja said as he stood in line outside the railway station along with hundreds of others, who were finally able to board trains for their hometowns on Tuesday, the day the Centre partially resumed railway services in parts of the country.Despite the nearly 10-hour-long walk, Raja was excited to be going home. He said it was getting harder to find a job in the city, and he was fast running out of money.On Tuesday, three trains departed the national capital — for Bilaspur, Dibrugarh in Assam and Bengaluru in Karnataka, with a total of 3,461 passengers. A statement released by the Union railways ministry read that 1,177 passengers booked tickets for the Delhi-Bilaspur train, 1,122 for Delhi-Dibrugarh and 1162 for Bengaluru.“With the departure of these trains, restoration of passenger train services on Indian Railways will start in a graded manner,” the statement read.Railway services had been shut across the country since the lockdown kicked off, and it had been 48 days since a passenger train last left the New Delhi Railway Station.Five trains will reach Delhi from Howrah, Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Bengaluru and Rajendra Nagar (Patna) on Wednesday.Even though the first train on Tuesday was flagged off from the Capital at 4pm, passengers began gathering outside the station early in the morning, compelled by the lack of public transport. Many, like Raja, had to walk several kilometres to the station. Some asked relatives to drop them, and still others had to depend on lifts from commuters on the roads.While several passengers managed to book tickets online, some reached the station without a confirmed booking, hopeful they would also be able to board a train home, but were turned away by the police. “We do not have any cash left. We had come to Delhi to get my son treated in the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), but got stuck here because of the lockdown. The doctors refused to treat him, but I have spent nearly R50,000 on lodging and medicines. I am willing to take loans but we just want to go home now,” said Rajan, who went to the station with his wife and son in the hope of catching a train back home to his village in Bihar. He too, was turned away. Even though a large crowd started gathering outside the gates early on, security forces and the station authorities ensured the entire area was cleared and only those people who had confirmed tickets were allowed in.As people stood in a winding queue, authorities ensured that everyone maintained a safe distance from each other. Before crossing the barricades to the station entrance, security personnel gave away hand sanitisers and made sure everyone had masks on.Railways security personnel were deployed in large numbers to manage the crowds, check tickets, and to ensure passengers maintained a social distance.“Ticket-checking counters were set up at the main entries to the station — one at Chelsmford Road from Connaught Place’s outer circle and another near the Paharganj flyover. Door-frame metal detectors (DFMDs) and baggage scanners were also installed,” said Harendra Kumar Singh, deputy commissioner of police (railways).Inside the station, positions were marked for each passenger, as they got their baggage scanned and were thermally screened at the gate.“The station was clean and officials checking the passengers kept reminding everyone that they need to follow the norms for their own safety,” said Ravi Negi, an 18-year-old student, who had come to Delhi to visit his relative and had been stuck in the city since the lockdown.The chief public relations officer (CPRO) of the Northern Railway, Deepak Kumar, said passengers were thermally screened before being allowed to enter the station.“The passengers were asked to sanitise their hands at the entry gate and wear marks throughout their journey. The trains, with all the seats filled, departed on the scheduled time,” Kumar said.A message was sent to passengers, informing them that Paharganj was the only entry point into the station, he added.“We also informed the passengers that no linen or blankets would be provided, and encouraged them to bring their own food and water. Packed food and water have been arranged, but passengers will have to pay,” Kumar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/after-a-nearly-50-day-gap-trains-chug-out-off-ndls/story-VOje7vfm6t6hbtLFnKUqeI.html

13-05-2020||City||PSPCL to levy surcharge on late payment of power bills after May 10||After opening cash counters in its subdivisional offices for the public and starting meter reading amid the lockdown last week, the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) has now decided to levy surcharge on the late payment of any bill generated after May 10. However, different categories of consumers have expressed disappointment and asked the government for extension on relaxation of penalty on late bill payment as many people are facing financial crisis due to the lockdown. “We have requested the government not to impose surcharge on the late payment of electricity bills at least till September. Not even 5% industry in the state is operational currently. There is need for extension of relaxation against the surcharge,” said Gurmeet Singh Kular, president of the Federation of Industrial and Commercial Organisations (FICO).Similarly, Upkar Singh Ahuja, president of the Chamber of Industrial and Commercial Undertakings (CICU), said industrialists are going through a critical time and need the government’s support.“Rather than increasing relaxations for industrialists, the power department will now be imposing surcharge on late bill payment. This definitely comes as a burden for us. The industry is not earning anything right now,” he added.“Since we are utilising the service, it becomes our duty to pay bills on time, but the government should at least be considerate towards people at this time and not impose surcharge on late bill payment. The curfew has not even been lifted in the state and a majority of the commercial operations still remain shut,” said Gagandeep Singh, a resident of Model Town Extension.In the circular, issued on April 21, the PSPCL has extended the due date of electricity bills of domestic and commercial consumers with monthly or bimonthly bills up to Rs 1 lakh payable from March 20 to May 10 without surcharge.Along with relaxation on penalty, the department has announced several other relaxations, including 1% rebate on the advance payment of power bills, 1% rebate on the bills paid till April 30, not disconnecting the connections of defaulters during the curfew.“The relief on surcharge on late bill payment in view of curfew was allowed till May 10 and extended for another day due to Sunday. Until now, we have not received any instructions concerning extension of relaxation,” said a senior official in the head office of the PSPCL, Patiala.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pspcl-to-levy-surcharge-on-late-payment-of-power-bills-after-may-10/story-sw7Lo1QmdAwOYVdX8rZNuM.html

13-05-2020||Pune||Uncertainty around national games in Goa remains||The state of Goa which will be hosting the 36th national games scheduled to be held later this year is looking at an uncertain future due to the Covid-19 pandemic.The national games were originally scheduled for November 2018 which were later postponed to April 2019. However, due to the general election, the government of Goa ordered cancellation.Now, the games are scheduled to be held on October 20, 2020, to November 4, 2020, however, without the central government’s directives the future remains uncertain.Indian Olympic association joint secretary Namdev Shirgaonkar feels national games should happen this year.“Whether it will be happening on the scheduled date cannot be assured currently due to the Covid-19 uncertainty. The Indian Olympic association will assess the situation before coming to a conclusion,” Shirgaonkar said.The state of Goa is in a green zone which is a positive sign for the games however there will be no positive progress without clearances from the centre and Goa government.“The National Games are very important for our athletes and it will be a good rehearsal for the Olympic qualified athletes as well. If games are postponed to 2021, then finding dates for the event will be very difficult since 2021 will be a jam-packed year for athletes,” added Shirgaonkar who is also the vice president of Maharashtra Olympic Association (MOA).If national games are postponed in October, then it will bring in big loses to the state of Goa as they have almost completed the infrastructure needed for the games, he added On Saturday, Shirgaonkar had a meeting over the zoom app with different sports associations in Maharashtra. The agenda of the meeting was to discuss the preparation of Maharashtra athletes for the national games.“We conducted a meeting to plan the future. One cannot waste time in lockdown and there should be a plan for our athletes. Since everybody is in lockdown, athletes cannot come straight away and take part in national games, there should be a proper camp. We also discussed on ways we can motivate all athletes during the lockdown,” Shirgaonkar added.Union sports minister Kiren Rijiju tweeted regarding resuming training for elite athletes in a phased manner after lockdown is lifted and Shirgaonkar feels it is the right way to move ahead.“I completely support the views of our sports minister, I advised the same to the state association. We definitely need to have a camp for selected athletes in Maharashtra. We have centers in our state where we can train our athletes by taking all the precautions. Soon MOA will figure out a plan for their athletes,” added Shirgaonkar. Shirgaonkar advised players to stay positive and keep preparing for the games in whatever way they can at home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/uncertainty-around-national-games-in-goa-remains/story-TpLt280cdMzkPRNeVgRR3K.html

Some puncture repair shops and laundry stores were also open. Area residents said that they were delighted to see the city coming back to normalcy.Aditya Ghodke , a resident of Kothrud, said, “We are slowly opening in Kothrud and a number of non-essential shops too were open.

13-05-2020||Pune||In 10 days, Pune’s Covid case doubling rate goes from 15 days to 7 days||According to the Maharashtra public health department, the doubling rate of Covid-19 (coronavirus) positive cases in Pune district has reduced from 15.4 days on May 1 to 7.4 days on May 10.The rate is higher than the national rate of 10.8 days or Maharashtra’s 9.1 days, as per data released by the state department on May 12.The report also points out that Pune district needs to provide better protection for the elderly population as it is above the 11 per cent state average.The department’s report prepared after analysis of data from the district health office states that the cases will multiply every week as per the trend. From between May 1 and May 10, the daily growth rate of the number of Covid-19 positive cases has been about 8 per cent which is higher than Mumbai’s daily growth rate during this period which was 6 per cent, according to the report.Officials say that the reported rise in the number of cases could be attributed to the increase in the testing of residents. The city’s testing capacity has gone up from 1,000 earlier to now close to 2000 with the to district administration urging laboratories, both private and government, to increase their testing capacity and working hours.As per the report, Pune conducted 38,000 tests which is 3,346 tests per million population of the city and it is higher than the Maharashtra average of 1,915 tests per million population.The testing trend for the red zone in Pune district indicates that there has been a growth of 44 per cent in the weekly tests.The case fatality rate (CFR) is the proportion of deaths from a certain disease compared to the total number of people diagnosed with the ailment for a certain period of time. According to the data analysis by the state public health department, the CFR for the district has improved to 5.8 per cent as of May 10 from 7.5 per cent as of May 1. The study also states that the CFR for the vulnerable groups, those above the age group of 50, has also improved from 20.1 per cent as of May 1 to 16.0 per cent as of May 10.The report states that Pune along with Nashik, Aurangabad, Solapur, Akola, Jalgaon and Dhule need better protection for the elderly as the CFR rate for the vulnerable population is above 11 per cent state average. In case of the non-vulnerable population too, those below 50 years of age, Pune’s CFR is higher than 1.5% along with Palghar, Akola, Jalgaon and Dhule districts. Shekhar Gaikwad, Pune municipal commissioner, said that the data could be different from the real time figures recorded by the PMC. He said, “There is a likely possibility of data discrepancy since according to the data that we have currently. our doubling rate is 13 days. The data of the dashboard is prepared on the information uploaded on the ICMR website and so it could not be a real picture. Also, another factor could be that we are now testing more people especially those in the red zone. Hence, the number of positive cases reported are likely to increase, but in addition the mortality rate is also going down which is good news.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/in-10-days-pune-s-covid-case-doubling-rate-goes-from-15-days-to-7-days/story-CdIpUVrqJrnUFtuxISX2uI.html

Sadar station house officer (SHO) inspector Sukhdev Singh said that a body, bearing no injury marks, of an unidentified woman was recovered from a well in Dhandhran village on May 7. Closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras had captured a couple passing by the area. When the police inquired in nearby areas, the duo were identified as Shakeela Bibi, 30, and Mohammad Rivani, 33. As per information, the couple hails from Jharkhand and had been living at Alamgir village in Ludhiana for the past one month. During investigation, police learnt that the couple had been married for more than two years and it was the woman’s second marriage.“The couple had a strained relationship due to Rivani’s extra-marital affair. Villagers said Rivani had brought home another woman who stayed with the couple for a few days, before her family members traced her and took her back,” the SHO said.He added that the police have informed the victim’s kin, who were on their way to Ludhiana from Jharkhand.The exact cause of death will be ascertained after autopsy report arrives but police suspect the woman had either been strangulated or poisoned.“A case has been registered under Section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) against Mohammad Rivani at Sadar police station. A hunt is on to nab the accused,” he SHO added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/labourer-booked-for-murdering-wife-dumping-her-body-in-well/story-sIhIg7ZylxKNWvSJ0yrncO.html

13-05-2020||Chandigarh||MBBS intern, policewoman among six fresh Covid-19 cases in Chandigarh; count climbs to 189||Two healthcare workers and a policewoman are among eight people who tested positive for the coronavirus disease on Tuesday, taking the count of confirmed cases in Chandigarh to 189.A 24-year-old MBBS intern posted at the emergency ward of Government Multi Specialty Hospital, Sector 16, and a 44-year-old sanitary attendant from Kachhi Colony, Dhanas, who works at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, have been found infected. However, the sanitary attendant was not on active duty since April 28.Meanwhile, for the first time, a Chandigarh Police personnel tested positive for the infection. The 25-year-old woman police constable, who is putting up in the barracks of the recruit training centre in Sector 26, was part of a team deployed at the grain market and was tested positive after complaining of regular flu.The remaining five cases are from the hotspot Bapu Dham Colony in Sector 26. Besides a three-month-old girl, a seven- year-old boy and three women, aged 33, 35 and 75, have tested positive. With this, the number of cases in the colony has shot up to 120. Among the active 156 cases in Chandigarh, 75% are from the colony.The day also witnessed two people getting recovered, taking the total to 30. A doctor and a healthcare worker, both in their 20s and working in Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, were discharged from the PGIMER.SEVEN COPS QUARANTINEDSpeaking on the first case among the local force, superintendent of police (SP, headquarters) Manoj Kumar Meena, said, “At least seven of her colleagues living in the same barrack have been quarantined and they will be tested by health officials.” A source privy to the matter said four women constables living in the same barracks have shown symptoms, but their test reports are awaited.Meanwhile, the department began disinfecting the barracks housing nearly 200 constable-rank personnel. “From now on, sanitisation of barracks, and the police lines in general, will be done on a daily basis,” said Meena. The movement inside the police lines and the recruitment centre have also been restricted. Barring cops, no one is being allowed to leave the campus.A barrack can easily accommodate around 16-17 persons, but due to social distancing, only eight were asked to stay together. Last year, nearly 520 new recruits joined the Chandigarh Police force and were undergoing training at the recruit centre. Due to the pandemic, everyone was put on field duties to enforce prohibitory orders. Apart from the new recruits, nearly 900 families of cops live on the same campus in Sector 26.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/mbbs-intern-policewoman-among-six-fresh-covid-19-cases-in-chandigarh-count-climbs-to-187/story-uxH7NJZWXXBHfvB1RIEDOL.html

It is cost effective as it contains all reagents produced by us. We’ve made 1 crore test kits and have 40 lakh in store. If India can do 3 lakh tests per day,we’ll be able to support the government without any problems,” Raja Majumdar who is the Managing Director of GCC Biotech India said while speaking to ANI.Developed indigenously, one kit can test 100 patients.GCC Biotech, located in Bakrahat is engaged in preparing the testing kits in its own laboratory. This indigenous test kit includes two steps - QRT PCR Master Mix Primer Probe and RNA Template each of which is developed in the laboratory itself.Testing kits were prepared following three procedures all leads to testing quality of Proteins and Enzymes.Raja Majumdar said: “It is a real-time test kit which can detect infection. Within 90 minutes, the patient can get the Covid-19 result. The incubation period is not required for the test. Producing reagents is an advantage of the company. We are supplying the reagents across the country. We have the capacity to manufacture 1 Crore test kits per month.”Raja Majumdar further added: “We have got Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) clearance and are waiting for WHO approval. If we are asked by the State or Central government for providing test kits at this hour of crisis, we are ready to meet the demands as required. A private laboratory is charging Rs 4500 for the COVID test. This kit will turn out to be fruitful to those who are economically weak.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/kolkata-firm-develops-rs-500-covid-18-test-kit-can-get-result-in-90-min/story-YA83pH7FKCkucht2WTcKcK.html
13-05-2020||World||US meat exports surge as industry struggles to meet demand||US meat exports are surging even as the industry is struggling to meet domestic demand because of coronavirus outbreaks at processing plants that have sickened hundreds of workers and caused companies to scramble to improve conditions.Although the situation could cause concern that American workers are risking their health to meet foreign demand, experts say it shouldn’t because much of the meat sold to other countries is cuts that Americans generally don’t eat. And at least one of the four major processors says it has reduced exports during the pandemic.If companies manage to keep their workers healthy and plants operating, there should be plenty of supply to satisfy domestic and foreign markets, according to industry officials.“I really feel like the industry is well positioned to serve all of its customers both here and abroad,” said Joe Schuele, a spokesman for the industry trade group U.S. Meat Export Federation.Meat exports, particularly pork exports to China, grew significantly throughout the first three months of the year. This was partly due to several new trade agreements that were completed before the coronavirus outbreak led to the temporary closure of dozens of U.S. meatpacking plants in April and May and to increased absenteeism at many plants that reduced their output.The Meat Export Federation said pork exports jumped 40% and beef exports grew 9% during the first three months of the year. Chicken exports, meanwhile, grew by 8% in the first quarter. Complete figures weren’t yet available for April, but Agriculture Department figures for the last week of April show that pork exports jumped by 40% as shipments to China and Japan surged and exports to Mexico and Canada remained strong. Beef exports declined by 22% in that last week of April.China’s demand for imported pork has risen over the past year because its own pig herds were decimated by an outbreak of African swine fever, and China pledged to buy $40 billion in U.S. agricultural products per year under a trade pact signed in January. China also became the fourth-largest market for American poultry in the first quarter after it lifted a five-year ban on those products. A trade agreement with Japan and a new North American free trade agreement also helped boost exports.Part of the reason why exports have continued to be so strong this spring is that much of the meat headed overseas was bought up to six months ahead of time — before the virus outbreak took hold in the U.S.“A lot of these sales were made before COVID-19 hit. China had already made these purchases and then COVID-19 hit. They had actually pre-purchased a lot of this before the plant problems hit,” said Chad Hart, an agricultural economist at Iowa State University.It’s also worth noting that meat exports to China and other Asian markets include cuts such as pig feet, snouts and internal organs that have little value in the United States. The most popular cuts in the U.S., including bacon and pork chops, largely stay in the domestic market. More than half of the chicken exports to China were chicken feet. And the Meat Export Federation says demand from the export market helps boost meat production in the U.S. because more animals are slaughtered to help meet all the demand.Iowa Agriculture Secretary Mike Naig said he doesn’t think it makes sense to restrict exports because so much of the meat sold internationally isn’t popular in the U.S.“I think it’s important to prioritize,” said Naig, whose state leads the nation in pork production. “I think companies should meet the domestic market first and then be free to sell the things that the American consumer doesn’t purchase and the types of things that we don’t normally consume. That’s economically important.”Meat production in the United States is dominated by a few huge companies — JBS, Smithfield, Tyson Foods and Cargill. Cameron Bruett, a spokesman for JBS, said that Brazilian-owned company has reduced exports to help ensure it can satisfy U.S. demand for its products. Tyson Foods and Cargill didn’t respond to questions about their exports.Smithfield Foods, which is owned by a Chinese company, said in a statement that it isn’t controlled by any government and that the free market determines what products it exports. JBS declined to respond to questions about its foreign ownership. Purdue University agricultural economist Jayson Lusk said it’s not clear what role the foreign owners play in deciding how much meat is exported.The industry has been dealing with a number of production challenges caused by the coronavirus, and several large plants had to close temporarily because of outbreaks of COVID-19, the disease it causes. At least 30 U.S. meatpacking workers have died of COVID-19 and another 10,000 have been infected or exposed to the virus, according to the United Food and Commercial Workers union, which represents roughly 80% of the country’s beef and pork workers and 33% of its poultry workers.Kansas State agricultural economist Glynn Tonsor said he thinks the industry will get past the shortage concerns within the next several weeks.“I think it’s important that we note that the U.S. hog industry is large enough to sufficiently supply our domestic market and export. We’ve done that for some time. We’ve been growing volumes in both places for some time,” Tonsor said.Tyson and Smithfield have both been able to reopen huge pork processing plants that were temporarily closed in Iowa and South Dakota, which should help the industry keep up with demand even if some plants aren’t running at full capacity, said David Herring, of the National Pork Producers Council.“I really don’t think we’ll see a big problem with meat shortages,” said Herring, who raises hogs near Lillington, North Carolina. “As long as the plants are able to come back up and operate maybe not at 100% but at 80% or 90%, I think we should be good.”___Check out more of the AP’s coronavirus coverage at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-meat-exports-surge-as-industry-struggles-to-meet-demand/story-96bm6ShlTrS5Vfj4pHsUKP.html

Emergency assistance program loan to India was approved in quick response to the urgent request and immediate financing needs of the Government of India in fighting Covid-19,” Xian Zhu, vice president and chief operations officer of the bank said.According to the NDB, it envisages, preventing, detecting, and responding to the threat posed by Covid-19, funding critical healthcare expenditure that will enhance healthcare capacity in India and strengthen national health systems preparedness and providing immediate economic assistance to the vulnerable and affected groups, facilitating economic and social recoveryIn March, the NDB had approved an emergency assistance loan of 7 billion yuan (about 1 billion U.S. dollars) to China to help the country fight the outbreak.It was not only the first loan under NDB’s emergency assistance programme but also the largest single loan issued by the bank so far.The loan to China provided financial support for unplanned emergency public health expenditures related to the anti-epidemic fight, official news agency, Xinhua reported, adding that the assistance focussed on three Chinese provinces worst hit by the outbreak -- Hubei, Guangdong and Henan.The NDB was established by the BRICS countries in 2014 and is headed by Indian banker KV Kamath.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-china-brics-bank-loans-1billion-to-india-to-fight-covid-19-pandemic/story-pqQYj7CrFiHBo1FNibPwUM.html

13-05-2020||World||Early easing could push up Covid-19 fatalities by 10K, warn US researchers||Researchers behind a widely cited mortality model on Tuesday revised their projection for Covid-19 deaths in the United States to more than 147,000 as restrictions continued to be relaxed around the country sometimes prematurely. It is 10,000 more than the previous estimate.The new estimates from the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) of the University of Washington came just hours after the Trump administration’s top public health officials had warned lawmakers at a US senate hearing of “little spikes that might turn into outbreaks” because of premature reopening.The IHME bluntly attributed the “higher” projection to “changes in testing and mobility, as well as easing of distancing policies”.Public health officials and experts are urging caution as many states have allowed some businesses to reopen and lifted restrictions on public life and others re under increasing pressure to follow, egged on by President Donald Trump who is eager to change the narrative and move on. “We have met the moment and we have prevailed,” he told reporters Monday.But his own public health experts and officials have a distinctly different assessment of the battle against the epidemic, which had 82,389 people till Wednesday morning (up by 1,674 over the past 24 hours) and infected more than 1.37 million people.“It depends on what you mean by containment,” Anthony Fauci, the top US epidemiologist and member of the White House task force on the coronavirus, said at the senate hearing when asked if the outbreak had been contained. “If you think we have it completely under control, we don’. But he added the US is “going in the right direction”.“We are not out of the woods yet,” Robert Redfield, head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and also a member of the task force, told senators.Both Fauci and Redfield were among the four public health officials who testified, all remotely, along with Stephen Kahn, head of the Drug and Food Administration, and Admiral Brett P. Giroir, an assistant secretary of health.In a separate but related development, some Republican senators moved a legislation that seek to authorize the president to impose sanctions against China for not giving a full accounting of the coronavirus outbreak. “The Chinese Communist Party must be held accountable for the detrimental role they played in this pandemic,” said Senator Jim Inhofe, one of the sponsors of the “COVID-19 Accountability Act.”, said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/early-easing-could-push-up-covid-19-fatalities-by-10k-warn-us-researchers/story-ho39CUxChRSBgq2JzDQV3I.html
13-05-2020||World||No change in Labour position on Kashmir: Keir Starmer||Labour leader Keir Starmer has denied any change in the party’s position on Jammu and Kashmir after his recent remarks seeking to rebuild trust with India and the Indian diaspora in the UK sparked a welter of protest from party MPs and members with origins and links to Pakistan.Starmer’s remarks to the Labour Friends of India (LFIN) on March 30 were seen as ‘repositioning’ the party’s position on the dispute, since they sought to distance the party from that under the previous leader, Jeremy Corbyn, which was seen as ‘anti-India’.Last week, Starmer met party MPs and others, particularly those of Pakistan origin, who protested against his view that the dispute was a matter for India and Pakistan to resolve, and that he intended to focus on building “even stronger business links with India”.The Pakistani community in the UK has largely stood by Labour even as large sections of the Indian community have gravitated towards the Conservatives in recent elections. Starmer’s perceived ‘pro-India’ remarks drew sharp criticism inside and outside the party.Starmer wrote to the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB), which sought a clarification from him: “Our position on Kashmir has not changed, we support and recognise previous UN resolutions on the rights of the Kashmiri people but maintain that if we are to find a lasting settlement, to end this conflict, that can only be achieved if India and Pakistan working together, with the people of Kashmir”.His remarks to LFIN and the MCB come in the context of violence and more in London after New Delhi made fundamental changes in the status of Jammu and Kashmir in August 2019. A resolution at the party’s conference in September calling for outside intervention was angrily rejected by the ministry of external affairs in New Delhi.A lawyer with a background in human rights litigation, Starmer added in the letter to MCB: “As I outlined in my leadership campaign, my approach to international relations will be to always promote peace and put human rights first.”“I will also ensure that (shadow foreign secretary) Lisa Nandy follows up on this correspondence and reached out to you to discuss how we can ensure the voices of our Kashmiri communities contribute to Labour’s policy making processes”, he added.Indian circles believe Starmer is keen to draw a line from the Corbyn era on Kashmir as part of his bid to regain power at the next elections, but remain cautiously optimistic on his overtures so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-change-in-labour-position-on-kashmir-keir-starmer/story-9AeaEq55qtBpWQNhZs8o0I.html

13-05-2020||World||UK GDP shrinks by record 5.8% in March, harder Covid hit ahead||Britain’s economy shrank by a record 5.8% in March as the coronavirus crisis escalated and the government shut down much of the country, according to official data that point towards an even bigger hit to come.The monthly drop in gross domestic product was felt in almost all sectors - from the country’s shuttered restaurants and bars to its building sites and factories - and was the largest since comparable records began in 1997.“The sharp contraction in UK Q1 GDP comes as little surprise, but does clearly highlight the magnitude of the challenge facing policymakers,” JP Morgan market strategist Hugh Gimber said.In the first three months of the year, GDP contracted by 2.0% from the last three months of 2019, the biggest drop since the depths of the financial crisis in late 2008, the Office for National Statistics said.The Bank of England said last week that the contraction of the economy in the April-June period could approach 25% and lead to the largest annual decline in more than three centuries.British two-year government bond yields sank to a record low of -0.045% after the data, reinforcing expectations that the Bank of England will ramp up its record 645 billion pounds ($791 billion) of asset purchases next month.Finance minister Rishi Sunak said Britain was now in the midst of a significant recession. “We have to support people’s jobs, their incomes, livelihoods at this time, and support businesses so we can get through this period of severe disruption and emerge stronger on the other side,” he said after the GDP data. A newspaper said on Tuesday that finance ministry officials have warned Sunak the budget deficit could swell to a record 337 billion pounds this year from just 55 billion pounds forecast in March. On Tuesday, Britain’s government extended a costly job support programme for another four months, though businesses will need to pick up more of the tab from August. DELAYED LOCKDOWNThe decline in first-quarter GDP was slightly smaller than economists had forecast in a Reuters poll, and less than the 3.8% slump suffered by the euro zone in the first quarter. But Britain only started its lockdown on March 23, later than many other euro zone countries.COVID-19 has killed more than 40,000 people in the United Kingdom, the highest death toll reported in Europe so far.Economists said output appeared to have fallen around a fifth after the lockdown came into force.Separate data from the British Retail Consortium trade body showed retail spending dropped almost a fifth in April. Barclaycard said consumer spending had dropped more than a third.Wednesday’s ONS figures showed household consumption fell by 1.8% in the first quarter, the most since 2008.The BoE said last week the economy could rebound if coronavirus restrictions are lifted, pencilling in a 15% recovery after a historic 14% fall in GDP for 2020 as a whole.But it warned recovery might be slower, especially if consumers prove cautious about returning to their normal lives, a view shared by many economists.“The UK’s economic engine will be much harder to kickstart than it was to stall,” Rabobank economist Stefan Koopman said.“Talk of a V-shaped recovery feels like wishful thinking, and we expect prolonged periods of depressed growth across the majority of the economy. A flatter, U-shaped recovery is more likely,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-gdp-shrinks-by-record-5-8-in-march-harder-covid-hit-ahead/story-m7M2jjigVFIzNa13OoHpbM.html
13-05-2020||World||UK researchers try to solve genetic riddle behind Covid-19’s erratic behaviour||British researchers will study the genes of thousands of ill Covid-19 patients to try to crack one of the most puzzling riddles of the novel coronavirus: why does it kill some people but give others not even a mild headache?Researchers from across the United Kingdom will sequence the genetic code of people who fell critically ill with Covid-19 and compare their genomes with those who were mildly ill or not ill at all. The hunt for the specific genes that could cause a predisposition to getting ill with Covid-19 will involve up to 20,000 people currently or previously in hospital intensive care with Covid-19 and about 15,000 people with mild symptoms.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicScientists caution that their knowledge of the novel coronavirus, which emerged in China last year, is still modest though they say it is striking how it can be so deadly for some but so mild for others.It is, as yet, unclear why. “We think that there will be clues in the genome that will help us understand how the disease is killing people,” Kenneth Baillie, an intensive care doctor who is leading the study at the University of Edinburgh, told Reuters.“I would bet my house on there being a very strong genetic component to individual risk,” Baillie said. Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreakHealth minister Matt Hancock called on people to sign up to the programme. “If you’re asked to sign up to the genomics trial which is being run by Genomics England, then please do, because then we can understand the genetic links. It’s all part of building a scientific picture of this virus.”The genome is an organism’s complete set of deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, and in humans it contains about 3 billion DNA base pairs.But comparing them can be tough. There are 4 million to 5 million differences between any two people so scientists need a big sample, Baillie said. “We don’t know at a mechanistic level, at the level of molecules and cells, what are the events that are actually causing people to get sick and die from this disease,” he said.Baillie will work with the intensive care units across the United Kingdom, Genomics England and a global genetics research consortium known as the Genetics of Susceptibility and Mortality in Critical Care, or GenOMICC.“By reading the whole genome we may able to identify variation that affects response to Covid-19 and discover new therapies that could reduce harm, save lives and even prevent future outbreaks,” said Mark Caulfield, chief scientist at Genomics England. Some answers could come as soon as in a few weeks from a study of almost 2,000 people already underway, Baillie said, though it is likely that testing more people will ensure that the signals they detect are genuine. The results will be shared globally.“Your chance of dying from an infection is very strongly encoded in your genes - much more strongly than your chances of dying from heart disease or cancer,” Baillie said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-researchers-try-to-solve-genetic-riddle-behind-covid-19-s-erratic-behaviour/story-KJ6erZIRHVlx5YHasPtOvO.html

Officials have scrambled to trace and test thousands of people over the past week after a cluster of new infections linked to nightclubs and bars in Seoul’s Itaewon district raised fears of a second wave outbreak.Officials have linked at least 119 cases of COVID-19 to the night spots, which had just reopened as part of the country’s move to ease lockdown measures to jumpstart its struggling economy. Eleven of the 119 patients are 19 years old or younger.Vice Health Minister Kim Gang-lip said bringing back the social distancing rules was unlikely as long as the daily number of new cases remained below 50 and officials were able to trace 95% of all infections.“For now, we will still monitor how the current transmissions go and review whether we should reconsider our distancing policy,” Kim told a media briefing.The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC)reported 26 new cases as of midnight Tuesday, with 21 tied to the Seoul nightclub outbreak. That was slightly lower than levels reported in the previous two days and brought the national tally to 10,962, including 259 deaths.The Itaewon outbreak prompted officials to re-shutter some nightclubs and bars as well as delay the planned reopening of schools by a week, but the government has stood by its decision to ease broader restrictions by reopening offices, public facilities and sports centres.Seoul city officials did introduce a new policy requiring people to wear protective face masks during peak hours on the subway from Wednesday.South Korea’s experience underscores the need for long-term efforts to prevent new outbreaks, said John Fleming, the Head of IFRC’s Asia Pacific Health Unit.“We need to remain vigilant for new outbreaks in countries that have flattened the curve, like South Korea,” he told Reuters. “It’s easy to get complacent when restrictions ease off.” More than 22,000 people have been tested since the nightclub cluster was first revealed last week, Seoul mayor Park Won-soon told a media briefing. Cellphone data was used to identify and locate thousands of them.More than 1,200 of the people tested were foreigners, Park said, prompting the city to send out automated text messages in English asking people to be tested. The confirmed infections include co-workers, family members and students of the people who had been in the clubs.Park expressed concern the young, mobile demographic of most of the infected could expand the outbreak.“This is very worrisome,” he said.CRIMINAL COMPLAINT Authorities in Incheon, a city west of Seoul, said they would pursue a criminal complaint against one infected clubgoer who they said had not disclosed to officials that he worked at a private school.Investigators traced the man’s movements using his cellphone data and determined that he worked at a school where five students and one instructor have since been confirmed to be infected. A student privately tutored by the man and the student’s mother also tested positive, according to Incheon city officials.“If there are more cases where people give inaccurate accounts, the government cannot take proactive measures, we can’t prevent the spread of secondary and tertiary infections, and our entire society can fall back into danger,” Kim said.The KCDC is still trying to locate about 3,000 of the 5,517 who had visited nine Itaewon clubs, for which it secured credit card transactions data involving some 1,800 people, director Jeong Eun-kyeong said. They are also carrying out epidemiological surveys on other suspected areas, including two bars in Hongdae and Sinchon, both popular hangout spots for youngsters, she said. “The biggest problem with COVID-19 is its silent transmission,” Jeong told a briefing. “Nearly 30% of the new patients are in their 20s who are very active and carry greater risks of infecting others even when they’re not showing any symptoms.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-sticks-with-coronavirus-lockdown-rollback-despite-nightclub-outbreak/story-7fA3cTH195yWMsvYfYMHfL.html
13-05-2020||World||Covid-19 more than a lung disease, it can lead to blood clots, say doctors||As the coronavirus disease spreads through the United States, the doctors are noticing something strange happening to patients’ blood.Signs of blood thickening and clotting were being detected in different organs by doctors from different specialties. This would turn out to be one of the alarming ways the virus ravages the body, as doctors are starting to realise.CNN reported that the development is frightening the doctors in the US. The channel spoke to Dr Scott Brakenridge, an assistant professor on the acute care surgery team at the University of Florida College of Medicine who said that the way this disease is manifesting itself is “curious and frustrating”.He also said that in some cases, Covid-19 seems to be associated with multi-system organ failure.Nephrologists at one of the hospitals in the US noticed kidney dialysis catheters getting plugged with clots. Pulmonologists monitoring Covid-19 patients on mechanical ventilators could see portions of lungs were oddly bloodless, news agency Reuters reported.They are also worried about the age of victims skewing younger.The doctors pooled their observations, and developed a new treatment protocol in the US - patients now receive high doses of a blood-thinning drug even before any evidence of clotting appears.Clotting can develop in anyone who gets very sick and spends long periods of time immobile on a ventilator, but doctors say the problem seemed to show up sooner in Covid-19 patients as a more direct consequence of the virus.Meanwhile, a research published in the medical journal Infection, Genetics and Evolution last week said that the new coronavirus is adapting to different populations. The research was based on genetic analysis of samples from more than 7,500 people infected with Covid-19.They found almost 200 recurrent genetic mutations of the new coronavirus - SARS-CoV-2 - that show how it may be evolving as it spreads in people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-more-than-a-lung-disease-it-can-lead-to-blood-clots-say-doctors/story-cnHbjebDCNJquRqG8q9dQN.html
13-05-2020||World||Covid-19: UK economy plunges into recession||The British economy shrank 2% in the first quarter of the year from the previous three-month period, the biggest quarterly decline since the global financial crisis of 2008 even though it included just one week of the coronavirus lockdown, official figures showed Wednesday.The Office of National Statistics found that the slump was getting deeper as the quarter came to an end, with output down by 5.8% in March alone, the month when curbs on everyday life started being put in place by the British government. Prime Minister Boris Johnson put the U.K. into full lockdown on March 23, days after closing pubs and restaurants and schools.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe March figure illustrates the scale of the coronavirus slump to come, with the Bank of England, for example, warning of the biggest annual slump since 1706.“With the arrival of the pandemic, nearly every aspect of the economy was hit in March, dragging growth to a record monthly fall,” said statistician Jonathan Athow.During March, the only sectors that did grow reflected the needs of a country dealing with a pandemic - IT support, soaps and cleaning products, and the manufacture of pharmaceuticals.The quarterly decline is the biggest recorded since the fourth quarter of 2008. Since 1955, when equivalent records began, there have only been four quarters worse.Like others, the British economy is set for a recession of unprecedented proportions, with many economists predicting that the second quarter could see economic output shrink by a quarter, or even more.Last week, the Bank of England warned that the British economy could fall by around 30% in the first half of the year, before a strong recovery in the second half of the year, leaving it 14% smaller by the end of 2020. Still, even with that predicted second-half recovery, the annual fall would be the biggest in over 300 years.Much of the British economy has been mothballed over the past couple of months, with many sectors unlikely to open again for months.In addition to the 2 million estimated to be unemployed, around 7.5 million people have become economically inactive since the lockdown via the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, which sees the government pay up to 80% of the salaries of workers retained, up to 2,500 pounds ($3,075) a month. On Tuesday, the Treasury chief extended the scheme for a further four months until October though suggested that firms will have to start paying a share.Some of the lockdown measures are being relaxed in England on Wednesday, with those workers who are unable to work from home, such as those in construction and manufacturing, encouraged to return to work. And a number of recreational sports, such as golf and tennis clubs, can reopen. In all cases, social distancing rules have to be observed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-uk-economy-plunges-into-recession/story-R2mnOy2IZ67P65sX6hLk0I.html
13-05-2020||World||Trump approval dips amid mounting coronavirus death toll, trails Biden by 8 points: Poll||More Americans have grown critical of President Donald Trump over the past month as the death toll mounts from the coronavirus pandemic and he now trails Democratic challenger Joe Biden by 8 percentage points among registered voters, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released on Tuesday.The poll conducted on Monday and Tuesday showed that 41% of U.S. adults approved of Trump’s performance in office, which is down 4 points from a similar poll that ran in mid-April. Fifty-six percent disapprove of Trump, up by 5 points in the same span. It also found that 46% of registered voters said they would back Biden in the Nov. 3 presidential election, while 38% would vote for Trump. That compared with a 2-point Biden lead in Reuters/Ipsos polling last week.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicAmericans also appear to be increasingly critical of the way Trump has handled the health crisis. According to the poll, those who disapprove of Trump’s performance at the helm of the country’s pandemic response outnumber those who approve by 13 percentage points - the highest level of net disapproval since the poll started asking the question at the beginning of March. Trump initially downplayed the threat of the virus that has killed more than 80,000 people in the United States, the highest death toll of any country. He has sometimes contradicted disease specialists in his administration, promoted potential treatments that were not found effective and has accused Democratic governors of reopening their states slowly in order to hurt his re-election chances.Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreakThe Republican president has defended his administration’s handling of the crisis and has accused China of failing to alert the world to the severity and scope of the outbreak, which has hammered the economy.Biden has routinely led Trump among polls of registered voters this year. But his lead had been steadily eroding until this week. The public sees Trump as the stronger candidate for job creation, while Biden is seen as better suited on healthcare issues. The poll showed that the public was split over which candidate would be better for dealing with the coronavirus response. The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online, in English, throughout the United States. It gathered responses from 1,112 American adults, including 973 who identified as registered voters. It had a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of plus or minus 4 percentage points.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-approval-dips-amid-mounting-coronavirus-death-toll-trails-biden-by-8-points-poll/story-2r0eYyaCJFGSg1olJkXXdJ.html
13-05-2020||World||Mike Pompeo in Israel for West Bank annexation talks amid Covid-19 lockdown||US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was in Israel on Wednesday for meetings with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his new governing partner for talks that were expected to address Israel’s plans to annex parts of the West Bank.Pompeo landed in Tel Aviv early in the morning and proceeded directly to Jerusalem, receiving an exemption from Israel’s mandatory two-week quarantine for arrivals due to the coronavirus outbreak. His visit is the first to Israel by any foreign official since January, before the country largely shut its borders to halt the spread of the pandemic.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageNetanyahu and his new coalition partner, Blue and White party leader Benny Gantz, postponed the swearing-in of their government until Thursday to accommodate Pompeo’s visit.One of the key items on the agenda in Pompeo’s talks with Netanyahu and Gantz was Israel’s stated intention to annex parts of the West Bank — a move certain to enrage the Palestinians and much of the Arab world as well as many of Israel’s Western allies.Ahead of the visit, Pompeo told the Israeli daily Israel Hayom on Tuesday that the meeting was important enough to justify flying to Israel for face-to-face talks despite the pandemic and that they would discuss efforts to keep Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons, the Trump administration’s Mideast plan, and efforts to combat the coronavirus.He declined to say whether the administration supports unilateral annexation by Israel, saying he was coming to hear Netanyahu and Gantz’s perspectives on the matter. US Ambassador David Friedman, an architect of the Trump administration’s plan, has said Israel could begin annexing territory within weeks.Netanyahu and Gantz struck a power-sharing deal last month after three parliamentary elections over the past year resulted in stalemate. Under the deal, Netanyahu would remain prime minister for the next 18 months, even as he goes on trial on charges of fraud, accepting bribes and breach of trust. Afterwards a year and a half, Gantz will serve as prime minister for 18 months.The agreement also stipulates that Netanyahu can advance plans to annex Israeli settlements in the West Bank starting July 1, but that such a move must be coordinated with the US while also taking regional stability and peace agreements into consideration.Israeli hard-liners are eager to unilaterally redraw the Mideast map before November’s US presidential election. Annexation would also give President Donald Trump an accomplishment to shore up his pro-Israel base, particularly politically influential evangelical Christian voters. Wednesday’s meeting could provide an indication of how far the administration is willing to allow Netanyahu to move.Israel captured the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza Strip in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians seek these territories as part of a future independent state. In the decades since, Israel has built settlements in the West Bank and east Jerusalem that now house nearly 700,000 Israelis. Most of the international community considers these settlements a violation of international law and obstacles to peace.In November, Pompeo stated that the administration no longer believed that Israel’s West Bank settlements were inconsistent with international law.But Netanyahu’s plans to annex occupied West Bank territory have drawn fierce criticism from across the Arab world. Earlier this week the United Arab Emirates, which has close, covert relations with Israel, voiced “deep concern” about annexation plans, while the Arab League has said annexation would be a “war crime.”The Trump administration has said it will support the annexation of West Bank territory claimed by the Palestinians for an eventual state — as long as Israel agrees to enter peace talks with the Palestinians.Under the Trump plan unveiled in January, the Palestinians would have limited statehood while Israel would annex some 30% of the West Bank. The Palestinians have rejected the plan.Most of the international community opposes Israeli annexation, saying it would scuttle hopes of a two-state solution to the conflict.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mike-pompeo-in-israel-to-talk-west-bank-annexation-despite-covid-19/story-dIeOp42TfusV543R79yMII.html
13-05-2020||World||US Supreme Court appears likely to reject Trump immunity claim||The Supreme Court on Tuesday appeared likely to reject President Donald Trump’s claim that he is immune from criminal investigation while in office. But the court seemed less clear about exactly how to handle subpoenas from Congress and the Manhattan district attorney for Trump’s tax, bank and financial records.The court’s major clash over presidential accountability could affect the 2020 presidential campaign, especially if a high court ruling leads to the release of personal financial information before Election Day.The justices heard arguments in two cases by telephone Tuesday that stretched into the early afternoon. The court, which includes six justices age 65 or older, has been meeting by phone because of the coronavirus pandemic.There was no apparent consensus about whether to ratify lower court rulings that the subpoenas to Trump’s accountant and banks are valid and should be enforced. The justices will meet by phone before the end of the week to take a preliminary vote on how those cases should come out, and decisions are expected by early summer.On the same day Trump’s lawyers were telling the court that the subpoenas would be a distraction that no president can afford, Trump found the time to weigh in on a long string of unrelated issues on Twitter, about Elon Musk reopening Tesla’s California plant in defiance of local authorities, the credit he deserves for governors’ strong approval ratings for their handling of the virus outbreak, the anger Asian Americans feel “at what China has done to our Country,” oil prices, interest rates, his likely opponent in the November election and his critics.The justices sounded particularly concerned in arguments over congressional subpoenas about whether a ruling validating the subpoenas would open the door to harassing future presidents.“In your view, there is really no protection against the use of congressional subpoenas for the purpose of preventing the harassment of a president,” Justice Samuel Alito said to Douglas Letter, the lawyer for the House of Representatives.Justice Stephen Breyer said he worried about a “future Sen. McCarthy,” a reference to the Communist-baiting Wisconsin senator from the 1950s, with subpoena power against a future president.But in the case involving Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr.’s subpoena for Trump’s taxes, the justices showed little interest in the broadest argument made by Jay Sekulow, Trump’s lawyer, that a president can’t be investigated while he holds office.Trump had said he would make his tax returns public but hasn’t done so, unlike every other president in recent history.“President Trump is the first one to refuse to do that,” Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said early in the arguments.The cases resemble earlier disputes over presidents’ assertions that they were too consumed with the job of running the country to worry about lawsuits and investigations. In 1974, the justices acted unanimously in requiring President Richard Nixon to turn over White House tapes to the Watergate special prosecutor. In 1997, another unanimous court allowed a sexual harassment lawsuit to go forward against President Bill Clinton.In those cases, three Nixon appointees and two Clinton appointees, respectively, voted against the president who chose them for the high court. The current court has two Trump appointees, Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.Trump’s lawyers drew on law review articles Kavanaugh wrote to buttress their arguments that the president needs to be protected from investigations.The justice, though, seemed more interested in how to balance the competing interests at play. “And the question then boils down to, how can we both protect the House’s interest in obtaining information it needs to legislate but also protect the presidency?” Kavanaugh asked.Appellate courts in Washington and New York have ruled that the documents should be turned over, but those rulings have been put on hold pending a final court ruling. The appellate decisions brushed aside the president’s broad arguments, focusing on the fact that the subpoenas were addressed to third parties asking for records of Trump’s business and financial dealings as a private citizen, not as president.House committees want records from Deutsche Bank and Capital One, as well as the Mazars USA accounting firm. Mazars also is the recipient of a subpoena from Vance.Two congressional committees subpoenaed the bank documents as part of their investigations into Trump and his businesses. Deutsche Bank has been one of the few banks willing to lend to Trump after a series of corporate bankruptcies and defaults starting in the early 1990s.Vance and the House Oversight and Reform Committee sought records from Mazars concerning Trump and his businesses based on payments that Trump’s then-personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, arranged during the 2016 presidential race to keep two women from airing their claims of extramarital affairs with Trump.Trump sued to block the subpoenas. He is being represented by personal lawyers at the Supreme Court, and the Justice Department is supporting the high-court appeal.

13-05-2020||World||881 single-day deaths, over 1.7 lakh cases: Brazil becoming new Covid-19 hotspot||Brazil reported a new record for coronavirus deaths as Latin America’s largest economy becomes the new global hotspot for the coronavirus pandemic.The country reported 881 deaths on Tuesday, pushing the total to 12,400.Last week, the country surpassed the UK’s daily death toll, trailing only the US in terms of recorded daily deaths. The number of infections has more than doubled in the past two weeks to 1,77,589. Brazil has now surpassed Germany’s 1,70,508 confirmed cases and is very close to France’s tally of 1,78,225 confirmed and probable cases.This makes Brazil the sixth most-affected country, after the United States, Britain, Italy, France and Spain.“Certainly, the increase of cases (in Brazil) in the last several days is a case of concern,” Marcos Espinal, head of the communicable diseases department at the Pan American Health Organization, told a briefing in Washington.Faced with overwhelmed hospitals and surging coronavirus deaths, Brazilian state and city governments are lurching forward with mandatory lockdowns against the will of President Jair Bolsonaro, who says job losses are more damaging than Covid-19.Brazil’s far-right President Jair Bolsonaro has drawn criticism for downplaying the pandemic, comparing the virus to a “little flu,” condemning the “hysteria” around it, and urging state and local authorities to end stay-at-home measures.Previously, the highest one-day toll in Brazil was 751 deaths on May 8.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/881-single-day-deaths-over-1-7-lakh-cases-brazil-becoming-new-covid-19-hotspot/story-AR7ViMOIOkXJ5Lt2yKKDwN.html
13-05-2020||World||Donald Trump wants California to let automaker Tesla reopen assembly plant||US President Donald Trump on Tuesday urged that Tesla Inc be allowed to reopen its electric vehicle assembly plant in California, joining CEO Elon Musk’s bid to defy county officials who have ordered it to remain closed.“California should let Tesla & @elonmusk open the plant, NOW. It can be done Fast & Safely!” Trump wrote on Twitter.  California should let Tesla & @elonmusk open the plant, NOW. It can be done Fast & Safely!On Monday, Musk said production was resuming at the automaker’s sole US vehicle factory, defying an order to stay closed and saying if anyone had to be arrested, it should be he.Musk tweeted “Thank you!” in response to Trump on Tuesday.Tesla shares were up 1.1% at $820.44 in late trading on Tuesday.Employee-parking lots at Tesla’s factory in Fremont, California were packed with cars on Tuesday. Trucks could be seen driving in and out of the factory grounds.At the Fremont factory’s outbound logistics parking lot, where only a dozen Tesla cars were parked last week, hundreds of Tesla vehicles were seen on Tuesday.Tesla has planned to fully reopen its battery plant in Nevada, the Verge reported late Tuesday, citing an internal email. According to a Reuters report last week, Tesla said it had begun limited operations at its Gigafactories in Nevada and New York.The company, which on Saturday sued Alameda County, where the plant is located, over its decision that the plant should stay closed, did not comment on Trump’s tweet.Late on Monday, county health officials said they were aware Tesla had opened beyond the so-called minimum basic operations allowed during lockdown, and had notified the company it could not operate without a county-approved plan.A county health official on Friday said the county had asked all manufacturers, including Tesla, to delay operations by at least another week to monitor infection and hospitalization rates.Scott Haggerty, the Alameda County supervisor for the district where Tesla’s factory is located, told the New York Times on Saturday that the county had been working to permit Tesla to resume operations on May 18 - the same day other US automakers have been permitted to resume production in other states.Haggerty on Tuesday accused Musk on Twitter of misrepresenting what he had told the newspaper.Tesla on Saturday released a plan to keep workers returning to the factory safe.The measures, which include temperature screenings, the installation of barriers to separate work areas and protective equipment for workers, are similar to those set up by Detroit-based automakers General Motors, Ford and Fiat Chrysler.Trump is eager for the US economy to reopen and for Americans to return to work.He has sparred with California for years over a series of issues, including immigration, vehicle fuel-efficiency standards, funding for high-speed rail and numerous environmental issues. Trump has met with Musk on several occasions during his presidency.California Governor Gavin Newsom on Monday said he had spoken with Musk several days ago and that the Tesla founder’s concerns helped prompt the state to begin its phased reopening of manufacturing last week.States and cities around the United States are experimenting with ways to reopen their economies safely after the coronavirus outbreak shuttered businesses and forced tens of millions of Americans out of work. Musk over the weekend threatened to leave California for Texas or Nevada over his factory’s closure. His move has highlighted the competition for jobs and ignited a rush to woo the billionaire executive by states that have reopened their economies more quickly in response to encouragement from Trump.Tesla also has a vehicle plant in Shanghai and is building another in Berlin. Its lawsuit on Saturday alleged that Alameda County had violated California’s constitution by defying Newsom’s orders allowing manufacturers to reopen.Newsom’s office did not immediately comment on Tuesday. In the past, Musk has discussed opening a second US factory outside California. In a tweet in February, he solicited comments on potentially opening a factory in Texas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-wants-california-to-let-automaker-tesla-reopen-assembly-plant/story-hyOI9bWxTBQL3e9JrqiBWI.html
13-05-2020||World||Russia opposes any new US attempts to impose UN sanctions against Iran||Russia’s UN ambassador said Tuesday that Moscow will oppose any attempts by the United States to extend the arms embargo on Iran and reimpose UN sanctions against the Islamic Republic.Vassily Nebenzia’s comments at a video news conference made clear that the Trump administration will have a tough time advancing any measures to impose further punishment on Iran in the UN Security Council, where Russia has veto power.The United States circulated a draft UN resolution that would indefinitely extend the UN arms embargo on Iran, which expires in October, to a small number of council members in late April.It would strike the expiration of the arms embargo from the council resolution that endorsed the 2015 nuclear deal between six major powers — the US, Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany — and Iran, according to Trump administration officials and UN diplomats.Russia has made no secret of its desire to resume conventional weapons sales to Tehran.Nebenzia said the arms embargo is “a byproduct” of the nuclear deal, known as the JCPOA, and was temporary.“It expires in October. ... And for us that’s clear, that’s clear,” he said. “I do not see any reason why an arms embargo should be imposed on Iran.” Nebenzia was also asked about the controversial matter of the Trump administration possibly seeking to use the “snapback” provision in the 2015 Security Council resolution endorsing the nuclear deal, which would restore all UN sanctions against Iran that had been lifted or eased under the terms of the agreement.The Russian ambassador stressed that “to trigger a snapback you have to be a participant of the JCPOA, and the US proudly announced on May 8, 2018 that they withdrew from the JCPOA and closed the door behind.” “Now, they knock on the door and say, `Now just wait a second we forgot to do one little thing on the JCPOA, but let us back, we’ll do it and we’ll leave again,’” he said.Nebenzia called the possibility the US invoking snapback “ridiculous,” stressing that “for me it’s unequivocal. They are not members, they have no right” to use any instruments provided by the JCPOA.He also asked the Trump administration what it would gain from triggering snapback “because snapback will definitely be the end of the JCPOA.” Nebenzia that the reaction will be that “the most intrusive inspections” of any country which the International Atomic Energy Agency is carrying out in Iran “will cease.” “My question is, is it in the US interests that it happens?,” he asked.The Trump administration is not planning at this point to raise the controversial issue of “snapback,” said US officials, who were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.Although President Donald Trump pulled out of the deal, the US maintains that it retains the right to invoke a sanctions snapback that the deal envisaged in the event of “significant non-performance” by Iran.That position rests on a novel State Department legal argument that was first presented in December and asserts that although the US is no longer in the nuclear deal, it remains an original “participant” under the terms of the Security Council resolution that enshrined it.That resolution does, in fact, list the parties to the 2015 agreement by name, but numerous diplomats in addition to Russia have said the American argument is specious because the Trump administration has made such a point about no longer participating in the deal.Nebenzia was asked who the legal arbiter of whether the US still has standing to trigger snapback should be.“It is up to the members of the Security Council primarily, first of all, and to the remaining participants of the JCPOA itself,” he said.Nebenzia quoted a letter from Iran’s Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif to Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Tuesday in which Zarif says not only is the US is “in grave violation” of the 2015 resolution for non-performance, “but it is blatantly attempting illegal paths to reverse the resolution in actual contempt for well-established principles of international law.” Solely by withdrawing from the JCPOA, the US “has lost any right,” he quoted Zarif as saying.Nebenzia said he subscribes fully to Zarif’s words, adding, “this to me looks like a truthful legal interpretation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-opposes-any-new-us-attempts-to-impose-un-sanctions-against-iran/story-w4uDUhzCQj2f47ozUTjccN.html
13-05-2020||World||Australia requests China trade talks but won’t drop inquiry push on Covid-19||Australia’s trade minister is seeking urgent talks with his Chinese counterpart after key agriculture exports were hit with suspensions and tariff threats, but said Australia will continue to push for an inquiry into the coronavirus outbreak.Trade minister Simon Birmingham requested a telephone call with Chinese commerce minister Zhong Shan after four large beef exporters were suspended by Chinese customs authorities, Birmingham’s office said on Wednesday.The beef suspensions revealed on Tuesday came just days after China proposed introducing a tariff of up to 80% on Australian barley shipments, raising concerns they were retaliatory actions by Beijing for Australia’s push for an inquiry into the coronavirus outbreak.China, which is Australia’s largest trading partner, has rejected the need for an independent inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic.Chinese officials had said “privately and publicly these are unconnected matters”, Birmingham told television network Seven on Wednesday, adding that Australia sought a respectful relationship with China.Birmingham has said the beef ban was linked to issues with labelling and health certificates, while the barley tariffs were related to an anti-dumping case.The nationalist Global Times newspaper, affiliated with the official People’s Daily, said in editorial on Wednesday the suspensions of the meat processors should serve as a “wake-up call” for Australia for its unfriendly actions.Citing the push for a Covid-19 inquiry and Australia’s decision to ban Chinese firm Huawei from its 5G network, the Global Times said “concern over potential retaliatory measures from China seems totally justified given Australia’s heavy economic reliance on China”.Last month, Chinese ambassador to Australia Cheng Jingye warned that Chinese consumers could boycott Australian products if Australia pursued the coronavirus inquiry. Australian government ministers described his comments as a threat of economic coercion from the country that took around 38% of all exports in 2019.Birmingham said on Wednesday Australia would continue to support an international inquiry into the coronavirus.“Australia certainly holds our own, we adopt our policy positions consistent with our values and we don’t entertain economic coercion in any sense in terms of changing our policy positions,” Birmingham said.Australia is “far from a lone voice in advancing (an inquiry)” and will support a European Union resolution at the World Health Assembly on May 17, he said.Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said on Tuesday the country’s customs agency had found repeated instances of quarantine violations by the barred Australian beef companies and imports were suspended to “ensure the safety and health of Chinese consumers”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-requests-china-trade-talks-but-won-t-drop-inquiry-push-on-covid-19/story-saUP11deKBwrFr6Dh0beEL.html

Ambassador Omar Hilale, was also addressed by Catholic, Jewish and Muslim religious leaders and other U.N. officials involved in promoting inter-religious harmony.Citing an “alarming increase in violence against women and girls” as the pandemic spreads, Guterres appealed to religious leaders “to categorically condemn such acts and support shared principles of partnership, equality, respect and compassion.” He also called on the leaders to fight against disinformation and misinformation about Covid-19 by using their networks and communications to promote World Health Organization recommended measures to prevent the spread of Covid-19 including physical distancing and good hygiene. And he urged them to ensure that worship, religious ceremonies and burial practices, “comply with these measures.” Miguel Moratinos, high-representative for the United Nations Alliance of Civilization, noted that religious practices and rituals that have been curtailed during the pandemic are “triggering debates among faith communities around religious rights.” “Passover, Easter and Ramadan, the three holy occasions which crisscrossed each other in April were marked differently this year in the context of social distancing,” he said.Cardinal Miguel Ángel Ayuso Guixot, president of the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue, told the meeting that “with the whole of humanity stumbling, we must find ourselves united in facing the pandemic.” “The way forward is to find the courage to open up the space for new forms of solidarity,” he said.He invited people of all faiths to join Pope Francis on May 14 in a day of spiritual unity, fasting, works of charity and prayers to end the coronavirus pandemic.Rabbi Arthur Schneier, a Holocaust survivor and president of the Appeal of Conscience Foundation, called for a moment of silence to pray for the victims of COVID 19, the healing of the sick,and gratitude for all those on the front-lines.Schneier said faith leaders “must be in the forefront of countering the hate mongerers in our midst who have invaded social media to disseminate xenophobia, anti-Semitism, bias against minorities and conspiracy theories, exploiting this tragic time for hatred and division.” “As faith leaders we must fervently denounce and stem the scapegoating, the finger pointing and blaming others,” he said. “We must isolate the lepers of bias, heal the divisions and strengthen those forces committed to uniting a divided human family through mutual acceptance and respect and peaceful co-existence.“ “Unity and diversity, that’s what the world is all about,” said Schneier, the senior rabbi at New York’s Park East Synagogue.Recalling the Marshall Plan that helped rebuild Europe after World War II, he urged all sectors of society to come together an establish “a 21st century recovery plan to repair and improve our wounded world.” Ahmed Abaddi, secretary general of Morocco’s influential Islamic organization, the Mohammedan League of Scholars, said a great responsibility falls on the shoulders of religious leaders “to confront turmoil and challenges” including the Covid-19 pandemic and to promote the unity and fraternity shared by all religions.Abbadi, an expert in counterterrorism, said “`the radicalists and of extremists” pretend to speak in the name of religion and then they announce needs, grievances, and arguments pointing to religious teachings.“We need to face those claims and ... to respond to the expectations of the masses, how to live religiously in the 21st century,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-chief-urges-religious-leaders-to-challenge-harmful-messages-amid-covid-crisis/story-23wXBD4i5yiMfWbo4ay2rM.html
13-05-2020||World||Green or red light: China virus app is ticket to everywhere||To enter many offices, restaurants, parks or malls in China nowadays, people must show their status on an app that determines whether they are a coronavirus threat.There is often a moment of tension before opening the app on arriving at a location.A green light lets you in anywhere. A yellow light could send you into home confinement. The dreaded red light throws a person into a strict two-week quarantine at a hotel.Such controversial use of technology has raised alarm in Europe as countries including Britain, France and Switzerland look into launching their own apps to trace infections.But use has mushroomed across China, where the government keeps a close eye on the population and collects troves of personal data. Many Chinese people say they are happy to cooperate for the greater good.“We are in a special context with this epidemic, so divulging my movements doesn’t bother me,” said Debora Lu, a 30-year-old Shanghai resident.“Human life is more important.”Travel passThere is more than one tracking app in China.An app by the State Council, China’s cabinet, uses GPS locations shared by telecommunications companies -- the kind of data sharing that might not be permissible in Western democracies.It allows authorities to look back at someone’s travel history in the previous 14 days and see if they visited areas considered high risk or were exposed to anyone with Covid-19.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe app appears to have had some glitches. The health code of many foreigners in China inexplicably turned yellow one day in April. When an AFP reporter encountered a similar issue more recently, the app turned green again after he turned it off and on several times.Other applications do not use GPS data but rely on a host of alternative information.The capital Beijing has a “Health Kit” program that displays whether people have taken a train or plane, passed a road checkpoint into the city or have been tested for the virus.Police, health authorities and neighbourhood committees that are ubiquitous in the communist-ruled country feed information into the software.Otherwise, all the apps basically work in the same way. After downloading the app, users enter their name, identity card number, telephone number and sometimes a photo. The program then gives the person a coloured health code.The apps have become a necessity for travel in China, to book train or plane tickets or enter many public places, though not all establishments require them, such as supermarkets.Giving up privacyBeijing’s city government insists the apps “are only used in the fight against the epidemic” and have access to just surnames and the last two digits of ID numbers.Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreak“There is a difference between Chinese and Western culture,” said Cui Xiaohui, a professor at the big data analysis and AI research centre at the University of Wuhan -- the city where the virus first emerged late last year.“Most Chinese people are ready to sacrifice a little bit of their private life if it is really for their health,” Cui said.Li Song, a 37-year-old actor, agrees.“We are already super-connected and there is no debate on the use of geolocation,” said Li, a Shanghai resident whose app was red when he returned from a trip to France and turned green once his two-week quarantine ended.It is not so simple in European democracies.The Swiss government’s original plans to roll out an app were thwarted by parliament, which decided it needed a proper legal basis to press ahead.If approved, the Swiss app will be optional and no personal data or location information will be used, the government says.In France, the StopCovid app being developed would allow users who become sick to anonymously alert people they may have come across. It would not use GPS location technology.Britain is also trialling a new phone app to identify localised outbreaks.“China doesn’t have specific laws or regulations yet on the protection of personal data,” said Zhou Lina, a professor specialising in data protection at the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications.But the country has other legislation, including a cybersecurity law passed in 2017, that partially covers the issue and curbs abuses by companies online.These laws would not stop authorities from accessing personal data however, said Jeremy Daum, senior research fellow at Yale Law School’s Paul Tsai China Center, noting that police have “enormous power” to collect information.“Government access to information is not held to the same standards and the law assumes that internal checks are sufficient to stop government abuses,” Daum said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/green-or-red-light-china-virus-app-is-ticket-to-everywhere/story-kqOdc5evxDtmD9XNHj6LlL.html
13-05-2020||World||Chinese Covid-19 vaccine could be tested, manufactured in Canada||China’s CanSino Biologics Inc, the company behind one of the few coronavirus vaccine candidates already in clinical trials, is collaborating with Canada’s National Research Council to “pave the way” for future trials in Canada, the research council said on Tuesday.The NRC said it would scale up a production process for CanSino’s vaccine at a government facility in Montreal, and that CanSino was preparing a trial application for drug regulator Health Canada. If CanSino’s vaccine works, the collaboration could help ensure that Canadians have access to it. Local trial data could reassure Health Canada that the vaccine is safe, and local manufacturing could ensure some doses are at hand.Asked whether the collaboration would make it possible for Health Canada to consider data gathered in China, NRC said that in general, data can be shared with the regulator’s approval. “Canadian clinical trials will expand on Chinese data and provide an enhanced understanding of the vaccine candidate’s safety profile,” the agency said.A vaccine that protects people from the coronavirus could end the pandemic, but finding one that works and manufacturing enough doses is a huge challenge.Relations between Canada and China have been strained since Canadian authorities arrested Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou on Dec. 1, 2018 at the request of the United States. Her arrest infuriated the Chinese government, which subsequently detained two Canadian citizens - Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor - on state security charges. But in the midst of the pandemic, Canada has struggled to import protective equipment from the United States, turning in part to suppliers in China. A federal procurement website notes that Canada has “established on-the-ground support in China” to manage bulk purchases.CanSino and the NRC have worked together since 2013, and the company’s vaccine is produced using a cell line that was developed at the NRC, the agency said.CanSino Chairman Xuefeng Yu worked in Canada from 1996 to 2009, according to the company’s website, mainly for Sanofi.Shares of Hong Kong-listed CanSino rose on April 26 after the company said Health Canada had agreed to meet to discuss a clinical trial application.Separately on Tuesday, Canada promised C$600 million to replenish the GAVI vaccine alliance, to support routine vaccinations around the world. GAVI is also helping low-income countries respond to coronavirus outbreaks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-covid-19-vaccine-could-be-tested-manufactured-in-canada/story-6N2nGZSlLCPZQm9aA1TYvI.html

13-05-2020||World||‘Germany must help other EU states get back on their feet’: Merkel||Germany must help its European Union neighbours revive their economies after the coronavirus crisis, Chancellor Angela Merkel told a meeting of lawmakers from her conservative bloc on Tuesday, according to several participants.It is essential for Germany, as an export nation, that its EU partners also do well, Merkel told the lawmakers, with a view to consultations on an EU reconstruction programme, both the scale and the financing of which were open, the chancellor said.Germany has been the most successful large European country in curbing the spread of the virus, partly thanks to massive testing, which has prompted a partial reopening of the economy.It is in nobody’s interest for only Germany to be strong after the crisis, Merkel told the meeting, the participants said. The chancellor agreed with Ralph Brinkhaus, leader of the CDU/CSU conservative parliamentary bloc, that Germany would have to transfer considerably more money to Brussels, they added. The Bundestag would be involved in deciding on the financial aid.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicEarlier, Brinkhaus said Germany wanted to help its EU partners, but it had to know what the billions would be used for. The European Commission is expected to present revised budget proposals next week.CDU budget expert Eckhardt Rehberg painted a gloomy picture of German finances at the meeting. He warned that it would probably take until 2023 for the tax take to recover to 2019 levels, with revenues down 6.5% this year, participants said.Merkel also warned the lawmakers against getting their hopes up too much about reopening Germany’s borders, an issue her cabinet will discuss on Wednesday.Coalition sources said that officials plan to ease controls at the German borders that were introduced in response to the pandemic but they will probably not be completely abolished by May 15. The government wants to move towards normalisation in the EU’s passport-free Schengen zone.Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreakMerkel told the CDU/CSU parliamentary group there should be an easing of border controls, according to meeting participants. But she also spoke of a staged process and said France did not want to fully open its borders before mid-June.Citing French President Emmanuel Macron’s office, the Handelsblatt business newspaper reported that Merkel and Macron had agreed to reopen the French-German border.

But, again, if you’re China, neither one’s a good answer,” O’Brien said.“We’ve had five plagues from China in the last 20 years. We’ve had SARS, avian flu, swine flu, COVID-19 now and how longer can the world put up with this terrible public health situation that you’ve got in the People’s Republic of China that is being unleashed on the world,” the top American official said.He, however, did not mention the fifth plague to come out of from China. “I mean, this is -- at some point, it’s got to stop. We offered to send in health professionals to help the Chinese. They rejected that,” he said.When asked that the US is still looking for evidence about the origin of the virus, he refrained from giving a timeframe.“I can’t give you a timeframe on that. That’s something that we’re continuing to review and it is obviously a very serious concern.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage “Look, China’s got to figure out how to deal with its public health because we cannot have another one of these virus outbreaks and plagues come from China. This was a terrible thing that happened to the entire world, not just to the United States,” he said.More than 250,000 people have died due to the coronavirus and over 4 million people infected around the world. The US is the worst-hit country with more than 80,000 deaths and 1.4 million cases.“The world economy shut down, and this isn’t the first time it’s happened. This is the fifth time it’s happened in 20 years, and it’s got to stop. China needs help.“They need help from the rest of the world. And we’re prepared to help China deal with the public health crises so we don’t face this issue again,” O’Brien added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/5-plagues-from-china-in-last-20-yrs-at-some-point-it-has-to-stop-us-nsa/story-KEGvYf7nhxOkYbd1P5SDeK.html
13-05-2020||World||French Covid-19 death toll overtakes Spain’s, now world’s 4th largest||France’s death toll from the coronavirus rose by 348 to 26,991 on Tuesday, overtaking Spain to become the country with the world’s fourth-highest number of fatalities after the United States, Britain and Italy. Official data had showed France’s coronavirus casualty rate trailing Spain’s closely for several weeks, with both countries’ tolls above 22,000 since April 24 and Spain’s less than 100 more than France’s over several days last week. On Tuesday the United States’ Covid-19 death toll stood at 80,606, Britain at 32,065 and Italy at 30,911. Spain followed France with 26,920.On the second day after the loosening of a strict nationwide lockdown to curb the spread of coronavirus contagion, President Emmanuel Macron’s government reiterated that it was ready to tighten restrictions again if necessary. Government “deconfinement” coordinator Jean Castex told lawmakers that the first 36 hours of the easing had gone as planned and that the biggest challenge in maintaining social distancing as a bulwark against transmission of the virus was public transport in densely populated areas. “We must consider the possibility of reversing the end of lockdown. If certain indicators deteriorate, we will tighten measures again, possibly on a regional basis,” Castex said.By the end of Monday, the government had already banned the consumption of alcohol along the popular Canal Saint-Martin area in eastern Paris, where groups of young people eagerly socialised in close contact with each other, against the rules. The national government is also keeping popular Paris parks such as the Jardin du Luxembourg closed, despite calls from Mayor Anne Hidalgo to open them up to give Parisians - many of whom live in cramped flats without balconies or terraces - more space to stretch their legs.The health ministry said in a statement the number of people in hospital with Covid-19 infections fell again to 21,595 from 22,284 on Monday, continuing an uninterrupted downward trend that has lasted four weeks. The number of people in intensive care - a key measure of a health system’s ability to cope with the pandemic - also continued its downtrend, falling by 170 or 6.3% to 2,542, from more than 7,000 in early April at the height of the crisis.The number of confirmed coronavirus cases increased by 708 to 140,227 on Tuesday, up from 456 on Monday. Including 37,988 probable cases, up 94, the total number of confirmed and probable cases rose by 802 to 178,225, putting France in sixth place worldwide by that measure. The government has said it will consider locking down the country again if daily new infections rise above 3,000 again. In the past six days, the case count has increased by about 670 per day on average.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/french-covid-19-death-toll-overtakes-spain-s-now-world-s-4th-largest/story-yVqEDyaaFwsqDY8gvB6ZdP.html
13-05-2020||World||Russia opposes any new US attempts at UN to punish Iran||Russia’s UN ambassador said Tuesday that Moscow will oppose any attempts by the United States to extend the arms embargo on Iran and reimpose UN sanctions against the Islamic Republic.Vassily Nebenzia’s comments at a video news conference made clear that the Trump administration will have a tough time advancing any measures to impose further punishment on Iran in the UN Security Council, where Russia has veto power.The United States circulated a draft UN resolution that would indefinitely extend the UN arms embargo on Iran, which expires in October, to a small number of council members in late April.It would strike the expiration of the arms embargo from the council resolution that endorsed the 2015 nuclear deal between six major powers — the US, Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany — and Iran, according to Trump administration officials and UN diplomats.Russia has made no secret of its desire to resume conventional weapons sales to Tehran.Nebenzia said the arms embargo is “a byproduct” of the nuclear deal, known as the JCPOA, and was temporary.“It expires in October. ... And for us that’s clear, that’s clear,” he said. “I do not see any reason why an arms embargo should be imposed on Iran.” Nebenzia was also asked about the controversial matter of the Trump administration possibly seeking to use the “snapback” provision in the 2015 Security Council resolution endorsing the nuclear deal, which would restore all UN sanctions against Iran that had been lifted or eased under the terms of the agreement.The Russian ambassador stressed that “to trigger a snapback you have to be a participant of the JCPOA, and the US proudly announced on May 8, 2018 that they withdrew from the JCPOA and closed the door behind.” “Now, they knock on the door and say, `Now just wait a second we forgot to do one little thing on the JCPOA, but let us back, we’ll do it and we’ll leave again,’” he said.Nebenzia called the possibility the US invoking snapback “ridiculous,” stressing that “for me it’s unequivocal. They are not members, they have no right” to use any instruments provided by the JCPOA.He also asked the Trump administration what it would gain from triggering snapback “because snapback will definitely be the end of the JCPOA.” Nebenzia that the reaction will be that “the most intrusive inspections” of any country which the International Atomic Energy Agency is carrying out in Iran “will cease.” “My question is, is it in the US interests that it happens?,” he asked.The Trump administration is not planning at this point to raise the controversial issue of “snapback,” said US officials, who were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.Although President Donald Trump pulled out of the deal, the US maintains that it retains the right to invoke a sanctions snapback that the deal envisaged in the event of “significant non-performance” by Iran.That position rests on a novel State Department legal argument that was first presented in December and asserts that although the US is no longer in the nuclear deal, it remains an original “participant” under the terms of the Security Council resolution that enshrined it.That resolution does, in fact, list the parties to the 2015 agreement by name, but numerous diplomats in addition to Russia have said the American argument is specious because the Trump administration has made such a point about no longer participating in the deal.Nebenzia was asked who the legal arbiter of whether the US still has standing to trigger snapback should be.“It is up to the members of the Security Council primarily, first of all, and to the remaining participants of the JCPOA itself,” he said.Nebenzia quoted a letter from Iran’s Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif to Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Tuesday in which Zarif says not only is the US is “in grave violation” of the 2015 resolution for non-performance, “but it is blatantly attempting illegal paths to reverse the resolution in actual contempt for well-established principles of international law.” Solely by withdrawing from the JCPOA, the US “has lost any right,” he quoted Zarif as saying.Nebenzia said he subscribes fully to Zarif’s words, adding, “this to me looks like a truthful legal interpretation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-opposes-any-new-us-attempts-at-un-to-punish-iran/story-dg0NMHC6gfj52HfnGO9alN.html

13-05-2020||World||New York has seen 100 children with illness linked to Covid-19: Governor Cuomo||Amber Dean had recovered from a mild bout of the coronavirus and her family of five had just ended their home quarantine when her oldest son, 9-year-old Bobby, fell ill.“At first it was nothing major, it seemed like a tummy bug, like he ate something that didn’t agree with him,” said Dean, who lives with her husband and three young children in the western New York town of Hornell. “But by the next day, he couldn’t keep anything down and his belly hurt so bad he couldn’t sit up.” At the local hospital emergency room, doctors suspected an appendix infection and sent him home with instructions to see his pediatrician.It was only later, after Bobby’s condition took an alarming turn for the worse, that doctors realized he was among the small but growing number of children with a mysterious inflammatory syndrome thought to be related to the virus.New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday that New York is now investigating about 100 cases of the syndrome, which affects blood vessels and organs and has symptoms similar to Kawasaki disease and toxic shock. Three children in the state have died and Cuomo advised all hospitals to prioritize Covid-19 testing for children presenting with symptoms.In New York City, which has reported at least 52 children sick with the syndrome, Mayor Bill de Blasio on Tuesday urged parents to call their pediatricians promptly if their children show symptoms including persistent fever, rash, abdominal pain and vomiting.That’s what Bobby Dean’s family did, even though they live in Steuben County, which has only 239 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and is in a part of the state set to start reopening some workplaces on Friday.The family doctor performed a coronavirus test the day after his trip to the emergency room, but the results would take 24 hours. By that night, the boy’s fever had spiked, his abdomen was swollen, he was severely dehydrated and his heart was racing. His father, Michael Dean, drove him to Golisano Children’s Hospital in Rochester, 90 minutes away.“At Rochester they did a rapid Covid test and it came back positive,” Amber Dean said. For the next six days, she was at his hospital bedside while Bobby was hooked up to IV lines and a heart monitor. He came home on Mother’s Day.“It never affected his respiratory system, it was his heart that it affected,” Dean said. Inflamed lymph nodes caused the abdominal pain, she said. “They’re hoping he pulls through with 100% recovery but they said there have been children with lasting effects.” Children elsewhere in the US and in Europe have also been hospitalized with the condition known as pediatric multi-system inflammatory syndrome.In New York, the syndrome has been found across a wide range of young people. A 5-year-old boy, 7-year-old boy and an 18-year-old woman have died.About 23 percent of cases have occurred in children under age 5, about 29% between the ages of 5 and 9, about 28% between ages 10 and 14 and 16% between the ages 15 and 19.“This is a truly disturbing situation and I know parents around the state and parents around the country are very concerned about this, and they should be,” Cuomo said. “If we have this issue in New York it’s probably in other states.” Dr Juan Salazar, the physician-in-chief at Connecticut Children’s Medical Center, said two patients there are believed to have the rare condition, which he said often appears to present itself two to four weeks after a child has recovered from Covid-19, often without ever being diagnosed with the infection. Yale Health has said it’s treating three children believed to have the syndrome.Cuomo announced last week that New York is developing national criteria for identifying and responding to the syndrome at the request of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.In testimony Tuesday before a Senate committee on the administration’s coronavirus response, Dr Anthony Fauci said children in general do better than adults and the elderly, but he warned there is still much to learn about the virus.“For example right now, children presenting with Covid-19 who actually have a very strange inflammatory syndrome very similar to Kawasaki syndrome,” Fauci said. “I think we better be very careful that we are not cavalier in thinking that children are completely immune to the deleterious effects.” As Bobby Dean’s boisterous energy and sardonic sense of humor returns, his mom is vigilant for signs of illness in her younger children, aged 7 months and 3 years.“It’s a pretty scary thing, watching your child be hooked up to all these wires and IVs and there’s nothing you can do,” Dean said. “In my opinion, right now, I would not let your child out in public.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-has-seen-100-children-with-illness-linked-to-covid-19-governor-cuomo/story-4Mudx8jQg29LZXpyt2iL5O.html
13-05-2020||World||Joe Biden says Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to be on policy panel||Joe Biden said Tuesday that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez will serve on one of the policy task forces that his campaign is preparing to launch as he reaches out to supporters of Bernie Sanders and others on the left.In an interview with the CBS affiliate in Las Vegas, Biden offered the New York congresswoman’s name as an example of the kind of person who is being included on the panels, which were announced as Sanders left the Democratic presidential race last month.The presumptive Democratic nominee has not yet rolled out what he’s said would be a half-dozen panels addressing key policy issues. “We’ve set up joint committees together to deal with how we would deal with everything from the virus all the way down to education, the criminal justice system, the New Green Deal, etc.,” Biden said, referring to the Green New Deal, a climate initiative sponsored by Ocasio-Cortez.Ocasio-Cortez’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment nor did the Biden campaign when asked for further details on her role.Biden Says He’s Winning Despite Lockdown Joe Biden pushed back Tuesday against the notion that his campaign could be suffering because he is limited to virtual events during the pandemic, and he pointed to polls that show him leading President Donald Trump.“Right now the idea that somehow we are being hurt by my keeping to the rules and following the instructions that have been put forward by the docs is absolutely bizarre,” he said in an interview on ABC’s “Good Morning America” when asked when he would return to the campaign trail. “I reject the premise that this is hurting us.”Since mid-March, Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, has stayed in his home in Wilmington, Delaware where his campaign has built a studio for virtual events. Meanwhile, Trump has had an almost daily news conference and recently started traveling.Biden said he missed interacting with voters and is eager to return to public events, but he would only do so following the advice of medical experts.“The president should follow the rules instead of showing up to places without masks,” he said. -- Tyler Pager||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-says-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-to-be-on-policy-panel/story-44wlKKqsmlZNBttYGdc0tK.html

13-05-2020||World||Brazil’s Bolsonaro denies shielding family from federal police investigations||Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro on Tuesday denied that he attempted during a videotaped Cabinet meeting last month to shield his relatives and friends from federal police investigations.Hours before Bolsonaro issued the denial, the two-hour video of the meeting was reviewed by prosecutors, police investigators, lawyers and government officials.The existence of the video emerged after former Justice Minister Sérgio Moro last month accused Bolsonaro of seeking to interfere with Brazilian federal police investigations in Rio de Janeiro during that Cabinet meeting. Bolsonaro, his family members and friends have extensive business interests in Rio.Moro, hailed by many Brazilians as an anti-corruption hero, has told investigators that Bolsonaro threatened to fire him during the Cabinet meeting if he failed to make changes in the top ranks of Brazil’s federal police and in its Rio division.Also read: Bolsonaro fires Brazil’s health minister, calls to reopen economyWhile Bolsonaro claimed the video did not prove the allegations, Moro’s lawyer, Rodrigo Sánchez Rios, said in a statement that he was among those invited to watch it and that the contents proved his client’s allegations.The developments are important because Bolsonaro is trying to avoid allegations of misconduct that could lead to him being suspended from office for a trial before the country’s Supreme Court or impeached in Congress.Former President Dilma Rousseff, a nemesis of Bolsonaro’s, was impeached and removed from office in 2016. The far-right Bolsonaro, who has lost support in Brazil’s congress in recent months, insists he will not meet a similar fate.Speaking to reporters after the video was viewed, Bolsonaro said he never meant to imply that he planned to interfere in police investigations, but that he was concerned about family members’ safety in Rio. He was stabbed during a 2018 presidential campaign appearance.“The safety of my family is one thing. I am not and I was never worried about the federal police,” Bolsonaro said. “The federal police never investigated anyone of my family, that does not exist in the video.”He added that the tape of the meeting should have been destroyed and accused journalists of being “misinformed” about the gathering.After Moro resigned, Bolsonaro replaced the head of the federal police and the chief of its Rio division. Supporters of the president have protested against Supreme Court justices and the former justice minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-s-bolsonaro-denies-shielding-family-from-federal-police-investigations/story-nXPk1IiCVMweV93BcCxI1H.html

13-05-2020||India||Monsoon to arrive 4 days earlier||New Delhi: Conditions are becoming favourable for the advance of the southwest monsoon over Andaman and Nicobar Islands around May 16, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD). The normal date for the arrival of the monsoon over Andaman and Nicobar region is May 20.According to a statement issued by the IMD, a low-pressure area formed over southeast Bay of Bengal and adjoining south Andaman Sea on May 13. It is very likely to concentrate into a depression over central parts of south Bay of Bengal on May 15 and further intensify into a cyclonic storm over southwest and adjoining west-central Bay of Bengal by May 16 evening. It is then likely to move northwestwards till May 17 and then recurve northnortheastwards. These conditions are making it favourable for the advancement of the monsoon over Andaman and Nicobar but the IMD will announce if the arrival of the monsoon over Kerala will also be early on May 15.The Weather Company of IBM, a private weather forecaster, has forecast that the monsoon will arrive slightly early on May 31 over Kerala. “Our models and data Show May 31 as likely arrival,” said Himanshu Goyal, India business leader, The Weather Company. “The low-pressure area over south Andaman Sea will intensify into a cyclone but we are not yet sure where it will make landfall. It could be over West Bengal coast or over northeast,” he added. “The normal arrival date of monsoon over Andaman and Nicobar Islands is May 20 with a standard deviation of 7 days. This time it is expected to arrive on May 16. We will announce the date of monsoon arrival over Kerala on May 15 based on latest data,” said M Mohapatra, director general, IMD.“Andaman region is expecting early rains due to the low-pressure system that has formed over the South Bay of Bengal. This low pressure system is expected to develop into a cyclonic storm and pull the southwesterly monsoon winds early into the Andaman seas. An early onset at Andamans need not mean that the rest of the country receives an early onset. This is because several factors, including low pressure systems in the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal, and the phase of the monsoon intraseasonal oscillations govern the northward progression of the monsoon,” said Roxy Mathew Koll, climate scientist from the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology. There will be gales of 65 to 75 kmph gusting to 85 kmph over southwest and adjoining west central Bay of Bengal from the evening of May 16. Squally winds reaching 45 to 55 kmph will prevail over Andaman Sea. Sea condition will be rough to very rough over south and adjoining central Bay of Bengal from May 15 to the evening of May 16, very rough to high over southwest and adjoining westcentral Bay of Bengal from the evening of May 16. Fishermen are advised not to venture into south and central Bay of Bengal from May 15. Those who are out at sea over these regions are advised to return to coasts by Thursday.The IMD has forecast a normal monsoon this year. A few global climate models are indicating the possibility of development of weak La Nina conditions over the Pacific Ocean during the second half of the monsoon season. La Niña is characterised by unusually cold ocean temperatures in the Equatorial Pacific and good monsoon rains. Mohapatra said a more refined monsoon forecast with zone wise distribution will be issued by the IMD towards the end of May or the beginning of June.Meanwhile, under the influence of a western disturbance, thundershowers are likely over Western Himalayan region and over plains of northwest India during next two or three days. “Isolated thunderstorm accompanied with hail, gusty winds and lightning is also likely over these regions during the same period,” the IMD bulletin said. Delhi NCR is also likely to get thundershowers.Due to a trough (area of low pressure), thundershowers with lightning and gusty winds (30-40 kmph) are very likely over south peninsular India during next four or five days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-to-arrive-4-days-earlier/story-RY5wumRs8ob91FcCTObUHJ.html
13-05-2020||India||No meddling in appointing judges in my tenure: Gogoi||Former Chief Justice of India (CJI) and Rajya Sabha MP Ranjan Gogoi said on Wednesday, that the Supreme Court Collegium did not face any government interference during his tenure as the CJI when appointing judges to high courts and the Supreme Court.He was speaking at a webinar organized by Confederation of Alumni for National Law Universities on the topic “Ensuring an independent judiciary under our Constitution”.“14 names were recommended for appointment (as judges) to Supreme Court during my tenure. They were accepted and appointments made on time. There was never any difficulty. All recommendations with chief justices of high courts also were processed in time. (There was) no executive interference”, he said in his keynote address.He also said that the Collegium system is an excellent method for appointing judges to the high courts and the Supreme Court and it also helps keep in check executive interference when it comes to judicial appointments.“My experience with the collegium is that it is a sure way of keeping the executive out of the appointment process. The executive has got an equal role though the judicial voice is the ultimate voice”, he said. Gogoi was also of the view that protection and immunity afforded to judges should be strengthened so that they can perform their duties fearlessly. The vulnerability attached to the office of a judge dissuades young lawyers from taking up offers to become judge, he said.“The scheme for protection of judge needs to be strengthened. Young lawyers are not keen to be judges. The office of the judge of a high court has been made so vulnerable that a lawyer is happy to continue as a lawyer. Don’t forget the sacrifice a lawyer makes to become a judge”, Gogoi said.He was also critical of a “group” of activists and media who, he alleged, have set benchmarks for judges to be considered independent. Judges are attacked if they do not confirm to the standards set by them and such tendencies will sound the death knell for an independent judiciary, Gogoi said.“Activists, web portals, some mainstream media (organizations), this is one group that has laid down ‘identification marks’ for who is an ‘independent judge’. A judge, (according to them), should be anti-authoritarian, eloquent on issues like rich-poor divide, oppression of marginalized and suppression of fundamental rights. If judges don’t conform to these expectations, they are attacked. This is destructive of the independence of the judiciary”, he said.Justice Gogoi created quite a furore when he accepted Rajya Sabha nomination a mere four months into his retirement from the Supreme Court. On the issue of post-retirement jobs, Gogoi in response to a question from the audience pointed out that there are judges who take to arbitrations after retirement while another group of judges talk about judicial independence and freedom of speech after demitting office.“You talk about post-retirement engagements as compromising judicial independence. What about those other two categories.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-meddling-in-appointing-judges-in-my-tenure-gogoi/story-Ll5ES6aR4sfRDDWCzN9G2L.html
13-05-2020||India||Security situation in Kashmir stable but fragile: Lt Gen B S Raju||There has been an escalation in infiltration attempts from across the Line of Control (LoC) into Jammu & Kashmir and a surge in militant violence there. Lt Gen B S Raju, the General Officer Commanding of Srinagar-based 15th Corps, spoke to Ramesh Vinayak about the security challenges in the Valley. Edited excerpts:What is your assessment of the security situation?The situation is stable but fragile. Precautionary and pre-emptive measures are being taken for the safety and security of people, and these have been instrumental in saving innocent lives. Post-Pulwama [attack in 2019], we have successfully neutralised the top local commanders of various terrorist outfits, thus resulting in a leadership void. Many overground workers, who were providing logistics and other material support to terrorists have been apprehended...How have the dynamics of Pakistan’s cross-LoC support to terrorism changed? Pakistan has consistently found ways and means to further its agenda of fomenting terror in the Valley. It persists in doing that. Numerous intrusion attempts have been foiled and the Pakistan army is constantly resorting to ceasefire violations to support the terrorists’ infiltration.What has been the outcome of anti-militancy operations since the nullification of the Constitution’s Article 370?Militancy has since been on a sharp decline due to our persistent efforts. We had anticipated that Pakistan will increase its efforts to cause turmoil in Kashmir. In spite of the best efforts of Pakistan-sponsored proxies, there has been no loss of civilian life in security operations. That, in fact, has been the hallmark of efforts of all stakeholders for the maintenance of peace in Kashmir.What is the state of militant outfits active in Kashmir?We work on concepts and not numbers. And the concept is the constant attempts by Pakistan to infiltrate terrorists and war-like stores to commit sensational terrorist activities. Over the past year, the leadership of all terrorist organisations, including Hizbul Mujahideen, Lashkar-e-Taiba, Ansar Ghazwat-ul Hind and Jaish-e-Mohammed, has been effectively targeted and eliminated. There is now a definite leadership void.The number of terrorists presently operating in the Valley has also greatly dwindled owing to the reduced recruitment and the recent successes in the counter-terrorist operations. In all operations, we extend every opportunity to local terrorists to return. Halfway through, the encounters are halted and the parents or society elders are involved to urge the trapped local terrorist to return. We call it ‘Operation MAA’ where the mothers appeal to their sons gone astray, and we have been successful many times..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/security-situation-in-kashmir-stable-but-fragile-lt-gen-b-s-raju/story-NaDqZOtHXtbGRdKutlTU2O.html
13-05-2020||India||Study explores drivers of death terms||The shock and impact of a crime on the collective conscience of society was a major reason cited by trial courts in Delhi while imposing death sentence on convicts, according to a report by research organization Project 39A of National Law University, Delhi . The study also revealed blatant non-compliance by the trial courts with the sentencing framework laid down by the Supreme Court in its 1980 judgment in Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab, where a Constitution bench of the Supreme Court was called upon to decide the constitutional validity of the capital punishment.The report titled ‘Death Penalty Sentencing in Trial Courts’, which will be published on May 15, analysed 215 judgments from three states , 43 from Delhi, 90 from Maharashtra and 82 from Madhya Pradesh, in which trial courts imposed death sentence between 2000 and 2015. Out of the 43 cases in Delhi in which death sentence was handed down between 2000 and 2015, trial courts invoked the impact of the crime on society’s collective conscience in 31 cases (72%) as grounds to send convicts to death row. In Madhya Pradesh, the said ground was used in 43% cases (35 out of 82) while in Maharashtra the figure stood at 51% (46 of 90 cases).‘Collective conscience of society’ as a ground to justify death penalty was first used by the Supreme Court in the 1983 judgment of Machhi Singh v. State of Punjab. In that case, the court held that when “collective conscience of society is shocked, it will expect the holders of the judicial power centre to inflict death penalty”.It was, however, most famously used by the top court in its 2005 judgment in the Parliament attack case in which it awarded capital punishment to convict, Afzal Guru. Collective conscience found its most recent endorsement in the 2017 judgment of the Supreme Court in the December 2012 Delhi gang rape case of Mukesh v. State of NCT of Delhi.But what is collective conscience of society?“It is an amorphous term. It has become a catch phrase in Delhi. Nobody really understands what it means. It is part of the mindlessness of death sentencing. It is not possible to judicially determine what it means. By trying to do that, courts are causing violence to the Bachan Singh framework”, said senior counsel Rebecca John.In the case of Bachan Singh, the Supreme Court formulated a sentencing framework to be followed for imposing death penalty. It required the weighing of aggravating and mitigating circumstances relating to both the circumstances of the offence and the offender, to decide whether a person should be sentenced to death or given life imprisonment.According to the Bachan Singh judgment, for a case to be eligible for the death sentence, the aggravating circumstances must outweigh the mitigating circumstances.“Machhi Singh is a 3-judge bench judgment and it is per incuriam (in ignorance of law) as it does not confirm to Bachan Singh which is a 5-judge bench judgment. It is the Supreme Court itself which has created this confusion. The fact is that ‘collective conscience cry’ was not part of Bachan Singh framework. It has been specifically acknowledged in Bariyar’s case (Santosh Kumar Satishbhushan Bariyar v. State of Maharashtra) wherein it was said that judges have no way of reliably determining what is “collective conscience”, John added.The most glaring aspect highlighted by Project 39A’s report was regarding the non-consideration of mitigating factors while sentencing accused.As per the report, no mitigating circumstances were mentioned in 42% of death penalty cases (18 of 43 cases) in Delhi. The number was 62% (51 of 82 cases) in Madhya Pradesh and 47% (42 of 90 cases) in Maharashtra.The Bachan Singh judgement recognized the age of the accused as a relevant mitigating circumstance. But 37% of the prisoners sentenced to death in the three states were between 18-25 years of age.One of the most important aspects of the sentencing framework laid down in the Bachan Singh judgement is to consider whether the alternative punishment of life imprisonment can be “unquestionably foreclosed.” Only then can death penalty be imposed.Despite the same, trial courts in the three states discussed life imprisonment as an alternative only in 26.6% cases before imposing death penalty. It was discussed in 8 out of 43 cases in Delhi, 22 out of 82 cases in MP and 27 out of 90 in Maharashtra. In all cases where it was discussed as an alternative, it was dismissed on the ground of brutality of the crime. “This study shows that the death penalty sentencing framework has completely collapsed. The utter inconsistency, confusion and arbitrariness in the Supreme Court’s death penalty jurisprudence has had a devastating impact on the sentencing process in the trial courts. There is barely anything common between the law laid down by a 5-judge bench in Bachan Singh and what passes for sentencing hearings in our courts”, Dr. Anup Surendranath, executive director of Project 39A said.In a total of 211 out of the 215 cases across the three states, 44% cases saw sentencing on the same day as the conviction. This concern was rather acute in Madhya Pradesh where same-day sentencing was observed in 76.9% of the cases.Maharashtra saw it in 34.4 percent of the cases, but 57% of the cases saw sentencing within 24 hours of conviction. Delhi fared better relatively with 53.4% of sentencing hearings taking place at least one week after the conviction.This, the study said, has an obvious impact on the nature and quality of arguments that were presented before the court.Another significant aspect highlighted in the report was regarding how trial courts failed to consider individual roles of the accused in the crime when sentencing an accused in a case involving more than one convict.In 17 cases out of 82 in Madhya Pradesh which involved more than one person sentenced to death, individual roles in crime was considered during sentencing only in five cases. Individual mitigating circumstances were considered only in one case in the state.In Maharashtra, in the 23 cases out of 90 that involved more than one person sentenced to death, individual roles in crimes and individual mitigating circumstances were considered during sentencing in 16 and 4 cases respectively.12 cases out of 43 in Delhi involved more than one person sentenced to death. However, individual role in crime and individual mitigating circumstances were considered during sentencing only in 2 and 4 cases respectively.The failure to consider individual role and individual mitigating circumstances of the four convicts in the 2012 Delhi gang rape case was highlighted by senior advocate Raju Ramachandran who served as amicus curiae (friend of the court) in the matter before the Supreme Court.Ramachandran’s arguments in this regard had led to top court rehearing arguments on sentencing in detail before it confirmed the death penalty handed down by the trial court to the four convicts in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/study-explores-drivers-of-death-terms/story-75XkcDAslN9R6zvqVIPobN.html
13-05-2020||India||Army examining proposal to allow youngsters to serve for three years||NEW DELHI: The Indian Army is examining a proposal that seeks to allow the country’s youth to serve the military for three years under a new “tour of duty” (ToD) model similar to the short-service commission that allows officers to serve for 10 to 14 years, two army officers familiar with the move said on Wednesday.If the proposal is accepted, the army could implement the ToD model --- essentially an internship after military training --- on trial basis for both officers and other ranks in a limited number of vacancies, said one of the officers cited above.“The proposal is a shift from the concept of permanent service towards an internship or temporary experience of military life,” said the second officer cited above.The proposal, reviewed by Hindustan Times, stressed that the internship model would result in savings for the organisation. It said it will also brighten the prospects of the ToD optees in the corporate world.“The cumulative cost of pre-commission training, pay/allowances, proposed severance packages, leave encashment and other costs is nearly Rs 5.12 crore and Rs 6.83 crore for short-service commissioned (SSC) officers released after 10 and 14 years of service. However, similar costs for those released after three years will be just Rs 80 to Rs 85 lakh,” the proposal stated. It says the ToD model would eventually result in significant reduction in salary and pension budgets, too. The proposal cites a survey that has indicated that corporate houses would prefer employing individuals who have been trained by the military and join them at the age of 26-27 after a three-year ToD rather than raw college graduates.“Many corporates have indicated that ToD officers would also be preferable to the current SSC workforce joining them at the age of 33-34 after 10 years of service. The ToD concept will become attractive if seen by the youth as a vehicle which boosts their subsequent career in the government or the corporate world,” the proposal said.The ToD model, however, will not be the same as conscription or compulsory military service. Army spokesperson Colonel Aman Anand said if approved, it will be totally voluntary and there will be no dilution of selection criteria. “This is an ideal opportunity for those individuals who do not want to make defence services their permanent vocation, but still want to experience the thrill and adventure of the military profession and the glamour of donning the uniform,” the proposal said.But what about combat skills, experience and preparedness of the ToD cadre to go to war?“This argument can be negated with the demonstrated performance of our officers and jawans with less than three years service in the Kargil war. If the ToD officers/jawans undergo the same training (for nine months) as the regular officers/other ranks, then their commitment, dedication and performance should not be in any doubt,” the proposal added.Former army vice chief Lieutenant General AS Lamba (retd) said the ToD model was a laudable idea to fill the critical shortfall of young officers on the assumption that performance of officers with three years of service has been extremely good.Lamba, however, said, he saw two challenges. “One, the selection of suitable volunteers from the civil environment for this type of limited engagement who would take much longer to motivate than train. And secondly, training them for critical front-line combat deployments,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-examining-proposal-to-allow-youngsters-to-serve-for-three-years/story-1e1rDsAegRn8X8VUugunvM.html
13-05-2020||India||Supreme Court exempts lawyers from wearing coats, gowns||Supreme Court lawyers were on Wednesday exempted from wearing gowns and coats while attending the virtual hearings in view of medical advice that there is a greater possibility of the Covid-19 spread through these robes. Officials said a circular issued in this regard has been implemented with an immediate effect and the exemption will remain in force till the medical exigency exists. “Medical advice to beat the spread of Covid-19 requires clothes to be washed regularly. Since gowns, robes and coats cannot be washed daily, the possibility of the virus spreading through their daily use cannot be ruled out,” said a Supreme Court Registry official on condition of anonymity. A similar exemption from wearing coats and ties was extended to the Supreme Court officials on April 24.“... considering the medical advice, as a precautionary measure to contain spread of Coronavirus (COVID-19) infection under the prevailing conditions, the Competent Authority has been pleased to direct that the advocates may wear ‘plain white-shirt/white-salwar-kameez/white saree, with a plainwhite neck band’ during the hearings before the Supreme Court of India through Virtual Court System,” the circular issued on Wednesday evening said.The Bar Council of India rules prescribe lawyers to be “sober and dignified” in their dressing while appearing before courts. In the Supreme Court, a lawyer has to be dressed in a coat, white shirt (for men), white or black sari/skirt (for women), gown and white band. The rules have been framed under Section 49(1)(gg) of the Advocates Act, 1961.Chief Justice of India (CJI) S A Bobde had earlier in the day indicated that such an exemption was in the offing when senior advocate Kapil Sibal spotted him and two other judges in a courtroom without gowns and raised a query in this regard. He told Sibal that they have been informed about the possibility of the coronavirus “attaching to their robes” and added he would soon issue instructions allowing an exemption to lawyers from wearing them during the virtual court hearings.“Lawyers wearing coats and ties would be more sober and befitting the highest court of the country. Wearing a plain white shirt does not look dignified,” said Supreme Court Bar Association President Dushyant Dave. The Supreme Court has been hearing urgent cases through video-conferencing in view of the Covid-19 pandemic that has prompted a national lockdown since late March to halt its spread. So far, no dress code was prescribed for lawyers or judges attending the virtual hearing. The lawyers have made it a point to appear in the top court in their gowns.A lawyer appeared before the Rajasthan high court in a vest last month and prompted adjournment of a bail hearing and an order asking lawyers to wear proper uniform even when they appear before courts via video conferencing. The court said that the Advocates Act requires lawyers to appear before courts in a prescribed dress. It added the decorum of courts should be maintained even when they are functioning through the virtual medium. The high court had cautioned lawyers to appear in proper uniform after another lawyer appeared in his vest to argue a case on April 7.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/top-court-exempts-lawyers-from-wearing-coats-gowns/story-NwyU188gCrfQfwZQPE0HUN.html

However, the pandemic has compelled them to return to their respective home states. The disruption caused by Covid-19 has affected an industrially developed state like Gujarat, which has, in turn, affected the nation too,” he said.The committee will submit a comprehensive action plan within a month and an interim report within two weeks.“The committee will assess sectoral and sub-sectoral losses and suggest necessary measures for its revival. The committee will also review the fiscal status and budgetary position of Gujarat and provide suitable suggestions for its improvement. This will include revising and revision of fiscal deficit estimate and the current tax administration in the post Covid-19 scenario,” Kumar said.In the short term, the committee will also examine the decreased availability of workers and recommend ways to make the industry more viable with fewer workers. For the longer term, the committee will devise a strategy to attract foreign companies, which plan to relocate their base from other countries, especially China. It will also provide a comprehensive action plan (immediate, medium-term and long term) for economic and fiscal revival, he said.On Wednesday, the Gujarat Cabinet met to discuss ways to take maximum benefit from the Centre’s relief package. “Discussions were also held at the state cabinet meeting on deciding the strategy for implementation of the package in the state,” read an official statement from the chief minister’s office.Officials said that the cabinet also discussed Lockdown 4.0 and decided that new relaxations would be allowed for two weeks, after which its impact will be reviewed.“We will test how people react to the relaxations and its impact on Covid cases,” a senior government official said, adding that the district officials have been asked to strictly monitor the impact of Lockdown 4.0.“The Lockdown 4.0 may witness the opening of shops and private office on a rotational basis.

According to data accessed by PTI, of the nine trains from Delhi, eight which left for Howrah, Jammu, Thiruvananthapuram, Chennai, Dibrugarh, Mumbai, Ranchi and Ahmedabad were booked beyond their capacity.Only one train, which ran to Patna, the capital of Bihar, ran at 87 per cent capacity, the data showed. Official data also showed that till Wednesday, 2,08,965 passengers had booked tickets for these special trains for journeys over the next seven days. Of the nine trains that left on their journeys on Wednesday, the Howrah to New Delhi train which can carry 1,126 people at a time had a booking for 1,377 passengers which is 122 per cent of the train’s capacity.

People are boarding and deboarding at halt stations and there have been multiple bookings,” said an official.

While on Tuesday evening the ministry had said the number of passengers who travelled on the eight trains was 8,121, on Wednesday they revised the figure to 13,118.On Wednesday, a total of 13 trains were operated.

A day earlier, he had posted a video on Facebook seeking help to go home.Gangadhar Biswal, a migrant worker from Bajapur village of Rajkanika block under Kendrapara district, was found hanging from a tree in Yamuna Vihar area of Haryana this morning by his friends.A few days ago, Biswal had recorded a video narrating how he wanted to come back to his village. Biswal had alleged that the company had defaulted in payment of their dues.In the video, a distraught Biswal had requested the company and the Odisha government to make arrangements for his return to his village, failing which he had threatened to commit suicide. A roommate of Biswal said that he was sick for the past few days and was under severe mental duress.“Gangadhar was under financial pressure as the construction firm we worked for had shut down. The company was earlier giving us money to meet food and other basic needs. When it stopped giving money, we ran out of all our savings. His family had asked him to send money and this may have triggered the mental distress,” his roommate said. When asked by HT whether the video had been sent to any officials, the roommate said that Gangadhar hoped somebody would see it on the social media site itself.Kendrapara district collector Samarth Verma said that he has spoken to Gurugram district collector. The collector said the block development officer has been asked to give Rs 10,000 to Biswal’s family. Further action will be taken once an inquiry is done.On May 9, a 29-year-old migrant worker from Bengal working at an under-construction building on the campus of Indian Institute of Technology in Bhubaneswar too had hanged himself to death. The man from Malda district, working as a mason, was under duress after work stopped in the institute. The deceased mason and other members of his group reportedly had an argument with their contractor a few days ago over demands of going back to their village.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-video-migrant-seeks-help-in-returning-home-found-dead-a-day-later/story-qSDqedu9V2zWsRlJGTU3CI.html

The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) representing India submitted more documents to the court.Thipsay sought to confirm Montgomery’s objections to the ways in which witness statements are made in India under Section 161 of India’s Code of Criminal Procedure, stating that they are made in an atmosphere of “distrust of police machinery”.Fritsch, who has a career in luxury goods and was on the advisory of board of Modi’s jewellery company, lauded his creativity, passion and entrepreneurship that, according to him, made Modi’s company one of the most known at the international level.“All this (extradition case) came as a surprise. No reason to doubt (Modi’s character)”, he told judge Samuel Mark Goozee, who authorised the release of some case papers to the news media.Documents submitted in the Modi case refer to several points of law, objections and rulings made in the Mallya case, as Modi’s defence raised similar objections to extradition: lack of a prima facie case, the alleged impossibility of a fair trial in India, and risk to human rights in the Arthur Road jail in Mumbai.The CPS refers to the Mallya case in its skeleton argument in the Modi case to refute or respond to arguments by Modi’s defence, pointing out that many of the objections put forth had been dismissed in judgments in the Mallya case.The CPS submitted that there is no evidence that “justifies a departure from the approach taken in Mallya” on the issue of lack of prima facie case, admissibility of evidence submitted by India, or on the sovereign assurance by the ministry of home affairs on there being no risk to human rights in the Mumbai jail.The magistrates court and the appeal court of the high court of England and Wales had dismissed similar objections raised by Mallya’s defence team, and recommended his extradition to the home secretary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shades-of-mallya-case-in-nirav-modi-trial-in-uk-court/story-fb5TBB57ZKukiKMz9DJCPL.html
13-05-2020||India||As migrants turn Covid-19 positive, Uttarakhand HC asks state, centre to clarify||Uttarakhand High Court on Wednesday expressed concern over many migrants returning to the state testing Covid-19 positive and asked the state and the Central government to clarify if returnees to the state were also being medically examined since ‘thermal screening is not enough’ and whether antigen tests, or any other rapid tests, could be conducted on people before they returned to the state.Shiv Bhatt, counsel of the petitioner said the court issued these directions while hearing a PIL on the plight of the migrants and other needy people amid lockdown. The PIL alleges that authorities had failed to provide relief materials to the daily wage labourers and other needy persons on their doorsteps during the lockdown, adding that such people are “incapable of approaching the court as in the present crisis they are without any food or money..”. So far seven people, who returned to Uttarakhand from other states during the current operation to send back migrant workers, have been found to be Covid-19 positive after arrival in the state, raising alarm bells. According to government officials, till Wednesday evening, over 2 lakh registrations for return to Uttarakhand had been filed on the state website. Of these, the state government has so far brought back over 56,000 people through trains and buses, while over 6,000 people have returned to the state in their own vehicles. Close to half of 30,971 people, who have registered with Uttarakhand government to return to their respective states so far, have been sent back. For Coronavirus Live Updates“As regarding such persons who wish to come to Uttarakhand, we would like to know from the state authorities whether each person who is being given a permit is also medically examined. Thermal screening is not enough...Let the learned Assistant Solicitor General of India and the learned Advocate General come up with a definite reply as to whether antigen tests, or any other rapid test, can be performed on such persons. We say this because we have already been informed that Covid-19 positive persons have reached far-flung interior areas of the state such as Uttarkashi and Almora”, the court order stated.The HC stated that it has been informed by the state government that there are 49 relief camps which are presently catering to 1,237 persons, mainly migrant workers from the neighbouring states.The HC directed all the district legal services authorities in Uttarakhand to coordinate and cooperate with the district administrations for management of rehabilitation centres through their para-legal volunteers.The court also said that migrant workers wishing to stay in Uttarakhand must be provided with food shelter and medicine.“Those who wish to leave Uttarakhand for their home state, the state must provide free transport and passage to them so that they can reach their destination. What efforts have been made by the state in this direction, has not been disclosed so far”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-migrants-turn-covid-19-positive-uttarakhand-hc-asks-state-centre-to-clarify/story-OZfh7S3r1WlWNNMGTDsBqM.html

The incident happened at Amtali’s East Ballavpur, nearly 16 kilometres from capital Agartala. Mamata Bhowmik, the accused, was later sent into judicial custody for 14 days. According to police, relations between Mamata and her son Prasenjit Bhowmik had been strained for a long time due to certain issues related to family property. Things heated up on Tuesday night when the matter again cropped up and an angry Mamata allegedly attacked her son with a sharp weapon, injuring him badly on his neck and face. Prasenjit was taken to a nearby hospital where his condition is said to be stable. Police said that though the woman has no previous criminal record, she is known in the area as an ‘ill-reputed woman.’ “We filed the case against her under Sections 326 and 307 of Indian Penal Code and arrested her. They had problems related to the family property for a long time. We are investigating the matter,” said Amtali sub divisional police officer Anirban Das.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/60-year-old-woman-in-tripura-held-for-alleged-murder-attempt-at-son-police/story-1ge9GGg3HvhGphSkozcZ3J.html

There’s no pressure to deliver, no deadlines to meet. I am just home with my family and children. After years have I got such a break to simply be with them. Though I know from a business point of view it’s definitely a tough time and a lot of issues await being looked into, but then this is with every one of us, as all industries are on hold since the lockdown was announced.”Tewary has reason to cheer, as two magnum opuses he produced, are back on TV and getting good ratings. “Shows like ‘Mahabharat,’ ‘Karmaphal Daata Shani,’ ‘Ram Siya Ke Luv Kush’ don’t happen easily or in one go. A lot of planning and support from co producers, directors, actors and the entire team come together to bring out such a product. It entails huge work and pressure because a generation has already viewed it earlier. Though, at times, while watching the re-runs I do pick up areas where I find scope of betterment. Also, at times, you feel proud to have produced shows with riveting tales from our history and culture.” When the country went into the lockdown two of his shows ‘RadhaKrishn’ and ‘Devi’ were being extensively shot and now everything is on hold, but he and his company, Swastik Productions, are still providing support to his team. “My crew and workers have been working with us for years and have left their houses in Mumbai for the shoot but with the lockdown in place, they have no place to go, so currently, they are all living at the shoot location in Umargaon. It’s an enclosed location where we are providing amenities to them. We are trying to do our bit, rest we all await government guidelines for our industry and hope to get back to work soon.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/proud-to-have-produced-shows-from-our-history-culture/story-6HL9ZCPgvWXkQqW3Xq6rZI.html

Hence, a case under provisions of the Disaster Management Act, 2005 has been lodged against him for lockdown violation,” said Amitabh Basumatary, additional superintendent of police (head quarter), Goalpara.Alam maintains that he had to rush to Guwahati for better treatment for his wife who is in her seventh month of pregnancy. He said that the case against him was politically motivated.“I came to Guwahati last week as my wife had some medical complication and needed better treatment. Her treatment is still underway in Guwahati. Since it’s a health emergency, there should be relaxation for it. What is the need for permission and other formalities at such times?” questioned Alam.The legislator who is still in Guwahati said the case against him could be politically motivated and the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party could be targeting him as he had highlighted problems faced by people in his constituency due to the lockdown and urged Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal to address them through a press meet.Alam had been placed under quarantine for two weeks in April after a visit to Delhi in March.Assam has recorded 80 Covid-19 positive cases, including 15 new cases on Wednesday.

The surveillance will be launched in all the districts soon after the lockdown is lifted. This will help us to understand the changing trend of the disease, get an early warning before any possible outbreaks and plan for the future,” said Banerjee.The National AIDS Control Organisation has been conducting HIV sentinel surveillance for over more than a decade now to monitor the disease’s trends in the country.The Bengal government has been criticized roundly for low testing rate and high mortality rate amongst Covid-19 patients.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesThe state administration also announced a slew of initiatives to generate employment for migrant workers returning to the state and to boost the rural economy. This comes amid opposition criticism for not doing enough to bring back migrant labourers stranded in other states.“While on one hand, plans are afoot to allow 100 more trains to bring in people stranded in other states, the district administration has been asked to prepare a skill chart of migrant workers which would help in generating some employment opportunities for them. Also, the districts have been asked to generate employment under the 100-days work program.

We had hoped that the states will get some relief along with various sectors. They had already announced Rs 10 lakh earlier. We don’t know when they will release the rest of the money. The centre has given nothing to the states, not a single penny has been allotted for public spending or to fight the pandemic.

The PMO statement said the Prime Minister has thanked all the donors for their generosity in contributing to the PM CARES Fund which will support India’s fight against Covid-19PM Modi had formed the trust on 27 March. Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, Home Minister Amit Shah and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman are the other members of the trust.The government’s decision to create another fund had been sharply criticised by the opposition which had, lately pointed out, why the prime minister was not spending from this fund.Wednesday’s PMMO statement did not say how much money had been mobilised by the government in the last 50-odd days. It only detailed the three expenditure heads.According to the PMO statement, Rs 2,000 crore would be used to buy 50,000 ventilators being made in the country. These ventilators would be provided to government-run Covid-19 hospitals in all states and union territories for better treatment of the critical Covid-19 patients.About Rs 1,000 crore from the PM CARES Fund would also be placed at the disposal of district collectors and municipal commissioners to strengthen their efforts to provide accommodation facilities, arrange for food, medical treatment and transportation arrangements of the migrants.The money, which would be sent via the state disaster relief commissioner, would be released on the basis of the state’s population and number of Covid-19 cases reported from the state.The PMO statement said R^s 100 crore from the PM CARES fund had been allocated to support the Covid-19 vaccine designers and developers. “A vaccine against Covid-19 is the most pressing need and Indian academia, start-ups and industry have come together in cutting-edge vaccine design and development,” it said.

13-05-2020||India||Army considers ‘tour-of-duty’ model to allow youth to serve for 3 years||The Indian Army is examining a proposal that seeks to allow the country’s youth to serve the military for three years under a new “tour of duty” (ToD) model similar to the short-service commission that allows officers to serve for 10 to 14 years, two army officers familiar with the move said on Wednesday.If the proposal is accepted, the army could implement the ToD model - essentially an internship after military training - on trial basis for both officers and other ranks in a limited number of vacancies, said one of the officers cited above.“The proposal is a shift from the concept of permanent service towards an internship or temporary experience of military life,” said the second officer cited above.The proposal, reviewed by Hindustan Times, stressed that the internship model would result in savings for the organisation. It said it will also brighten the prospects of the ToD optees in the corporate world.“The cumulative cost of pre-commission training, pay/allowances, proposed severance packages, leave encashment and other costs is nearly Rs 5.12 crore and Rs 6.83 crore for short-service commissioned (SSC) officers released after 10 and 14 years of service. However, similar costs for those released after three years will be just Rs 80 to Rs 85 lakh,” the proposal stated. It says the ToD model would eventually result in significant reduction in salary and pension budgets, too. The proposal cites a survey that has indicated that corporate houses would prefer employing individuals who have been trained by the military and join them at the age of 26-27 after a three-year ToD rather than college graduates.“Many corporates have indicated that ToD officers would also be preferable to the current SSC workforce joining them at the age of 33-34 after 10 years of service. The ToD concept will become attractive if seen by the youth as a vehicle which boosts their subsequent career in the government or the corporate world,” the proposal said.The ToD model, however, will not be the same as conscription or compulsory military service. Army spokesperson Colonel Aman Anand said, if approved, it will be totally voluntary and there will be no dilution of selection criteria. “This is an ideal opportunity for those individuals who do not want to make defence services their permanent vocation, but still want to experience the thrill and adventure of the military profession and the glamour of donning the uniform,” the proposal said.But what about combat skills, experience and preparedness of the ToD cadre to go to war?“This argument can be negated with the demonstrated performance of our officers and jawans with less than three years service in the Kargil war. If the ToD officers/jawans undergo the same training (for nine months) as the regular officers/other ranks, then their commitment, dedication and performance should not be in any doubt,” the proposal added.Former army vice chief Lieutenant General AS Lamba (retd) said the ToD model was a laudable idea to fill the critical shortfall of young officers on the assumption that performance of officers with three years of service has been extremely good.Lamba, however, said, he saw two challenges. “One, the selection of suitable volunteers from the civil environment for this type of limited engagement who would take much longer to motivate than train. And second, training them for critical front-line combat deployments,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-considers-tour-of-duty-model-to-allow-youth-to-serve-for-3-years/story-OsTsmGdUfthLp1cQ6GW6UM.html
13-05-2020||India||In Karnataka, hotels, gyms and golf courses likely to open after May 17: Govt||In an indication that further lockdown relaxations are in the offing in Karnataka post-May 17, the state’s tourism minister C T Ravi said that hotels, gyms, fitness centres and golf courses will be allowed to open to boost economic activities in the state. The minister said that he had held discussions with Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa about the relaxations.“The CM has said that permission would be given subject to any further Central notifications in this regard. Opening hotels would help revive the tourism industry. Also, all of those sectors have said that they will follow the necessary social distancing norms and other regulations required,” the minister said.He pointed out that tourism was a major contributor to the state’s GDP with nearly 35 lakh people employed in the sector and therefore a ‘survival and revival’ plan was on the cards for it and added the initial focus would be on local tourism. Meanwhile, Karnataka Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa welcomed the Rs 20 lakh crore economic package announced by the Prime Minister and the Finance Minister saying, “The 3 lakh crore aid for MSMEs would be a boon to the economic revival of industries and labourers.”On Wednesday, six more ‘Shramik Special’ trains carrying nearly 9000 migrant workers left from various railway stations in Karnataka, including Bangalore, Mangalore and Hubballi. These trains are going to Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Bihar taking migrant labourers back home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-karnataka-hotels-gyms-and-golf-courses-likely-to-open-after-may-17-govt/story-NWfFZlCPbPVXTiwxSkIjaM.html
13-05-2020||India||Lockdown 4.0: Here’s what different states are considering to open||The state governments are working on the strategy for lockdown 4.0, in which complete shutdowns are expected only in the containment zones-- ranging from a building to a locality—allowing space for the resumption of almost all activities, except large social gatherings and educational institutions, official said.Officials in several states said the guidelines defining containment zones-- a key guidance document for enforcing lockdown 4.0-- would come by Saturday and it was likely to divide a district into red, orange and green zones, unlike the existing methodology of categorizing an entire district as red, orange or green.It appears from the viewpoint expressed by government officials that the states are likely to allow resumption of all industrial activities, offices and standalone markets from May 18 onwards. Public transport including autos and taxis would resume with certain restrictions on number of passengers along with intra-district travel, except for the containment zones. Interstate travel may also be opened up but only for those with travel passes.Permission is also likely to be given for all types of home delivery of goods, officials said. Multiple state government officials privy to discussions on the strategy for lockdown 4 said the educational institutions will continue to remain closed with several states expected to declare summer holidays from May end or June.Similarly, religious and political meetings are unlikely to be allowed for some more time apart from other activities that require or encourage mass gatherings or community participation including shopping in malls and other public places.However, marriages and funerals would be allowed with limited attendees, officials said.Some states may have state specific relaxations, for example, the Karnataka government is in the favour of resuming inter-state travel with mandatory 14-day quarantine for travelers. Even Rajasthan government favours inter-state travel. Kerala, however, wants inter-state travel only on the basis of a pass while Bihar and Jharkhand are opposed to inter-state travel of individuals and have requested the Centre for a guidance document.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19Telangana, which has extended lockdown till May 29, is likely to announce more relaxations in sectors such as information technology and real estate.Kerala wants resumption of metro services, local trains, domestic flights, restaurants and hotels to revive the tourism sector.Karnataka may open restaurants, hotels and gymnasiums. Andhra Pradesh has proposed resumption of all activities except in containment areas. Both Himachal and Uttarakhand would allow hotels and resorts to open with limited capacity.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesGujarat, which has the second highest number of Covid cases, wants to resume all economic activity in all major urban centres except Ahmedabad, which accounts for state’s 70% cases. Rajkot will fully open from Thursday and Surat from Monday, officials said. They added that inter-district travel, resumption of bus services and opening of all offices was on the anvil.Similarly, Tamil Nadu, another industrial state, plans to open all places except containment areas.Maharashtra, which has the maximum number of Covid cases and 1,289 containment zones, has opted for minimalistic approach. The state government officials said they are against the resumption of metro services and inter-district travel. The state is also not in the favour of fully opening all offices although, they favour allowing more industries to function in orange and green zones.In cities such as Mumbai, Pune, Thane and Nashik, lockdown 3.0 conditions are likely to continue, said officials. “Newer hotspots like Aurangabad and Jalgaon have been added to the list of cities such as Mumbai and Pune. In such a scenario, the lifting of the lockdown for at least two more weeks is not possible,” said a senior government officer.Eastern states of Bihar, Jharkhand and Odisha want to continue with stricter lockdown as their Covid cases are increasing due to the return of migrant workers. “We will have no exemptions in the fourth phase as Covid cases are increasing. In fact, we are looking at stricter lockdown,” a Bihar government official said.Jharkhand’s rural development minister Alamgir Alam said the state will allow all standalone shops and will provide work to migrant workers, who have returned home. State governments have formed committees to chalk out specific guidelines for lockdown 4, which would be much more state specific than all the earlier versions of the lockdown. The Andhra Pradesh government has formed as many as six committees to work out lockdown strategies and exit plan for different sectors, said K S Jawahar Reddy, state special chief secretary (medical and health).The Kerala government had constituted a task force which is expected to submit a report by Thursday while Rajasthan government’s expert panel on the exit strategy will submit its report on Friday.Gujarat government has formed a committee of medical experts to suggest measures to control the spread of Covid 19 once the lockdown measures are relaxed. Several states such as Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Rajasthan have also sought people’s suggestions on the features of lockdown 4.0.In Madhya Pradesh, all district collectors and MLAs have been asked to collect suggestions and submit it to the state government by Thursday. Officials said most suggestions are for allowing home delivery of ration and monetary relief to the poor, full resumption of all grain markets and more works under MGNREGA.MP home and health minister Narottam Mishra said, “Lockdown restrictions will continue to be implemented strictly and relaxations during lockdown 4 will be as per prime minister Narendra Modi’s direction.”Maharashtra has sought inputs from district collectors by Thursday, while Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar has already held consultation with all legislators on lockdown 4. In Uttar Pradesh, a senior government official said chief minister Yogi Adityanath has asked people and experts to suggest ways to resume economic activity, measures to attract investment and jobs for migrant labourers.Rajasthan chief minister, too, has sought response from people apart from consulting law-makers on the strategy to exit the lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lockdown-4-0-here-s-what-different-states-are-considering-to-open/story-wAaRB1X4Oj0uvBj3IBu3LO.html
13-05-2020||India||Did not face govt interference in judicial appointments: Ex-CJI Gogoi||Former Chief Justice of India (CJI) and present Rajya Sabha MP Ranjan Gogoi said on Wednesday that the Supreme Court Collegium did not face any government interference during his tenure as the CJI when appointing judges to high courts and the Supreme Court.“Fourteen names were recommended for appointment (as judges) to the Supreme Court during my tenure. They were accepted and appointments made on time. There was never any difficulty. All recommendations with chief justices of high courts also were processed in time. (There was) no executive interference,” he said at a webinar organised by Confederation of Alumni for National Law Universities on the topic ‘Ensuring an independent judiciary under our Constitution’.The former CJI also said that the Collegium system is an excellent method for appointing judges to the high courts and the Supreme Court as the system helps keep in check executive interference when it comes to judicial appointments.“My experience with the collegium is that it is a sure way of keeping the executive out of the appointment process. The executive has got an equal role though the judicial voice is the ultimate voice,” he said.Justice Gogoi also said that protection and immunity afforded to judges should be strengthened so that they can perform their duties fearlessly. The vulnerability attached to the office of a judge dissuades young lawyers from taking up offers to become judges, he said.“The scheme for protection of judges needs to be strengthened. Young lawyers are not keen to become judges. The office of the judge of a high court has been made so vulnerable that a lawyer is happy to continue as a lawyer. Don’t forget the sacrifice a lawyer makes to become a judge,” Gogoi said.He was also critical of a “group” of activists and media who, he alleged, have set benchmarks for judges to be considered independent. Judges are attacked if they do not conform to the standards set by them and such tendencies will sound the death knell for an independent judiciary, Gogoi said.“Activists, web portals, some mainstream media (organizations), this is one group that has laid down ‘identification marks’ for who is an ‘independent judge’. A judge, (according to them), should be anti-authoritarian, eloquent on issues like rich-poor divide, oppression of marginalised and suppression of fundamental rights. If judges don’t conform to these expectations, they are attacked. This is destructive of the independence of the judiciary,” he said.Eyebrows were raised when Justice Gogoi accepted the Rajya Sabha nomination, barely four months into his retirement from the Supreme Court. On the issue of post-retirement jobs, Gogoi, in response to a question, pointed out that there are judges who take to arbitrations after retirement while another group of judges talk about judicial independence and freedom of speech after demitting office.“You talk about post-retirement engagements as compromising judicial independence. What about those other two categories,” he asked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/did-not-face-govt-interference-in-judicial-appointments-ex-cji-gogoi/story-n9We5WOUGTnnlcPQv697cK.html

Imam had moved the court seeking bail after the trial court had rejected his plea for default bail.Default bail is granted to a person when the police does not file a charge sheet or final probe report within a stipulated time during the days of first remand of the accused.Additional Solicitor General Maninder Kaur Acharya appeared for the state while Imam was represented by senior advocate Rebecca John.Imam has challenged the trial court’s April 25 order by which the Delhi Police was granted further time, beyond the statutory 90 days, to complete the investigation in the case filed under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.He has also sought default bail in the matter on the ground that the investigation was not concluded within the statutory period of 90 days. Imam was arrested on January 28 in the case related to violent protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act near the Jamia Millia Islamia University in December last year. The statutory period of 90 days from the arrest was ended on April 27.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-hc-seeks-police-response-on-sharjeel-imam-s-bail-plea/story-OGEcPRMqVYZ6NvmHVPJNsJ.html
13-05-2020||India||Odisha records 101 new Covid-19 cases, its biggest single-day spike||Odisha saw its biggest single-day spike in Covid-19 cases on Wednesday, reporting 101 new infections which pushed the total number of coronavirus cases in the state to 538. Three people have died of the disease in the state so far. State’s health and family welfare department officials said that of the cases reported on Wednesday, 91 were migrant workers who had returned from Surat in Gujarat or West Bengal and were have been staying in quarantine centres.Out of the 101 new cases, almost half -52 -were in Ganjam, taking the district’s total number of cases to 210. Balasore accounted for 33 new cases while Jajpur had 7 new cases. Though Odisha had registered its first 100 Covid cases in 42 days, it recorded the next 400 cases in just 15 days. It took only two days for the state to reach 400 from 300 and just one day to cross 500-mark as more and more migrant workers have returned after the factories and the construction sites they worked at shut down due to the national lockdown. Till Wednesday, an estimated 80, 000 migrant workers had arrived in Odisha with another 4.5 lakh waiting to arrive. As coronavirus cases continue to rise rapidly, Ganjam district continues to remain a source of headache for the Naveen Patnaik government. The first Covid-19 case in Ganjam was detected on May 2 when an 18-year-old male migrant worker of Buguda block arrived in the district in a bus along with 69 other co-passengers. He was kept at a quarantine centre of Kukudakhandi block immediately upon his arrival. Of the 69 passengers, swab samples of 21 were tested, of which 6 tested positive.Between May 2 and May 13, Ganjam added more than 209 cases as more and more people from Surat returned by trains, buses and other modes of transport.“Migrants from Surat, a Covid hotspot have been the biggest source of corona infection in Odisha followed by migrants from Bengal, another Covid hotspot. Of the 538 cases, more than 230 are Surat returnees while another 150 would be those returning from Bengal. Till the migrant workers arrived, we had things under pretty much control,” said Dr Bijoy Mohapatra, director of health services.The director said that with the continuous arrival of migrant workers, there may be a little chance of the curve flattening in Odisha. “Though most of the cases are those in quarantine centres, there is danger of local transmission as some of the persons quarantined may be visiting their families. The more we test, the more positives we will get,” he said. Till Wednesday, Odisha had tested 72,756 samples. Fears of community transmission in Ganjam began after several migrant workers kept in the district’s quarantine centres fled last week while in other cases their near and dear were found to be loitering around the quarantine centres delivering food and other items. Odisha Assembly Speaker Surya Patro too alleged that some of the persons kept in quarantine centres were sneaking out to be with their family members at night.However, Ganjam district Collector Vijay Amruta Kulange said community transmission has not started in the district and steps are being taken to avoid it. “All the positive cases so far have been from the quarantine centres. We are screening people at the railway station from where they are taken to respective quarantine centres. The quarantine centres have been declared as containment zones into which no one can enter or exit. Anyone violating it would be arrested,” he said. “In case a person comes from outside without our notice, the sarpanchs or village heads have been asked to identify them for sending them to mandatory 28-day quarantine.”Apart from the sharp rise in positive cases in Ganjam, health department officials are worried over the possibility of the Surat returnees carrying the L-type strain of coronavirus that was originally found in China’s Wuhan and is known for showing Covid symptoms in patients. Unlike Covid positive cases in other districts, over 90 per cent of the cases detected in Ganjam cases have been symptomatic. Last month, a scientist at Gujarat Biotechnology Research Centre had claimed that the novel coronavirus used for genome sequencing contained the L-type strain that was found at Wuhan in China. However, technical spokesperson of Health department Dr Jayanta Panda said a virological study needs to be done to find out evidence of the L-strain in Odisha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-records-101-new-covid-19-cases-its-biggest-single-day-spike/story-54V3ylD8hv9pn8VoORk37H.html

PM Modi, who had promised a Rs 20 lakh crore (Rs 20 trillion) in his televised address to the nation a day earlier, said the announcements made will go a long way in addressing issues faced by businesses, particularly medium and small enterprises that have been considered the bedrock of the Indian economy.“The steps announced will boost liquidity, empower the entrepreneurs and strengthen their competitive spirit,” PM Modi saidA big part of Wednesday’s announcement focused on small and medium enterprises that will be entitled to get unsecured loans till October 31. This will be available to units with upto Rs 25 crore outstanding and turnover of up to Rs 100 crore.She told reporters the government aims to help 4.5 million businesses by October.Sitharaman will be back tomorrow with more announcements for other sectors.“We have a responsibility toward the poor, the needy, the migrants and the disabled,” Sitharaman said, in the first of several daily press conferences on the 15-point package.“Essentially this is to spur growth and to build a very self-reliant India,” she said. “It addresses ease of doing business, compliance and due diligence and the intention is also to build local brands.”That was the recurring theme in PM Modi’s televised address, his fourth after the coronavirus outbreak in the country. The last three had focused on the 50-day lockdown and the disease.Yesterday, PM Modi appeared to be trying to prepare the country to take precautions, but move on. He told people not to let our lives revolve around the disease but turn the crisis into an opportunity.The three leading industry bodies, CII, Ficci and Assocham, welcomed the announcements.CII director general Chandrajit Banerjee described the first tranche of the package called Atma Nirbhar Bharat Abhiyan “impactful”.“The first phase targets the key sectors of MSME, employee provident fund, Discoms, and taxation among other major areas that are the most impacted,” Banerjee said.Sangita Reddy, president, FICCI, said round one of the package signalled that the government was ready and would lead from the front.Assocham secretary general Deepak Sood said the upward revision of investment limit in the definition of small enterprises is an example of the government responding well to the emergent situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-go-a-long-way-says-pm-modi-on-round-one-of-covid-19-relief-package/story-nhyFw5uzLPNfVdFGvi1LvL.html
13-05-2020||India||Special Covid package has 6 MSME reforms to power PM Modi’s reliant India mantra||The central government on Wednesday announced six reforms to prop up the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) -- considered the backbone of India’s economy—hit by the economic slump triggered by the coronavirus outbreak. The finance minister while announcing the reforms claimed the changes were aimed to make the Indian economy self-reliant. Here are the six reforms or measures announced by the finance minister.1. Collateral free automatic loan for SMEs up to 3 lakh crore which means not a single MSME unit needs to pay any collateral or guarantee for the loans availed under this scheme. They will also not be required to pay any principal component of the loan for the first year. The tenure of the loan will be for 4 years. This will benefit 45 lakh units resume business activities and safeguard jobs, said the FM.2. Rs 20,000 crore subordinated debt for stressed MSMEs facing an equity problem. It will help functioning MSMEs which are either NPA (non performing assets) or are economically stressed. Around Rs 2 lakh MSMEs qualify under this category. The government will provide Rs 4,000 crore partial credit guarantee support to banks and promoters of the MSMEs will be given debt by banks in the form of equity infusion.3. Fund of fund for the infusion of Rs 50,000 crore as equity into MSMEs. This will benefit MSMEs with potential and viability by providing them greater support in capacity expansion and for the purpose of market-listing. This will cover MSMEs that are performing very well and can use the opportunity to expand. 4. The definition of MSME is being changed to encourage MSMEs to grow bigger without losing on the benefits availed by MSMEs. The investment limit that defined an MSME is being revised upwards along with the addition of turnover as criteria to categorise MSMEs. In addition to these, differentiation between manufacturing and service MSMEs is being removed.For micro-enterprises in both the manufacturing and service sectors, the investment limit is being raised from Rs 25 lakh and Rs 10 lakh respectively to Rs 1crore with a maximum turnover of Rs 5 crore. Similarly, for small enterprises in both the sectors, the investment limit is being raised from Rs 5 crore and 2 crore respectively, to Rs 10 crore with a maximum turnover of Rs 50 crore and finally for medium enterprises in manufacturing and service sector, the investment limit was being raised from Rs 10 core and 5 crore respectively to Rs 20 crore with a maximum turnover of Rs 100 crore.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-195. The government procurement tenders up to Rs 200 crore will no longer be open to global tenders/players, allowing MSMEs the chance to compete. The government said it will make necessary amendments to General Financial Rules to enable this provision. Sitharaman said this was a major step towards creating a self-reliant India. 6. Post Covid trade fares will be difficult, therefor e-linkage market is being provided to MSMEs. In addition to this, the government has promised to clear all receivables due to MSMEs in the next 45 days.Also Read: Nirmala Sitharaman Press Conference: Rs 9250 crore relief for provident fund contributor||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/special-covid-package-has-6-msme-reforms-to-power-pm-narendra-modi-s-reliant-india-mantra/story-QJXhVDscZh3o27Rdy3sKEP.html

13-05-2020||India||‘Impactful package’: CII on Nirmala Sitharaman’s economic booster dose||The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) on Wednesday said that Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman has unveiled an “impactful package” to boost the economy with “a prudent and calibrated set of measures”.“Hon’ble Finance Minister has unveiled an impactful package under the first tranche of the Atma Nirbhar Bharat Abhiyan as demanded by the very dire economic circumstances we are in due to Covid-19. The first phase targets the key sectors of MSME, employee provident fund, Discoms, and taxation among other major areas that are the most impacted,” Chandrajit Banerjee, Director General, CII, said in a statement.Banerjee said the six measures announced by Sitharaman for the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) sector are very well targeted and meet the immediate as well as longer term requirements of the sector. “CII had suggested that credit be provided for MSME without collateral requirement and with a guarantee from the Government. The proposal to make the delayed payments from Government and PSEs to MSME was a long-standing request of industry.”He also welcomed the change in the definition of MSME.“The most important announcement with long term implications is the quantum jump in definition of MSME, which had not been changed since the MSME Development Act of 2006 and was long awaited. Along with the decision to not have global tenders for Government procurement up to Rs 200 crore, the redefinition will assist the MSME sector to grow and emerge as a vibrant and dynamic sector, contributing to self-reliance and employment in a big way,” Banerjee said.The CII chief said that the measures on construction, real estate and tax payments add to ease of doing business and reduce the compliance burden for enterprises while infusing confidence among entrepreneurs.“We particularly welcome the action taken to relieve the stress on Discoms which is feeding into the entire economy. The Rs 90,000 crore liquidity infusion will help revive this critical sector,” Banerjee said.He said that it was heartening that many of the measures announced are in line with CII’s recommendations.“The FM has introduced a prudent and calibrated set of measures that promises to stabilise the conditions after the Coronavirus crisis,” Banerjee said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/impactful-package-cii-on-nirmala-sitharaman-s-economic-booster-dose/story-0Bi7sNvFMNrD67Z2K5Ww2J.html
13-05-2020||India||Monsoon set to reach Andaman & Nicobar four days in advance: IMD||Conditions are becoming favourable for the advance of the south-west monsoon over the Andaman and Nicobar Islands around May 16, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD).The normal date for the arrival of the monsoon over the islands is May 20.According to a statement from the IMD, a low pressure area formed over south-east Bay of Bengal and adjoining south Andaman Sea on Wednesday. It is likely to concentrate into a depression over central parts of south Bay of Bengal on May 15, and intensify into a cyclonic storm over south-west and adjoining west-central Bay of Bengal by the evening of May 16.It is then likely to move northwestwards till May 17 and recurve north-northeastwards. These conditions are making it favourable for the monsoons to advance over the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.The IMD will announce whether the monsoons will also make an early appearance over Kerala on May 15.The Weather Company of IBM, a private weather forecaster, has predicted that the monsoons will arrive slightly early over Kerala by May 31. “Our models and data show May 31 as the likely [date of] arrival,” said Himanshu Goyal, India business leader for The Weather Company.“The low pressure area over south Andaman Sea will intensify into a cyclone but we are not yet sure where it will make landfall. It could be over the West Bengal coast or over the northeast,” he added.IMD director general M Mohapatra said: “The normal arrival date for the monsoons over the Andaman and Nicobar Islands is May 20, with a standard deviation of seven days. This time, it is expected to arrive on May 16. We will announce the date of monsoon arrival over Kerala on May 15, based on the latest data.”Roxy Mathew Koll, a climate scientist with the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, said the Andaman region is expecting early rains due to the low pressure system that has formed over south Bay of Bengal.“This low pressure system is expected to develop into a cyclonic storm and pull the south-westerly monsoon winds early into the Andaman seas. An early onset at the Andamans need not mean that the rest of the country will see an early onset. This is because several factors, including low pressure systems in the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal, and the phase of the monsoon intra-seasonal oscillations, govern the northward progression of the monsoon,” he said.There will be gale winds of 65 kmph to 75 kmph, gusting to 85 kmph over south-west and adjoining west central Bay of Bengal from the evening of May 16. Squally winds reaching 45 kmph to 55 kmph will prevail over the Andaman Sea, IMD said on Wednesday.Sea conditions will be rough to very rough over south and adjoining central Bay of Bengal from May 15 to May 16, very rough to high over south-west and adjoining west-central Bay of Bengal from the evening of May 16, it added.Fishermen have been advised not to venture into south and central Bay of Bengal from May 15. Those who are out at sea in these regions have been advised to return to the coast by Thursday, the bulletin said.The IMD has forecast a normal monsoon for this year. A few global climate models are indicating the possible development of weak La Nina conditions over the Pacific Ocean during the second half of the monsoon season.La Niña is characterised by unusually cold ocean temperatures in the equatorial Pacific and good monsoon rains. Mohapatra said a more refined monsoon forecast with zone-wise distribution will be issued by the IMD in May-end or early June.Under the influence of a western disturbance, thundershowers are likely over the Western Himalayan region and over the plains of northwest India during the next two to three days. “Isolated thunderstorm accompanied with hail, gusty winds and lightning is also likely over these regions during the same period,” the IMD bulletin said. The Delhi-NCR region too is likely to witness thundershowers.Due to a trough or area of low pressure, thundershowers with lightning and gusty winds of 30 kmph to 40 kmph are very likely over south peninsular India during the next four to five days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-set-to-reach-andaman-nicobar-four-days-in-advance-imd/story-TLcDDzBr8APsAswPPlPB1H.html
13-05-2020||India||Maoists let police constable go after his wife pleads at ‘people’s court’||The Maoists allowed a police constable to walk free after his wife and daughter pleaded with them at a ‘Janadalat (people’s court)’ in Bijapur.Constable Santosh Kattam, abducted on May 4 from the Gorna village, was allowed to go home after he agreed to leave his police job and practise farming.The constable was posted in Bhadrachalam. Kattam’s wife Sunita, along with his daughter and a journalist, went into the jungle to plead for the release of her husband. The Maoists’ self-styled Kangaroo court, ‘Janadalat’, held in the jungles of Bijapur district found Santosh ‘not guilty’.“The Maoists were speaking in a different language in janadalat, we could not understand a word but they were asking questions to the villagers and at last they released my husband,” said Sunita, talking to mediapersons.The woman said her husband left the house on May 4 to get ration. He was on a bike and never returned.Two days later, the Maoists sent a message about the ‘janadalat’, about 40 km from Bijapur district headquarters, in which the fate of her husband was to be decided.“Santosh was released unharmed as people in the ‘Janadalat’ supported him and told Maoists not to kill him. The Maoists released Santosh after he agreed to leave his police job and practise farming at his ancestral village,” said Ganesh Mishra, a local journalist who went with Sunita.Meanwhile, the police are recording the constable’s statement and also conducting his medical examination.“We had information that the constable was missing but if we had launched any operation it could have been fatal. His family was also making efforts to trace him and bring him back.

Speaking after a meeting of the state cabinet, ports and rural development minister Michael Lobo said he had sought relaxations to allow tea stalls and restaurants to open with ample space between tables so that these businesses can be revived. “I have requested that small businessmen, who are having trouble today, like a restaurant, like a small gaddo (street food vendor) and tea stalls should be allowed to open with proper social distancing and the use of hand sanitisers,” Lobo said. Giving an example, he said if an outlet has 10 tables for customers, they could be reduced to six. “In such a way, the small business owners can restart their businesses,” he added.“I have asked the chief minister to convey to the Centre that such relaxations should be given in green zones,” Lobo said. Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant had earlier indicated his willingness to welcome tourists to the state, but qualified his statement by saying that standard operating procedures for travellers will be drafted only after the Centre gives the green light for such a move. The state has already reopened several sectors, including manufacturing industries, public transport, shops, private establishments and markets, as part of relaxations made during the third phase of the lockdown. However, restaurants, malls, casinos, pubs and bars continue to be closed.Goa has recorded only seven coronavirus infections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lockdown-4-0-goa-wants-tea-stalls-restaurants-to-reopen-in-order-to-boost-economy/story-jtJb3HrQrzCvre4FLLKADJ.html

Local residents alleged the CRFF opened fire at Mehrajudin without any reason. Ghulam Nabi, the father of Mehrajudin, said: “I received a call from my neighbour that my son had been injured. He had left his house with his uncle in the morning and was shot dead while on way to work.”Nabi, who retired as a government employee, said he had no information on why his innocent son was killed without any reason. “In the morning, he left his house for work and hours later, his body arrived at our house. This is inhuman.”People assembled at Mehrajudin’s house and shouted slogans against his killing. “If this young man had jumped the check point, as the CRPF is saying, why didn’t they fire at the tyres of his vehicle? Was it necessary to kill him?” said his neighbour Bashir Ahmad.Local residents too said Mehrajudin’s uncle was a witness to the incident as he was with him in the car when CRPF personnel opened fire. The uncle was taken by police.CRPF spokesman Pankaj Singh said a vehicle broke through a check point of Jammu and Kashmir Police at 10.20am and sped away. The vehicle approached another check point manned by the CRPF and jumped that one too, he said. “At that time, a convoy of the army was passing through an adjacent road and, fearing sabotage, the CRPF jawan manning the check point fired warning shots. The car was driving in the wrong direction of the road and that was even more alarming,” Singh said.“When the car didn’t stop despite the warning shots, the jawan fired at the car and the driver was hit on his left shoulder. He was shifted to SHMS Hospital in Srinagar, where he was declared brought dead by doctors.”Former chief minister Omar Abdullah described the man’s killing as unfortunate and called for an investigation.“Very unfortunate. The circumstances surrounding this shooting need to be impartially investigated & findings made known. My condolences to the family of the deceased,” he tweeted.Jammu and Kashmir Apni Party leader and former minster Ghulam Hassan Mir condemned the killing and demanded a timebound probe. He said the use of excessive force in implementing the nationwide Covid-19 lockdown is unjustified. “There are no words to express our grief over this avoidable loss of precious life. This unjustified use of force to enforce the Covid-19 lockdown only adds to the alienation and resentment among the people,” he said.Mehrajudin is second civilian killed by the CRPF in Kashmir in the recent past. Earlier, a 14-year-old boy was killed at Langate after militants attacked a CRPF patrol at Kralgund in north Kashmir. Three CRPF troopers were killed in the attack, while the militants escaped.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/civilian-killed-in-budgam-by-crpf-mainstream-leaders-demand-probe/story-X9yOfG10nb9ou70C8eqGBN.html

It asserted that Rs 1 crore was paid in advance to the railway ministry.The government’s information directorate has put details of payment made by the state government to Indian Railways and its communication with the Centre on running special trains to bring back its people stranded on other states.Meharban Singh Bisht, director general (DG) information, said, “The decision to put all the aforementioned information in public domain in a transparent manner was taken after a section of media had claimed on Tuesday that the state government didn’t pay for the tickets of about 1,200 migrants who returned in a special train from Surat.”The officer added that the reports were an effort to tarnish the government’s image. “Such reports were deliberately circulated by the section to malign the government which is tirelessly putting in all efforts to bring all the migrants back to home amid lockdown,” said Bisht.The DG said that in future also the information department will put all such information in the public domain if any misinformation is circulated against the government. “What happened was part of a sinister campaign by a section of the media which is against the state government which we will counter effectively in the same manner,” he added.Earlier today, cabinet minister and government spokesperson Madan Kaushik said the state government had paid in advance to the railways so that “the migrants need not pay for the tickets for special trains.”Kaushik said, “Our government is fully committed to bring all our migrants stranded in other states in buses or special trains. Till Tuesday, we have received about 2.02 lakh registrations to return to the state. So far we have succeeded in bringing about 63,000 migrants back home while following all the necessary precautions amid the pandemic.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gave-rs-1-cr-to-railways-uttarakhand-on-migrants-made-to-pay-train-fare/story-LNz32CXnl7SldyDxKolE6H.html
13-05-2020||India||In a first, Telangana govt plans to tell farmers what to grow basis land and climatic conditions||The Telangana government is considering a new recipe to boost farm incomes: dictating farmers, depending on their land and climatic conditions, what to grow, a first in the country. In a nod to Chinese-style regulations, the move, backed by scientific evidence and experts’ advice, could raise productivity and incomes from farming, analysts said. But it will also see the state on take a bigger role in the farm sector, rather than leaving it to the markets. Farmers not following the sowing recommendation will not be offered federally determined minimum support prices, as a form of disincentive. They will also not qualify for various input subsidy under the state’s flagship Rythu Bandhu scheme. Input subsidies denote cheap fertilisers and agricultural chemicals, funded by the government. Chief minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao on Sunday took a meeting with agricultural scientists and agronomists –experts in the science of crop yields– for a final set of recommendations, a statement from his office said.The state is poised to implement a broad plan that will suggest which crops should be grown, depending on where farmers are located. According to the plan created by agriculture scientists in the state, paddy has been allotted 8-9 million acres, while cotton is on 5 million acres. Among pulses, tur (a lentil) is sought to be grown 1 million acre and corn on 0.7 million acre. On rest of the arable land, vegetables ought to be grown on 0.35 million acres. The state will introduce palm oil cultivation interspersed across the state because palm plantation can withstand drought. “If this policy is followed, then the agriculture produce from the state would get good price. The government should decide on which crop the farmer should cultivate and it is important that the entire cultivation is done based on this policy,” a statement from the state said.The policy is basically an attempt to break the practise of mono-cropping and introduce crop diversification, said KS Mani of the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University. Crop diversification and more science-based agricultural raises per-acre incomes, he said.Since rice and wheat fetch higher MSPs, farmers tend to grow much of these and little of others, upending the output balance. This has led to surplus of cereals in the country at the cost of other food articles. Small farmers who don’t have economies of scale because smaller farms have higher cultivation costs don’t profit from such large-scale wheat-rice systems. According to the government’s Doubling of Farmers’ Income Report, 2017, the average income of an agricultural household during July 2012 to June 2013 was as low as Rs 6,426 against an average monthly consumption expenditure of Rs 6,223. In 2019, Haryana started a scheme to disincentivise rice growing in the state to save water in the severely water depleted state, which saw moderate success. The unique experiment in Haryana could well break a long-standing chokehold on the state’s seriously depleted water table: rampant paddy.Fifteen thousand farmers in the state, who have traditionally grown only rice, will not be growing the water-intensive crop this summer, the first time in 30 years. They have signed up for a state government drive that rewards them with cash and freebies for ditching paddy for maize.According to Haryana’s farm department, every hectare (2.4 acre) brought under maize cultivation from rice would save the state 14,000 litres of water needed for irrigation.“The total area under maize cultivation in districts chosen for the drive now stands at 50,000 hectares,” said Suresh Gehlawat, additional director in the state agriculture department. The move is expected to save 700 million litres of water for the entire season.In the grain-bowl states of Punjab and Haryana, a practice of paddy-wheat cycle (paddy during summers, wheat during winters) has driven aquifers to an alarmingly low levels.The campaign worked because of a string of freebies and a state-backed guarantee that all the maize harvested by farmers, who signed up for the programme, would be bought by the state at federally fixed minimum support prices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-a-first-telangana-govt-plans-to-tell-farmers-what-to-grow-basis-land-and-climatic-conditions/story-Bu8GyVFK0lLduReuWFIqPJ.html

The pattern is seen in cases that are heard by special POCSO courts, it added.“Traditionally, prosecution has depended on the sole evidence of rape victims in courts. Oral evidence of the victim, though sufficient to punish the rapist, has its limitations. Due to delays, a victim’s memory often fades, because of which defence lawyers can manage to confuse them during cross-examination and make their statements appear to be contradictory and false,” said senior Supreme Court advocate Vivek Sood, who worked with the consultancy group on this study.A study by public affairs consultancy Gordon Thomas Honeywell-GA said that four different courts in Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu have convicted perpetrators found guilty of raping minors, primarily based on forensic DNA evidence.“DNA forensics have proved to be one of the most powerful tools worldwide to help nab criminals in sexual crimes. DNA evidence gathered with rape kits can identify an unknown assailant or confirm the presence of a known suspect. Not only can it connect the suspect to crime scenes and identify serial offenders, it can also exonerate those who are wrongfully accused,” said Tim Schellberg, Founder and President, Gordon Thomas Honeywell-GA.The process is becoming successful because of proper and timely collection of biological evidence by the police and medical examiners from the crime scene and the victim’s body following an incident. The evidence is then matched with DNA samples gathered from suspects leading to positive identification.Based on the scientific evidence, the courts are able to disregarded conflicting statements made by hostile witnesses to arrive at their verdict.“In 2018, every fourth rape victim across the country was a minor and in almost 95 per cent of rape cases, the offenders were known to the victims. These statistics not only show the vulnerability of children to sexual predators but also explain why rape survivors are pressured by their family to turn hostile,” said Suman Nalwa, DCP, Delhi Police, quoting figures from the latest National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) report.The number of DNA profiles developed from crime scene evidence has doubled over a year from 10,000 cases tested in 2017 to nearly 20,000 in 2019, as per Gordon Thomas Honeywell-GA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-forensic-dna-method-helps-courts-in-taking-quick-decisions-in-rape-cases/story-KmVcr5l8woQts8yPPbbo2M.html

Andaman Islands are also likely to experience heavy rainfall at a few places on these two days, it said. Meteorological department tracks monsoon’s course every year as it moves from the Andaman Sea towards Kerala by the end of May. Last year the southwest monsoon current reached south Andaman Sea and Nicobar Islands on May 18, two days ahead of its normal schedule but its further advance was sluggish and it reached Kerala only on June 8—seven days behind schedule. Last year the monsoon covered the entire country by July 19—at least 4 days behind the normal course. However, it displayed even more irregular behavior during its withdrawal, which only started from northwest India on October 9—more than a month after September 1-- when it generally starts to recede.The withdrawal of monsoon last year was noteworthy for one more reason since it happened very quickly, in a space of just a week to finish by October 16. The normal date for the completion of withdrawal of monsoon is October 15.The meteorological department has been issuing monsoon forecasts since 2005 and it claims to have got it right every time except in 2015. Last year it predicted that the monsoon will reach Kerala on May 6 with an error margin of 4 days on either side of the predicted date. According to the latest prediction, the southwest monsoon will reach the Andaman and Nicobar Islands four days before the regular schedule.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/southwest-monsoon-may-reach-andaman-and-nicobar-islands-ahead-of-schedule-this-year/story-XhKt3hMnkVqKcDVcMbNhIO.html

If all of us decide to use only local products, then India can be self- sufficient in five years,” Shah tweeted. कल माननीय प्रधानमंत्री श्री @narendramodi जी ने देश को आत्मनिर्भर बनाने और लोकल प्रोडक्ट्स (भारत में बने उत्पाद) उपयोग करने की एक अपील की जो निश्चित रूप से आने वाले समय में भारत को विश्व का नेतृत्व करने का मार्ग प्रशस्त करेगी। pic.twitter.com/KlYD9Z7UVtThe minister said that the PM’s appeal to make the country self-reliant and use local (indigenous) products will surely help chart the path for India to lead the world.In his fourth address to the nation on Tuesday since March 24, PM Modi said that local manufacturing has helped India during this crisis. “The crisis has taught us that local is going to help us. So, we should become vocal for local - not only buy local, but advertise it too,” said the PM.The local must become a mantra of our life, emphasised the PM.The Central Police Canteens (CPCs) of paramilitary forces, or Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs), cater to close to 50 lakh family members of about 10 lakh personnel serving in CRPF (Central Reserve Police Force), BSF (Border Security Force), ITBP (Indo-Tibet Border Police), CISF (Central Industrial Security Force), SSB (Sashastra Seema Bal), NSG (National Security Guards) and Assam Rifles.There are over 119 master canteens and 1,625 subsidiary canteens at various locations where these forces are deployed, be it along borders or the interiors of Naxal violence-hit or insurgency affected states. These canteens were established in 2006 after a demand from personnel that armed forces already have such canteens for their families.Shah said that combined sales of all the CAPF canteens is worth Rs 2,800 crore annually. The CPCs are already selling locally made products to a large extent after a ministry of home affairs (MHA) order last year.The MHA had asked the CAPFs, in October 2019, to shun foreign brands and introduce ‘swadeshi’ goods, including food items, accoutrements for khaki, combat and regular duty uniform, bed sheets, towels, household goods, clothing and stationary and other items in their canteens and offices.Large number of items by these canteens is now being procured from Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC).However, no deadline was given at that time.Amit Shah’s announcement today that all CPCs will have only local products means they won’t be able to sell anything foreign made from June 1.S S Deswal, Director General of ITBP, who is also holding additional charge as chief of BSF, told HT: “Most of the items we use in our daily life are made in India and are procured from Indian companies, including uniforms, food, clothes and even weapons. In fact, during the Covid-19 pandemic, all the masks, sanitisers and equipment used for sanitization were manufactured by Indian companies.

She also demanded full payment of all pending dues to farmers.The Congress general secretary also sought relief for small and medium industries in the state.Weavers and carpet makers were also mentioned in Priyanka Gandhi’s letter as she demanded financial relief and loan waiver for them.Congress leader Jitin Prasada said on Wednesday that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in Uttar Pradesh has utterly failed in helping the people. “All power has been concentrated in the hands of the government, there is no voice through which you can reach the officials and people are helpless as to where to go,” the former Union minister had said.Prasad said that he has been telling Congress workers that the priority is that the lockdown has been on for two months now and as it is being eased it is important to strongly raise law and order issues and concerns of farmers like procurement of wheat.Congress president Sonia Gandhi has taken a “historic” decision on behalf of the party to pay for the rail ticket of migrant labourers and now it is the responsibility of all Congress workers to ensure that no one in need is left out, he said.Priyanka Gandhi had earlier alleged laxity in the procurement of wheat in Uttar Pradesh, saying that the farmers are forced to wait for three days to get their produce sold in the mandis. “In UP the procurement of wheat is not done in pace as the farmers have to queue up for 3 days to sell their produce. There is no one to hear their grievances. The government had been alerted much before, but it did not act,” she had tweeted on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/priyanka-gandhi-writes-to-yogi-adityanath-gives-11-suggestions-to-deal-with-covid-19-crisis-in-up/story-Q95XKdSMMW4nSbP1zd5DSL.html

Besides being the talk of the town, he has also been given a certificate of appreciation by the Akhil Bharatiya Bishnoi Mahasabha. It was just another day for Mukesh, who along with team member Pukhraj, started his night vigil, without knowing he will become a hero for many.The nationwide lockdown to stop the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has come with additional responsibility for Mukesh, who is part of the 15-member team to protect the chinkara, poached allegedly for its meat.“Before lockdown, our team used to be on night vigil twice a week but with lockdown, we are working seven days a week. Protecting flora and fauna is our religion,” the Class 11 student said.After dropping the rest of the team member to respective locations, Mukesh and Pukhraj took a halt to drink water at the government school at Bhalu Anupgarah at 8.30pm, before heading to their scheduled place. “We heard a gunshot and immediately rushed towards it in our jeep. At a distant, we saw that four people were armed and carrying a chinkara and after spotting us they started running,” he said.“Our jeep got stuck in the sand, so I jumped out to chase them. One of them, whom I know, pointed a gun at me but it wasn’t loaded… I charged at him and struggle started,” he added.As the scuffle was on, the two men carrying the chinkara started running and others returned to attack.“He pushed me and I lost my balance and tumble down the sand dune. However, during the tussle with the poacher, I got hold of their gun. As they ran in away in the dark, we sent a message to our members through the group created on WhatsApp,” he said.In the next 10-12 minutes, around 100 people including villagers reached the spot. They followed the blood trail of the shot chinkara and reached village Chamu, around 7km away from the spot. Officials of the forest department were also informed, who reached and raided the house but the poachers managed to flee. Mukesh said this was the second incident that poachers have opened fire. The last time it was at his friend. When asked whether he was scared of the armed men, he said, “No, saving chinkaras is my religion and the society is with me.”The youngest amongst his siblings, Mukesh said his family knows what he is doing.“My mother was more petrified but I made her understand and father after receiving calls from many, now is settled with the incident.”Mukesh, a student of humanities who studies when he gets time off his vigil from 8pm to 3am, wants to serve the animals in future. Mahendra Choudhary, the forest ranger, said a first information report (FIR) has been lodged and out of the four accused, two have been identified. They raided the suspect’s house but could not nab them. A traditional muzzleloading gun (topidar) has been recovered and efforts to nab the accused are being made, officials said. Poachers have been hunting the chinkara despite their status of an endangered animal under Schedule-I of the Wildlife Protecting Act, 1972. The Bishnoi sect, which protects animal and trees as part of their religious beliefs, guards chinkaras in the Marwar region of Rajasthan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/17-year-old-rajasthan-boy-fought-with-armed-chinkara-poachers-chased-them/story-UzlqJiu2HLs40yUtTazUeN.html

According to the study, 84 per cent of the households received food items through the public distribution system and 37 per cent received take home ration. About 24 per cent of the households borrowed foodgrain in villages and 12 per cent people received free food.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe findings of the study were released in a webinar on Wednesday.The study found that households have depended on kharif stock more than rabi, but that stock is now depleting fast.“Households are coping with the shock by eating less food and fewer times and with large dependence on PDS Need for increased food support through PDS and promotion for food crop cultivation in kharif,” the study said.It pointed out that the preparedness for kharif 2020 is low and there is a need for public support in terms of seed provision and credit.It further said that a large chunk of migrants are yet to return to rural India.“Lockdown and rumours have indeed adversely affected income - dairy and poultry. The coping mechanisms mostly clustered around change in food habits and reduction in expenditures,” the study said.The states where the survey was conducted were Assam, Bihar, Chattisgarh, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal. The survey was carried out by civil society organisations PRADAN, Action for Social Advancement, BAIF, Transform Rural India Foundation, Grameen Sahara, SAATHI-UP and the Aga Khan Rural Support Programme with research support of Vikas Anvesh Foundation and Sambodhi.Speaking at the webinar, Madhu Khetan, the programme director at PRADAN, said the survey was conducted in villages which were comparatively more accessible and the situation in remote villages might be worse. According to Girish Sohani, the president of BAIF, the survey also raises certain health aspects and there will be more such surveys to better assess the ground situation.The nationwide lockdown imposed from March 25 aims at preventing the spread of the novel coronavirus that has claimed 2,415 lives and infected 74,281 people in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-lockdown-50-percent-of-surveyed-households-in-rural-india-eating-less/story-DZZOQFlWPq7k1AZ2Gu7f0M.html

A day later, on Tuesday, the PM addressed the nation, exhorting citizens to be “atmanirbhar”, or self- reliant, and announced an economic stimulus of Rs 20 lakh crore. Today, on Wednesday, he is meeting secretaries of the empowered groups to discuss Covid-19 and the lockdown situation. The meeting is underway at the PM’s Lok Kalyan residence.The PM, in his address to the nation, pointed out that experts have warned that coronavirus will remain a part of our lives for a long time, but stressed the need to move forward. “We cannot allow this to happen that our lives will be confined only around the corona. We would wear masks, follow two yards distance and pursue our goals,” he stressed.PM Modi said the world has never seen or heard such a crisis and underlined that “we have to save ourselves and move ahead”.Undaunted by the challenge, the PM highlighted how the present crisis is an opportunity. “When the Corona crisis started, there was not a single PPE kit made in India. The N-95 masks were produced in small quantity in India. Today we are in a situation to produce 2 lakh PPE and 2 lakh N-95 masks daily. We were able to do this because India turned this crisis into an opportunity,” said the PM.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-meeets-empowered-group-on-covid-19-lockdown/story-3hCLWzHCM3zBZlY9BtQxzN.html

13-05-2020||India||In Hizbul’s Kashmir terror team, ‘military adviser’ is most brutal: Cop||Hizbul Mujahideen boss Syed Salahuddin’s move to name three terrorists from across the Line of Control to lead the terror group in Kashmir has prompted security agencies to reset the search for the outfit’s new leadership in the valley.Riyaz Naikoo, Salahuddin’s prime point person in Kashmir till last week, was killed in a joint operation of Kashmir police and Rashtriya Rifles that traced the 32-year-old to a secret bunker in a Pulwama village, not far from the house where he lived before picking up the gun.Salahuddin picked Ghazi Haider aka Saifullah Mir as the Hizbul’s so-called chief commander in Kashmir.Zafarul Islam, believed to be the nom de guerre for 55-year-old Ashraf Maulvi would be Ghazi Haider’s deputy and Abu Tariq Bhai, his so-called chief military adviser.Of the three, a top official in Jammu and Kashmir said, Abu Tariq Bhai has been the most brutal in the choice of his killings and its execution.“We believe Abu Tariq Bhai is a Hizbul terrorist we have known as Zubair Wani from Anantnag,” a senior police officer said.All three, like most of the Hizbul leadership, have been active in south Kashmir districts of Anantnag, Pulwama and Shopian.Police officers in Kashmir said they had started a fresh search for these terrorists but stressed that they expected the fresh recruitments to slow down for some time due to Naikoo’s elimination. “It was a huge setback for the Hizbul,” one senior officer said.In a widely-circulated video that emerged after Naikoo’s death, Salahuddin described Naikoo’s death as a “shock for all of us” but noted that these sacrifices had been going on in Kashmir for long. Since January this year, he said 80 fighters, or terrorists, had given up their lives for the cause of Kashmir.The burly, bearded Salahuddin, once an Islamic preacher who wanted to join politics, had crossed over into Pakistan-occupied Kashmir more than three decades ago after the 1987 rigged elections. It is here that he founded the Hizbul Mujahideen, the terror group funded by Pakistan’s deep state. Unlike other terror groups such as the Lashkar-e-Taiba, the Hizbul has mostly been powered by local recruits. Fueling discontentment has been a key part of the strategy.Salahuddin’s family insulated from terrorBut he has insulated his family from terror activities.“How he has been able to do this is really remarkable... Unless his family knows him better,” a senior police officer said.Three of his five sons hold jobs in the state government or its bodies. The fourth son is a doctor who practises in Srinagar and the youngest has an engineering degree and runs a skill development institute in Kashmir.Of the other three, one is a medical assistant at the Sher-i-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences, the second is a computer operator in the Budgam education office and the third, Syed Yousuf, worked at the agriculture department.Syed Yousuf did get into trouble after the National Investigation Agency revived a 2011 case against him in 2017 for receiving tainted money from his father through hawala channels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-hizbul-s-kashmir-terror-team-military-adviser-is-most-brutal-cop/story-9Usedih8IvHyvs3JUzu1sM.html

13-05-2020||India||‘Deforestation, exploitation of wildlife leads to pandemics like Covid-19’: Epidemiologist||New research has confirmed that Sars-Cov-2 is very closely genetically related to coronaviruses from bat populations, and specifically rhinolophus bats, and pangolins may have been intermediate hosts in transmission to humans. Such pandemics will become more likely and spill-over risks of dangerous viruses are increasing even as Covid-19 outbreak is bringing the world to a grinding halt.Dr Pranav Pandit, a veterinary epidemiologist at One Health Institute, University of California Davis, said there is scientific evidence linking deforestation, rapid urbanisation, climate change with pandemics like Covid-19, which offer clues to how pandemics can be prevented.Excerpts from an email interview:Q. Is there scientific evidence about the natural origin of Sars-Cov-2?A. Epidemiologically speaking, the latest evidence including a paper in Nature published on May 7 points towards a hypothesis that bats could harbour the phylogenetic ancestor virus of Sars-Cov-2. The most likely candidate is “bat coronavirus RaTG13” and Malayan Pangolins could be intermediate hosts. The earlier relationship of Sars-Cov-2 with “bat coronavirus RaTG13” was raised by the analysis conducted by other papers also.Q. An estimated 60% of emerging human pathogens are zoonotic. Why has the threat of zoonotic diseases increased?A. There is surely an increase in emerging viruses from animals. Just over the last five years, the world has seen great outbreaks of emerging zoonotic viruses including the Zika virus, Ebola virus, and now Sars-Cov-2. Overall, this is attributed to anthropogenic pressures that we exert on environmental systems, including cOur recent study shows that exploitation wildlife populations and degradation of habitats are one of the important ecological divers behind the emergence of viruses from wildlife to humans. https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2019.2736These rapid anthropogenic changes are animal-human interfaces where humans frequently get in contact with wild animals allowing viruses to evolve and jump into humans leading to the emergence of a new virus. Some of our earlier work has similar interpretations for a group of emerging viruses called flaviviruses (zika virus, yellow fever virus, dengue virus). https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-07896-2Q. Did scientists see a pandemic of this scale coming?A. Because the world is more interconnected than ever through travel and trade, it is likely that we will see pandemics at an increasing rate. We hope we can shift thinking from pandemic response to pandemic prevention. Disease emergence that occurs anywhere can affect us all and we need to all understand the impact we are having when we interact with wildlife, realise that disease emergence is an environmental issue, and find more sustainable ways to co-exist.Q. What is the link between deforestation and zoonoses?A. We alter the landscape through deforestation, conversion of land for growing crops or raising livestock, or building up communities, and this, in turn, alters the natural distribution of wildlife and increases the frequency and intensity of contact between humans and wildlife – creating the perfect conditions for virus spillover. Wildlife also shift their distributions to accommodate anthropogenic activities and modification of the natural landscape. This has hastened disease emergence from wildlife, which puts us at risk of pandemics because we are all globally connected through travel and trade.Q. Could certain indigenous hunting communities have antibodies to these viruses?A. Certainly, antibodies against some zoonotic viruses have been detected in certain tribal communities without any known detected outbreak of disease. This only means that those communities have been only exposed to those or similar viruses since many times serological response and tests are not very specific to a single virus. An example of a study in India is the following https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0007733. Studies like these show human-animal interactions lead to exposure of animal viruses to humans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/deforestation-exploitation-of-wildlife-leads-to-pandemics-like-covid-19-epidemiologist/story-QNnOsXd2sqR3QOQ6UqxVFI.html
13-05-2020||India||India’s job losses at historic peak, as economy awaits resuscitation||India’s unemployment rate has quickened to historic highs despite a fleeting sign of recovery, costing well over 114 million jobs, mostly of small traders and daily wagers, data from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) shows.The country’s unemployment rate touched 27.1 per cent in the week ended May 3 - the highest ever - indicating a bloodbath in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic and the lockdown.Not surprisingly, India’s factory output, a key measure of economic activity, shrunk by 16.7 per cent, data from the Central Statistics Office showed on May 12, signalling that a widespread shutdown had bit the economy hard.The lockdown imposed on March 24 has shuttered shops, factories and services, such as tourism, eateries and public transport, devastating jobs. Millions of displaced migrant labourers continue to flee major cities for their home states, as they fight a survival battle.Mounting unemployment will pile more pressure to ease pandemic restrictions, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi saying on May 12 that new lockdown rules would be announced on May 18.“It (unemployment rate) seems to have risen because of a surge in the labour participation rate from 35.4% in the week of April 21 to 36.2% in the week ended May 3,” said the CMIE’s Mahesh Vyas. In any job survey, people with jobs are categorised as employed. People without jobs but looking for work are considered unemployed. However, the labour force participation rate is simply equal to people who are employed plus people who are not employed.In a rough-and-ready sense, the unemployment rate is then simply the number of unemployed divided by the total labour force times 100.According to Vyas, the spike in the unemployment rate indicates that “this surge in job seekers was highly disappointed. They could not find jobs. Their addition to the labour force merely raised the unemployment rate”.Manufacturing output shrank 20.6 per cent, electricity production dropped 6.8 per cent and mining remained flat, according to the official data released on May 12. The figures are likely to be revised as the lockdown has impacted data flow, the statistics ministry said. In the week ended April 26, the country’s unemployment rate was 21.1 per cent, substantially lower than the 26.2 per cent rate recorded in the preceding week, according to the CMIE’s data. The latest weekly unemployment rate, which showed an improvement, is more because of a technical reason: a fall in the labour participation rate.Previously, the country’s unemployment rate stood at 6.1 per cent for July 2017-June 2018, according to the last periodic labour force survey (PLFS), the only official survey, released in June 2019 showed. This rate then was at a 45-year high.“It is not surprising that small traders and wage labourers account for most of these losses. They have been the most severely hit during the lockdown,” a CMIE report said. Employment in fact has been rolling steeply downhill. “I have no work, no savings and no money,” a Big Bazaar floor staffer requesting anonymity said, adding he had not got his salary for last month. The Consumer Pyramids Household Survey, a proprietary tool of CMIE, estimates that employment fell by a massive 114 million in April, 2020. In March 2020, employment had already dropped to 396 million. This was the lowest employment since we started measuring it over four years ago. Even this low level dropped dramatically by 29 per cent to 282 million in April this year.When the economy hobbles, analysts say vulnerable jobs without safety nets take the first hit. Unemployment then spreads to more secure sectors. “The picture for April would be worse with virtual nil growth in most sectors which will mean a very large dip in growth rate in manufacturing. Only some segments like food and pharma could show positive growth,” Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at Care Ratings said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/historic-high-122-million-people-lost-jobs-in-india-in-april-due-to-covid-19/story-ys47k90I4km6qYxA9wiWpI.html

13-05-2020||India||Nitish Kumar directs ramping Covid-19 testing as migrants inflow increases in Bihar||Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar on Tuesday evening directed the top brass of the state administration to increase testing in view of the growing number of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19 ) cases and a steady inflow of migrants. The number of Covid-19 cases has reached 879, from just 66 on April 14, in the state. Kumar said during a review meeting that random testing in the state would not be enough now and the testing capacity must be increased to 10,000 per day amid the arrival of migrant workers, which would grow further in the coming days, said a statement issued by the Bihar government late on Tuesday evening.He directed officials to take necessary steps to ramp up testing. Demanding more kits and equipment from the Centre, Kumar had also said at the video conference with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday the state would like to ensure 10,000 tests per day from just 1,800 tests per day at present to check the spread of Covid-19.Apart from Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) machine and its testing kits, automatic RNA extraction, Bihar has also demanded 100 ventilators.The chief minister on Tuesday said all the migrants who want to come should be brought to the state over the next seven days.“The officials should coordinate with other states to bring them back. From nearby states, buses could also be used and arrangements should be made,” he added.A senior official said the chief minister wanted a regulated inflow of migrants so that they could be properly screened and quarantined to prevent the spread of infection, as the bulk of the positive cases in the last one week have turned out to be migrants in the last few days. “The problem with Bihar is not the inflow of migrants. Migrants are always welcome home. The problem is that many of them are coming from high-risk red zones in worst-affected states like Gujarat, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Delhi,” a state minister said, adding the Centre needs to put the focus on the state’s concerns before it gets too late.“This is multiplying the virus load on Bihar. By the time positive cases are detected, they have already spread it to new areas,” the minister cited above said.Sanjay Kumar, the principal secretary of the department of health, tweeted late on Tuesday that 15 TrueNat machines would be installed at 13 district hospitals in the state, while 25 more were in pipeline, on the direction of the CM and health minister.“This will help us to decentralise and speed up testing,” he added.The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) had on April 10 validated the usage of TrueNat, a diagnostic machine for testing test drug-resistant tuberculosis, for Covid-19 tests.On its part, Bihar has been treading cautiously in view of the formidable challenge it might have to face.

After the coronavirus crisis, Pakistan’s GDP has taken a hit and its size is estimated to be $284 billion, according to World Bank.In fact, India’s economic relief package for Covid-19 is bigger than Vietnam, Portugal, Greece, New Zealand and Romania.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has hailed the announcement made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying the Rs 20 lakh crore package “is the biggest package India has ever seen”.Thanking PM Modi for announcing the economic relief package, BJP president JP Nadda said that this is around 10 per cent of the GDP and the prime minister’s proactive approach will build a self-reliant India.Japan’s fiscal support stands at more than 20 per cent of GDP, while Singapore, Hong Kong and Australia have each rolled out spending amounting to 10 per cent or more of GDP, according to Bloomberg.While addressing the nation on Tuesday, PM Modi also said that the next stage of the lockdown, which is due to be lifted on May 18 after being extended twice, “will be different in many ways”.“It will be based on suggestions received from states,” he said, adding that an announcement would also be made in coming days.“Corona will be part of lives for a long time. But we cannot allow that our lives will just revolve around the corona crisis.”Apart from some relaxations for industry and agriculture last month, offices this week were allowed to operate with one-third capacity while the country’s massive rail network re-started Tuesday with limited services.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-covid-19-package-almost-equal-to-pakistan-s-gdp/story-aWr9HDBUkwfJK9Gi0mYcnK.html

According to the EOW, the 44 accounts, involving advances to the tune of Rs 7,457.49 crore, were masked by tampering bank software, which left them virtually hidden from the core banking solution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pmc-bank-fraud-hc-rejects-bail-plea-of-bank-director-jasvinder-singh-banwait/story-3V2IYua30XVII066xXTEMP.html

Justice Ravindra Ghuge suggested that if stranded people wish to return to their native places amid the easing of lockdown restrictions, then off-duty employees of the revenue department, who are below 50 years, could be pressed into service to facilitate their movement. The move would lessen the burden on the overworked state police personnel, the court observed.“Police personnel are deployed everywhere. They’re even asked to handle applications for travel passes,” said Justice Ghuge while hearing a suo motu (on its own motion) petition concerning several unconnected issues regarding the pandemic.The court also directed the state government to ensure adequate safeguards for those who are at the frontline battling the viral outbreak such as doctors and paramedical staff.It took note of the threats faced by a staff nurse, who works at Aurangabad district general hospital, and her family members and directed the authorities concerned to file complaints against the accused.The locals had threatened to assault the husband and son of the staff nurse if they did not leave the neighbourhood, as they were suspected of spreading SARS-CoV-2, which causes Covid-19. The family’s car was also damaged.The threats stopped after the local police administration intervened.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/police-under-great-stress-allot-non-policing-duties-to-other-govt-employees-bombay-hc-to-state/story-rbkavam2muGS16ialYjzjP.html

The survey conducted by Child Rights and You (CRY), a non-government organisation working for the children, also reported increased bond between children and their parents as they were able to spend more time together in doing the household chores and watching television.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here During the survey, Rapid Online Perception Study about the Effects of Covid-19 on Children, 1,102 respondents from 23 states and Union territories were interview. It was released on Tuesday. “Even though children have not been the face of this pandemic as they have largely been spared of the direct health effects of Covid-19 so far, findings of the study indicate that they have been among its biggest victims with multiple side-effects on their physical and psycho-social well-being,” Puja Marwaha, the chief executive officer of CRY, said.“More than half of the parents reported that their child became more agitated and anxious during the lockdown,” said the report, adding, “37 percent of respondents reported that the child’s mental well-being and happiness were affected due to lockdown.”Besides, 88% respondents said their children’s exposure to screens increased during the lockdown, with 45% reporting the increase “to a great extent” and only 43% of the parents/ primary caregivers said they always supervised when the child was online.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage About 41% of the total respondents said their children’s eating pattern changed to some extent and 35% said they changed to a great extent. Only around half (51%) of the parents, who had children below five years of age in the household, were able to access immunisation services during the lockdown, the report said.Out of the 1,102 respondents in CRY’s survey, 1,002 reported to have children in their family and 670 reported (67%) to have children in the category of 5-18 years ie in the school-going age.The study found that around 54% of parents reported that they sat and discussed the situation over Covid-19 and lockdown at length with the child, whereas around 47% tried to divert the mind of the child by engaging them in other activities.Also read: India crosses Canada’s Covid-19 tally, becomes 12th worst-affected countryThe study was conducted virtually, with a self-administered questionnaire with around 30 simple questions used. This questionnaire was available for response in five languages – English, Hindi, Bangla, Kannada, and Marathi. The data collection period began two weeks after the nationwide lockdown was announced.However, since access to the internet or internet-enabled mobile devices, and internet literacy were prerequisites for the study, the report said that “possibly the participation from most marginalised and vulnerable sector of the society was limited.”Also read: Army man who tested positive for Covid-19 commits suicide at Base HospitalAnanya Chatterjee Chakraborty, the chairperson of West Bengal Commission for Protection of Child Rights, said the survey reports came on expected line.“We too were anticipating a similar impact on children and launched a helpline for children and their parents about a month ago.

13-05-2020||India||From Rs 20 lakh crore economic package to Lockdown 4: Key points from PM Modi’s speech||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday night announced a Rs 20 lakh crore economic stimulus package for the country fighting the coronavirus pandemic, saying it will give a new impetus and a new direction to the self-reliant India campaign.PM Modi said the relief package, which amounts to around 10% of India’s gross domestic product (GDP), would help all classes, from farmers and migrant labourers to big businesses. He also urged Indians to become more economically self-reliant.Here are the key points from his televised speech:* The state of the world today teaches us that an atmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India) is the only path. It is said in our scriptures ‘eshah panthah’ that is self-sufficient India.* Such a big disaster is a signal for India, it has brought a message and an opportunity. I will share my perspective with an example. When the Corona crisis started, there was not a single PPE kit made in India. The N-95 masks were produced in small quantity in India. Today we are in a situation to produce 2 lakh PPE and 2 lakh N-95 masks daily. We were able to do this because India turned this crisis into an opportunity. This vision of India - turning crisis into opportunity- is going to prove equally effective for our resolve of self-reliant India.* The culture and tradition of India speak of self-reliance and the soul is Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam. India does not advocate self-centric arrangements when it comes to self-reliance. India’s self-reliance is ingrained in the happiness, cooperation and peace of the world.* Friends, this magnificent building of self-reliant India will stand on five pillars. The first pillar is the economy, an economy that brings quantum jump rather than incremental change. The second pillar is infrastructure, an infrastructure that became the identity of modern India. The third pillar is our system, which is driven by technology which can fulfil the dreams of the 21st century; a system not based on the policy of the past century. The fourth pillar is our demography. Our vibrant demography is our strength in the world’s largest democracy, our source of energy for self-reliant India. The fifth pillar is demand. The cycle of demand and supply chain in our economy is the strength that needs to be harnessed to its full potential. * This package will give a new impetus to the development journey of the country in 2020 and a new direction to the self-reliant India campaign. In order to prove the resolve of a self-reliant India, land, labour, liquidity and laws all have been emphasised in this package.* These reforms will be for the rational tax system, simple and clear rules-of-law, good infrastructure, capable and competent human resources, and building strong financial system. These reforms will encourage business, attract investment and strengthen our resolve for Make in India.* Therefore, from today every Indian has to become vocal for their local, not only to buy local products but also to promote them proudly. I am confident that our country can do this.* The fourth phase of lockdown, Lockdown 4, will be completely redesigned with new rules. Based on the suggestions we are getting from the states, information related to Lockdown 4 will also be given to you before 18 May. I am confident that by following the rules, we will fight Corona and move forward.* Friends, in our culture, it is said ‘sarvam atmavansham sukham’ ie what is within our control is happiness. Self-reliance leads to happiness, satisfaction and empowerment. When ethics are filled with duty, the culmination of diligence, the capital of skills, then who can stop India from becoming self-reliant? We can make India a self-reliant nation. We will make India self-reliant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/from-rs-20-lakh-crore-economic-package-to-lockdown-4-key-points-from-pm-modi-s-speech/story-sNqTCwoYUucKvvvR2qDoNO.html
13-05-2020||India||India’s CO2 emissions fell by 1% in 2019-20 financial year||India’s CO2 emissions fell by around 1% in the financial year ending March 2020, which is the first year-on-year reduction recorded since 1982, according to a Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) .The analysis is based on India’s financial year 2019-20 fossil fuel generation and consumption data including coal and oil. The country’s CO2 emissions fell by an estimated 15% during the month of March and are likely to have fallen 30% in April, the analysis published in CarbonBrief, a portal on climate and energy news on Tuesday said. Lower power demand growth and competition from renewable energy may have resulted in this reduction.Coal-fired power generation fell by 15% in March and 31% in the first three weeks of April, based on daily data from the national grid according to the analysis. But renewable energy (RE) generation increased by 6.4% in March and saw a slight decrease of 1.4% in the first three weeks of April. One of the reasons for this is the “must run” status of renewable energy which allows it to reach the grid all the time except for safety concerns.“We have seen that due to reduced demand for electricity during last year most of the drop in share of coal-based electricity is taken up by growth in renewable energy which is becoming more economical with every passing day. The per unit cost for renewable energy projects has come down to below most of installed coal-based power generation in India. The favourable economic conditions (lower cost per unit), being less polluting, better from climate change perspective, must run status for renewable energy projects and increasing installed capacity are the primary reason for renewable energy taking up a larger percentage of India’s electricity demand over the past year,” said Sunil Dahiya, analyst at CREA.The energy related CO2 emissions in 2019 was 2201.865 MT CO2 equivalent compared to 2172.19 MT CO2 equivalent in the corresponding year, according to CREA.“We review CO2 emissions every 2 years because we submit biennial update reports to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). We have an inventory till 2016. If the assessment of this report (CREA) is true we will know later when inventory is updated,” said Ravi S Prasad, additional secretary, environment ministry and India’s lead climate negotiator at UN.Two new papers published in the American Geophysical Union’s journal Geophysical Research Letters found that nitrogen dioxide pollution over northern China, Western Europe and the US decreased by as much as 60% in early 2020 as compared to the same time last year. The two new papers, based on satellite data of air pollution, are part of an ongoing special collection of research in AGU journals related to the Covid-19 pandemic.Such a significant drop in emissions is unprecedented since air quality monitoring from satellites began in the 1990s, said Jenny Stavrakou, an atmospheric scientist at the Royal Belgian Institute for Space Aeronomy in Brussels and co-author of one of the papers, in a statement published in Science Daily on Monday.In one of the two papers, the team found that NO2 pollution decreased by an average of 40% over Chinese cities and by 20 to 38% over Western Europe and the United States during January to April, as compared to the same time in 2019. However, NO2 pollution did not decrease over Iran, one of the earliest and hardest-hit countries. The authors suspect this is because complete lockdowns weren’t in place until late March and before that, other restrictions may have been ignored.Experts said lockdown is a real-life experiment that gives significant clues on pollution control. “We now clearly understand the sources. To continue with good air quality and environment, we need industries all over the country to move to clean fuel, more gasification-based technologies and use of pollution control equipment like NOx scrubbers,” said SN Tripathi, head of civil engineering department at IIT Kanpur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-co2-emissions-fell-by-1-in-2019-20-financial-year/story-kJ2Jus35sKtskGKZk2yhXO.html

13-05-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||In the 10 days between May 1 and May 10 (both included), six states accounted for 91% of average daily deaths from Covid-19 in India. Two of them, Maharashtra and Gujarat, accounted for 66%.The six states accounted for 86% of all deaths in the country arising from the pandemic till May 10, and 64% of all cases.There are states that are registering more cases than some of these states, but in terms of the number of deaths from Covid-19, these are the top six. Delhi and Tamil Nadu see more cases a day, but, on average, have seen fewer deaths in the 10-day period considered. Whichever way you look at it, that is a reflection of the quality of the public health system in these states – they are getting more cases but fewer people are dying. To be sure, there has been some confusion over the number of deaths in Delhi, with the hospital records showing one number and the government bulletin, another. But with a new protocol that requires hospitals to report deaths in time, this should pass (see page 2).Gujarat, West Bengal, and Madhya Pradesh are outliers in terms of the fatality rate – theirs is much higher than the national one (Gujarat’s is the highest). Maharashtra, despite accounting for almost a third of all cases in India, accounts for just over a third of all deaths because of Covid-19 in the country – its death rate is only marginally higher than the national one.Three of the six states – West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh – are also testing fewer people per million a day than the daily national average.As India exits the lockdown, albeit in stages, it would do well to focus on states accounting for the most deaths, and those that are not testing enough. With the focus moving to mitigation from prevention – it clearly has, even as the ministry of health continues to stick to its claim about the absence of community transmission in its briefings – public health systems should be able to treat those who require hospitalisation, and bring down the number of deaths. Widespread testing will help policymakers and public health workers measure the extent of the coronavirus disease’s prevalence, protect the most vulnerable (people over the age of 65 or 70), and track the progress of the disease in India’s hinterland, which is seeing an influx of returning migrant workers. As mentioned in this column yesterday, it does look like domestic flights will soon restart – a detailed note on guidelines for flying, once the lockdown ends, did the rounds on Tuesday. It makes flying cumbersome, and places inconvenient restrictions, but at this stage, just the prospect of being able to fly again should bring cheer to people who have a pressing need to travel (see page 1).The note mentions that the government’s contact-tracing app Aarogya Setu will be mandatory for fliers – earlier in the day on Tuesday, Railways said that the app would be mandatory for rail passengers too (see page 4). Rail services from Delhi to and from 15 other cities restarted on Tuesday (see page 4). It is expected that flights will start next week, although there is no confirmation of this yet.The biggest step towards a return to normalcy came late on Tuesday evening when Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in an address to the nation, said his government would announce, over the following few days, a package for the economy worth a cool ~20 lakh crore. That’s a little less than 10% of GDP, and while the details are awaited (and need to be analysed), if at least some of it is in the form of direct payments, some, credit guarantees, and the rest, government spending, it should help. But more on this tomorrow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-Rsbqv5mfALymd4HBCHhoPK.html
13-05-2020||India||₹20 lakh crore boost for self-reliant India||Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a ~20 lakh crore economic package to help individuals and businesses deal with the Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdown enforced to combat its spread, and to, as he put it, turn the “crisis into an opportunity”.Details of the package, which is the equivalent of a little below 10% of the GDP, will be announced over the next few days, starting Wednesday, by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman. The Prime Minister said the package – Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan (Self-reliant India Mission) -- would cover “land, labour, liquidity, and laws”, industry and businesses of all sizes, and farmers, entrepreneurs, and the middle class. And he repeatedly stressed on the theme of self-reliance and the importance of keeping manufacturing, markets and supply chains local.“When India speaks of self-reliance, it does not advocate a self-centered system. In India’s self-reliance there is a concern for the whole world’s happiness, cooperation and peace,” Modi said, adding that local suppliers have met India’s demands in this hour of crisis, and now “Indians have to be ‘vocal about local’ and buy products from them”.The amount includes the ~1.7 lakh crore already announced — a cash transfer and food package aimed at the most vulnerable — and the measures announced by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The central bank has announced liquidity infusion and targeted credit measures aggregating anything between ~4.5 lakh crore. That means the package to be announced over the next few days will total around ~14 lakh crore.While the specifics of the package will emerge over the next few days, a spate of reports over the past few weeks have indicated the kind of initiatives that may be launched: a large fund for micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs); a well-capitalised bad bank; a loan guarantee scheme for businesses; incentives for local manufacturing; and direct cash transfers to the poor.The ~20 lakh crore package meets the demand of industry bodies — the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) asked for an “immediate stimulus package” of ~15 lakh crore on May 9; the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci) asked for ~10 lakh crore; and the PHD Chamber of Commerce ~16 lakh crore.The package, as a proportion of GDP, also compares favourably with the packages announced by other G20 nations. Japan is an outlier with a package that is estimated to be worth around 20% of its GDP but the US and Australia have announced packages estimated at close to 10% of their respective GDPs, and Canada 8.4%. China’s stimulus is estimated at around 2.5% of its GDP.The stimulus comes against the backdrop of predictions that the Indian economy will contract this year — securities firm Nomura believes that it will by almost as much as 5.2% — and a record decline of 16.7% in factory output in March, when less than 10 days were affected by the nationwide lockdown.Modi said that the virus, while ravaging the world, has also provided an opportunity to strengthen India’s resolve and not waver from its goals. “We are standing at a crucial juncture. This crisis has a message for us. It has provided us an opportunity... we have to protect ourselves and move ahead as well,” Modi said.The mention of land, labour, and laws by the PM presages significant reforms that could make it easier to do business. Already, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh have suspended most labour laws (the former for both existing and new factories and the latter only for new ones) as part of an effort to boost the economy, attract investment, and find jobs for tens of millions of migrant labourers who have fled back home to some of the country’s least developed and industrialised states.A boost in local industrial and manufacturing activity also fits in well with Modi’s theme of a self-reliant India. “The only way ahead is to be self-reliant,” he said. At least some of his meetings over the past month-and-half have looked at ways to boost local manufacturing.In the speech, the Prime Minister spoke of the five pillars of a self-reliant India: an economy that doesn’t grow incrementally but makes quantum jumps; infrastructure development; a technology-driven system; a vibrant demographic mix; and better supply chains to spur demand.The Union Cabinet is set to approve the package on Wednesday morning.Several economists welcomed the package as “substantial” but said they would prefer to see the fine print and disaggregated allocations to gauge the full extent of the impact.“It’s welcome despite the government appearing initially to be hesitant. It has yielded to demands of so many economists and industry alike. The only way to go is to revise the fiscal policy (i.e. loosening government spending) so that economic growth can spring back,” said NR Bhanumurthy of the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy. “The biggest takeaway is the PM’s emphasis on self-reliance. This is a major change in India’s economic policy as we were earlier looking at globalisation. And if this self-reliance is boosted by India’s MSME sector, then we are looking at countering China by its own model. ~20 lakh crore is not a small amount; we need to know where the money will come and how it will be it is a redistributed,” said Abhirup Sarkar, an economist with Indian Statistical Institute.But Vivek Dehejia, a professor at Carlton University, was more sceptical. “The speech was skimpy on bold reforms and there was more discussion of the local, self reliance and Make in India (read import substitution). Colour me sceptical at this point,” he tweeted.The Opposition Congress party said that the PM should have shown greater empathy by addressing the plight of thousands of migrants displaced by the lockdown, instead of just “giving a headline”.“Dear PM, the mammoth heart breaking human tragedy of migrant workers walking back home needed compassion, care & safe return. India is deeply disappointed by your utter lack of empathy, sensitivity & failure to address the woes of millions of #MigrantWorkers!” the party’s chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala tweeted.But, within the Congress, Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot welcomed the stimulus announcement. The financial package announced by PM Modi ji was much awaited. Better late than never (der aaye durust aaye) We welcome this. Now when details emerge, we would know exactly how different sectors would benefit,” Gehlot said.Among a flurry of reactions from members of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) praising the PM’s announcement, Union information and broadcasting minister Prakash Javadekar said that the ~20 Lakh crore package was the biggest India has ever seen. “Aatmanirbharta (self-reliance) is the new mantra,” he tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/20-lakh-crore-boost-for-self-reliant-india/story-LVtoD7PNJ1eWVHsrkJwU8I.html

On May 18, 2018, I developed high fever and other ailments and got admitted at the same ward. Two days later I lost consciousness. I was later told Lini Puthussery was in the same ward,” she said.Puthussery, also a nurse, succumbed to the virus later. Last year the state government instituted an award in her memory; the World Health Organization too lauded her dedication.“I consider nursing one of the noblest professions in the world. Becoming a nurse was my childhood dream. I feel I am nearer to my dream. I have applied to several places (for a job) I am waiting for the call. As a beginner, it is time for me to take challenges head on. I would love to treat Covid patients,” Ajanya says, adding that she is still in touch with some of the nurses and doctors who treated her. She was one of the two survivors of Nipah in 2019, from a total of 19 people infected with the deadly virus. The district medical officer Dr V Jayasree remembers Ajanya and the challenge her illness posed. “A head nurse stayed at the hospital for a week keeping an eye on her every minute. It’s great that she is ready to take up the profession.” Jayashree adds that the fight with Nipah has steeled medical professionals in north Kerala.With no known treatment, and completely blank about the source of the infection, health care workers fought back valiantly. Ajanya thinks health care workers will eventually get the better of Covid-19 too. “Many frontline warriors have fallen prey to the monstrous virus; their sacrifice has inspired people like me and I am sure we will tame it soon.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-s-nipah-survivor-seeks-to-join-covid-fight/story-CR8gRTGeB5fRxlo7S0LpOJ.html
13-05-2020||India||No cabin baggage, inflight meals in draft rules to reopen air travel||Cabin luggage will be barred and passengers aged above 80 years not allowed on flights when air passengers services, suspended since March 25 because of the Covid-19 lockdown, resume in the country, according to guidelines drafted by the government for the first phase of the restart of commercial flights.The draft standard operating procedures (SOPs) proposed by the civil aviation ministry for passengers, airlines and airport operators at a meeting on Monday have done away with the rule of keeping the middle seats vacant in compliance with social distancing norms. Passenger ID checks will also be not required so as to minimise the crowds at terminal gates.Stakeholders in the aviation business,including airlines and airport operators, have been asked to review the draft, a copy of which has been seen by Hindustan Times, and submit their feedback. “It is clarified that suggestions were sought on a draft discussion paper from airlines and airports. The suggestions have now been received.The final SOP is yet to be issued,” said Rajeev Jain, additional director general at the ministry of civil aviation. The rules make it compulsory for all passengers to arrive at the airport only after completing their web check-in at home. The reporting time for travellers at the airport is proposed to be increased by two hours. Only passengers whose flights are scheduled to depart in the next six hours will be allowed inside the airports. Cabin luggage will be disallowed, and only one piece of check-in baggage weighing less than 20kg will be allowed per passenger in the first phase of resumed airline operations.Those aged above 80 will not be allowed on flights. According to the draft SOPs, passengers stopped from boarding a flight because of age or if they are found to be running a high temperature will be permitted to change their travel date without any penalty.Other things such as road transport have to return to normal before commercial flights are resumed, said Sudhakara Reddy, president of the Air Passengers Association of India (APAI), noting that some states want the lockdown, already twice extended, to be prolonged beyond May 17, when it is due to end. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in a televised address to the nation on Tuesday night, spoke of an impending Lockdown 4.  “If domestic air passenger services begin from next week, only a few passengers having personal vehicles will be able to fly as many states have requested that the lockdown be extended, making road transport difficult after landing,” Reddy said. “Only a few destinations will be open for all the stranded ones to fly back to their respective cities.” A full service airline official said on condition of anonymity: “It is too early to comment on the SOP as it is still being prepared.” Downloading the Aarogya Setu app will be mandatory for all the passengers. Only those with a “green status” will be allowed to enter the airport. Airlines have been asked to open check-in counters three hours prior to departure time and close them 60 to 75 minutes prior to departure. Boarding will commence an hour prior to departure time and the gates will close 20 minutes before.Frisking of passengers has been asked to be minimised and to be carried out only if the door frame metal detector beeps. The draft SOPs also ask the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) to not stamp passenger’s boarding pass in this phase. The airlines have been told to conduct a secondary temperature check at the boarding gate before the passengers enter their flight. The document also suggests that the same set of crew (pilots and cabin attendants) be rostered on a flight as long as possible to minimise the risk of infection.Passengers will not be served meals on board. Water will be available in cups and bottles in the galley. The last three rows of the aircraft will be kept vacant for isolation of any passenger who develops a medical condition. Crew members handling such cases will wear personal protection equipment.An adequate number of PPEs will be available on board to deal with more than one such case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-cabin-baggage-inflight-meals-in-draft-rules-to-reopen-air-travel/story-QIAso5NMbCodX2udpKXJ6O.html
13-05-2020||India||₹20L-Cr boost for self-reliant India||Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a Rs 20 lakh crore economic package to help individuals and businesses deal with the Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdown enforced to combat its spread, and to, as he put it, turn the “crisis into an opportunity”.Details of the package, which is the equivalent of a little below 10% of the GDP, will be announced over the next few days, starting Wednesday, by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman. The Prime Minister said the package – Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan (Self-reliant India Mission) -- would cover “land, labour, liquidity, and laws”, industry and businesses of all sizes, and farmers, entrepreneurs, and the middle class. And he repeatedly stressed on the theme of self-reliance and the importance of keeping manufacturing, markets and supply chains local.“When India speaks of self-reliance, it does not advocate a self-centered system. In India’s self-reliance there is a concern for the whole world’s happiness, cooperation and peace,” Modi said, adding that local suppliers have met India’s demands in this hour of crisis, and now “Indians have to be ‘vocal about local’ and buy products from them”.The amount includes the ~1.7 lakh crore already announced — a cash transfer and food package aimed at the most vulnerable — and the measures announced by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The central bank has announced liquidity infusion and targeted credit measures aggregating anything between ~4.5 lakh crore. That means the package to be announced over the next few days will total around ~14 lakh crore.While the specifics of the package will emerge over the next few days, a spate of reports over the past few weeks have indicated the kind of initiatives that may be launched: a large fund for micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs); a well-capitalised bad bank; a loan guarantee scheme for businesses; incentives for local manufacturing; and direct cash transfers to the poor.The ~20 lakh crore package meets the demand of industry bodies — the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) asked for an “immediate stimulus package” of ~15 lakh crore on May 9; the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci) asked for ~10 lakh crore; and the PHD Chamber of Commerce ~16 lakh crore.The package, as a proportion of GDP, also compares favourably with the packages announced by other G20 nations. Japan is an outlier with a package that is estimated to be worth around 20% of its GDP but the US and Australia have announced packages estimated at close to 10% of their respective GDPs, and Canada 8.4%. China’s stimulus is estimated at around 2.5% of its GDP.The stimulus comes against the backdrop of predictions that the Indian economy will contract this year — securities firm Nomura believes that it will by almost as much as 5.2% — and a record decline of 16.7% in factory output in March, when less than 10 days were affected by the nationwide lockdown.Modi said that the virus, while ravaging the world, has also provided an opportunity to strengthen India’s resolve and not waver from its goals. “We are standing at a crucial juncture. This crisis has a message for us. It has provided us an opportunity... we have to protect ourselves and move ahead as well,” Modi said.The mention of land, labour, and laws by the PM presages significant reforms that could make it easier to do business. Already, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh have suspended most labour laws (the former for both existing and new factories and the latter only for new ones) as part of an effort to boost the economy, attract investment, and find jobs for tens of millions of migrant labourers who have fled back home to some of the country’s least developed and industrialised states.A boost in local industrial and manufacturing activity also fits in well with Modi’s theme of a self-reliant India. “The only way ahead is to be self-reliant,” he said. At least some of his meetings over the past month-and-half have looked at ways to boost local manufacturing.In the speech, the Prime Minister spoke of the five pillars of a self-reliant India: an economy that doesn’t grow incrementally but makes quantum jumps; infrastructure development; a technology-driven system; a vibrant demographic mix; and better supply chains to spur demand.The Union Cabinet is set to approve the package on Wednesday morning.Several economists welcomed the package as “substantial” but said they would prefer to see the fine print and disaggregated allocations to gauge the full extent of the impact.“It’s welcome despite the government appearing initially to be hesitant. It has yielded to demands of so many economists and industry alike. The only way to go is to revise the fiscal policy (i.e. loosening government spending) so that economic growth can spring back,” said NR Bhanumurthy of the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy. “The biggest takeaway is the PM’s emphasis on self-reliance. This is a major change in India’s economic policy as we were earlier looking at globalisation. And if this self-reliance is boosted by India’s MSME sector, then we are looking at countering China by its own model. ~20 lakh crore is not a small amount; we need to know where the money will come and how it will be it is a redistributed,” said Abhirup Sarkar, an economist with Indian Statistical Institute.But Vivek Dehejia, a professor at Carlton University, was more sceptical. “The speech was skimpy on bold reforms and there was more discussion of the local, self reliance and Make in India (read import substitution). Colour me sceptical at this point,” he tweeted.The Opposition Congress party said that the PM should have shown greater empathy by addressing the plight of thousands of migrants displaced by the lockdown, instead of just “giving a headline”.“Dear PM, the mammoth heart breaking human tragedy of migrant workers walking back home needed compassion, care & safe return. India is deeply disappointed by your utter lack of empathy, sensitivity & failure to address the woes of millions of #MigrantWorkers!” the party’s chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala tweeted.But, within the Congress, Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot welcomed the stimulus announcement. The financial package announced by PM Modi ji was much awaited. Better late than never (der aaye durust aaye) We welcome this. Now when details emerge, we would know exactly how different sectors would benefit,” Gehlot said.Among a flurry of reactions from members of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) praising the PM’s announcement, Union information and broadcasting minister Prakash Javadekar said that the ~20 Lakh crore package was the biggest India has ever seen. “Aatmanirbharta (self-reliance) is the new mantra,” he tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/20l-cr-boost-for-self-reliant-india/story-4g47UGLGWjyu96p0JsOKEJ.html
13-05-2020||India||Country disappointed by PM Modi’s ‘failure’ to address migrants’ woes: Congress||The Congress on Tuesday termed Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s address as one that gave the country a headline and said the nation is disappointed by his “failure” to address the woes of millions of migrants.Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said the mammoth heartbreaking human tragedy of migrant workers walking back home needed compassion, care and safe return.“Dear PM, What you said today gives the country and the media a HEADLINE,” he said on Twitter.“When the ‘blank page’ is filled with ‘Heartfelt help of people’, the nation and Congress party will respond.“India is deeply disappointed by your utter lack of empathy, sensitivity and failure to address the woes of millions of migrant workers,” he said in a series of tweets.His colleague Manish Tewari also tweeted, “PMs speech can be summed up in one word - HEADLINE HUNTING. A NUMBER -20 LAKH CRORES. NO DETAILS.” Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, however, welcomed the financial package announced by the prime minister.“The financial package announced by PM Modi ji was much awaited. Better late than never. We welcome this. Now when details emerge, we would know exactly how different sectors would benefit,” he tweeted.Another Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said his party had asked for a fiscal injection last month and gave comparative figures of other countries and bemoaned a measly 0.7 per cent of GDP. “If substantially, concretely, new proposal is 10 pc of GDP, it would be great. Both God and devil lie in details, not available. 10 pc should be additional, not counting old pre corona schemes,” he tweeted.Congress spokesperson Jaiveer Shergill said, “Hoping that the Rs 20 lakh crore package is not scripted with same pen which was used to make the promises of giving everyone Rs 15 Lakh, cleaning ‘Maa Ganga’, bringing back black money in 100 days, transforming Varanasi into Kyoto and ending terrorism with demonetisation.” In a big push to revive the economy, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday announced a Rs 20 lakh crore package, which combined the government’s recent announcements on supporting key sectors as also measures rolled out by the Reserve Bank of India.In a televised address to the nation, the prime minister said the details about the fourth phase of the lockdown will be made known before May 18, adding it will be different from the earlier phases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/country-disappointed-by-pm-modi-s-failure-to-address-migrants-woes-congress/story-6tqHRtXf6bwjzCuzxSqSgJ.html
13-05-2020||India||Detection in one hour, as sensitive as PCR test: Debojyoti Chakraborty||A precise and cost-effective test strip named after Feluda, a detective in a series of novels by filmmaker Satyajit Ray, has been developed at Council of Scientific & Industrial Research’s Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (CSIR-IGIB) in New Delhi to detect coronavirus disease (Covid-19) within one hour. Feluda, the acronym for FNCAS9 Editor Linked Uniform Detection Assay, uses CRISPR gene-editing technology to identify and target the genetic material of Sars-CoV2, the virus that causes Covid-19. Senior scientist Dr Debojyoti Chakraborty, who has developed Feluda along with Dr Souvik Maiti, spoke to Sanchita Sharma about test strip. Edited excerpts:How does the CRISPR-based Feluda rapid test work? The CRISPR-based Feluda testing works by combining CRISPR biology and paper strip chemistry. Briefly, Cas9 protein, a component of the CRISPR system, is barcoded to interact specifically with CoV2 sequence in a patient’s genetic material. The complex of Cas9 with CoV2 is then applied to a paper strip where by using 2 lines [one control, one test], it is possible to determine if the original sample was infected with Covid-19.Are you a Satyajit Ray fan? Who came up with the acronym?Yes, I am a Satyajt Ray fan and the name was given by my wife, who is not a Bengali but is well aware of the sentiments. The name Feluda is also an acronym of FnCas9 Editor Linked Uniform Detection Assay.What is the sensitivity and specificity of Feluda? Antibody-based rapid tests have received flak in India and the world over for inaccurate and unreliable results... The sensitivity is similar or sometimes better than quantitative realtime PCR [polymerase chain reaction]-based tests...How long did it take to develop the test?Feluda is not limited to Covid-19. We were working on Feluda for the past two years to develop an assay that can work on detecting any DNA-RNA or their mutations. In end of January 2020, we started working on adapting it for Covid-19How long does it take to produce results?This process of detection takes about one hour to complete if the starting material is RNA, and gives a visual readout on the strip.What will be the cost of each test? Can it be used outside labs in under-resourced settings?At the lab level, the cost of each test is around Rs 500. Our efforts are directed for its use at places with very basic lab setups such as pathology labs, universities, health centres, etc.When will it be ready for the market? What is the role of Tata Sons in it?The CSIR-IGIB is an academic institute. The marketing will be done by industry. Tata Sons has recently signed an agreement with us for the same to take it to the masses. We hope this should be ready for the first phase of testing in four weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/detection-in-one-hour-as-sensitive-as-pcr-test-debojyoti-chakraborty/story-0ETJfLcxG7puojAmQspuXJ.html
13-05-2020||India||With 1,026 new cases, Maha closer to 25k||Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray directed district officials on Tuesday to prepare an exit plan from the ongoing lockdown as the state inched towards the 25,000 Covid-19 cases mark. The state reported 1,026 new cases in the last 24 hours, taking the total to 24,427.The state capital Mumbai neared the 15,000 case mark with its tally reaching 14,947 on Tuesday. Senior officials said the state government is in favour of easing restrictions further in less affected or unaffected areas while continuing the lockdown in red zones such as Mumbai, Pune and Nashik, which have reported a large chunk of the cases.The state has reported 5364 cases in the last four days and seen 190 deaths. Fifty three new fatalities were reported in the last 24 hours, taking the death toll to 921.Even as the numbers rise, the state government is planning an exit plan that has to be prepared by May 15. Speaking to district officials, Thackeray emphasised strict lockdown implementation in containment zones and said that it should not spread out of these areas. The chief minister also said that districts with adequate health machinery should start door-to-door screening of people.“The plan has to come in from all the districts by May 15 based on which the state would prepare its plan and submit it to the Centre. The CM stressed that now the chain should be broken and that there should not be any transmission outside of the containment zones in the state,” a senior bureaucrat said on condition of anonymity.The decision came on a day the state government allowed home delivery of liquor, but not in Mumbai and Nagpur, where the civic bodies have denied permission for alcohol shops to open. According to excise commissioner Kantilal Umap, the order is to prevent people from crowding outside shops.“In view of the coronavirus-enforced lockdown, we want people to remain at home and avoid coming in contact with each other. This [order] will prevent people from lining outside the shops,” said Umap.He also made it clear that home delivery will only be allowed in those areas where the civic body has given permission for shops to be open. “Liquor shops in Mumbai and Nagpur, which are closed, will not be allowed to run home deliveries,” he added.The Maharashtra government had allowed sale of liquor from May 4 but long queues and no social distancing forced then municipal commissioner Pravin Pardeshi to shut shops in Mumbai within two daysA statement from the chief minister’s office said Thackeray cited the example of Goa that carried out a door-to-door survey for Covid-19. “The size of Goa is like one of our districts. They went door-to-door and screened people for symptoms. If district authorities carry out a primary check-up, not just for coronavirus, but for other diseases as well, people would not only get timely treatment but also get cured,” the statement said.Thackeray also discussed measures to revive the state economy and said that though economic activities have resumed in the green zone of Maharashtra, authorities should ensure that there are no new cases, said the senior bureaucrat quoted above. “The chief minister has also asked the department concerned to prepare a plan if migrants do not come back in time. Maharashtra will also have to look at creating its new workforce,” the bureaucrat added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-1-026-new-cases-maha-closer-to-25k/story-7hZxtGA9ulKI5tNHSrT4BN.html
13-05-2020||India||Goa declines nod to prosecute ex-CM Parsekar, 2 officers in mining graft case||The Goa government has declined to prosecute former chief minister Laxmikant Parsekar and two officers who had been indicted by the Goa Lokayukta for allegedly renewing 88 mining leases in Goa “with malafide intention”. The lease renewals were struck down by the Supreme Court and petitioner Goa Foundation had filed complaint with the Goa Lokayukta alleging corruption in the lease renewals. After conducting an inquiry, the Goa Lokayukta ruled that the complaint had been substantiated and recommended that former chief minister Parsekar and two officers -- then Director of Mines Prasanna Acharya and Mines Secretary P K Sain -- be asked to demit office while also directing that an FIR be registered against the trio. Owing to the nature of the Goa Lokayukta Act, the Goa Lokayukta’s findings are recommendatory in nature with the recommendations being forwarded to the ‘competent authority’. The Goa Governor, who is the competent authority to decide on the Lokayukta’s recommendations in the case of the former chief minister, has not accepted the recommendation of registering FIR by ACB of state Government against Laxmikant Parsekar under the Prevention of Corruption Act and Under IPC for criminal conspiracy and for entrusting the investigation of such offences to the CBI.In a letter to the Lokayukta the Department of Personnel informed that the Governor denied sanction for the registering FIR and also denied sanction for prosecution against Parsekar.The Chief Minister, who is the competent authority to decide the Lokayukta’s recommendations with respect to the two officers also similarly did not accept the recommendation for registering an FIR and entrusting the investigation to CBI. While also denying the sanction to prosecute the two officers.In January this year, the Goa Lokayukta in his verdict on a complaint filed by the Goa Foundation found that the officials “have abused their official position thereby causing loss to the entire State of Goa and benefitting only a few mining lease holders.”The Goa Foundation had alleged that the act of the Goa government to renew the leases was an act of corruption. Between January 5, 2015 and January 12, 2015 the Goa government renewed 56 mining leases, 31 of which were renewed in a single day -- January 12, 2015, the day the Mines and Minerals Development Ordinance 2015 came into effect. The ordinance made it mandatory that leases will have to be granted through a process of auction, and the Lokayukta observed the hurry was obviously to avoid the process of an auction. Parsekar denied wrongdoing and claimed he acted on the basis of a resolution of the state cabinet and that he should not be singled out for prosecution since it was the collective responsibility of the cabinet, while Acharya has said he will explore legal options.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-declines-nod-to-prosecute-ex-cm-parsekar-2-officers-in-mining-graft-case/story-0j3f787iAZrhNcNLmA5I0I.html
13-05-2020||India||US provides $3.6 million to support coronavirus response in India||The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will provide $3.6 million to assist the Indian government’s response to the Covid-19 epidemic. This initial tranche of funding from the CDC aims to strengthen and support the Indian government’s efforts to increase laboratory capacity for Sars-CoV-2 testing, including molecular diagnostics and serology, read a statement issued by the US embassy on Tuesday. The funding will also be used to support the development of infection prevention and control (IPC) centres of excellence that can improve the ability of hospital networks to detect Covid-19 and strengthen local health systems through enhanced surveillance and monitoring. The CDC will work with local partners to assist in the development of a strong public health workforce to support India’s capacity to respond to the current pandemic and future threats. “The scope of support will include planning for health emergency operations centres to further strengthen public health emergency management capacities. In addition, the CDC India program will provide technical assistance for the government of India’s ongoing crisis emergency and risk communication efforts,” the statement said.Since early January, the CDC’s India office has collaborated with sub-national and national government bodies to support the Covid-19 response. These efforts have focused on laboratory strengthening, infection prevention and control, health workforce development, emergency management, risk communication, and community engagement. The CDC conducted training courses across India for health care administrators, physicians, nurses, and hospital staff on preparedness and response, infection prevention, laboratory operations, and field epidemiology to equip front line workers with skills to collect, analyse and interpret data, and contribute to evidence-based decisions.The goal of the CDC’s global health response to Covid-19 is to limit human-to-human transmission and minimise the pandemic’s impact through partnerships with country and non-governmental partners to mitigate vulnerabilities. The CDC has a long-standing technical collaboration with India’s health ministry to control HIV, tuberculosis and malaria, eradicate polio, and prepare responses to influenza and other pandemic diseases. Over the past two decades, this partnership has deepened mutual cooperation through the exchange of scientific knowledge and technology. In India, US government agencies, including the US Agency for International Development (USAID), the CDC and other department of health and human services agencies, have provided more than $1.4 billion in health assistance and nearly $2.8 billion in total assistance over the last 20 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-provides-3-6-mn-to-support-coronavirus-response-in-india/story-I672nOhi2HPUvL2LnLsLxM.html
13-05-2020||India||Glenmark begins phase 3 clinical trials of favipiravir||Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Limited has started the process of conducting phase 3 clinical trials of Favipiravir among Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patients in India to test the safety and efficacy of the antiviral drug, the company said on Tuesday.According to Glenmark executives familiar with the development, who didn’t want to be named, the company will be looking at recruiting patients from hospitals in the red zones of states such as Gujarat, Maharashtra and Delhi where the Covid-19 case load is high.The drug, if commercialized, will be marketed under the brand name ‘FabiFlu®’ in India.Glenmark is looking at enrolling patients from at least 10 government and private hospitals from across the country for conducting the trials, and is expecting results by either July or August.“Glenmark is the first company in India to initiate Phase 3 clinical trials on Favipiravir for Covid-19 patients in India. Favipiravir is a generic version of Avigan of Fujifilm Toyama Chemical Co. Ltd., Japan, a subsidiary of Fujifilm Corporation. Clinical trials have commenced and over 10 leading government & private hospitals in India are being enrolled for the study. Glenmark estimates study completion by July/August 2020,” the company said in a statement.Favipiravir is an antiviral medicine used to treat influenza in Japan. What Glenmark is producing is a generic version of Avigan. It has successfully developed the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and the formulations for the product through its in-house research and development team.Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has been pushing the benefits of Avigan and built a huge inventory of it, despite there being no evidence as yet that the drug, which was developed as a possible cure for Ebola, works on curing any disease in humans. Glenmark received approval from India’s drug regulator general on April 30 for conducting the trials.“Several health and medical experts, both in and outside of Glenmark, are eager to see the effect that Favipiravir has on Covid-19 cases. We believe the study results will be significant as there is currently no effective treatment for the virus,” said Monika Tandon, vice president and head, clinical development, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals.In the past few months, after the outbreak of Covid-19, multiple clinical trials have been initiated on Covid-19 patients in China, Japan and the US.“The data we get from these trials will point us in a clearer direction with regard to Covid-19 treatment and management,” Tandon added.As per the approved clinical trial protocol, 150 subjects with mild to moderate Covid-19 will be randomized in the study in a 1:1 ratio to Favipiravir with standard supportive care or standalone standard supportive care. Treatment duration is a maximum of 14 days and the total study duration will be a maximum of 28 days from randomization, which is the process of assiging patients to groups that recieve different treatments. “Our effort is to launch a treatment for Covid-19 patients as soon as possible and control the spread of the pandemic. We will do all it takes to ensure accessibility of the product across the country if the clinical trials are successful,” said Sujesh Vasudevan, president, India formulations, Middle East and Africa, Glenmark.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/glenmark-begins-phase-3-clinical-trials-of-favipiravir/story-8ykNqhJWZhc2pWnAQZBWVN.html
13-05-2020||India||Low-cost ‘Feluda’ test to detect virus in an hour likely in 4 weeks||An accurate and low-cost strip test that can detect the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) within one hour is expected to be available for the first phase of testing in four weeks.Called Feluda, the test is named after a fictional detective created by the late Satyajit Ray, although it is also an acronym for FNCAS9 Editor-Linked Uniform Detection Assay. The test uses CRISPR gene-editing technology to identify and target the genetic material of Sars-CoV2, the virus that causes Covid-19. It has been developed by senior scientists Dr Debojyoti Chakraborty and Dr Souvik Maiti at the Council of Scientific & Industrial Research-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (CSIR-IGIB) in New Delhi.“The CRISPR-based Feluda testing works by combining CRISPR biology and paper strip chemistry. Briefly, Cas9 protein, a component of the CRISPR system, is barcoded to interact specifically with the Sars-CoV2 sequence in the patient’s genetic material. The complex of Cas9 with Sars-CoV2 is then applied to a paper strip, where using two lines (one control, one test) make it possible to determine if the test sample was infected with Covid-19,” said Dr Chakraborty, senior scientist, CSIR-IGIB.Also Read: CSIR-IGIB and TATA Sons sign MoU for licensing ‘KNOWHOW’ for rapid diagnosis of Covid-19The entire diagnostic process takes about one hour, starting from RNA to giving a visual readout on the strip, he said.“Most labs are working with PCR(polymerase chain reaction)-based technology, which is costly and needs a lab set-up. Our paper strip does not require (biosafety) Level-2 or Level-3 lab for testing and can be done in any path lab,” said Anurag Agrawal, director, CSIR-IGIB, Delhi.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Friday granted emergency-use approval for the world’s first CRISPR-based test for Covid-19. Unlike the test developed by CSIR-IGIB, the one developed in the US can only be done in hi-tech laboratories. Its developers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard University, the Ragon Institute and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute in the US are working on a simplified version which they hope will get approved for point-of-care use.Unlike other CRISPR tests that use CAS12 and CAS13 proteins to detect Sars-CoV2, the CSIR-IGIB kit technology uses CAS9 protein (CRISPR-associated protein 9) to identify and bind to the target sequence.“It’s a very accurate and accepted testing method and the advantage is that it can be used in any lab that has the technology. Lab technicians, however, may not be trained to use the technology, but it is easy to train them. With training, there can be widespread deployment across India,” said Dr Nirmal K Ganguly, former director general, Indian Council of Medical Research.The acronym Feluda, wasn’t a coincidence. “Yes, I am a Satyajt Ray fan but the name was given by my wife, who is not a Bengali but is well aware of my sentiments,” said Dr Chakraborty.Also Read: Genetic sequencing takes lead in Covid-19 vaccine developmentCRISPR, which is short for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats, is a gene-editing technology that can be used to detect a specific snippet of DNA from a sequence. It can also be used turn genes on or off without altering their sequence.“Feluda is not limited to Covid-19. We were working on Feluda for the past two years to develop an assay that can work on detecting any DNA-RNA or their mutations. At the end of January, we started working on adapting it for Covid-19,” said Dr Chakraborty.This is the only Covid-19 testing kit that has been developed using CRISPR-based technology in India. Feluda has been licenced to Tata Sons, which will commercialise the technology for Covid-19 detection.Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreak“It uses a test protocol that is simple to administer and easy to interpret enabling results to be made available to the medical fraternity in relatively lesser time, as compared to other test protocols. We believe that CRISPR is futuristic technology that can also be configured for detection of multiple other pathogens in the future,” said Banmali Agrawala, president, infrastructure and defence & aerospace, Tata Sons, in a statement.Each Feluda test costs Rs 500 in the lab, and is expected to bring the cost of testing down from the Rs 4,500 per test for the real-time polymerase chain reaction test (RT-PCR), which is the only available test for detecting current Covid-19 infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/low-cost-feluda-test-to-detect-virus-in-an-hour-likely-in-4-weeks/story-q1Q8ATDRNnwEGuRbhWVI2O.html
13-05-2020||India||Face-offs along LAC with China as boundary issue yet to be resolved: Army||New Delhi: After Indian and Chinese soldiers scuffled twice along the disputed border between the two countries in Sikkim and Ladakh last week, the army on Tuesday reiterated that “face-offs and aggressive behaviour occur” along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China as the boundary issue has not been resolved.“Patrols disengage after local level interaction and dialogue. Temporary and short duration face-offs occur as the boundary is not resolved. Troops resolve such incidents mutually as per established protocols,” the army said in a statement. HT was the first to report on May 10 about the intensifying India-China border tensions in north Sikkim, where 150 soldiers were involved in a tense standoff a day earlier. Four Indian and seven Chinese soldiers were injured at Naku La during a confrontation that was later resolved. Aggressive behaviour by the two sides resulted in injuries to troops on both sides, the army said in a statement on May 10.Scores of soldiers from the two countries also clashed near Pangong Lake in eastern Ladakh last week, as reported by HT on May 11. While a few soldiers on both sides were injured in the scuffle that involved around 250 men, a flare-up was avoided as both armies stuck to protocols to resolve the standoff.Chinese helicopter activity was observed across the LAC, the de facto border, on May 6 after the face-off was resolved. Indian Air Force Sukhoi-30 fighters were on a routine training mission in eastern Ladakh on May 6. “The presence of the Sukhois had nothing to do with the face-off. The weather was perfect for some good flying,” said an official on the condition of anonymity.China on Monday sought to downplay the latest round of aggressive confrontation between Indian and Chinese soldiers in north Sikkim’s Naku La area, saying both countries should jointly uphold peace and handle differences.The Chinese foreign ministry did not share details about the clash but attempted to subtly shift the blame to the Indian side, saying Chinese soldiers were always upholding peace and tranquillity along the border.Indian and Chinese soldiers were involved in a 73-day face-off in 2017 near the Sikkim border in Doklam. The two countries have a long-standing border dispute that led to the 1962 war.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/face-offs-along-lac-with-china-as-boundary-issue-yet-to-be-resolved-army/story-OctnlzRQuxFd1gnYkAxQoL.html
13-05-2020||India||3-member EC panel to look into judgment invalidating Gujarat BJP minister’s election win||New Delhi: The Election Commission of India has decided to set up a three-member committee to look into the Gujarat high court verdict that invalidated the election of state education and law minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama. The minister had been elected from the Dholka assembly constituency in the 2017 assembly elections. The high court on Tuesday ruled that he won the poll through “corrupt practices” after a petition was moved by Congress leader Ashwin Rathod, who lost the election to Chudasama by a mere 327 votes. The petition had alleged several malpractices and irregularities in the election. The EC has now appointed Umesh Sinha, secretary-general at the Election Commission, to head the panel along with Chandra Bhushan Kumar, deputy election commissioner and Vijay Pandey, director, law, to examine the details of the judgment and present it before the Commission “at the earliest”. The Commission has also directed the Gujarat government to “initiate disciplinary action against the returning officer Dhaval Jani,” who oversaw the election. “The proceedings are underway,” states the release. The high court had also made scathing observations on the returning officer, stating that he had “allowed himself to be used as a tool” by Chudasama adding that he “obediently behaved and danced to the tunes” of the BJP minister.Meanwhile, senior Congress leader Kapil Sibal asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to expel Chudasama from the party.Questioning the Prime Minister’s “silence” on the issue, Sibal said if he was serious on ending corruption in the country, he should take strict action against the minister from his home state.“This is an example of how our governments, ministers, Election Commission are engulfed in corruption and Modi ji is silent,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-member-ec-panel-to-look-into-judgment-invalidating-gujarat-bjp-minister-s-election-win/story-nfx9oh7qS9qx8QwXZL43TP.html
13-05-2020||India||‘This summer is unusual with no major heatwaves, say meteorologists||With no major heat waves recorded in the core zones so far and “excess rainfall” across the country, this summer is turning out to be unusual, say meteorologists.Summer sets in March in the core heat wave zones of the north, central and east India, and intensifies in April and May until the first week of June, when the monsoon winds arrive. Apart from the northern and eastern plains, central India’s Vidarbha-Marathwada region, Gujarat, and parts of southern India in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana are known as core heat wave zones, where temperatures rise above 45 degrees Celsius.In western Rajasthan, the maximum temperature even crosses the half-century mark.The IMD predicted above normal temperatures in core heat wave zones this summer. However, the temperature has not peaked to that level yet.Instead, India received 25 per cent excess rainfall between March 1 and May 11, according to the India Meteorological Department.O P Sreejith, a senior scientist with the Long Range Forecast unit of IMD in Pune, said March recorded 47 per cent more rainfall than normal and April saw 8 per cent more.“This is not a usual phenomenon,” said IMD Director-General Mrutunjay Mohapatra.Mahesh Palawat, the vice president of private forecaster Skymet Weather, said there are usually two instances of heat waves in April.The IMD declares a heat wave when temperatures rise 5-6 degrees Celsius above normal. If it is above 7 degrees Celsius than normal, the IMD declares a severe heat wave.Sathi Devi, head of the National Weather Forecasting Centre of the IMD, said there was one heat wave in Gujarat in April but it was not widespread.This month, temperature in parts of Rajasthan rose above 40 but a western disturbance brought rains and pulled the mercury down again.Devi attributed the lower temperatures in the northern plains to the frequent western disturbances that brought rain and thunderstorms.A western disturbance is a cyclonic storm originating in the Mediterranean and traversing across the central Asia. When it comes in contact with the Himalayas, it brings rain to the plains and hills. This is a crucial phenomenon in the winters.Devi said parts of east and south India have also been witnessing thunderstorm activities which have kept the temperatures below the normal.May has seen two western disturbances. Another one is expected later this week.“But the temperature could rise after May 16,” Skymet’s Palawat cautioned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/this-summer-is-unusual-with-no-major-heatwaves-say-meteorologists/story-euOrmESuIh2jLpYlX39kxJ.html
13-05-2020||India||FAC to power ministry: Is Dibang hydropower project financially viable?||New Delhi: The environment ministry’s Forest Advisory Committee (FAC) has deferred its decision on granting forest clearance to two controversial projects --- the 3,097 MW Etalin Hydropower Project in Arunachal Pradesh’s Dibang Valley, and the exploration of Uranium in Telangana’s Amrabad Tiger Reserve by Atomic Minerals Directorate for Exploration and Research.A FAC subcommittee report on April 21 recommended that the Etalin Hydroelectric Project, which will involve clearing 270,000 trees be allowed with a condition that the developer deposits money for wildlife conservation in the area, as first reported by HT. The FAC met on April 23 to take a call on it. According to the minutes of FAC’s meeting on April 23, which were finally uploaded on the Parivesh website late on Monday, FAC has sought comments from the power ministry on the Etalin Hydropower Project in view of the following: the project is delayed by six years and the country’s energy plan may have changed during the period; a large number of hydro-electric projects are pending due to environmental and forest clearance concerns; and the tariff structure of the project was already high when proposed in 2014.FAC has asked the power ministry to comment whether the project is viable in its current form. “It may be clarified that the ministry of power wishes to consider the project for approval in its present form or some other decision on the project has been taken,” the minutes said.FAC also directed Arunachal Pradesh to submit a cost-benefit analysis of the project and to review if trees marked for felling can be left as is because of high diversity of bird species supported by them. FAC asked the impact assessment division of the environment ministry to check if the environmental impact of the project has been assessed and sought inputs from the National Tiger Conservation Authority on this.However, the FAC panel accepted the findings of a controversial Wildlife Institute of India study titled “Wildlife Conservation Plan for Impact Zone of Etalin HEP” and said its findings need to be implemented.Earlier this month, several scientists and wildlife biologists wrote to FAC, warning about the massive loss of biodiversity if Etalin Hydropower Project were allowed to come up. The Idu Mishmi community from various parts of Dibang Valley have also opposed the Etalin project.Twenty-six scientists from 16 scientific institutions in a 58-page peer review of the WII study also flagged that the report has several “scientific biases” and doesn’t reflect a true picture of the biodiversity of Dibang Valley, where the Etalin Hydropower Project of 3,097 MW is planned.But FAC said the representations it got are all similar in content and add no new “scientific, economic or sociological evidence.” “We are shocked to see that the FAC has accepted ‘in toto’ the report of WII by accepting the recommendations of its subcommittee. Besides the seriously problematic parts of the report which our peer review points out, the decision that was based on this study does not even meet the basic mandate prescribed by the FAC in its earlier meetings. It is a truncated study of a few months instead of a ‘multiple seasonal replicate study’. Multiple reports indicate that this is both ecologically destructive and a techno-economically questionable project. From my study, I found that there are also serious threats to human well-being from natural hazards that cannot be stopped by such hydro-electric projects,” said Chintan Sheth, former research fellow with National Centre for Biological Sciences who was part of the peer-review.The Etalin Hydropower Project will involve clearing of at least 270,000 trees in subtropical evergreen and rain forests and in a vital tiger area according to FAC’s own fact sheet.The project is proposed to be developed by Etalin Hydro Electric Power Company Limited, a joint venture of Hydro Power Development Corporation of Arunachal Pradesh Limited and Jindal Power Limited (JPL). The total cost of the project is about Rs 25,296.95 crore, according to the FAC fact sheet. A senior executive of JPL said the company didn’t want to comment because the matter is being considered by the government.“People who are opposing the project are from other districts of Arunachal Pradesh. Land acquisition of the project is complete but we haven’t received compensation yet. Over 250 families here don’t have basic facilities like healthcare and education. Why is the government delaying this important project? It’s a source of revenue for Arunachal Pradesh. Researchers and NGOs have delayed it for six years,” said Rohit Mele, Project Affected People Forum.On the uranium exploration in Amrabad Tiger Reserve, FAC said it wants a clear view from the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fac-to-power-ministry-is-dibang-hydropower-project-financially-viable/story-qmDFONKnHEBrCIi74wZyHK.html
13-05-2020||India||Assam to quarantine all returnees||Assam government on Tuesday stated that while all passengers returning by trains to the state will have to undergo mandatory quarantine for 9 to 14 days, only those who show symptoms for Covid-19 will be tested.“As per Centre’s guidelines, samples of only those symptomatic for Covid-19 will be collected and tested. But everyone coming back will have to undergo quarantine for 9 to 14 days,” Assam health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said.Earlier, Assam government had decided to test all passengers coming to the state, but with trains starting to bring back passengers in thousands, the strategy has been changed as per Centre’s directives.“Earlier we were dealing with very few cases. But the scenario has changed from Tuesday. It will be impossible to test thousands of passengers returning by trains as it will take many days to get results,” Sarma said.The first train carrying nearly 1000 passengers from Delhi to Dibrugarh in Assam will reach its destination on Wednesday. The service will continue daily for another week bringing back nearly 7,000 passengers. The state government has also requested five trains from Indian Railways to bring nearly 10,000 workers from various places in South India and West India.Passengers arriving by trains will be screened at railways stations. While those showing symptoms for Covid-19 will be taken to hospitals, others will be taken by buses to their home districts where they will be placed in facility quarantine.After completion of 9 to 14 days, the passengers will be placed under home quarantine along with other family members. Committees will be formed in each block and village to ensure compliance of home quarantine guidelines.“We have asked all 33 districts to set up quarantine facilities for 2,000-2,500 persons each. But if the number of returnees keeps increasing, we might have to set up quarantine facilities in each of the 126 assembly constituencies in the state,” Sarma said.From May 4 till May 12, a total of 3,597 persons stranded in other parts of the country had arrived in Assam by road using own vehicles and buses. Likewise, 3,507 persons stranded in other states in northeast had returned to the state.“Test results of these persons are still coming. Most of the results, except one, have tested negative and these persons would soon be released from facility quarantine,” Sarma said.Till Tuesday, a total of 65 Covid-19 positive cases have been detected in Assam. While two patients have died, 40 have recovered, 23 others are recovering in various hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-to-quarantine-all-returnees/story-C21ZkT4VwynxOarGKEcwrO.html
13-05-2020||India||Sentence Review Board recommends release of Manu Sharma||Manu Sharma, serving a life term after being convicted of the murder of model Jessica Lal in 1999, may soon be released if Delhi’s lieutenant governor Anil Baijal accepts a recommendation by the Sentence Review Board (SRB), multiple government officials aware of the matter said.The seven-member SRB met on Monday to decide on the release of 34 convicts, including Sharma, who are all eligible for early release. The board’s recommendation has been sent to Baijal, who will either approve or reject it, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.Any convict -- barring one found guilty of heinous crimes such as rape and murder, murder and robbery, murder in cases of terrorism and murder while out on parole -- who has completed 14 years in prison without remission is eligible for early release.Senior officers in Tihar jail, where Sharma is currently lodged, or those in the Delhi government refused to comment on the development. Sharma’s lawyer Amit Sahni said:” There is no official communication on the release. But I have learnt from the media that the SRB has recommended his release.” In November 2019, Sahni approached the Delhi high court seeking Sharma’s release. In his plea, he said that despite spending 23 years in jail (with remission added), and a record of good conduct in prison, the SRB denied his client’s release on four separate occasions in an “unfair and unlawful manner.” Remission is when a prisoner displays good conduct in prison, his/her sentence is reduced. While Sharma has served around 16 years of actual sentencing, he has completed 23 years with remission. The Delhi high court asked the board to consider Sharma’s case for release in its next board meeting, which took place on Monday. The government officials cited above said the SRB met on Monday afternoon at the Delhi Secretariat and discussed the cases of 34 prisoners for early release. The board consists of the state home minister, who is its chairman, and the prison’s director-general, state home secretary, state law secretary, a district judge, the government’s chief probationary officer and a joint commissioner-rank officer of the Delhi Police.Siddharth Vashishta,43, better known by his alias Manu Sharma, shot dead model Jessica Lal, who was tending an unlicensed bar at a private party on April 30, 1999, after she refused to serve him a drink well past midnight. He is the son of Haryana politician Venod Sharma. Sharma’s acquittal by a city court in February 2006 triggered protests across the country, after which the Delhi high court took up the case. The high court reversed the order, saying the lower court ignored or misread material evidence. Sharma was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment in December 2006. The Supreme Court upheld the order in 2010.Responding to the board’s decision to release Sharma, Lal’s sister Sabrina Lal on Tuesday said she had forgiven Sharma. “It has been 21 years [since the incident]. My fight was always for justice. He has served time for what he did. Now if he is free, it does not bother me much. It is fine. There comes a time, when we have to move on. I have clearly moved on. One can only hope that he(Sharma) does not ever repeat what he did 21 years ago.” Prison officials said Sharma’s work inside the prison helped his case for release. He runs a non-government organisation, Siddhartha Vashishta Charitable Trust, that started working in Tihar around eight years ago, and has funded the education of the children of prison inmates. The NGO has also worked towards the rehabilitation of families of underprivileged prisoners. Sharma was transferred in 2018 to the “open prison”, which many officials believed was the penultimate step before his release. Open jail inmates are allowed to step out of prison every morning, work during the day and return in the evening.“The government found him fit to be lodged in open jail two years ago. They considered him a reformed man and sent him outside to work every day. And yet they weren’t releasing him in the SRB board meeting. Considering the media frenzy in the case, it’s a bold yet practical and just decision by the SRB to release him. We hope Manu continues his humanitarian work in the prison,” said a jail officer who did not wish to be named.Another prisoner whose case was put up for premature release before the sentence review board was Santosh Singh, convicted of the murder of Delhi University student Priyadarshini Mattoo on January 23, 2006. No office commented on what the board decided on Singh’s case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sentence-review-board-recommends-release-of-manu-sharma/story-wnoyLB9Q4afdqXkwyPiwzJ.html
13-05-2020||India||2G net services restored in Kashmir||Low-speed 2G internet services were restored across the Kashmir Valley on Tuesday six days after they were suspended along with pre-paid mobile phones in view of the anti-insurgency operation in which top Hizbul Mujahideen commander Riyaz Naikoo was killed along with an aide in Pulwama.The prepaid mobile phones were restored on Friday, but the 2G services continued to remain suspended. Principal Secretary (home) Shaleen Kabra issued an order for the restoration of internet mobile services in Kashmir on Tuesday. The high-speed 4G internet services have remained suspended since telecom services were restored in Jammu & Kashmir in phases. A communications blackout was imposed in the region in August last year when Jammu & Kashmir was divested of its special status.The Supreme Court on Monday tasked a high-level committee of civil servants with deciding on the restoration of 4G mobile internet, responding to a petition that argued the absence of high-speed connectivity had hindered access to the latest information and advisories about Covid-19.Authorities have repeatedly snapped mobile internet services whenever there have been gunbattles between militants and security forces.Officials were anticipating attacks on security forces on 17th of Ramzan that marks the anniversary of the battle of Badr in which a few hundred Muslims led by the Prophet defeated much-powerful opponents in the 7th century Arabia, according to people aware of the matter. Last year also, there were similar reports about the possibility of attacks around the same time. The people said it was decided last week that 2G services will be restored after the 17th of Ramzan passes off peacefully. Since the day passed off peacefully, the services were restored on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2g-net-services-restored-in-kashmir/story-gXa3obS7BKdOXSCSWsi4tI.html
13-05-2020||India||Relief and apprehension among the homebound||Over 8,000 thousand passengers travelled to different destinations on Tuesday as the Indian railways resumed its passenger services after over one and a half months of stoppage owing to the Covid-19 lockdown in the country . HT talks some of the people who took a train journey on the first day of the resumption of rail services. PatnaDhiraj Kumar Jaiswal, a supervisor at a private company at Ghaziabad, was among those travelling back to Delhi with six members of his family including his two children, wife and two relatives.“With offices opening, I have no alternative but to return,” said Jaiswal, who has a masters degree in Business Administration. Jaiswal, 38, stranded at his Patna City home after he came for Holi, and then could not leave when train services were stopped on March 23 midnight. “It was a tough period. I came for Holi festival and got stuck up due to lockdown,” he said. Asked if the company paid him for the period, he said, “I have to check my salary once I reach Delhi. My mobile was also not working.”DehradunOmkar Singh, 20, from Champawat district, was working at a hotel in Vadodara. Singh reached Uttarakhand and was working in Gujarat for two years. “We did not get our salary for the past three months and still had to pay for my accommodation and food expenses. Two years ago, I went to Gujarat empty-handed and now, after two years, I have returned home the same way. I had to face many difficulties to return home, but it finally feels that the situation might improve a little because at least I will be home,” said Singh, after reaching Katgodam railway station in Uttarakhand at 11.30 p.m on Monday night from Surat in Gujarat.KolkataPB Verma, 80, and his wife, Prema Verma, had come to Kolkata to stay with their son, Umesh, a senior employee in a nationalised bank. They could not go back because of the lockdown. On Tuesday, they boarded the special train from Kolkata to Delhi and left for their home in Allahabad (which is on the Kolkata-Delhi train route).“We have a house at Allahabad and had come here to stay with our son during Holi. We were supposed to leave in the last week of April. But we got stuck. Today, I am relieved that I am going back home. But I am also apprehensive as Covid-19 is spreading fast and I am travelling in a train with hundreds of other passengers,” said Verma.MumbaiNafees Mohammed, 55, travelled from Khopoli in Maharashtra,was on his way from Mumbai to New Delhi. Nafees, who works on a construction site, travelled along with four other co-passengers from Khopoli to Mumbai railway station in a taxi. He arrived three hours before departure of the train Mumbai.“I have come along with people who used to work with me. We have been stuck for 50 days and have no way to go. There are limited sources available in Khopoli and I can’t wait to reach Delhi and meet my children. We suffered a lot for 50 days and had little money to commute.” Nafees said.JammuJaved Ahmed, 55, with his two brothers, reached Jammu Tawi railway station on Tuesday afternoon from Goa, where he runs a shop of Kashmiri jewellery and trinkets. They decided to return as tourism in Goa is unlikely to pick up in the coming months.“We three brothers are heading home to Srinagar. We have been running a shop in Goa for the past 18 years but now we have to leave. We are happy that they we will reach home soon. We may have to spend a few days in quarantine but that it is not an issue,” said Ahmed. He is not optimistic about his prospects in Goa. “If the situation improves across the world, especially in Europe, then only Goa tourism has a chance,” Javed, who departed on a Shramik Special train to Udhampur, said.AmritsarRameshwar Parshad Bharadwaj, 24, was worried about his old parents and that was why he wanted to return to Bihar from Amritsar. He, along with his wife and three children, left for his home on a Shramik Express train on Tuesday evening. The train was going to Janjgir Champa in Bihar. He said he has been coming to Punjab every year for the past eight years to work in brick kilns. “Although the work stopped since the lockdown was imposed, we were getting everything necessary to live. We were concerned about my parents at home,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/relief-and-apprehension-among-the-homebound/story-GXApzea6CXndrovfBBIUNK.html
13-05-2020||India||8,000 passengers in 8 trains on Day 1 of railway reboot||Indian Railways resumed its passenger services after a gap of nearly two months on Tuesday with eight air-conditioned trains carrying a total of 8,121 people leaving for their destinations across the country, according to the railway ministry. While three of them left for Bilaspur (Chhattisgarh), Dibrugarh (Assam) and Bengaluru (Karnataka) from Delhi, the others began their journeys to the national capital from Howrah (West Bengal), Rajendra Nagar (Bihar), Mumbai Central (Maharashtra), Ahmedabad (Gujarat) and Bengaluru.Railways also reported 169,039 passenger bookings in 24 hours, after the online selling of tickets began at 6pm on Monday. Officials are accepting bookings up to seven days in advance for the 15 pairs of special trains the government has announced to resume passenger services. “After an unprecedented temporary suspension of passenger train services to curb the spread of Covid-19, New Delhi-Bilaspur Rajdhani Superfast train becomes the first train to resume operations,” Union railway minister Piyush Goyal said, soon after the train left for Bilaspur at 4pm. These premium passenger trains, which have a fare structure similar to that of Rajdhani trains, carried about 1,000 people each. They are being run in addition to Shramik Special services that are ferrying migrant workers stuck in different parts of India due to the lockdown to their destinations.The railways also said a total of 575 Shramik Special trains operated with 680,000 migrants till Tuesday since the beginning of the operations on May 1. Of them, 463 trains have reached their destinations and 112 are in transit, according to the ministry.The stations that resumed passenger services on Tuesday sprang back to life momentarily, though the usual rush and crowd were replaced by people standing in queues while wearing masks and maintaining social distancing. Services have been suspended since March 22.In line with federal guidelines, passengers were allowed entry at stations only if they had valid tickets, and had to undergo thermal screening and use hand sanitizer before boarding the trains. The guidelines asked passengers to arrive at stations at least 90 minutes before their journeys to clear all formalities.At least two states, Jammu and Kashmir and Assam, announced that they will quarantine passengers arriving on the special trains.“All passengers arriving by trains or any other means in the UT (Union Territory) of Jammu and Kashmir shall be 100% tested using RT PCR (Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction) method…all such passengers will be put into mandatory quarantine till test results come out negative,” the UT’s guidelines said.The Assam government, too, made a similar announcement. “...everyone coming back will have to undergo facility quarantine for nine to 14 days,” state health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said. “...It will be impossible to test thousands of passengers returning by trains as it will take many days to get results.”According to the central guidelines, passengers will have to follow the health protocols put in place by the destination state/Union Territory on arrival.“It is up to the states to quarantine the passengers upon reaching depending on their guidelines,” a railway ministry official said.The Delhi government issued guidelines saying passengers reaching New Delhi will be allowed to go home, or to their destinations, if they do not have symptoms of the coronanvirus disease. “The persons who are found mild symptomatic shall be informed about self/home quarantine protocols,” the city-state’s guidelines said. Despite the government’s guidelines allowing passengers to travel to stations in their vehicles if have their tickets with them, there was confusion among some passengers.On Tuesday, the government said only those with confirmed tickets should proceed to railway stations along with a driver. “Police /security agencies would not be permitting anyone else,” the railway ministry said. Laveesh Chandan, 35, said: “I have to travel to Jammu (from Delhi) to get my family back, and have a train to Delhi the next day (May 14). There is no clarity on whether interstate taxi movement will be allowed since I am in Faridabad (Haryana), where the border is sealed.”“The other concern is even if I arrange a private car through a friend to drop me, and assuming that we are allowed to cross the border with my ticket, how will he return without a pass?” The passenger trains will connect New Delhi with Dibrugarh (Assam), Agartala (Tripura), Howrah (West Bengal), Patna (Bihar), Bilaspur (Chhattisgarh), Ranchi (Jharkhand), Bhubaneswar (Odisha), Secunderabad (Telangana), Bengaluru (Karnataka), Chennai (Tamil Nadu), Thiruvananthapuram (Kerala), Madgaon (Goa), Mumbai Central (Maharashtra), Ahmedabad (Gujarat) and Jammu Tawi (Jammu and Kashmir).As passengers who managed to book their tickets heaved a sigh of relief, there were concerns too over the running of these trains.Anand Kumar, a resident of Darbhanga in Bihar, appeared relieved. “I have a business in Noida and got stuck at my home after I came here on March 18,” said Kumar, who was one of the 1,060 passengers who boarded the train to Delhi from Rajendra Nagar in Patna. He travelled to the station from Darbhanga after getting approval from district authorities.But Kerala said it was not ideal to travel in air-conditioned coaches during the outbreak of an infectious disease, and asked the railway ministry to deploy non-AC compartments for long-distance travel.“Health experts have warned that a closed environment is ideal for the virus to spread. We have asked the railways to deploy non-AC coaches,” chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said.(With state inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/169k-bookings-in-first-24-hrs-as-rail-passenger-service-resumes/story-CKrnK0UHL6vRnwL6JzspyK.html
13-05-2020||India||India losing almost a million under-5 children annually: Study||Even as the under 5 mortality rate (U5MR) in India has reduced by almost 50% in the past two decades, the country is still losing at least a million children annually before they reach their fifth birthday.Of these, half a million children die within 28 days of being born (neonatal mortality) primarily due to lower respiratory tract infection, pre-term birth and diarrhoeal diseases, show recent papers published in The Lancet.“U5MR in India reduced by 49% from 83 in 2000 to 42 per 1000 live births in 2017, and neonatal mortality rate (NMR) reduced by 38% from 38 to 23 per 1000 live births during this period. There were 1.04 million under-5 deaths in India in 2017, of which 0.57 million were neonatal deaths, down from 2.24 million under-5 deaths including 1.02 million neonatal deaths in 2000,” says the study published on Tuesday.Air pollution is also found to have killed about 9% of the under-5 children in 2017 when data for the papers was collated.The two papers on child survival are published under the India State-Level Disease Burden Initiative, and have the first comprehensive estimates of district-level trends of child mortality in India from 2000.“It is not like we have not made any gains in the past 20 years. We have. In fact, neonatal mortality rate has reduced by 38% during these years and same goes for under-5 mortality rate that has seen nearly 50% reduction. The government has been focusing a lot on maternal and child care, and we are seeing results,” said Dr Rakhi Dandona, Public Health Foundation of India, one of the lead authors of the study.“However, what this study also shows is that India now needs to have an area-specific plan in place to reduce child deaths as no two states have the same problem and that is why the solution that worked in one state may not work in another. The study has in detail mentioned the risks and other issues that individual states face, and solutions will have to be created accordingly,” she added.Although the child mortality and child growth failure indicators have improved substantially across India from 2000 to 2017, the inequality between districts has increased within many states, and there are wide variations between the districts of India.“There is a silver lining to finding variations within states as it assures that the government is willing to work and has found appropriate solutions to problems they face at the local level, and one district improving exceedingly well means there are workable solutions that can be implemented in other districts, and because it’s the same state, could show similar results,” she said.Uttar Pradesh and Bihar continue to lag behind. The highest number of under-5 deaths in 2017 was in Uttar Pradesh (312,800 which included 165,800 neonatal deaths) followed by Bihar (141,500 which included 75,300 neonatal deaths).The NMR is a bigger concern for India as almost 60% districts need higher NMR reduction to individually meet the global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) targets. The SDGs are a collection of 17 global goals designed to be a blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all. The SDGs were set in 2015 by the United Nations General Assembly, and intended to be achieved by 2030.As per the global SDG target, NMR has to be brought down to 12 per 1000 live births universally by 2030. India’s current NMR remains around 23 per 1000 live births.“Given the inequalities in the burden and reductions in neonatal mortality across Indian districts, a more granular approach at the district level to determine the strategies for improving newborn survival is needed. Without doubt, continuum of care has to be the pivot around which newborn and child survival strategies must revolve but to homogenize all continuum of care strategies and move them all in tandem is a challenge given the varied implementation capacities of states and districts. We must continue to strive to saturate the continuum of care strategies not only in quantity but also in quality. But in regions with high mortality burden, prioritised interventions should be the focus in the short term along with the holistic continuum of care interventions,” said Dr Siddartha Ramji, professor of pediatrics and neonatology, Maulana Azad Medical College, New Delhi.The top three causes of neonatal mortality continue to remain preterm birth, birth asphyxia (suffocation) and trauma, and lower respiratory infections, followed by congenital birth defects.The top three causes of under-5 mortality have been lower respiratory infections, preterm birth, and diarrhoeal diseases, followed by birth asphyxia and trauma.Experts said nutrition for prospective mothers is crucial. “The nutritional status of young girls is very important as they are going to be future mothers and they need adequate nourishment to avoid complications later on during pregnancy. If not during adolescence, they should at least start taking balanced meals once they get married. It helps to have a well-nourished body before one conceives. As we have seen, by the time women know they are pregnant, and access medical care, it is already about 10 weeks, and by then the cells of the baby have formed. Chances of complications are high in malnourished pregnant woman and the newborn is likely to be malnourished too,” said Dr Hemalatha R, director, National Institute of Nutrition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-losing-almost-a-million-under-5-children-annually-study/story-UpyB00QmJkopbmPzpJpDeM.html
13-05-2020||India||Aarogya Setu App a must for rail travel||It is mandatory for passengers to download the Aarogya Setu app on their mobile phones before commencing their train journey, the railway ministry said on Tuesday as services connecting 15 destinations with New Delhi resumed, reversing an earlier guideline. In guidelines for the resumption of passenger train services issued on Monday, the ministry said it advised passengers to download the Covid-19 tracking app. But in a subsequent tweet at midnight, the ministry said: ”It is mandatory for passengers to download Aarogya Setu app in their mobile phones, before commencing their journey.” According to officials aware of the development, a direction to the effect was issued by the home ministry after Prime Minister Narendra Modi met state chief ministers in a video conference on Monday. The rationale, the officials said, was to ensure that only asymptomatic people board the trains. “It is assumed that those who are booking tickets for Rajdhani (Express) fares will be carrying smartphones,” an official said, requesting anonymity.Many questioned the feasibility of implementing the guideline at railway stations, also noting that not all passengers may be carrying smartphones. According to another senior official who did not want to be named, passengers were screened at the entry of the railway stations on Tuesday and most had downloaded the app. But those who had not and did not show symptoms of the disease were also allowed to board the trains. “At the station, passengers were going through thermal screening and we were checking all their symptoms; even those who did not have the app and turned out asymptomatic were not stopped,” the official said. A similar instruction mandating the app may also be issued for passengers boarding flights when they resume, according to draft standard operating procedures sent by the civil aviation ministry to airlines and airport operators for feedback. The Centre has also mandated the app for Indians who are being evacuated from abroad. Passengers coming to Delhi by trains do not need to be quarantined if they are asymptomatic or mandatorily download the app, guidelines issued by the Delhi government said. They will be allowed to go home and requested to download the app “if possible”, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aarogya-setu-app-a-must-for-rail-travel/story-aDz06DoqJLgGA5vMpjzrUN.html
13-05-2020||India||Stuck at Delhi airport for 55 days, German man leaves for Amsterdam||A 40-year-old German, who lived in the transit area of Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International (IGI) airport for 55 days as he could not fly out amid the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) lockdown, left for Amsterdam on Tuesday in a special relief flight after turning down offers to be taken to his home country, officials said.HT reported on Monday that Ziebat was living at the airport since March 18 after he arrived in New Delhi from Hanoi as a transit passenger on his way to Istanbul. March 18 was the day India banned all flights to Turkey to contain the spread of Covid-19. Four days later, India stopped all international flights.Before he flew out of Delhi at 3am on Tuesday, Zeibat was screened for Covid-19 and did not show any symptoms. He was recently served a “Leave India” notice by authorities. In the paperwork before taking the flight with 291 other people, Ziebat mentioned Terminal 3 as his house in India and the Indira Gandhi International airport as the place of his stay in the country, an airport official said on condition of anonymity.Another senior official of the Delhi airport said Ziebart told them on Monday he planned to leave India as soon as a flight was available. “Around 3am, he boarded Flight KL872. There were total 292 passengers onboard that flight. It was a special flight being operated from Delhi to Amsterdam. Because he was eligible to go to Europe, he was allowed to leave. His tickets cost him around Rs 43,000. He paid for his tickets on his own,” he added, asking not to be named.In his self-reporting form, which has been mandated by the ministry of health and family welfare for all international passengers, Ziebart mentioned Terminal 3 as his house and Delhi’s IGI Airport as his place of stay in India. His body temperature was checked and he told the medical staff that he did not have fever, coughing or any respiratory disorder, the officer added.An airport official earlier indicated that Ziebat, who has not applied for an Indian visa, was unlikely to get one even if he did because of a prior criminal record in Germany.A spokesperson for the German embassy in New Delhi told HT on Monday that Ziebat was offered a passage back to Germany, but he declined the offer.Another airport official said Ziebat was issued a “Leave India” notice and “he was asked to make arrangements for his departure from the country.” The notice was served because an international passenger can normally stay in transit for just one day according to Indian laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stuck-at-delhi-airport-for-55-days-german-man-leaves-for-amsterdam/story-Ql7W40huc84MpONmWW4DmJ.html
13-05-2020||India||Bengal transfers its health secretary||The West Bengal government has shifted health secretary Vivek Kumar from his post against the backdrop of a controversy over its handling of the Covid-19 crisis. Kumar is the second top bureaucrat to be transferred after food and supplies secretary Manoj Kumar Agarwal, who was sent on “compulsory wait” amid allegations of malpractices in the public distribution system.In a notification issued on Monday night, the government transferred Kumar to the environment department as principal secretary. Narayan Swaroop Nigam, the transport secretary, will take charge of the health and family welfare department in his place.Following this move, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the principal opposition to the state’s ruling Trinamool Congress, criticised the Mamata Banerjee government and alleged Kumar had been made a scapegoat.“This is called passing the blame on to someone else. Why was Kumar removed when chief minister Mamata Banerjee is also the health minister? She should have admitted her own mistakes. Owning up mistakes does not belittle anyone,” the BJP national general secretary and head of the party’s West Bengal unit, Kailash Vijayvargiya, tweeted. Anirban Ganguly, a member of BJP’s central policy research wing, tweeted: “Having abdicated her responsibilities as Health Minister @MamataOfficial makes her Health Secretary Vivek Kumar the scapegoat.”Arjun Singh, the BJP’s Lok Sabha MP from Barrackpore, wrote, “Didi continues to give competition to Tughlaq and beat him hands down. Principal Secretary Health and family welfare dept. Shri Vivek Kumar, has been transferred as he failed in covering up the lies of WBgov, as was ordered by his boss @MamataOfficial.”Trinamool Congress spokesperson Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar, a Lok Sabha member and doctor by profession, rubbished BJP’s allegations. “It must have been a routine transfer because there is no question of deficiency, negligence, and poor performance on the part of the health department. Our health department is doing better than many other states on multiple parameters.” Some other officials in the state health department said Kumar had fallen out with the state government on a number of issues, including the mechanism for reporting daily updates on the Covid-19 situation.West Bengal has been criticised by the Union government and all opposition parties in the state for its handling of the pandemic, including lack of proper supplies for hospitals and frontline medical staff, alleged fudging of data, low testing rate and high mortality rate.The food secretary was removed in April amid widespread allegations of mismanagement in the public distribution system.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-transfers-its-health-secretary/story-gYa7YkzyiVLO0hwTyV54dK.html
13-05-2020||India||Terrorists may exploit stimulus: FATF report||The global money-laundering and terrorist financing watchdog has warned that the stimulus measures and international financial assistance announced by various countries to mitigate the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic are likely to be exploited by terrorists and criminals by posing as genuine businesses seeking assistance.In a report released last week, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) cautioned that terrorists and criminals will use this economic downturn to move to new cash-incentive and high-liquidity lines of business in developing countries – both for laundering of proceeds as well as funding their terror operations.“In an economic downturn, criminals may seek to invest in real estate or troubled businesses to generate cash and mask illicit proceeds. Criminal groups can also introduce illicit proceeds into the financial system by restructuring existing loans and lines of credit. In addition, corporate insolvency proceedings can free up illicit cash contained in businesses whilst masking the funds’ origins,” FATF said in the first such report since the pandemic forced worldwide shutdowns in February-March this year.The report said FATF members have highlighted that tax evasion and related crimes may increase as individuals and companies facing economic difficulties look to reduce their fiscal burdens.Many countries are reporting an overall increase in cash withdrawals, which FATF said is likely to be used by criminals/terrorists to cover their illicit funds with “redeposit funds” when the markets stabilise. “Banknotes can be used to purchase safe-haven assets (e.g. gold), which are less easily traceable,” the report said.It added some of the countries have also reported an increase in fund-raising scams involving criminals, who have posed as international organisations or charities and circulated emails requesting donations for Covid-19 related fund-raising campaign (purportedly for research, victims and/or products).The FATF said the health crisis is also impacting the abilities of governments and private sectors in implementing anti-money laundering measure as well as international cooperation. Formal cooperation, such as mutual legal assistance and extraditions, are already impacted by the crisis due to limitation or suspension of court operations, and the delayed execution of orders caused by travel restrictions.The anti-money laundering/counter-terror financing (AML/CFT) on-site inspections have been postponed or substituted with desk-based inspections. Pakistan last month got a four-month reprieve for meeting a deadline set by the FATF to counter terror financing as the multilateral watchdog announced a temporary suspension of its activities because of the Covid-19 crisis.Several countries, according to report, have even suspended their decisions to impose monetary penalties on the violators. In fact, some Financial Intelligence Units in lower capacity countries are either significantly “reducing their operations” or even “shutting down completely”, the report said. There are also reports of delay or postponement of prosecutions due to the suspension of trials and hearings.“There are reports that diversion of law enforcement and security resources to Covid-19 responses in high-risk, poorly resourced countries, may embolden terrorists and terrorist financiers in their activities,” the FATF said.While banks worldwide are trying to follow anti-money laundering measures, several countries have flagged an increased activity in non-banking sectors like insurance, online gambling, precious metals, and stones and securities amid a decreased activity in others like real estate and casinos.The movement of migrant workers in various countries, including India, will particularly cause disruption for the money value transfer service sector due to confinement measures and company shutdowns, (the report said?).“Should the current economic situation further deteriorate, there is a risk that financial institutions may re-prioritize their AML/CFL efforts and focus on broader prudential and stability measures,” the FATF said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/terrorists-may-exploit-stimulus-fatf-report/story-S69Up0MO92xOC7CliHX7dP.html
13-05-2020||India||How can Aarogya be made mandatory, Kerala High Court asks Centre||The Kerala high court asked the Union government on Tuesday to explain how the Aarogya Setu can be made mandatory when many do not have smartphones, giving it time till May 18 to file its response and also explain how the personal data of users will be protected. The hearing pertained to a petition challenging the Union government’s notification making Aarogya Setu – a tool meant to trace the contacts of people in case they are infected with the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) – mandatory for when people travel to offices. Since that notification, the government has also made it must for travelling in trains.“There are valid concerns about the mandatory condition on the employers. Many have no smartphones. How do you propose to implement this?,” said justice Anu Sivaraman, while also refusing to stay the order -- a request by the petitioners. “Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures,” the judge said. The bench comprised of justices Sivaraman and MR Anitha. The counsel for the Central government said that they will place a statement on record. “A privacy protocol has been developed. It (Aarogya Setu app) has been recognised as the best app in the world fighting Covid-19 right now. Around 130 COVID-19 hotspots have been identified. Lakhs of people are downloading the app every day,” the counsel said.The Union electronics and IT ministry on Monday released a protocol, defining conditions for the access and sharing of the sensitive personal information people provide on the Aarogya Setu. The collection must be strictly for the purpose of government’s health responses, and the data can be stored for six months, the protocols said.The contact tracing app was launched on April 2 and 96 million people registered on it till Monday, according to an IT ministry official who gave the figure during the government’s daily briefing on the crisis. The app was developed by a team under the Niti Aayog and is managed by the National Informatics Centre (NIC). Last week, Thrissur district Congress Committee general secretary John Daniel moved the high court saying the Centre’s April 29 directive for office-goers to download Aarogya Setu violated the fundamental rights of citizens, and that there chances that the personal data could be misused. “We are glad the court has decided to look into the matter and has directed the government to explain based on which considerations the Aarogya Setu app was made mandatory, especially because a majority of Indians don’t have access to smartphones,” said Devdutta Mukhopadhyay, associate counsel at Internet Freedom Foundation (IFF) and one of members of the petitioner’s legal team. “To make having a smartphone a precondition for accessing essential services like the railways has an exclusionary impact. There are also concerns about the technical design of the app such as its centralised model, excessive data collection and weak anonymization. Today’s hearing was focussed on practical difficulties that will arise due to Aarogya Setu being made compulsory for all employees,” she added.IFF has detailed in a working paper the privacy and security concerns with the Aarogya Setu, which can potentially lead to surveillance, and the lack of legal frameworks that can allow such a tool to be deployed in India.Representatives from the IT ministry and NIC refused to comment on the hearing on record.“The data that the Aarogya Setu handles is secure and keeping these concerns in mind, we issued the protocols for the regulation of the app yesterday. The protocols detail how that data is going to be processed and fixes accountability,” said a senior IT ministry official, who is working on the government’s response to the petition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-can-aarogya-be-made-mandatory-kerala-hc-asks-centre/story-pQxvF6Tb7PPXtAoVMAsGDJ.html
13-05-2020||India||‘India is deeply disappointed’; BJP, Opposition lock horns over PM Modi’s speech||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) hailed Prime Minister’s Narendra Modi’s address on Tuesday even as the Congress said the country was disappointed speech because it failed to address the woes of millions of migrant workers.“20 Lakh crore package announced by PM Narendra Modi is biggest package India has ever seen. Aatmanirbharta (self reliance) is the new mantra,” Union minister Prakash Javadekar said. Shahnawaz Hussain, BJP spokesperson said Modi motivated all Indians all to work hard to make India into a global economic power.But the Congress disagreed.“Dear PM, What you said today gives the country and the media a HEADLINE. When the “blank page” is filled with “Heartfelt Help of People”, the Nation & Congress Party will respond,” Congress’ chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala tweeted.“Dear PM, The mammoth heart breaking human tragedy of migrant workers walking back home needed compassion, care & safe return. India is deeply disappointed by your utter lack of empathy, sensitivity & failure to address the woes of millions of #MigrantWorkers!” he said in another tweet.Earlier, former Congress president Rahul Gandhi urged the Prime Minister to ensure safe return of lakhs of labourers to their homes and deposit at least Rs 7,500 in their accounts.He also urged the Prime Minister to announce an economic package for the small and medium industry to ensure their livelihoods.“Prime Minister ji, I request you to announce steps on the safe return of lakhs of labourer brothers and sisters, who are walking on the streets, to their homes. Along with this, to give support to them in this time of crisis, ensure direct transfer of at least Rs 7,500 to the accounts of all of them,” he tweeted in Hindi minutes before Modi’s address to the nation.The Trinamool Congress demanded more details of the package and steps for migrant labourers. The party’s Rajya Sabha party leader Derek O’ Brien said, “We saw the wrapping paper but we don’t know what’s inside the package. Because he didn’t announce the details. How will this money be raised, will the government borrow, will it raise taxes? The devil lies in the details of the package, for which we have to wait for one or two more days.”Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav dubbed the speech unfortunate and said the speech should have had addressed the distress of migrant workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-oppn-lock-horns-over-pm-speech/story-CPVrCA2AAuudnpPzFC5PgJ.html
13-05-2020||India||‘Have to protect ourselves and move forward’: PM Modi on lockdown 4.0||Prime Minister Narendra Modi has announced that the next phase of India’s lockdown, from May 18, will be entirely new, in a new form and with new rules, to meet the twin objectives of battling the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) as well as moving ahead to meet other national objectives.During his address to the nation on Tuesday night, the PM said, “Experts and scientists have told us that the coronavirus is here to stay in our lives for a long time. But, at the same time, we cannot let our lives revolve only around the virus. We will wear masks, we will abide by social distancing, but we will not get distracted from our goals.” This is why, the PM said, the new phase of the lockdown — lockdown 4.0 — would assume new contours and be based on new rules. “States are giving us their inputs and advice. Based on that, all details about lockdown will be provided before May 18.” He said that he had complete faith that while abiding by rules, the country would both battle the disease and move forward. The PM’s remarks came on the 49th day of the lockdown. In the first phase, which lasted till April 14, there was a blanket ban on all activities. In the second phase, till May 3, there were relaxations introduced, particularly in rural areas, and for a limited set of economic activities to resume. In the ongoing third phase, from May 4, the government — based on a categorisation of areas into red, orange and green zones and containment zones — stipulated restrictions and relaxations in varying degrees. This included opening up of offices to a limited degree. On Tuesday, the government also resumed the use of passenger train services, albeit to a limited extent on key routes.The PM announced that the lockdown will have new contours a day after his detailed discussions with chief ministers on the way forward. A majority of the CMs wanted strict enforcement of the lockdown in containment zones, while greater relaxations in other regions. The PM had said that within a broad national framework, states would take the lead in the battle now — and had asked the states to carefully study which areas they wanted to continue the lockdown in, provide inputs to the Centre by May 15, and emphasised the role of green zones in resuming economic activity. In his speech, the PM spoke about the devastation caused by the pandemic, both globally and in India and its unprecedented nature. “But getting tired, defeated and broken is not acceptable to humanity. While remaining alert, abiding by the rules of this war (against the disease), we have to both protect ourselves and move forward.” The PM highlighted how the crisis can be turned into an opportunity, highlighting how from not producing any personal protective equipment kits or barely producing any N-95 masks, India was now producing 200,000 PPE kits and N-95 masks. This, he said, was an example of how India must strive for self-reliance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/have-to-protect-ourselves-and-move-forward-modi-on-lockdown-4-0/story-4Bnknl724WZG2VeGbsoPGM.html
13-05-2020||India||Stimulus may offer cash aid to poor, credit for industry||The federal cabinet is set to approve a comprehensive economic stimulus package on Wednesday that would offer cash support to the poor and credit guarantees to industry and contain far-reaching stimulus measures for sectors ranging from agriculture to banking and insurance, two officials aware of the development said. The effort will be aimed at transforming India beyond a potentially lucrative consumer market to one in which investors share value with its people and create jobs.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here After approval by the cabinet, at a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the morning, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman will announce components of the economic stimulus package later in the day. Modi said in a televised address to the nation on Tuesday night that the package, together with earlier announcements made by the finance minister and the Reserve Bank of India, would be worth about Rs. 20 lakh crore, equivalent to about 10% of the nation’s output of goods and services. The Prime Minister said every Indian had to become “vocal for their local”, not only to buy local products, but also to promote them proudly “We must make the local as a mantra of our life...The global brands were sometimes also very local like this. But when people started using them, started promoting them, branding them, felt proud of them, they became global from local products,” he said.Also read| Covid-19: What you need to know today“The announcement [by PM] beats most optimistic estimates. Reflects the seriousness of the challenge and resolve of the government to make the crisis an opportunity for India,” said Nilaya Varma, co-founder and CEO of consulting firm Primus Partners.The new measures to be announced by Sitharaman are expected to cost Rs. 16 lakh crore, according to the two officials cited in the first instance, who spoke on condition that they wouldn’t be identified.Policy proposals that will be put up for cabinet approval include raising the foreign direct investment (FDI) limit in the insurance sector from the current 74%, reducing the government’s equity stake in public sector banks from at least the 51% it is required to maintain in them, and labour law changes, the officials said.“The purpose is to position India an as important investment destination instead of an earlier brand positioning that it is a lucrative market with 300-million strong middle-class hungry to consume. Now, this market will be accessible to those who would invest in the country, share value with its people and provide employment to its people,” one of them said.Also read| Rs 20L-cr economic package to Lockdown 4: Key points from PM’s speechBoth large and small industries will get support in terms of liquidity and working capital and the government guarantee the credit flows. The Small industries Development Bank of India (Sidbi) will be the nodal agency for routing credit to micro, small and medium enterprises, the officials said.According to them, the states will get more say on matters of economic planning and mobilising financial resources, but they will have to commit to reforms, particularly in agriculture and the power sector, in which electricity distribution companies are owed Rs 90,000 crore. Hindustan Times reported on Tuesday that a comprehensive economic stimulus package is in the works, including aggressive implementation of the Rs 111 lakh crore National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP). This will also include digital infrastructure to promote online health-care and education. To augment the resources of states, the Centre is already in talks with state governments to relax provisions of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act so that the latter can borrow money to finance the fight against Covid-19. Click here for complete coronavirus coverage The FRBM Act mandates states to keep their fiscal deficit at 3% of state gross domestic product (SGDP); states want greater leeway to borrow because they are strapped for funds -- they have suffered a revenue loss from dwindling tax collections because of the lockdown.Providing food, cash and other relief to the rural poor and migrant workers will be the focus of the coming package, the officials said. While they declined to give specific details, they said the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Programme will be the key vehicle for giving relief to the rural poor. Varma of Primus Partners said the focus on reforms, infrastructure, systems and protecting the most vulnerable sections int the package will pay off in the form of long-term growth. “We will need to ensure general consensus on the reforms proposed so that implementation does not fall prey to politics. Also, capacity of existing institutions to quickly translate this vision to action on the ground will be the key as well as focus on outcome and not mere spending,” Varma said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stimulus-may-offer-cash-aid-to-poor-credit-for-industry/story-rpRbAnm5NhENABKfQ9ps5I.html
13-05-2020||India||Delhi records 13 deaths in biggest single-day spike; toll reaches 86||With 13 deaths, Delhi recorded highest number of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) deaths in a single day on Tuesday, which took the total toll in the city state to 86. The highest single-day Covid-19 toll so far was six deaths, recorded on April 16. To be sure, not all the 13 deaths announced on Tuesday were recorded in the previous 24 hours. And it is likely that this trend could continue as Delhi reconciles its numbers with those of the hospitals, which were this week asked by the government to ensure the timely and proper reporting of all Covid-19 deaths.The bulletin also shows that with 8,431 tests done on Tuesday, the total number of tests in the city has crossed the 100,000-mark. This puts the number of tests per million in Delhi at around 5,200, the highest in India. On Tuesday, 383 people recovered from the viral infection, taking the number of recoveries to 2,512 so far in the city-state. This puts Delhi’s recovery rate at almost 33%, mirroring the national average of about 32%. All of the 13 deaths recorded on Tuesday were in Lok Nayak hospital, the city’s biggest Covid-19 treatment facility, where only five deaths were recorded since March 2 when Delhi’s first Covid-19 case was reported.These, however, were not the deaths that happened in the hospital on Tuesday, but a backlog of deaths that hadn’t been recorded in the government’s official bulletin so far. Last week, there were reports that the number of deaths recorded in the consolidated health bulletin prepared by the Delhi government did not match what doctors at these Covid-19 hospitals were saying, perceptibly due to an accounting problem.After the discrepancy came to light, an order on Monday from Delhi’s chief secretary Vijay Dev asked all hospitals to report their deaths in a timebound manner. New standard operating procedures that were issued required all hospitals to send in their death reports, or ‘Nil’ (no deaths recorded) reports, by 5pm every day. Following this, a three-member death audit committee set up by the government would meet to review the numbers.The death audit committee was set up by the Delhi government to examine the case sheets, death summary and other documents of the deceased before declaring Covid-19 deaths in the health bulletin.“The central government and ICMR have issued detailed directions with regard to the identification and declaration of deaths where the underlying reason is Covid-19. As per this, every death has to be followed by a report sent by the hospital with a summary and a description of the underlying causes. Delhi Government has set up an independent death audit committee which studies these summaries as per these guidelines and declares the number of Covid deaths every day which is communicated by the health bulletin. We have now issued an order to ensure these reports are filed within 24 hours. The hospitals have told us that they were overwhelmed by the incoming cases and were not able to file paperwork and are now completing the same for all their cases. The first set of these reports were filed by LNJP which explains the increase in number of cases there. We are awaiting the same from other hospitals now,” the Delhi CM’s office said in a statement.According to the government health bulletin for May 12, Lok Nayak hospital has recorded a total of 18 deaths (including the 13 announced Tuesday) so far. But two doctors at the hospital, who asked not to be named, suggested the number of Covid-19 infected people who have died at the hospital was over 80.There are similar discrepancies at other hospitals too. For instance, Dr Ram Manohar Lohia hospital has recorded 68 Covid-19 deaths so far. “Of these 51 people died in the hospital during treatment for Covid-19; the other 17 were either brought dead or died within hours of admission to the hospital. The hospital has shared the reports with the authorities concerned,” said Smriti Tiwari, the hospital’s spokesperson. The Delhi government report shows 26 deaths in the hospital.At Lady Hardinge Medical College, at least three people have died of Covid-19, according to medical director, Dr NN Mathur. The government record shows zero deaths in the hospital. The All India Institute of Medical Sciences has recorded at least 20 deaths so far, according to hospital’s medical superintendent, Dr DK Sharma. The government report shows two deaths. Along with the 13 deaths, Delhi also reported 406 new cases of Covid-19 on Tuesday, taking the tally of cases in the city-state to 7,639. This puts the doubling rate in the city at about 11 days, lower than the 13 days recorded at the beginning of the month.This is because of a spike in numbers in May with 200 to 400 cases being recorded every day. Delhi’s health minister attributed this to reports of pending samples coming in. “The doubling rate of the Covid-19 cases in Delhi has come down from 13 days to 11 days and the reason for this is several pending reports – in thousands -- are now coming back,” Jain said last week. Experts say that the doubling rate is a good metric for judging the spread of an infection in the city. “The doubling rate shows how much time it takes for the number of cases to double, which indicates the spread of the disease. We have to aim to increase this doubling rate,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung hospital.It is not just the number of cases that have gone up. The number of people in the intensive care units of the city has also more than doubled from around 50 persons at the end of April to 111 on May 12. The number of people on ventilators has gone up from just five on April 30 to 20 on May 12.“The number of people on ventilator going up does not mean that the severity of the disease is going up. We know that around 2% to 3% of those infected will develop severe symptoms and as more cases come, more people will need ventilators. But why it has not gone up proportionally is because a person on a ventilator will not recover in just seven days and go home unlike those with mild symptoms,” said Dr Kishore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-records-13-deaths-in-biggest-single-day-spike-toll-reaches-86/story-Fc0DYrgO72fii8QPKvUSYK.html
13-05-2020||India||India-China face-offs, aggressive behaviour along LAC due to boundary issues, says Army||After Indian and Chinese soldiers scuffled twice along the disputed border between the two countries in Sikkim and Ladakh last week, the army on Tuesday reiterated that “face-offs and aggressive behaviour occur” along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China as the boundary issue has not been resolved.“Patrols disengage after local level interaction and dialogue. Temporary and short duration face-offs occur as the boundary is not resolved. Troops resolve such incidents mutually as per established protocols,” the army said in a statement. HT was the first to report on May 10 about the intensifying India-China border tensions in north Sikkim, where 150 soldiers were involved in a tense standoff a day earlier. Four Indian and seven Chinese soldiers were injured at Naku La during a confrontation that was later resolved. Aggressive behaviour by the two sides resulted in injuries to troops on both sides, the army said in a statement on May 10. Also read: Army confirms India-China face-off, minor injuries to both sidesScores of soldiers from the two countries also clashed near Pangong Lake in eastern Ladakh last week, as reported by HT on May 11. While a few soldiers on both sides were injured in the scuffle that involved around 250 men, a flare-up was avoided as both armies stuck to protocols to resolve the standoff.Chinese helicopter activity was observed across the LAC, the de facto border, on May 6 after the face-off was resolved. China sought to downplay the aggressive confrontation in north Sikkim, saying both countries should uphold peace.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indo-china-face-offs-aggressive-behaviour-occur-along-lac-due-to-boundary-issues-says-army/story-ADacsyptGXMlPgMvaW6wZJ.html
13-05-2020||India||India slams Kabul hospital terror strike that killed 11 mothers, 2 newborns||India on Tuesday condemned the terrorist attack at a maternity clinic in Kabul that killed 16 people including 11 mothers and 2 babies. An external ministry statement described the attack as “barbaric”.A group of terrorists had stormed a maternity hospital in western part of Kabul and opened fire. A gunfight with security forces ensued. When it ended several hours later, officials confirmed that 16 people had died and an equal number were injured.Counter-terror officials Kabul said 11 mothers and at least two newborn babies were among the dead.“Such reprehensible attacks, including on mothers, newly-born children, nurses and mourning families are appalling and constitute crimes against humanity,” the external affairs ministry said in a statement late on Tuesday evening.“The perpetrators of such heinous acts and their sponsors and supporters should be held accountable and brought to justice. They should be forced to eradicate safe havens and sanctuaries that have abetted terrorism in the region for decades and caused immense miseries to untold number of people in the region,” New Delhi said in an unusually sharp reaction, that one official said, matches the brutality of the terror strike.No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack in Kabul, where both the Taliban and the Islamic State Khorasan Province frequently target Afghan military and security forces, as well as civilians.The Taliban denied they were involved.Counter-terror officials in Delhi and Kabul signalled they would let the investigators complete the probe before arriving at any conclusions. The Taliban had denied involvement in the March 25 Kabul gurdwara attack also. But the Afghan security forces last week busted a module being jointly run by the ISKP and the Taliban-linked Haqqani Network that has strong ties to Pakistan’s deep state. This joint module was responsible for the March 25 gurdwara attack, the Afghan forces had said.Tuesday’s attack provoked Afghanistan Ashraf Ghani to deliver a televised address to the nation that ordered security forces to end their “active defence position” and “return to offensive postures, and resume their operations against the enemy.”Also Read: What the Afghan peace deal means | OpinionWhile the firefight at Kabul’s Dasht-e-Barchi hospital was underway, a suicide bomber targeted a funeral ceremony in Nangahar province - a hotbed of the Islamic State group - killing at least 24 people and injuring 68. There was a third attack on an Army check post in Laghman province.Tuesday’s terror attacks could jeopardise a tottering peace deal signed between the United States and the Taliban in February. But the pact has not stopped attacks on Afghan security personnel and other civilian targets.In its statement, New Delhi said the holy month of Ramzan should be a period of fasting, prayer and reflection. “We call for an immediate cessation of terrorist violence and cooperation to deal with the humanitarian situation arising from the spread of coronavirus in Afghanistan,” the external affairs ministry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-slams-kabul-hospital-terror-strike-that-killed-11-mothers-2-newborns/story-QcY1x3g1QF2zF7s2wqwoaJ.html
13-05-2020||India||Bathinda’s hero: This cop is everyone’s favourite, fans love to draw his sketches||The Senior Superintendent of Police, Bathinda, Punjab, Nanak Singh is admired by all for being a compassionate cop. Along with his team, he is relentlessly fighting against Covid-19. Singh’s team responds to senior citizen’s calls for medical assistance, prepares and distributes food among the poor, and also feeds stray animals.The cop regularly engages with his fans on social media, and shares touching videos of his team standing by the needy. He never forgets to credit his policemen for all the hard work. As a tribute, admirers have been drawing Singh’s sketches and sending him on social media. “Such gestures make us feel special, give us the courage to keep going in this trying phase. Social media helps forge a direct connection with people which solves many problems,” says Singh.Singh’s team also created a short movie to spread awareness about the deadly virus. Dr. Nanak Singh, SSP, Bhatinda Police, says, “With everyone inside their houses locked in, a short movie was the perfect way to warn people about the virus. We showed how the police force has been functioning to curb the spread of the virus, and full cooperation of the public is needed to save lives,” he said.A hunger helpline has also been set up in the district to provide assistance to slum-dwellers, labourers and nomadic families. Singh says, “We don’t want anyone to sleep with an empty stomach. Social organisations have been asked not to distribute ration to the needy directly and instead send goods for distribution to the hunger helpline, which will ensure greater reach.”  One of the most novel ideas of Bathinda Police is an open jail for violators of the lockdown rules. These violators are kept for 7 to 8 hours at SSD School (an open jail centre) in Bathinda, and then released. Our Police ensures that these violators are taught the rules of the lockdown and how breaking them will harm their and their loved one’s health. He says, “ We avoid keeping them in real jails. This concept of open jails acts as a deterrent and make people realise their mistakes.”  Apart from surprising children with cakes on their birthdays, Bathinda Police cares for their staff too. In this scorching heat, water bottles, Vitamin C capsules and umbrellas are being distributed daily to the police personnel. “It is important that the first responders are healthy otherwise the purpose of all our drives will be defeated,” says Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bathinda-s-hero-this-cop-is-everyone-s-favourite-fans-love-to-draw-his-sketches/story-5UZE3RuJU4QOG2WB7UAKJN.html

13-05-2020||Editorials||Boosting the economy||The first part of India’s Rs 20 lakh crore economic package was announced on Wednesday — the second, if one factors in the relief to the poor and marginalised announced in late March, and the Reserve Bank’s announcements in March and April — and it provides some indications on what the government hopes to achieve. That the Narendra Modi government would focus on micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) was a given. Its first package focused on individuals at the bottom of the pyramid. It was only natural that that it would then turn its focus to enterprises at the bottom of the pyramid. The package offers small enterprises easy credit, guaranteed by the State; support for those weighed down by loans they can’t service; and an equity infusion. It also redefines them, removing a disincentive to grow (and be competitive), and reserves business for them by not allowing global tenders for government purchases less than Rs 200 crore. All of these — credit, competitiveness, and an emphasis on the local — flow from the prime minister’s speech on Tuesday.The extension of three more months (June, July, August) provident fund support for businesses and workers — in companies employing fewer than 100 people, with 90% earning less than Rs 15,000 a month — is effectively a 24% wage support to small enterprises, and the reduction in the contribution of both employees and employers in other companies to the provident fund (from 12% to 10%) will provide Rs 6750 crore of liquidity, split equally between companies and employees. Liquidity was another theme in the prime minister’s speech on Tuesday. The measures also tackled the issue of a looming crisis in the shadow-banking sector by providing it with a fully guaranteed Rs 30,000 crore special liquidity scheme, and a Rs 45,000 crore partial credit guarantee scheme. There was also a focus on real estate and power, both extremely stressed sectors.Finally, in an attempt to put more money in the hands of people, the government announced a 25% reduction in tax deducted or collected at source, but only for non-salary payments. This covers everything from interest on fixed deposits to dividend and rent payments, and will result in Rs 50,000 crore more flowing into the system (which people will hopefully spend). This is perhaps the best directed part of the measures announced on Wednesday, and the only one that will help the middle class. More such measures, that either cut tax, or actually transfer cash to individuals and businesses, will be needed to spur demand and get the wheels of the economy chugging.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/boosting-the-economy/story-0UpygrIRFaPauHj64OZ96I.html
