04-05-2020||News||It’s time to refresh old ideas like universal job guarantee||The lockdown due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) is estimated to have tripled the urban unemployment rate in its first three weeks. According to the Reserve Bank of India, a full bounce-back looks unlikely in the near future, and the business sentiment has shifted from negative to one of pessimism.The government’s recently-announced economic package does little for workers in urban areas, most of whom are irregular informal workers. The majority of them – 62 to 85% – have no access to benefits such as provident funds and insurance, which make up the flagship government schemes for Covid-19 relief aimed at such workers.Policies to protect workers are being discussed across the world. Such as the United Kingdom’s payment of 80% of wages for furloughed workers and a universal basic income. Closer home, the Confederation of Indian Industries (CII), has urged the government to provide a fiscal stimulus of Rs 2 trillion, which could support 200 million low-income people with Rs 10,000 each. Many of the proposals being put forward insist on targeted direct transfers, often through biometric identification-based bank accounts. The CII specifically mentions an “Aadhar based Direct Benefit Transfer”.Targeting based on incomes and encashing checks may be easy in economies with broad-based tax and payments systems. For vulnerable groups in India, correct targeting and timely payments are perennial problems. Detailed data is severely lacking. For example, just 7% of adults file taxes, and the available labour force statistics make it difficult to accurately identify unemployed individuals. There is growing evidence of exclusions and omissions, and payment failures and misdirection from the Aadhar-based system even in normal times and in areas where it has been in place for a while.Economists have long recognised the informational challenges of targeted payments. They have advocated job guarantees because they are self-targeting. A needy rural household and a rural landlord both have access to work under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), but the landlord is unlikely to take up digging wells for Rs 202 a day.These reasons motivated MGNREGA to cover all rural households, and the government expects to rely on it to create rural jobs once social distancing rules are relaxed. It is time to be bolder than this. A universal job guarantee needs to be on the table for discussion to cover the many workers who are in precarious work situations across in the country.Even in more advanced countries, national statistics have proved inadequate in recording informal workers outside the organised sector, especially the new breed of self-employed and temporary workers in cities. To understand the value of job guarantee to such workers, the Centre for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics conducted a survey of over 16,000 individuals in India in 2018. It found that, on average, an urban worker is willing to take a 15% cut in wage to get a guaranteed number of days of work in a year.Our survey showed that migrants were much less likely than non-migrants to be able to pay for emergency expenses. They also placed a greater value on having a job guarantee. Although a universal programme would not have overcome the immediate plight of uncovered migrants, it is certainly fair to say that the holes in coverage created by targeted payments have not been adequately weighed in policy discussions.The self-targeting features of a universal job guarantee make it equitable and cost-effective. A 100-day job guarantee at a daily wage of Rs 200 (similar to MGNREGA) would cost Rs 20,000 per person. Let’s suppose all casual workers (13% of the urban workforce of 300 million persons), irrespective of income, take up the job guarantee. To calculate how many other individuals take it up, add the 15% value that workers place on having a job guarantee, and we end up with a daily value of Rs 230. In urban India, 16% of the workforce, including those who are unemployed, earn less than Rs 230 from other works – and suppose all of them take up the job guarantee scheme. From a back of the envelope calculation, an urban job guarantee would cost Rs 1.74 trillion, or 0.8% of India’s annual GDP.Many may consider Rs 200 obscenely low. At Rs 400 a day, the estimated cost of providing a 100-day job guarantee would be Rs 6.6 trillion. In reality, costs are likely to be much lower, because the take-up rates here include government workers and business owners, who place much lower values on job guarantee.Importantly, these costs do not net out potential benefits from skills for young urban workers, 93% of whom have no formal vocational or on-the-job training. A job guarantee might lift some of their despondency, as documented for young UK workers during the New Deals of the late 1990s.At a time of severe economic insecurity, a pledge, not even an actual outlay of 1 to 3% of GDP, is a minuscule sum to restore dignity to those who may have fallen through the cracks. This is not the time for “technophiles” to dogmatically cling on to the libertarian ambitions of targeted bank transfers as an end in itself. Old ideas of job guarantees have value in today’s difficult economic times.Swati Dhingra is associate professor, department of economics, and Centre for Economic Performance, London School of EconomicsThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/it-s-time-to-refresh-old-ideas-like-universal-job-guarantee/story-71ZCvvyVe1mOpU0kzXR2pN.html
04-05-2020||News||Covid-19: What it means for courts and businesses||Much like other sectors, the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has the potential to impact the legal framework globally. It might bring manpower rationalization, closure of business units, disruptions in supply chains and non-performance of contracts and calling-off of projects among other things. This will add to the existing caseload in Indian courts. This requires a proactive approach to insulate the legal system from a possible breakdown.But, every crisis brings in its wake opportunities. Covid-19 can be leveraged to introduce the greater use of technology to improve the accessibility and affordability of the system for litigants. During the lockdown, a few benches of the Supreme Court and high courts successfully heard important cases through the virtual medium. But to make it work efficiently across the country, the process must be intensified and widened to equip every court with the right technology and bandwidth.The use of technology is not low-hanging fruit. Considerable work has to be done in integrating and linking systems and data, harmonising procedures, and creating user-friendly digital structures. For instance, in the United States, the legal system began using technology over a decade ago. It required meticulous planning and implementation, which was comprehensive and capable enough to take care of all possible disruptions the system could cause. Instead of reinventing the wheel, India can borrow from the expertise that the US has.With Covid-19 shutting the country, it will likely bring a groundswell of cases that will focus on force majeure, since the parties involved in contracts may seek an escape-route invoking the disruptions in the supply chain and other eventualities.Under both Indian and English law, force majeure does not simply mean anything outside the control of the parties to a contract. Its meaning and applicability depend on the wording of a contract intended to anticipate unforeseen events and remedies for that. Implicit in it is the possible variance in the force majeure clauses incorporated in contracts. There are possibilities that some contracts might not have visualised such an eventuality or have opted for a restricted narration of the clause.In the given situation, it is important for SC to revisit the Doctrine of Frustration of Contracts/force majeure, and lay down conditions for the applicability of the doctrine, especially when the Indian Contract Act is largely silent on the issue.Much as the legal world, Covid-19 has triggered fear among both employees and employers about the continuity of employment and operations of businesses, which are affected across sectors. Even if the lockdown is lifted in the near future, its impact will be felt for long. Some business entities are already contemplating closing down, others are scaling down, and some, including the public sector undertakings, have announced pay cuts and retrenchment of contract workers.With the quantum of litigation expected to go up, alternative dispute settlement mechanisms such as mediation should be used to solve the cases, particularly related to tenancy, employment, deferment of loans, and the interest chargeable. The cases decided should have finality, with appeals going to higher courts only under exceptional cases. To handle the cases of litigation efficiently, cross-country special courts and benches should also be considered.Covid-19 also necessitates amendments to a number of existing laws to make them contextual to the change. Legislations such as Indian Contract Act, Indian Evidence Act, Intellectual Property Rights, labour laws, Disaster Management Act and Epidemics Act need to be reviewed to align them with the changes in the economic and legal framework.Lalit Bhasin is president, Society of Indian Law Firms and Bar Association of India, and chairman, CII Legal Services Committee and Chartered Institute of ArbitratorsThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/covid-19-what-it-means-for-courts-and-businesses/story-vd0EbbVOFOkSKhUSbDiheP.html
04-05-2020||News||Covid-19: A call to save the planet, writes Valmik Thapar||Our world lies torn and shattered, and all because of an invisible virus that probably was let loose by a horseshoe bat. In our understanding of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), one critical factor stands out. The destruction of wildlife and wildlife habitats led to its creation. It could be from Wuhan’s horrific wet wildlife markets or experimenting with bats in a Wuhan laboratory or destroying bat habitats that led to a crisis where millions are infected and hundreds of thousands are dead.Intermediary species like the pangolin might have helped in mutating this virus and,over the last decade, humans have left no stone unturned to decimate pangolins and smuggle them live into wildlife markets. They could very easily have been the intermediary species.China is hugely responsible for the demand and needs to be shamed across the world. I squarely place blame on its actions. I watched closely its enormous role in the tiger crisis that enveloped India from the 1990s for two decades. I watched its increasing presence in Africa and the resultant decline in Africa’s wildlife. At many international meetings for the last 30 years, it was warned to end its illegal wildlife trafficking and markets. It paid no heed. Many wildlife warriors fought to prevent China from this highly destructive role.But China, as a global economic power, cared little and plunged on regardless in its craze for wild animal parts and associated medicine. As far as I am concerned, this virus is a result of this. This virus is also a result of the actions of all those political and business leaders who did not care. All those who scoffed at and mocked nature’s warriors, hurled abuse on those who served both wildlife and nature.The disrespect that many who serve nature have suffered is shocking. Many of us are now angry and unforgiving. Our warnings over the last 50 years have come true. We have tirelessly strived to prioritise the protection of our natural world. Very few who made policy or took decisions listened. Today, they should be drowning in guilt. Big business has failed nature. Few provide grants to protect it. Corporate leaders prefer to remain ignorant of the ways of nature. Now they have been hit where it hurts most. Trillions of dollars lost, and economies at a standstill. If we wake up from this nightmare, will they learn? Will they shed their arrogance? The less said about our politicians and bureaucrats, the better.I remember how hard I tried to get Prime Minister (PM) Manmohan Singh to create a department of forests and wildlife (which did not exist in the ministry of environment and forests) so that this essential sector was governed properly. The idea was to create a separate ministry over time and allow a ministry of environment and climate change to be independent of it. He agreed with my logic, (10 years ago), and instructed that it should be done. But a bunch of secretaries vetoed him. PM Narendra Modi has not held one meeting of the National Board of Wildlife in seven years. Nobody cares. They still do not realise that the virus they deal with originates in wildlife and is unleashed because of poor governance. They do not realise that India is in dire straits, the economy a mess and life disrupted because of how we deal with the natural world and its myriad species.Prime ministers, ministers, political leaders, bureaucrats, business leaders, and society must be educated, and fast, as nature’s time bomb is ticking. This coronavirus is a warning shot over the bow. Next time around, nature will let loose a virus that will be much more virulent. This global pandemic could have come much earlier. It did not because of the tireless service of both nature warriors and wildlife warriors. These people come from all walks of life, in villages, towns and cities and spend their time passionately defending nature. Without them, we would have no world to live in. They provide the most essential service to the nation, but aren’t recognised or respected. More often than not, they are relegated to oblivion. We need to remember all of them today and salute them.Who are these people? They are, among others, the 150,000 forest officers and forest guards. About 100,000 are scientists, wildlife watchers, wildlife travel promoters, wildlife hotel creators, wildlife photographers, wildlife filmmakers, writers, conservationists, naturalists, village volunteers and non-governmental organisations. We need to celebrate them when we are out of this crisis. The PM must brainstorm with them. You cannot run an economy without a healthy natural world. This virus reveals how easily economic collapse comes. Leaders of the world will have to put forests, wildlife and the environment on the top of the agenda if they do not want to be plagued with more disease and death.Economic recoveries must be green. No longer can we harm the natural wealth of our country or any country. This virus from Wuhan has proved that it can bring the world to its knees. That is the interdependence of the world today. Healing nature must be our call sign. Our leadership across this planet must wake up to a new era where life, the economics of it, the design of it are non-wasteful and non-exploitative and tempered with great respect for nature.Preventing global warming and the climate crisis must be immediate priorities. This virus has revealed how our planet is vulnerable and without healing nature, we, as a human race, will die. Let’s learn our lessons and act hand-in-hand with the natural world. We need an educated and enlightened media that does its homework. We need urgent global meetings of world leaders on forests and wildlife. We need global decisions to close wet markets and wildlife trade. We need to find non-invasive solutions for our future. Enough of diplomacy; it is time to call a spade a spade. Enough of G7 and G20 meets. They need to be re-strategised in light of what has happened.Our mission today must be to create key strategies to protect natural ecosystems, wilderness and all the life that abounds in it. If we do not achieve this mission, there is no hope for our planet’s future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/covid-19-a-call-to-save-the-planet-writes-valmik-thapar/story-wcBSzgzOZTqTL2aIcg6kmJ.html
04-05-2020||News||Enable Make in India to become the new normal, writes Amitabh Kant||The coronavirus disease (Covid-19) crisis has put the whole world on notice. It has highlighted the need for efficient responses to urgently required goods and services. Perhaps never before has there been as much urgency in ensuring the supply of equipment crucial for frontline workers, essential services providers, and the population at large, in such a short time. With the massive demand for personal protection equipment (PPE), surgical and N95 masks, ventilators and testing kits, it has been necessary to look for solutions domestically. And Indian entrepreneurs have stepped up to the plate, and fulfilled the demands through innovation, repurposing, and bolstering the production of essential goods.This is why, going by the response from Indian companies to the pandemic, there is clear evidence that Make in India can be a driving force. Building on the catalysing effect of this concept, the next step is to provide a dependable regulatory framework, and incentivise similar synergies to allow Make in India across sectors become the new normal.As evident from the successes in the health sector, Indian companies and entrepreneurs can recalibrate, repurpose and become world beaters.The manner in which vitally important supplies to combat Covid-19 was made available is a testament to the potential of Make in India. India required 75,000 ventilators, of which just under 61,000 needed to be ordered. Nine domestic manufacturers were chosen to supply almost 60,000 of those, with just one importer being selected for the remaining 1,000. Of the domestic suppliers, Sanray Technologies and Bharat Electronics were chosen for 30,000 ventilators, while AMTZ and AgVa each for the supply of 13,500 and 10,000 respectively. A similar situation is being witnessed in PPEs, where for a total requirement of over 20 million PPEs, 35 domestic manufacturers have stepped up to fulfil the demand, supplying 13 million PPEs. The domestic manufacturing of PPEs has grown exponentially. For masks, of the 27.2 million required, three domestic manufacturers are providing 12.8 million. The production of domestically manufactured testing kits, both reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and rapid antibody testing, has been ramped up. This capability will enhance India’s daily testing capability. Overall, these are huge opportunities for Indian companies to prove their mettle. Indian companies are also at the frontline of developing a vaccine for Covid-19. Between six to eight Indian companies have reached the development phase. Zydus Cadila is said to be working on two vaccines, while Serum Institute, Biological E, Bharat Biotech, Indian Immunologicals, and Mynvax are also in the process of developing a vaccine. Biocon, a leading Indian biopharmaceutical company, is developing two new generation repurposed drugs for treatment and an antibody diagnostic kit. It is also working on a vaccine project with Seagull Biosolutions.Several entrepreneurs have made inroads in helping fight the pandemic.Biodesign Innovations Labs, which makes automated versions of low-cost manual ventilators, tied up with Remidio, a manufacturer of ophthalmological devices to ramp up production from 400 ventilators per month to 15,000 over the next couple of months. AgVa Healthcare tied up with Maruti Suzuki in a collaboration arrangement to develop ventilators, and potentially make 20,000 ventilators a month, up from its earlier production of 300 per month.Saral Designs repurposed from making sanitary napkins to manufacturing three-ply surgical masks, and in collaboration with the Mahindra Group, has raised production to 30,000 masks per day that they are sending to state governments through Mahindra’s Corporate Social Responsibility programme. Qure.ai, has used Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning to develop a solution through screening chest X-rays for abnormalities in seconds, through door-to-door testing, acting as the first point of reference on who needs to be tested for Covid-19.Staqu Technologies, an AI-based contactless monitoring application, has a built-in provision for thermal cameras which can take body temperature from a distance of up to 10 metres. Asimov Robotics has introduced the “Karmi-bot”, a robot intended for isolation wards in hospitals, with the ability to carry medicines and food trays and conduct video calls with caregivers, among other essential features.And these are just a few of the innovators who are taking the fight to the pandemic.The collaboration between India’s best corporate entities and the brightest young start-up entrepreneurs during one of the world’s most critical periods is arguably one of the most positive takeaways for India’s future as a global powerhouse. India’s focus on fostering and supporting the startup ecosystem is a vital input towards becoming a $5 trillion economy. Collaboration, innovation, and the ability to recalibrate and repurpose bodes well for Make in India to be accelerated. If the results are so encouraging in the health sector, then with adequate support and a robust regulatory framework, this can be replicated across most sectors, helping India become self-sufficient and the nerve centre for growth and capability. There is no better time than now for this movement to take off.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/enable-make-in-india-to-become-the-new-normal-writes-amitabh-kant/story-mfpm0Qc4hZCxGUNba655XO.html
04-05-2020||City||Pakistan opens heavy fire in 2 sectors of Rajouri, India hits back||Pakistan on Monday opened heavy fire along the Line of Control (LoC) and targeted Indian posts and villages in Nowshera sector of Rajouri district.Defence spokesman Lt Col Devender Anand said, “Pak violated ceasefire in Nowshera sector of Rajouri district at about 1600 hours (4pm). Pakistani troops initiated unprovoked ceasefire violation by firing with small arms and shelling with mortars along the Nowshera sector. Indian Army is retaliating befittingly”. “Around 4.30 pm, they targeted Sunderbani sector and initiated unprovoked ceasefire violation. Indian Army is responding befittingly there as well,” he added.On Thursday, 16-year-old Gulfaraz was killed, while 35-year-old Zaffer Iqbal sustained injuries in Pakistani shelling in adjoining Poonch district. There has been a spurt in ceasefire violations by Pakistan at the LoCs since March 25, when India announced the lockdown across the country to combat Covid-19 pandemic.“Pakistan has been targeting our positions and villages but we are responding strongly,” said a senior officer of the Northern Command. Indian Army chief Manoj Mukund Naravane on Monday slammed Pakistan for its “myopic” and “limited” agenda of pushing terrorists into Indian territory. General Narvane’s statement came a day after the India lost Colonel Ashutosh Sharma, Major Anuj Sood, two soldiers and a sub-inspector in Handwara during a counter-insurgency operation, seen as one of the deadliest for Indian security forces in recent times.“Pakistan is still following its own myopic and limited agenda of pushing terrorists inside India. Unless Pakistan gives up its policy of state-sponsored terrorism, we will continue to respond appropriately and with precision,” Naravane said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pakistan-opens-heavy-fire-in-2-sectors-of-rajouri-india-hits-back/story-PENOSHa1aO5il5sPPERQ2L.html

The lukewarm response to the state government’s initiative to start industrial activity was the result of unclear guidelines for restarting industrial work. Even in the state capital, no industrial activity took place as industrial associations remained clueless and kept calling government officials for clarifications.The district industries centre in the state capital refused to take applications from industrialists seeking permission to start production.The applications have to be submitted manually as there is no online system for submitting applications in almost entire state.In the next two days, some industrial activity is expected if the government issues clear guidelines in this regard.“No industrial activity took place in Lucknow in absence of clear guidelines from the state government,” said Awadesh Agarwal, president, Indian Industries Association (IIA), Lucknow chapter.“We have been asked to submit applications from Tuesday at the district industries centre. Thereafter, permission will be granted to start units,” Agarwal added.As most of the industries in Uttar Pradesh are in districts that are in 19 red zones, industrialists there did not get permission to start production. “If the state government wants industrial activity, it must issue clear instructions to all district magistrates to allow units to operate in special economic zones and industrial areas,” said Pankaj Kumar, national president, IIA.After the Centre imposed lockdown across the country on March 25 to check spread of coronavirus, only around 7000 industrial units under essential goods category are operating.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/lockdown-3-0-negligible-industrial-work-in-up-courtesy-unclear-guidelines/story-jB7TSdT9VlSwsFlMfv6TgN.html
04-05-2020||City||Civil Secretariat reopens in Srinagar||The Civil Secretariat started functioning from the summer capital of Srinagar on Monday, as part of a nearly 150-year-old biannual practice known as the Darbar Move. Darbar Move, the shifting of the administrative machinery from Jammu to Srinagar in the spring, has a history of 144 years. Due to the Covid-19, employees from Jammu region will be working from their homes, while only a limited number of employees in Kashmir will be attending office in Srinagar.Lt Governor Girish Chander Murmu inspected the ceremonial guard of honour at the civil secretariat lawns as offices opened here after closing in Jammu in the last week of April. “He also interacted with the officers and sought their suggestions for further improving the public delivery mechanism, besides advising them to continue working with dedication for the welfare of the public,” a spokesperson said.The L-G also reiterated the government’s resolve of working tirelessly towards ensuring a responsive and accountable government and good governance at all levels. The annual “Darbar Move” was started by the erstwhile Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir, Ranbir Singh, in 1872. However, 33 years ago, when former chief minister Farooq Abdullah tried to end the annual shifting, protests by a cross-section of society in Jammu forced him to change his mind.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/civil-secretariat-reopens-in-srinagar/story-pjAfUjsV0VSHQWq4Gs8aLM.html
04-05-2020||Mumbai||No trains from Mumbai to other states in near future, says govt||The state government has clarified that there will be no special trains plying from Mumbai to other states in the near future and that the responsibility of carrying out health check-up of migrants returning to their hometowns lies with the respective states.In a video conference with the media on Monday, Bhushan Gagrani, principal secretary of state government, said travel of people from red zones is still prohibited. “We have already sent 35,000 migrants to their respective states in trains and buses. A few trains were sent to Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh from Nashik and other places, but the same cannot be done from Mumbai as it is a largely affected red zone. If the respective states are willing to arrange for logistics for their travel by road we are giving them permissions,” Gagrani said.He said district authorities have been directed to collect information from migrants to avoid last minute hassle. While talking about health check-up of migrants for Covid-19 infection, Gagrani said migrants in shelter camps have been going through regular check-ups. “If they are asymptomatic, there is no need to conduct tests on them. The states receiving them should conduct tests if they find symptoms,” he said.State minority affairs minister and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Nawab Malik alleged that the Uttar Pradesh government was not willing to take their citizens, who are stranded in Maharashtra, back. “There are at least 25 people hailing from UP who are stuck in Maharashtra. The UP government is dilly-dallying the process of giving permissions for their journey demanding to conduct Covid-19 tests on them. Performing tests on such large number of people may take at least one-and-a-half year. While other states like Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh have given permissions, UP has been indulging in the delay tactics as they do not want take back these people,” he said.State Congress has announced to bear the travelling expenses of migrants stuck in Maharashtra. The party’s state unit chief Balasaheb Thorat said as announced by the party president Sonia Gandhi, the Maharashtra unit has taken decision to bear the ticket cost of the migrants who wish to go back.Meanwhile, the state government has written to the Centre for a special train for 1,069 students from the state who are stuck in Delhi. Most of the stranded students are enrolled with institutions tutoring for civil service examinations. According to the officials from the disaster management cell, they are expecting the arrangement for the special train in next few days.Govt refutes allegation of negligence in sending stranded Sikh pilgrimsMaharashtra government has refuted the charges of negligence by state authorities in Nanded while sending Sikh pilgrims stranded in Hazur Sahib Gurudwara. “We have been regularly checking up on these pilgrims at Gurudwara for symptoms as per the protocol set by the Central government. We were not expected to conduct the tests on them. In fact, our proposal of sending 10 buses daily to avoid crowding was turned down by the Punjab government. 75 buses were sent to Nanded to fetch the pilgrims,” said Nitin Kareer, additional chief secretary, Maharashtra government.Punjab Health minister Balbir S Sidhu alleged they were facing problems of more positive patients as Maharashtra government did not conduct tests on the pilgrims. “Had they conducted tests and informed us about the results, we would have treated them accordingly,” he told an agency in Punjab.Another official from Nanded collectorate said the blame-game is meaningless as nobody among the more than 3,000 stranded pilgrims had the symptoms. “They contracted the infection during their travel which has led to more people testing positive in Nanded due to spread of the virus through drivers,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/no-trains-from-mumbai-to-other-states-in-near-future-says-govt/story-oIAblZsczR8j1hbfrSo5FN.html
04-05-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh education department says payment of school fee not mandatory||Even after majority private schools in Chandigarh refused to pay salaries to employees for April, the Chandigarh education department stood on its ground and decided that the schools cannot force parents to pay fee amid lockdown due to the coronavirus outbreak.Director of school education, Chandigarh, Rubinderjit Singh Brar, while confirming the developments said, “The UT education Department stands with its previous order on fee collection. Parents cannot be forced by the schools to deposit the fee mandatorily, however, if any parent willingly wants to submit the dues, there is no bar on that.”The UT education department had deferred the payment of tuition fee for the 2020-21 session in government and private schools owing to the lockdown. The order said that the dates for fee collection will be announced after the schools reopen and a month’s time will be given for the payment to the parents.Citing lacks of funds in absence of fee collection, 50 of 77 private schools in Chandigarh said that they will not be paying salaries to teachers and Class 4 employees for April.The chairman of the Independent Schools Association (ISA), HS Mamik, said that the salaries of the staff will be delayed till the time the collection of the fee is not permitted under such circumstances.Questioning who gave the education department the authority to stop schools from collecting the fee, Mamik said, “It is highly unfair. We are left with no choice but to approach the Punjab and Haryana high court as soon as possible.”Due to the tussle between the private schools and the education department, around 12,000 teachers and 7,000 Class 4 employees working in private schools in Chandigarh are getting impacted. After repeated complaints regarding fee collection against various city schools by parents, the education department had asked all the private unaided schools to display their balance sheet online by March 30. However, none of the schools complied with the directions. Explanation calls were also made to over 15 schools by the education department.Chandigarh Parents’ Association president Nitin Goyal said, “If balance sheets of any school reveal that the school management is short of funds for paying salaries to its staff, those particular schools should be allowed to charge a reduced fee so as to cover the salaries of teachers and other employees only.” However, he added that parents should not be burdened with the fat salaries of the top management and trustees as they are already very well-off and financially secure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-education-department-says-payment-of-school-fee-not-mandatory/story-MEb8M3iNv85dO2po9d6AfP.html

They have been strictly forbidden from smoking and chewing tobacco in offices.A meeting was held in this regard on Monday to work out the modalities for opening of government offices, though no schedule was announced.An advisory was also issued for the employees to sit at a distance of two metres. Flexible office timings have been recommended, with suspension of signing-in on biometrics. The head of department has been told to keep record of all employees coming to work.The directions included doing as much work as possible through telephone, SMS, WhatsApp and all officials meetings to be held through video conferencing.The instructions have also mandated thermal scanning of employees, no use of air-conditioners, availability of hand sanitisers at all strategic points, and disinfection of offices at regular intervals. Employees have been told to avoid leather bags and bring items of daily need in a cotton bag which can be washed on reaching home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/govt-employees-told-to-wear-clothes-covering-full-body/story-xmUUoLNE4ZPHnvXcedJRBJ.html
04-05-2020||City||SC reserves order on pleas seeking restoration of 4G internet services in J-K||The Supreme Court on Monday reserved its order on a batch of petitions seeking restoration of 4G internet services in Jammu and Kashmir claiming the 2G service available in the Union Territory (UT) is not sufficient for education and business purposes amid the ongoing coronavirus-induced lockdown.A three-judge bench headed by Justice NV Ramana said that it is taking into consideration all the issues in the matter and that it does not require any additional material in the case. “We will pass appropriate orders in the case,” Justice Ramana said. During the hearing, attorney general KK Venugopal appearing for the central government said the orders that have been passed specifically stated that restrictions of internet speed are required for national security. Venugopal said that it’s about the protection of the lives of the entirety of the population of Jammu and Kashmir and not just the Covid-19 patients.“Terrorists are being pushed into the country. Yesterday, there were some tragic events also. These men could easily take videos of the troop movements because they were trusted. The enemy could know the troop movements if they had 4G,” Venugopal told the court.The attorney general said that the petitions have to be examined against the larger public interest of national security, adding that national security is paramount and those tasked with protecting national security must be the sole judges in the matter. “The matters of policy decision cannot be interfered with by the court. It must be left to the government,” Venugopal added.Lawyer Huzefa Ahmadi, appearing for one of the petitioners, told the court that the Covid-19 situation in J&K has worsened and added that problems are being faced by doctors, who cannot access necessary information about coronavirus treatment due to the internet speed.75 doctors have also made a representation flagging the same concerns, Ahmadi said. Justice Ramana said that the government is saying the people can rely on the landline broadband connection, to which Ahmadi responded by saying broadband connections account for less than one percent of the total internet connections in J&K.“There are around approximately 1 lakh 32 thousand broadband landline connections in J&K, but more than one crore phone/internet connections. The total number of broadband connections in J&K account for less than 1 percent of the total internet connections,” he said. Justice BR Gavai, another judge in the bench, said that the numbers are not in dispute but it’s a legal question of balance and the government is raising security concerns.Justice Ramana said that the central government is claiming that there has been a surge in terrorist activities and they have collaborated via 4G. Ahmadi responded by saying that the terrorist activities were more in the 1990s when there was no internet at all.Ahmadi submitted that the Centre is arguing that the national security may be compromised, but they have not been able to show any direct nexus in the case. Let them open internet speeds for a week and see if there is any nexus with terrorism, Ahmadi said. Senior lawyer Salman Khurshid, appearing for another petitioner in the matter, said that private schools are under government directions to provide education via video-conferencing. We have an obligation under the Right to Education to provide education, Khurshid said. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said that the central government had started with a complete lockdown and then brought in relaxations by allowing movement, followed by landline and then 2G internet services.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sc-reserves-order-on-pleas-seeking-restoration-of-4g-internet-services-in-j-k/story-Z11JvpPumenNR3ZhTmJnGO.html
04-05-2020||Mumbai||Scores queue up but most liquor stores remain shut||The city and its neighbouring Thane, Kalyan and Navi Mumbai woke up to long queues outside liquor shops, as the state government allowed alcohol and non-essential stores to open from Monday. Despite the queues and nod, a majority of the shops, however, remained shut as the permission letters came only after 2pm. Most of them decided to start business from Tuesday.The Maharashtra government has allowed standalone liquor wholesale and retail shops to run even in red zones from 10am to 6pm. The shops will have ensure to six-feet distance between two people and not allow more than five people at a time. “As there was hardly any time, we decided to start the operations from Tuesday,” said Naresh Shetty, owner, Bombay Wine Merchants at Lalbaug. “We will get bouncers to control the crowd. They will be briefed on the measures to be followed.”The excise department said there was a delay in issuing approvals owing to staff crunch. “We are facing shortage of manpower,” said excise commissioner Kantilal Umap.Consumers, however, were disappointed. “I woke up early and stood in a queue from 6am,” said Raju Jaal, a resident of Byculla.With the crowds amid the outbreak, the police had to intervene and disperse them to ensure social distance is maintained. Some citizens even complained about the flouting of norms in Chembur, Sion and IC Colony in Borivli on Mumbai Police’s Twitter handle.SHOPS WON’T OPEN IN KALYAN-DOMBIVLI, NAVI MUMBAIIn Kalyan-Dombivli, municipal commissioner Vijay Suryavanshi released a statement saying only shops selling essential commodities will be allowed to open. “There is no change in the earlier rules. Liquor shops or any other non-essential shops will not open until the Thane collector directs it,” said Suryavanshi.A video of at least 40 people waiting in a queue outside a liquor shop in Dombivli (East), however, went viral. “There was a lot of confusion among residents as messages on social media said liquor shops will open from Monday morning,” said Amey Joshi, 36, a resident of Vishnu Nagar, Dombivli (West). The Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation announced that permission will not be given to private offices and liquor shops in the city to open till May 17. The civic body has also asked those working in Mumbai or APMC to make accommodation arrangements at their place of work.Navi Mumbai municipal commissioner Annasaheb Misal said, “MMR includes Navi Mumbai which is a red zone. Hence there will be no relaxation in the city.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/scores-queue-up-but-most-liquor-stores-remain-shut/story-keyWH8CJtFLc5VCHz53RfO.html
04-05-2020||Mumbai||BMC chief: Only admit those who show symptoms to hospitals||Civic chief Praveen Pardeshi, in a circular on Monday, asked all Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) officials including ward and hospital staffers to strictly adhere to the guidelines of admitting only symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with comorbidities in dedicated Covid-19 hospitals. He further directed that asymptomatic patients without comorbidities or patents showing mild symptoms are to be admitted in Covid care centres and Covid health centres. The circular stated that several hospital managements are being pressurised by health worker unions to admit asymptomatic patients in hospitals.Further, in a video conference with all ward officials on Monday, Pardeshi reiterated that guidelines should be strictly followed. A BMC official said, “There are several instances of asymptomatic patients being admitted in hospitals, which may lead to delay in getting bed for symptomatic patients. Hence, we have been asked to strictly follow the guidelines on admission of patients.”The circular has pointed out that as per the guidelines issued by the Central government for managing Covid-19 patients all asymptomatic positive patients are to be kept in corona care centres (CCC), moderately symptomatic positive patients in dedicated Covid health centre (DCHC), and critical Covid positive patients with comorbidities in dedicated Covid hospitals (DCH). The circular reads, “However, it has been brought to notice that various unions of health workers, medical practitioners etc. are pressurising hospital management to admit asymptomatic Covid positive patients in facilities which should be ideally used for symptomatic patients and asymptomatic patients with comorbidities. Therefore, once again it is reiterated that DCH and DHCH facilities should be used only for symptomatic patients and asymptomatic patients with comorbidities. These guidelines are to be followed strictly by all concerned. A deviation will be viewed very seriously, which may be kindly noted.”Currently, there are around 29 dedicate hospitals, including government and private hospitals, in the city to deal with Covid-19 patients. Further, BMC has arranged around 34,700 beds across the city for CCC and DHCH. A ward official wishing not to be named said, “When any asymptomatic patient is admitted in hospital, there are high chances of the virus becoming more active in his body. Whereas, the ones with symptoms may develop further complications if they have to wait for medical attention. Hence, it is advisable to bifurcate and admit patients following the guidelines.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-chief-only-admit-those-who-show-symptoms-to-hospitals/story-GVhq05kM5zbk7yDGvvdhUO.html
04-05-2020||Chandigarh||Closed vends in Punjab leave bacchus lovers flustered||Punjab was among the first states to ask the Centre to allow it to open liquor vends in view of fund crunch, but no liquor vend was open on day one of the lockdown 3.0 on Monday. The liquor vends will not open in the state before Thursday. Chief minister’s chief principal secretary Suresh Kumar said liquor contractors have sought three days to open vends. “Since there was curfew in the state since March 23, new contracts have been signed today. They are doing closing for the previous financial year, taking new stocks and will be ready by Wednesday,” he said. Chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh had last month written to Union home minister Amit Shah to seeking opening of liquor vends, stating that his government would lose state excise of more than ₹500 crore a month during lockdown.Bacchus lovers were a dejected lot as they made rounds of the vends in anticipation. “When liquor vends can open in Chandigarh, why not in Punjab,” said a Mohali resident. Bathinda assistant excise and taxation commissioner R K Malhotra said that since the liquor vends will be opened for the first time in new financial year so there will stock verification to allow new allottees to open the vends. Even in district like Bathinda where traders have got renew their licence and will continue to run the business, stocks will have to be checked before opening the vends.Deputy excise and taxation commissioner, Faridkot, Tejbir Singh Sidhu, said there was no communication from higher ups for opening of the liquor vends.A liquor trader said the business was badly hit because a large number of migrant workers, the main consumers of the country-made liquor, have left the state.Amritsar assistant excise and taxation commissioner (AETC) Sukhchain Singh said they didn’t receive instructions from the government for opening of liquor shops. “A meeting of state cabinet committee on the subject is scheduled for Thursday. Once we get the orders from the state government, the shops will be allowed to open.”(With inputs from Bathinda, Amritsar)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/closed-vends-in-punjab-leave-bacchus-lovers-flustered/story-lSzVdezc044Jy8WmWOILMP.html
04-05-2020||Mumbai||Mulund sees 42% spike in single day; Dharavi records 42 new cases||The Mulund area or T ward of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), which had one of the lowest numbers of Covid-19 cases on Monday, saw a 42% hike, with 52 cases in a single day. The tally of positive cases in Mulund is now 123. Dharavi, one of the biggest slums in Asia, saw 42 new cases on Monday taking the total count to 632.T ward was among the top three wards including R North (Dahisar-Borivali) and C ward (Kalbadevi-Chira Bazaar) that had the lowest number of cases in the last one month. This one-day spike in the T Ward has created a worrisome situation for the civic administration.Of the 52 infected, a majority of the cases were found in Amarnagar, Indiranagar, and Ramgad slum area. Kishor Gandhi, assistant municipal commissioner of T ward, said, “Of these, 45 cases were detected through fever clinic camps and most of them were from densely populated slum pockets.”To detect more cases, the civic body has decided to hold more fever clinic camps in dense slum pockets. The Ramgad and Indira Nagar slums reported their first case on April 19 and April 21, respectively, and then had a breather of a few days with no new cases.The BMC has identified 33 containment zones, with three red zones. It has released 10 containment zones as there were no new cases reported there for the last 14 days. As a precautionary measure, the civic health department has traced 530 high-risk contacts and kept them at a quarantine centre.Dharavi, on Monday, reported 42 new Covid-19 cases, a majority of which were reported from Muslim Nagar, Janata Society, Suroday Society, and Shiv Shakti Nagar. “While screening residents in Dharavi, we have been detecting more and more infected patients. We have targeted the high- and low-risk contacts of Covid-19 patients and the new cases have been reported from these localities only,” said Kiran Dighavkar, assistant commissioner of G North ward, which comprises Dharavi. The number of coronavirus cases in Dadar and Mahim increased by four and three respectively, taking the tally to 54 and 71.On Monday, former deputy mayor Hemangi Worlikar tested positive for Covid-19. She has been admitted to a hospital and swab samples of her high-risk contacts were sent for testing.In the G South ward, one of the worst-hit areas in the city, the doubling rate has increased to 15 days from the 10 days recorded last week. On Monday, mayor Kishori Pednekar conducted a review meeting with officials from the civic health department and expressed satisfaction over efforts taken to control the situation in Worli. There are 1,927 total active containment zones in the city at present, of which 641 are red zones (congested, need police help), 502 are orange zones (congested but manageable), and 784 are blue zones (manageable and gated communities).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mulund-sees-42-spike-in-single-day/story-N3N56B9TzZ4mRTObS9huvO.html
04-05-2020||City||Two factories gutted in two separate fire incidents in Ambala||Two factories were gutted in two separate fire incidents at Shahazadpur and Saha blocks in Ambala on Sunday night, said police.In the first incident, the fire broke out in a fabric factory located at the Saha block of the district. The Saha block police station in-charge, Chander Bhan, said around six fire tenders were pressed into service to successfully douse flames in the factory at 6am on Monday. “No loss of life or injury was reported here, but the cause of the fire has been established,” he said, adding that the incident took place due to short-circuiting in the factory power unit.In the second incident, a chemical factory in Jatwar village of Shahazadpur area caught fire amid rainfall and thunderstorm. The factory, which comes under the limits of the Panjokhara police station and is spread across one acre, caught fire around 10pm on Sunday. Police station in-charge Harbhajan Singh said that more than five fire tenders reached the spot to douse the fire and the operations ended late night.“The cause of the fire is yet to be ascertained,” he said, adding that some of the locals claimed bad weather and lightening to be the reason behind the incident. Singh said that the police are investigating the case along with the fire NOC and added that no loss of life or injury in the incident was reported as the factory was closed amid the lockdown.Meanwhile, some locals claimed that the factory was functional and producing sanitizers amid the lockdown. On this, area sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Aditi said that officials were sent at the spot late night to verify the claim, but found nothing related to production of sanitizers. As per the initial findings, the claims made by the locals were found to be false, said the SDM.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/two-factories-gutted-in-two-separate-fire-incidents-in-ambala/story-IgkNUYjNWHAkC8CTw2XiWP.html
04-05-2020||Gurugram||Corporates exercise caution, continue with work from home||Even with lockdown restrictions being eased from Monday, corporates in the city said they will continue to ask employees to work from home for at least a few more weeks, while they finalise strategies to enforce social distancing in the coming months.Spokespersons of several IT companies, start-ups and private offices said on Monday that given the rise in the number of cases in the district over the past week, they will not be reopening offices on Monday. The absence of public transport, and the sealing of the borders at Delhi are the main driving factors behind their decision, in addition to the safety of the employees.As seen with industries in Gurugram, corporate life will take longer to assume normalcy while adjusting to the various constraints of a post-COVID-19 world, many said.Sudhir Kamath, the founder of 9Stacks, a Gurugram based online gaming company, said, “The situation is nowhere near improvement. We will call our employees to work only after finalising some guidelines, which we are working on. The plan is to ensure that only 30% of the staff comes to office at a time.”Similarly, Manas Fuloria, CEO of the IT firm Nagarro, said that they would not be calling people to work unless it is absolutely necessary. “As per the ministry of home affairs’ instructions, we can function with up to 75% capacity after May 11, and permissions are not needed from district administration, but we believe it’s not imperative to have that many of our staff to come in. We will take a call on it closer to the end of the month.”Fuloria, Kamath and others weighed in on the uncertainty of the situation, pointing out that the opening up offices will increase employees’ risk of contracting Covid-19. As such, most companies have already prepared, or are in the process of preparing action plans to make workspaces safer for employees.E-commerce player Snapdeal, for example, has redesigned various aspects of its Gurugram office to facilitate social distancing. Certain desks, for example, have been marked not for use. Shared spaces such as bathrooms and the cafeteria will allow only a few people at a time, while a daily schedule has been designed for sanitising shared spaces, such as entry points, lobbies, pantries, and printing rooms.“Snapdeal’s office at Gurugram will be shut till May 17 and any reopening decision after that will be subject to continuous assessment of the situation, including government advisories, movement restrictions at interstate borders within the National Capital Region(NCR) and availability of transport facilities,” a company spokesperson said.Many corporates are keen to open up offices by early June, though at reduced capacities, like Gurugram-based software company HostBooks, which is currently functioning at 60% strength, having asked certain departments to be on leave without pay.“We are not planning to open our office as of now. We will wait until the end of the month. Even with social distancing, there are chances of staff contracting the disease. As such, we don’t want to take that risk,” said Kapil Rana, chairman and founder, HostBooks.Others said they would wait for clearer guidelines to come from the Centre. “Although the government has allowed us to resume with limited staff, we are waiting for clearer orders after the first few days and will see how it goes before reopening,” said Karann Talwar, managing director, Kitchen Kraft Luxury Catering in Gurugram.MOBILITY STILL A MAJOR CONSTRAINTTransport services remained sparse on Monday, with buses and metro services remaining shut. “A lot of the workforce comes from Delhi. That’s one big issue on which we have no clarity,” said Pankaj Bhatt, who runs a corporate training firm in the city with several employees living outside Gurugram.Private cabs will be resuming operations within the city though and in other orange and green zones. Ola, for example, said on Monday it will start services in over 100 cities, including Gurugram. Wearing masks will be compulsory, and more than two passengers per car will not be permitted.However, Bhatt and other employers said that unless cheaper, and mass transit services like buses, Metro, and sharing autos are allowed, “the workforce won’t be able to commute.”Yogesh Sharma, president of the Haryana Auto Chalak Sangathan, said, “The Centre’s order states that in green and orange zones, auto-rickshaw can ply with just one passenger. But many auto drivers have returned home. Others are unwilling to ply because the demand is little. A few auto drivers affiliated with Ola and Uber have started plying on Monday. It’s hard to say when the auto-rickshaws will start again.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/corporates-exercise-caution-continue-with-work-from-home/story-l1STYPRVruqLPiAGEbWioI.html
04-05-2020||Gurugram||40-year-old woman dies; husband, in-laws booked||The police on Sunday booked eight people, including the husband and in-laws of a 40-year-old woman, after she died allegedly in mysterious circumstances and her last rites were conducted without the knowledge of her family members in old Faridabad. According to the police, relatives of the woman alleged that the suspects would harass her for dowry and murdered her on Sunday.The police said that the woman was identified as Sobhana Sharma of New Delhi. She was married in 2004 and had a 15-year-old daughter and 13-year-old son. The husband lives with his family in old Faridabad and is a businessman.In the police complaint, Sandeep Sharma, the Sobhana’s brother, said, “As soon as she got married, her in-laws and husband began harassing her for dowry daily. They would throw her out of the house. I had tried to sort out the issue several times in the past.” He added that on Sunday, the suspects allegedly conducted Sobhana’s last rites and did not inform him about her demise.“Another sister of mine informed me about Sobhana’s death. My family and I immediately went to old Faridabad, where Sobhana’s husband told me that she had died of a heart attack and they had already conducted her last rites,” Sharma stated in the FIR. He alleged that the suspects murdered Sobhana and conducted her last rites on the quiet to cover it up.Sharma said, “On Sunday morning, my sister’s son saw her body on the floor. She was tied up and wrapped in a bedsheet. When the in-laws saw him in the room, they panicked and locked him in another room. None of the neighbours had heard about my sister’s death. I am sure they killed her.”Adarshdeep Singh, the assistant commissioner of police (ACP), old Faridabad, said, “The autopsy of the body did not take place. Sobhana’s relatives alleged that they were informed about her death after the last rites were done. We are investigating the case. The suspects are yet to be arrested.”A case was registered under sections 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence), 302 (murder), 34 (common intention) and 498A (husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) at old Faridabad police station on Sunday, the police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/40-year-old-woman-dies-husband-in-laws-booked/story-fdYw9hZPz77RteCmtpVXAL.html
04-05-2020||Gurugram||Nearly 100 migrant workers gather at Sun City after rumours of interstate travel abound||Confusion prevailed after at least 100 migrant workers gathered at the gate of the Sun City residential colony in Sector 54, a containment zone, allegedly after hearing rumours of receiving passes for returning to their respective states on Monday morning, the police said.According to the police, the crowd was dispersed after being told that the information regarding arrangements for their return was incorrect as the area was currently a containment zone. The police said that the migrants, who are construction workers, alleged that they were struggling to sustain themselves and wanted to return to their respective hometowns as soon as possible.The police said the incident took place around 7.30am when a crowd began assembling at the gate of the township, which is barricaded.Deepak Kumar, station house officer (SHO), Sector 53 police station, said, “About 100 migrant workers, who have been staying at several construction sites, gathered at the gate after they heard rumours that the lockdown was being lifted and the authorities were arranging passes for them to go to their home states. In addition to the police deployed at the gate, a team rushed to the spot and explained to them that the area was a containment zone. They were peacefully dispersed.” On Sunday, hundreds of migrant workers had gathered at government school in village Khoh, Manesar, after hearing rumours that the administration officials were registering those who wanted to leave for their respective states.Prashant Sharma, vice president, Sun City residents’ welfare association (RWA), said, “At least 450 labourers are staying at several construction sites in the township. A day before they received false information about being sent to their respective states in buses and they stared crowding at the gate. But no violence took place and they were soon dispersed after the police and locals explained the situation to them,” Sharma said.Workers of Dwarka Expressway project protestMeanwhile, on Monday, a large number of labourers, part of the Dwarka Expressway project in the city, allegedly protested at Garhi Harsaru against its contractor, demanding that they be allowed to go back to their hometowns. The labourers alleged that they had not been paid salaries for April and were struggling to make ends meet.Shafaq, a labourer, said, “We are concerned about our safety as no one is following social distancing guidelines here. The administration should provide free bus services, so we can return to our homes. We are yet to be paid our wages for last month.”A National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) contractor said that they had provided food to over 1,500 labourers till April 28.RK Mishra, project director, L&T, said, “What the labourers are saying is completely false. We had made arrangement for 5,000 face masks, hand gloves and soap and provided them to the labourers. Since the lockdown began in March, we have provided them with food, lodging and medical facilities. The company will also be paying them April’s salary despite no work taking place at that time.” There are around 1,500 labourers who are part of constructing two packages—package 3 (Haryana border to Basai railway overbridge) and package 4 (Basai railway overbridge to CPR/SPR/NH-8 junction). With construction sites being allowed to resume work with 50% of the workforce, the NHAI contractor had resumed work on April 25. A little over a week since the construction activity at the Dwarka Expressway began, work has come to a grinding halt.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/nearly-100-migrant-workers-gather-at-sun-city-after-rumours-of-interstate-travel-abound/story-VKJAn7b6NlBK6gofEBryvM.html

In their absence, testing at GMCH dipped 85% and samples are piling up rapidly.“After the attendant tested positive, we stopped taking more samples. Now, more than 1,000 samples have piled up, among which are samples of 250 Hazur Sahib pilgrims,” said Dr KD Singh, GMCH microbiologist, who is in home quarantine.Meanwhile, the GMC authorities have assigned temporary medical staff at the lab to continue the testing.Dr Lavina Oberoi, the head of microbiology department at GMC Amritsar, said, “6 temporary staffers are testing samples but since we don’t have researchers and microbiologists, the work has been hampered. From testing 500 samples a day, we are testing only 75 now. Once the staff is trained in a day or two, we will pick up pace.”Civil surgeon, Dr Jugal Kishore said that they were trying to get private labs to start testing, and 129 samples have been sent to them, whose reports will come after 3 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/covid-testing-takes-a-hit-in-amritsar-as-20-lab-staffers-home-quarantined/story-3glylCm134WODCjOdM6deN.html

04-05-2020||Lucknow||Lockdown-hit mango to see hike in export, courtesy UP govt||Another addition to the list of lockdown-hit is the mango yield this year. However, this has failed to defeat the spirit of mango farmers, backed by state government agencies like the mandi parishad.This year, the parishad has decided to increase mango export by 16%. Uttar Pradesh produces 65% of the world’s mangoes but exports less than Pakistan (which produces just 5% of global production) because Pakistan has a better export support system in place.The state produces 45 lakh metric tonnes of mango per year in its 15 mango belts spread across 13 districts, while the mango belt of Malihabad produces around 7 lakh metric tonnes of mangoes per year, out of which, only 840 metric tonnes are exported, while the rest is consumed locally.Mandi Parishad director JP Singh said, “Last year, we exported 84,000 quintals (840 metric tonnes) of mangoes to USA and Europe. This year, we have set a target of exporting 10,000 quintals of mangoes to Europe and the Gulf countries. This would benefit our mango farmers, who have been affected due to the lockdown.”“We are working to better supply chains. If flights are not allowed, then we have plans to export mangoes via the sea route,” he added.Besides, the state government is thinking about allowing packaging companies to operate 24X7 and operating Mango Mandis for longer, while maintaining social-distancing norms.Mandi Parishad and the state government are working on getting special permissions for the transport of mangoes to the other states.Singh said, “During the entire lockdown the mandis across the state have worked round the clock and ensured the crop produced by farmers reaches mandis on time. Not only that but we are trying to procure wheat from the doorstep of farmers.”UP Maha Mango Association president SC Shukla said, “Yes, the lockdown and bad weather have adversely affected the mango yield but we can cover this up by better planning and cooperation of state government with farmers. The transport of mangoes by central organisations like NAFED in collaboration with the state mandi departments, like they do in Kashmir for transportation of Kashmiri apples throughout India could be experimented here too. To this end, a delegation of mango farmers and I met chief minister Yogi Adityanath. During the meeting, the CM directed that a meeting be held with officials from NAFED, Mandi Department and mango farmers. I hope that the government takes immediate action.”Vipin Kumar, a mango farmer of Malihabad said, “The lockdown had an adverse impact on the supply chain and sales of fruits. It has been speculated that mangoes from south India like the Baiganpalli and Alfosno have seen their sales fall by almost 70%. We don’t want this to occur in Malihabad, as the first lot will hit the market by May 18. If international sale is not possible this year, then mango farmers should be given access to markets in other states.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/lockdown-hit-mango-to-see-hike-in-export-courtesy-up-govt/story-zF3Ok9QifcXgEbjSwuTPnL.html
04-05-2020||City||Quack dispensing medicine for respiratory illnesses busted||New Delhi: A clinic was sealed and an FIR was registered against a quack dispensing medicines for respiratory disease in Central Delhi’s Budh Nagar area on Monday. The person had claimed that the medicines were being dispensed on prescription of a doctor – the “prescriptions” were found to be just blank pieces of paper and the doctor prescribing the allopathic medicines had a Unani degree as per the visiting card given by the person in the clinic.“The scary thing is that the person was also dispensing the medicine ‘Deriphyllin’ which is given to people with respiratory illnesses like asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Such medicine being dispensed indiscriminately would mean that symptoms such as breathlessness in Covid-19 patients might get suppressed and the authorities might not be able to trace them. Such persons can continue infecting others,” said Dr Girish Tyagi, president, Delhi Medical Association.A case has been registered under the Epidemic Diseases Act and the Disaster Management Act, both of which have been invoked to manage the spread of Covid-19. This is along with the provision under the Delhi Medical Council Act, which is applicable otherwise.The maximum punishment under the three laws will be simple imprisonment up to three years and/ or a fine of R 20,000 under the DMC Act or any act that might cause loss or endangerment of a life can be punishable by imprisonment extending up to two years under the Disaster Management Act.“There are around 30,000 quacks across the city who are playing with the lives of the people, especially during the lockdown when many hospitals and clinics had curtailed their services,” said Dr Tyagi.The incident came to light three days ago when a team of district officials went to the areas for routine surveillance activities.“We saw around 25 to 30 people standing close to each other outside a clinic in Budh Nagar area, so we went in to ask the person in-charge to ensure that proper social distancing is followed. However, inside there was a person about 25 years of age who was dispensing the medicines. He did not have any qualification, neither could he present proper prescription from a doctor. The visiting card he provided of the doctor mention that he was a BUMS doctor. This in itself is wrong because allopathic medicines were being dispensed. However, there was no registration number of the doctor with respective council provided to us either,” said Dr Nitin Shakya, nodal officer of surveillance in the area.The sub-divisional magistrate of Delhi Cantt area Piyush Rohankar has decided to search the area for other such clinics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/quack-dispensing-medicine-for-respiratory-illnesses-busted/story-xXWmgZpC9N6Y9z7fbWnT0K.html
04-05-2020||Gurugram||Sector 9A residents write to administration; raise concern about Covid-19 hospital in vicinity||The residents’ welfare association (RWA) of Sector 9A has written to the district administration on Monday, requesting it to shift the Covid-19 treatment facility at the ESI Hospital, located in its vicinity, to a different place.The letter from the RWA stated that the hospital does not have an inbuilt sewage treatment plant and it has been using the sector’s sewer network to dispose of its daily discharge. The letter cited that sewage and drinking water pipelines of the sector are faulty and meet at different places. This is also a cause for concern for the residents.“The ESI Hospital does not have a sewage treatment plant (STP) of its own and it is connected to the sector’s sewer network. Therefore, if the sewage/medical waste is discharged from Covid-19 patients it can lead to a major health hazard in the area, as the sector’s sewer lines and drinking water lines are faulty and get mixed up at various places,” stated the letter.The residents had written to the administration before the hospital was declared as a stand-alone facility for the treatment of Covid-19 patients in early April.“Despite our repeated requests and appeals through letters, mails and WhatsApp messages to deputy commissioner (DC) Amit Khatri and chief medical officer (CMO) Dr JS Punia, this hospital was declared as a stand-alone facility for Covid-19 patients. Currently, there are more than 30 active Covid-19 positive cases admitted to the hospital. The city has seen a spike in Covid-19 cases in the past couple of days or weeks ringing alarming bells of community spread. We have appealed to the DC to shift these patients to some other hospital at a distant location,” said Lalit Bhola, general secretary of RWA.The city has as many as 84 Covid-19 cases, of which 49 patients have been discharged.Deputy commissioner Amit Khatri said, “Disinfectant and sanitisation are being carried out by the health department and other precautions are being taken at ESI.” Dr JS Punia, CMO, said, “In absence of an STP at the ESI Hospital, we have made alternate arrangements for septic tanks and use of disinfectants and bleaching.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/sector-9a-residents-write-to-administration-raise-concern-about-covid-19-hospital-in-vicinity/story-RquGddSMeCwH7PvVWN0qYK.html
04-05-2020||Gurugram||Huda shopkeepers make hay as others await RWA nod, suffer from staff crunch||The city gave a mixed response to the resumption of non-essential economic activity on Monday as some standalone shops, Huda markets, salons etc opened to roaring business under police vigil. While some chose to keep their operations suspended because of proximity of hot spots, others were forced to keep their shutters down because of labour issues caused by Covid lockdown-fuelled migration and sealing of Delhi-Gurugram borders. However, many standalone shops in residential areas said they did not know about the order since the district administration issued it late at night, and they have to take permission from RWAs.Of all the shops that opened on Monday, those selling stationary, electrical appliances, grooming salons, dry cleaners, to name some, were most visited in Huda markets of Sectors 15, 31, and 56. “People from nearby areas visited the market in large numbers on Monday and did a lot of shopping. Electrical goods, stationery items and other item of daily need were in high demand,” said Sumit Bhatnagar, a member of the Sector 56 Huda market association. For many residents, this was also the first time they could buy air-conditioners (AC) and coolers. “My family had moved into a new house in December last year. We did not feel the need to buy an AC at the time and thought we will purchase it before the summer starts. Unfortunately, the lockdown came at a time when the temperatures had just started rising. On Monday, when I came to know that an electric appliance store had opened in Sector 56, I purchased two ACs,” DLF 5 resident Vardaan Agarwal said.At the Sector 31 HUDA market, residents could be seen picking up food deliveries or placing orders for takeaways, as restaurants continue to stay shut. At the Sector 15 HUDA market, such was the rush at a sweet store that had remained semi-operational since March 25, their staff said that they sold more items in a single day than the entire 40-day period.“Today there was a huge surge in orders and takeaways. We had more than 200 customers today,” said a staff member of Sham Sweets in Sector 15 HUDA market.POLICE CAUTIOUSPolice commissioner Muhammad Akil said that they have deployed a team of about 20 police personnel and a health worker in each market to ensure shopkeepers to follow the necessary safety guidelines.“We have deployed police officials across markets in the city to ensure people follow physical distancing norms and wear masks all the time. We want to ensure people do not start misusing the safety measures and use the convenience of shops being open cautiously,” he said.Akil added that they have given 100 face masks to each police team so they can give it to those found moving without masks. “Hand sanitisers and gloves are also been kept in all police vehicles,” the top cop said, adding that each team is also carrying a thermal scanner to check suspected persons. The administration’s order on Sunday night said that standalone shops, Huda markets, shops in residential areas, salon and parlours can resume operations between 7am-7pm. The order further stated that shops in malls and high-footfall areas such as Sadar Bazar, and Galleria Market will continue to remain closed as a precautionary measure.SELF-IMPOSED CAUTIONHowever, all non-essential shops remained closed in areas near hot spots, such as the Sector 14 HUDA market, after the local RWA, which is also the supervisor of the market decided against implementing the administration’s relaxation. “We decided against opening any new shops in the market on Monday as we learnt that cases of Covid-19 have increased in Rajeev Nagar and Dundahera, which are close by. We, hence, requested the shopkeepers to cooperate with us and to keep the shops closed for another 14 days to ensure safety of all,” HS Nanda, President of Sector 14 RWA, said.However, in some areas like Vyapar Kendra in Sushant Lok 1, shop keepers and association did not know about the order. “We only came to know about the administration’s order Monday afternoon from news reports. The shopkeepers are desperate to restart business. We will start operations from Tuesday,” said Tej Singh, president of Vyapar Kendra association in Sushant Lok 1. STAFF WOESInformation aside, many business owners were hit by lack of available workers, with most of their staff either residing in Delhi or having returned to their native places amidst the coronavirus pandemic and nationwide lockdown. “Due to the restrictions at the Delhi border, the administration’s permission to open hair salons was of no use. Most of my staff members live in Delhi,” said Ashok Kumar, owner of a parlour and saloon in Qutab Plaza said.“Almost all my staff has returned to Bihar. I only opened the store today for two hours to clean it,” said Aditya Yadav, a resident of Kanahi village who sells car accessories and services automobiles in Sector 43. STANDALONE SHOPS AWAIT RWA NODOwners of a few standalone shops located in residential areas, meanwhile, said that they were waiting for the local RWAs to grant them entry and hence could not resume operations on Monday.“My shop is located inside a condominium in Sector 50. Even though I wanted to start operations, the RWA told me to wait until further directions. After much deliberation on Monday evening they told me I can resume operations from Tuesday,” said Rishav Rai, a resident of Sector 51.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/huda-shopkeepers-make-hay-as-others-await-rwa-nod-suffer-from-staff-crunch/story-ZUnNVgYS4xv6l1sjmjASPM.html
04-05-2020||Gurugram||Repairmen, IT staff, bank employees turned back at inter-state borders||Over 1,000 visitors to Gurugram, expecting relaxation of curbs to gain passage to the city in view of the Lockdown 3.0, returned disappointed as police personnel restricted their entry, especially on the expressway and MG Road.Borders connecting the two cities were sealed last week and entry of only those engaged in essential services, carrying valid passes, are allowed.As many as 1,045 people were turned away from borders between 7am and 6pm on Monday, the police said.The Gurugram police said on Sunday that intra-district movement was allowed, but there would no movement between the national Capital and Gurugram, due to the rising number of cases linked to Delhi.On Monday morning, the police had changed the layout of deployment at the Sirhaul border, by placing barricades 100 metres before the border to ensure there is no traffic congestion at the border that could hold up passage of essential supply vehicles and ambulances.A large contingent of bank employees, saloon and parlour staff, private company staff and electrical support staff were stuck at the border and had to return after to pass through.Karan Goel, the assistant commissioner of police (DLF), said that people had assumed that they will be allowed to cross the border as they had received emails from their employers to resume work, but they were not supported with any passes. “People were requesting to be allowed as they have not received salaries for the last two months and if they did not report, would not be paid,” he said.Goel said it is challenging work to check more than 2,000 passes every day and to allow people with emergency issues. Many times, people don’t understand the rules and regulations and start pleading us to allow them, despite saying no,” he said.With 85 Covid-19 cases, Gurugram is in the Union government’s orange zone list. Its 11 borders with Delhi, which is a red zone, were sealed last week.Over 50 police personnel were deployed at the most-used border points — Sirhaul, Aya Nagar and Kapashera — which generally witness a large inflow of people from Delhi and other NCR towns who work in corporate houses and industrial areas in the city’s hubs.Within the city, however, barricades were removed early Monday morning, said police. Over 103 police posts, which were set up in residential areas, were lifted after the district administration issued fresh orders on Sunday, announcing relaxation for residents between 7am and 7pm.Muhammad Akil, police commissioner, Gurugram, said that the lockdown curfew during the day (between 7 am and 7 pm) will be relaxed, but movements are restricted at night. “We have to control the movement between the two cities as the cases linked to Delhi are testing positive. Even on Monday, seven of the 11 cases that tested positive were linked to Azadpur Mandi in Delhi,” he said.Police said the passes to the employees shall be granted on a weekly basis, with fixed validity from May 4 to May 10 and from May 11 to May 17, the officials said. The applicants will also have to provide details of their ancillary units to seek support from the state in reinstating their supply chains, the order stated.The police will be deployed in residential areas between 7pm and 7am starting Monday night and anyone found violating the norms will be booked under sections 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the Indian Penal Code.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/repairmen-it-staff-bank-employees-turned-back-at-inter-state-borders/story-f7V3dhZjInHhKuAorRyXBN.html

04-05-2020||City||Stylists in PPE kit, service by appointment: Parlours, salons open amid Covid-19 pandemic||Parlours and salons in the city resumed services with limited staff across the city on Monday as the third phase of the nationwide lockdown kicked in with considerable relaxations. Hair stylists and beauticians working at such establishments welcomed customers in PPE (personal protective equipment) suits as taking statutory precautions to safeguard staff and customers remained a key concern amid the Covid-19 pandemic.“Before we opened our doors to the customers, the salon was thoroughly sanitized and disinfected. At the end of the day, we will also fumigate the premises. We had only four staff members working today who were provided PPE kits from a medical distributor. The kit included cap, goggles, mask, coat and gloves,” said Sandeep Kalra, co-owner of salon chain Grace & Glamour. The company has 11 branches in Gurugram, but started its operations only in outlets at sectors 15 and 31.Kalra said that for customers, temperature screening and noting down of personal details were mandated. The salon also did away with magazines and newspapers and it allowed customers to step inside only on an appointment basis. “We wanted to make sure that there was no waiting. Customers came, received their service and left immediately,” said Kalra. Gurugram deputy commissioner Amit Khatri in an order dated May 3 had said that salons and beauty parlours could operate from Monday, but big markets like shopping malls, Galleria market and Sadar Bazaar would continue to remain closed. Owing to reduced staff strength, walk-ins are being avoided by most establishments to prevent crowding. BloBar Ibis Gurgaon, a hair salon located on Golf Course Road, advertised resuming services soon after government guidelines on easing the lockdown was announced. It mentioned operating strictly on appointment basis to limit the number of customers present at its salon. “We were fully booked for Monday. We had only three staff for the day. Transportation was provided to them as we did not want them to take public transport. They were also provided PPE kits. At the salon, only three customers were allowed in at a time,” said Sargam Chopra, owner and founder of BloBar. Chopra said that the salon had also provided the option of customers bringing in their own towels as it stopped outsourcing its laundry and was doing in-house laundry. “Some customers got their own towels, as it makes them feel safe,” she said.Besides, all efforts are being made by these establishments to reduce skin contact between clients and staff, keeping safety measures in mind. This is leading to a change in procedure of services like threading and hair cutting. “For threading, we earlier didn’t wear a mask. But now we will loop the thread around the neck, sanitize the thread and then do it. This way, the end of the thread is not held in the mouth, so it is safe. For colouring and cutting, we were already wearing masks. Previously, some facials were done wearing gloves but now it will be done for all,” said Bharti Taneja, founder and director of Alps Beauty Group. As the salons and parlours opened after more than 40 days, some of the sought after services were haircuts, trimmings, colour touch-ups and threading. Several parlours and salons in the city had closed down operations mid-March even before the lockdown began, citing low footfall. “There was some business after Holi, but then the coronavirus scare took hold and people stopped coming to parlours. We stopped services around March 20,” said Kalra. A guideline issued by the Beauty & Wellness Sector Skill Council directs all salon professionals to closely ensure sanitisation and disinfection of work stations, hydraulic chairs, tools, equipment and trolleys. It also suggested immediate removal of cut hair on the floor as well as from combs, brushes, rollers, and scissors by rinsing in lukewarm shampoo water. “Avoid threading, and recommend peel off wax to the clientele • Use disposable spatula to apply the peel off wax • Apply talcum powder with a piece of cotton on the forehead/upper lips for threading • Use disposable spatula for the wax application, and disposable strips for waxing,” read the directives titled Health & Hygiene Guidelines for the Beauty & Wellness Industry, Post Covid-19 Pandemic.Individual cosmetic brands have also shared circulars with franchise owners on maintaining safety standards. A pre-opening guidelines issued by L’Oreal suggests using alternate salon chairs to maintain social distancing along with other measures like sterilisation of equipment.Most establishments in the city are looking at segregated openings of their outlets as they focus on figuring out a hygiene and sanitation protocol. Taneja of Alps Beauty Group, who runs around 30 outlets in Delhi-NCR, said that the Gururgam outlet of her beauty clinic will resume operations from Tuesday.Several such establishments located in shopping complexes and malls in the city, however, remained closed for services. Beauty chain owners are also refraining from opening shutters in areas like Galleria market.“We are awaiting further government guideline as our salon is in Galleria Market,” said Neeraj Jain, franchise owner of Revlon salon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/stylists-in-ppe-kit-service-by-appointment-parlours-salons-open-amid-covid-19-pandemic/story-79nn1GuCGpJhWWyXmqqXyK.html
04-05-2020||City||Strike by staff of OOAT clinics leaves patients stranded in Ludhiana||The strike by employees of the de-addiction and rehabilitation centres and out patient opioid assisted treatment (OOAT) clinics left scores of addicts and their relatives stranded on Monday.A long queue was witnessed outside the OOAT clinic here after the agitating staff, demanding regularisation, refused to attend the patients. Failing to get their daily dose of medicine, many patients of the rehabilitation centre were seen anxiously waiting for their turn to get the medicine.On the other hand, employees held a protest at their centres, wearing black ribbons and holding placards.Rajan from Shimlapuri was waiting for the protest to end outside a centre. He said he had been visiting the centre since Friday, but returned empty-handed everyday.“Today, I came around 6am, but till afternoon, I could not get the medicine. I have been taking the medicine for the past one-and-a-half years. When my turn comes, I will demand extra dose to avoid frequent visits,” said Rajan.Manjit Kaur, 55, was waiting for her turn while sitting on a rickshaw. She said her bed-ridden husband had been under treatment for nearly a year. “I am here to take medicine for him. I have been sitting under the scorching sun since morning. I have not eaten anything. I hope the strike will be over soon, so that I can take the medicine and return home,” said Manjit Kaur.Raman of Basti Jodhewal said, “The police had blocked the road and put up nakas across the city. I somehow managed to reach here, but only to find the staff raising slogans.”State president of the OOAT centre staff union Parminder Singh said they have been serving the state sincerely, but the state government paid no heed to their demands of regularisation. Besides, being deployed at OOAT clinics, they were also made to perform duty at Covid-19 wards as well.“We are working for a outsourcing company and have no medical insurance. Still, we are ready to help the government during the time of crisis, but the government does not think about us.”“As many as 60,000 patients have already got admission to the OAAT clinics and drug de-addiction centre during the lockdown, which has put a heavy burden on the employees. We are ready to help the government, but it should also think about us,” said Parminder Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/strike-by-staff-of-ooat-clinics-leaves-patients-stranded-in-ludhiana/story-kExwPb4pXBlUPvdBZbiOTO.html
04-05-2020||Gurugram||Hero MotoCorp to resume production from Wednesday||City-based two-wheeler manufacturer Hero MotoCorp, on Monday, said that the company will start its operations in a graded manner from Wednesday at its plants and corporate offices, following the relaxations put in place by the government amid the nationwide lockdown to check the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The company has the necessary permissions from the local authorities to start production, said its spokesperson.The spokesperson of the company said that operations will commence in a phased manner at its manufacturing plants located in Gurugram and Dharuhera (both in Haryana), Haridwar (Uttarakhand) and its global parts centre (GPC) at Neemrana in Rajasthan.

04-05-2020||Gurugram||11 test positive in highest single day spike, Khandsa Mandi shut till May 8||Eleven more cases of the Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) were confirmed—the highest spike in one day—on Monday, the day economic activity resumed in the district after 40 days. Majority among those who tested positive are vegetable sellers and wholesale dealers at Khandsa Mandi, which has been shut till May 8. On Monday night, the Haryana State Agriculture and Marketing Board issued an order stating no activity will take place in the mandi till Friday. Health officials said the area will be sanitised and more samples will be taken from those who came in contact with the positive persons at the mandi. They, however, said it would be difficult to trace those people who bought vegetables from the primary contacts.Out of the 11 new positive cases, nine were vegetable sellers and wholesale dealers at Khandsa Mandi. Of these, seven had contact with people in Delhi’s Azadpur Mandi and two had contacts with people in Nasik and West Bengal. Other cases are from Sector 80 and Sector 12, including the daughter-in-law of the man who committed suicide on April 29. With this, Gurugram’s tally of persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus touched 84 and the district, an orange zone, now has more cases of Covid-19 than any other affected districts in Haryana; Faridabad has 75 cases, Sonepat 73 and Jhajjar 56. State health officials, however, said the numbers are increasing due to increased targeted sampling and testing in Gurugram compared to other districts. TARGETTED SAMPLINGLast week, the district health department conducted contact tracing of over 1,656 people at the Khandsa Mandi and took 128 samples. Sampling was done after cases surfaced in Jhajjar and Sonepat with links to Azadpur Mandi—Asia’s largest wholesale market of fruits and vegetables in Delhi which has reported 17 Covid-19 cases till now. Over 1,277 samples have been collected from Jhajjar Mandi, 315 from Fatehabad Mandi and 470 from Rohtak, among other district mandis. “We are aggressively doing targeted sampling in the district by covering people in vegetable mandis, media professionals, health care workers, police personnel and others in government departments. We have intensified the testing in Gurugram compared to other Haryana districts. Gurugram accounts for 18% of the total testing done in the state,” additional chief secretary (health) Rajeev Arora said. As a part of targeted sampling, the health team has done RT-PCR tests of over 310 people suspected of having contracted Covid-19 in Gurugram. Across the state, 6,825 people have been tested, of which 54 vegetable sellers, 12 health workers, 4 media persons and 5 policemen tested positive for the coronavirus disease. “In Gurugram, first there were cases with travel history, then it was Tablighi Jamaat attendees and now cases are increasing as we are doing targeted sampling of different groups who have high exposure to now locally positive cases or contaminated areas. Therefore, with targeted sampling asymptomatic cases are coming up. This would help us in breaking the chain of transmission and containing the infection,” Arora said. CONTAINMENT ZONEThe district administration, on Monday, increased the number of containment zones from 11 to 13 in Gurugram block. To tackle the situation, the health department has set aside 100-bed ESIC hospital, 300-bed SGT Medical College, 500-bed Medeor hospital in Manesar and 20-bed Park Hospital for Covid-19 cases. “We have enough beds for Covid-19 cases. Sixteen private hospitals are also empanelled to provide treatment,” chief medical officer Dr Jaswant Singh Punia said. According to him, till now, 6,766 samples have been tested in Gurugram, out of which 6,259 tested negative, while results are awaited of 423. Of the 84 positive cases, 49 have been discharged while 35 are undergoing treatment at ESIC Hospital and SGT Medical College. Though the Central government has allowed home isolation, Punia said they are not allowing it in the district with a fear that it would cause infection to spread. CLASSIFICATIONDespite being an orange zone, where cases are less than red zones such as Faridabad and Sonepat, the rise in numbers has set the alarm bells ringing for the state and district officials. The concern is also due to the relaxation given in the orange zone under Lockdown 3.0. A senior official in the state government, privy to the matter said, “Surveillance, testing rate and doubling rate of cases has been the criteria set by the Central government to designate a district red, orange or green zone. We have directed health teams and deputy commissioners to do aggressive contact tracing to identify symptomatic and asymptomatic cases. However, our concern is also to restart the industries.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/11-test-positive-in-highest-single-day-spike-khandsa-mandi-shut-till-may-8/story-NOnTkqy1DljptT64iAm7CP.html
04-05-2020||Chandigarh||Sukhbir censures Digvijay, CM for demonising Sikh pilgrims||Shiromani Akali Dal president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Monday criticised Congress leader Digvijay Singh for holding Sikh pilgrims guilty of spreading coronavirus disease in Punjab.He has also demanded a high-level probe into the state government’s “mysterious refusal” to follow its own norms in handling the pilgrims’ after their arrival.“Digvijay’s statement will defame Sikhs all over the world as the originators of coronavirus infection. Instead of shedding fake tears in PR videos over pilgrims’ sufferings, Capt Amarinder Singh should apologise to Sikhs as shocking statements by several Punjab ministers and Congress leaders like Digvijay were tarnishing the community’s image,” Badal remarked.The SAD chief said it would be insane to link the Sikh pilgrims of Nanded Sahib with the spreading of coronavirus in Punjab.Sukhbir’s reaction came in the wake of a tweeted reference by Digvijay linking the Sikh pilgrims with the spread of Covid-19 in the state.Defending his party’s efforts to bring back the pilgrims, he said his party and the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) have repeatedly declared that they would take full responsibility of looking after the pilgrims and every other Punjabi in their hour of need, including provision of facilities for comfortable quarantine.“But instead of accepting our request, the Capt government has been torturing and humiliating the pilgrims and others who have been quarantined in filthy environs,” he said.He also expressed “grave concern over the reports of a conspiracy to infect the incoming Naded Sahib pilgrims with the virus on the journey or on arrival” as they had been repeatedly tested negative before their departure.He fired a volley of questions at the CM on the government’s “mysterious refusal” to follow its own norms while handling the pilgrims upon their arrival.SAD has demanded a high-level, independent inquiry, preferably by a sitting judge of the Punjab and Haryana high court, into the whole episode. “The issue stinks of something shady and mysterious,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sukhbir-censures-digvijay-cm-for-demonising-sikh-pilgrims/story-zN9xxtb1boUYXh2sBBvSGK.html
04-05-2020||Gurugram||Residents’ associations in a fix over allowing domestic helps, walks||The district administration on Monday night allowed residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) to put in place guidelines for domestic workers such as maids, drivers, dhobis, tailors, car cleaners and others coming in from outside, as per their own needs. The administration also added that workers, including maids, from containment zones were prohibited from coming in.In a late-night order on Monday, the administration also shared details pertaining to the movement of people in and out of the condominium. RWAs have been asked to ensure that entry for non-essential visitors (family, non-family, trainers) is limited. Residents with health conditions and those who need to walk their pets are allowed to move about within the condominium complex. For pets, only a 15-minute walk is allowed. RWAs said that they were holding consultations with all stakeholders and decisions were subject to review in light of the government order.Before the orders were issued, the first day of the third phase of the lockdown was fraught with intense discussions among RWAs and residents, with the entry of domestic help and timings for walks becoming major points of contention. Many residents said that apartment complexes and RWAs were creating and enforcing their own rules. RWAs, meanwhile, said that the rules were fairly open-ended and ambiguous, due to which arriving at a decision was tricky. At several places, such as DLF Phase 2 and World Spa in Sector 30, residents have been allowed to call in domestic help. At Fresco Apartments, Princeton Estate, restrictions on the entry of domestic help continue, while residents are allowed to move about. At Emaar Palm Drive, restrictions were overturned by evening after residents raised objections to the one on domestic help. Residents are also allowed to take walks within the condominium during fixed timings.Entry of Domestic HelpThe RWA of DLF phase 2 has allowed domestic help to come in and advised them to wear masks. “We have asked residents to ensure that domestic workers maintain hygiene and are given sanitiser bottles. They have been asked to not gather in groups,” Wahi said. He added that construction work within the locality had started as well. “Construction material has started coming in and work has also started in full swing,” he said. The central shopping arcade, however, continues to remain closed.At Fresco Apartments in Nirvana Country, restrictions continue on the entry of domestic staff. The condominium has not shared any revised guidelines and is sticking to the advisories shared earlier. “We received the order from the administration late at night and will be issuing new guidelines in response by tomorrow. Till the time that’s done, the status quo will be maintained,” Nilesh Tandon, president, Fresco RWA, sai.Tandon, however, said that the RWA was not stopping residents from moving about. “We can’t stop people from moving around since we don’t have the authority. We are not a law enforcement agency. Even if people are walking, action has to be taken by the police, not us,” Tandon said.Residents of the condominium, meanwhile, said that the entry of domestic help could be initiated with proper screening. Aparnaa Laxmi Singh, a resident of Park Place in Sector 30, said that intense discussions were taking place among residents over the entry of domestic help. “Senior citizens are very much affected due to the restrictions on domestic help. Even others are under strain and in favour of maids being allowed. However, as of now, the restrictions on domestic help continue,” Laxmi said.Another resident of a condominium in Sector 66, who did not wish to be named, said that RWAs were exercising arbitrary power. “Many people are in favour of bringing in domestic help, but the RWA is not allowing that except in the case of senior citizens. The RWA is not incorporating our suggestions, be it on the entry of domestic help or fixing timings for walks. There were around 500 messages exchanged on the Whatsapp group but to no avail,” the resident said.Aarogya Setu screeningSeveral condominiums across the city are making Aarogya Setu screening mandatory for outsiders coming in. World Spa in Sector 30 has made it mandatory for outsiders, including domestic help, to download the app.Ashwani Singla, president of The World Spa Apartment Owners’ Association, said that the condominium had been following an extensive screening process for the past few weeks, which was being carried forward to mitigate any risks. “We have been conducting mandatory Aarogya Setu screening for all our domestic staff and delivery persons for a while now. We have extended that to our maids now,” Singla said. While everyone was supposed to comply with the screening process, exceptions were being made for residents who had reservations about downloading the app due to privacy concerns.At Wellington Estate in DLF-5, technicians and service providers will only be permitted inside if they have the Aarogya Setu app installed. As per the latest advisory, residents are also required to install the app. Vineet Bagga, RWA member, Wellington Estate, however, said that the app was not compulsory for residents. “The rule regarding Aarogya Setu app only applies to people who might come in for servicing and other jobs. Residents are not bound to install the app,” Bagga said.Walking within the complexCondominiums have given different timings to residents for walking within the complexes. Residents have been asked to abide by physical distancing protocols. The guidelines vary across condominiums.

04-05-2020||City||Gurugram: Tipplers queue up outside liquor shops, return empty-handed||Gurugram: Like other cities of the national capital region where many people lined up in front of wine shops to buy liquor bottles on Monday morning, Gurugram also witnessed long queues outside liquor vends well ahead of their opening across the city. However, tipplers in Gurugram had to return from the shops empty-handed as the liquor stores remained shut throughout the day. However, officials of the excise department said there are chances that the liquor shops in Gurugram will be allowed to open within this week.People queued up outside liquor shops in different parts of the district, including Sector 15, Sector 56, Badshahpur area and Sohna Road, since the early hours of Monday, but found the outlets remained closed. Police teams patrolling in these areas had to ask them to go back home. Some people were seen waiting in their luxury cars outside the closed stores in the morning to grab their stock.The confusion was apparently due to the orders in neighbouring states and the national capital where liquor shops were opened on Monday.In Gurugram, many people were eagerly waiting to buy liquor as they reached outside the shops before 7am. Gaurav Gupta, a resident of Sector 50, said that he reached the liquor shop at 6.45am so that he could collect his stock before anything went wrong. “I thought the state government announced that all shops, including liquor vends, would be allowed to open. There was no clarity on it,” he said.Another resident, Atul Sharma of Sohna Road, said he had returned in the morning as he was told the shops would open at 2pm, but despite waiting for an hour there was no progress. “The government had not announced the temporary shutdown of liquor shops and suddenly took the decision. At least it should have given some time to people to stock up. This has increased the black marketing of liquor in the city,” he claimed.The owner of a liquor shop in the Golf Course Road area said they have not received circular from the excise department to open shops. “Our shops have already been sealed by the department. So, unless the department asks us to start the operations, we cannot open the outlets,” he said.H C Dahiya, deputy excise and taxation commissioner (west), said that the department has not received any orders yet from the state to reopen the liquor vends in the district. “We are likely to receive orders in a day or two and there are chances that the liquor shops will be open within this week. But fresh guidelines will be issued to ensure the shop owners maintain social distancing to ensure the safety of people from the deadly virus,” he said||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-tipplers-queue-up-outside-liquor-shops-return-empty-handed/story-Pj9RkEpdzlZwjn2sYiGagP.html
04-05-2020||Noida||A tiger in Pilibhit dies after being rescued, had multiple injuries||A male tiger in its prime that wooed the social media with its photograph on a tractor during a rescue attempt in Pilibhit died on Sunday evening after being shot with two tranquilising darts, officials said.Post-tranquilisation, multiple wounds were found on its body, including a maggot-infested one on the neck. The body of the dead animal was sent to the Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI), Bareilly, for a post-mortem examination. The report is awaited. According to officials, the tiger was spotted near a human settlement under the Mala forest range for the past few days. It was only after it attacked three locals that pressure from villagers mounted on forest officials to rescue the tiger. Officials said that on the morning of May 1, the tiger had attacked three villagers. Later, it went back to the forest, not far from the settlement. However, it returned on May 3, after which the department decided to carry out the rescue operation, seeing the rising anger among the locals.“The locals were getting agitated and we had to act fast. We shot a full dose of tranquiliser and attempted to get closer. However, it did not doze off. In fact, a moment later, the tranquilised tiger even attempted to charge. We had to give it another dose of lesser intensity. We took the animal to the guest house for further treatment after it showed complications. However, an hour later, it died,” said H Rajamohan, field director, Pilibhit tiger reserve, Uttar Pradesh.Rajamohan said that three veterinarians, including the supporting staff of the Wildlife Trust of India (WTI), helped with the operation, after oral permission from the chief wildlife warden to tranquilise the tiger was taken.Being asked as to why the veterinarians from the animal husbandry department and not the forest department were used, officials said that the team involved was competent enough.“The team involved was competent. The idea was to rescue it, treat it, and release it back into the wild. The doctors involved had been in other missions earlier as well,” said Lalit Verma, chief conservator of forests, Rohilkhand zone. He added that the department often outsources vets in such cases.“It was a majestic and a big tiger. I had never seen such a large tiger before,” he added.According to Dr Sunil Rathaur, the vet who tranquilised the tiger, there were some deep wounds on the tiger, including one that suggests that the tiger must have been earlier attacked by a long sharp spade-like weapon.“The dose of tranquiliser was well monitored to ensure that there is no possibility of an overdose. We had been monitoring the animal for a while and it seemed sluggish. Later, we found that there were four wounds on it right side, including one on its neck, shoulder and chest. The chest wound was deep. The animal also had a fractured rib and deep wounds. It appears as if it was attacked,” said Rathaur, the chief vet of animal husbandry department, Pilibhit.Asked as to how far the forest area was from where the tiger was being spotted, he added that the region was a part of a wildlife corridor. “There are no fringe forests in Pilibhit. There are proper dense forests and agricultural fields,” he added.This was the second tiger that was attempted to be rescued in the reserve this year. Last month, another tiger was rescued after it attacked a few humans near the forest area. The tiger was later sent to Kanpur Zoo. Speculations for its release into the wild are on, the field director said.With cases of man-animal conflicts being often reported from Pilibhit, this is the second tiger death in the reserve this year. In May 2019, in a shocking incident, a mob of angry villagers ventured two kilometres inside the forest and lynched a tigress to death.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/a-tiger-in-pilibhit-dies-after-being-rescued-had-multiple-injuries/story-LhpZHD8xHZyDNrTDvGILmO.html
04-05-2020||Noida||Units in Noida special economic zone to begin operations||The Gautam Budh Nagar district administration, from Monday, has started inviting online applications from the entrepreneurs of Noida Special Economic Zone (NSEZ) and export-oriented units (EOUs), to permit them to restart commercial activities. Development Commissioner (NSEZ) LB Singhal said that the fresh start of commercial activities in SEZs, following the ‘jaan bhi, jahan bhi’ mantra given by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, will open numerous doors for economic growth in the post-Covid-19 phase. “The NSEZ has over 262 export units. In 2019-20 fiscal, exports from SEZs crossed ₹7,80,000 crore. I believe that post-Covid-19, SEZs will offer huge opportunities to international investors as many companies specifically from USA and Japan will be looking to invest in India. SEZs have 20,000 hectares of developed land with ready infrastructure for such investments. Single window clearance in SEZs will also attract overseas investors,” he said.Singhal further said that the details of the circulars of Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) and state government, besides the details of the online application process for the requisite permission, are being circulated among all the SEZ units. “They have been asked to follow the social distancing norms strictly at their respective units. For units employing more than 50 people, it is mandatory to reduce the workforce by 50%. However, the shifts and working hours can be negotiated between the employers and employees,” he said. Ajay Goel, the president of the NSEZ entrepreneurs’ association, said that they have been asked to apply online in non-containment zones. “Our applications will be forwarded by the respective SDMs to the authorities concerned. After that, the Noida authority, the Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority (GNIDA), the Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA), THE development commissioner (NSEZ), THE regional manager, Uttar Pradesh Industrial Development Authority (UPSIDA) and the ADM (land acquisition) will issue final permissions in their respective areas,” he said.He further said that the new system is very user-friendly and consumes minimum time. “With this permission, not only will the economic activity start in a controlled manner, but it will also be proved a test case for further opening of economic activities after the lockdown. The exodus of migrant workers will be reduced as they will see that there is a scope to return to work. Under this new system, the authorities can get the exact data of units and their employees in a single click,” he said.The district administration had earlier refused to allow the entrepreneurs of the NSEZ to operate despite notifications from the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on April 15 and Uttar Pradesh government on April 16 stating that the area is part of a containment zone.The district administration has identified 36 containment zones in Noida and placed them in two categories — 20 have one case each (A) and the remaining 16 have two or more cases each (B). “While for A zones, areas within 400m will be sealed, for B zones, a 1km perimeter will be contained. Earlier, there was a one-kilometre radius around areas with one case each and a three-kilometre radius around areas with more than one case,” district magistrate Suhas LY said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/units-in-noida-special-economic-zone-to-begin-operations/story-vH3tSgW5Y3KOPP3Qh3FECJ.html
04-05-2020||Delhi||Employees left to make own transport arrangements as offices resume||As offices resumed work with partial staff from Monday, with the Delhi government also holding a cabinet meeting, many employees were left to make their own arrange transport arrangements in the absence of public transport.As per the Delhi government’s orders, all private offices can operate with 33% staff strength physically present on the premises and the rest working from home. Similarly, all Delhi government officials, of deputy secretary rank and higher, can function with 100% staff, while 33% of staff strength is allowed for other ranks.The Delhi Secretariat sprang to life on Monday as officers reported to work, even though the number of hours they clocked in office was lower than usual. Sub-registrar offices, which deal with the registration of properties and other related works, also opened after more than a month. “The online application window was resumed today (Monday) as well. So, we saw fewer people physically coming to the office because they have to take appointments. We are maintaining adequate social distancing norms in the office,” said an official at the sub-registrar office in south Delhi’s Hauz Khaz.Thermal screening of employees and visitors was carried out in all government buildings on Monday. The number of people in lifts has also been restricted, from two to four, depending on the lift size.. While senior government officials used their official cars, the Delhi government arranged for cars to pick up and drop employees. However, a few were left to their own devices, such as the staff working at the secretariat canteen.“Since the Metro is shut, my husband dropped me and he will pick me up. We have not been given any pick-up and drop facility yet,” a chef at the canteen said. In the private sector, while larger companies arranged office cabs for employees, others had to make carpools with colleagues.“I usually take the Metro to the office but today (Monday), I had to ask my colleague to pick me up on his way. Office cabs are being provided only to those working early morning and night shifts,” said Vedant Tripathy, a management consultant working in south Delhi’s Nehru Place.However, some were caught at the inter-state borders, unable to crossover to their offices. A lack of clarity over inter-city commute for work led to many being stuck at the Delhi-Noida borders on Monday morning.“We were told that only those who are living and working in Noida are allowed to resume work. The police stopped us, saying that people living in Delhi and working in Noida cannot be allowed. We have been asked to report by our employers but we are stuck here, unable to reach,” said Murlidhar Yadav, at the Delhi-Noida border on Monday morning.Barring initial hiccups, private companies had made arrangements to screen employees at entrances and ensuring social distancing.Be Safe, a security agency headquartered in Jhandewalan, resumed its call centre services on Monday with 15 employees. The temperature of each employee was checked at the entrance and workstations were arranged to allow six feet distance among one another.“We made sure that none of the staff coming in today had any symptoms of flu. We have also given each of our employees a bottle of hand sanitizer so that they can keep their hands clean,” said Sumegha Kirti, spokesperson of the firm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/employees-left-to-make-own-transport-arrangements-as-offices-resume/story-jVL4fT9i9rMcGjx7tJae0K.html

While 13,500 hospital beds have been identified for the symptomatic cases in the tertiary and peripheral hospitals, 80,000 beds have been identified for asymptomatic cases, in schools, marriage halls, hostels, hotels, sports complexes.An official from BMC said, “The projection of 75,000 cases by May-end is the worst-case scenario. BMC is preparing for these many cases as a contingency. We do not want to take any risk, and would rather have our preparedness be under-utilised. For example, each of our beds needs oxygen points. The facilities which can remain long term, such as getting oxygen points with an inbuilt pipeline in hospitals. However, we are setting up temporary beds at hotels and schools are being given oxygen cylinders.” Hospital beds for symptomatic patients are being readied at dedicated Covid hospitals in the city, including 5,000 beds at private hospitals. In addition to this, 750 beds in intensive care units are also being made available. BMC has identified 25,000 isolation beds at hotels, hostels, marriage halls, and sports complexes. Besides, another 35,000 beds have been identified in 350 municipal schools, and 20,000 beds can be available in ‘jumbo facilities’ such as gymkhanas. A senior civic official said, “Asymptomatic patients are being moved to institutional quarantine facilities called Covid Care Centres (CCCs). Those who have separate rooms, individual toilets, and have scope for quarantining at home without interacting with the rest of their family members are asked to do so.”On April 24, Hindustan Times had reported that BMC projected the number of cases in Mumbai to increase to 70,000 by mid-may or May end, based on the calculation of the doubling rate at that time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/worst-case-scenario-bmc-prepares-for-75k-cases-by-may-end-12k-symptomatic-and-63k-asymptomatic/story-sERzO2ucObN2UTXZk9IjSL.html
04-05-2020||Noida||Liquor shops open in the city; people queue up maintaining social distance||Unlike Delhi, where liquor shops had to be forced shut after huge crowds gathered and created a ruckus, Noida on Monday saw patient long queues as people wearing face masks came to buy liquor. The presence of police personnel was witnessed at most of the liquor vends, including those in Barola, Bhangel, and Sector 27, among others. Police officials were seen enforcing social distancing measures, asking shop workers to draw circles on the road and ensure that everyone had their face masks on. According to the excise department, a total of 391 vends were allowed to open on Monday in Gautam Buddh Nagar district out of a total of 481 registered shops. The liquor shops were shut down on March 22, two days before the nationwide lockdown was announced.“The number of shops that are allowed to operate will fluctuate depending on the changes in the number of containment zones. So far, a total of 391 out of 481 liquor shops were allowed to be opened on the first day. This number may increase or decrease depending on the situation. Our teams were on the ground, ensuring a smooth sale of the liquor with basic protocols of social distancing and face masks in place,” said RB Singh, district excise officer, GB Nagar.He added that since many shops are quickly running out of old stock, the excise department is working on the availability of fresh stock of booze of required brands from the godowns. Supply will be ensured within the next two or three days.While Noida witnessed no incidents of a ruckus at any liquor shop, those located near the Noida-Ghaziabad border, however, witnessed excessive long queues as the liquor shops in Ghaziabad remained shut.“There were excessive long queues at the shops near the Noida-Ghaziabad border, but people were disciplined and no incidents of ruckus were reported,” Singh added.According to the district magistrate’s order, the shops will remain open from 10am to 7pm. The order has also directed the liquor stores to ensure that sanitisers are available and the staffers wear face masks. Meanwhile, a number of liquor shops also ensured that every customer either has his face covered or is wearing the mask.“Almost every shop is crowded because the stores have opened after a long time. Had there been no police presence, the situation would have gone out of control, like the reports from Delhi. We also ensured that every customer had his face covered. The only issue is that due to limited stock available, we could not cater to the demands of every customer. However, we are told that fresh stock will be made available soon,” said Ashok Yadav, who owns a liquor store at Sector Omega-1, Greater Noida.Meanwhile, the police officials said that they are on high alert and monitoring the situation to ensure that proper distancing is maintained at all the shops. “We are on alert and, so far, no problem has come to light. All liquor shop owners have been instructed to strictly implement social distancing measures while operating,” said Kumar Ranvijay Singh, additional deputy commissioner of Police, Zone 1.The lockdown continued to be in force in most of the parts of the city, with shops other than those selling necessary items being shut and only a few people out on the streets.A few shops other than those selling necessary items,such as electronics and mobile, general merchants, clothes etc, were reportedly open in some of the villages of the district, such as Shahdara, Dadri etc“There were a few shops, such as motor and automobile repair workshops, that were open in the villages. But there were only a few people on the streets, mostly to buy liquor,” said Sachin Kumar Pandey, a security guard who lives in Shahdara village in Sector 141.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/liquor-shops-open-in-the-city-people-queue-up-maintaining-social-distance/story-JQXQVBQnjEnBvbH6Vt7NLM.html
04-05-2020||Chandigarh||Veggie markets in Haryana are new hotbeds of contagion||Vegetable markets in Haryana are emerging as the new hotbeds of Covid-19 infection in the state.Health authorities have attributed the recent surge in cases emanating from the vegetable markets in Jhajjar, Bahadurgarh and Sonepat to intensive real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing of people involved in vegetable trading.As per the statistics, 54 out of 131 persons (about 41%) who tested positive for Covid-19 in the last four days have vegetable trading connection. Out of 54 positive cases, 43 were from Jhajjar, nine from Sonepat and two from Faridabad. About 60% of the 29 positive cases detected in Sonepat on Monday also have vegetable market links.Additional health chief secretary (ACS) Rajeev Arora said the higher number of positive cases was on account of coverage of large number of groups, including a sizeable chunk of vegetable vendors.“An easier option would be not to go for rigorous sampling as a large part of the infected population is anyway asymptomatic. But we have made a tough choice. Intensive testing of over 3,500 vegetable traders and workers, over 1,300 frontline health workers, over 800 cops, 300 journalists across 22 districts is the reason why the number of positive cases has shot up in the state,” the ACS said.Arora said they have tested over 2,400 in Jhajjar district alone, including 1,277 in Bahadurgarh mandi. “Similarly, we have tested about 470 in Rohtak, 315 in Fatehabad, 299 in Kurukshetra and 128 in Hisar in less than a week,’’ he said.Professor Dhruva Chaudhary, the nodal officer for Covid-19 at Rohtak PGIMS, said most of the vegetable traders and workers seem to have contracted the infection from Delhi’s Azadpur Mandi, a bustling wholesale vegetable-fruit trading spot. “The suspects would include commission agents, wholesalers, retailers, workers, their primary contacts and families,” Prof Chaudhary said.Jhajjar civil surgeon Dr Randeep Singh Poonia, who pushed the sampling in the last few days, said he will also be writing to the civil surgeons in other districts to sound them about the risks involved in vegetable supply operations. “Wherever the vegetable supplies from Azadpur are reaching here, there is contagion through both humans and the raw stock,” Dr Poonia said.OTHERS UNDER INTENSIVE TESTINGThe ACS said that among other high-risk suspects subjected to RT-PCR testing were delivery boys, milk vendors, personnel in the office of deputy commissioners, transport officials, chemists, roadways employees, food handlers, volunteers, milk vendors and sanitation workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/veggie-markets-in-haryana-are-new-hotbeds-of-contagion/story-Jng8H6zQwVestF8C4XQcUK.html
04-05-2020||City||Cycle industry pedalling out of lockdown, big manufacturers to begin production in Ludhiana||Rusting at a time of nationwide crisis, the local cycle industry, which manufactures over 1 crore bicycles per year and has a major share in exports, is slowly pedalling out of the lockdown with the major players, including Hero Cycles, Avon Cycles, Neelam Cycles among others opening their plants with permission of the government on Monday to start production. The industry is currently working on stocktaking, reprogramming and lubrication of the machinery, which was put to a halt on March 22, and production is expected to start in a day or two. At present, the industry will not run to its full capacity due to the constraints of non-availability of material, social distancing of workers, etc. But, moving out of the unprecedented lockdown, which, as per industry representatives, was not witnessed even during Indo-Pak wars, emergency period and Operation Bluestar in 1984, industrialists are confident that the industry would come out of the crisis soon and plants would run regularly.“We have to learn to live with the virus and we will live with it. We will deal with the problems with a positive mindset and the industry will surely move out of this crisis,” said Onkar Singh Pahwa, chairman of Avon Cycles, adding that production at the unit would commence in a day and everything would come to normal in the coming days.Managing director of Hero Cycles SK Rai said the Hero Cycles plant was established in 1956 and since then they had never seen this kind of nationwide lockdown, not even during the Indo-Pak wars and emergency period.Both the plants situated along the GT Road and the Mangli area are being made operational and the plants would be working to full capacity by the end of this week, said Rai, adding that the industry was following all the guidelines issued by the government and the administration. With the lockdown entering into the third phase, the industry also sees no other option than to open the factories even when the supply chain has not been restored and the small and medium industry is facing shortage of manpower. “The industry has to take a step forward as we cannot sit idle for long and labour is also dependent on the industry. We will still run the plant at 25% capacity as we will also face trouble in storing the manufactured itemsl,” said KK Seth, chairman of Neelam Cycles.He said the supply cannot be made to the traders as shops are closed and even if the shops open, there is no customer. They are commencing production in a day or two but cannot comment on the future at present viewing the present scenario, said Seth, adding that the small and medium industry would also go the large industry was in a few days and open the units. President of the United Cycle and Parts Manufacturers Association (UCPMA) DS Chawla said, “Owners of small and medium industrial units are getting approval to run their units, but they are facing a shortage of labour. The government should make efforts to stop the migrant labour from shifting to their home states and the labourers should be provided facilities in Punjab.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cycle-industry-pedalling-out-of-lockdown-big-manufacturers-to-begin-production-in-ludhiana/story-OLaaEhifmbPN8reMoDB5wN.html

The boy allegedly killed himself after being scolded by his mother over borrowing money, the police said.No note was recovered from the spot and the body was sent for an autopsy. The police said they were informed about the incident around 2pm.“A team was rushed to the spot and the body was brought down, after which it was sent for an autopsy. When we spoke to the family members, it seems that the boy had been scolded by the mother in the morning over borrowing some money. They were not in a condition to provide any more details,” said Dharmendra Kumar Sharma, station house officer, Sector 49 police station.He said that in the afternoon, the parents, who work as daily wagers, were seated outside the house while the incident took place. The boy’s mother found him hanging when she entered the house during lunchtime, the police said.The police are also probing other reasons that could have let the boy take the step. The body will be handed over to the family following the autopsy. Police officials said that the family, of migrants from West Bengal, has not filed a complaint.Gautam Budh Nagar does not have a dedicated helpline to deal with such situations.

04-05-2020||Noida||Lockdown 3.0: Stringent measures continue at Noida-Delhi border, officials on alert||Stringent restrictions continued to be in place at the Delhi-Gautam Budh Nagar (GBN) border on Monday, the day lockdown 3.0 began in India with area-specific relaxations.GBN district magistrate (DM) Suhas Lalinakere Yathiraj tweeted the dos and don’ts of interstate travel on Sunday. While the Union home ministry issued federal guidelines on Friday, states and local authorities can frame rules specific to them based on ground reality.“Restriction on interstate movement/interdistrict movement stands as before. No interstate/inter-district movement of personnel allowed for permitted activities also (except for previously allowed purpose like Covid-19 duty, emergency services, etc.) [sic],” Yathiraj tweeted.The order effectively means that interstate and interdistrict movement for activities permitted under the new guidelines would not apply to Noida, which is part of the Gautam Budh Nagar district, and that stringent border curbs will continue to remain in place in Delhi’s satellite city.However, health workers on Covid-19 duty, media personnel with authorisation letters and policemen, among a few others, are exempt.Complying with Yathiraj’s instructions, law enforcement officials kept a strict vigil at the Delhi border on Monday morning. Those carrying valid passes were allowed to enter and exit the district via the interstate border after thorough verification.“Most people who are aware of the regulations are not coming to the border. But there are a few exceptions. All restrictions on the movement at the interstate border with Delhi are in place as they were earlier,” Rajesh S, deputy commissioner of police (traffic), GBN district, said.Kaladhar Narayan, a resident of Noida Sector 107 and an employee at a Delhi-based public sector understanding (PSU) enterprise, has been travelling to work despite the lockdown restrictions. “I have obtained the requisite letter from my office, along with the pass. I do not face any hassle while travelling to work as I have the necessary permission,” Narayan said.On Monday morning, as certain relaxations, including the nod to private vehicles with a maximum of two passengers besides the driver, kicked in even in red zones such as Delhi and Noida, there was a momentary lapse at the border.“But we coordinated with Delhi authorities quickly and all the restrictions for border movement are in place now,” Sankalp Sharma, DCP, zone 1, GBN district, said.“...We’re discouraging any unnecessary cross-border movement,” he added.Several police personnel were deployed at the Kalindi Kunj Road and they strictly checked commuters entering Noida. Several commuters were also asked to return to Delhi since they had no valid pass. Jyoti Raman Singh, a security guard, lives in Madanpur Khadar in Delhi and works in a Noida shopping mall. “The mall is closed but the security guards need to be present for the mall’s safety. My employer had issued a letter a few days ago for my movement. But the police are not allowing me into Noida,” he said.The Union government first imposed a 21-day lockdown on March 25 and then extended it for 19 days till May 3. On Friday, the government announced another two-week extension, but this time with zone-specific curbs and relaxations, though there are some activities banned throughout the country.Monday also saw liquor shops opening in the district for the first time since the beginning of the lockdown from 10 am to 7 pm. People made a beeline for these shops and kept the police on their toes.“We are on alert and so far no problems have come to light. All liquor shop owners have been instructed to strictly implement social distancing.

04-05-2020||City||Ghaziabad: Two dead, one ill after ‘drinking liquor’, bodies cremated without autopsy; kin deny rumours of sanitiser consumption||Ghaziabad: Two persons died while one was rushed to a hospital in Meerut after “consuming liquor” at Bakharwa village in Modinagar town of Ghaziabad. The bodies of the two victims were cremated without post mortem by their families, said district officials, adding that an inquiry has been ordered into the incident. Officials also said they are looking to rumours that the three consumed sanitiser.The families of the victims said that the health of the two -- Kishan Pal, 32, and Mangat Ram Sharma, 60 -- deteriorated after they allegedly consumed smuggled liquor and both died in the early hours of Monday. The third victim, Vipin Kumar, 28, was rushed to Meerut for treatment. According to the families, liquor is being sold in the village even though there is a national lockdown in place. Liquor has not been deemed an essential commodity by the central government and all liquor shops are closed in Ghaziabad as the district has been designated a red zone due to the rapid spread of the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease here.“Liquor has been available in the village for the past seven to 10 days and my brother consumed it on Sunday. Liquor is available at many places even during the lockdown,” said Sudesh Kumar, elder brother of Kishan.He said there had been rumours that the three drank some sanitiser liquid. “Some people floated a theory that the three had consumed sanitiser. This happened because some children picked up a small empty bottle of sanitizer and brought it home. We have the bottle of liquor with us from which my brother drank alcohol,” he said“Late Sunday, my brother’s health took a hit and he started to vomit. He also passed blood during the vomiting. He succumbed in the early hours of Monday. He used to consume liquor before as well but the one he consumed on Sunday led to his death. Later, it was decided by people in the village that last rites be performed. So, we performed the last rites and no post mortem could take place,” he added.The victim’s neighbour, Mangat, died after his family rushed him to a private hospital, where he was declared dead on arrival.“My father had liquor on Sunday morning and later at night he went to water our fields. There, he developed severe pain in the abdomen and I brought him home. He slept around 3-4am. After hearing cries of a death at our neighbour’s house, I tried to wake up my father but he did not wake up. I rushed him to a hospital where he was declared dead,” said Kavinder Sharma, Mangat’s son.Kavinder said that sale of liquor has been rampant in the village for the past few days.“It is sold openly and is available in the villages even during the lockdown. There is no action. My father consumed liquor even two days ago and on Sunday as well,” he added.Upon information after the last rites of the two persons were performed on Monday morning, the district magistrate and the senior superintendent of police reached the spot to make inquiries.“I have directed for an inquiry into the entire incident. Appropriate action will be taken up once the sequence of events comes to light,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate, Ghaziabad.Sources in the police, meanwhile, said they have come to know that one of the three victims had bought three bottles recently, one of which was of a chemical which is used for the preparation of sanitisers.“The wife of one of the victims told us that three bottles were purchased by her husband. It is a probability that the victims mixed some chemicals to the small quantity of liquor available with them and consumed the mixture. However, this will be ascertained through medical and forensic examination. The three containers have been recovered. Since last rites of the two have already been performed, more information will be gathered from the third victim who is still under treatment,” the officer, requesting anonymity, said.SSP Kalanidhi Naithani said the three were known to each other.“Officials reached the village after information of the last rites was relayed to us. The cause of death is not yet known but investigation is underway. A blue-colored liquid was recovered from the house of the deceased. A team from the excise department has also reached the village for making inquiries,” Naithani said.By Monday evening, the police said they lodged an FIR into the incident.“The FIR is lodged against unidentified persons under Section 304 (Culpable homicide not amounting to murder). The third patient is in ICU at a hospital in Meerut and is under treatment,” said Neeraj Kumar Jadaun, superintendent of police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-two-dead-one-ill-after-drinking-liquor-bodies-cremated-without-autopsy-kin-deny-rumours-of-sanitiser-consumption/story-Fibl34Wo8s5IhGqRNWWlDN.html

04-05-2020||City||Case against Ceasefire: Police may seek arrest warrant against firm’s MD over Covid-19 spread||Noida: The Gautam Budh Nagar police will soon be going to produce all the evidences against fire safety solutions company Ceasefire -- the super spreader of Coronavirus in the district -- and its top management in the court. Officials said that they want to get an arrest warrant before taking action against the managing director of the Sector 135-based company.The police have swung into action after all the 42 Covid-19 patients having direct or indirect links with Ceasefire in the district got discharged. The 42 persons included the company’s managing director (MD), employees, their family members and domestic helps.“We are collecting evidence against the Ceasefire company and its officials responsible for the spread of Covid-19 in the district. We will be producing all the evidences in the court first before approaching the MD. We want to get an arrest warrant before reaching out to him. He has now been discharged from the hospital and is about to complete his quarantine period,” said Sankalp Sharma, deputy commissioner of police (DCP), Zone 1.The managing director of Ceasefire had returned from the UK on March 1 and another employee had returned on March 7 from there. Then the company’s auditor from London visited its Noida office in the third week of March. All the three persons jumped their quarantine period and were attending office which led to spread of the deadly virus among other employees and then to their family members, the officials said. In the Ceasefire trail, the first positive case was reported on March 24 when the wife of an employee was found positive for Coronavirus.On March 29, the Expressway police had lodged an FIR against Ceasefire under sections 45 (punishment of offences committed within India), 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) of the Indian Penal Code. The FIR was lodged on the orders of then chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Anurag Bhargava for hiding the foreign travel history by a few employees of the firm.The police will also be recording statements of the employees who had contracted the infection at the Sector 135 office. “We are expecting that in another one week, we will be able to take action against the company officials. We will be soon approaching the court in the matter,” said the DCP.Calls and text messages to the managing director of the company elicited no response on Monday. The last patient from the Ceasefire trail was discharged on May 1 after staying in the hospital for around 36 days. The 39-year-old had developed Covid-19 pneumonia following which it took so long for him to get discharged, health officials said.The health officials had to put 1,000 people on surveillance who had direct or indirect links with the Ceasefire company during the contact tracing process. Ceasefire was the first cluster of Covid-19 infection in the district. In March, the district administration and the health department had failed to check the Covid-19 spread in its nascent stages. Thus the Ceasefire company and the cases linked to it became the root cause for the transfer of then district magistrate BN Singh and CMO Bhargava.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/case-against-ceasefire-police-may-seek-arrest-warrant-against-firm-s-md-over-covid-19-spread/story-PEb3dIk3cUt8t0PG0lONdJ.html

Officials have said that the man was from the Khoda Colony of Ghaziabad. His death will be counted in Ghaziabad’s records, informed Gautam Buddh Nagar health officials.According to the officials, the man was undergoing treatment for respiratory problems and died around 12.35am on Monday. He had first gone to another hospital in Noida from where he was referred to Felix Hospital on April 2.“A patient from Khoda village, Ghaziabad, was referred from ESI Hospital in Noida in an emergency condition at around 10pm on April 2.

04-05-2020||Lucknow||Foreign brands and beer sizzle, ‘desi’ takes a hit||Resumption of liquor sale after a six-week break in Uttar Pradesh bared the plight of the poor as Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) and beer outnumbered the sale of ‘desi’ (as country liquor is known) by a decent margin.However, excise department officials weren’t complaining. They claimed the distinction was temporary.“The larger picture is that sales worth nearly ₹200 crores were reported on day one across the state. Of course, these sales don’t mean excise revenue which is lesser but in the end the badly needed revenue has started flowing in again,” an official said.Country liquor contributes nearly 60 per cent revenue of the total revenue from liquor sale to the state’s kitty, with foreign liquor and beer contributing the rest. However, day one of the resumption of sale indicated a reverse trend.While the business and service class rushed to stock their choicest brands, the poor, who prior to the lockdown mostly preferred the ‘powwa’ or the quarter, of country liquor priced at ₹75, largely stayed out of ‘desi’ vends.“It’s true that country liquor sales were unimpressive throughout the state though IMFL and beer recorded brisk sales,” said UP Sharab Vikreta Welfare Association secretary Kanhaiya Lal Maurya, who also runs a country liquor vend.‘The labour class, our top consumer of country liquor, is missing from ‘desi’ outlets. Mostly out of work, they hardly have any money to consume as most are more caught up with a desire to make two ends meet,” said Pragalbh Lavaniya, district excise officer in Bahraich, bordering Nepal. Bahraich has about 193 country liquor shops.“Another likely reason is that unlike the rich who flouted social distancing protocols at various places, the poor were more conscious and mostly stayed indoors. Many villages have shut themselves up and that too may have affected the sales,” said Akhilesh Pratap Singh from Latifpur village adjoining the state capital. “In pre-lockdown days ‘desi’ would outperform the IMFL and beer sale in Kanpur but today the 341 country liquor outlets that are among total 811 liquor vends in the district did average business,” said Arvind Maurya, district excise officer in Kanpur.District excise officer of Lucknow Sudarshan Singh, senior excise inspector in Varanasi Vishnu Pratap Singh and excise inspector in Noida Pramod Sonkar also confirmed a similar trend.“The labour have left Noida for their villages as the construction activity has come to a standstill due to lockdown. Once construction resumes, the country liquor sale would pick up,” said Sonkar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/foreign-brands-and-beer-sizzle-desi-takes-a-hit/story-zEcq8uJb7kQlfWSqoYe7eO.html

04-05-2020||City||Ludhiana: Sudhar police accused of replacing tractor seized after accident, SSP marks inquiry||A major discrepancy came to light when a tractor, seized in an accident case by the Sudhar police, was found to have been replaced with some other tractor while it was handed over to the owner on a court order.After a local made a complaint in this regard, the senior superintendent of police (SSP, rural) has marked an inquiry in the case and deputy superintendent of police (DSP, crime) Dilbagh Singh has initiated the investigation.Apart from replacing the vehicle, the police allegedly filed a chargesheet in the case under Section 304-A (causing death due to negligence) of the IPC against the driver of the tractor attached with a combine machine, while the first information report (FIR) was registered under Section 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) of the IPC against the driver and owner of the vehicle. The police also spared the owner of the vehicle in the chargesheet produced before the court.Motorcyclist Kamaldeep Singh, 22, had died in a road mishap on October 28, 2019 after a combine machine, attached to an Agri King-20 55 tractor, hit him and crushed him. The police had lodged an FIR against driver Parminder Singh alias Pinda of Cheema village under Sections 279 (rash driving or riding on a public way), 304-A and 427(mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees) of the IPC on the statement of Pavittar Singh, uncle of the accused.After the kin of the victim staged a protest, the police had booked the owner of the vehicle Satnam Singh of Rajoana Kalan village and replaced Section 304-A with Section 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) of the IPC. The combine machine and the tractor were seized by the police.Three months ago, the owner of the vehicle received the tractor on ‘Supurdari’. The police mentioned in the documents that they have handed over tractor Swaraj 855, seized in the case, to the owner following a court order.Interestingly, the Swaraj 855 tractor was registered with the transport department on December 13, 2019, 47 days after the accident.Complainant Mandeep Singh of Rattowal village said, “The tractor seized by the police had no documents and it could not be released, but to benefit the owner of the vehicle, the police released the vehicle using papers of another tractor, which was never seized.”DSP Dilbagh Singh said he has already initiated an investigation and collecting evidence against discrepancies. He said stern action would be taken against those found guilty.A file photo of a combine machine attached with a tractor in the Sudhar police custody in Ludhiana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-sudhar-police-accused-of-replacing-tractor-seized-after-accident-ssp-marks-inquiry/story-guVZiAsdOpcFUG36CpEipJ.html
04-05-2020||Mumbai||Govandi locals allege lapses by civic body in isolating Covid-19 patients||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has identified Govandi as a growing hotspot for Covid-19 cases, similar to Dharavi. The densely populated slum pockets in M east ward (Govandi-Mankhurd) have reported a total of 410 positive cases and 50 people have died after battling the virus so far.There have also been several lapses in the civic body’s efforts to contain the virus in the area. One such case is of a 45-year-old woman who was symptomatic but was not shifted to an isolation facility for three days despite testing positive for Covid-19 on April 30. The woman could reportedly not be moved due to the unavailability of beds and was instead asked to remain at home.The 45-year-old lives in Panchsheel chawl near Lumbini Baug, a congested slum pocket in Govandi. When she was finally shifted to a hospital on May 3, her husband, who is a heart patient, also tested positive.Shrushti Salve, a resident of Panchsheel chawl, said, “Even the husband of the 45-year-old has not been shifted to an isolation facility because allegedly there are no beds available. The ward office did the same when the wife tested positive. We ensured that social distance is maintained but we have common toilets and the risk factors cannot be ignored. BJP leader and former MP from the area Kirit Somaiya tweeted on Monday, “Shivaji Nagar Govandi is at Corona Fire. 35 Citizens at Limboni Baug Camp, Two Police Constables and 12 BMC Health Staff found Corona Positive. Two civic health center closed down. One dozen Positive Patients not getting admission in Hospitals.”The M East ward, which includes slum pockets of Deonar, Govandi, Bainganwadi, Shivaji Nagar, and Cheetah Camp along with the Deonar dumping ground, has a population density of 36,923 per sqkm, more than the city’s average density of 32,303 per sqkm.Arun Kumar, CEO of the NGO Apnalaya, said, “What we need is a granular strategy which is basically a different strategy for different areas. There are only two hospitals here that are overburdened with Covid-19 cases to an extent where they had to shut the out-patient departments (OPDs). Patients are being turned away in a ward that has had a health crisis for years.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/govandi-locals-allege-lapses-by-civic-body-in-isolating-covid-19-patients/story-FteDaTSaFnm2DSjzUefDtO.html
04-05-2020||Noida||Construction resumes at a few realty projects, but with restrictions||The developers in Noida and Greater Noida on Monday said a majority of them will not be able to resume construction at their respective sites owing to riders imposed by the government amid the ongoing lockdown to prevent the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid 19).There are at least 600 ongoing realty projects in Noida, Greater Noida and Yamuna Expressway areas. The developers had to halt construction since March 25, 2020, when the government enforced the nationwide lockdown. As per the developers’ body, the National Real Estate Development Council, at least ₹50,000 crore homebuyers’ money is invested in housing projects in Noida and Greater Noida. Due to disruption in construction, the housing projects are expected to be delayed. To minimise the damage done to industries, including the realty sector, the Uttar Pradesh government has allowed construction in non-containment zones (which are not Covid-19 hot spots and are not sealed) with riders that construction labourers are made to stay on-site and standard operating procedures with regard to social distancing norms and sanitisation are adhered to. The state government also allowed the opening of private offices with a staff strength of up to 33%. “We have resumed construction at our sites in Noida, Greater Noida and Yamuna Expressway areas with limited workforce. We have also started operations at offices with reduced staff and are following laid-down protocols. We first disinfected our offices and sites before starting operations. But the real estate sector will only be able to revive if the government announces relief package, take quick decisions on our demands and give financial aid to builders -- the 45-day lockdown has left us with huge liquidity crisis,” RK Arora, president, NAREDCO (Uttar Pradesh chapter ), a builders group, said.The majority of builders are unable to resume construction as labourers want to go home.“We do not have exact numbers of builders who cannot resume work. But a majority of them do not have labourers on-site. As a result, work cannot resume. We are requesting the administration that labourers living in the vicinity of construction sites be allowed to work, while following social distancing norms,” Prashant Tiwari, president, Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (CREDAI), Western UP, another builders’ lobbying group, said.Since March 25, many construction labourers were staying at construction sites or in makeshift houses erected nearby as they were not getting transport facilities to return to their home towns.“But now they know the government is arranging transport facilities and they want to go home. It is becoming tough for us to stop them from going to their home towns.Also, liquidity crisis is affecting the construction,” Getambar Anand, former national president, CREDAI, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/construction-resumes-at-a-few-realty-projects-but-with-restrictions/story-tuZaNqUgdIRzyutzgn82mL.html

04-05-2020||Noida||Now pay fine for spitting in Noida||To check the spread of the highly infectious Coronavirus disease through careless spitting in public places, the Noida authority on Monday ordered a penalty, in the range of ₹500-₹1,000, for the violation. The move comes after the Uttar Pradesh government decided to penalise those who chew tobacco and spit in the open. The order will be remain in place till another order is issues withdrawing this one, officials said. “We have appointed officials who can fine the violators,” Noida authority chief executive officer Ritu Maheshwari said.On May 3, the state government had directed the Noida authority to ban on use of tobacco products, and impose a penalty on public spitting. All vends selling tobacco products have been shut since March 25, when the nationwide lockdown came into force to contain the spread of the Covid-19, which spreads through droplets and for which we have no vaccine, yet.The state government has decided to sternly act against spitting at public places after the health department said that spitting may lead to spread of Covid 19 among people.According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), spitting can cause the spread of Covid-19 as the saliva of an infected person can carry the virus for more than 24 hours.The authority said that for first offence, the authority will impose a fine of ₹500 and if a person is found spitting second time then the fine will be ₹1,000. For repeated offenders the authority may take tough action. The authority has authorised all officer on special duty, tehsildars, assistant project engineers, project engineers and senior managers, among other officials to conduct random inspections and penalise defaulters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/now-pay-fine-for-spitting-in-noida/story-zOVQE1KXfhYDnuF2cNSawN.html

04-05-2020||Delhi||Lack of clarity leads 70% industrial units in city to stay shut||Around 70% of all factory units across industrial areas in the city continued to remain shut in the city as confusion remained over rules regarding their opening on part of state government and city police, the Aam Aadmi Party’s trade and industry wing claimed on Monday. Following the Union home ministry’s order, the Delhi government had on Sunday decided to allow industrial estates and townships to start operations given that all such units ensure access control of its workers at the entry/exits of their respective areas. There are 28 authorised industrial areas in Delhi. Multiple senior government officers, who did not wish to be named, said that they are yet to get a list of standard operating procedures related to the opening of factories, because of which many owners were told to shut their industries on Monday. The representatives of at least 78 industrial associations also raised their concerns regarding the issue during a meeting via video conferencing with members of the Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP) trade and industry wing on Monday afternoon.Industry owners said that even as some of them opened the factories, local authorities including the sub-divisional magistrate (SDMs) and the police, in some areas got the units closed by midday saying that they did not have orders yet to allow their functioning.“The government has released an order, but it has not reached enforcement agencies on ground, including the area SDMs. Around 400 of the total 700 factory units in the area had opened today but all of them had to be closed by 2pm despite proper access control mechanisms being in place. We raised the issue during a virtual meeting with the AAP and hope it’s addressed soon,” said Ashok Gupta, president, Udyog Nagar Industrial Association. The units here deal mainly in manufacture of footwear and engineering goods.The industrial complex has 4-5 security guards at each of its gates and identity cards have been issued to the workers. “Only five (of around 20) workers have stayed behind in each factory unit. Only some cleaning work could be done today while no manufacturing could take place ,” he said.Videos of police personnel addressing factory owners in several areas surfaced on messaging platforms late on Monday afternoon.“The issue is that the government needs to send out clear guidelines — along with a list of industrial areas and types of units that are allowed to open — to the district magistrates and the police. Even owners don’t know if they are required to take prior permission before opening the units or not,” said Navdeep Malhotra, member, Mayapuri Industrial Association.According to Brijesh Goyal, convener, AAP’s trade and industry wing, only around 25%-30% factory units could open across the city, including Udyog Nagar, Okhla, Mayapuri, Narela, Bawana and Mangolpuri, among others. “This was mainly because local authorities denied permission to those without proper access control mechanism. While in some areas, there was confusion over essential and non-essential goods making units. We will submit the queries and suggestions made by industry owners during the meeting to the government for resolution at the earliest,” said Goyal.A senior Delhi government official, who did not wish to be named, said that they had not received formal orders with guidelines till Monday evening. “We are expecting the SOPs to be issued on the operational guidelines. In many areas were asked factories to shut down for not having adequate access control mechanism,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/lack-of-clarity-leads-70-industrial-units-in-city-to-stay-shut/story-3z7XfmUHCtFD0jNFcnY0kL.html
04-05-2020||Delhi||Day One of relaxed lockdown: Cops ease up on workers, shut liquor shops after large crowds gather||With people trickling out of their homes on Monday, after over a month of being under a lockdown, the Delhi Police was more lenient in its dealing with the people, especially towards plumbers, electricians, domestic helps and others who are part f essential services.Senior officers said since most workers do not carry any work ID cards, they were allowed to move about after basic questioning and verification. However, in many areas, liquor stores that opened on Monday had to be closed following large gatherings around them and rampant violations of social distancing guidelines, police said. A senior police officer said the relaxation of lockdown rules, starting Monday, has eased movement of people, especially self-employed professionals such as plumbers, domestic helps, electricians and water purifier technicians. However, one major challenge that the police faced on Monday was to profile and verify these independent professionals.“Because most of these people do not carry ID cards and work independently, we are largely profiling them on the basis of what tools they are carrying with them. In some cases, we even call the house where the plumber or electrician is going to, to verify their credentials,” the officer, requesting anonymity, said.Delhi Police spokesperson MS Randhawa said other than people who are self-employed, all others are requested to carry proper their professional identity cards for which relaxation has been granted and movement passes issued. “All violators will be booked,” he said.Randhawa also said the validity of the movement passes that the police had issued for essential services till May 3, has been extended till May 17.While Monday saw increased traffic volumes on Delhi roads, police continued their deployment at pickets.People were also seen coming out on to main roads. The police said they were continuing with regular patrolling, public announcements and surveillance using drones in crowded areas.In east Delhi areas such as Krishna Nagar, Jagatpuri, Kondli, Karkardooma, people were seen standing in groups, walking on streets, riding two-wheelers or driving without being stopped by police.In central Delhi, police said people mainly remained indoors despite the relaxation as markets such as Karol Bagh, Chawri Bazar and in Daryaganj continued to remain closed.Deputy commissioner of police (central) Sanjay Bhatia said because only a few stand alone shops were allowed to open, there wasn’t much crowd gathering. “People restricted themselves in our areas. We were conducting regular patrolling not just on main roads but also on internal roads. There was more traffic on road today and adequate staff was deployed to ensure smooth movement,” Bhatia said.However, opening of liquor shops led to violation of lockdown norms as a large number of people gathered around these outlets, not caring much about the social distancing norms, police said. “We spotted that people are not following social distancing at liquor shops. They had gathered in large numbers and therefore we had to close these shops. We are conducting an audit to streamline the process of liquor sale in our area so that safety guidelines are not violated,” Bhatia said.Even in south Delhi, the two liquor shops that had opened had to be closed because of the huge crowd that had gathered around. “Many had come without masks, they had brought bags and packets to hoard liquor bottles and no queue was being maintained. The shop owners therefore decided to shut the shops. Police provided adequate safety and support in normalising the situation,” an officer, wishing not to be named, said. As the government also allowed movement of migrant workers, pilgrims, tourists, students and others by special trains, deputy commissioner of police (railway) Herendra Kumar Singh said they’re awaiting government directions on facilitating such people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/day-one-of-relaxed-lockdown-cops-ease-up-on-workers-shut-liquor-shops-after-large-crowds-gather/story-TTaGTbrYuJ6FVqmCVkYGuO.html
04-05-2020||Delhi||48 hours, five robberies and one theft: Robbers held after they forget to switch off GPS on stolen phone||In the span of 48 hours last week, a gang of four allegedly robbed five people and stole a motorcycle, all without using a gun or a knife. They made off with anything and everything they could lay their hands on -- from ₹100 cash they found on one victim to dairy products from a milk trader.But their luck soon ran out; they forgot to turn off the GPS on a phone they had snatched from a food delivery agent in South Delhi’s Malviya Nagar. “The GPS of that phone remained on. It led us to the exact location of the suspects and we apprehended them,” Atul Kumar Thakur, deputy commissioner of police (South), said.Until the lockdown, to prevent the spread of Covid-19 was announced, these men had operated individually, police said . Three of them -- Vivek, Nagender and Raju -- already had 10 cases of robberies and thefts against each of them, had been arrested multiple times and were registered ‘bad characters (suspects with a long criminal history)’, the DCP said. The fourth member of the gang is a minor and his name has been withheld by the police. The lockdown compelled them to join hands, police said. “Their search for alcohol and drugs during the lockdown brought them together. They had no guns or knives, so they decided to work as a group to intimidate victims and rob them,” Sudhanshu Dhama, assistant commissioner of police (Sangam Vihar), said.Since they had access to just one stolen motorcycle, the four of them would ride out together posing as people in need of essential items.“They mostly food delivery agents and dairy traders because they expected them to be carrying cash. Since the vehicles of these victims are generally loaded with goods, they thought they wouldn’t be in a position to fight back,” ACP Dhama said.From the early hours of Friday to the early hours of Sunday, the gang allegedly robbed five people without meeting any resistance. The victims included three milk traders and two food delivery agents.“On one milk trader, they could find only ₹100 cash. From another, they took ₹600 cash and dairy products. From a third, they stole ₹500 cash and mobile phone. Another delivery agent was robbed of his mobile phone, his Aadhaar and PAN cards. And when they realised that one motorcycle wasn’t comfortable for them, they stole a scooter from Sangam Vihar,” another investigator said.But in the last two cases in the early hours of Sunday -- the robbery of a milk trader in Neb Sarai and a food delivery agent in Malviya Nagar -- the police saw the similarities in the modus operandi.“We contacted officials of the food delivery firm and got to know that the rider’s phone wasn’t switched off. Since the rider had left his GPS on while returning from a delivery, we tracked the movement of the suspects and got to know that they were in Sainik Farms,”Rahul Gupta, assistant commissioner of police, said. By 9am Sunday, the suspects were surrounded by the police at the gate number 1 of Sainik Farms.While the adults were immediately arrested, the juvenile managed to escape until he was apprehended a few hours later, DCP Thakur said.Most crimes have dipped in the national capital since the lockdown came into effect. Robberies and snatching, for example, have dipped by 62% and 253%, respectively, between April 1 and 15, compared to the corresponding period last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/48-hours-five-robberies-and-one-theft-robbers-held-after-they-forget-to-switch-off-gps-on-stolen-phone/story-jpRciD9gG7okndJsJrCq3N.html
04-05-2020||City||DMRC, PWD and NBCC to resume work on infra projects where manpower, material are available||New DelhiA day after the Delhi government gave the nod to resume construction activities on major public infrastructure projects in the city, government agencies have started preparations to restart work that had been suspended since March 25, when the nationwide lockdown was announced to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).Government departments such as public works department (PWD), Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), the NBCC-India Limited, among others, which are helming important infrastructure projects in the city, have started taking an inventory of construction material and availability of labourers at the sites.The PWD is working on important projects such as the construction of a 1.2km tunnel between Mathura Road and the Ring Road, Barapullah Phase-3 elevated road project, Shashtri Park and Seelampur flyovers in north-east Delhi, and the Benito Juarez Road underpass near south campus of the Delhi University, among others. The government has allowed construction only on those projects where the workforce is “available on-site”. PK Vats, PWD engineer-in-chief, said, “From Monday, we have started taking an inventory of construction material at our sites and also the availability of labourers. We have asked the persons in charge of different projects to submit a report on the present status of projects and start the work at the earliest.”A senior PWD official, who wished not to be named, said projects where financial approval has already been given and substantial work has been done on the ground are unlikely to face any hurdle in resuming construction.The official, however, said a status report would be sent to the government describing “the progress and financial health” of projects.According to PWD estimates, nearly 450 labourers are available at the tunnel construction site near Bhairon Marg, around 200 workers are living at Barapullah Phase-3 elevated corridor project site near Sarai Kale Khan and Yamuna basin near Mayur Vihar-1. Approximately 150 labourers are available at Benito Juarez Road underpass project site, while another 100 are available at Shastri Park and Seelampur flyover construction sites. “Construction work will be started at these sites in a couple of days. However, the available labour is not enough to ensure that the project moves forward at the required pace. So, initially at least, the progress is expected to be slow. We have asked the contractors to arrange more workforce so that the progress is not affected,” a senior PWD official, not wishing to be named, said.The NBCC (India) Ltd, which is in-charge of the Pragati Maidan redevelopment and other central government projects, said it will start the work with the available construction material and labour. The workforce for Pragati Maidan project is staying near the site. The project, which started in July 2017, is scheduled to be ready by the year-end.“The NBCC has around 15 on-going projects in Delhi such as IIT-Delhi, East Kidwai Nagar, Pragati Maidan IEEC, and Vanijya Bhawan, among others. With the government giving the go-ahead for construction activities in the city, we have initiated the process to resume work at those sites that have labourers available. A few sites have resumed work from today ( Monday),” PK Gupta, CMD, NBCC-India Ltd, said.According to DMRC officials, they have also started the assessment process and have enough workforce to restart construction activities. A DMRC official, on condition of anonymity, said nearly 3,500 workers are living at various construction sites in Delhi and NCR and there would be no problem in resuming work at these sites.Anuj Dayal, executive director corporate communication, DMRC, said, “The DMRC is geared up to commence construction work at its sites as per the government directions. All necessary preparatory activities such as reopening of site offices, deputation of necessary personnel, ensuring the availability of machinery and materials are being taken up.”The DMRC had started the construction work of Phase-4 at Haiderpur Badli Mor on December 31, 2019. This work is also expected to resume soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dmrc-pwd-and-nbcc-to-resume-work-on-infra-projects-where-manpower-material-are-available/story-xIhofJjjp8vaUg9SxjIrpK.html
04-05-2020||Lucknow||More batches of UP migrants arrive via four special trains||Over 3,000 migrant labourers reached Uttar Pradesh through four Shramik Special trains on Monday.The trains, which reached Gorakhpur, Lucknow and Agra districts, brought back migrants stuck in Maharashtra and Gujarat due to the coronavirus lockdown announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 24On Sunday, the first migrant special train, having 815 migrant labourers, had reached Charbagh Railway Station, Lucknow.The second migrant train, having around 1200 passengers, had reached Agra on Sunday.Officials with the Railways said, so far around six migrant special trains have reached UP, bringing in more than 5000 migrants.Once back, the migrants would be quarantined in their respective districts.A 22-coach Shramik Special train (01901) ferried 1145 workers from Maharashtra’s Bhiwandi station to Gorakhpur Junction.According to migrant workers, each passenger was issued a travel ticket at Rs 745 for the journey which began on May 2.“Railways have charged Rs 800 per passenger,” said Raj Kumar Shindey, deputy commissioner of police (DCP) Bhiwandi,(Maharashtra).He rejected the charge that some migrants could not board train as they didn’t have the money for tickets.The second special train which carried 983 labourers from Vasai Road railway station reached Gorakhpur at 5.30 am.SDM Sadar Gaurav Agarwal said the labourers had been thermal screened and transported to respective destination in already arranged buses.“But, they will have to stay in quarantine centres before reaching home,” he said.Another migrant special train from Gujarat’s Vadodara , having around 900 people onboard, reached Lucknow at around 5:30pm.The fourth train arrived in Agra from Ahmedabad.Various district administrations had made elaborate arrangements to transport the train passengers to their respective destinations. Uttar Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (UPSRTC) has pressed in more than 150 buses to transport the migrants to their respective districts.Though jobless, a sense of satisfaction was palpable on the faces of the migrants.“It’s been more than 40 days since we were stranded in Maharashtra after the lockdown was announced. But I am happy that I am home,” said Suresh Gaud, 30, who reached Gorakhpur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/more-batches-of-up-migrants-arrive-via-four-special-trains/story-JELdV9wNK27pJOcjRIHCIJ.html
04-05-2020||Chandigarh||11 ayurvedic college teachers in Patiala appointed without finance dept nod||Patiala Government Ayurvedic College, Patiala’s, appointment of 11 teachers in March 2019 is yet to get state finance department clearance, due to alleged procedural ambiguities and irregularities on the part of the authorities at the college and the Directorate of Medical Research and Education (DRME). The DRME office issued the appointment letters. The teachers have been without salary for a year. In addition to not taking the finance department clearance, appointments were done in violation of a personnel department guideline ‘that no contractual appointment should be done against permanent posts’, sources said. Usually, the Punjab Public Service Commission (PPSC) recruits Class-1 officers/faculty, but here walk-in-interview was organised to bypass the PPSC, the sources also claimedIn this case, the DRME office issued an advertisement of March 9, 2019, for filling the posts of seven readers and seven lecturers in Govt Ayurvedic College, and fixed March 16 as date for walk-in-interview for contractual appointments. The code of conduct for LS elections was announced on March 10. “The advertisement was published in the newspaper on March 9, 2019, but it did not have complete information about the number and departments in which the posts were to be filled. The complete advertisement was only made available on March 14 on the departmental website and the interview was conducted on March 16. As a result, candidates were not given enough time to plan for the interview and many deserving candidates did not even come to know about it. Only candidates from Patiala and nearby places turned up,” said a senior faculty member, pointing out the flaws in the recruitment process, including not following reservations rules.“Proper selection protocol/procedure was also not followed as no subject expert was called for screening candidates. There was nepotism, as some relatives and friends of employees were adjusted,” sources claimed. College principal Dr Harvinder Grover admitted that the finance department had not approved the appointments and not released the budget, resulting in faculty not being paid. On irregularities in appointment, she said, “I had only floated a demand for recruitment. It was the duty of the DRME and the secretary of the department to ensure all norms were followed.” Medical education secretary DK Tiwari said, “We have supplied all required information to the finance department, which will, hopefully, revert by this week.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/11-ayurvedic-college-teachers-in-patiala-appointed-without-finance-dept-nod/story-e3Ykypl98dRs8QyiCov3OL.html

04-05-2020||Chandigarh||At 795, Nanded pilgrims account for 66% cases in Punjab||Pilgrims who returned from Nanded in Maharashtra continued to push the Covid-19 count in Punjab on Monday, accounting for almost two-thirds of the positive cases in the state.Out of 2,200 returnees whose test reports have been received so far, 795, or say 36%, are positive. These numbers are likely to go up as test results of another 2,000 Sikh pilgrims are awaited. But things could get far worse than anticipated initially as no one is sure about the extent to which these returnees spread the infection. As they started reaching Punjab, 700 pilgrims were sent to their native places for ‘home quarantine’ after basic screening that included thermal scanning.In Amritsar and Ludhiana districts alone, 179 and 174 pilgrims were advised ‘home quarantine’ respectively. Jagjit Singh of Ghular Village said his father Kuldeep Singh’s paranoia saved the family from getting infected.“He locked himself in another room and told the family to maintain distance from him. It was only a day later that the health official took him to hospital where he tested positive,” he said.Both districts have seen a spike in positive cases. In Ludhiana, the district administration sealed five villages near Samrala and Machhiwara as a preventive measure. The state government started tracing and testing the pilgrims from Nanded only after three of them tested positive in Tarn Taran district on April 27. The health authorities have put 1,500 persons, mostly family members and close acquaintances who the returnees met on reaching home, in quarantine, but few of them have been tested so far.However, they are still to check the contacts of these pilgrims even there is strong suspicion that some of them interacted with several persons. “Our entire focus has been to test the pilgrims. The process may take another couple of days” a senior official said. Also, 120 drivers of government buses and private vehicles that ferried these pilgrims back have been kept in isolation and their department is waiting for their tests reports. A total of 4,169 people returned to the state from the Hazur Sahib gurdwara in Nanded in the past week.There are also reports that a few labourers from Punjab who were working in cotton factories in Maharashtra had also joined the pilgrims at the gurdwara and came back with them.CONFUSION OVER SOURCE OF VIRUSThough they have pushed the state’s tally of positive cases, these pilgrims as well as health authorities are clueless about the possible source of infection even after a week. A number of ailing pilgrims have, however, said that there were not tested at Nanded and no social distancing norms were followed in buses deployed for their evacuation.One of them said the buses were packed to capacity during the long journey from Nanded to Punjab. Another 32-year-old patient, who is currently at the Covid-19 facility in Bathinda, said most devotees and volunteers at the shrine never used to wear masks and there was no way of knowing if they were unwell. “During the entire journey, the AC was off but there were 38 persons on the bus,” he said.A 65-year-old devotee from a village in Bathinda said he had cough for about 15 days at the shrine but no medical advice was given to him. “A team of doctors used to visit the gurdwara sarai every five days, but no samples were taken. On the way back, the AC was on throughout and we stopped at 3-4 places. I don’t know where I contracted the virus,” he said.Despite there being no clarity on the source of infection, the governments of Maharashtra and Punjab are blaming each other. Maharashtra’s PWD minister Ashok Chavan, while categorically denying that pilgrims contracted the virus at Nanded, raised suspicion on the drivers of the Punjab government buses sent to ferry the pilgrims. In response, Punjab health minister Balbir Siidhu said he was more than sure that pilgrims got infected in Nanded, citing the positive cases there.

04-05-2020||Delhi||Lockdown 3.0: RWAs divided over calling domestic helps to work||On Monday, as their neighbourhood was finally ‘de-contained’ after almost a month, residents of Bengali market, Babar Road, Todarmal Road and nearby areas in central Delhi asked their domestic helps to resume work.Though a few of them did turn up to work immediately, resident welfare association (RWA) members said most of them would start coming from Tuesday.The Delhi government had on Sunday-- in line with a Union home ministry order-- allowed self-employed workers such as domestic helps, cooks, laundrymen, plumbers and electricians to resume work from Monday during the lockdown that has been extended with certain relaxations till May 17.Local authorities or police are not monitoring the movement of domestic helps, as they come under the ambit of self-employed people and are exempted by the government. Though the government has not empowered RWAs to keep a check on it, in most areas the welfare associations are requesting people not to allow domestic helps.“We have asked them to resume work. We plan to get their medical examination done at the local dispensary before they start work. We will request the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) for help,” said YK Anand, president of Babar Road and neighbouring RWAs.He said, “A large number of people here are senior citizens and it is difficult for them to work without domestic helps. All residents have been asked to take precautions at home while allowing these people to work.”In Lajpat Nagar, too, a lot of households allowed domestic workers. Gopal Thapa, a cook, said his employers are maintaining proper precautions. “My employers are following social distancing and asking me to wear a mask when I am in the house. They ask me to wash my hands and sanitise them at regular intervals,” he said.But not all RWAs are in favour of allowing domestic helps to return to work.Many residential societies in Dwarka have decided to wait for a few more days. Sudha Sinha, president of Federation of CGHS Dwarka limited, said, “We have requested residents in all societies to wait till May 17. There is no harm in waiting for a while, especially now when cases are increasing every day.”Poonam Arora, general secretary of the Federation of Alaknanda RWAs, too said, “We have paid our domestic helps full salaries for now. The choice has been left to individual households as to when they want their helps to come back to work. We have just requested people to avoid calling them in for the next few days.”Badan Singh (68), a resident of East Delhi, who runs an ironing shop in south Delhi’s Amar colony, said he went to his shop on Monday but did not start work. He said police stopped him quite a few times on his way.“The lockdown has been difficult as we did not have any money. We depend on our daily earnings to survive and have had to face a lot of problems. We somehow managed but just hope things are back on track soon,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/rwas-divided-over-calling-domestic-helps-to-work/story-vz7yjfHVXNVxrklGnzvYLP.html

04-05-2020||City||Life in the Times of Lockdown: ‘Beauty parlours need to opt for online medium to be in touch with clients’||“Beauty parlours will probably be the last establishments that the government will allow to operate due to the coronavirus outbreak, so we are left with no option, but to stay connected with our regular clients through the online medium and share beauty tips,” said Sachita Arora Grover, a city-based beauty parlour owner. 27-year-old Sanchita, who runs a beauty parlour in Model Town, said, “As in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic, social distancing is a paramount weapon, it will have a huge impact on the beauty industry in the long run.”“I’m not expecting that beauty parlours will open in the near future even if the situation is under control. The people in the beauty industry will probably be totally out of work, so we are slowly looking towards the digital world to connect with the clients online, an option, which was never considered earlier. It isn’t economically profitable, but at least we are in touch with our customers,” said Sanchita, who, in the changed situation, keeps herself busy making beauty regime videos for her Instagram page. “Almost, all my clients are now in touch with me on Instagram. I conduct regular polling, where I ask them what beauty regime or DIY (Do It Yourself) self-care tips they want to know about and they are interested in. I create my content on the basis of their demands,” she added. Sanchita, who is also a lecturer in the Wellness and Beauty Wing of Government College for Girls (CGC), said, “Besides creating videos for my clients, I am also routinely giving assignments to my students.” “I’m not sure whether teachers will receive the salary for this month or not, but I will continue with my work so that my students also continue with their studies even during the lockdown period,” she said. Sanchita, a resident of Civil Lines, also stressed on the importance of self-care during the lockdown period. “There are so many ingredients that are easily available in the kitchen and can be easily used for skincare. A mixture of a slice of bread, lukewarm milk, almond powder, saffron and jaggery can be used as an effective scrub for the skin. I also request people to use sunscreen lotion even if they are not going out during the lockdown period, as even at home the skin is still getting exposed to sun rays. Similarly, the women, who are worried about coarse hair on the skin in the absence of waxing should try to use razor,” Sanchita added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/life-in-the-times-of-lockdown-beauty-parlours-need-to-opt-for-online-medium-to-be-in-touch-with-clients/story-eFFjwxNCoiUhb9E6qpMb2J.html

The schools in question include the Government Primary School (GPS), Jawaddi; GPS, Sangowal; and GPS Nehru Memorial, which were open for two hours on Monday while GPS, Purvi 2, was open on Sunday, for carrying out the admission process.While some school heads stated that they were asked by the district authorities to increase the enrolment in their schools and visit the schools between 7am to 11am, others said that they had gone to the school for other work.Satvinder Kaur, school head of GPS, Sangowal, said, “I visited the school to collect the data of the students, so that their parents can be contacted to enhance enrolment in our school.

I have pasted our contact numbers outside the school and requested the nearby gurdwara authorities to keep announcing regarding the online admission process.”“Though there are no written orders by the education department to visit the schools, we need the data of the students to increase the enrolment and are left with no other option. Therefore, three teachers went to the school to collect the records,” she said.Parminder Kaur, school head, GPS, Jawaddi, (morning shift), said, “I had gone to the school to collect the records of the students. As heavy rains lashed the city last night, I went to inspect the mid-day meal kitchen where food grains have been stored since the last one-and-a-half month.

I guided them to apply online.”DEO REFUTES ALLEGATIONSRefuting the allegations, district education officer (DEO), elementary, Rajinder Kaur, said, “We have given no instructions to the school heads to visit the schools to increase the enrolment.

They also sent written information about the same to the department of education. Meanwhile, TET/STET Qualified Teachers’ Association said that they will decide on the same on Tuesday after their meeting.Earlier, Bihar education minister Krishna Nandan Verma had appealed to the school teachers twice to end their strike, but it did not work, as the teachers’ bodies stood firm on withdrawal of punitive action taken against teachers. On Monday, Verma said that the government had appointed all the teachers and will always take care of their needs.Nearly 4-lakh Bihar primary and middle school teachers were on strike since February 17, while the secondary and higher secondary teachers joined it from February 25 in support of their demand of ‘equal pay for equal work’ and proper service conditions.During the strike period, the teachers’ bodies claimed that 62 teachers lost their lives due to various ailments abetted by poor financial condition.The government had also announced ₹ 4-lakh ex-gratia payment to their families as per the provisions of death during the service period.Earlier, Mahajan had written to all the district education and programme officers regarding salary payment to all the teachers of Class 1-12, but not for the strike period in keeping with the government’s policy of ‘no work, no pay’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/teachers-call-off-strike-after-bihar-govt-agrees-to-withdraw-most-cases/story-AskVUnWyTxeUzoQ7YBu71K.html

State BJP president Sanjay Jaiswal also criticised the JD (U)-led NDA government. Following which, JD (U) minister Shrawan Kumar hit back, asking Jaiswal to consult BJP leader and deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi before opening his mouth.Meanwhile, the CM said that people were unnecessarily raking up a non-issue in the times of a crisis. “The government is working with a plan and there is little time to get distracted by unwarranted ‘bayanbazi’ (chit chat),” he said. Appreciating the Centre’s move to provide special trains, he said “I thank the Centre for considering my suggestion. Now that things have been set rolling, there is no need to worry. The students won’t be charged and state government will bear the rail fare paid by inbound migrants to reach heir home state from their respective work places (point of origin).”“Once these migrant workers or eligible people, arriving from outside the state, complete their 21-day isolation at designated quarantine centres, the expenses incurred for boarding special trains will be reimbursed. Thus, each worker will be getting a minimum of ₹1,000,” the CM said.Praised the people for observing the guidelines, he said, “With the exception of a few, majority people have played their part in making the lockdown a success.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/state-will-bear-students-fare-500-more-for-migrants-says-cm-nitish/story-6R4xizsyZPUQ7lmgyxDveK.html

They fled with two vehicles—Bolero and Lancer— a gold chain, a gold ring, three cellphones and ₹1.6 lakh in cash.Some inmates also told the police that they were regularly beaten at the centre. The complainant Vikramjit Singh, in his complaint to the police, said he runs a drug rehabilitation centre, with about 30 inmates, under the Bani foundation in Radiala village, Kharar. He said that about three years ago, Mohit Pandey had come to his centre and after being treated of the addiction, had started working with him.Pandey and the other accused attacked Vikramjit, who lives in the centre’s campus, with sharp weapons. Vikramjit said the accused bundled him in his vehicle and drove for about 60 km to Bellolpur village in Chamkaur Sahib. “They tied me to a tree in the jungle and beat me before fleeing with my valuables. They had picked up the cash from the centre,” he told the police. When he managed to free himself, he contacted the police and reached Kharar civil hospital, where he was admitted for treatment.“Raids are underway to arrest the accused who also took away CCTV cameras and the digital video recorder,” said Sukhvir Singh, station house officer Kharar (sadar).A case has been registered under Sections 307(attempt to murder), 392(robbery), 364 (Kidnapping in order to murder), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 324(voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons), 148 (rioting with deadly weapon) and 149 (unlawful assembly to prosecute common object) of the IPC in police station Kharar (sadar).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/6-inmates-booked-for-murder-bid-on-drug-rehab-centre-owner-in-kharar/story-xf2K9gKpUvdtGJsHjztnrK.html

04-05-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh’s ‘super spreader’ cries foul, seeks to clear name||While health workers across the country are being venerated for their roles at the frontline of the war on Covid, one health worker from Chandigarh has been rather mired in a controversy.Not long ago, the emergency OT attendant of Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) in Sector 32 was on active duty, but his life turned upside down when he was found infected with the virus following mild fever on April 24.His employer deserted him, saying he had caught the infection from outside, as he had thrown a party to celebrate his wedding anniversary at home with 123 people in attendance, a week before the infection on April 17.While the police lodged a criminal case against him, the media was quick to label him ‘super spreader’ after Bapudham colony, where he lives, turned in to the city’s first main hotspot, accounting for almost half of the city’s positive cases to date. In his locality, 51 persons tested positive, including eight of his family, three of who are his sister’s family in Sector 52 . Denying the allegations, he told HT on Monday that it was completely baseless that he had thrown a party. “The tiny terrace of my house cannot accommodate more than 10 persons, and they are saying I hosted a party for more than a 100 people,” he said. He further added that except for his three cousins, a close friend and family members, no other person was present at his house on the occasion.He asked that if he had hosted such a grand party, then why would he go for duty that day. “I had a morning shift from 8 am to 2 pm. When I returned home, we baked cake and celebrated among family only,” he said.The question then remains as to how so many people in Bapudham were infected? He said, “How do I know? Like me, nobody in my neighbourhood had symptoms. The virus could have entered the locality in so many ways. Holding me responsible is unjustifiable.”He said, “I am two hundred percent sure I got infected in the hospital.” He said despite several Covid cases, most GMCH staff had no PPE kits, which they started getting only after April 28. “I was not even given a N95 mask. I managed with a surgical mask worth ₹10. Despite this, we carried on working but slandering me is wrong,” he added.Police public relation officer, DSP Charanjit Singh Virk, said that police investigation did not find any evidence of partying at his residence. “Apart from the 19 members of his family who live in the house, only three to four friends and cousins were present,” he said.The first information about partying came from GMCH, said the DSP. “Dr NK Goyal, head of community medicine at GMCH, had given it to the police in writing that the OT attendant’s had 123 contacts, but he could not testify whether there was party at the attendant’s home,” the DSP said.Dr BS Chavan, director principal of GMCH-32, said that his statement to the media that there was party at the employee’s home was based upon the ground report given by Dr NK Goyal, who supervised contact tracing on the ground. “If now, he has changed his statement to the police, I will ask him in writing about it,” he said.When contacted, Goyal said, “My report was based on the statement of neighbours, but later they backed off from their testimony. What can we do? We had no material evidence.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-s-super-spreader-cries-foul-seeks-to-clear-name/story-lRwtbGwn8qnwaBXbNFXrfL.html

04-05-2020||Pune||Relaxations extended to 90% of Pune, says PMC chief Gaikwad||On the first day of lockdown 3.0 after the government eased some curbs, residents came out on the streets in large numbers on Monday although there was confusion among shopkeepers due to lack of clarity from the administration on what should be open. Pune municipal commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad said that relaxation has been extended to ninety per cent part of the city, and now restrictions are applicable to ten per cent of the areas which are micro-containment zones.Many stepped out to either visit offices or shops and were not stopped by police officials till 7pm, after which the restrictions are in place again. While the government order said that five standalone non-essential commodity shops can open on one street, more than five stores were seen operating at various places. By evening, police promised to act against unnecessary crowding.Pune police commissioner K Venkatesham said that each shop will have to ensure social distancing. “All shops are being given notice under Section 149 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) to ensure social distancing, which is the duty of the shopkeeper.”The easing of restrictions was spelt out in an order issued by joint police commissioner Ravindra Shisve on Sunday wherein he had permitted opening of five non-essential shops any given road and at the same time permitted opening of non-essential shops in areas outside the containment zones. At Kothrud, which has seen least number of Covid-19 cases in Pune, sweet and jewellery shops started operations while on Satara road, most shops were shut. In most parts of the city, vegetable and grocery shops were open till 6pm as against 2pm till Sunday as per the previous order.At Thergaon and Hadapsar, medical and grocery stores were open even after 2pm. Traffic on the road was moderate and there was rush at the shops, according to police officials.At Dange chowk in Pimpri-Chinchwad, some hardware shops were functioning with many customers. At some places, mobile repair shops were also open.“There is no crowding at our shop. I had managed to conduct good amount of trade since morning and I will keep my shop open till 6pm,” said P Deshpande, owner of a hardware store.Manjusha Kulkarni, a resident of Baner, said “The order talks of clusters, micro-clusters, containment zones and the outer perimeter of the city, but the task of reopening of shops has been given to the police who will decide based on the analysis of daily Covid-19 situation.“The ideal thing should have been that the PMC administration which governs the city should itself have ordered the opening of the shops and specified the timings. Today, the shops downed the shutters before time as the police came knocking on their doors,” said Kulkarni.In Sahakarnagar, Padmavati and Satara road- residents mainly came out to fill up fuel tanks, but there was no rush at grocery and milk shops. However, a large number of people turned up to shop for vegetables and essentials at NIBM, Undri, Mohammadwadi, Kondhwa, Salunke Vihar, Hadapsar and Market Yard on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/relaxations-extended-to-90-of-pune-says-pmc-chief-gaikwad/story-rCFCKs5yighS4YDoSOmtDO.html
04-05-2020||Mumbai||Consortium of 3 start-ups employs 5,000 migrant labourers to produce low-cost equipment||A consortium of three start-ups from various parts of the country is employing more than 5,000 stranded migrant labourers to produce low-cost ventilators and large-scale personal protective equipment (PPE) kits. Manufacturing over 40,000 kits a day from four factories -- two in Mumbai and two in Kolkata-- the three start-ups have partnered to provide PPE kits to 15 government and private entities across the country. Each kit includes protective gowns, shoe coverings, gloves, masks, goggles, face shield and a garbage bag for the disposal of items after use. All the elements, except goggles that are outsourced, are manufactured in the four sterilised factories.Workers manufacturing the items have been provided with food, boarding and sanitary items. “The PPE items have to be prepared in a sterilised set up. So it was necessary to provide the workers with hygienic conditions such as lodging and sanitisers. The workers follow social distancing norms in the factories and use masks and gloves,” said Hamza Shaikh, co-founder of Indobionics, a three-year-old medtech startup, incubated at the Indian Institute of Management (IIM)-Bengaluru. The others are Abstract Ideas, an aesthetics start-up incubated at the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B), and Agastya Bouyant, incubated at IIM Calcutta, that manufactures inflatables for the cleaning of water surfaces of rivers and sea.The consortium is also manufacturing low-cost ventilators that can be used in intensive care units (ICUs) across the country. While a high-end ICU ventilator can cost between ₹10 lakh and ₹15 lakh, these startups are building basic ICU ventilators at one-tenth the cost.“The key was to cut down on research and development cost and sourcing material hyper locally. This helped save our costs. Our designers studied the designs of ventilators from open-source materials and we replicate the same with inexpensive and locally available material,” said Shaikh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/consortium-of-3-start-ups-employs-5-000-migrant-labourers-to-produce-low-cost-equipment/story-PcBMJsaaGyCLe9aleQdqUK.html

It is on the basis of these false reports that the government is saying that Himachal Pradesh is becoming coronavirus free,” he alleged.The Congress leader said that at interstate barriers there was no proper arrangement and equipment for screening people arriving in the state and they were being allowed to enter after taking their names, addresses and phone numbers.This ill-conceived strategy of the state government may result in a dangerous situation in the state.“The government should carry out random testing across the state for Covid-19. Testing should be ramped up. Without tests, we cannot claim to become corona-free,” he said.Sharma also accused the state government of failing to provide necessary safety equipment like masks and PPE kits to the frontline warriors including health staff, police and administrative officers.“Staffs deployed at the borders are either without masks or using old masks. Health staffs have been provided raincoats instead of PPE kits,” he said adding that the government is yet to float tenders for purchase of masks, PPE kits and other equipment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hp-govt-misleading-centre-on-active-case-finding-campaign-cong-leader/story-lbZV2GYon0epwZaQxgtg7O.html

The construction work will hopefully begin within a week,” said Baramulla additional deputy commissioner Mohd Ahsan Mir.“We are opening some tenders today (Monday) and work will begin from next week,” said Karnah sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Bilal Mohiuddin Bhat.He said that Tangdhar needs huge bunkers because of good population in the tehsil. “The area is most vulnerable to the cross-border shelling,” he said.He said that the prototype of bunkers was changed owning to the lack of space. “Now, the construction of one bunker will cost us ₹10 lakh, which otherwise was ₹20 lakh,” he said. An official from the government wishing anonymity said that the UT administration is facing shortage of land to begin the construction. “People will have to cooperate with us for the same,” he said. As per the official, a single bunker will accommodate at least four families.In February, J&K home department had sanctioned 125 community bunkers with an aim to build shelters and safeguard human lives along the LoC from the arbitrary cross-border shelling . “I am directed to convey the sanction of 125 large community bunkers in Baramulla and Kupwara districts falling within 0-3 kilometres along the LoC,” reads the order forwarded to the Kashmir divisional commissioner.As per the order, 85 bunkers have been approved for Kupwara district that include 10 for Keran, 15 for Machil and 60 bunkers have been approved for Tangdhar tehsil. There will be 20 bunkers each in Uri and Boniyar tehsil. The government has approved ₹25 crore for the project. The order also reads that divisional commissioner Kashmir should constitute a committee for physical verification of bunkers and the work should be completed within three months. However, the residents living near LoC have expressed resentment over the decision of constructing community bunkers. “We have always demanded underground bunkers. New types of bunkers are not going to deliver well. They are not safe,” said Lal Din Khatana, sarpanch of Charunda village on LoC.“Given the recent border skirmishes, the residents living near the LoC are in state of panic. We fear for our lives,” said Irfan Ahmad, a resident of Baidan village of Boniyar. Three civilians, including an eight-year-old boy were killed after the cross-border shelling took place in Keran village of Kupwara district last month. Last week, two soldiers were killed, while six others were injured, including two soldiers, at Charunda village in Hajipeer sector of Uri.

04-05-2020||Chandigarh||Bar Council of Punjab and Haryana asks HC to resume court work||The Bar Council of Punjab and Haryana (BCPH) wrote to the high court (HC) and demanded that restrictive work in trial courts of both the states and Chandigarh and also HC be resumed.BCPH is an apex body of lawyers in Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh with nearly one lakh members. BCPH said that the high court should reconsider its decision of allowing hearing only through video conferencing while not allowing entry of advocates and clerks in the high court and other courts. The body said that the move was taken without considering the decision of the Centre and the UT administration on extension of lockdown, whereby, the government offices were allowed to function, markets were opened and even private offices were allowed to open with only certain restrictions.The Bar Council said, “More than 70% lawyers in districts and in the tricity live on rent and have no source of income other than the fee received from the clients.”It further said that not allowing hearing in extreme urgent cases will amount to denial of justice while adding that all advocates are not equipped with appearing through video conferencing.BCPH said that a committee, presided over by one of its member Lekh Raj Sharma, has also recommended that the functioning of courts with the minimum footfall be resumed. The committee had earlier requested that a limited number of advocates be allowed to appear in courts, while Bar rooms and canteens can be kept closed, added BCPH. Meanwhile, BCPH chairman Karanjit Singh said, “Around 1,800 lawyers are being given a financial aid of ₹ 5,000/- each. These have been selected from 3,400 applications invited by BCPH last month.” “The money was collected from lawyers and BCPH members through donations, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/bar-council-of-punjab-and-haryana-asks-hc-to-resume-court-work/story-Fn5CM4EWDN8ZY3eyKMPAtJ.html
04-05-2020||Mumbai||Despite lockdown extension, locals take to streets, ignore social distancing norms||A day after the Maharashtra government announced plans to lift certain lockdown restrictions in the state according to the Covid-19 zones, several areas in the city witnessed a surge in public activities. Several citizens complained about long queues outside alcohol shops as well as grocery stores. In some parts of the city, public transport such as autos and buses were also plying as usual.However, according to the announcement, in red zones, under which Mumbai falls, outside the containment zones, certain activities are still prohibited by the Ministry of Home Affairs. No relaxation was given to cycle rickshaws, autorickshaws, taxis and cab aggregators, intra- and inter-district plying of buses, functioning of barbershops, spas, and salons.Hakim Kapasi, who owns a medical store at Andheri, had witnessed a long queue to purchase alcohol from a neighbouring wine shop on Monday morning. Kapasi said there were more than 100 people who had gathered, waiting for the shop to open. “There was no social distancing and many of them did not wear masks. Some of them were spitting on the street as well. However, the shop didn’t open in the morning,” said Kapasi.Pervez Cooper, a resident of Colaba, stopped several people from getting haircuts outside a gym near Colaba Causeway. However, most of the other shops in his area were shut except for a grocery store.“The situation on the streets was ridiculous. Vagrants were sitting on the streets and at least 20 people were getting haircuts without any kind of social distancing,” said Cooper.In Ghatkopar, locals were seen gathering on the streets to chat, while ignoring social distancing guidelines. When Santosh Mehta, an IT professional, stepped out for some essential work, he noticed autos and taxis plying and people gathered on road to talk to each other. “It looked like authorities didn’t seem to care what was happening. There were so many people on the streets and it looked like most of them did not have any work to be out,” said Mehta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/despite-lockdown-extension-locals-take-to-streets-ignore-social-distancing-norms/story-zqzM6fc9u5dvX1015uy0YI.html

This is the highest package ever received by an UBS student. The native of Kurukshetra district in Haryana has been placed in Tolaram Group. Parth, whose father is an additional sub-inspector in the Haryana Police said, “I aimed to be placed in Tolaram Group for many years ,but I was uncertain as they hire only one student from UBS every year. I dedicate this achievement to my parents who always supported me, and my department.”Parth graduated as a pharmacy student from PU and then joined UBS. “I was already a student of PU and wanted to join UBS to further my career ,” he said.As per placement data released by PU, 103 of the 129 students who applied have been placed from UBS. The highest package received by a student last year was ₹53 lakh who was also placed in Tolaram Group.The average package of this year’s placement drive is ₹9.5 lakh. Notable companies that recruited students from UBS this year include American Express, Avery Dennison, Bacardi, Edelweiss Tokio, HSBC, Infosys, Tolaram, Volvo Eicher and HDFC.Sanjam Ghai, 24, a native of New Delhi has been placed in American Express. She received a package of ₹18.8 lakh per annum. “I shifted here from New Delhi as I wanted to get out of my comfort zone and UBS has a great legacy. I dedicate my achievement to my family and the faculty of the department,” she said. UBS chairperson Deepak Kapur said, “At a time when some companies are revoking final placement offers made by them, UBS is fortunate that it has not been affected negatively during this crisis. Perhaps, this is due to the strong bond UBS has developed with recruiters.”Kapur said he was confident recruiting companies would honour the final placement offers made to graduating students.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/panjab-university-s-ubs-student-receives-highest-package-of-55-lakh/story-DyNvhdpraWo2u11n49XsqN.html

However, traders said they received a lukewarm response while long queues were witnessed outside liquor vends and bookstores in the city.President of Chandigarh Beopar Mandal, Anil Vohra, who runs a shop in Sector 44, said, “Many people had come only to roam around in the markets or to find open liquor shops. Various videos were shared of long queues outside liquor shops but other traders didn’t see a sharp rise in customers.”President of the Market Welfare Association of Sector 11, Diwankar Sahoonja, said, “Grocery shops that had been open during the curfew as well recorded around a 30% increase in sales, but the liquor vends drew the most crowds. Many people also came from other sectors to the chemist shops in Sector 11 so there was a lot of rush in the market due to this.”More emphasis was on stores selling essentials, while those selling non-essential items were mostly ignored. Sudhir Jain, general secretary of the wholesale cloth merchant association of Chandigarh, said that sales barely reached 10% of their normal daily sales, but it felt nice running their shop again. President of the crockery association of the city, Ram Bilas Aggarwal, said although some crockery shops were opened in the city, almost no sales were recorded. “Until movement from Punjab and Haryana is not allowed, sales will not pick up,” he said.While a long queue was seen in front of the liquor vend in Sector 9, other shops didn’t get as many customers. Rustam Singh, who hails from New Chandigarh, said he had come to Sector 9 to buy groceries, but seeing the liquor vend open he had decided to make a stop for alcohol first. Many parents were also lined outside bookstores outside Manchanda Stores in Sector 19. Harjit Singh whose ward studies at St Anne’s in Sector 32 said they were getting books in advance even though the school hadn’t asked them to purchase them yet. Another parent said that a printer is needed for online classes, and those who couldn’t afford one had to queue up for books.TRANSIT TROUBLE FOR SHOPKEEPERS FROM PANCHKULA, MOHALIMany shopkeepers who were to come from Mohali and Panchkula also didn’t go to their shops on the first day just to let things smooth over first. Samrat Arora, an optician in Sector 22 who stays in Panchkula, said he had not gone to his shop fearing the confusion at the boundary of Panchkula and Chandigarh. “We were assured that we would face no difficulty, however it took commuters over an hour to pass because of police deployment and checking. Some shopkeepers were also not allowed to enter back into Panchkula,” he said.Chairman of Chandigarh Beopar Mandal, Charanjiv Singh, said he had received many calls from people facing similar problems and he would apprise the deputy commissioner of the matter to figure out a solution for the shopkeepers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/liquor-vends-book-stores-rake-in-big-others-await-customers-as-lockdown-restrictions-ease-in-chandigarh/story-TtzKMovnBPl5nKoBg8OXKL.html
04-05-2020||Chandigarh||Morning walkers get cold feet despite relaxations, Chandigarh parks remain empty||Even as curbs were lifted in the city and morning walkers were officially allowed to venture out for their routines from 7 am onward, most big parks and gardens in the city wore a deserted look, with only a handful of walkers visible.Rose Garden and the adjoining Shanti Kunj are popular destinations with morning walkers. One lap on the jogging track of the Rose Garden, about 2,200 metres, is one of the longest in the city. However, both wore an empty look on Monday even as the clock struck 8 am.Principal of Sector 39-C Government Model Senior Secondary School, Meenakshi Aneja, who was out for a stroll with her husband at Shanti Kunj said it felt good to be out again. “We are routine walkers here and had been walking in the drive way of our home in Sector 16 for the past few weeks,” she said.Three senior citizens were spotted sitting together in Rose Garden. Of the three, Ashok Malhotra, who is a tax consultant and Iqbal Singh, who is a retired government official, were engaged in a debate about who was the first one to enter the garden after the curfew. “We are a group of eight senior citizens and would take three to four rounds of the park. For the first time in 15 years our practice was interrupted for more than a month,” said Malhotra.Another senior, Sriram Gupta, who had come to feed birds, commented that he expected the Rose Garden to look cleaner and more pristine than ever, but it painted a picture of neglect with leaves strewn everywhere and the grass in dire need of a cut. Even the entrance of the park from the Leisure Valley side was blocked by broken branches discouraging many people from entering the park.Several people opined that the administrations ambiguity about morning walks and the recent flip flops had discouraged many from coming out for their daily exercise. Recent rain and thunder had muddied parts of the garden due to which some people had taken a rain check.Many regular walkers said they had also spotted Punjab director general of police (DGP) Dinkar Gupta walking here around 8 pm.A teacher at Doon School, Ramneet, said she was glad the curfew restrictions had been lifted. “We can’t stay at home forever and have to learn to deal with Covid-19 in better ways. I had also written to UT adviser Manoj Parida about this,” she said.While curfew restrictions were underway, police had been cracking down on morning walkers. As per police records, 213 morning and evening walkers had been booked under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) between 23 March and 3 May over the violation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/morning-walkers-get-cold-feet-despite-relaxations-chandigarh-parks-remain-empty/story-zQCohrE98KB2dP9ZZ1mS3O.html

Government should pay us travel allowance for this period,” he said.WILL CONSIDER DEMANDS: BALBIR SINGH SIDHU Later in the late evening, the union members postponed the strike after state health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu assured them of considering their demands and discussing them with chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh.The union president said that the health minister received their memorandum after which they have postponed the protest and will resume services from Tuesday.ADDICTS FACED TOUGH TIMEA 29-year-old youth of Gian Colony in Patiala, is worried as he was not attended to at the OOAT Clinic in Saket Hospital. He waited for three hours to take dose of buprenorphine-naloxone.He said, “I was addicted to smack for a long time and have been receiving treatment from 18 months.

I don’t want to relapse.”Another 30-year-old of Hera Nagar said, “Employees of OOAT clinic are not attending to us.”Patiala deputy medical commissioner Dr MS Dhaliwal said, “The staff was on strike across state.

In his letter to Shah, the CM said that his government would indicate its daily requirement of trains in advance.“A large number of labourers come seasonally from UP, Bihar and other eastern states to seek temporary employment in both industrial and agricultural sector in Punjab. These people, who were due to leave in March, normally after Holi, could not leave due to the imposition of lockdown this year,” the CM adds in his letter. ‘Allow micro industry in non-containment zones’Expressing concern over the plight of tiny, micro, cottage and small industries amid the continued lockdown, the CM on Monday sought the Centre’s permission to allow these to operate by engaging labour from the family or the neighbourhood. In his letter to Shah, the CM also points out that most industrial cities of Punjab had recently come in the red zone, largely on account of people who had from other states. He added that these restrictions had made it difficult for industry to resume operation. Often these small and tiny units were vendors of large units and supplied them with some essential components, failing which even large units, even though permitted, cannot function, he further observed, seeking amendment to the instructions/guidelines issued by the Union home secretary under section 10(2) (I) of the Disaster Management Act 2005, whereby certain industries in urban areas, other than containment zones, have been permitted to function. The CM has solicited Shah’s prompt intervention in amending these guidelines, under para 7 (ii) (b).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/amarinder-seeks-shah-s-intervention-for-special-trains-for-migrant-workers/story-0svnzRyNE2kbpCtx6VmwxL.html

Many had reached clinics much before they opened.Migrants from Kharghar and Panvel are still doing the rounds for a medical certificate but haven’t got one.Babasaheb J Tupe, senior police inspector, Kamothe police station, said, “There was confusion as migrants scrambled to get all papers in place. They have been told that they can get a fitness certificate from any registered clinic after paying.”He added that they are organising medical camps to ensure everyone gets a certificate.The police also appealed to clinics and other private doctors to help workers get a certificate without inconveniencing other patients.“Private doctors are charging around Rs350 for issuing a certificate. The government clinics are charging less but have longer queues. I returned after seeing the crowd,” said Bilal Ansari, 46, a daily wage worker from Uttar Pradesh, who has been making rounds of the police station to get more information.Pradeep Singh, 35, from Jharkhand, said he would prefer going home as it has become difficult to live here without earning.“For the past two to three days, we have been busy in paperwork. But, we are desperate to go back to the home. There has been no income for the past two months. It is difficult to practise social distancing in the slums,” Singh said.Many said there was no clarity and that they are getting information in bits and pieces.“We didn’t know about medical camps. We waited in long queues at the clinic and came to know about the camps later,” said Doman P, 45, a daily wage labourer from Bihar.Activist Suhash Jha said, “Considering the sheer number of migrants wanting to leave city, authorities should have been prepared for the long queues. However, clear guidelines would have eased the migrants’ anxiety. The medical camp will make the process smoother.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/migrants-in-navi-mumbai-hassled-with-paper-work-but-want-to-return-home/story-QyLNU8fQS82EFWGDayI5jL.html

Pune police commissioner K Venkatesham said, “We are flooded with requests for travel and permissions from expectant mothers. We are allowing them to travel within reasonable distance, but not all.” Similarly district collector Naval Kishore Ram said each and every individual request from pregnant women was being scrutinised and only those for whom travel was feasible were being allowed.” While a number of women wanted to travel within the city, some, like Sony Kumari, wanted to go other states, as far as Jharkhand. Seven months pregnant, Kumari has been writing to the police for the past four days to allow her to travel by her own vehicle back home. Anumeha Singh Mahajan was elated that she will welcome her first child in June this year at her maternal home in Hadapsar, Pune “My husband is stuck in Bangkok since March-end, and I was alone at home in Rahatne, I am in my ninth month, and I needed to travel to my parents’ home,” she said. Two weeks ago, Mahajan received permission from the police for her medical check-ups and for travelling to her parents’ home across the city at Hadapsar. She had to change her hospital for her delivery which will now happen at Hadapsar. Neha Patil, who is due for delivery in June is looking forward to visit her parents in Nashik for the delivery. “There is a lot of excitement in my maternal home, with this being the first grandchild for my parents. I was registered for delivery in Nashik, but I was prepared to deliver my child in Pune, if the permission did not come through,” said Patil.She said that she lives with her husband in Chinchwad and this was her first delivery and therefore, she wanted to stay with her parents because of the high emotions involved.“There is no one to take care of me in Pune and therefore I applied for permission to travel inter-city to Nashik. The police responded to my phone and my tweet. We will be travelling by our car. It took time to get the permission and I was prepared to deliver in Pune in case I didn’t get my permission,” said Patil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/expectant-mothers-among-those-wanting-to-travel-to-maternal-homes/story-7DUIBFiDCypwOSsVO2gvQP.html

04-05-2020||Mumbai||Bail plea of 10 Indonesian nationals who attended Tablighi Jamaat rejected||The metropolitan magistrate court on Monday rejected a bail plea of 10 Indonesian nationals who had been arrested in April after they attended the Tablighi Jamaat gathering at Nizamuddin Markaz in Delhi and failed to disclose this information to the police. The 10 accused will remain in judicial custody till May 11.A total of 12 people, including the arrested accused (six men and six women) from Indonesia had visited Delhi in March for the religious meet. After attending the meet they came to Mumbai on March 7 and were staying at an apartment in Bandra. Two of them are currently still under quarantine.The accused were booked for attempt to murder and culpable homicide not amounting to murder, under the Indian Penal Code, along with other charges. They were arrested by the Bandra police on April 23.Their defense lawyer Ishrat Khan, while seeking bail for the 10 accused, had pleaded that charges of attempt to murder and culpable homicide not amounting to murder, do not apply to the case.On Monday, when the plea came up for hearing, the prosecution failed to submit a reply on the bail plea. The defense, however, pleaded that looking at the charges applied by the prosecution, the magistrate did not have jurisdiction.The court considered the defendants’ argument and rejected the plea.

04-05-2020||Mumbai||PIL challenges quarantine of 1,408 people in Nagpur by civic body||The Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court has directed the state and Nagpur civic authorities to respond to a plea challenging the shifting of 1,408 persons, which include women and children from Covid-19 hotspots, to an institutional quarantine. The plea has alleged that though the authorities have taken a precautionary measure, the detention is illegal as the place, where these persons are quarantined, are crowded, and there is a possibility of causing infection to other persons residing near these two places.On Sunday, a single bench of justice Anil Kilor took up the urgent hearing of public interest litigation (PIL) filed by local resident Mohammad Nishat through advocate Tushar Mandlekar. The PIL alleged non-compliance of Covid-19 guidelines by the civic body and that people were being randomly picked up by the authorities and were being quarantined. The plea further said that 1,408 persons from Satranjipura and Mominpura areas were illegally detained by the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) on the grounds that they were high-risk contacts as they had come in touch with those who tested positive for Covid-19.The action was prompted after a 68-year-old man who tested positive died in Satranjipura. The man had come in contact with a person who had returned from the Tablighi Jamaat event in Delhi. The number of Covid positive cases had started increasing thereafter and hence the NMC decided to take such drastic precautionary measures.Mandlekar submitted that in doing so the authorities violated protocols and guidelines issued by the Central Government and Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) which stipulated that only persons who are Covid-positive and their contacts could be detained and quarantined for 14 days. However, as the NMC was randomly quarantining people it amounted to an infringement of the fundamental rights of freedom of expression and right to life with dignity of these people.On its part, the NMC counsel Sudhir Puranik submitted a response of Dr Pravin Gantawar from the NMC health department which stated that the civic body was strictly following COVID-19 guidelines and all quarantined persons were from the ‘high-risk contact category’ and proper precautions were being taken before putting people in quarantine. Puranik sought further two days to file a reply which was allowed and the matter has been posted for hearing on May 5.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/pil-challenges-quarantine-of-1-408-people-in-nagpur-by-civic-body/story-M6SW8mf2oZNBahVMJLXxoK.html

Some Punjab police personnel could be seen assisting the singer as he fires from the ‘official weapon’ at the target. Six cops have been suspended.Senior superintendent of police (SSP) Sandeep Garg said the incident took place at Badbar village on May 1. “Six police personnel, who assisted the singer, have been suspended and a departmental inquiry has been ordered against them,” said Garg.The accused have been identified as assistant sub-inspectors Balkar Singh, Antarjit Singh, Ram Singh; head constable Gurjinder Singh, and constables Jasbir Singh and Harwinder Singh.“All these cops were deployed with the office of deputy superintendent of police (headquarter), Sangrur.

04-05-2020||Chandigarh||Liquor prices jacked up 30% as people queue up outside vends||That city residents love their tipple was evident from the long queues outside liquor shops opening after 41 days as the administration eased Covid-19 restrictions from Monday. However, buyers complained of overbilling by as much as 30%, and said social distancing norms were not followed at some spots.Apart from serpentine queues outside the vends, complaints of overbilling by vendors were received from some places. “I bought a two litre bottle of Blenders Pride. The price printed on the label was Rs 1,600 but the vendor charged me Rs 2,000 and said “take it or leave it” when I protested,” complained a man buying liquor at Sector 15 who did not want to be named.A bottle of Sterling Reserve priced at Rs 350 was selling for Rs 450. Tuborg beer, priced at Rs 85, was being sold for Rs 150. With a pre-lockdown price of Rs 360, a Royal Stag bottle was going for Rs 500.The sharp increase in prices, industry insiders said, was attributable to strong demand as only 40% of the total licensed liquor vends were operating.On Sunday, the UT Administration had allowed shops selling non-essential items, including liquor, to open. Shopkeepers had to ensure that a maximum five persons were present at one time at the shop, with timings fixed from 10 am to 6 pm.The administration had closed down the liquor shops after it imposed curfew in the city on March 24 for containing the spread of covid-19 in the city.NOT ALL VENDS OPENRK Chaudhary, assistant commissioner, UT excise and taxation department said, “There are 75 licensed liquor vends in the city. Of these 60 will be functional during the lockdown restrictions. Fifteen vends located on sector dividing roads (Madhya Marg, Dakshin Marg, etc) and containment zones are closed as per the administration’s orders. On Monday, 30 liquor vends were open, all even numbered shops,” he said, referring to the odd-even scheme in the city.TEAMS FORMED TO ENSURE SOCIAL DISTANCINGEven as the department fixes only the minimum prices, the liquor vendors can fix prices above this minimum price, Chaudhary said, adding that department has asked the vendors not to overcharge buyers.On Monday afternoon, UT excise department officials went into a huddle to address the complaints of overcharging and issues of social distancing norms not being adhered to. The police department also raised concerns to the excise department about crowd management.On reports that vends at some places such as Manimajra and Sector 21 had to be closed because of the rush of buyers, Caudhary said, “There were no untoward incidents, though there were minor hiccups, which were resolved.”“We have formed teams under excise and taxation officers (ETO) who will monitor the sale of liquor. They will ensure that social distancing norms are followed,” added Chaudhary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/crowds-out-for-liquor-some-forget-about-distancing-some-shops-overcharge/story-liLvwrNzrtRJFVcNUnR2cK.html
04-05-2020||City||Kharghar resident loses ₹2 lakh to online fraud||A college lecturer from Kharghar lost ₹2 lakh after a caller told her bank account has been blocked.Kavita Sawant, 32, received a text message on April 27 that her bank account has been blocked and she needs to contact the customer care.When Sawant called the phone number mentioned in the text message, a man answered the call and he told her that her savings account will be frozen if she did not update her Know Your Customer (KYC) details.The man told her she should do it immediately.To verify if he is actually calling from the bank, she asked him her account statement. When he told her she had ₹6.5 lakh in her bank account, she believed it to be a genuine call, said the police.Telling her she needs a new user ID, he created it for her on the call. The woman later received a message from the bank that a payee had been added to her account for transfer of funds.After 30 minutes, the accused called her again and asked for the one time password (OTP) using which he transferred around ₹1 lakh twice. “The accused also told her the money would be transferred to her account in six transactions. The man’s phone was switched off immediately and the woman realised it was a scam,” said an officer from Kharghar police station.The Kharghar police have registered a case of cheating against the person under the Information Technology Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kharghar-resident-loses-2-lakh-to-online-fraud/story-sIVsU9ZPTyw5RDWDIzQNCP.html
04-05-2020||Mumbai||Marginal increase in peak hour traffic after ease in restrictions||With the Maharashtra government easing restriction in non-containment areas, a marginal increase in vehicular traffic was observed during the morning peak hours of Monday.Slow moving traffic was reported in certain patches of arterial roads in the city, such as western express highway (WEH), eastern express highway (EEH) and Sion-Panvel highway. These major roads connect Mumbai with neighbouring cities of Mira Road, Thane and Navi Mumbai. Toll collection plazas at Dahisar, Mulund (EEH and Lal Bahadur Shastri road), and Vashi witnessed the usual slow traffic during the peak hour. However, the traffic was partly due to the barricades installed by the police to check that only people working with essential services or emergency cases are out on the road. “Checking of vehicles is underway and only permitted services and medical emergency is allowed,” said Pravin Padwal, additional commissioner of police (traffic). The traffic control room of the Mumbai Police stated there were no major snarls reported in the city. The state has also allowed functioning of standalone liquor shops in Mumbai, which is a red zone. “We expect shop-keepers will be moving around to warehouses and stockist beginning from Monday to fill up the stocks. We expect this movement to increase from Tuesday,” said a traffic police officer.Lack of public transport and the need to maintain social distancing has resulted in citizens taking their vehicles out on the roads, causing a major hindrance to the administration. Those in essential services are also using their own vehicles as up to three people are allowed in four-wheelers including the driver and no pillion ride is allowed for two-wheelers. In order to ensure vehicles do not create traffic on road, the traffic police had earlier said they would suspend licenses of motorists caught twice for using their vehicles unnecessarily.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/marginal-increase-in-peak-hour-traffic-after-ease-in-restrictions/story-YEaB8GAypf5x2R16uu1GYK.html
04-05-2020||Chandigarh||Screening holds up vehicles, long queues at Chandigarh borders, some enter without checks||Chaos ruled at Chandigarh’s borders as curfew imposed to prevent Covid-19 transmission was lifted on Monday. Long vehicle queues formed at the main entry points as police screening slowed things, but many entered the city unchecked because of the heavy traffic buildup.Stationery shops which opened today were crowded too, all social distancing norms forgotten as people bought books and other essentials for their children’s new school terms.Panchkula, however, reported no such problem as adequate arrangements were made to stop cars and screen passengers and their documents.Scores of vehicles from Mohali and Panchkula entered Chandigarh in the morning as shops for non-essential items and offices opened and intercity movement was allowed for people with the requisite permissions and identity cards.However, because of the rush, police personnel could not screen everyone with thermal scanners. “It is difficult screening each and every vehicle entering the city. Today, the flow of vehicles increased tremendously and people were getting impatient when asked to wait. It put us under pressure at the checkpoints. So, some vehicles drove by without screening,” said a policeman on duty near the Zirakpur-Chandigarh barrier, requesting anonymity.Similar problems were reported at the Panchkula-Chandigarh housing board light point.“People were also flouting two-wheel norms and instead of just one rider, two were on the vehicle. In fact, some people were asked to get down from their scooters and motorcycles and walk back home,” the policeman added.Likewise, parents too crowded stationery and book shops without following social distancing norms to buy books, bags and other essentials for their children before the beginning of new school terms.Very few vehicles, however, moved from Chandigarh to Mohali.In Panchkula, the police managed to keep a strict vigil at checkpoints, only letting in people with passes issued by the district administration after announcements were made on Friday of very stringent screening processes and sealing of entry points.“We have strict orders not to allow anyone from Chandigarh into Panchkula without a pass. Everyone will go through medical screening. Those without a pass will be sent back,” said a police official on duty at the housing board point.After Chandigarh announced intercity travel from Monday, the Panchkula administration on Sunday imposed strict control on entry of outsiders with the exception of essential services.On May 1 the deputy commissioner had ordered managements of organisations asking people from outside to come into Panchkula for work to make arrangements for their accommodation within the city/district. Locals who needed to travel too had to make similar arrangements to prevent daily cross-border transit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/screening-holds-up-vehicles-long-queues-at-chandigarh-borders-some-enter-without-checks/story-DdjSlX2bezBm1gSqg7BbSO.html
04-05-2020||Pune||Monday Musings: Moving forward, with ‘cautious optimism’ during the Covid-19 pandemic||More than a month ago, on March 26, to be precise, a data analyst in Pune had described the Covid-19 situation in India as “cautiously optimistic”.Based on the analysis of the available numbers, analyst Sahil Deo had pointed out that the rise in the positive cases in India was well below the global benchmark of 33 per cent increase in cases per day and doubling of cases every 2.1 days. Anything below that was a good sign, he had said while describing the situation as “cautiously optimistic” given the timely measures taken by the state and central governments. As of March 26, there were about 600 positive cases in the country as against the 39,900 cases today.Another note of optimism came from Bengaluru where Kiran Mazumdar Shaw, the leading voice of the Indian biotech industry said that India had tackled the coronavirus much better than many other countries. She suggested in a recent interview that smaller red zones be created rather than entire districts to facilitate the resumption of economic activities and enable people to return to their livelihoods. Mazumdar Shaw pointed out that India had declared lockdown when the country had about 500 cases whereas Italy did it when it had 9,000 cases and the UK, 6,700 cases. The strict pre-emptive measures such as quarantine, curfew, lockdown, and surveillance had stood India in good stead. The social structure in India is different as compared to western countries and therefore, we did not have as many senior citizens dying as happened in the West, she noted. Thus, there are valid reasons for us to be optimistic even as we need to be cautious as Pune moves forward, some two months after Maharashtra’s first Covid-19 positive case was reported on March 9 in this city. In Pune, which has seen 103 deaths and 1,700 positive cases as of May 2, the concentration of cases is in a few slum pockets in five wards. Pune municipal commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad has already indicated that lockdown restrictions would continue in these micro-clusters and the situation would be gradually relaxed in the rest of the city to allow resumption of economic activity. The details of this are yet to be announced. The safe return of poor migrants and others stranded due to the lockdown, along with the phased lifting of the restrictions will be the most immediate challenges before the administration. Last week, a group of city doctors helped create public awareness as they sought to dispel the fears in the public about the final rites of patients who had died of Covid-19. This group of doctors from the Prayas Health Group and the Poona Citizen Doctor Forum pointed out that according to the guidelines by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Covid-19 is a respiratory disease and the spread stops when the patient dies. The only safety measure that needs to be observed is to stay away from the viruses present on the body surface and secretions from nose and mouth. They then explained the clear guidelines for healthcare workers, mortuary staff and others directly handling bodies, and family members, priests and mourners. There was no reason to fear infection if the basic guidelines were followed, the doctors advised.This advisory should have come in, say, after the 50th death itself because by then, there was a lot of panic in Pune with regards to the last rites of such patients. The coming weeks are now going to be critical as the city prepares to move forward, hopefully, with a lot of caution, and certainly, with optimism. abhay.vaidya@hindustantimes.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/monday-musings-moving-forward-with-cautious-optimism-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/story-stuxvCrLvZxtZi4uvlpz6I.html

04-05-2020||Chandigarh||Time for smiles, prayers, friends’ reunions and exercise at the Sukhna Lake||Former Punjab education board employee OP Bansal, aged 73, joined his hands and closed his eyes in prayer once he reached Sukhna Lake on Monday morning.As the UT administration lifted the curfew imposed in the city from March 24 to check the transmission of Covid-19, and allowed people to take their morning constitutional, Bansal said being by the lakeside in the early hours “was a simple joy” that he had missed terribly.Another walker, O Midha, director, department of laws, Chandigarh University, turned 52 on Monday. Being able to walk at the Sukhna was the “best birthday present ever,” he said.Drenched in sweat, 25-year-old Sumedh Kumar, a technician, said nothing could replace the feeling of jogging at the beautiful spot. Ecstatic at being allowed out after being cooped up indoors for 41 days most regulars reached the lake early in the morning to resume their routine. By 8 am more than 40 people had gathered there to walk, exercise and run.Anuj Khattar, aged 53, a BPO owner, said he had been walking every morning around the lake for over 35 years. “Nothing can compare with the satisfaction I got today as we were missing our lake. Although there are fewer people today as the restrictions have been just been removed, hopefully more people should join us soon.”“Finally we can come out for walks, who had imagined that such simple things would be taken away from us. Now we are more appreciative of the good things in life,” said Vinod Bansal, aged 40, an engineer.A third year student at the University Institute of Legal Studies, Panjab University, who did not wish to be named, said, “I have come here for fresh air after spending days at home. I haven’t told my parents as they would get upset, but I really needed this break.”Midha and Alok Sharma, a doctor, both walking partners here since 1997, have seen each other for the first time after the lockdown.“I thank the almighty that I could come here on my birthday to meet my friends,” smiled Midha.And even as Covid-19 cases continue to rise in the city, Sharma added, “We are aware of the dangers that coronavirus poses and are taking all precautions, including social distancing and wearing masks, but the joy of walking at the lake is unparalleled.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/time-for-smiles-prayers-friends-reunions-and-exercise-at-the-sukhna-lake/story-Nk06X09FUKQTVvH1svxHdI.html

04-05-2020||Delhi||Union minister against easing Delhi curbs after CM’s ‘time to reopen’ remark||A day after Arvind Kejriwal’s “time to reopen Delhi” remark, Union Health minister Harsh Vardhan on Monday said minimum relaxations should be given by the Delhi government to curb the spread of the coronavirus infection. The Centre last week extended the nationwide lockdown, necessitated by the coronavirus outbreak, by another two weeks, till May 17. However, it has provided some relaxations depending upon the colour-coded - red, orange, green - zones.The minister hesitated in voicing his opinion, lest it be given a political twist. “It would not be right for me to comment as it will be seen as a political statement. On a personal level, I think a lot needs to be done to halt the spread of the coronavirus. In this lockdown 3, I think that minimum relaxations should be given by the Delhi government. But this decision has to be taken by the state. Guidelines have been issued by the home ministry but the states are free to decide,” the minister told reporters. Watch l ‘Delhi should have minimum relaxations’: Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan On Sunday evening, Arvind Kejriwal said the Delhi government will suggest to the Centre that only containment areas in the city be declared as red zones and not the entire district. At present, all 11 districts in the city have been declared as red zones.“The time has come to re-open Delhi. We will have to be ready to live with coronavirus. The lockdown was necessary to contain Covid-19, but Delhi is fully ready to relax lockdown restrictions,” the Delhi chief minister said.Delhi has been under lockdown since March 23.The chief minister said coronavirus is going nowhere and it is impossible that cases of coronavirus will be zero.“Corona(virus) has come. It is impossible that there will be no cases of coronavirus because it has not happened across the country,” he said.Highlighting the adverse impact of coronavirus on the exchequer, Kejriwal said in April 2019, the government earned Rs 3,500 crore while in April this year, it only received Rs 300 crore. He said the Centre has put the entire Delhi under red zone due to which markets, malls cannot open.“We have suggested the Centre to seal those areas where cases of coronavirus have been reported and rest of areas can be allowed for the operation of all activities,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/union-minister-against-easing-delhi-curbs-after-cm-s-time-to-reopen-remark/story-DXapUsOfYkRCorWDOm0r8J.html
04-05-2020||Delhi||Delhi RWAs urge govt to shut down all liquor shops in city||After long queues outside liquor shops in the national capital took social distancing norms for a ride, the Resident Welfare Associations (RWA’s) in the city have urged the government to immediately close down all liquor vends and review arrangements.Several Resident Welfare Associations in Delhi have strongly objected to opening of liquor shops in most parts of the city despite entire Delhi being declared as a Red Zone with over 4,459 coronavirus cases .“The long queues started early in the morning outside liquor shops, even before the shops opened for sale, which led to social distancing going for a toss, in some areas it became a law and order problem and some vends had to be shut,” said V.K. Arora, Convenor of Delhi RWA Forum.Some even suggested the Delhi government to first review the situation and open the vends in proper phased manner to ensure that no social distancing norms are flouted. “The first day of opening of liquor vends was tricky and has already led to long queues and chaos in the city, the government should immediately shut the liquor vends and come up with a policy to regulate the sale by opening in phased manner,” said Rajiv Kakria, member of the RWA of Greater Kailash 1. “The government can adopt odd-even formula to control crowds, can think about home delivery of liquor on lines of the West Bengal government, can introduce rationing per person to prevent hoarding or black marketing,” Kakria suggested. One such unique suggestion came from the General Secretary of Green Park Extension RWA, who suggested to rope in RWAs to distribute liquor. “Even RWA’s can be roped in for distribution of liquor,” Puri said.Many others pointed out at the high risk that these long queues, as they claimed not just liquor shops but unchecked plying of autos and rikshaws, is also a concern. “Delhi is already witnessing high rise of coronavirus cases in the last couple of days, with limited government medical facilities it is looking for further troubles,” said V.N. Bali of East Delhi RWA federation. With the Delhi government opening around 150 select state-run liquor shops in the city, long queues and violation of social distancing norms were witnessed at many places in the national capital on Monday, forcing many such stores to close down.Buyers had begun to gather outside many liquor shops, allowed to operate, as early as 8.30 a.m. leading to long queues. According to a Delhi government official, about 150 liquor shops have been allowed to open in accordance with the latest lockdown relaxations given by the Ministry of Home Affairs.There are around 850 liquor shops in the city, including those run by the state government agencies and private individuals. In the order that allowed these shops to be reopened, the Delhi government instructed all shop incharges and other staff to report at their respective shops at 7 a.m. sharp from Monday onwards.

Sub-divisional magistrate of Bharatpur city Sanjay Goyal said that the private buses that ferried Bengal students studying in Kota’s coaching institutes to the eastern state brought back 510 Rajasthan migrants from Kolkata on their return journey.“All migrants are being sent to their districts by buses after screening by medical department at Uncha Nagla,” he said.Goyal added that the migrants have been put up in government school of Behnera village near Agra-Jaipur national highway No. 21 for medical screening and breakfast. The district administration has arranged food and other facilities for them. In all, 40 buses will bring 973 workers back to the state from West Bengal including the 17 that arrived on Monday morning. The remaining buses are on the way. Meanwhile, 16 buses carrying Rajasthan’s migrant workers from Guwahati in Assam reached Bharatpur late on Sunday night. They were later sent onwards to their home districts.Mahesh Kumar Pandey, a worker who belongs to Bikaner, said, “We have been living in Kolkata for a long time and worked as daily wage labourer.“My five-month-old child has liver problem. The Kolkata hospital where he was admitted discharged him after referring him to a higher centre. I will now take him to Bikaner hospital,” he said. Vrijendra Meena from Jhunjhunu alleged the West Bengal government did not provide them food and medical facilities. “The owner of house was putting pressure on me to pay rent but we had no money because we had no work due to the lockdown,” he said.Kamlesh Chaudhary and Bhavesh Chaudhary from Pali also said they faced difficulty in paying rent. “We had no food and no money to pay rent. We thank Rajasthan government for bringing us home,” he said. “Our families here were worried. We will meet them after a long time,” said Bhuri Lal from Jodhpur, who came with his wife and kids.Till now, 100,000 migrants have returned to Rajasthan from other states while the state has sent 56,000 persons back to their states.The Centre has allowed the movement of migrant workers, tourists, students stranded in other states due to lockdown back to their home states. This is taking place through special trains being run by the Indian Railways and through buses.The third phase of nationwide lockdown kicked in from Monday with some relaxations in the restrictions. The states and Union Territories have drafted their own rules, mostly in line with federal guidelines that have given area-specific relaxations in a graded approach to bring back normalcy amid the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/covid-19-lockdown-over-500-migrants-return-to-rajasthan-from-west-bengal/story-PFGBE73tddFXhn21YQWqHO.html

In some places in the state, people had even ‘reserved’ their spot since Sunday night by leaving slippers, bags and other personal items to represent them. Some celebrated the re-opening of liquor stores by conducting puja – with burning camphor and lighting incense sticks – while in Belgaum reports have come in of crackers being burst.Karnataka, which had shut pubs, malls, restaurants, liquor stores and anyplace else where a drink could be had after the countrywide shutdown was announced, had decided to re-open shops from Monday after heavy lobbying by excise minister H Nagesh with chief minister BS Yediyurappa and the cabinet. Nagesh has said that the state has lost Rs 3000 crore till now due to the ban on liquor sales. Karnataka has an annual target of Rs 22,700 crore for liquor sales. While pubs, restaurants and liquor stores inside malls and multiplexes are still closed, about 4500 standalone liquor stores were re-opened. These are primarily state-owned Mysore Sales International Ltd (MSIL) as well as MRP stores.The move to open up large parts of the state back to business meant that traffic jams, which were not reported for the last month, were witnessed again across the state. Even in Bengaluru, which is a red zone district, there were traffic jams across the city. The move to open up the state also came in for criticism by Janata Dal (Secular) president HK Kumaraswamy.HD Kumaraswamy said the move was premature and that the state government seems to have taken the decision to shore up its revenues rather than safeguard the health of citizens. He also criticised the move to send back migrants, saying it would result in labour shortage and unavailability.Meanwhile, Karnataka which had allowed migrants to travel free of cost on its state-run Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) buses till Wednesday said it would extend this facility till Friday. On Sunday alone 951 KSRTC buses ferried more than 30,000 people to various destinations. All these migrants are also provided free food and water for the journey, a note from the state government said. Four trains—two to Bihar and one each to Ranchi in Jharkhand and Bhubaneshwar in Odisha—carrying 4800 people also left the state.In the last 12 hours, Karnataka also registered 28 new positive cases of Covid-19 taking the cumulative tally to 642, which includes 26 deaths and 304 discharges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/liquor-stores-see-long-queues-as-they-re-open-after-40-days-in-karnataka/story-l7hVASEuUKdZXKeslfUsgM.html

04-05-2020||Delhi||Unlock Delhi, we’re ready: Arvind Kejriwal||Delhi’s chief minister Arvind Kejriwal asked the Centre on Sunday to lift the lockdown in the Capital, underlining that both the government and citizens will have to learn to live with the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), and that the lockdown – while necessarily – was now causing a grave economic crisis. Kejriwal acknowledged that this may lead to an increase in cases, but said that Delhi’s infrastructure was prepared to deal with it.Outlining the relaxations in the city from Monday, as per central guidelines, the Delhi CM said the state government told the Centre that barring the 97 containment zones in the city, which should remain sealed, the rest of the city should be declared a “green zone”. This was necessary to ease the suffering of the people, as well as ensure the economy got back on its feet, which was necessary for the government itself to function, Kejriwal said.All of Delhi is currently a “red zone” – where restrictions on activities are the most severe. The decision to relax the classification of an administrative jurisdiction rests with the Centre.“Imposing the lockdown was very important. If the Centre had not done so on March 24, there would have been a frightening situation in the country because at that point, we were not ready to deal with the coronavirus disease. We did not have personal protective equipment kits, we did not have testing kits, hospitals were not ready, people were not aware of the idea of social distancing,” Kejriwal said. He emphasised that Delhi had followed all the central guidelines – “which were good, very good” – but it was now time to lift the lockdown.The CM said that the lockdown had created two major difficulties. The first was that people were facing enormous hardship. “People are losing livelihoods. Traders can’t open their shops. There is no industrial activity. More jobs are being lost. Many people will leave Delhi soon.”This has shaken the entire economic architecture, which, in turn, caused the second crisis. “Since the economy is closed, the government is not getting any revenues. In April, every year, the government used to receive ~3,500 crore in revenues. Last month, we got ~300 crore. How will we pay salaries? How will we run the government?”Kejriwal said it was important to understand that Covid-19 is now here to stay. “We will not see a situation now where there are no cases. This is now impossible.” The idea of the lockdown was to prepare, and Delhi, he said, had done so optimally. “We have made adequate arrangements. We have enough testing kits. We have hospitals.”Delhi currently has close to 3,000 beds reserved for Covid-19 patients in several state and central government hospitals, and an additional 420 paid beds in private hospitals, according to thehealth department.Kejriwal said last month that the government has a plan to gradually scale the requirement of beds -- in hospitals, hotels and guest houses -- to 30,000 depending on the rise in cases.There are 306 ventilators in public hospitals in the city and about 800 more in private, Delhi government officials said.The Capital also has adequate stock of personal protective equipment (PPEs), with around 300,000 lakh PPE kits being delivered piecemeal and at least 15,000 kits received from the Centre, government officials said.In this backdrop – where Covid-19 could not be eradicated and the city infrastructure was adequate – Delhi, the CM said, had asked the Centre to lift the lockdown. “We have advised the Centre that while 97 containment zones in the city should be entirely sealed, the rest of the city should be declared a green zone. All markets should be open. One way is to make it odd-even, with alternate shops opening every day. But it is time to open Delhi.”While a senior government functionary said the Union home ministry will continue to work together with states, another official said the guidelines are for all states/UTs to follow. The developments come days after the Centre said in its order, released on Friday, that states can enforce stricter rules but not dilute them.Delhi reported 427 new cases on Sunday, taking its total tally to 4,549 including 64 deaths.Lifting the lockdown, Kejriwal acknowledged, will lead to a possible increase in cases. “We are hopeful that Delhi’s economy will open soon. When this happens, there will be an increase in cases. But we are prepared to deal with it.”“If you talk about the number of hospitals and beds for Covid-19 patients, yes, there are more now than there were before. But the ground reality is that there are gaps – non-Covid patients are not getting admissions, many doctors getting infected. The quality of care provided at government hospitals also has to improve. The government needs to address these issues before opening up lockdown,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung Hospital.Kejriwal also outlined the government’s broad public health strategy at the moment. “Our first priority is to minimise deaths due to the disease; we have been successful in this. The second is to minimise the spread of the disease. That is why we are testing in large numbers now, to be able to the track the infected and treat them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/unlock-delhi-we-re-ready-arvind-kejriwal/story-5yQwayQAFZvvCf3xPJSfwK.html

Everyone coming in to be screened as per protocols,” she wrote on Twitter.While there were no press briefings on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, opposition leaders have started contacting other states to arrange for the return of the workers.“...We are afraid the Bengal government’s delay in arranging for the return of the migrant workers would worsen their plight,” said Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, the leader of Congress in Lok Sabha and Bengal MP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/two-trains-to-bring-back-migrants-to-west-bengal-cm/story-VssllnRnQrmVz0ubjlATgK.html

04-05-2020||Mumbai||Decision to set up IFSC HQ in Guj erroneous: Sharad Pawar slams Centre||In a letter to Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi on Sunday, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar has slammed the central government’s decision to set up the headquarters of the International Finance Services Centre (IFSC) in Gandhinagar instead of Mumbai and termed the establishment of the centre in Gujarat’s capital as “egregious, erroneous and unwarranted.”In the scathing letter, a picture of which he had tweeted on Sunday, the veteran politician wrote, “It [the decision] will also be perceived as a move to shift financial institutions and business houses away from Maharashtra and will create unnecessary political disturbances. It will not only cause financial damage to the country but also bring international discredit to it by undermining the importance of Mumbai.”The former Union minister also said that the central government receives government securities (G-sec) worth ₹5.95 lakh crore from Maharashtra against Gujarat’s contribution of ₹1.40 lakh crore. He also said that Mumbai has been recognised among the world’s top 10 centres of commerce in terms of global financial flow, generating 6.16% of India’s gross domestic product (GDP) and accounting for 25% of industrial output and 70% of capital transactions to India economy. “If you see the general psyche of all business communities, bankers and other financial institutions, Mumbai is their natural choice for setting up such a unified authority. The Central government’s decision will be taken as an act of undermining the strategic importance of Mumbai that boasts as the nation’s financial capital,” Pawar wrote. “Even the institutions across the world will be taken a back with this shocking decision,” he added.The former Maharashtra chief minister has also said that the PM must consider establishing IFSC in India’s financial capital. “I expect Hon @PMOIndia to take a rational, judicious decision keeping aside the state politics and consider it as an issue of utmost national importance,” Pawar had tweeted.The NCP chief’s reaction has come a day after former Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said that it was the then Congress-NCP government which is to be blamed for the move, as it did not consider the option when it first came up in 2007. Fadnavis also claimed that the previous state government, during his tenure, had submitted a proposal to the Centre to allow the functioning of two IFSCs in the country – in Mumbai and Gujarat – and added that it was still under consideration.The Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) units in Mumbai too have indulged in a war of words over the Centre’s decision. Reacting to the NCP chief’s scathing letter, BJP legislator Ashish Shelar said that it is still possible to establish an IFSC in Mumbai.“Those criticising [the Centre] today, what did you do when you were in power between 2007 and 2014?” Shelar tweeted pointing at the then Congress-NCP government in Maharashtra.He further said, “You are in power today, start the process. Don’t just criticise.”Congress spokesperson, Sachin Sawant, however, said that the decision to establish IFSC lies with the Central government. “Two committee reports during the tenure of UPA [United Progressive Alliance] government suggested that IFSC must be established in Mumbai. There is no report, which talks of Gandhinagar. The decision to establish IFSC was taken by the BJP government in 2015, within a year they came into power at the Centre.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/decision-to-set-up-ifsc-hq-in-guj-erroneous-sharad-pawar-slams-centre/story-srlbm4aarjwYK2VMsXg0jI.html

The sea breeze set in early allowing minimal pollutant concentration to disperse leading to ‘good’ air quality,” said Gufran Beig, director, SAFAR. “Our models are showing that AQI will remain within the ‘good’ and ‘satisfactory’ category for Mumbai until the lockdown is called off.” The concentration of PM10 (larger coarser particles) was 43 μg/m³ against the national safe standard of 100 μg/m³ for 24 hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pm2-5-in-mumbai-was-lower-than-who-s-safe-limit-during-lockdown/story-UlCWdw6VIkEkhIbN66PErM.html
04-05-2020||Chandigarh||No odd-even rule for vehicles, shop timings curtailed in Chandigarh as curfew lifted||Modifying some of the relaxations and restrictions announced on Saturday, the Chandigarh administration on Sunday decided not to implement the odd-even formula for vehicles while reducing the market timings to eight hours from 12 hours.The lockdown will continue for another two weeks while the curfew imposed in the city on March 24 will be lifted from Monday.The development comes after traders and resident bodies questioned the move, with even social media users pitching in. In the detailed order issued on Sunday, the administration stated that all shops dealing in non-essential goods in internal sector markets (neighbourhood shops) will remain open from 10am to 6pm on odd-even basis. It means, shops with numbers ending with even digit will be open on even-numbered dates and those with odd on odd-numbered dates. In the Saturday order, the timings were fixed as 7am to 7pm, corresponding with the window given for the movement of people.Shops selling essential goods, such as groceries, milk, vegetables and medicines, will remain open on all days. However, the relaxations don’t cover hotels, restaurants, discotheques, salons, barber shops, spa centres, gyms and apni mandis, and these will remain shut.Meanwhile, shops selling liquor, paan, gutka and tobacco will have to ensure minimum six-foot distance between customers, and also ensure that not more than five of them are present at one time in the shop. Also, only sale of liquor is allowed and taverns will remain closed.MALLS, CONGESTED AND MAIN MARKETS TO REMAIN SHUTIn view of need for social distancing, all congested markets, such as Patel Market in Sector 15, Gandhi Market in Sector 18, Sadar Bazar and Palika Bazar in Sector 19, Shastri Market in Sector 22, Janata Market in Sector 27, Krishna Market in Sector 41 and Rehri Market in Sector 46, will remain closed. Significantly, some of the market associations had declared on Sunday that they would keep their establishments closed on their own if there were no instructions from the administration.Shops in Sector 17, malls and market complexes such, as Elante Mall, DLF Mall, and shops located on sector dividing roads, such as Madhya Marg and Dakshin Marg, will also remain closed. Criticising the administrations decision on the Sector 17 market, Chandigarh Business Council president Neeraj Bajaj said: “Sector 17 has spacious shops with ample parking and verandahs. Social distancing could have been easily observed here. In fact, Sector 17 should have been the first market to open to test whether social distancing will work in the city post curfew.”Chandigarh Beopar Mandal chairman Charanjiv Singh said: “Opening shops for more than five hours doesn’t make sense. We shopkeepers feel exposed dealing with public for such a long time.”MOVEMENT PROHIBITED BETWEEN 7PM AND 7AMAll non-essential activities and people movement will remain strictly prohibited between 7 pm and 7am and residents will have to stay indoors as per the prohibitory orders issued by the district magistrate.However, reversing the odd-even rule, all vehicles can ply between 7am and 7pm. Four-wheelers can have maximum two passengers besides the driver while a two-wheeler cannot have a pillion rider.UT adviser Manoj Kumar Parida said: “We realised that odd-even rule for vehicles will be difficult for people when there is no public transport. Also, carpooling will promote infection, though it will prevent pollution.” Also, persons above 65 years of age, those with co-morbidities, pregnant women and children below the age of 10 years have to stay at home at all times, except for meeting essential requirements and for health purposes, as per the national directives.MANDATORY MASKS, RESTRICTED GATHERINGSWearing of face cover (mask) is also compulsory in public places as well as work places, as per the order issued on Sunday. Work places have to keep adequate stock of such face covers. Meanwhile, no organisation or manager of public place can allow gathering of five or more people. Marriages related gatherings have to ensure social distancing, and the maximum number of guests allowed can not be more than 50. Funeral rites related gatherings too have to ensure social distancing and the maximum numbers allowed is 20.RESIDENT BODIES REMAIN DIVIDEDThe administration had on Saturday decided to lift the curfew while restricting the containment zones to six affected pockets, including parts of hotspots Bapu Dham Colony and Sector 30, where no relaxations are to be granted.Residents remained divided over both the Saturday and Sunday orders. Federation of Sector Welfare Associations Chandigarh (FOSWAC) chairman Baljinder Singh Bittu said: “The administration has taken a bold decision and we stand behind it. Life cannot stop just because of Covid-19 and sooner or later we will have to go back to our previous routines.”However, Chandigarh Residents Association Welfare Federation (CRAWFED) chairman Hitesh Puri felt the relaxation is still too long. “The move should have been done in a phased manner. Eight-hour relaxation is too long; the market hours should be reduced to six as fresh cases are still being reported in Chandigarh.”OTHER REVISED, NEW DECISIONSAll government offices will be opened on May 4, but no public dealing will take place till May 11. Even Sampark Centres will open from May 11.Interstate travel will be allowed for permitted activities only. Passes issued by the deputy commissioners of Mohali and Panchkula will be honoured, though thermal scanning will be done at entry points.Traders residing in Mohali and Panchkula but having shops in Chandigarh will require passes from the respective deputy commissioners, clarified UT principal secretary, home, Arun Gupta.KHER’S ADVICE GOES UNHEEDEDAdvocating for continuation of strict restrictions in the city, MP Kirron Kher had voiced strong reservations over the administration’s decision to allow opening up of markets, businesses and workplaces. “I shared my concerns with the UT officials on Saturday over allowing major relaxations at time when the cases are increasing in the city. Only essential services and shops should be allowed to be open now.” However, the administration made no major change in its decision despite this advice. Commenting on it, Parida said: “As an MP, she has every right to give her views. All should respect her opinion. The administrator has taken the decision after taking views of all stakeholders and experts, keeping in view the home ministry’s directions.”ENJOY THE CONFUSION, SAYS PARIDAAfter the Saturday order, UT adviser Manoj Parida took to Twitter, responding 700 queries, to bring clarity on various decisions, especially the odd-even rule, but ended up suggesting: “Enjoy the confusion”. Pointing out the formula’s impracticality, a Twitter user asked Parida that if his shop number is odd and his vehicle number is even, how would he go to his shop? Parida suggested he opens his shop every second day, assuming he sold essential goods. When another user pointed out that shops in Chandigarh villages do not have numbers, Parida suggested he should “enjoy the confusion”. Finally, Parida assured everyone that the decisions will be reconsidered before implementation, as was done on Sunday evening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/no-odd-even-rule-for-vehicles-shop-timings-curtailed-in-chandigarh-as-curfew-lifted/story-2i2jSJUinHR0yab4FRXjiP.html
04-05-2020||City||Doctors create awareness on Covid-19 among Mumbra patients||As fear of Covid-19 outbreak grips densely-populated Mumbra, general practitioners in the locality are facing dual challenges – keeping themselves safe from the virus and convincing patients to adhere to the norms of social distancing. “We have to take a lot of precautions because safety of all other patients and doctors can be at risk if a patient turns out to be Covid-19 positive. For patients with symptoms similar to Covid-19, hold phone conversations to assess the severity of the situation. Depending on the pattern and severity of symptoms, we decide if they visit the clinic ,” said Dr. Alfarooq Raut, a general practitioner in Mumbra. A few days ago, two of Raut’s patients tested positive for the virus. “Thankfully I had spoken to them over the phone,” he added. Until Satuday, there were 372 total coronavirus cases in all of Thane Municipal Corporation’s (TMC) jurisdiction, 55 were from Mumbra. On April 2, Mumbra had only had two cases. Non-adherence to social distancing norms by many patients visiting their clinics is a bigger cause of worry for doctors than direct risks associated in checking patients.“I had a patient with travel history who failed to isolate. I had to call the police to ensure he complied. As doctors who are working in such a situation, we have to also take care of all these allied responsibilities,” said Dr. Moinuddin Rawoot, president of the Medical Practitioners’ Association Mumbra-Kausa, which has nearly 350 doctors under its ambit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/doctors-create-awareness-on-covid-19-among-mumbra-patients/story-gZnTajZ1Tqn9cVar5kquVP.html
04-05-2020||Lucknow||Cheers! After 6 weeks, liquor shops to open from today||After 42 days of closure, standalone liquor shops would begin sale of the heady brew from Monday under police watch between 10 am and 7 pm across Uttar Pradesh. The sale timings have been reduced by three hours and vends in hotspots or containment zones would remain closed, officials confirmed. The decision to open the shops was taken by the Uttar Pradesh government on Sunday, a day before lockdown 3.0 begins with some relaxations across specified zones. Beer joints and regular bars across the state would remain closed as the excise department officials said they were trying to work out a method to ensure minimum ‘contact’ sales. Principal secretary, excise, Sanjay R Bhoosreddy, while confirming the decision to open standalone liquor shops, said the excise department would release a detailed guideline on the sale of liquor that would be done in police presence to avoid overcrowding.“Excise department people would also be present at all liquor shops during the sale,” he said, adding that all liquor shops would not have more than five people at any point in time.The state government is staring at a loss in excess of Rs 32,000 million (Rs 3,200 crore) due to the extended closure of liquor vends.Meanwhile, all the vends whose country-made wholesale liquor licence had expired on March 31 but were unable to clear their stock due to lockdown that was enforced since March 22, would be given 7 days time to clear their stock.Also, due to the lockdown, the state government has decided to relax the binding on liquor sellers to lift complete mimimum guarantee quota (MGQ) of country-made liquor for March 2020. The department has also relaxed the MGQ clause for April as the liquor sellers had approached the excise department saying that due to lockdown there was no way they could fulfil the excise policy clause of picking a certain pre-fixed quota of countrymade liquor from the government.“We have also relaxed the binding on such liquor shops selling Indian Made Foreign Liquor and beer to generate 20 per cent or higher sale revenue in 2019-20 as compared to the revenue earned in corresponding period in 2018-19,” Bhoosreddy said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/cheers-after-6-weeks-liquor-shops-to-open-from-today/story-8hnITOGwsTSOFwfPS4R6HO.html
04-05-2020||Delhi||Number of Covid +ve healthcare workers in north Delhi hospitals doubles to 13||The number of healthcare workers falling victim to Covid-19 at North Delhi Municipal Corporation’s three biggest hospitals — Hindu Rao in Malka Ganj, Kasturba in Daryaganj and the Rajan Babu TB Hospital in Kingsway Camp — more than doubled to 13 on Sunday from six a day before.The fresh cases included three women doctors from the gynaecology department of Kasturba Hospital. A 25-year-old postgraduate student of the department of the hospital had tested positive for the virus last Wednesday. Later, another doctor had tested Covid positive on Saturday, taking the number of doctors infected by the virus to five.There were allegations that the 25-year-old student had complained of high fever and body ache, but the authorities only asked her to go on leave and did not get her tested. Meanwhile, other doctors were frequently visiting her room.In Hindu Rao Hospital, three more doctors tested positive for Covid on Sunday afterone of their colleague from the ophthalmology department was found Covid positive a day earlier. The chain of transmission here had begun with a nurse testing positive for the highly infectious disease on April 25.Thereafter, 76 healthcare workers, who came in contact with the nurse, were tested and another nurse, who worked closely with the first victim, was found positive on Thursday. In total, six doctors and nurses are confirmed to have contracted the infection at this hospital.Meanwhile, a laboratory technician at Hindu Rao also said he had tested positive on Saturday, most likely getting the virus from his Covid positive wife, a nurse at Fortis Hospital, Shalimar Bagh.In the third north corporation hospital, Rajan Babu TB Hospital, a ward helper was found Covid positive last Tuesday. “Meanwhile, three other non-employees at the Hindu Rao Hospital have also tested positive for the diseases on Sunday. These are spouses of our Covid-positive staffers and one patient,” a senior north corporation officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/number-of-covid-ve-healthcare-workers-in-north-delhi-hospitals-doubles-to-13/story-MEekS1wn0NfkYusMNFvQoJ.html
04-05-2020||Delhi||With 427 new cases, Capital records biggest single-day spike||With 427 new cases, Delhi on Sunday witnessed the highest single day spike in Covid-19 cases – taking the cumulative total of positive cases diagnosed so far to 4,549, said the health bulletin shared by the government.Delhi, on Sunday, also recorded recovery of 106 Covid-19 patients and no fresh death, which brings down the total number of active cases to 3,123. The total number of deaths stays 64, the government data said.On Saturday, Delhi had recorded 384 fresh Covid-19 cases which happens to be the second highest single day spike for the Capital now.Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had earlier attributed the high number of cases in Delhi to scaled up testing being done in the in the city which, according to the government, stands somewhere around 2600 people per million population.On Sunday, health minister Satyendar Jain said, “Delhi has so far tested more than 58,000 people… Delay in arrival of test results at times contribute to bulk numbers on a single day. For a better picture, one should look at the doubling rate. Delhi currently has a doubling rate of 11.5 compared to around 4 recorded one month ago.”Doubling rate is an assessment used to represent the time it takes for the number of Covid-19 cases to double within a given geographic area. Districts in Delhi does the assessment in every seven days, senior officials in the health department said. Bengali Market to be de-sealed The Delhi government on Sunday also scaled down containment efforts in New Delhi’s Bengali Market and a lane in Kailash Hiils neighbourhood in South-East Delhi, bringing down the total number of containment zones to 94 in the city.The popular Bengali Market, which was the first and only Covid-19 containment zone in Lutyens’ Delhi, will be de-sealed from Monday. An order to scale down the containment measures in the popular market and surrounding areas was taken on Sunday after no Covid-19 case was reported for 28 days.The same protocol applies to the other sealed area too.In an order issued by District Magistrate Tanvi Garg on Sunday, the authorities were asked to scale down the measures, though lockdown provisions will continue to be in force.The upscale neighbourhood made its way to the list after a surveillance team of the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) found 35 workers of a famous pastry shop living under “unhygienic conditions” violating social-distancing norms. Two workers who had fever-like symptoms (common in Covid-19 patients) will undergo tests.The surveillance was conducted after three persons were found positive for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) from the neighbourhood.YK Anand, president of Babar road RWA said, “It is a huge relief. Though we were provided all services at home, it is a good thing that our area has not reported any new cases.” District magistrate (southeast Delhi) Harleen Kaur did not respond to phone calls and messages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/with-427-new-cases-capital-records-biggest-single-day-spike/story-uTZMj5Si9UHOtolP87xfaI.html
04-05-2020||Delhi||Rules for movement of stranded persons issued by Delhi government||The Delhi government on Sunday issued a standard operating procedure (SOP) for the movement of stranded migrant workers, tourists, pilgrims and students in adherence to the central government’s orders. The SOP directed government officials and the police to join hands to compile a database of the numbers of those stranded, so they could be sent back to their home states, and “encourage” them to download the Arogya Setu mobile application.The SOP document, which HT has seen, stated that the additional district magistrates and additional district commissioners of police “shall register such stranded persons” and prepare the database. An app has also been developed for this purpose, which will be handled by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s advisor Gopal Mohan, and the CEO of the Delhi Urban Shelter Housing Board Vikas Anand, among others.The resident commissioners of various states have been asked to help find such stranded persons. People will be sent back on both buses and trains.The SOP, issued Sunday by chief secretary Vijay Dev, authorised the district magistrates of the city to supervise the preparation of a “comprehensive database” of people stranded in Delhi because of the lockdown, which has now been extended to May 17.The SOP said those who wish to travel on their own would get transit passes from the district magistrates. “While leaving the NCT, such persons may be encouraged to use Aarogya Setu App through which their health status can be monitored and tracked,” it said.While several other states have started the process of sending back stranded migrant workers and students in batches, Delhi is still in its counting phase. Thousands of stranded migrants have now taken shelter in various shelter homes and government schools-turned-shelters arranged by the government. Meanwhile, the Delhi government has brought back about 500 engineering aspirants from the city who were stranded in Rajasthan’s Kota—a major private coaching hub for engineering entrance exams.The SOP also stressed on medically screening every individual and allowing only those found asymptomatic to return. It said that the number of buses and trains required will be decided by Delhi government officials and nodal officers appointed by other states. The secretary of the social welfare department PK Gupta has been appointed as the state nodal officer in Delhi’s case.“Buses shall be used for transport of groups of persons. The buses will be sanitized and shall follow safe social distancing norms in seating. Commissioner Transport, MD of Delhi Transport Corporation and MD of Delhi Tourism and Transportation Development Corporation shall coordinate with state nodal officers and provide buses for the movement of the stranded persons from their respective places (mostly shelter homes) to the inter-state bus terminals/locations specified at the inter-state borders [sic],” the SOP said.It further said: “Movement of migrant workers, pilgrims, tourists, students and other persons is also allowed by special trains to be operated by Ministry of Railways. Railways will designate nodal officers for coordinating with states/UTs for their movement. Railways will also issue detailed guidelines for sale of ticket [sic].”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/rules-for-movement-of-stranded-persons-issued-by-delhi-government/story-27zWOf5DW7aoiT7isfDR2M.html
04-05-2020||Delhi||Two more hospitals may join Covid fight soon; private cabs to act as ambulances||As the Covid-19 pandemic rages in the city, Delhi government on Sunday said it is ready to start operations at two — of its three — government hospitals that have been under construction since the first tenure of the AAP government .The government on Sunday appointed medical directors for its two hospitals in Dwarka and Ambedkar Nagar. The hospitals together will add over 1,800 beds to the existing 11,770 beds in Delhi government-run hospitals.“This is part of the routine ongoing work to open up more hospitals. Work will begin to open these hospitals up soon. However, the hospital in Burari (whose construction is also almost finished) will take a while to open as the government is still deciding whether it will be on a PPP model or not,” said a senior official from Delhi’s health department.The services of these hospitals might be included for Covid-19, if need be.“Currently, there are two designated hospitals under Delhi government with 2,500 beds to take care of Covid-19 patients. However, if there is need for more beds, then the new hospitals might also pitch in as it would be easier to keep the people with viral infection in isolation at the new facilities. There will be no intermixing with non-Covid-19 patients,” according to the official.Earlier, the Delhi government had allocated Covid-19 areas in five designated hospitals. However, fearing spread of infection, only two hospitals were completely earmarked for dealing with Covid-19 cases exclusively. CAB AMBULANCESAround 200 taxis of an app-based cab-aggregator service will be available across the city to ferry people in need of non-Covid-19 medical care, during the lockdown. Only non-critical patients will be transported in these taxis.Patients across the city right now are solely dependent on ambulance service for transportation during medical emergencies, with no public transport available due to the lockdown.“It is decided to continue the use of these vehicles as ambulance service to carry non-Covid, non-critical patients to and from hospitals in coordination with CATS Ambulance helpline 102,” the government order read.The cabs will be allocated through the Centralised Accident and Trauma Services (CATS) Ambulance service at the helpline number — 102. The Delhi government has also issued four other cell-phone numbers to reach CATS call centre -- 7291000071, 7291000078, 7291000093, 7291000094.The taxis are being provided to the Delhi government free of charge by the aggregator service.The government run CATS service has around 151 ambulances for emergencies across the city, of which about 60 are deputed for transporting Covid-19 positive or suspected cases. The Delhi government had launched the ‘Home to Hospital Care Scheme’ in 2015 to provide free ambulance service for all medical emergencies. Earlier, the service was restricted to accidents and deliveries.On Saturday, at least 15 people working in the modern control room of CATS services in Laxmi Nagar had tested positive for Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/two-more-hospitals-may-join-covid-fight-soon-private-cabs-to-act-as-ambulances/story-qomIm3ctQk58tbttivCpgL.html

Maj Sood was among the five security personnel who were killed in an encounter with militants in Jammu Kashmir’s Handwara on Sunday. His father Brigadier Chandrakant Sood (retd) shifted from Gurugram here along with wife eight months ago. He lives in a rented accommodation in Amravati Enclave where their new house is under construction. Major Anuj’s wife is working in a private company in Pune.“He has made a supreme sacrifice for saving lives of others. And that’s what he was trained for. I feel a little sad for his wife as he had to move for operations after just three-four months of his marriage in 2017,” his father said.Meanwhile, Haryana assembly speaker and Panchkula MLA Gian Chand Gupta also visited their house to condole express his condolences. The mortal remains of the deceased will reach Panchkula by Monday.Major Sood was born on December 17, 1989 in Bangalore where his father was posted at that time. After his school education, he got admission into the National Defence Academy (NDA), Pune, in 2012.Major Anuj’s sister Harshita is also serving as a Captain in the army. She is a national-level shooter and is currently undergoing training at the Army Marksmanship Unit at Mhow, Indore. His elder sister lives in Australia while mother Suman is working as a principal in a government school in Yamunanagar.Alma mater remembers beloved ‘Fauji’Major Sood, who studied at Punjab Public School (PPS) from 2006 to 2008, Nabha, was nicknamed as ‘Fauji’ in the school. PPS headmaster Dr Jagpreet Singh said, “The news of Major Sood came as major blow to Nabhaites.” The teachers and his schoolmates fondly remembered their beloved ‘Fauji’ as a brilliant student, excellent sportsman and a soldier to the core who would stand out in every field. His house master Russeljit Singh Khattra said, “Anuj was a fine orator and missed no extracurricular opportunity.”“Fauji and some other students, including me, used to run away after ringing door bells of our headmaster, bursar and another teacher,” said Raghav his former classmate. His father Brigadier Sood was also a PPS alumnus of 1976 batch.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/handwara-encounter-proud-of-my-son-s-sacrifice-says-major-sood-s-father/story-ayt91hIW5wGTnqpUHVP4NM.html

There is no age limit. It will not cover those not attending duties, and if death from Covid cannot be ascertained or attributed to duty.”The Delhi Government had earlier declared ₹1 crore compensation to all “Covid warriors”, including doctor, nurse, paramedical staff, security/sanitation staff or any other government officer including police officer, who dies from the disease. The South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) offered ₹10 lakh in the same context.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/15-lakh-compensation-for-employees-dying-of-covid-new-delhi-municipal-council/story-eIPXYfqLC8GL0pduCUlzNI.html
04-05-2020||Delhi||Delhi: Man deposits cheque signed by Covid patient, bank panics||Staffers at the State Bank of India’s (SBI) Model Town branch panicked on Friday when a 51-year-old man deposited a cheque that was issued and signed by his friend’s brother, who tested positive for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and is quarantined at home, the police said. The bank informed the police and reportedly told them that many staff members had touched the cheque.Deputy commissioner of police (northwest) Vijayanta Arya said that a case under Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the Indian Penal Code has been registered for the violation of home-quarantine rules. The first information report (FIR) was filed on the complaint of the bank’s branch manager. HT has a copy of the FIRIn her complaint, the branch manager also mentioned that the man who wrote the cheque had also visited the bank earlier in the week. He was “quite abusive” and “created a ruckus”, the manager alleged in the complaint.The manager refused to comment on the matter when she was contacted on the phone.“A police team visited his home in Model Town and found that a home-quarantine notice was pasted outside his house and he was a Covid-positive patient,” DCP Arya said.Senior police officers said that the bank’s staffers were apprehensive that the man may have been infected at the time he visited the bank. A contact-tracing procedure has been initiated to ascertain how many people the man came in contact with while being infected with the virus, a police officer said.“I have no information on this particular case, but I’ll send the SDM of Model Town to visit the quarantined house and see how a Covid-positive man managed to leave his house,” Deepak Shinde, district magistrate (north), said.A police officer associated with the case said that on Friday, the 51-year-old man deposited the cheque, without informing the bank staffers that it was signed and issued by a person who was infected with the coronavirus disease.HT contacted the 51-year-old man to know if he was aware that the person whose cheque he had collected was infected with the virus. The man said, “I knew he was tested positive for the coronavirus disease but received the cheque from his brother who is my friend. I did it in good faith.” He refused to comment further, saying that there was nothing to tell as a case has already been registered.According to the officer, the contact-tracing procedure is necessary to know if the 51-year-old man was in physical contact with the infected person while receiving the cheque or had been meeting him or his family members earlier as well.“We’ve geo-fenced the infected man’s cellphone. We will examine his cellphone location to ascertain his movements. The location of other cellphones around his house will help us find out who all have visited the area. All such persons will be questioned,” the officer added.The Centre’s last week’s guidelines allowed mild or pre-symptomatic coronavirus cases to be home-quarantined, provided he or she lives in a place that allows strict isolation without having to intermingle with the rest of the family and a caregiver is present 24x7 and is in direct touch with a nearby Covid-19 hospital. Under the guidelines, the patient has to sign an undertaking of strict compliance with the dos and don’ts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-man-deposits-cheque-signed-by-covid-patient-bank-panics/story-Abm2SzkW4FPU8vSJjhZO5M.html
04-05-2020||Delhi||Delhi: 50 can gather for a wedding, 20 for a funeral||Maximum 50 people would be allowed at wedding functions and not more than 20 people could attend a funeral, as per a latest order which lists the relaxations prescribed by the Centre for the ‘red zone’ in the national capital during the ongoing national lockdown.“Not more than 50 people are allowed at wedding functions and not more than 20 at last rites of a deceased person,” said Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal during a video conference. Strict restrictions had been in place in the national capital as part of the measures to contain the spread of Covid-19. The latest order has come in as the Centre announced the extension of the national lockdown till May 17. Earlier, the lockdown had been announced till May 3. Besides gatherings standalone shops in neighbourhoods and those selling essential commodities in shopping complexes will continue to remain open in the national capital from Monday, the Delhi government order said on Sunday. However, malls and market complexes will remain closed, the order clarified. The Delhi government in an earlier order, issued on April 15, had allowed standalone shops in neighbourhoods to reopen but ensure that social distancing is followed. Traders on Sunday said that even though there was no change in the new order regarding the opening of shops, there is still no clarity on the definition of “standalone shops” and what items are allowed to be sold during this extended lockdown.They also said that not many such shops, except for grocery stores, reopened April 15.Praveen Khandelwal, general secretary, the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), while welcoming the government’s order, said that to implement this well, the authorities must define what constitutes neighbourhood shops and standalone shops and what are the items that these shops can sell.“There has been a lot of confusion since the initial order was issued on April 15 and not many owners have opened shop since. It also needs to be clarified whether curfew passes are required for the opening of such shops, as people might face harassment from enforcing authorities. There should be clear and exhaustive guidelines regarding the rules for such shops to open so that traders feel confident to resume their businesses,” Khandelwal said.Brijesh Goyal, the convener of the Chamber of Trade and Industry, said that the traders are in support of Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s recommendation of allowing shops to open on “odd-even” days.“Just like the CM suggested, we are of the opinion that slowly shops should be allowed to reopen. Shops could be allowed to open on alternative days, or for some time in the day, but there should be some leniency now. Traders are facing huge losses,” Goyal said.The trader associations in popular markets in Delhi said that the lockdown is hitting business, but they support the government’s decision to not allow market places to reopen yet.“We had decided that even if the government allows markets to reopen, we will keep our shops closed. Sarojini Nagar is known for the crowd it attracts, and if shops are reopened, it will be difficult to control the crowd. It will be a health hazard for the shoppers as well as shop owners and workers,” Ashok Randhawa, president of Sarojini Nagar Mini Market Traders’ Association, said. However, not everyone was happy with the extension of this lockdown on their businesses. Suhail Sawhney, a cloth trader in west Delhi’s Rajouri Garden, said that he has already incurred losses worth lakhs of rupees because his shops have remained closed.“We do understand that it is a difficult time but we need to have some window where we can do business. How will we pay our staff and how will we sustain our businesses if we remain closed for over a month like this?” Sawhney said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-50-can-gather-for-a-wedding-20-for-a-funeral/story-y2rs6a3dVF2seUUr8yYzHJ.html
04-05-2020||Chandigarh||Screening a must for all crossing Haryana borders||People stranded in Haryana, including the migrant labourers, will be appropriately screened and examined for Covid- 19 symptoms or influenza-like illness (ILI) characteristics before they are sent back to their home states. Similarly, the states sending people to Haryana will also have to ensure they are screened. “Only those who do not show Covid-19 symptoms or ILI characteristics will be allowed to proceed,” stated the standard operating procedure (SoP) prepared by the state government for both inward and outward movement of stranded people. Movement of persons from containment zones, however, will not be permitted. A webpage on e-disha portal for the registration and documentation for this purpose has been created. People of Haryana residing in other states who want to come back and those living in Haryana willing to move to their parent states should mandatorily get themselves registered at the web portal, said a top official. The portal can be accessed at www.edisha.gov.in/eForms/MigrantServiceSoP for private vehiclesPeople who want to come back to Haryana in their private vehicles will register themselves on the web link and also download the permission form before starting their journey. They will also have to submit this during medical screening at the border checkpoints. The district administrations will do a proper medical screening of such people at the posts. Screening places will have proper arrangements for parking of vehicles, food, drinking water and toilets. If any person shows symptoms of Covid-19 infection or ILI characteristics, he/she will be necessarily put in institutional quarantine. People travelling in their private vehicles will ensure that their vehicles are properly sanitised and social distancing is strictly adhered to,” the SoP stated, adding that on arrival at their destination, asymptomatic persons are advised to remain in home or institutional quarantine for at least 14 days. Nodal officers for co-ordinationHaryana has appointed six nodal officers for coordination with other states.

04-05-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt wants Centre to redefine Covid zones||Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday asked the Union government to reconsider its methodology of categorising red, orange and green zones, at least for Delhi. He recommended that only containment zones in the city be kept as red zones, and further relaxations be allowed in areas outside them. All 11 revenue districts in Delhi are currently listed as red zones by the central government, which essentially means all of them have recorded Covid-19 cases in the last 21 days. Currently, 94 containment zones are spread across these 11 revenue districts in the city – they range from plots and lanes to cluster of neighbourhood blocks. As per the current definition, however, this makes the entire district a red zone. Officials familiar with the matter who asked not to be named said that Delhi could also ask for a ward-level classification, instead of district-level, since Delhi is geographically a small state that should not be treated at par with large states such as Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. There are 272 wards in Delhi.Kejriwal announced that his government will provide all the relaxations within the ambit of the Union government’s order for red zones (in terms of districts) across the country (except containment zones) for the rest of the national lockdown, which has been extended till May 17.But Delhi faces a twin challenge of providing relaxations as per the central guidelines while maintaining a stringent control on the spread of Covid-19 with the city reporting the maximum hike in cases on Sunday when 427 people tested positive for the coronavirus disease.Kejriwal said the relaxations are critical for the state government to jump-start the state economy, which has been badly hit by the continued lockdown. According to government officials, the revenue collection for April was down by around 91.5% compared to the same month last year. The average April revenue of ₹3,500 crore fell to ₹300 crore, said officials.“The whole of Delhi is under red zone and, so far, we have followed all guidelines issued by the centre in the strictest way to contain the spread of coronavirus. But Delhi is now ready for more relaxations,” Kejriwal said in a video briefing.“I have suggested to the central government that containment zones be sealed and categorised as red zones but the rest of Delhi be classified green. If needed, markets use an odd-even rule, so that traders can take turn in opening shops on alternate days based on shop numbers. This can ensure social distancing,” he added, saying that categorising an entire district was is not fair in a place such as Delhi.Till May 17, services such as public transport, para-transit, cab aggregators, schools and colleges, coaching centres, hotels, restaurants, malls, markets, cinema halls, barber shops, salons, sports complexes and gyms, political and social gathering, and religious institutes among others would remain out of bounds for the people, an order issued by the Delhi government said.It, however, allows movement of people from 7 am to 7 pm; plying of private cars (with not more than three occupants) and two-wheelers (with no pillion riders) for activities permitted by the order issued; services of self-employed service providers; limited gathering for marriages (50) and last rites of the dead (20); standalone shops, including those selling alcohol (under L-6 and L-8 categories), in neighbourhoods, residential complexes and anywhere other than malls, shopping complexes and markets; and shops selling essentials.The district administration, however, is still deliberating on ways to implement the relaxations provided under the order, several district magistrates and sub-divisional magistrates told HT.“We may start issuing passes to individuals covered under the extended ambit of relaxations now,” said a government official who asked not to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-govt-wants-centre-to-redefine-covid-zones/story-kBetgi6TXPfrnSBe6Reg1J.html
04-05-2020||Mumbai||65% CEOs anticipate over 40% revenue loss: Survey||The Covid-19 outbreak and the ensuing lockdown is expected to result in revenue loss and job cuts, revealed a survey conducted by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) based on the responses of more than 300 company heads across India.Around 65% CEOs across the country expect revenue to fall by more than 40% in the current quarter (April-June 2020). The survey, ‘CII CEOs Snap Poll on Impact of Covid-19 on Economy and Industry’, was released on Saturday. CII is a non-government business association comprising private and public sector companies. Two-thirds of those surveyed were company heads of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs).The survey revealed that 54% CEOs also anticipate job losses in their sectors post the lockdown. Of this, 45% expect 15-30% job-cuts. Of those surveyed, 44.7% are of the view that it will take more than a year to resume normalcy in the economy, while 34% anticipate their companies to recover in a period of 6-12 months. The only relief from the survey is that 65% of those surveyed have not experienced wage/salary-cut in their firms. However, 48% feel that if a salary-cut is imposed, the tenure will largely remain undecided.Complete shutdown of operations, lack of demand for products, credit crunch, unavailability or constraints in movement of labour, no access to raw materials are some of the main constraints in the operation of businesses, the survey revealed.Taking cognisance of the deteriorating industry expectations, Chandrajit Banerjee, director general of CII, said “While the lockdown was necessary to mitigate the impact of coronavirus on the population, it has had dire implications for economic activity. At this hour, the industry awaits a stimulus package for economic revival and livelihood sustenance besides calibrated exit from lockdown.”In Maharashtra, as on Saturday, 8,220 units are in production with 1.6 lakh workers reporting to sites after the state introduced certain relaxations post April 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/65-ceos-anticipate-over-40-revenue-loss-survey/story-gZCOeXxhKLaeN4j3UZDqgK.html
04-05-2020||Delhi||Delhi’s private firms putting in place mechanisms to keep virus at bay||The Delhi government on Sunday allowed private companies to operate from Monday, albeit with 33% of their staff strength. From testing the health status of employees, rearranging seating plans to ensure social distancing and working out an arrangement to help employees get to work as public transport options remain suspended, private firms say they are coming up with plans to go back to work after curbs are lifted. Soon after the Delhi government released the order on Sunday, many firms said they are now putting their heads together to ensure that normalcy is restored while avoiding any risk of infection, in light of the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease.Prashant Shridhar, a management consultant at a private firm in South Delhi’s Okhla, has been asked to join work from Tuesday after nearly a month of working from home. He said he has spoken to his team head on transportation problems, considering he used to depend on the Delhi Metro for the commute.“I have sent out an e-mail voicing my concerns. I don’t own a car, mainly because there is a metro station less than 200 metres from my house and the rail network connects my workplace as well. I was told by my seniors that they might arrange for an office cab,” said Shridhar.Not just employees, owners and managers are also worried about the added responsibility of keeping the virus at bay. Most of them say they are getting employees’ temperature screened before letting them enter and have made the use of masks mandatory at all times inside the office premises.Dharmendra Singh, the co-founder of Mad4Ad, a private advertising firm with offices in Delhi and Noida, said they were looking forward to resuming work with at least some employees, and that a green signal from the government will help start-ups such as his to stay afloat.“We have regularly been conducting health surveys of our employees to keep a tab on their health status. That is of primary importance to us because a healthy team will keep us going. We are yet to chalk out teams that will start coming to office from next week but the stress is still on conducting digital meetings with clients and online presentations. However, coordination will improve if we have at least some people here at work,” said Singh.In an e-mail response, Tech Tonic, a mobile accessory company in the national Capital, said they have asked employees above the age of 45 to continue working from home.“We welcome the government’s announcement but since people above a certain age are more vulnerable to the coronavirus, we will only call in our younger teammates to office. We are working out a full-fledged plan to start work in the coming days,” the company said in the e-mail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-s-private-firms-putting-in-place-mechanisms-to-keep-virus-at-bay/story-gBvnjFrGz9LMnHu4xKM9BJ.html
04-05-2020||Delhi||Industrial associations in Delhi seek clarity on reopening guidelines||Hours after the Delhi government decided to allow access controlled activities in industrial estates and townships following the Union home ministry’s order, there was confusion among industry owners as to which areas can open.To give more clarity on the order, the government will address representatives of over 80 industrial associations through a video conference on Monday at 3pm, said Brajesh Goyal, convener of the Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP) trade and industry wing in Delhi.“My phone has been flooded with calls and messages enquiring about the implementation of the order. There are some issues that need to be clarified. We will address queries during the conference,” said Goyal.He said so far, going by the order, all industrial areas will be able to start operations, but only if they have mechanisms in place of controlling access to the compound.“In order to resume operations, industrial associations will have to ensure proper mechanisms of controlling the entry and exit of workers, practice norms of social distancing and keeping the area sanitised,” said Goyal.Delhi has 29 notified industrial areas such as Naraina, Kirti Nagar, Okhla, Narela and Bawana, among others.Sunil Chadha, general secretary of Mundka industrial areas, said that unlike other cities, there are no access controlled industrial estates in Delhi. “While industries of essential supplies are operating in Delhi, we want the Delhi government to give clarity on operations in Delhi’s industrial areas,” he said. Industrial associations said the government making arrangements for migrant workers to go back to their respective states will only add to the problem once industrial operations are allowed on full-scale.“Before opening the city’s borders and sending migrants back, the government should allow industrial areas to start so that migrant workers can work so as to earn money,” he said. Also, industrial representatives said there is no clarity on whether all types of industries can open and if they can open full-scale or not. “We are discussing amongst ourselves as to the various interpretations of the order. If we can open units after access control, it will be beneficial to both the owners and the workers, as the economy has suffered,” said Sameer Nayyar, secretary, Delhi Factory Owners’ Federation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/industrial-associations-in-delhi-seek-clarity-on-reopening-guidelines/story-6cORoIKjcfr7Nl9ncFrdcL.html

04-05-2020||Delhi||Stand-alone liquor stores with L6, L8 licences allowed to open||The Delhi government has allowed stand-alone liquor shops in the city to open from Monday, 40 days since they were shut. Also, stand-alone shops selling paan, gutka and tobacco products have been allowed to reopen. These shops are allowed to open from 9am to 6.30pm, said officials.There are around 150 liquor shops that are eligible to open in the city. Establishments, however, have been mandated to maintain strict social distancing, including a prohibition on gatherings of more than five persons at a time at the outlet. “These shops shall ensure a minimum six feet distance among customers and also ensure that not more than five persons are present at one time at the shop,” an order issued by the Delhi government stated.None of the exemptions is applicable for containment zones, said officials.The government also made it clear that the consumption of liquor, paan, gutka, tobacco, etc., in public places will not be allowed.A senior government official said not all liquor vends will be allowed to open. Firstly, liquor shops in markets, shopping complexes or malls are not allowed to open. Secondly, only the stores having L6 and L8 licences will be permitted.L6 licence is for retail vends of Indian liquor/beer, granted only to selected undertakings of the Delhi government, such as DTTDC, DSIDC, DSCSC and DCCWS. L8 licences are for retail vends selling country liquor.“The number of such shops (with L6 and L8 licences) is more than 500, but that number is not important as not all will be eligible to open, because they have to be stand-alone shops. So, we have asked our teams to identify such stand-alone liquor shops across the city,” an official of the excise department said.A senior official said that around 150 liquor shops are eligible to open in the city.Liquor is a major revenue source for Delhi, accounting for ₹5,000 crore annually. Sale of liquor was suspended until till May 3, resulting in a loss of around ₹500 crore, said officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/stand-alone-liquor-stores-with-l6-l8-licences-allowed-to-open/story-oTmhK2mBcsG3xfSx675z5K.html
04-05-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt says construction work can resume if labour is available on site||The Delhi government on Sunday gave its nod to the resumption of construction activities on major infrastructure projects in the city from May 4. The relaxation, however, comes with a rider — construction can be resumed only on those projects for which workers are “available on-site”.The Union government had said that “is-situ” construction on government infrastructure projects could resume from April 20, but the Delhi government continued the ban due to an increasing number of Covid-19 cases in the city-state during the second phase of the nation lockdown, which has now been extended again till May 17 but with some relaxations.Officials of the Public Works Department (PWD) said the Delhi government decision comes as a huge relief because there has been little progress on a majority of infrastructure projects since last November, when a ban on construction to contain pollution levels was imposed. The ban was lifted in February and then reimposed on March 25.PK Vats, PWD’s engineer-in-chief, said the resumption would allow the agency to resume work on the 1.2km tunnel between Mathura Road and the Ring Road, which is part of the Central government’s ITPO Pragati Maidan redevelopment project, Barapulla Phase-3 elevated corridor, flyovers at Shastri Park and Seelampur, and an underpass connecting Benito Juarez Road with San Martin Road.“Construction activities on infrastructure projects were completely shut in the national Capital for over 40 days. Such a move would certainly set the ball rolling. From Monday, we will start the assessment of the availability of labour and inventory of construction materials at the site. Labourers at some project sites are available, so we can start construction activities there in a few days,” Vats said.A senior PWD official, on the condition of anonymity, however, said that a large number of workers have gone to their villages or towns. “Those who had gone to celebrate Holi have not returned from their home towns. The workforce has been reduced further, after the outbreak of the disease,” the official said.But Delhi Metro Rail Corportation (DMRC) officials said they have over 3,500 workers at construction sites in Delhi-NCR.Anuj Dayal, executive director, corporate communications, DMRC, said, “We are prepared to start construction work at its sites if allowed by the government. All government guidelines and directions shall be followed in this regard.”On December 31, 2019, DMRC had started construction work on its Phase-IV network at Haiderpur Badli Mor.Renewable energy projects will also be permitted. In this case, even if workers are not at the site, they will be allowed. This means projects such as installation of solar panels can resume or start in the Capital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-govt-says-construction-work-can-resume-if-labour-is-available-on-site/story-WE9W0r8CSSBYwxb3F4iP4M.html

04-05-2020||Delhi||Delhi: 500 students brought back from Kota||Nearly 500 Delhi students studying in Kota were brought back to the capital on Sunday morning by the Delhi government. They had been stranded in Rajasthan for over a month due to the Covid-19 lockdown. While the government had arranged for 40 buses to bring back 813 students, only 480 were from Delhi, the government said in a statement. The remaining students were “reported to belong to other places”, it added.Following their arrival at ISBT Kashmere Gate in Delhi, the students were screened for Covid-19 at 11 counters, made for different districts, by 11 medical teams comprising a doctor and a paramedic each. “In front of every district-wise counter, 100 circles were drawn at a distance of 6 feet so that social distancing norms can be followed properly during screening,” the government said. The bus station and the premises were sanitised prior to the arrival of the students. Since parents were asked not to come to the bus station, students were given coupons indicating the DTC bus number designated for their specific route. Students boarded the buses, which had been sanitised, following the completion of their medical screening process and reached their homes later in the day.Delhi transport minister Kailash Gahlot asked those who returned to practice self-isolation for two weeks. “I am delighted that we brought back all our students from Kota safely. I would like to request all the students who came back yesterday to stay in home-isolation for 14 days to ensure the safety of their family members,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-500-students-brought-back-from-kota/story-YDsyAcnGV1im4zchoIRgcI.html

The homeopathy consultant, who has a clinic in New Prem Nagar near Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), said many of his regular patients based in different cities fell short of the medication, following which, he started sending them their medicines through parcels.Many residents are also using the services of the postal department that has been categorised as essential to ensure that their loved ones get the medicines they need.Dr Pardeep said his patients, who are continuing their treatment from him, are based in Jalandhar City, Shahkot, Moga, Haryana and Delhi. “Due to the lockdown, they have not been able to come for their routine check-ups. If the people, who have been taking medicines for an ailment since many years, stop it for even a month for some reason, his or her recovery process goes back almost by one year,” the 28-year-old doctor said, adding that he has been sending the parcels through the post office’s Dandi Swami Branch.‘HOMEOPATHY REQUIRES PREPARATION OF MEDICINE DOSES’Dr Rajesh Sofat, a homoeopath whose clinic is based on Pakhowal Road, said a homeopathic treatment requires preparation of medicine doses, making it difficult to prescribe the medicines to a patient over phone.“In homeopathy, we treat every patient differently based on his/her medical history, body, immune system and other factors. We prepare medicines for every patient separately which is why prescribing them medicines over phone is not an option,” he said.Dr Sofat, who is also a professor in Lord Mahavira Homoeopathic Medical College and Hospital, said he has been sending medicines to his regular patients in various cities, including Jalandhar, Phagwara, Barnala and Bengaluru. “I am sending the stock of medicines as per the demands of the patients. For some, the doses are being made for 15 days, while for others, one-month doses are being parcelled,” he said.Jagminder Singh Bedi, an inspector of Moffusil (Rural) post office, said they are delivering the medicine parcels on priority basis in view of the ongoing conditions. “Though the government has allowed the courier companies to operate, not many have started the operations, so, we have been carrying out all the parcel services as part of essential services. The department of posts is also providing pick-up service of medicine parcels from the clinics and distributors,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/homeopathy-doctors-in-ludhiana-availing-parcel-service-to-send-medicines-to-patients-in-other-cities/story-qBxCabcA8iv4H3IFKKnfwJ.html

She was allegedly sold to the employer for ₹60,000, said police.The girl’s statement was recorded by the Child Welfare Committee (CWC) and she was sent to a childcare institution, where she is under isolation, before undergoing a medical examination, including a Covid-19 test.Activists of Bachpan Bachao Andolan (BBA), an NGO, in Panchkula and Delhi had informed the police that the girl had been trafficked from Ranchi and was being forced to work against her will at a residence in the city.According to an FIR lodged at the Sector 29 police station, after police verification and counselling of the girl, a case under sections 363 (punishment for kidnapping) and 368 (wrongfully concealing or keeping in confinement) of the Indian Penal Code and sections 75 and 79 of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, were lodged against three persons — two traffickers and employer in New Delhi.The girl’s employers at the Sushant Lok residence are also liable to be booked under the law.According to the police, the girl said that the trafficker had taken her to Delhi in 2019, where a relative of his arranged for her to work as a domestic help at a residence in C-Block in Greater Kailash. Her employer then sent her to work at his daughter’s residence in Sushant Lok-1 of Gurugram.Alleging that her employers at the Gurugram residence would not serve her food and made her work late hours, the girl told the police that she was not allowed to step out of the house and was not paid for her work. “I would be beaten up often. I would cry and often told them that I wanted to return to my village,” the girl said.According to the police, the girl managed to talk to her mother in Ranchi, by dialling her uncle’s phone, who advised her to contact her aunt in Delhi once the lockdown is lifted.Meanwhile, the girl’s mother contacted a Ranchi-based NGO, Pratigya, which informed the Delhi-based BBA. Members of the BBA in Panchkula, subsequently, took up the matter with the Gurugram police.Manish Sharma, BBA spokesperson said, “The police must probe in-depth the role of the two traffickers and arrest them at the earliest. Although the police acted swiftly in this case, there were some lacunae in the case so far as their training is concerned. It appears that they were not aware of child-related laws. The girl must have been treated with sympathy. The next important step should be to ensure that the girl is properly rehabilitated and her wages recovered from her employer,” he said.Karan Goel, the assistant commissioner of police, DLF, said that they took prompt action on the complaint and rescued the girl within a few hours. “Her statement was recorded and we had informed the child welfare committee members who have shifted her to one of the CCI’s in the city. We have informed her mother and relatives who would reach the city and take a decision on her rehabilitation,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/17-yr-old-trafficked-girl-forced-to-work-as-domestic-help-rescued/story-szr8y8R2Pu3JNOT204gyDP.html
04-05-2020||Gurugram||Lockdown 3.0: Pandemonium after migrant workers gather for ‘registration’||Pandemonium ensued at a government school in village Khoh, IMT Manesar, after hundreds of migrant workers allegedly assembled there to register themselves for the interstate movement to their respective native states on Sunday morning. The administration officials, however, denied that any such registration process was being conducted at the spot. The police said no persons were injured as a team of at least 20 policemen was rushed to the area to disperse the crowd to prevent a law and order situation.According to the police, the incident took place on Sunday morning near at a government school, where a large crowd of migrant population had lined up to collect food being distributed by the district administration.Deepak Saharan, deputy commissioner of police (DCP), Manesar, said, “In addition to people who had lined up for the food, many migrant workers arrived at the spot after they received information that registration for returning to their native states was being conducted. To avoid a law and order situation, a team from IMT Manesar police station was rushed to the spot to disperse the crowd since the area is quite congested. No persons were injured and the situation is under control. Legal action would be taken against people who violated the guidelines of lockdown and social distancing.”In a video that surfaced online, scores of migrant workers could be seen running out of a premises, where they had lined up to collect food, as police sirens blared in the background.Rajender Singh, sarpanch, village Khoh, said that around 10.30 am, he received information that a huge crowd of migrant workers had assembled near a government school. “Some rumours had circulated that forms are being filled for registration of migrant workers so they could return to their native states, following which at least 2000 migrants assembled. I informed the police and the situation was sorted out,” said Singh.Bijender Rana, tehsildar, Manesar, denied that the administration was conducting any registration process at the spot.“The authenticity of the alleged video is being verified. The migrant workers are provided food at the concerned school on a daily basis. I am not aware of any rumours regarding filing up of forms for interstate movement of migrants,” he said.On Saturday, the Haryana government had launched an online portal for online registration of migrant workers and stranded persons, who wished to return to their home states. The government had said that the migrants would have to register themselves on a webpage or register through a mobile application (Jan Sahayak Help me) from Google Playstore. Additionally, if any migrant worker does not have access to the above two and is stuck in Haryana, he/she may take assistance from the district administration by dialling 1950 or call centre number 1100, the officials had said.According to preliminary estimates, lakhs of migrant workers are stuck in the state due to the nationwide lockdown imposed to contain the Covid-19 spread. On Saturday, the chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar had appealed to the migrant labourers to remain in the state and not return to their native villages as several industries were going to resume operations in coming days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/pandemonium-after-migrant-workers-gather-for-registration/story-MVDJeWyQcQp7QY5WPGMLOO.html

Though earlier, classes were held in schools for six hours daily, now, even if the teachers conduct online classes for about three hours every day, a lot of syllabus can be completed,” Jagraon said, adding that the teachers can use this time to make innovative videos that explain various concepts. Jagraon said, “As the lockdown has been extended in the state till May 17, teachers must encourage students to study online.

04-05-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai Police say lack of doctors poses a problem in clearing migrants for travel||The Mumbai Police, which has been entrusted with the work of drawing a list of migrant workers, tourists, students, pilgrims and others stranded in their jurisdiction, said that lack of doctors and funding are two major issues they are facing with the compilation work. Pranaya Ashok, DCP (ops) and Mumbai Police spokesperson, said, “We have received about 10,000 applications so far and expect about 1.5 lakh people to apply in total.” “We have registered medical practitioners and the zonal DCPs working to verify the medical documents provided,” Ashok said, adding that there is also a need to verify if the applicant is a migrant worker or a city resident looking to spend the lockdown in their hometown. “This is a problem and hence, we have asked migrant labourers to apply in groups and one group leader will collect the forms and submit them as well. This will also help in social distancing,” he said. The Mumbai Police also wrote a letter to the municipal commissioner, seeking help to solve the shortage of doctors to screen the applicants and verify medical documents.A senior IPS officer confirmed the development to HT, adding, “Local registered medical practitioners are not supporting us. They refuse to examine the migrants or issue medical clearance certificates. “We have written to municipal commissioner Praveen Paredeshi in this regard and raised our concerns.”“Our personnel have communicated with many doctors, requesting them for help through various WhatsApp groups. We also offered our personal protection equipment (PPE) to them and assured that we would take care of all the safety requirements,” the officer said. “The police are taking all possible measures to overcome the hurdles and ensure the effective and smooth execution of the task of sending back stranded migrants to their hometowns,” said Vinoy Kumar Choubey, additional director general (law and order), Mumbai. Shashikant Bhandare, senior inspector at Nirmal Nagar police station, said, “We have requested four doctors to open their clinics so that migrants can get medical certificates.” Someshwar Kamthe senior inspector Amboli police station added that officers have also been deployed at each clinic to maintain social distancing norms. Migrant labourers voice their issues Sajan Ali, 36, a migrant labourer from Bihar, stranded in Kandivli (East), who worked as a site supervisor said, “I am stuck with 60 migrants from Bihar and West Bengal at the construction site. We somehow managed to get the medical certificate but now we are asked to pay for our travel. On a bus having a capacity of 50 people, only 25 will be allowed. The estimated cost is ₹ 1.50 lakh and since we did not get paid for the past 50 days, it’s not possible to arrange this amount.” Ajay Ram, 35, a cook who resides with five other workers in Mulund (East), has been trying to figure out a way to reach his home in Jharkhand. “We got forms from the police station, filled them, but they did not accept them back and told us to submit them online,” said Ram. “The doctor charged each of us ₹200 for a medical certificate,” he said.Complaints of people crowding clinics Several people complained to the police about crowding at clinics on Sunday. “The local police have been instructed to patrol clinics in their area to maintain social distancing,” said DCP Ashok. Mahendra Nerlekar senior inspector, Jogeshwar police station added that announcements are being made outside clinics instructing people to maintain safety measures.25 labourers left for Rajasthan in busSangram Nishandar, deputy commissioner of police, zone 1, said, “On Sunday we sent a bus to Rajasthan with 25 people after subjecting them to medical tests. If a group is arranging a bus to travel they will be granted permission after following due procedure.”361 police across state test positive Till Sunday morning, a total of 361 police personnel tested positive for Covid-19, of which 49 have recovered while 309 are still being treated. The home department arranged a special bus for mass Covid-19 screening. On Sunday it was used to screen 60 to 70 personnel at Worli police station. The department plans to use it at other police stations as well. FIRs further dip to just 54 cases on Saturday As the number of cases of Covid-19 is increasing, the number of first information reports (FIRs) for lockdown violations in the city has witnessed a steep fall with only 54 cases registered on Saturday. A maximum of 32 are for gathering in one place and 12 are for not wearing masks. The rest are for illegal use of vehicles and operating non-essential shops. In all 156 were booked and 33 arrested. Maximum forms distributed in DharaviVeeresh Prabhu, additional commissioner of police (central region), said, “Around 10,000 travel forms were distributed in the central region, including the dense slums of Dharavi and Shahunagar where migrants are stranded in huge numbers.” Officers in charge at Shahu Nagar, Dharavi, Wadala TT, and Worli police stations took extra efforts and requested private doctors to operate their clinics. “We are also taking the help of NGOs to rope in more doctors,” said Prabhu.

Containment zones, which will be restricted to hotspots, will remain under lockdown in light of the positive Covid19 cases in the areas. The essential commodities’ shops like groceries, vegetables, milk, meat, among others, will be open from 10am and 6pm.“After 7pm, nothing will be allowed to function.

On Sunday, the proposal was accepted, according to a document shared by a senior jail official.The hostel is run by social justice and special assistance department of the state government.In the second week of April, authorities at Yerawada in Pune; Arthur road and Byculla, in Mumbai, and prisons at Thane and Kalyan had stopped accepting new inmates. Following the development, Sunil Ramanand, additional director general of police, prison, Maharashtra, had issued an order declaring a lockdown in these prisons on April 9.While the administration of the temporary prison will be taken care off by the jail staff, the security of the facility will be done by Pune city police, according to jail authorities.UT Pawar, superintendent, Yerawada Central Jail, said, “The new admissions will be kept there. We cannot be sure if they are carriers of Sars-Cov-2 virus which causes the Covid-19 (coronavirus) infection. We have taken this step as a preventive measure, we cannot risk the lives of inmates”“We, therefore, suggested space and the collector has now granted permission to start the use,” said Pawar.“There are 16 rooms in the hostel that are expected to hold not more than 100-150 inmates,” according to SP Pawar.Even though an order by collector Naval Kishore Ram has been issued and the jail authorities have taken possession of the hostel, the operation is yet to begin.The jail officials will make a representation to the city police authorities and seek police protection to the temporary facility, according to the SP Yerawada Jail.The launch of the temporary facility is subject to the availability of police protection, according to SP Pawar.On the other hand, the jail has been releasing under trial prisoners that fit the criteria defined by a high-powered committee to decongest jails in light of Covid-19 pandemic.Until May 2, 388 under trial inmates from Yerawada Central Jail have been released on personal bond.

We thank the organisers for carrying out the initiative.”“The children are in complete control and care of the garden and perform activities like watering the plants and relish the fresh produce grown within the campus area. Through the said project, the children have learnt the art of energy conservation, water conservation , biodiversity, food safety and security, better nutrition and healthy living,” he said.Work began on the vegetable garden in January 2020, and three months after the plantation, the kitchen garden is currently providing daily fresh organic vegetables such as eggplants, tomatoes, green chillies, coriander, ladies’ finger, cluster beans, carrots and potatoes, various gourds, curry leaves, onion, sweet corn, methi, spinach and other green leafy vegetables.Over the years, the foundation has helped in restoring a training hall, plant flowers and trees in the campus and has painted the kitchen.The foundation has utilised the available space of 30,000 square feet to the fullest ,contributing to the wellness of the children by developing a kitchen garden and sustainable farming.

04-05-2020||Pune||Association considering carrom tournament without spectators: Arun Kedar||PUNE The all India carrom federation and the Maharashtra carrom association have cancelled five tournaments in the last two months due to the ongoing covid-19 pandemic and officials believe more will be postponed in 2020.The organisers are now planning to hold tournaments without spectators, once the government allows sports activities across the country. According to Arun Kedar, treasurer, all India carrom federation and vice president of Maharashtra carrom association keeping social distancing in a sport like carrom is very hard.“In other sports, spectators at least keep some distance from players but in carrom, everyone surrounds the players. Only inches separate the referee, players and the spectators.”Kedar said.The association believes it will be hard to conduct tournaments through the end of December due to the covid-19 threat.“One more thing which will impact carrom in Maharashtra is red zone cities. All these regions host many tournaments but now when games will resume there is uncertainty,” added Kedar.Carrom tournaments are generally played throughout the year, but during monsoon season many new players connect with the sport.“In monsoon many people don’t get chance to play outdoor games and many of them are inclined towards carrom and we get many new players during monsoon,” Kedar said.Players miss club practiceThe basics of the game are learned by playing in a club, therefore a lot of players prefer it.“In carrom, there are two types of players – seniors who like to practice on their own at home while others who go to club for daily practice. New players are usually found more in the second type and in this year we will be missing such players and the worrying part is if these new players don’t play carrom regularly they will lose interest in the sport,” added Kedar.Digital learning for players To keep players updated with carrom knowledge, the state association is sharing videos of classical matches and also sharing facts of the game among players and coaches.“These matches teach many things to players and one can concentrate on how champions execute their game plan in the final matches. Every day we share couple of games and facts to improve the knowledge of the game among players,” he added.In the coming days, the national association is planning to come out with informative videos.“Instead of reading booklet of game laws or online documents, we are planning to make informative videos to give carrom lovers something different. The making of the video is currently under progress,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/association-considering-carrom-tournament-without-spectators/story-Gmmk631J04V3MaTJvaMNeI.html

While real estate body Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Associations of India (Credai) has welcomed the move, it raised apprehension about the execution of order given the lack of clarity on the supply of raw material.“We are allowing under-construction works in non- affected areas in Pune district, including non-containment zones in the city,” said district collector Naval Kishore Ram. He added the move was aimed at discouraging migrant workers from returning home.Suhas Merchant, president, Credai, said, “Although the offices in Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) will still be closed, the sites will open even as we have to apply for permissions with local offices for engineers and supervisors to reach the site. There is also a confusion on how we are going to procure raw material, without which we cant restart any construction activity.”According to Merchant, there are around 10,000 projects (small, large capacity) underway in city’s Baner, Pashan, Balewadi, PMRDA (Bhugaon, Mhalunge and Sus road) and in PCMC areas.“We want to complete several of the work onsite, on the basement, mezzanines before the rainy season and hopefully within the next two to three days, we should have clarity on where we stand with more than 10,000 projects underway,” he said.According to the order issued by Ram, health screening of labourers should be done twice a week while only those workers who are physically fit will be permitted to work. The order states that all pre-monsoon related works including flood protection, waterproofing, construction of retaining walls and backfilling etc have been allowed at the construction sites in the non-containment zones.Shrikant Paranjape of Paranjape Constructions, said, “We are ready to begin work tomorrow provided my engineers can reach the sites. As of now, it looks difficult with some parts of the city under the red zone, though our work sites are all outside Pune, we will begin work as soon as we have clarity over the issue of raw materials and goods reaching the site.”Some of the other developers and builders, plan to take some days to take stock of what is in store.“We plan to do a formal assessment of the post COVID infrastructure, for with the new orders allowing the migrant labourers also to travel back to their homes, we need to find out how many are there, only then can we begin,” Ranjit Naik Navare of Naik Navare Associates.Ram said,“ We have received many complaints from the labour camps that they were frustrated sitting idle with no work and no pay. These two factors made us open up the interstate travel permissions, and also the permission to open the construction sites where we are sure social distancing will be followed with work only within the sites and no one allowed from outside.”“We have also allowed goods, raw materials to the site,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/builders-raise-doubts-about-procurement-of-raw-material-in-pune/story-WOaqiAY7dBvhlAKJpJVdiO.html
04-05-2020||Pune||On the frontline: Despite doorstep service, people still venture out, risking the life of others, says Abhijeet Gaikwad||Abhijeet Gaikwad (30) is a chemist who runs Kushi Medicals and Surgicals in Thergaon not only keeps his shop open for walk-in customers but also ensures that medicines are delivered to the doorstep. He works at the store till 2 pm and then home delivers medicines till 8pm in the Pimpri-Chinchwad. He speaks to HT about his role in times of the Covid-19 (coronavirus) pandemicWhat exactly is your role in this crisis?My duty is to provide medicines to the needy. In lockdown, I have doubled up my duty. I am operating the store and I am also delivering medicines at home.How does your day begin and roll out?Being a chemist, my priority is going to the shop daily. Sometimes my family members object to it due to the fear of Covid-19, but I cannot sit at home during the time of crisis. The police have given us permission to keep the store open till 2 pm, so from 9 am to 2 pm I am at the shop. I have shared my phone number in various WhatsApp groups for home delivery. Most residents send a copy of the prescription on WhatsApp and then I deliver the medicines at home for free. I do deliveries till 8 pm. The orders I have received are mostly from diabetic and high/ low blood pressure patients.What precautions are you taking?I am taking general precautions like wearing mask, washing hands and taking a bath after reaching home. Other then these, while delivering the medicines, we prefer online payment. If they are giving us cash, I prefer to take money in an envelope to avoid hand touch. I follow all government guideline and check the prescription before delivering medicines.What is your assessment of the Covid-19 crisis in Pune?The Pune administration is doing very good job, be it the police, doctors or even vegetable, fruit vendors and chemist. However, there is a lack of awareness and people are still coming out of their homes on the pretext of buying medicines, but they only want to roam on the street. It is because of this that we have to shut shops at 2 pm. People, who are educated, also do not understand the importance of staying at home. Another thing is that people are panic buying. Everything is available at the doorstep including groceries, vegetables, medicines, milk and other essential items, despite this people still venture out of homes putting everyone at risk.What gaps do you see in health and relief work?The Pune district administration is doing a commendable job. I don’t see any gaps in health and relief work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/despite-doorstep-service-of-essential-items-people-still-venture-out-risking-everyone-s-life/story-o7znAu9C69KJbrtyio3JLN.html

In fact, the crowd became so massive, even in the wee hours, that HP administration had to call the police to control it. Thereafter, it was decided that students and women would be given a priority, dashing the hopes of many others.Of the 2,000 or so people gathered at the spot, only 1,314 were evacuated.In a statement, Jai Ram Thakur, chief minister of Himachal Pradesh, said, “As many as 1,314 persons stranded in the tricity were brought back to the home state in 51 buses. These included 609 from Kangra, 335 from Hamirpur, 132 from Una and 238 from Chamba.”Bihari Lal, who came to Sector 28 from Nayagaon around 5.30 am was denied boarding by authorities. “I came with great difficulty with my son and wife. It was raining so they asked us to sit in the hall. There were hundreds of others inside, and as the day progressed, more and more people began to come,” he said.Suman Kumari, 50, who came from Sector 19 on foot, said, “We were asked to stand outside when they announced that the facility was only for females and students. However, the notice released by HP government did not mention so.”“An argument broke out between people after which the police also resorted to violent means of controlling the situation. Some of us who were making videos of the episode were stopped from doing so by the police,” said Bihari Lal.“It is pertinent to mention that Chandigarh has been designated as red zone by the Government of India while most Himachal districts are either in orange or green zones. The manner in which social distancing was ignored here will lead to a sharp increase in cases in HP,” said Shubham Thakur, an engineer based in IT park from Kangra.In a statement, the Himachal CM said that people coming home particularly from the red or orange zones must ensure that while remaining in home quarantine, they maintain social distancing even with family members.Omkar Chand Sharma, nodal officer, Himachal Pradesh, refused to comment on the matter whereas Sanjay Kundu, principal secretary to CM said that all protocols mandated by ministry of home affairs (MHA) were followed and communications to respective states and the UT were sent out. He also said that HP has clarified that only those who are stranded and in distress will be evacuated from now. DSP Charanjeet, Chandigarh Police, said, “No one had expected that such a large crowd would gather. The HP government had called for Chandigarh police at 6 am, but many people had come even before that. Chandigarh Police later had to enforce social distancing.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chaos-in-chandigarh-as-2-000-himachalis-gather-for-evacuation/story-eKawSPW8W4C5VzREryZlTJ.html
04-05-2020||Pune||Pune’s Sassoon hospital gets ICMR nod for blood plasma therapy||The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has given permission to Pune-based Sassoon General Hospital to carry out plasma therapy, offering hopes to those Covid-19 patients who are critical, according to a senior health official. The ICMR nod to government-run Sassoon hospital came on Saturday, when city’s death count of Covid-19 positive patients crossed 100 with 68 of them at Sassoon hospital itself.Sassoon hospital is now the second such facility in the state after Mumbai to explore the therapy on critically ill Covid-19 patients. In Mumbai, a patient died even after plasma therapy earlier last week.“With the permission from ICMR granted, we will take further steps in terms of the therapy in the next two to three days,” said Dr Subhash Salunkhe, chairman, Communicable Diseases Prevention and Control Technical Committee.It was former Sassoon hospital dean Dr Ajay Chandanwale who had sent the proposal to ICMR requesting permission for plasma therapy, accordingly the required equipments were also brought to the hospital.To give plasma therapy to a positive Covid-19 patient, coverage under insurance and also Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) permission is a must. After these clearances were obtained, the way to start the procedure has been cleared.A city-based firm Avinash Bhosale infrastructure limited (ABIL ) group last week donated Rs 28 lakh to Sassoon hospital to buy equipments required to extract plasma from the blood of a recovered patient.“We have received all the necessary approvals as per the protocol and soon the clinical trials for plasma therapy will start on Covid-19 positive patients. The process of making a list of donors who have recovered from the disease and are willing to donate plasma is being made. The samples will be sent for testing to National Institute of Virology (NIV) for antibodies against virus,” said Pune district collector Naval Kishore Ram.According to Salunkhe, the administration has prepared a list of donors and a message is being communicated to them.“We have prepared a list of around 35 probable donors who were cured, recovered and discharged from the Naidu Hospital earlier in March. Our counsellors and social workers are in continuous touch with them, their entire screening and checkup will be done and then its process will start. The first transmission has not yet happened in Pune and only Sassoon hospital has got the approval from the ICMR. In the next couple of days the things will get clearer and the actual process of the plasma therapy will start in the city,” said Salunkhe||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/sassoon-hospital-gets-icmr-nod-for-blood-plasma-therapy/story-A9gi9mLrM0HMzcqM8DhDML.html

However, the units are now closed due to lockdown and residents have not been able detect the source of polluted water.”“We now suspected that the source of the dirty water is choked sewers. Stagnant water is posing a serious threat to the safety of the people. Foul smell continues to emanate all the time from area. Though we have not carried out any test, but as the water is discolouring and eroding the walls of houses, it definitely has chemicals,” commented Makkar.“I am going to send a complaint to the chairman of the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) requesting him to find the source of contamination and take necessary action,” he said.“So far, we have not allowed dyeing units to operate, so chemical waste discharge is not possible. I will depute an officer to visit the area and necessary action will be taken after the area is checked,” said PPCB superintendent engineer Sandeep Behl.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/contaminated-water-in-ludhiana-s-prem-nagar-colony-a-threat-to-lives-of-residents/story-G5i4qt7OCLHTfLwOMngKiM.html

The incident was captured in a closed-circuit television (CCTV) camera installed near the house.The victim has been identified as Uday Kant, 52.The CCTV footage showed three men on a motorcycle stopping near his house. Two of them talk to the victim briefly and as soon as he turns to go inside the house, they stab him with sharp-edged weapons.On hearing Uday Kant’s screams, his family came out and rushed him to a nearby hospital, which referred him to Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh.Avdhesh Kumar, son of the injured, said that around 5.30am when his father was standing outside the house, a bike stopped near him. Three men on a bike came near his father and talked to him for a few seconds before stabbing him and fleeing the spot.Jamalpur station house officer (SHO) inspector Harjinder Singh said that prima facie it appears that the accused are known to the victim and the matter seems to be of some old rivalry as the accused did not snatch anything.

04-05-2020||Pune||Pune may have 9,642 Covid-19 positive cases by May 31, says civic chief||The city may report at least 9,600 Covid-19 positive cases by the end of this month, according to Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad.To house Covid-19 positive patients, the civic body is now planning to turn its institutional quarantine centres into isolation centres, where positive patients can receive treatment instead of quarantining the suspected cases.“We are estimating about 9,642 positive cases by May end and so, we are preparing for the same. Currently, we have ten institutional quarantine centres where suspected patients who have come in close contact with positive patients are being kept. This is like a rolling stock where suspected patients are replaced every 14 days, Gaikwad said.As of April 30, the civic body found a total of 15,909 contacts of positive patients in various areas which includes family members or neighbours or people that might have come in contact with the person who was tested positive in the last 14 days.Out of these 15,909 suspects, 5,507 were found to be high risk and 10,402 were found to be low risk.The high-risk contacts include those who have other health ailments like diabetes and hypertension. Pregnant women and senior citizens are also considered a high risk that needs institutional quarantine.Currently, the civic body has a capacity of 2,085 beds at the 10 institutional quarantine centres. Quarantine centres stop the spread of the virus in cases where the person is not yet detected positive, but might turn positive later.“The institutional quarantine will be turned into isolation centres for the treatment of patients. Creating proper institutional quarantine also takes a lot of effort right from arranging beds, arranging food and also toilet facilities,” Gaikwad added.So, far at least 5,000 high-risk contacts needed institutional quarantine, the civic body currently has 2,000 beds at the quarantine centres.“We are focusing more on providing hospitality to suspected patients rather than completely focus on treating the positive patients due to the sheer number. We have to provide food, toilet facility and beds to all of them. Right from providing toothbrush to ensuring that all the basic needs are fulfilled, my staff is completely dedicated to that. Logistics is a major challenge for us right now,” Gaikwad said.He further added that the civic body will not follow the revised Indian council of medical research (ICMR) guidelines which call for home quarantine of suspected patients.“We are doing around 1,000 tests per day which means 1,000 people need to be housed as they are suspected patients till their test reports come out. Earlier, the high-risk contacts were being quarantined at institutional centres for 14 days which will now be discontinued. These people will be asked to continue quarantine at home,” he added.According to Gaikwad, the civic body is looking at resolving this problem by taking over marriage halls and appointing central kitchen teams where fresh food can be provided.The civic administration is yet to take over the Balewadi sports complex hostel which will have a capacity of over 10,000 beds.“We recently received over 1,000 mattresses, we have to place the beds in a way that we can remove them after a month or two once the pandemic is over and we vacate the premises,” he said.The civic body claims that 100 percent of the city’s populace has been surveyed as of April 30, and about 50 percent of the population is being resurveyed for precautionary measures through door-to-door surveys. On an average of about 2, 00,000 residents have been visited daily by PMC officials since the last 10 days.Institutional quarantine centres:The ten institutional quarantine centres have a total of 2,085 beds:1. Sinhgad Girls Hostel Panhala (IQ): 3502. Sinhgad Inst, Raigad Hostel: 2853. SM Joshi College, Hadapsar: 1204. Trinity College Hostel, Kondhwa: 1505. Sinhgad College, Kondhwa: 1506.

The complainant had called on a fake helpline number which he found via a search engine, to ask about two bhujiya packets worth Rs 400 that he had ordered but not received.A first information report (FIR) was registered by the Borivli police station on Saturday and the case is being investigated by the state cyber police.According to the Borivli police, on April 22, the complainant had ordered groceries from a retail website. While he received all the products, he did not get two bhujiya packets worth Rs 400 which he had ordered.On May 1 the businessman searched for a helpline number of the grocery website online and got a fake number which had been uploaded by a cyber-fraudster. When he called on the number, the fraudster asked the businessman to give his bank account number, registered mobile number, and the three-digit CVV of his ATM card.The fraudster then sent him a link and asked him to forward it to another mobile number. He then asked the complainant to pass on his UPI pin and the subsequent OTP received. Within two hours, four transactions were made from the complainant’s account and a total of Rs 2.25 lakh was withdrawn. Ritesh Bhatia a cybercrime investigator said, “The fraudster was successful in setting up the UPI account on his device by convincing the victim to share his banking details. The fraudster also had the card details and hence, was successful in withdrawing such large amounts within seconds. It’s surprising to know that people still don’t hesitate to share OTP s and CVV numbers.”Harish Baijal, deputy inspector general of state cyber police, said that cyber fraud has been on the rise during the lockdown as more people are shopping online. “There has been a spurt in such cases and fraudsters are adopting new modus operandi to dupe people during the lockdown. People need to be careful. We keep issuing advisories and create awareness through our Twitter handle,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/man-inquires-about-missing-food-order-loses-2-22-lakh/story-QPSvRRXEoG4Ncg7rilEIeL.html

Now imagine the plight if you are a doctor who is out amid Covid-19 lockdown to reach the hospital to treat patients. At a time when repair shops are all shut, and no other on road assistance is available either, this isn’t a good situation to be in. READ| Virat Kohli, Ishant Sharma laud Delhi Police for work during lockdownAnd this is what Dr Mansha Zarabi Kaul had to face recently. The Greater Kailash-based medic’s car broke down on a morning when she had to go to a hospital. Feel helpless, she decided to call Delhi Police for assistance. Recalling the incident, Kaul says, “My car broke down and I had to reach my hospital in Indirapuram and I was clueless what to do! Everything is shut due to lockdown... Then I called the police station and the cops on the other end of the phone were quick to respond and send help. They even arranged a mechanic to get a spare part.” Applauding the help she received in just the nick of time, Kaul adds, “The efforts of the police personnel were commendable in helping me fix my vehicle. I feel great and expect them to continue offering such help to other citizens as well.” READ | With senior citizens left to fend for themselves, Delhi Police step inThough it seems as just another incident in the city where a car is broken and is repaired within a few minutes, it wasn’t easy in this case. Som Nath Paruthi, SHO of Greater Kailash Police Station, says, “First we had to locate the house of a mechanic in our nearby premises, and then took him to the house of Dr Kaul. The toughest part was to find out the spare part for the car that was needed to repair it. After some efforts we managed to get it and felt happy to help a doctor, who are the real heroes of our country. It felt good when she WhatsApped us later thanking us; it was a beautiful gesture from her side.” Well, it’s true when they say that real heroes don’t wear capes!

So far, about 178 cases have been reported where the cops helped in transporting expecting mothers to hospitals, while ensuring their safely en route.Pankaj Kumar Sharma, a resident of Badarpur, who is now a father to a baby girl, says, “I dialled several helpline numbers when my wife started experiencing labour pain, but couldn’t get through any one of them. Then, out of sheer panic I rang up the Delhi Police and the personnel reached our house within 20 minutes to take us to a hospital. I’m grateful to them for having saved the life of my wife and child.” It’s the PCR vans — used during patrolling to ensure that social distancing is being followed — that are acting as emergency ambulances to save lives of pregnant women who have gone into labour during this time. “We are trying our best to save precious lives. We have been successful in helping out all the 178 cases we have handled so far. All mothers and babies are doing fine,” says Sharat Kumar Sinha, DCP, PCR, adding that during the coronavirus pandemic, when movement is restricted, people are looking up to the police for help. “In the time of lockdown, the movement of private vehicles is restricted and the ambulances are mostly busy in handling the patients affected by coronavirus. In such times, our PCR vans are doubling up as ambulances to take expecting mothers to the hospital. We usually allow one family member to accompany the patient so that they feel reassured, and the mandate of social distancing is also respected,” adds Sinha. Heena Khatun, a resident of Maharani Bagh, is now a mother to a girl. “When my sister-in-law started experiencing labour pains, we couldn’t think of anything and called the police. They were quick to respond to our call, the PCR arrived at 2 o’clock in the night to assist us, and took us to a hospital. The baby and mother are healthy, thanks to the Police,” says a relative of Khatun, on condition of anonymity.

Most of the calls we receive are well past midnight and we respond to calls from remote locations too. We are only doing our duty,” shares Sinha.

04-05-2020||World||UK to pilot coronavirus contact tracing smartphone app||The UK government on Monday announced that after hitting its testing target for coronavirus of over 100,000 tests daily, it will now be moving into the track and trace phase of its fight against the deadly virus, which has claimed 28,734 lives across hospitals and the wider community in the country.UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the daily Downing Street briefing that central to the track and trace phase will be a new contact tracing smartphone app, which is set for a pilot in the Isle of Wight region of England this week.“The goal is to keep the number of new infections going down, and bringing in the new programme from tomorrow (Tuesday) in the Isle of Wight and the rest of the country thereafter will help that,” said Hancock. “Our goal is not simply to flatten the curve, but to get the occurrence to very low levels,” he said.The app, developed by the digital arm of the state-funded National Health Service NHSX, is designed to alert users when they have come into contact with someone who has coronavirus symptoms and should seek a COVID-19 test. After the pilot of the “test, track and trace procedures” on the island, the app is expected to be made more widely available to the British public later this month.“This trial does not mean the end of social distancing on the Isle of Wight or anywhere else,” Hancock stressed, as he appealed to everyone living in that region to download the app.From among the questions from members of the public at the briefing, the minister was also asked about the steps being taken by the government to protect black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) staff within the NHS after reports of them being at higher risk from Covid-19.“We recognise that there has been a disproportionately high rate of deaths among BAME care workers,” said Hancock, adding that work is on to understand it scientifically. Jonathan Van-Tam, the Deputy Chief Medical Office for England, added that the NHS is taking this “incredibly seriously”.“A large programme of work has been put in place… the NHS will get to the bottom of this,” he said.The government launched a review into the disparity in death rates from Covid-19 among BAME communities, including Indians, last month. One hypothesis is that people from BAME communities have higher rates of underlying health conditions, such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension, and this may increase their vulnerability and risk. The Research and Innovation Forum of the British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin (BAPIO) has been among the many medical associations lobbying the government for steps to protect this vulnerable category of the NHS workforce. NHS England recently advised hospital trusts to make “appropriate arrangements” to ensure BAME doctors and nurses are shielded as best as possible on the job, including being given less frontline roles in the pandemic fightback.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-to-pilot-coronavirus-contact-tracing-smartphone-app/story-QcaMTDJhMsMdFeyq6monBP.html
04-05-2020||World||Donald Trump pledges ‘conclusive’ report on China, ups US toll projection to 100k||President Donald Trump has promised a “conclusive” report on the US investigation into Chinas handling of the coronavirus outbreak and he once against revised projections for US toll, which he said, could now hit 100,000.“We’re going to be giving a very strong report as to exactly what we think happened. And I think it will be very conclusive,” Trump said a “virtual town hall” hosted Sunday by Fox News. “My opinion is they made a mistake. They tried to cover it, they tried to put it out., just like a fire.”The US has disputed the Chinese version of the origin of Covid-19 — from a meats and fresh produce market in Wuhan — and alleged it started instead at a virology lab in the same city. And it has also accused Beijing of delaying alerting the rest of the world and of suppressing the true extent of its epidemic.Secretary of state Mike Pompeo has said the US has “enormous evidence” of the outbreak began at the Wuhan lab. He has not shared any evidence, and neither has any US official thus far, despite continued and rising rhetoric against China, with threats of punitive measures, including making China pay for it.China has dismissed these allegations and called them last Thursday an effort by the Trump administration to “shift their own responsibility for the poor handling of the epidemic”.The Trump administration has indeed faced questions about its response to the epidemic, essentially for squandering time gained by the earlyFebruary ban on travelers from China. The president has pushed back and insisted he was, in fact, ahead of the curve, citing the same travel restrictions.At the Fox New town hall, the president sought to shift the blame somewhat on to Anthony Fauci, a top epidemiologist and member of the president’s task force on the outbreak — “everybody, even Tony Fauci, was saying it’s going to pass, not going to be a big deal”.It did not. And the United States has borne the brunt of the pandemic with 1.15 million confirmed and reported infections till Monday morning, a third of the cases worldwide; and 67,710 fatalities, close to a quarter or the global toll. The US numbers went up in the last 24 hours 25,501 infections and 1,313 deaths.President Trump said the town hall he fears the fatalities will go up further, revising upwards his earlier assessments. “We’re going to lose anywhere from 75-, 80- to 100,000 people,” Trump said. “That’s a horrible thing. We shouldn’t lose one person over this. This should’ve been stopped in China.”The president had last week that the toll will “hopefully” wind up under 100,000, changing his earlier assessments of 240,000 way back in March before issuing lockdown guidelines to 60,000 and 70,000 in recent days and weeks, as he has sought to frame the reducing numbers as an achievement.Without the mitigation measures ordered by him the numbers would have been far higher, he has argued.Even at 100,000, his new projection, is way in excess of the 72,433 Covid-19 deaths projected by the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), whose modeling and numbers have been cited often by the Whit House. The IHME projected number if for August, at the current levels of mitigation.With many states rolling back restrictions and reopening some businesses, with the very public backing of the president, experts fear a resurgence, specially those that ignore the federal reopening guidelines and and end up “leapfrogging” conditions laid down for graduating from one phase to another.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-pledges-conclusive-report-on-china-ups-us-toll-projection-to-100k/story-scpxyOMIV54Bpj91dRCWMM.html

It is one among seven new Nightingale hospitals across the UK. There has been a sustained fall in cases, particularly in the hotspot of London in recent days.As of Sunday evening, the UK-wide cumulative death toll was 28,446, with 186,599 cases, and 14,248 people currently in hospitals. Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced last week that the UK is now “past the peak”.A Downing Street spokesman said on Monday that the Nightingale hospital in London was put on ‘standby’ due to limited demand: “It’s not likely that in the coming days we will need to be admitting patients to the London Nightingale while coronavirus in the capital remains under control”.“That’s obviously a very positive thing and we remain grateful to everybody in London for following the government’s advice in helping to protect the NHS. What the Nightingale will be is effectively placed on standby so it would be ready to receive patients should that be required, but we are not anticipating that will be the case.”Similar mega hospitals have been set up in Manchester, Birmingham, Harrogate and Bristol, with two more due to open shortly in Sunderland and Exeter.The spokesman said: “Manchester has taken some patients already; Birmingham, Harrogate and Bristol are ready to take patients if needed…People followed the advice to stay at home, that’s slowed the rate of infection and meant that the NHS wasn’t overwhelmed.”The UK’s hospital system not being overwhelmed by the pandemic is one of the five tests the government has set before easing lockdown restrictions are considered. The others are: that the daily death rate falls sustainably and consistently; that the rate of infection is falling; that the operational challenges have been met’ and most importantly, that there is no risk of a second peak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/falling-covid-19-cases-in-uk-puts-mega-hospital-on-standby/story-yPhhEte8SishOliN9jtoUK.html
04-05-2020||World||Donald Trump predicts Covid-19 vaccine by year end||President Donald Trump on Sunday said he believes a vaccine for Covid-19 will have been found by the end of the year, further shortening the timeline by weeks of even the most optimistic projections for a time-consuming complex process that experts have insisted can take 12 to 18 months.“We think we are going to have a vaccine by the end of this year,” the president said t a virtual town-hall hosted by Fox News Sunday evening at the Lincoln Memorial.He acknowledged straightaway the over-the-top optimism in his assessment. “The doctors would say, ‘Well, you shouldn’t say that’. I’ll say what I think,” he said, adding, “I think we’re going to have a vaccine much sooner than later.”The president went to name the Johnson & Johnson vaccine candidate, which is slated to start human trials in September. A drug from Moderna went under Phase One trial in Washington state in March and has a long way to go.The Trump administration has launched an ambitious Manhattan Project-style effort called “Operation Warp Speed” to speed up the hunt for the vaccine in a private-public partnership. It is reported to have narrowed down the search from an estimated 93 to 14, with plans to further pare it down to seven, and then to 3 or four for final clinical trials in January.Trump’s own top medical advisers have offered January as their most optimistic outlook. “Remember, go back in time, I was saying in January and February that it would be a year to 18 months (to develop a vaccine), so January is a year, so it isn’t that much from what I had originally said,” Anthony Fauci, a top epidemiologist and member of the president’s coronavirus task force told told CBS news last week.And he prefaced that with aa notable qualifier. .”I think that is doable if things fall in the right place.”Deborah Birx, coordinator of the task force, has reservedly agreed January is “doable on paper”. She has also said, reflecting the magnitude of the challenge, “We make forward progress in vaccines and then a little step backwards and then forward progress.”The Trump administration has been eager to get ahead of the epidemic as it faces continued criticism for being slow to respond and the president has sought to project optimism with misleading projections of toll that he has revised upwards several times and by touting untested cures and therapeutics such as the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine, which his own drug regulators has since cautioned against, citing side-effects.As the race for a vaccine continues globally, questions have been raised about safety, specially of volunteers participating in these fast-tracked efforts. “No, because they are volunteers. They know what they’re getting into,” the president said when asked if he worried bout it. “They’re in many cases very good people. They want to help the process. Look, a vaccine has never gone like it’s gone now.”“We’re so far ahead of any vaccine ever in history. These things would take two, four, five, six years,” Trump went on to say.It may take even longer, and indefinitely. A vaccine fr HIV has remained elusive 40 years since the search began.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-predicts-covid-19-vaccine-by-year-end/story-oI4JKfaBv0wTpVABNdQYaK.html
04-05-2020||World||Test, trace, isolate: Scotland reveals TTI strategy to ease lockdown||‘Test, trace, isolate’: Scotland’s first minister Nicola Sturgeon on Monday revealed her government’s new approach to ease restrictions, but insisted that conditions are not yet conducive to any change in the measures to deal with the coronavirus pandemic.Sturgeon’s announcement came in the context of growing demands that the Boris Johnson government disclose UK-wide measures to lift some restrictions, as the death toll neared the 29,000 mark, with nearly 1.9 lakh cases.She said in Edinburgh: “We will test people in the community who have symptoms consistent with Covid-19. We will use contact tracing, a well-established public health intervention, to identify the close contacts of those cases, who may have had the disease transmitted to them”.“We will ask and support those close contacts to self-isolate, so that if they do develop the disease, there is less risk that they will pass it on to others. And we will make sure that support is available to enable people to isolate effectively”.However, Sturgeon stressed that the TTI approach will be most effective when levels of infection are low and stay low, adding that its success relies on people knowing and agreeing what to do when symptoms emerge, and being prepared to self-isolate when advised to do so.Johnson is due to reveal a ‘roadmap’ out of the lockdown on Sunday, which reportedly includes measures to minimise employees using equipment, stagger shift times and maximise home-working, according to a leaked draft.But the UK must not lift restrictions too soon, only when its five tests are met, he said in a video message on Monday, adding: “The worst thing we could do now is ease up too soon and allow a second peak of coronavirus.” The five tests are: That the National Health Service can continue to cope; that the daily death rate falls sustainably and consistently; that the rate of infection is falling; that the operational challenges have been met’ and most importantly, that there is no risk of a second peak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/test-trace-isolate-scotland-reveals-tti-strategy-to-ease-lockdown/story-E6uX0HeXiHu7oP8ERuYdCL.html
04-05-2020||World||Global markets drop, spooked by China-US row over Covid-19||Shares took a turn for the worse on Monday as tensions between the Trump administration and China over the origins and handling of the coronavirus pandemic rattled investors.Benchmarks fell in most markets except for Australia, which was lifted by signs its own virus outbreak is being brought under control. India’s Sensex plunged nearly 6% as authorities extended their pandemic-fighting lockdown for another two weeks and new data showed an unprecedented drop in factory activity.Germany’s DAX dropped 3.3% to 10,507.33 and the CAC 40 in Paris lost 4% to 4,389.97. Britain’s FTSE 100 declined 0.5% to 5,735.00. The future for the S&P 500 slipped 1.1% and that for the Dow industrials lost 1.2%, pointing to a lower open on Wall Street.Tokyo, Shanghai and Bangkok were among markets closed for holidays. Stocks had closed broadly lower on Wall Street on Friday after Amazon and other big companies reported disappointing results.Criticized over his handling of the crisis, President Donald Trump has tried to shift the blame to China. Beijing has repeatedly pushed back on U.S. accusations that the outbreak was China’s fault.The antagonisms threaten to undo the truce in a trade war between Washington and Beijing that was struck just before China began shutting much of its economy down in late January to fight the pandemic.A 4-page Department of Homeland Security intelligence report dated May 1 and obtained by The Associated Press contends that Chinese leaders “intentionally concealed the severity” of the pandemic from the world in early January.It alleges, citing variances in trade patterns, that China was downplaying the severity of its outbreak, first reported in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, while stockpiling medical supplies.“The renewed possibility of the return of the trade war that had plagued markets since at least 2017 once again weighed on sentiment,” Jingyi Pan of IG said in a commentary.Tensions over the pandemic and threats to hit back with trade sanctions have amped up risk, Mizuho Bank said in a report.“Even as growth-stifling containment measures are set to be phased out in May, the global downturn looks to deepen in Q2,” it said, adding that anti-China threats from Trump, on top of record job losses, may result in a continuation of the “Mayday” type of fear dynamics.There is no public evidence of an intentional plot to buy up the world’s medical supplies, though China did muzzle doctors who warned of the virus early on. But it informed the World Health Organization of the outbreak on Dec. 31; contacted the U.S. Centers for Disease Control on Jan. 3 and publicly identified the pathogen as a novel coronavirus on Jan. 8. Many of its missteps appear to have stemmed from bureaucratic hurdles.Wall Street has been bracing for a poor showing by companies this earnings season due to the economic shock from the coronavirus. Many companies have pulled their earnings guidance for the rest of the year, citing uncertainty about how much of an impact the outbreak will have on their business and the economy, which is now in a recession.Bleak trade and manufacturing data are also discouraging investors on the lookout for upbeat news on steps to stop the pandemic and prevent a resurgence in cases in places that are beginning to reopen after shutdowns.Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index fell 4.2% to 23,613.80 on Monday. The Kospi in South Korea dropped 2.7% to 1,895.37. Shares also fell by more than 2% in Singapore, Taiwan and Jakarta.Australia’s S&P ASX/200 gained 1.4% to 5,320.30, rebounding from early losses on gains in miners and banks.The yield on the 10-year Treasury edged lower, to 0.60% from 0.62% on Friday, well below its 1.90% level at the start of the year.Benchmark U.S. crude oil fell $1.39 to $18.39 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It gained 94 cents on Friday to $19.78 per barrel. U.S. crude has plunged from its perch of roughly $60 at the start of the year on worries about a collapse in demand and strained storage facilities. Brent crude, the international standard, gave up 56 cents to $25.88 per barrel.The dollar fetched 106.74 Japanese yen, down from 106.88 yen on Friday. The euro weakened to $1.0939 from $1.0980.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/global-markets-drop-spooked-by-china-us-row-over-covid-19/story-5ZHVVYGveiI4Z0HFiClr3I.html

Security Council arms embargo on Tehran, an Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman said on Monday. “Iran is not seeking to exit the 2015 nuclear deal with six powers ... America’s move is illegitimate and our reaction will be proportionate,” Abbas Mousavi said in a televised weekly news conference.The United States said on Thursday it was “hopeful” the U.N. Security Council would extend the arms embargo on Iran before it expires in October. President Donald Trump’s administration has been taking a harder line with the United Nations over its desire to extend and strengthen the embargo on Iran.Washington has threatened to trigger a return of all U.N. sanctions on Iran as leverage to get backing from the 15-member Security Council on extending the U.N. arms embargo on Tehran.“The United States is not a member of the nuclear deal anymore ... Iran’s reaction to America’s illegal measures will be firm,” Mousavi said.Trump withdrew the United States from the Iran nuclear deal in 2018 and reimposed sanctions on Tehran that have crippled its economy.Under the deal, Iran agreed to halt its sensitive nuclear work in exchange for sanctions relief. Iran, which denies its nuclear program is aimed at building a bomb, has gradually rolled back its commitments under the accord since the United States quit. It argues that Washington’s actions justify such a course.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-says-us-push-to-extend-tehran-s-arms-embargo-is-illegitimate/story-VF8A9wE45fp74BSYOa8GTN.html
04-05-2020||World||US Supreme Court hears first case by teleconference; Thomas asks questions||In a break from tradition caused by the coronavirus pandemic, the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday for the first time heard arguments in a case by teleconference - a trademark dispute involving popular hotel reservation website Booking.com - and even typically silent Justice Clarence Thomas asked questions.The nine justices kicked off a scheduled hour of arguments in the case - not in a courtroom but by participating remotely using a dial-in format to combat the spread of the pathogen.Emphasizing the unique nature of the proceedings, Thomas, a conservative justice who almost never asks questions during arguments, embraced the new format and queried government lawyer Erica Ross about her arguments on behalf of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office seeking to prevent Booking.com from trademarking the site’s name.He asked whether trademarking a website name would be similar to trademarking a 1-800 phone number. Thomas, as the longest serving justice, asked his questions after Chief Justice John Roberts, his voice echoing on the line, asked his own questions of Ross.Early on, the technology seemed to be working well, with each justice taking turns asking questions in order of seniority.When it was Justice Stephen Breyer’s turn, he launched into his question before checking himself.“Good morning, anyway,” he said.The justices over the next two weeks are set to conduct arguments in 10 cases by teleconference. In another first, the court is providing a live audio feed, making these the first arguments that the public can hear live. Cable TV network C-SPAN said it plans to broadcast that feed in all the cases.Rather than the wide-open questioning exhibited during typical cases in the justices’ ornate courtroom, the court has tweaked the format for the teleconference arguments so justices will take turn asking questions in order of seniority.Booking.com, a unit of Norwalk, Connecticut-based Booking Holdings Inc, along with the rest of the travel industry, has been slammed by the coronavirus pandemic, which has caused tourism and business travel to evaporate worldwide.The Patent and Trademark Office is appealing a lower court decision allowing the trademark because by adding “.com” to the generic word “booking” it became eligible for a trademark. The online reservation service filed several trademark applications in 2011 and 2012.A Patent and Trademark Office tribunal in 2016 rejected those applications, saying Booking.com referred generically to the common meaning of booking lodging and transportation and cannot be used exclusively through a federal trademark registration. Under U.S. law, only terms that distinguish a particular product or service from others on the market can be trademarked.Booking.com appealed, presenting a survey that showed that 74% of consumers identified Booking.com as a brand name. The Richmond, Virginia-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sided with the company last year because the name as a whole is understood by the public to refer to a business.The court will hear arguments on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday of this week and the same days next week. The biggest cases to be considered by teleconference are three that focus on the question of whether President Donald Trump can keep his financial records including tax returns secret. Those cases will be argued on May 12.The Supreme Court building has been closed to the public since March 13 due to the pandemic. The justices have met only via teleconference, and have issued rulings only online.The coronavirus has proven to be particularly dangerous in elderly people, especially those with underlying medical issues. Three of the nine justices are over age 70: Ginsburg (87), Breyer (81) and Thomas (71).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-historic-first-us-supreme-court-to-be-broadcast-live/story-27ur18BxNf41kqS4lL5YiP.html
04-05-2020||World||US has very ‘conclusive’ report on Covid-19’s China origins, says Trump||President Donald Trump promised a “conclusive” report from the U.S. government on the Chinese origins of the coronavirus outbreak, adding that he has little doubt that Beijing misled the world about the scale and risk of the disease before it became a global pandemic.“We will be giving a very strong report on what we think happened, and I think it will be very conclusive,” Trump said during a “virtual town hall” hosted by Fox News on Sunday, after he was asked about evidence the virus is related to research conducted in a laboratory in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.“Personally, I think they made a very horrible mistake,” Trump said of the Chinese. “They tried to cover it, they tried to put it out.”The White House’s deputy national security adviser, Matt Pottinger, is scheduled to speak on the U.S. relationship with China on Monday in a webinar hosted by the University of Virginia’s Miller Center.Earlier Sunday, the Associated Press reported that U.S. officials believe China covered up the extent of the outbreak, in part, to stock up on medical supplies needed to respond to it.The president’s comments come as U.S.-China tensions climb amid the rising death toll from the virus in the U.S., which has the highest reported numbers of infections and deaths of any country, despite the outbreak first spreading more quickly in Asia and Europe. More than 67,000 people have died from the virus in the U.S. so far, out of a reported 247,000 worldwide.Earlier in the day, Secretary of State Michael Pompeo said “enormous evidence” shows the Covid-19 outbreak began in the Wuhan laboratory, but didn’t provide any proof for his claims.“I can tell you that there is a significant amount of evidence that this came from that laboratory in Wuhan,” Pompeo said on ABC’s “This Week.” “These are not the first times that we’ve had a world exposed to viruses as a result of failures in a Chinese lab.”While the Wuhan Institute of Virology was studying bat-borne coronaviruses like the one that causes Covid-19 at the time of the first known outbreak nearby, there has so far been no evidence showing it possessed the previously unknown strain. Yuan Zhiming, director of the facility’s high-security Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory, said last month that “there is absolutely no way that the virus originated from our institute.”Pompeo stopped short of saying the virus was man-made, noting that he agreed with a report by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence that ruled out genetic modification of the pathogen.“I’ve seen what the intelligence community has said,” Pompeo said. “I have no reason to believe that they’ve got it wrong.”Pompeo declined to say whether the Chinese intentionally released the virus. “I don’t have anything to say about that,” he said.‘Strong’ LeaderIn his town hall event Sunday, Trump declined to directly criticize Chinese President Xi Jinping, calling him a “strong” leader who he struck a trade deal with just as the outbreak was spreading.“I’m not going to say anything,” Trump responded when asked about Xi. “I had a very good relationship with him.”Although China has reprimanded Wuhan police for punishing doctors who sounded early warnings about the disease and replaced local officials responsible for the initial outbreak, Beijing says its response has been open and transparent. China’s foreign ministry has cited Trump’s tweets praising Xi’s handling of the outbreak as evidence of U.S. satisfaction with its response.Trump and his aides sharpened their criticism of Beijing last week, demanding answers about the virus’s origin. The president tweeted Friday that some U.S. television networks were “Chinese puppets,” while his super-political action committee unleashed anti-China ads.“China behaved like authoritarian regimes do, attempted to conceal and hide and confuse,” Pompeo said on ABC. “It employed the World Health Organization as a tool to do the same.”The secretary said China continued to block access by health experts from the WHO, as well as U.S. scientists, from getting access to samples of the virus needed for study.“This is an ongoing threat, an ongoing pandemic,” Pompeo said. “The Chinese Communist Party continues to block access to the Western world, the world’s best scientists, to figure out exactly what happened.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-says-us-has-very-conclusive-report-on-coronavirus-s-china-origins/story-7Kp8cf7g3ExSTKgzvWpVtL.html

04-05-2020||World||‘We don’t know how it will end’: Hunger stalks amid coronavirus||When all this started — when the coronavirus began stalking humanity like an animal hunting prey, when she and her husband lost their restaurant jobs overnight as the world shut down to hide, when she feared not being able to feed her family — Janeth went outside with a red kitchen towel.It was Passover. Her pastor had told her about the roots of the Jewish holiday, about Israelites smearing a lamb’s blood on their doors as a sign for the plagues to pass them by. So Janeth, an immigrant from Honduras, reached up to hang the red towel over the door of her family’s apartment on the edge of the nation’s capital. It was close enough, she figured, “to show the angel of death to pass over our home.”Pass us by, coronavirus.And pass us by, hunger.At night now, it’s the worry over food that keeps Janeth’s mind racing, and her heart, she says, hurting. “I spend hours thinking, thinking, about what we will do the next day, where we will find food the next day,” she says weeks into the coronavirus outbreak, her family’s food and cash both dwindling.Janeth and her husband, Roberto, are part of the greatest surge in unemployment in the U.S. since the Depression, setting off a wave of hunger that is swamping food programs nationwide. The couple and every adult member of their extended family in the U.S. have lost their jobs in the economic lockdown prompted by the pandemic.They are among the tens of millions in America — more than 1 out of every 6 workers — abruptly cut off from paychecks.The Associated Press is withholding the couple’s full names because they are in the country illegally and could face deportation. Their immigration status, their problems with English and scanty access to the Internet all combine to block them from accessing the U.S. government benefit programs that millions more newly jobless citizens are able to turn to during the outbreak.Before the pandemic, food policy experts say, roughly one out of every eight or nine Americans struggled to stay fed. Now as many as one out of every four are projected to join the ranks of the hungry, said Giridhar Mallya, senior policy officer at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation for public health.Immigrants, African Americans, Native Americans, households with young children and newly jobless gig workers are among those most at risk, said Joelle Johnson, senior policy associate at the Center for Science in the Public Interest.“They’re more vulnerable to begin with and this situation has just exacerbated that situation,” she said.When the global economy clamped down, Roberto, a cook in his mid-30s, and Janeth, who keeps water glasses filled at another restaurant and is in her mid-40s, spent $450 out of their final paychecks to stock up. Weeks later, their diminished cache includes two half-full five-pound bags of rice, an assortment of ramen noodles, a half-eaten bag of pasta, two boxes of cornbread mix, four boxes of raisins and cans of beans, pineapple, tuna, corn and soup.“Cookies?” Roberto and Janeth’s 5-year-old, gap-toothed daughter Allison still asks them, always getting a gentle “no” back. “Ice cream?”Janeth and Roberto have cut down to one meal a day themselves, skipping meals to keep their daughter fed.On a good day recently, after Roberto landed four hours of work preparing take-home meals for a grocery store, they had enough for what constitutes a feast these days — a can of refried beans split three ways and two eggs each, scrambled. Janeth also made tortillas from their last half-bag of masa flour.Janeth placed aluminum foil over two of the plates; she and Roberto would eat later. Tears sprang from her eyes as she watched her daughter wolf down the meal.“Where can we get enough food? How can we pay our bills?” she asked. Then she repeated something she and her husband emphasized again and again over the course of several days: They are hard-working people.“We have never had to ask for help before,” she said.Janeth and Roberto also have three adult children and, as the oldest of three sisters here, she and Roberto are trying to keep a half-dozen households in the United States and Honduras fed.By day, they race in their second-hand pickup truck from food pantries and churches to relatives’ houses. They chase tips about food giveaways or temporary jobs. They share their painstakingly acquired cartons of food with her two sisters, who themselves have a total of five young children to feed, and call their grown children with leads on food lines.And they fight off despair. “We don’t have help. We don’t know how it will end,” Janeth said.On a recent day, Janet and Roberto’s breakfast is coffee and a few crackers. Allison eats cereal, a favorite provided by a food bank.Soon after, Roberto and Allison, who is sporting pink sparkly sneakers, are among the first in line outside a DC food pantry. In line with them: a young African American man newly unemployed and seeking aid for the first time and two foreign-born nannies with their clients’ children in tow. The women now are only intermittently used — and paid — by their employers and need help feeding their own children at home.Roberto is happy to leave with a bag of bananas, some spaghetti, tomato sauce and other staples.Another day, Roberto and Allison stay inside the truck while Janeth heads out in a cold drizzle to approach a church said to be providing food. She struggles to read the sign in English posted on the door, then calls the numbers listed. No one answers.Later, loading their pickup truck to take food to Janeth’s sisters, husband and wife dip into the pockets of their jeans to display the cash they have left — $110 total.That’s gas money. Without that, living on the outskirts of town, there’s no getting to food banks, to one-day cash jobs, to stranded relatives facing eviction and hoping for food.On the drive to Janeth’s sisters in Baltimore, Janeth hands Allison a small container of applesauce. The girl savors each taste, dipping in her finger, licking every last bit. “More?” she asks hopefully, tilting the container toward her mother.Janeth answers regretfully, tenderly. No more.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/we-don-t-know-how-it-will-end-hunger-stalks-amid-coronavirus/story-ebuGmr7NTOIihJFWw4QuLM.html
04-05-2020||World||Covid-19: Italy begins to emerge from world’s longest nationwide lockdown||Stir-crazy Italians will be free to stroll and visit relatives for the first time in nine weeks on Monday as Europe’s hardest-hit country eases back the world’s longest nationwide coronavirus lockdown.Four million people -- an estimated 72 percent of them men -- will return to their construction sites and factories as the economically and emotionally shattered country tries to get back to work.Restaurants that have managed to survive Italy’s most disastrous crisis in generations will reopen for takeaway service.But bars and even ice cream parlours will remain shut. The use of public transport will be discouraged and everyone will have to wear masks in indoor public spaces.“We are feeling a mix of joy and fear,” 40-year-old Stefano Milano said in Rome.“There will be great happiness in being able to go running again carefree, in my son being allowed to have his little cousin over to blow out his birthday candles, to see our parents,” the father-of-three said.“But we are also apprehensive because they are old and my father-in-law has cancer so is high risk”. ‘Moment of responsibility’ Wuhan, the Chinese city where the virus emerged in December, led the world with an unprecedented lockdown on January 23 that lasted 76 days. Weeks later Italy followed suit, becoming the first Western democracy to shut down virtually everything in the face of an illness that has now officially killed 28,884 -- the most in Europe -- and some fear thousands more.The lives of Italians began closing in around them as it became increasingly apparent that the first batch of infections in provinces around Milan were spiralling out of control.Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte began by putting a quarter of the population in the northern industrial heartland on lockdown on March 8.The sudden measure frightened many -- fearful of being locked in together with the gathering threat -- into fleeing to less affected regions further south.The danger of the virus spreading with them and incapacitating the south’s less developed health care system forced Conte to announce a nationwide lockdown on March 9.“Today is our moment of responsibility,” Conte told the nation. “We cannot let our guard down.”The official death toll was then 724.More waves of restrictions followed as hundreds began dying each day.Almost everything except for pharmacies and grocery stores was shuttered across the Mediterranean country of 60 million on March 12.Conte’s final roll of the dice involved closing all non-essential factories on March 22.Italy’s highest single toll -- 969 -- was reported five days later. ‘Worried about reopening’ The economic toll of all those shutdowns has been historic.Italy’s economy -- the eurozone’s third-largest last year -- is expected to shrink more than in any year since the global depression of the 1930s.Half of the workforce is receiving state support and the same number told a top pollster that they were afraid of becoming unemployed.And some of those who are out of a job already say they do not entirely trust in Conte’s ability to safely navigate the nation out of peril.“I am worried about the reopening. The authorities seem very undecided about how to proceed,” 37-year-old Davide Napoleoni told AFP.Conte’s popularity has jumped along with that of most of other world leaders grappling with the pandemic thanks to a rally around the flag effect.But a Demos poll conducted at the end of April found some of Conte’s lustre fading.Confidence in his government has slipped by eight percentage points to a still-strong 63 percent since March.Psychological toll Italy’s staggered reopening is complicated by a highly decentralised system that allows the country’s 20 regions to layer on their own rules.Venice’s Veneto and the southern Calabria regions have thus been serving food and drink at bars and restaurants with outdoor seating since last week.The area around Genoa is thinking of allowing small groups of people to go sailing and reopening its beaches.Neighbouring Emilia-Romagna is keeping them closed -- even to those who live by the sea.All this uncertainty appears to be weighing on the nation’s psyche.A poll by the Piepoli Institute showed 62 percent of Italians think they will need psychological support with coming to grips with the post-lockdown world.“The night of the virus continues,” sociologist Ilvo Diamanti wrote in La Repubblica daily.“And you can hardly see the light on the horizon. If anything, we’re getting used to moving in the dark.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-italy-begins-to-emerge-from-world-s-longest-nationwide-lockdown/story-QKtOrka2Y1F4Mb5OMZsIuM.html

Johnson, 55, was rushed to St Thomas’ Hospital on April 5 when his condition had worsened a few days after he had tested positive for the coronavirus. After spending a few days in intensive care, he emerged on April 12.Recalling his near-death experience in an interview to The Sun published on Sunday, an emotional Johnson said he was administered “litres and litres” of oxygen, but ICU monitors were showing little progress, compelling doctors to make plans to announce his death.“It was a tough old moment, I won’t deny it. They had a strategy to deal with a death-of-Stalin type scenario. I was not in particularly brilliant shape and I was aware there were contingency plans in place. The doctors had all sorts of arrangements for what to do if things went wrong.“It was hard to believe that in just a few days, my health had deteriorated to this extent... The bad moment came when it was 50-50 whether they were going to have to put a tube down my windpipe. That was when it got a bit... they were starting to think about how to handle it presentationally.”The report said the UK PM’s voice faltered and eyes reddened during the interview in Downing Street. “I’ve broken my nose, I’ve broken my finger, I’ve broken my wrist, I’ve broken my rib. I’ve broken just about everything. I’ve broken all sorts of things. But I’ve never had anything as serious as this,” he said. “The indicators kept going in the wrong direction and I thought, ‘There’s no medicine for this thing and there’s no cure’. That was the stage when I was thinking, ‘How am I going to get out of this?’”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/docs-prepared-to-announce-my-death-recalls-boris-johnson/story-CF4FOlfruXwxseZOvPJBTI.html

Canada is part of the intelligence alliance Five Eyes, which has blamed China for the coronavirus outbreak. Trudeau’s comment came during a daily media briefing in Ottawa hours after multiple global media organisations put out reports based on a leaked intelligence dossier that blamed China for hiding and even destroying evidence of the coronavirus pandemic, thus contributing to its worldwide spread. The 15-page dossier came from the Five Eyes intelligence bloc, comprising the United States, Canada, England, New Zealand and Australia.However, Trudeau was circumspect when addressing the matter as he said “it is still early to draw firm conclusions and indeed our focus remains on how we are working to protect Canadians.”He did indicate that intelligence gathering and investigation in this respect was ongoing, as he said, “We will continue to work with intelligence agencies around the world, not just the Five Eyes but friends and partners as well and look to find answers to the many questions people are asking.” Trudeau’s remarks preceded a comment from US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that there is “enormous evidence” the virus leaked from a virology laboratory in Wuhan.The Canadian PM has been similarly guarded on this matter even earlier when US President Donald Trump had charged China with allowing the virus to proliferate.However, one of Trudeau’s Cabinet colleagues, Health Minister Patty Hadju, had earlier dismissed questions about China potentially fudging Covid-19 figures, as part of “conspiracy theories” on the Internet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/too-early-for-firm-conclusions-canada-pm-trudeau-on-allegations-against-china-on-spread-of-covid-19/story-9LDBEbhWxT1g75aqEMrVQL.html
04-05-2020||World||Trump hits out at Bush for failing to support him during impeachment||US President Donald Trump on Sunday struck out at former president George W. Bush in a video called for compassion and solidarity over the coronavirus pandemic.Bush -- like Trump, a member of the Republican Party -- drew a parallel between the Covid-19 crisis and the September 11, 2001 attack in a clip posted Saturday by the George W. Bush Presidential Center.The Al-Qaeda led terror attacks took place just months after Bush arrived in the White House.“Following 9/11 I saw a great nation rise as one to honor the brave, to grieve with the grieving, and to embrace unavoidable new duties,” Bush said, with archive images playing in the background.Bush, 73, said he was convinced that the “spirit of sacrifice” has not disappeared, and called for compassion as the United States struggles to quell the novel coronavirus.“Let us remember how small our differences are in the face of this shared threat,” said Bush. “In the final analysis we are not partisan combatants, we are human beings.”Bush added that Americans should “remember that empathy and simple kindness are essential, powerful tools of national recovery.”As someone who is regularly criticized for his lack of empathy, Trump may have felt targeted.Early Sunday, Trump responded, by apparently quoting a co-anchor from the “Fox and Friends” show on Fox News.“Oh bye the way, I appreciate the message from former President Bush, but where was he during Impeachment calling for putting partisanship aside,” Trump wrote, quoting the co-anchor.Trump then added in his own voice: “He was nowhere to be found in speaking up against the greatest Hoax in American history!”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-hits-out-at-bush-for-failing-to-support-him-during-impeachment/story-xd1gGXukfUHIquqBmXtxjP.html

Nevertheless, the tougher border controls introduced by France in mid-March to limit coronavirus contagion, particularly at the border with Germany, will continue, the interior ministry told AFP. “The travel restrictions currently in place at our borders will continue to apply,” the ministry said. “Nothing has changed.” The number of new deaths from Covid-19 in France has been declining in recent days, with 135 fatalities reported over the past 24 hours on Sunday. The national health service said the increase brought France’s total death toll to 24,895, the world’s fifth highest figure after the United States, Italy, Britain and Spain.The last time the number of daily reported deaths was below 135 was on March 22, when it represented only those reported by hospitals.The current figure also includes deaths reported by elderly care homes and other medicalised care facilities.France plans to start lifting the coronavirus lockdown from May 11, when children are to return to school in stages, some businesses will reopen and people will be able to travel within 100 kilometres (60 miles) of their homes without a signed justification for their movement.But Health Minister Olivier Veran warned Sunday that this would depend on further declines in Covid-19 infections, especially in hard-hit areas like the Paris region and northeast France.The government has said the number of new coronavirus cases must stabilise at fewer than 3,000 per day as it expands testing, otherwise doctors and nurses could face another wave of patients that have tested hospitals since March.“If the number of new cases proves too high, we’ll have to reconsider the date for lifting the lockdown, and decide according to the situation in each department,” Veran told the Journal du Dimanche newspaper.He also cautioned against planning summer holidays for now, saying “it’s unlikely that this virus is going to go on vacation”.Officials are scrambling to ramp up testing capacities to 700,000 people each week by May 11, which health experts say is essential for containing the outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-says-won-t-quarantine-eu-schengen-area-citizens/story-roGtGHKjEVKGLFcA4WNDIK.html
04-05-2020||World||‘Extend Covid-19 emergency benefits to international students’: An appeal to Canadian PM||A leading Indo-Canadian organisation has written to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, appealing to him to extend emergency benefits announced during the Covid-19 pandemic to international students, including nearly 200000 from India.Students from India comprise the largest contingent from abroad in Canada, with over 2 lakh from among the nearly 6.5 lakh. However, a large number of them have been stranded in Canada after restrictive measures were announced in March and colleges and universities closed while returning to India was not an option due to the lockdown in their home country.However, the Canada Emergency Student Benefits programme or CESB, announced by Trudeau last month, is targeted at Canadian students, meaning citizens and permanent residents. Canada India Foundation or CIF, a leading community group, has expressed its “dismay” over the exclusion of international students from within the purview of the programme, in a letter sent to Trudeau.“The federal government must include international students to come under the ambit of the CESB because their circumstances are materially not different from those of local students,” CIF chair Anil Shah said. The support announced will run from May to August and will provide CA $ 1250 to post-secondary students and recent graduates, with that amount increasing by CA$ 500 for those with dependents or those with disabilities.However, Indian students may be suffering from neglect since they can no longer earn any income as many retail establishments are closed. Such students are allowed to work for 20 hours a week to support themselves. “There is no way out because they can’t return home,” CIF stated in the letter.The number of Indian students coming to Canada has increased in recent years, at almost 350 per cent over the figure for 2014.Satish Thakkar, CIF’s national convener said, “Financial contribution of international students in Canadian economy around $22 billion, and it supports over 170,000 Canadian jobs, by supporting them at this very critical time will encourage future flow of international students from all over the world.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/extend-covid-19-emergency-benefits-to-international-students-an-appeal-to-canadian-pm/story-bs6EoGzm7q6teVktLpgGGO.html
04-05-2020||World||‘Enormous evidence’ coronavirus came from China lab: Mike Pompeo||US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Sunday said “enormous evidence” showed the new coronavirus originated in a lab in China, further fueling tensions with Beijing over its handling of the outbreak.Pompeo’s comments came as Europe and parts of the United States prepared to cautiously lift virus lockdowns as signs emerge that the deadly pandemic is ebbing and governments look to restart their battered economies.More than 245,000 people have been killed and 3.4 million infected worldwide by the virus, which has left half of humanity under some form of lockdown and pushed the global economy towards its worst downturn since the Great Depression.US President Donald Trump, increasingly critical of China’s management of the first outbreak in the city of Wuhan in December, claims to have proof it started in a Chinese laboratory. Scientists believe the virus jumped from animals to humans, after emerging in China, possibly from a market in Wuhan selling exotic animals for meat.‘History of infecting the world’ China denies the claims, and the US Director of National Intelligence office has said analysts are still examining the exact origin of the outbreak.Pompeo, a former CIA chief, told the ABC he agreed that the Covid-19 virus was not man-made.But Pompeo went further than Trump, citing “enormous” evidence that the virus originated in a Wuhan lab. He did not however present evidence to back up his claim.“I think the whole world can see now, remember, China has a history of infecting the world and running substandard laboratories,” he said.Pompeo said early Chinese efforts to downplay the coronavirus amounted to “a classic Communist disinformation effort. That created enormous risk.”“President Trump is very clear: we’ll hold those responsible accountable.”Pressure from demonstratorsUS news reports say Trump has tasked US spies to find out more about the origins of the virus, as he makes China’s handling of the pandemic a centerpiece of his campaign for the November presidential election.The United States has the most coronavirus deaths in the world at more 67,600, with 1,450 recorded over the 24-hours late Sunday.Trump, speaking at a live TV event, promised an early coronavirus vaccine and an “incredible” future for the country as he sought to relaunch his disrupted election campaign.Florida is set to ease its lockdown Monday, as other US states wrestle with pressure from demonstrators -- some carrying weapons -- who have rallied against the restrictions.In New York, the epicenter of the US outbreak, an emergency field hospital erected in Central Park is set to close as virus cases decline.But dozens of New Yorkers were fined for violating social distancing guidelines as they flocked to beaches and parks in balmy weekend weather.In Brazil, President Jair Bolsonaro railed against the country’s lockdown in a speech to thousands of anti-confinement demonstrators, even as the national death toll rose above 7,000.‘Rules are not clear’ Across the Atlantic, European nations prepared for cautious easing of restrictions.Hard-hit Italy -- which reported its lowest daily toll since stay-at-home orders were imposed on March 10 -- is set to follow Spain in allowing people outside.Starting Monday Italians will be allowed to stroll in parks and visit relatives. Restaurants can open for takeaways and wholesale stores can resume business, but there was some confusion over the rules.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageRomans were doing aerobics on rooftop terraces and exercising indoors while squares in the city center were mostly empty on the last day that Italians were obliged to remain within 200 meters of their homes.“On the one hand, we’re super excited for the reopening, we’re already organizing various activities the kids will be able to do with their grandparents outdoors,” said Rome resident Marghe Lodoli, who has three children.“On the other hand, it’s disorientating. The rules are not clear, and we’re not sure if just using common sense will do.”Italian authorities have said some preventative measures are still needed in a country that has the second-highest number of virus deaths.In another sign of life returning, an influential German minister said Sunday he supports a resumption of the country’s football season this month as long as teams respect hygiene conditions.The British government said the easing of coronavirus lockdown measures was likely to be gradual, as it announced a further rise in the overall death toll.Most governments are sticking to measures to control the spread of the virus -- social distancing and masks in public -- and more testing to try to track infections even as they relax curbs.Even as some European countries gradually lift restrictions, officials in Moscow -- the epicenter of the contagion in Russia -- urged residents to stay home.With cases increasing by several thousand each day, Russia is now the European country registering the most new infections.Prepare for ‘bad scenarios’ European leaders are backing an initiative from Brussels to raise 7.5 billion euros ($8.3 billion) to tackle the pandemic and raise funds for efforts to find a vaccine for Covid-19, the disease caused by coronavirus.The race is on to find a viable vaccine or treatment with several countries involved in trials.In Asia, South Korea -- once the second worst-hit nation on the planet -- said Sunday it would ease a ban on some gatherings and events as long as they “follow disinfection measures.”Thailand allowed businesses such as restaurants, hair salons and outdoor markets to reopen so long as social distancing was maintained and temperature checks carried out.But experts caution that many countries are still not through the worst.The Philippines suspended all flights into and out of the country in a bid to ease pressure on its congested quarantine facilities.Iranian President Hassan Rouhani announced that mosques would reopen across large parts of the Islamic Republic, after they were closed in early March to try to contain the Middle East’s deadliest Covid-19 outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/enormous-evidence-coronavirus-came-from-china-lab-mike-pompeo/story-3MjmTDPiXaTu40pCahIbQJ.html
04-05-2020||World||Covid-19: Trump pushes for reopening US economy in televised town hall||Anxious for an economic recovery, President Donald Trump fielded Americans’ questions about decisions by some states to allow non-essential businesses to reopen while other states are on virtual lockdown due to the coronavirus.After more than a month of being cooped up at the White House, Trump returned from a weekend at the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland and participated in a “virtual” town hall, hosted Sunday night by Fox News Channel, from inside the Lincoln Memorial. He pushed for an economic reopening, one his advisers believe will be essential for his reelection chances this November.“We have to get it back open safely but as quickly as possible,” Trump said.The president acknowledged fear on both sides of the issue, some Americans worried about getting sick while others are concerned about losing jobs. Though the administration’s handling of the pandemic, particularly its ability to conduct widespread testing, has come under fierce scrutiny, the president defended the response and said the nation was ready to begin reopening.“I’ll tell you one thing. We did the right thing and I really believe we saved a million and a half lives,” the president said. But he also broke with the assessment of his senior adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, saying it was “too soon to say” if the federal government was overseeing a “success story.”Trump’s impatience also flashed. While noting that states would go at their own pace in returning to normal, with ones harder hit by the coronavirus going slower, he said that “some states frankly I think aren’t going fast enough” and singled out Virginia, which has a Democratic governor and legislature. And he urged the nation’s schools and universities to return to classes this fall.But many public health experts believe that cannot be done safely until a vaccine is developed. Trump declared Sunday that he believed one could be available by year’s end although his own pandemic task force has predicated it could be another 18 months.Federal guidelines that encouraged people to stay at home and practice social distancing expired late last week.Debate continued over moves by governors to start reopening state economies that tanked after shopping malls, salons and other nonessential businesses were ordered closed in attempt to slow a virus that has killed more than 66,000 Americans, according to a tally of reported deaths by Johns Hopkins University.The U.S. economy has suffered, shrinking at a 4.8% annual rate from January through March, the government estimated last week. It was the sharpest quarterly drop since the 2008 financial crisis.Roughly 30.3 million people have filed for unemployment aid in the six weeks since the outbreak forced employers to shut down and slash their workforces. It was the worst string of layoffs on record.Larry Kudlow, Trump’s top economic adviser, on Sunday predicted a “spectacular 2021” — with “the right set of policies” — on top of a rebound from July through December of this year. He said on CNN’s “State of the Union” that the administration would “pause” to review the effectiveness of trillions in economic relief spending before making any decision on whether additional aid is needed. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Thursday that state and local governments are seeking up to $1 trillion for coronavirus costs,The Senate planned to reopen Monday, despite the Washington area’s continued status as a virus hot spot and with the region still under stay-at-home orders. The House remains shuttered. The pandemic is forcing big changes at the tradition-bound Supreme Court: The justices will hear arguments, beginning Monday, by telephone for the first time since Alexander Graham Bell patented his invention in 1876.Congressional Republicans are resisting calls by Democrats for emergency spending for states and local governments whose revenue streams all but dried up in recent weeks. The GOP is counting on the country’s reopening and the rebound promised by Trump as their best hope to forestall another big round of virus aid.The leaders of California and Michigan are among governors under public pressure over lockdowns still in effect while states such as Florida, Georgia and Ohio are reopening.Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, said Sunday that the armed protesters who demonstrated inside her state’s Capitol “depicted some of the worst racism” and “awful parts” of U.S. history by showing up with Confederate flags, nooses and swastikas.Trump had tweeted “LIBERATE” and named Michigan and other states in mid-April. In a new tweet Friday, he urged Whitmer to “make a deal” with the protesters. “These are very good people, but they are angry. They want their lives back again, safely!” Trump said.Despite the opposition of Michigan’s Republican-controlled Legislature, Whitmer has extended a state of emergency declaration and directed most businesses statewide to remain closed.Some people participating in other public protests across the U.S. have not kept their distance from one another and have rallied without masks, not heeding public health recommendations.Dr. Deborah Birx, coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, called that behavior “devastatingly worrisome.” She said people will feel guilty for the rest of their lives if they end up infected and unwittingly spread the virus to vulnerable family members.“We need to protect each other at the same time we’re voice our discontent,” she told CNN’s “State of the Union.”An overwhelming majority of Americans support stay-at-home orders and other efforts to slow the virus’ spread, according to a recent survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.Asked about states that are reopening before they meet benchmarks laid out in federal guidelines she helped write, Birx said the guidelines “are a pretty firm policy of what we think is important from a public health standpoint.” She added that she and others have made it clear that people must continue practicing social distancing, “scrupulous” hand washing and other measures to protect themselves and others.Fox News Channel said it asked viewers to submit questions about reopening the country on the network’s Twitter, Facebook and Instagram accounts for a chance to appear on the rare broadcast from the Lincoln Memorial. Trump spoke from the memorial’s steps last July Fourth. It’s also where Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his “I have a dream” speech in 1963. Trump recently compared his Independence Day audience to King’s.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-trump-pushes-for-reopening-us-economy-in-televised-town-hall/story-jYGksdAGbjoFFaUoHPu7CM.html
04-05-2020||World||NYPD cop stripped of gun, badge for violently arresting man for social distancing violation||A New York City police officer who was caught on video Saturday pointing a stun gun at a man and violently taking him to the ground over an alleged social distancing violation has been stripped of his gun and badge and placed on desk duty pending an internal investigation.Bystander video showed the plainclothes officer, who was not wearing a protective face mask, slapping 33-year-old Donni Wright in the face, punching him in the shoulder and dragging him to a sidewalk after leveling him in a crosswalk in Manhattan’s East Village.“The behavior I saw in that video is simply not acceptable,” Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted Sunday. He said earlier in the day that there will be a careful look into what happened.Police spokeswoman Sgt. Mary Frances O’Donnell said Wright “took a fighting stance against the officer” when he was ordered to disperse and was arrested on charges including assault on a police officer and resisting arrest.The charges have been deferred pending further investigation, a Manhattan District Attorney’s Office spokesperson said.A message seeking comment was left with the police officers union.Wright’s arrest and that of two other people minutes earlier on the same block across from a public housing complex raised new questions about the police department’s use of force, the role of officers in enforcing social distancing measures and inconsistency in how they’re applied.The manner of Wright’s arrest appeared to echo that of 20-year-old Fitzroy Gayle, who was seen on bystander video pleading for help as several officers wrestled him into submission on a Brooklyn sidewalk in early March.Jennvine Wong, a lawyer with the Legal Aid Society’s Cop Accountability Project, said footage of the arrests Saturday stood in sharp contrast to photos and video — including some tweeted out by the police department — showing officers in crowded city parks handing out face masks and gently reminding people to stay 6 feet apart.“This certainly isn’t the first time and this isn’t even the first time in this pandemic that we’ve seen evidence of discriminatory policing by the NYPD,” Wong said.Carolyn Martinez-Class, of the police watchdog Communities United for Police Reform, said: “This incident illustrates why public health professions and community partners should be responsible for social distancing education and creating norms — not police.”The police department assigned 1,000 officers to social distancing patrols over the weekend as temperatures reached the high 70s (about 25 degrees Celsius). On Saturday, they issued 51 summonses, including 43 in city parks. At a news conference Sunday, Shea said he was aware of just three arrests.Minutes before the confrontation with Wright, video from a nearby security camera showed officers used force in arresting a couple for allegedly failing to comply when asked to disperse. O’Donnell said officers saw that one of them, a 31-year-old man, had a “bag of alleged marijuana in plain view.”The bystander video of Wright’s arrest showed the plainclothes officer, Francisco Garcia, helping take one of those people to the ground before turning his attention to Wright, who was moving toward the area of that arrest from about 10 to 15 feet away.Garcia — in a black T-shirt, jeans and a Yankees cap — turned toward Wright and cursed at him to “(get) back right now,” according to the video. At the same time, the officer pulls up his Taser and points it toward Wright, possibly triggering the device.Garcia continued toward Wright and eventually holstered his Taser. It wasn’t clear what Wright was doing because he wasn’t in the frame the entire time, though just before Garcia tackled him, he was seen stopping and standing in front of the officer with what appeared to be a clenched fist at his side.“What you flexing for? Don’t flex,” Garcia said, before grabbing Wright and wrestling him to the ground, slapping and punching him in the process. The officer then took Wright’s arm and dragged him from the crosswalk where he landed back onto the sidewalk and pushed him onto his stomach.The video then showed another officer stepping in and helping handcuff Wright.Kneeling on the top of Wright’s back or neck to keep him down, the plainclothes officer started jawing and cursing at bystanders.One of them yelled back: “he didn’t even do nothing.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nypd-cop-stripped-of-gun-badge-for-violently-arresting-man-for-social-distancing-violation/story-jyv2arqMDnGO9bLfTNS7AM.html
04-05-2020||World||China hid extent and severity of coronavirus’ outbreak to hoard medical supplies: US Report||U.S. officials believe China covered up the extent of the coronavirus outbreak — and how contagious the disease is — to stock up on medical supplies needed to respond to it, intelligence documents show.Chinese leaders “intentionally concealed the severity” of the pandemic from the world in early January, according to a four-page Department of Homeland Security intelligence report dated May 1 and obtained by The Associated Press. The revelation comes as the Trump administration has intensified its criticism of China, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo saying Sunday that country was responsible for the spread of disease and must be held accountable.The sharper rhetoric coincides with administration critics saying the government’s response to the virus was slow and inadequate. President Donald Trump’s political opponents have accused him of lashing out at China, a geopolitical foe but critical U.S. trade partner, in an attempt to deflect criticism at home.Not classified but marked “for official use only,” the DHS analysis states that, while downplaying the severity of the coronavirus, China increased imports and decreased exports of medical supplies. It attempted to cover up doing so by “denying there were export restrictions and obfuscating and delaying provision of its trade data,” the analysis states.The report also says China held off informing the World Health Organization that the coronavirus “was a contagion” for much of January so it could order medical supplies from abroad — and that its imports of face masks and surgical gowns and gloves increased sharply.Those conclusions are based on the 95% probability that China’s changes in imports and export behavior were not within normal range, according to the report.In a tweet on Sunday, the president appeared to blame U.S. intelligence officials for not making clearer sooner just how dangerous a potential coronavirus outbreak could be. Trump has been defensive over whether he failed to act after receiving early warnings from intelligence officials and others about the coronavirus and its potential impact.“Intelligence has just reported to me that I was correct, and that they did NOT bring up the CoronaVirus subject matter until late into January, just prior to my banning China from the U.S.,” Trump wrote without citing specifics. “Also, they only spoke of the Virus in a very non-threatening, or matter of fact, manner.”Trump had previously speculated that China may have unleashed the coronavirus due to some kind of horrible “mistake.” His intelligence agencies say they are still examining a notion put forward by the president and aides that the pandemic may have resulted from an accident at a Chinese lab.Speaking Sunday on ABC’s “This Week,” Pompeo said he had no reason to believe that the virus was deliberately spread. But he added, “Remember, China has a history of infecting the world, and they have a history of running substandard laboratories.”“These are not the first times that we’ve had a world exposed to viruses as a result of failures in a Chinese lab,” Pompeo said. “And so, while the intelligence community continues to do its work, they should continue to do that, and verify so that we are certain, I can tell you that there is a significant amount of evidence that this came from that laboratory in Wuhan.”The secretary of state appeared to be referring to previous outbreaks of respiratory viruses, like SARS, which started in China. His remark may be seen as offensive in China. Still, Pompeo repeated the same assertion hours later, via a tweet Sunday afternoon.Speaking Sunday on Fox News Channel’s “Sunday Morning Futures,” Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, echoed that sentiment, saying he believes China “is the most significant geopolitical threat to the United States for the next century.”“The communist government in China bears enormous responsibility, enormous direct culpability for this pandemic. We know they covered it up,” Cruz said. “Had they behaved responsibly and sent in health professionals and quarantined those infected, there’s a real possibility this could have been a regional outbreak, and not a global pandemic. And the hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide are in a very real sense the direct responsibility of the communist Chinese government’s lies.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-hid-extent-and-severity-of-coronavirus-outbreak-to-hoard-medical-supplies-us-report/story-JvAUcEsWWBzyW5qkHhsaOI.html
04-05-2020||World||Trump leadership void on South Asia persists as diplomat retires||The acting top US diplomat for South Asia announced her retirement Sunday, as President Donald Trump looks increasingly likely to go a full term without a Senate-confirmed State Department official focused on the subcontinent.Alice Wells, a career diplomat who has served as acting assistant secretary of state for South and Central Asia for most of the Trump administration, will retire in May after a 31-year career, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said.“I will miss Alice’s wise counsel and dedicated efforts to build relationships and address challenges across South and Central Asia,” Pompeo wrote on Twitter.Trump has called for a close relationship with India and has bonded with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, including on a visit to the country in February.But under Trump, South and Central Asia has been the only region of the world yet to have a full-fledged assistant secretary of state confirmed by the Senate.With six months to go before presidential elections and all eyes on the coronavirus crisis, the chances look slim that an assistant secretary will be nominated and confirmed by the Senate soon.The administration put forward one person for the job, veteran intelligence official Robert Williams, but he withdrew his nomination in April 2019, citing personal reasons.Wells, despite not having the authority of a presidential nomination and Senate confirmation, has been active in promoting a closer US relationship with India.She nonetheless made headlines last year when she called on India to restore internet access and free political leaders in Kashmir Valley -- a rare statement of concern over India’s rights record, following pressure from the US Congress.Also last year, she made an unusually detailed case for Pakistan to be wary about a major infrastructure push by China.Wells’ departure also comes as the United States begins to pull troops from Afghanistan to end its longest-ever war, although a special US envoy, Zalmay Khalilzad, is in charge of negotiating with the Taliban.Wells focused earlier in her career on Russia and served under former president Barack Obama as ambassador to Jordan. Trump pulled her from Amman as his administration reshaped priorities in the Middle East.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-leadership-void-on-south-asia-persists-as-diplomat-retires/story-F1wWO2UQc1KAdpjv2OLAVI.html

04-05-2020||World||Coronavirus origin: Mike Pompeo points at Wuhan lab||US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo has said that “enormous evidence” shows that the coronavirus outbreak began in a laboratory in Wuhan, China. He didn’t provide any proof for his claims, though.“I can tell you that there is a significant amount of evidence that this came from that laboratory in Wuhan,” Pompeo said on ABC’s This Week. “These are not the first times that we’ve had a world exposed to viruses as a result of failures in a Chinese lab.”Pompeo stopped short of saying the virus was man-made, saying that he agreed with a report by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence that ruled out genetic modification.“I’ve seen what the intelligence community has said,” said Pompeo. “I have no reason to believe that they’ve got it wrong.”Meanwhile, prisons in the US that hold the world’s largest number of incarcerated people have been tormented by a wave of coronavirus infections and fatalities.More than 14,400 inmates have been infected and some 215 have died, said Marshall Project, a non-partisan news organisation. Official numbers from the Bureau of Prions showed 1,919 cases and 37 fatalities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-origin-mike-pompeo-points-at-wuhan-lab/story-jTgRenxJlUhSt5XNmT0jbM.html
04-05-2020||World||At Lincoln Memorial, Donald Trump to take public’s pandemic queries||Anxious for an economic recovery, President Donald Trump prepared to field Americans’ questions about decisions by some states to allow nonessential businesses to reopen while other states are on virtual lockdown due to the coronavirus.After more than a month of being cooped up at the White House, Trump was returning from a weekend at the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland and planned to participate in a “virtual” town hall, hosted Sunday night by Fox News Channel, from inside the Lincoln Memorial.“Hopefully our Country will soon mend,” Trump tweeted. Federal guidelines that encouraged people to stay at home and practice social distancing expired late last week.Debate continued over moves by governors to start reopening state economies that tanked after shopping malls, salons and other nonessential businesses were ordered closed in attempt to slow a virus that has killed more than 66,000 Americans, according to a tally of reported deaths by Johns Hopkins University.The U.S. economy has suffered, shrinking at a 4.8% annual rate from January through March, the government estimated last week. It was the sharpest quarterly drop since the 2008 financial crisis.Roughly 30.3 million people have filed for unemployment aid in the six weeks since the outbreak forced employers to shut down and slash their workforces. It was the worst string of layoffs on record.Trump has made it clear that he wants the country reopened.“I like the states opening. They will be opening,” the president said Friday as he left the White House for Camp David. “They’re going to open safely and quickly, I hope, because we have to get our country back.”Larry Kudlow, Trump’s top economic adviser, on Sunday predicted a “spectacular 2021” — with “the right set of policies” — on top of a rebound from July through December of this year. He said on CNN’s “State of the Union” that the administration would “pause” to review the effectiveness of trillions in economic relief spending before making any decision on whether additional aid is needed. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Thursday that state and local governments are seeking up to $1 trillion for coronavirus costs,The Senate planned to reopen Monday, despite the Washington area’s continued status as a virus hot spot and with the region still under stay-at-home orders. The House remains shuttered. The pandemic is forcing big changes at the tradition-bound Supreme Court: The justices will hear arguments, beginning Monday, by telephone for the first time since Alexander Graham Bell patented his invention in 1876.Congressional Republicans are resisting calls by Democrats for emergency spending for states and local governments whose revenue streams all but dried up in recent weeks. The GOP is counting on the country’s reopening and an the rebound promised by Trump as their best hope to forestall another big round of virus aid.Fox News Channel said viewers were asked to submit questions about reopening the country to the network’s accounts on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram for a chance to appear on the national broadcast.Trump participated in a similar event sponsored by Fox News on March 5 in Scranton, Pennsylvania.Kayleigh McEnancy, the new White House press secretary, closed her first formal briefing on Friday by promising the town hall will be “ can’t-miss television.”___Follow Darlene Superville on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/dsupervilleap||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-lincoln-memorial-donald-trump-to-take-public-s-pandemic-queries/story-wHuloOg4RQI9SoKXjoVrKI.html
04-05-2020||World||US says ‘evidence’ virus came from China lab as Europe eases lockdown||US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Sunday said “enormous evidence” showed the new coronavirus originated in a lab in China, further fueling tensions with Beijing over its handling of the outbreak.Pompeo’s comments came as Europe and parts of the United States prepared to cautiously lift virus lockdowns as signs emerge that the deadly pandemic is ebbing and governments look to restart their battered economies.More than 243,000 people have been killed and 3.4 million infected worldwide by the virus, which has left half of humanity under some form of lockdown and pushed the global economy towards its worst downturn since the Great Depression.US President Donald Trump, increasingly critical of China’s management of the first outbreak in the city of Wuhan in December, last week claimed to have proof it started in a Chinese laboratory. Scientists believe the virus jumped from animals to humans, after emerging in China, possibly from a market in Wuhan selling exotic animals for meat.Trump, without giving details, said Thursday he had seen evidence the Wuhan Institute of Virology was the source, appearing to echo speculation fueled by US right-wing radio commentators about a secret lab.- ‘History of infecting the world’ -China denies the claims and even the US Director of National Intelligence office has said analysts are still examining the exact origin of the outbreak.Pompeo, a former CIA chief, told the ABC he agreed with a statement from the US intelligence community about the “wide scientific consensus that the COVID-19 virus was not man-made or genetically modified.”But Pompeo went further than Trump, citing “significant” and “enormous” evidence that the virus originated in a Wuhan lab.“I think the whole world can see now, remember, China has a history of infecting the world and running substandard laboratories.”Pompeo said early Chinese efforts to downplay the coronavirus amounted to “a classic Communist disinformation effort. That created enormous risk.”“President Trump is very clear: we’ll hold those responsible accountable.”- Pressure from demonstrators -US news reports say Trump has tasked US spies to find out more about the origins of the virus, as he makes China’s handling of the pandemic a centerpiece of his campaign for the November presidential election.The United States has the most coronavirus deaths in the world at more 66,000 and Trump is keen for a turnaround to help reduce the economic pain, with tens of millions left jobless.Florida is set to ease its lockdown Monday, as other states wrestle with pressure from demonstrators -- some armed -- who have rallied against the restrictions.There are signs the pandemic is slowing in some parts of the United States.In New York, the epicenter of the US outbreak, an emergency field hospital erected in Central Park is set to close as virus cases decline.- ‘Rules are not clear’ -Across the Atlantic, European nations prepared for cautious easing of restrictions.Hard-hit Italy -- which reported its lowest daily toll since stay-at-home orders were imposed on March 10 -- is set to follow Spain in allowing people outside.Italians from Monday will be allowed to stroll in parks and visit relatives. Restaurants can open for takeaways and wholesale stores can resume business, but there was some confusion over the rules.Romans were doing aerobics on rooftop terraces and exercising indoors while squares in the city centre were mostly empty on the last day Italians were obliged to remain within 200 meters of their homes.“On the one hand, we’re super excited for the reopening, we’re already organizing various activities the kids will be able to do with their grandparents outdoors,” said Rome resident Marghe Lodoli, who has three children.“On the other hand, it’s disorientating. The rules are not clear, and we’re not sure if just using common sense will do.”Italian authorities have said some preventative measures are still needed in a country that has the second-highest number of virus deaths.Elsewhere, Germany will continue its easing Monday, while Slovenia, Poland and Hungary will allow public spaces and businesses to partially reopen.In another sign of life returning, an influential German minister said Sunday he supports a resumption of the country’s football season this month as long as teams respect hygiene conditions.The British government will unveil its own “roadmap” to ease the lockdown this week, after Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the country was “past the peak” of the outbreak.But with health experts warning the disease could hit hard once again, governments are trying to balance easing restrictions to revive businesses against the risk of fresh outbreaks.Most governments are sticking to measures to control the spread of the virus - social distancing and masks in public -- and more testing to try to track infections even as they relax curbs.Face masks will be mandatory on public transport starting Monday in Spain, where people were allowed to go outdoors to exercise and walk freely Saturday after a 48-day lockdown.Even as some European countries gradually lift restrictions, officials in Moscow -- the epicenter of the contagion in Russia -- urged residents to stay home.With cases increasing by several thousand each day, Russia is now the European country registering the most new infections.- Prepare for ‘bad scenarios’ - European leaders are backing an initiative from Brussels to raise 7.5 billion euros ($8.3 billion) to tackle the pandemic and raise funds for efforts to find a vaccine for COVID-19, the disease caused by coronavirus.The race is on to find a viable vaccine or treatment with several countries involved in trials.In Asia, South Korea -- once the second worst-hit nation on the planet -- said Sunday it would ease a ban on some gatherings and events as long as they “follow disinfection measures”.Thailand allowed businesses such as restaurants, hair salons and outdoor markets to reopen so long as social distancing was maintained and temperature checks carried out.But experts caution that many countries are still not through the worst.The Philippines suspended all flights into and out of the country for a week starting Sunday in a bid to ease pressure on its congested quarantine facilities.Iranian President Hassan Rouhani announced mosques would reopen across large parts of the Islamic Republic, after they were closed in early March to try to contain the Middle East’s deadliest COVID-19 outbreak.Rouhani warned, however, that while Iran would reopen “calmly and gradually”, it should also prepare for “bad scenarios”.burs-pm/txw||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-says-evidence-virus-came-from-china-lab-as-europe-eases-lockdown/story-OI5e4IN9aslu5NoJDgWiEP.html

The Opposition Congress termed her resignation ‘shocking’, asking Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar if it was not a “proof of his failure”. Rani Nagar (35) currently held the charge of the director, Archives Department; and the additional director, social justice and empowerment. Recently, Nagar had posted on her Facebook page that she will resign after the coronavirus lockdown was lifted. She sent her resignation to state chief secretary Keshni Anand Arora, requesting her to forward it to a competent authority in the Union government. The letter has been received at the chief secretary’s office, an official said. However, Nagar did not elaborate on what she meant by the reason of her resignation. The officer could not be contacted over the phone. Nagar has also sent copies of the resignation to the president, prime minister, Haryana governor and the chief minister through e-mail. “The reason for submitting this resignation is the personal safety on government duty,” she said in a letter to the chief secretary. “I do hereby most humbly submit to you my resignation from the post of Indian Administrative Service with immediate effect, that is effective from May 4, 2020, forenoon,” she wrote. The letter was also posted on her Facebook page. She later left Chandigarh for her hometown Ghaziabad with her sister. She posted on her Facebook page that she had taken permission to move out of the city. Commenting on it, Congress’ chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala termed her resignation “a shocking incident”. Hitting out at the BJP-JJP government in the state, Surjewala said, “A senior woman IAS officer has given her resignation stating that she feels unsafe.” “If a woman IAS officer resigns on the grounds citing personal safety on government duty as the reason, then who will safe in Haryana. Is this not no confidence in your government, is this not a living proof of your failure,” Surjewala said hitting out at the chief minister. Nagar had come into limelight in June 2018, when she accused an additional chief secretary-level bureaucrat of harassing her. The state government had conducted an inquiry into the allegations, but the charges did not hold against the officer, a senior official said on Monday. In an earlier post on her Facebook page, Nagar, who was living in the UT guest house of Chandigarh since 2018 along with her sister, had claimed that despite numerous complaints against the senior bureaucrat, no action was taken against him. Nagar had mentioned that last year, she had lodged a complaint against the bureaucrat before a court and claimed there is a constant threat to “our lives” (she and her sister), while requesting her Facebook friends to report the matter to the court, if they go untraceable. In December 2017, when she was posted as the subdivisional magistrate of Dabawali in Sirsa district, police had lodged a case of tresspass against an unidentified person on her complaint. Nagar had then posted a video on her Facebook page, alleging that police “failed to initiate a prompt action” on her compliant.

According to the Central government’s new guidelines, only those migrants stranded either in shelter homes or enroute are allowed to be brought back by the respective state governments.Till date, about 1.57 lakh residents of Uttarakhand stranded in other states have registered themselves on the government website to return. The state government is bringing them back in state transport corporation buses arranged for the same. Click here for full Covid-19 coverage.A senior government official privy to the development said on the condition of anonymity, “After the new guidlines the number of people to be brought back will surely come down. As per it, those living in their relative’s house or any other accommodation where they are facing no major problems will not be brought back as of now. Those stranded in shelter homes or relief centres will only be brought in the initial phase.”The official added, “In the registration process, it was not required for the migrant to mention where he is staying at present. But after this new guidelines, we might have to initiate the registration process again to filter out those falling under it. This will certainly reduce the number from the total registered migrants of about 1.57 lakh.”Ridhim Aggrawal, deputy inspector general, law and order and State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) said “The evacuation process is ongoing for the stranded residents of the state in which the new guidelines would be strictly adhered to.”Aggrawal, however, couldn’t reveal the amended figure of the total number of migrants to be brought back based on the new guidelines.“So far the state has brought back about 2,700 migrants mainly from Rajasthan, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh (UP).

04-05-2020||India||Casket of Goa’s beloved St Francis Xavier hoping for an Italian restoration job||The silver casket that houses the holy relics of Francis Xavier, a revered Catholic saint, are due to be sent for restoration to Italy, however, a tug of war between church authorities and the Archaeological Society of India over who should conduct the restoration has resulted in an impasse. The silver casket dates back to 1637, when for the first time the mortal remains of the saint were taken away from public view and ensconced in a silver casket and kept atop a specially constructed mausoleum within the Basilica of Bom Jesus at Old Goa. The silver casket has shown serious sign of distress and experts have said that it will become irreparable if no action is taken within the next few years. “We have been wishing to send it to Italy, where they have offered to do it for free. However, the ASI New Delhi put paid to such plans and has instead said that this can be done by the ASI’s chemical institute in Aurangabad,” Fr Patrício Fernandes the Rector of Bom Jesus Basilica said. “However, they cannot restore even a painting and much of the work they do is not up to the mark, so if they cannot do the simple things how will we expect them to do something as delicate as this?” he added. St Francis Xavier is a revered saint and affectionately referred to ‘Goencho saib’ (Lord of Goa). The impressive Baroque Architecture of the Basilica is a huge draw for tourists from across the world to the UNESCO, World Heritage site. Plans were being made to ship the casket to Florence in Italy, before the ASI decided that it would be better to have it restored locally. The church authorities, however, said that they have the local MLAs and MPs in a bid to allow for the shipping of the casket to Florence where the restoration will be done, which if approved, will now happen only after the coronavirus restrictions are lifted. Back in 2018, the authorities had invited experts from Italy to examine the casket who had suggested that the work be done in Florence.Francis Xavier was a Spaniard Jesuit from the Basque province who in 1542 travelled to Portuguese territories in India and beyond right up to Japan for missionary work and whose “incorruptible” remains were exhumed from Sanchian, an island off China where he was initially buried and transferred to Goa the headquarters of the Portuguese maritime empire. He was declared a saint by the Catholic Church in the early 17th century.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/casket-of-goa-s-beloved-st-francis-xavier-hoping-for-an-italian-restoration-job/story-wkYjcYecAnYqUGB3rj9kDK.html

04-05-2020||India||Thousands of migrants made to wait in Madhya Pradesh as UP shuts border||Thousands of workers on their way home were stranded in Madhya Pradesh districts bordering Gujarat, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, as UP sealed its borders to prevent further movement of stranded workers, throwing into disarray the social distancing norms, according to government officials.As per police officials about 8,000 labourers, including women and children, gathered at Bijasan village in Barwani district and more than 5,000 at Pitol in Jhabua district since Saturday as they were not allowed to enter Madhya Pradesh. Similarly, thousands of labourers have gathered at Johariya village in Datia district on MP-UP border as Uttar Pradesh closed its borders to disallow movement of people.Barwani on the MP-Maharastra border is 313 kilometres south west of Bhopal in Nimad region, while Jhabua on MP-Gujarat border is 341 kilometres south west of Bhopal in Malwa region. Datia on MP-UP border is situated 405 kilometres north of Bhopal.Earlier, Barwani administration sent such labourers in about 200 buses to Uttar Pradesh on Thursday and Friday but they were stuck in Datia as UP had closed its border. This is why the administration in Datia didn’t allow further movement of people since then, said an official.Notably, on Sunday agitated labourers in Barwani pelted stones on police personnel at Bijasan village near Sendhwa on not being allowed to enter Madhya Pradesh resulting in injuries to a police sub-inspector and two constables.Though at Bijasan the district the administration made arrangements for food for labourers, the increase in the count of labourers with each passing moment has thrown all the arrangements into disarray, said an official.“We had not anticipated that Uttar Pradesh would close its borders. Even otherwise, it’s not possible to provide basic facilities of stay and food to such a large number of people, that too while ensuring social distancing among them,” said the official.Activist Medha Patkar criticised the governments, both Central and the state, for not taking care of labourers.“People are coming through various modes, some even bare foot, but none is taking care of them, whether it’s the central government or the state governments of UP, MP, Maharashtra and Gujarat,” said Narmada Bachao Andolan leader Medha Patkar.Vishwadeep Singh Parihar, town inspector of police at Sendhwa, said, “There are certain women in the crowd who are pregnant. There are several couples with kids. Hence, the administration has decided to arrange transport for such people to send them to UP border so that they don’t have any problem in staying here and could reach their home early whenever UP border is opened for them.”A stranded migrant complained of lack of food and water for them and rued the arbitrary nature of decision making.“Our group reached here on Sunday morning and we want to go to Uttar Pradesh. The officials here say Yogi ji doesn’t want us to get into Uttar Pradesh. The authorities are making decisions on their own about the opening and closing of the border. There has been no food and water for us since yesterday. There should be at least prior information when they are going to close or open the border,” said Rohit, stranded at Gujarat border, from Faridpur in Uttar Pradesh.Arvind Kumar from Pratapgarh in Uttar Pradesh alleged that people who belong to Madhya Pradesh are being allowed to enter.Collector of Datia district Rohit Singh said, “A number of labourers were allowed to get in, but then again the border was closed from the UP side.”Director general of police, Madhya Pradesh Vivek Johri said, “We have no problem in allowing people to enter Madhya Pradesh but the states which are allowing people to leave and Uttar Pradesh which has to allow them to enter the state have to take a decision on the issue.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/thousands-of-migrants-made-to-wait-in-madhya-pradesh-as-up-shuts-border/story-QICTsKo7vjLA8XIT0onNJP.html

He did not develop any symptoms of Covid-19 after a 14-day home quarantine.Three days ago, Dalei suddenly developed a cough and cold and did not get any relief despite trying home remedies. When his conditions worsened, he was taken to Balasore district headquarters hospital in an ambulance, but he died on the way. He was declared brought dead in Balasore district headquarters hospital where doctors said he suffered from a hepatic coma.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage.However, after Dalei’s body was brought to Khatanagar village late Sunday night, none of the villagers came forward to help in cremation despite his wife’s pleas. “The villagers probably feared that the man died of coronavirus as the person he travelled along from Kolkata had tested positive last month. However, I am sure the man died of hepatic coma and jaundice,” said Dr Bijay Panda, in-charge of Simulia community health centre.As no villagers came forward to help in cremation, Dalei’s family members buried the body by themselves. The CHC in-charge said that since Dalei’s swab sample was not tested earlier, a medical camp will be organised on Tuesday where the swab samples of his family members and neighbours will be examined for coronavirus.On April 27, a man in Bhubaneswar died allegedly after being denied treatment by several private hospitals over fears that he may have contracted coronavirus as he lived close to a containment zone. The man’s wife and daughter had to spend a night on the road with the body after their landlord refused to let them in their rented home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odia-man-buried-after-villagers-boycott-cremation-over-covid-19-fears/story-1S90huZosITGuHhP542xYK.html
04-05-2020||India||Vijay Mallya knocks on UK SC door to block extradition||Controversial businessman Vijay Mallya has filed an application for leave to appeal in the UK’s Supreme Court in the latest bid to block his extradition to India to face charges of major financial offences running into thousands of crores.The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), which acts on India’s behalf in UK courts, said on Monday: “He is seeking leave to appeal to the Supreme Court. The authorities in India/CPS have until May 14 to respond to his application”.The Supreme Court usually takes up only cases that involve public interest. The high court of England and Wales had dismissed his appeal on April 20, upholding a lower court’s judgement that there is a prima facie case against him of fraud by representation.In extradition cases, UK courts only need to establish whether there is a prima facie case against the person requested, and not to prove the person’s guilt or otherwise.Mallya tweeted after the April 20 ruling: “I will continue to pursue further legal remedies as advised by my lawyers. I am also disappointed with the media narrative which states that I must face trial in India for a fraud of Rs 9000 crores”.“I must draw attention to paragraph 6 of the judgement which is available to the public. Please note that the allegations against me and others are specifically and only related to three tranches of borrowing from IDBI Bank for a total of Rs 900 crores in 2009”.“This loan was subsumed along with loans from other Banks within the Master Debt Recast Agreement of 2010. Following the DRT order for the payment of approximately Rs 5000 crores by way of Principal and Rs 1200 crores by way of unapplied interest making a total of Rs 6200 crores”.“The Banks have already recovered in cash a sum of Rs 2500 crores which is 50 percent of the Principal amount. I have repeatedly offered to pay the Banks in full but, sadly to no avail”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vijay-mallya-knocks-on-uk-sc-door-to-block-extradition/story-KpiGAJ1gJ6RGDLKicFedGM.html
04-05-2020||India||Maharashtra govt accuses Arnab Goswami of interfering with probe, moves SC||The Maharashtra government has accused senior journalist Arnab Goswami of interfering with the probe against him by using his tweets and television debates to browbeat the Mumbai Police.In an application moved before the top court, the state sought urgent orders to restrain the journalist from engaging in such acts that creates a “fear psychosis” among the force impeding their ability to probe the case without fear or favour.Goswami faces multiple complaints of inciting hatred among religious groups, which are now being probed under a single complaint at the NM Joshi Marg police station in Mumbai.What has prompted the state to approach the Supreme Court is an order of April 24 by which police cannot take any coercive action against Goswami for three weeks. The direction came on a petition by Goswami who sought clubbing of multiple cases against him along with protection from arrest.The fresh application by the state said, “Petitioner (Goswami) considers indulgence granted by this Court as some kind of a license to indulge in unwarranted sensationalism and to ridicule, denigrate, and defame the police department and its officers.” The application seeks a restraint order against Goswami from indulging in such acts that tantamount to interference with the investigation. A further direction has been sought asking Goswami not to abuse the indulgence granted to him by the court on April 24 and cooperate with the investigation.The application filed by advocate Sachin Patil states that the series of tweets against the police emerged after April 26 when Goswami was called by the police to join the probe. He was upset that the police was unnecessarily questioning him in connection with the FIR against him. He also alleged that the police did not act on his complaint of April 23 when two bike-borne men attacked his car while returning from work.The application stated that the television show hosted by Goswami on April 28 showed the Commissioner of Police in bad light by making false charges against him. Accusing him of making a “media spectacle” of the case against him, the application said, “The act and conduct of the petitioner would tantamount to encroaching upon the area of investigation (sole prerogative of the police) as also subjecting the entire criminal justice system to ridicule.”Goswami has also been accused of carrying out a “vicious propaganda” against the police by abusing his journalistic freedom to malign the police force and its chief using false allegations. Incidentally, Goswami has filed a second petition in the apex court with regard to a fresh FIR lodged against him on May 2, seeking similar relief from arrest. This case emanates out of his telecast which accused people of one community crowding at Bandra on April 15-16.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-govt-accuses-arnab-goswami-of-interfering-with-probe-moves-sc/story-9eNMaIMl8VuGUI9cXACvfP.html

04-05-2020||India||Plasma therapy ‘no magic bullet’ against Covid-19; Need large-scale trials to prove efficacy: Experts||The convalescent plasma therapy is no “magic bullet” to deal with coronavirus, and only large-scale controlled trials can ascertain its efficacy as part of the treatment strategy, top medical experts said on Monday, even as several states are considering the use of the therapy to treat critically-ill Covid-19 patients.The therapy involves taking antibodies from the blood of a person who has recovered from Covid-19 and transfusing those antibodies into an active coronavirus patient to help kickstart the immune system to fight the infection.The Health Ministry last week warned against its use, saying that the plasma therapy for treatment of coronavirus patients is at an experimental stage and has the potential to cause life-threatening complications.However, some state governments, including Rajasthan, Punjab, Maharashtra and Delhi have shown keenness for plasma therapy treatment, and the Centre has permitted few states to perform plasma therapy on a limited number of Covid-19 patients.Top medical experts feel it should not be looked upon as something that could make a “huge difference” in the treatment of Covid-19 and only randomised controlled trials can prove its efficacy as an important treatment strategy.Director of AIIMS, Delhi, Dr Randeep Guleria said there have been very few convalescent plasma therapy trials as far as Covid-19 is concerned, and only in very few patients it has shown some benefit.“It is just one part of the treatment strategy. It helps improve the person’s own immunity by giving what we call passive immunity because the antibodies in the plasma enter the blood and try to help fight the virus in the afflicted individual. It is not something which will dramatically make a difference,” Guleria told PTI.There is no study to suggest that “it is a magic bullet” or it will make a dramatic difference, but it is part of the armamentarium of treatment that physicians have along with other drugs, the senior pulmonologist said.ICMR has already called for a proposal and a large number of institutes have enrolled for the convalescent plasma therapy trials, he said.“Important issue to remember is that not everyone’s plasma can be given, you also have to test the blood ----whether it is safe and also has enough antibodies. So, you have to have an antibody testing mechanism which is being done by NIV (National Institute of Virology), Pune, to show that the plasma you are giving has enough antibodies” Guleria said.Research should be done on a multi-pronged treatment strategy and should not be focused on only one strategy, the AIIMS Director said.“You will need to give it to a large number of individuals, more than 200 or 300 people and then analyse the data...We should go ahead in research mode giving it to more people and do a proper well conducted study so as to know one way or the other,” Guleria said.Dr Vivek Nangia, Director Pulmonology, MICU and Sleep Disorders, Fortis Hospital, Vasant Kunj, said the therapy is only in the experimental stage, but it is promising as there is a clinical knowledge involved, and also some experiments and past experience behind it having been used for SARS and H1N1 epidemics in a limited manner.“Dire circumstances require desperate measures, you need to have an out of the box thinking and this is one of those measures, when nothing else is working you want to try this, there is no harm. It has its pros and cons,” he told PTI.Backing Guleria, Nangia also said, “larger randomized placebo-controlled trials are very essential only then we can make it a standard of therapy.” These expert views come amid lack of definitive evidence in favour of or against the use of the convalescent plasma therapy.As per reports, a patient who was administered plasma therapy for the first time at a private hospital here was discharged last week after being cured, while the first person to undergo plasma therapy in Maharashtra had died in Mumbai’s Lilavati Hospital.Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had said last week that the Delhi government will not stop clinical trials of plasma therapy to treat severally-ill Covid-19 patients as its initial results are good. Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Sunday said that with the ICMR nod, SMS hospital in Jaipur will start convalescent plasma therapy on Covid-19 patients from Monday, while Maharashtra, which had started the trials last month after a nod from the ICMR, is considering to continue with it despite the Union health ministry warning. Professor Rajesh Malhotra, Chief Trauma Centre AIIMS, said as of now, there is no concrete evidence of convalescent plasma therapy’s usefulness.“It essentially relies on the assumption that the body fires up its resistance in the form of chemicals called antibodies to fight the infection and those who have recovered have sufficient numbers in their convalescent plasma to fight the infection,” Malhotra said.However, the degree of antibody response that a person throws and the timing are variables, making it difficult to have a predictable standard protocol, he said.It is too early to say if plasma treatment is the only way and it has its own risks also, the AIIMS professor said, adding that at present it is at best an experimental therapy and definitive answers cannot be obtained without large-scale trials.Dr Pankaj Kumar, Head of Critical Care Unit Fortis Hospital, Shalimar Bagh, echoed similar views, saying trials till now are too small to clear doubts about the therapy and large-scale trials should be done.“Theoretically speaking it should be helpful because we are taking the antibodies from a person who has had the infection. But it is still experimental... we have to weigh the risks and benefits,” he told PTI.Dr Atul Kakar, Vice-Chairman, Department of Medicine, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, said it is very important to pick the right patient for being the donor as he has to have a very severe infection so that the antibodies are quite high and should be free from other viruses.According to medical experts, large-scale trials will also help in answering key questions such as the tangible benefits of the plasma therapy, which category of patients are likely to benefit, at what stage of the disease will this therapy gives maximum returns, the right dosage and its adverse effects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/plasma-therapy-no-magic-bullet-against-covid-19-need-large-scale-trials-to-prove-efficacy-experts/story-LefKFEXQOznTzQZ3o9n4XM.html

Replies from IFCN’s database of debunked fake news will be available to people at +1 (727) 2912606.Baybars Örsek, Director at the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN) at the Poynter Institute, said that the chatbot which is available in English alone will be released in Hindi soon. “The service is launching in English but will be available in other languages including Hindi, Portuguese and Spanish in due course. We are working to include other languages,” Örsek said. A release from WhatsApp said that through the chatbot, people can check whether a piece of content about Covid-19 has already been rated as false by professional fact-checkers. “Since January, more than 80 fact-checking organizations from 74 countries have identified more than 4,000 hoaxes related to the novel coronavirus. All this information now forms the CoronaVirusFacts database and is updated daily by the IFCN so chatbot users can navigate and easily access its content,” the release said.Örsek said that users can search for these debunked news through the chatbot. “The IFCN bot is primarily a way to distribute fact-checks to WhatsApp users and to provide access to a searchable database of Coronavirus debunked hoaxes. It allows users to review IFCN’s database of 4000 debunked myths, to search for fact checks by word or phrase, access to tips to protect themselves from falsehoods, and also to find out how to contact local fact-checkers in their country,” he said. Through the chatbot, an user can access a global directory of fact-checking organisations, and the user’s country is detected from the mobile country code to provide contacts of fact-checking organisations which are closest. “The person can then submit a piece of information for review directly to its local fact-checker or visit it,” WhatsApp said in a release. With the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, there is a spike in the volume of fake news, and WhatsApp has been grappling to deal with it, especially in India where it has over 450 million users. As the pandemic spread, the private messaging platform brought in product changes, including reducing the number forwards of a ‘highly forwarded message’ to just one chat. The company says this has brought down virality of messages which has already reduced the number of highly forwarded messages shared on the service by 70%. Örsek said that some of these fake news items were about symptoms of the disease. “The first couple of weeks after the first case was detected outside China, we have seen so many pieces of misinformation on the spread of the virus and false symptoms. It had been the case especially in Europe, where the virus spread from Italy to Spain and then eventually to the different parts of the world where we saw a big volume of misinformation on the spread of the virus,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ifcn-s-chatbot-on-whatsapp-to-help-debunk-covid-19-related-fake-news/story-54LOTq8KlxnfisjBeOAfLL.html

The Ashok Gehlot-led government’s decision followed Congress president Sonia Gandhi’s barb against the Centre accusing it of forcing migrant workers to pay for tickets amid the pandemic. She urged Congress workers to raise funds to pay for the migrants’ rail fare.“On directions of Sonia Gandhi, we have decided that the state government will pay the rail fare of migrant workers going from Rajasthan to other states,” chief minister Ashok Gehlot tweeted on Monday.The state government has already paid for three special trains – Jaipur to Patna, Nagaur to Hatia (Jharkhand) and Ajmer and Dankuni (West Bengal) – that were run by the north-western railway (NWR).An officer of the NWR’s commercial wing said the Rajasthan government paid Rs 473,760 for the Jaipur to Patna train, which carried 1,180 migrant workers on Friday midnight; Rs 834,000 for Nagaur to Hatia train that carried 905 passengers on Sunday; and Rs 825,660, which transported 1,186 pilgrims stranded in Ajmer to Dankuni, West Bengal, on Monday.“We aren’t dealing with individuals. We’re dealing with the state government and they’re responsible for arranging the fare, whether from the state exchequer or via donations,” the NWR officer said, requesting anonymity.Each of these special trains had 24 coaches – four general class, 18 sleeper coaches and two guard vans – and carried 54 passengers in each coach against the normal capacity of 72 due to the strict enforcement of social distancing norms. No passenger is allowed on the trains’ return journey.The Centre allowed special trains for stranded workers, pilgrims and students on Friday after requests from state governments.For special trains to carry students from Kota, the coaching hub of the country for medical and engineering aspirants, to Jharkhand and Bihar, the respective state governments paid the fare, said Pankaj Sharma, divisional railway manager (DRM), Kota.“We got the payment through the Rajasthan government before departure of each of the six special trains that we’ve have run since Friday,” he said. “The Bihar and Jharkhand governments made the payment to the Rajasthan government.”Around 7,000 students from the two eastern states left Kota on six special trains till Monday evening.

The government ordered a nationwide lockdown from March 25 for three weeks that was extended twice and is scheduled to end on May 17.AePS is a payment service that uses a customer’s Aadhaar identity to access his or her bank account and perform basic banking transactions such as balance enquiry, cash deposit, cash withdrawal, Aadhaar to Aadhaar fund transfer and remittances through a business correspondent (BC) in remote areas.The government has so far disbursed Rs 32,300 crore in bank accounts of 34 crore beneficiaries since the launch of Rs 1.7 lakh crore welfare scheme under PMGKY on March 26 by finance minister Nirmala sitharaman to protect the poor from the impact of lockdown due to Covid-19, another finance ministry official said requesting anonymity.PMGKY scheme includes free distribution of wheat, rice and pulses, three cooking gas cylinders and cash assistance to the poor for three months starting from April. It also offers Rs 500 per month to 20 crore women Jan Dhan account holders for three months so that they can run their households in the lockdown period without any disruption.AePS is easy to use, safe and secure payment platform to avail benefits by using Aadhaar number and biometrics as it eliminates the threat of any fraud and non-genuine activity, the second official said.The system is used to facilitate disbursements of government entitlements such as the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Program (MGNREGA), social security pension, and handicapped old age pension. The system enables banks to extend financial services to customers in remote locations where they do not branch networks and operate through banking correspondents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/daily-usage-of-aadhaar-enabled-payment-system-doubles-to-11-3-million-in-the-lockdown/story-ylA1xbThdIMLqVYPzzRK7J.html

Only 15 minutes are left for the swearing in”, a bench of justices Deepak Gupta and Aniruddha Bose told Mahaswamiji before rejecting his plea.The central government had, on April 30, cleared the appointment of Desai and four other judicial officers as additional judges of the Karnataka high court.The Supreme Court collegium had recommended their elevation ten days earlier on April 20.Mahaswamiji claimed that four of the five were either his batchmates or senior to him. But Desai was junior to him in service and the appointment of Desai amounted to superseding him, Mahaswamiji submitted.“It is a case of superseding/passing over of a senior District judge (who was appointed on 25.02.2008 under reserved category i.e., Scheduled caste) by junior district judge and the recommendation of Padmaraj Desai by the collegium is unlawful, arbitrary”, the petition said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/judge-s-plea-to-stall-elevation-of-junior-rejected-minutes-before-oath/story-4GFucjDEOmti9QbCd0RjsJ.html

Even I received minor injuries on my arm,” said Rajkumar.“It seems they had planned the attack in advance. We have detained over 80 persons and brought the situation under control,” said the IPS officer.In the morning, around 50 labourers from Uttar Pradesh got their heads tonsured here, saying the buses on which they left for their native state two days back after initial nod were forced to halt at Kosamba in the district for want of “valid permission” and sent back to Surat.They said hey have been waiting endlessly for the administration to clear their journey back home.A worker demanded that the governments of Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat co-ordinate their movement without delay, and claimed bus fare, which they arranged with much difficulty, has not been returned to them.“Many of us sold off our watches and mobile phones to arrange for the bus fare. Now we are still at the same place, with no permission given to our buses to move.“We are stranded here with no help from officials. We demand the governments of the two states to coordinate fast for our return back home,” he said.Till Sunday, eight trains carrying migrant workers had left for Uttar Pradesh and Odisha from Gujarat.Four trains from Ahmedabad, carrying around 1,200 migrant labourers each, travelled to Uttar Pradesh and an equal number of trains from Surat left for Odisha.In Rajkot, hundreds of migrant workers came out on road in Shapar-Veraval industrial area on the city outskirts, demanding that they be sent back home.Police said they managed to persuade the workers to call off the protest, and brought the situation under control.“We have reached out to migrants in residential localities and explained to them that they will be allowed to leave after getting a medical check-up done and completing other formalities,” Rajkot Deputy Commissioner of Police (Zone-1) Ravi Mohan Saini said.Rajkot district collector Ramya Mohan said the administration has been given strict instruction to follow the government-prescribed guidelines while sending migrant workers back to their home states.We have get the names of migrant workers registered and sent them to the respective state for approval. Then we have to request the Railways for their transit.“Based on our request, the Railways will make arrangements for trains only after the home state concerned gives permission for their return, Mohan said.These procedures take time and migrant workers need to show patience in returning to their native places, the Rajkot collector said.Some migrant workers also gathered outside the Rajkot collector’s office to fill forms for returning home, saying they had no food and money to sustain their livelihood.“The factory where I worked is closed, and I want to go back to my native place. They say we will have to arrange our our own vehicles to return to our native place, but we want the government to send us back in train,” a worker said.PTI COR PJT KA PD VT GK RSY RSY||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lockdown-3-0-eager-to-return-home-migrants-clash-with-police-in-surat/story-rKF6dVsA4oAQinMgsXqq6L.html

Secretary general Desh Deepak Verma informed that savings of Rs. 60 crore have already been identified against the annual budget of Rs. 423 crore for the secretariat for 2020-21. Total savings of Rs. 80 core are being targeted as the financial year progresses,” said an official aware of the details.The official said Naidu had given instructions that in view of the extension of lockdown till May 17 and the need for the executive’s undivided focus on containing the spread of Covid-19, a view on holding meetings of department-related standing committees and other committees of the House will be formulated later.This was the first meeting Naidu held with senior officials of the secretariat since the nationwide lockdown began on March 25.Naidu also instructed officials to initiate action to fill up the posts of chairmen of eight committees. These vacancies arose after the retirement of some Rajya Sabha members.The vacancies include the posts of chairmen of department-related standing committees on human resource development and industries, which were held by Satyanarayan Jatiya and K Keshava Rao respectively. The chairmanship of three standing committees on privileges, subordinate legislation, and papers laid on the table fell vacant with the retirement of Harivansh, deputy chairman, T Subbarami Reddy and CP Thakur respectively.Three other committees without heads are those on ethics, MPLADS and provision of computers for members of Rajya Sabha (PCMRS), which were led by Prabhat Jha, Harivansh and Tiruchi Siva.“As for oath taking by 38 members who were recently elected unopposed, it has been decided oath will be administered to them inside the chamber of the Rajya Sabha after the lockdown, if feasible, before the next session so as to comply with the norm of physical distance, with their family members likely to attend,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajya-sabha-announces-austerity-measures-to-cut-rs-80-cr-expenses/story-XGOLw1tMElrl07z9VhXemM.html

04-05-2020||India||Migrant workers’ return en masse from urban hubs a concern: Empowered group||The return of migrant labourers en masse from urban hubs of work to their villages is a primary area of concern, the Empowered Group, headed by Niti Aayog chairman Amitabh Kant, has noted in a progress report. Scores of NGOs are coordinating efforts and working closely with the district administrations and state governments so that measures of care, quarantine, and treatment go hand in hand, it added. The group had directed all chief secretaries to appoint state-level nodal Officers to coordinate with all NGOs and resolve their issues apart from leveraging their resources and networks. “Almost all States have appointed Nodal Officers to liaise with NGOs/CSOs.All Chief Secretaries were requested to instruct the District Administrations to leverage the bandwidth of NGOs and CSOs; Nominate Nodal NGO for each district, or groups of Districts for coordinating with the District Nodal Officer; and identify areas and sectors to stop duplicity and overlaps,” it said. “NGOs were also urged to lift and distribute rice and wheat from the Food Corporation of India’s godowns at the subsidized rate of Rs 21-22 per kg respectively so that no one in the country remains hungry,” it added. The empowered group committee is monitoring and coordinating with the NGO and Civil Society Organisations across all states and 700 districts on a real time basis to fight the spread of Covid-19. It has engaged with Civil Society Organisations, NGOs, development partners, UN Agencies, and industry associations in over 15 meetings.“In the Aspirational Districts Programme piloted by NITI Aayog, as of now there are about 610 cases in 112 aspirational districts which is considered fairly low at less than 2% of the national level of infections,” the empowered group said. Of these, six districts have reported the first case after April 21. Major hotspots are Baramula (62), Nuh (57), Ranchi (55), YSR (55), Kupwara (47) and Jaisalmer(34) it added. NITI Aayog has taken steps to ensure that these districts are able to contain the spread of the virus and has actively referred the requirements in testing kits, PPE and masks to the respective empowered groups for necessary action in order to address supply constraints, it noted. “Collaboration has been one of the guiding principles in Aspirational District Programme and these partnerships have enabled the District Administrations in ramping up isolation camps, setting up control rooms, door-to-door food supplies, distribution of cooked foods, mobilization of Self Help Groups for making home-made masks, sanitizers and re-usable & sterilizable protective gear while simultaneously sustaining their livelihoods during lockdown period. Osmanabad is one such district where a testing Centre has been established by utilizing the CSR corpus,” it said. The empowered group has also mobilised these 92,000 NGOs across districts for monitoring and coordinating. “It is a record of sorts, to harness their strengths and resources, expertise in key social sectors-nutrition, health, sanitation, education, and extensive reach in the community,” a Niti Aayog official said. The group has involved them in identifying hotspots and deputing volunteers; delivering essential services to the vulnerable, including the homeless, daily wage workers, migrants, and urban poor families; and in creating awareness about prevention, social distancing, and isolation. In the next phase, the group will mobilise CSOs and NGOs for movement against Covid-19 stigmatisation and in protecting the elderly and senior citizens. The UN in India has prepared a Joint Response Plan (JRP) with prevention, treatment and essential supplies as key components.“Skill building of 15,300 trainers, training for 3951 surveillance/ health officers on Integrated Health Information Platform, infection prevention and control training in 890 hospitals, support to ICMR for testing, strengthening risk communication and community engagement capabilities of healthcare workers, procurement of 2 lakh PPEs and 4 lakh N95 masks, have been initiated by WHO and UNICEF,” the report said. The UN is also engaged in the procurement of medical supplies including ventilators (initially 1000 units as per the current requests, but potentially higher based on future demand) for 25 States. Further, an order of 10,000 ventilators and 10 million PPE Kits to UNICEF was expedited by group, it said. Niti Aayog has also engaged with the Indian Red Cross Society whose 40,000 volunteers are working with district administration in over 500 districts. It has created quarantine/isolation facilities at 33 locations, facilitated donation of ventilators, masks, PPEs, and test kits valued at Rs 5.50 crore, apart from relief and advocacy across the 500 districts, it added. The group has also urged all CSOs, NGOs, International Organisations and Industry partners to effectively utilise the Arogya Setu app in their operations. According to Niti Aayog, 80 million people have installed the app thus far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/migrant-workers-return-en-masse-from-urban-hubs-a-concern-empowered-group/story-ECkwcTC6HDYtfwhEYi1uaJ.html
04-05-2020||India||‘Bengal becoming a police state’: Governor sharpens attack on CM Mamata||Amid increasing coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases, the political temperature continued soaring with governor Jagdeep Dhankhar alleging that West Bengal was emerging as a “police state” on Monday. The state’s ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) dismissed Dhankhar’s statements, made in a fresh letter to chief minister Mamata Banerjee, as “nonsense” and alleged that the governor was working as spokesperson for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) party.In his letter, Dhankhar pointed to a “collapsing health sector” and “politicised public distribution system” in West Bengal, and alleged that the state was “emerging as a police state” where voices of opposition parties were being muzzled.Countering Banerjee’s allegation that the governor was trying to “usurp power” in the time of a crisis, Dhankhar said: “People in the state know only too well who in the state is usurper and extra-constitutional fountain of power. Who runs government and syndicates. Who is this ABCD! An open secret! Surely, I am not the person.”BJP leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah, have accused the ruling Trinamool of running “syndicates”, which loosely refer to groups forcing people to buy products from them. The Trinamool has rubbished the charges as “ill-intended political propaganda”. Monday’s development was the latest in a “letter war” between the chief minister and the governor. Dhankhar has been at loggerheads with the government for some time. But the fresh letter war intensified after Banerjee wrote to Dhankhar on April 23 in response to a series of letters and social media posts by the governor. Dhankar then wrote two letters to Banerjee, on April 23 and 24, responding to which she wrote another letter on May 2. “He (Dhankar) is keen on working as a BJP spokesperson. Political commentary is not part of a governor’s job. He has turned Raj Bhavan into an extension of BJP’s office,” said TMC secretary-general Partha Chatterjee.Trinamool’s Lok Sabha leader, Sudip Banerjee, rubbished the governor’s charges as “non-sense”. “We would take a call whether to respond to his statements and letters at all. He speaks gibberish. He is merely playing his role in Centre’s plan to discredit Bengal,” he said.The Left and the Congress, meanwhile, urged both the chief minister and the governor to stop this “letter war”. “What are they doing? Exchanging letters and trading barbs are not the need of the hour. They must stop,” said Sujan Chakraborty, leader of the Left parties in the state assembly.The Congress’s Lok Sabha leader, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, too, urged both chief minister and the governor to stop firing salvos at each other and to focus on the pandemic situation.“The controversy has been mounting for quite some time now. This is not a time for such time debates and controversies. I urge both of them to refrain to making comments at each other and to stop this letter war right now,” said political analyst Amal Kumar Mukhopadhyay, former principal of Presidency College.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-becoming-a-police-state-dhankar-sharpens-attack-on-mamata/story-TuXzHNvloYwctADKCU4NWL.html

We will have to be ready to live with coronavirus. The lockdown was necessary to contain Covid-19, but Delhi is fully ready to relax lockdown restrictions,” the Delhi chief minister had informed people.The relaxations came barely two days after the Centre extended the nationwide lockdown for another two weeks on Friday.

04-05-2020||India||Ahead of WHO’s virtual meet, some real pressure on Tedros. And a complication||The World Health Organisation on Monday told member states that it will soon start sending out formal invites for the truncated version of its annual meet later this month.The World Health Assembly’s virtual meet comes at a time the global health body chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus is at the centre of a huge row over its initial response to the outbreak of coronavirus disease in China’s Wuhan.WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has been accused by the United States of helping China play down the disease in the early stages.Last month, Donald Trump declared that the US would hold back $ 400 million funding to the Geneva-headquartered WHO. A fortnight later, the US Director of National Intelligence issued a rare statement announcing a review of intercepted communications and other data to determine whether China, and possibly the WHO, concealed information about coronavirus.Diplomats in Washington and Geneva suggest that the WHO meet might eventually be a staid affair because it would have a very limited agenda. It is not clear if there would be an opportunity to discuss the impact of the United States’ suspension of funding on the global health body’s projects since the meeting of the Programme, Budget and Administration committee has been indefinitely deferred.But diplomats insist the effort to mount pressure on Tedros, who still has one more year to go, would continue to mount.The Ethopian politician, who was the health minister between 2005 and 2012 before taking over as foreign minister for the next four years in the government then run by his party, Tigray People’s Liberation Front, has a doctoral degree in community health.The WHO chief already has letters of support issued by the Non-Aligned Movement and the African Union leadership, a signal that he wasn’t willing to stand down.Neither is the United States.US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo has continued to pile pressure on China on Sunday, insisting that there was “enormous evidence” to show that the coronavirus outbreak began in a laboratory in Wuhan, China.That renewed offensive spooked investors who saw signs of a flare-up in US-China tensions and contributed to southeast Asian stocks slipping on Monday. To be sure, the US decision to hold back money committed to the WHO has been criticised by many countries. But it has put the focus back on the initial response by China, and by default, the chief of WHO that calls itself the “global guardian of public health”.Tedros’ praise for China fuels criticismSome of the criticism aimed at Tedros is powered by his statements too. Like the one made two days after a closed-door meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping on 28 January.On 30 January, Tedros told the world that China is “setting a new standard for outbreak control”. A few hours after his effusive praise, the WHO declared the disease that may have originated from one wet market in China’s Wuhan a Public Health Emergency of International Concern for the world.Three months later, the disease, according to news agency AFP, has killed over 245,000 people, infected 3.4 million, forced half of humanity to live under some form of lockdown and pushed the global economy towards its worst downturn since the Great Depression.Complication over TaiwanLong before the Tedros-led World Health Organisation begins the annual meet, it has found itself in another bit of a complication, also involving China and the United States.The self-ruled island, which Beijing considers a wayward province awaiting reunification, has been excluded from WHO membership due to objections from China. Taiwan has attended the assembly as an observer from 2009-2016 when Taipei-Beijing relations warmed, but China blocked further participation after the election of Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, who China views as a separatist. Taipei rejects that stand and insists that its exclusion creates a glaring gap in the global fight against the coronavirus.Taiwan has reported far fewer cases of the new coronavirus than many of its neighbours, due to early and effective detection and prevention work.The United States has already supported Taiwan’s participation at the assembly as an observer calling its exclusion an “affront” to UN principles, provoking a sharp outburst by the Chinese foreign ministry which expressed “strong outrage and firm opposition”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-who-s-virtual-meet-some-real-pressure-on-tedros-and-a-complication/story-4Cldpmn7J1SwbaTaUKhskI.html

The Indian aviation sector has been badly-hit due to the global health crisis which has led to flights being grounded and all international and domestic travel being stalled amid a nationwide lockdown, which has been extended twice. GoAir has managed to pay full salaries to 40 per cent of total employees (2,500), it said while the remaining employees are getting paid on a graded or deferred basis.“With no inflow of cash, which we are now anticipating will continue through the end of May, a period of over 10 weeks, and with no support forthcoming yet from either the government or the banking system, we were left with no alternative but to make the unfortunate and sad decision to pay the March earned salaries over March and April,” the joint letter said.“The limitations on our resources are not of our own making and the sacrifices we are imposing on you are sadly beyond our control,” the letter to the employees read.The private airline, like many others, has been forced to send people on leave without pay due to the current crisis.The letter also pointed out that GoAir’s board members, chairman and managing director were not drawing any remuneration.“Our CEO has taken a 50 per cent pay cut and voluntarily deferred most of his balance compensation. The senior management, too, has taken substantial pay cuts and have also deferred a portion of the compensation,” it read.The management top brass also mentioned how airlines in the United States, Europe, South/East Asia and the Middle East are getting significant support from their respective governments to tide them through this “unprecedented crisis”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goair-writes-to-staff-about-deferred-salaries-says-airline-left-with-no-choice/story-lGxDpdRoyvE0DQvC4oXDiM.html

04-05-2020||India||Central team questions Bengal govt’s claim on Covid-19 testing||One of the two inter-ministerial central teams (IMCT) sent to assess West Bengal’s response to Covid-19 has pointed out discrepancies in the number of cases reported, a high mortality rate and questioned the state government’s claim of having surveyed five million people.The team has detailed the discrepancies in its final observations submitted to the West Bengal government. HT has accessed a copy of the observations. The state and the Centre have exchanged words over the teams, availability of testing kits and gaps in West Bengal’s response to Covid-19. West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee last week accused the Centre of maligning the state and spreading “canards” about its testing figures when the “real problem” was with the testing kits supplied. She lashed out at the teams for calling officers indiscriminately and hampering the fight against Covid-19. The teams have complained that they did not get enough support from the state government.In its observations, the team cited the state’s April 30 medical bulletin, saying it reported 572 cases and added that 139 patients had been discharged after treatment while 33 had died of the disease, making a total of 744. “In a communication to union health secretary on the same day, the total number of cases was indicated to be 931 leading to a discrepancy of 187 cases,” the team said. It added the state classified 72 fatalities on April 30 due to Covid-19 as deaths due to co-morbidities. “The bulletin of May 1 and 2 does not even mention the total number of cases and deaths...”The team questioned the state’s claims of very high levels of daily surveillance in containment zones. “During the stay of the committee itself, over 50 lakh [ five million] persons would have been surveyed in the four districts. Collating and evaluating a database of this magnitude requires very robust systems to be in place. However, no such evidence was available during our stay or field visits,” noted the IMCT leader Apruva Chandra.“The IMCT notes that the state government has on April 30 made a pronouncement that henceforth all deaths of Covid patients would be indicated in the daily statistics and the death certificate would be issued by the hospital with the Committee of Doctors only examining a random sample.” The team called it a big step towards transparency but at the same time added it raised the total death count of Covid-19 patients to 105 as on April 30. “For a total reported number of 744 + 72 = 816 Covid patients, the mortality rate of 12.8% is by far the highest in the country. This extremely high mortality rate is a clear indication of low testing and weak surveillance and tracking.” An IMCT member, who spoke on condition of anonymity, cited the case of a Border Security Force driver, who developed Covid-19 symptoms on May 1 to underline the state’s lax attitude. “He was tested and the result came positive on May 3. But there has been no effort from anyone in the state government to trace the contacts or get his family tested.” The team reiterated its accusation that the West Bengal government has been “antagonistic” towards it and has not supported the IMCT in the performance of its duties. It added this is in contrast with the experience of IMCTs deputed to other states, where top officials attended their meetings.The IMCT, which was due to submit its final report to the Union home ministry on Monday, earlier asked the West Bengal government to explain the methodology used to ascertain Covid-19 deaths and whether it was in line with the Indian Council of Medical Research guidelines.The Centre has also deputed inter-ministerial teams to Gujarat, Telangana, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu to probe perceived lapses in efforts to control Covid-19 and violations of lockdown regulations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/central-team-questions-bengal-govt-s-claim-on-covid-19-testing/story-pTuQDByvUIT4ROm8COyPII.html
04-05-2020||India||Sholay, Dabangg dialogues to educate about forest fires in Uttarakhand||The Uttarakhand forest department is employing dialogues from hit Bollywood films like Sholay, The Dirty Picture, Dabangg, among others, to spread awareness about preventing forest fires. The initiative is the brainchild of Rudraprayag divisional forest officer Vaibhav Singh. Elaborating upon it, the officer said the main idea behind such awareness posters was to make people stop and read them so that they take the information back with them.“Any awareness campaign should be catchy and attractive with the aim that people don’t easily forget the basic information. If people stop and watch for even once and then share it with others our job is done. We have been getting a very good response from locals since the posters were put up,” said Singh.Around 1,500 posters have been made so far with almost 200-odd posters already placed in every forest range. The posters also give information on punishment for setting forests on fire, that is, a fine of Rs 5,000 and imprisonment up to two years. It also has the fire control room numbers mentioned so that people can call and alert the department about any fire incident.With lockdown relaxations and movement allowed in green zones from today, officials also fear that forest fire incidents could increase. Uttarakhand has lost 11 hectares this year with 18 incidents of forest fire.“We have been lucky till now because there have been rains every two-three days maintaining the moisture content, but now temperatures are rising. With the relaxations being given to people in the lockdown, there might be a probability of forest fires. With more and more people coming back to their villages, movement in forests has also increased,” added Singh.The awareness posters are mostly being put up at markets and places where people go on a regular basis so that more people can see them.Official records show that wildfire incidents this year had come down by over 50% till April amid the lockdown enforced to fight coronavirus.Most cases of forest fire incidents in the state are man-made and the reduced number of cases are likely due to restricted movement of people in and near forest areas.BK Gangte, nodal officer for forest fires in the state, said that cases of wildfires have been significantly less this year, but it cannot be said if it is an effect of the lockdown. The department is analysing the data, he added. In Uttarakhand, 0.17% of total forest cover comes under the extremely fire prone category, 1.60% under very highly fire prone, 9.32% under highly fire prone, 21.66% under moderately fire prone and 67.25% under less fire prone category.Since the formation of the state in 2000, over 44,554 hectares of the forest area has been damaged in forest fires accruing a loss of over Rs 185 lakh, revealed an RTI reply by the state government last year.The forest department has around 174 watchtowers and 1,437 station crew across the state to keep a tab on the forest fires and take measures to check them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sholay-dabangg-dialogues-to-educate-about-forest-fires-in-uttarakhand/story-KNy18DV582n6Gt9yIGbauM.html

She is belting out songs live on her Facebook page to collect money to feed the needy in the port city.Stephanie Herve, a music therapist, is a regular in Kerala and this time when the lockdown was imposed she pitched in to help the poor who have been struggling for food. “I feel it is my duty. I don’t want to talk much about it,” she said adding she hates publicity for doing “her duty”.“Hailing from Bordeaux she has been visiting Kerala every year. When the lockdown came she said she wanted to help people. Initially, she started funding a community kitchen in the area and later we decided to distribute grocery kits to the needy. Soon, she started singing sessions with my son to collect money for the initiative,” Usha Antony, owner of the homestay in Fort Kochi, where Herve has been staying since March said. She said Herve has distributed around 600 kits containing rice, pulses, cooking oil and other essentials so far.“She possibly contributed food kits worth between Rs 5 lakh or Rs 6 lakh. Her involvement is great and we should salute her spirit. She runs a charity organisation called ‘Gabriel’ in France to fund the cause of children. Now she is conducting regular music and meditation sessions to fund her initiative in Kochi,” Congress leader and former minister Dominic Presentation said.“Besides French, she sings in English and Malayalam also. She has learnt Malayalam and Sanskrit. I was told her Sanskrit hymns are very popular. She has taught my 15-year-old son Tomson Antony French. Her renditions are mellifluous. She likes India very much,” said Usha Antony who is running a homestay in Kochi for the last two decades. Her husband is the cousin of legendary singer K J Yesudas, she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stranded-french-woman-in-kochi-sings-on-fb-to-raise-funds-to-feed-poor/story-dkOBVDu0XV0fvZeXkZVmyJ.html

On her return that evening, Pune’s additional municipal commissioner Rubal Agarwal was greeted by her son Rishiv and husband, with welcome cards and her favourite delicacies.This is one of the delightful anecdotes that the IAS officer recounted in an interview to HT as she spoke of her role in bringing the Covid-19 pandemic under control in Pune. Agarwal not only supervises the health department of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) bus is also chief executive officer (CEO) of Pune Smart City Development Corporation Limited (PSCDCL),Click here for full Covid-19 coverage.With Pune being one of the prominent Covid-19 hotspots in the country, second only to Mumbai in Maharashtra, the PMC with its staff of 15,000 people is in the forefront of the city’s response to the pandemic. Till Sunday evening, Pune had recorded 1,283 Covid-19 cases out of which 101 have died, 1,152 are active cases while 131 have recovered.“All our 42 departments are working round-the-clock to provide back-up services, apart from our medical teams, engineers and clerical staff,” said Agarwal.A ‘Command Control War Room’ has been established at the Smart City office to provide the PMC with a focused approach. A lot of emphasis is placed on generating and managing data to ensure areas where maximum efforts are needed, said Agarwal.“We are maximising our efforts in those areas from where the maximum number of positive cases are emerging and undertaking extensive surveys and testing. This is the reason why Pune has started getting more positive patients this week,” she said.Her day starts at 6 am and her morning exercise regimen consists mainly of Suryanamaskar. Some amount of team co-ordination happens from home and then she steps out for work. Even after she returns home in the evening, work continues over the phone right till midnight given the fast-changing scenario on the Covid-19 front. As the Smart City head, she is responsible for updated figures of Covid-19 positive patients, number of deaths and the extent of surveys conducted which is communicated to all the agencies concerned.With the health department under her charge, she needs to regularly review the available manpower and allocate staff as and where required. Her priorities include a review of contact tracing of positive patients and ensuring that quarantined people are taken care of in terms of food and medical attention.“I am also required to visit hospitals dedicated to Covid-19,” said Agarwal, pointing out that as the number of positive patients was increasing in Pune city, the number of quarantine facilities and isolation beds was being increased.She wears a mask, gloves and PPE (personal protective equipment) while visiting hospitals. Her main concern is to ensure that there is no sharp spike of new cases.“From where would I bring additional medical staff to handle the situation if it worsens?” she asks.“This is undoubtedly the most challenging situation in my entire service and in my life; but I am confident we will win this fight against Covid-19,” she says with a sense of purpose. An IAS officer of the 2008 batch, she has worked previously as the Zilla Parishad Chief executive officer and District collector at Jalgaon and as CEO of the Shirdi Sai Baba temple trust.Agarwal is grateful to the unstinted support of her family, municipal commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad, civic officials and staff and the district administration.While appreciating the work done by the doctors, nurses and health workers who are at the forefront of this battle, Agarwal says countless people working in the other departments and providing back-up support also deserve applause. These are the people who are working silently and organising the food, preparing hospitals and quarantine centres, going on the field for surveys, creating and managing shelter homes for migrant labourers and coordinating with corporates for assistance, she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/most-challenging-situation-says-ias-officer-leading-pune-s-covid-19-fight/story-pAdDNBtsJxN2MSEWeqMrhO.html

The UV disinfection tower (named UV Blaster) has been developed by Laser Science and Technology Centre (Lastec) with the help of New Age Instruments and Materials Private Limited, Gurugram. Lastec is a Delhi-based DRDO laboratory.“The UV Blaster is useful for high touch surfaces like electronic equipment in laboratories and offices that are not suitable for disinfection with chemical methods,” said the second official cited above.He said the system can also be operated remotely through the laptop or mobile phone using the Wi-Fi link. The UV blaster takes 10 minutes to disinfect a 12 by 12 foot room and 30 minutes for a 400 sq ft area. This system switches off automatically on accidental opening of the room or human intervention, the second official added.Different wings of the defence ministry, including the armed forces and the DRDO, have designed and developed a wide range of products to support the country’s effort to contain the spread of the pandemic.The DRDO has developed many products to combat the pandemic including ventilators, personal protective equipment (PPE) kits, large area sanitisation solutions and Covid-19 sample collection kiosks. Last month, the DRDO stepped forward to provide medical oxygen plants to hospitals in far-flung areas to help them generate their own oxygen supply.It has also developed a mobile virology research and diagnostics laboratory that will speed up coronavirus disease screening and other Covid-19 research and development activities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/drdo-develops-uv-disinfection-tower-to-fight-covid-19/story-zvIc0nrJaWZ69Sh2KRt3qK.html

The coated textiles can be primarily used to manufacture N95 masks, surgical masks, Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and food packaging bags, among others, with inherent properties of inactivating the coronavirus.Muse Wearables’ current pilot machine can coat textiles of length up to 100 metres within a few minutes, thereby making it a viable commercial solution that can be deployed immediately.Muse Wearables was incubated by IIT Madras Incubation Cell. Startup incubators are usually non-profit organisations that might be run by both public and private entities. Incubators are often associated with universities.“Our startups are working on a range of products that are vital to India and its fight against Covid-19, from N95 masks to intubation boxes and ventilators to affordable testing kits. They have quickly mobilized and repurposed their offerings in response to the situation and are striving to make a positive contribution to the nation and its anti-virus efforts. IITM Incubation Cell continues to assist its startups through these challenging times and hopes that industry support will help them ramp up their efforts in a more meaningful way,” said Dr Tamaswati Ghosh, chief executive officer, IIT Madras Incubation Cell, in a statement.Currently, Muse Wearables is assembling the coating machine and will shortly commence coating various textiles with different nanoparticle solutions. Their coated textiles is expected to be ready for testing by the first week of May 2020. The startup is also partnering with a mask manufacturing company to launch five-layered Antiviral N95 Masks.“Our solution tries to solve the current pandemic problem at the root level by inactivating coronavirus permanently. As soon as it comes in contact with the coated nanoparticles, its structure is permanently destroyed by the nanoparticles. For example, people using masks made by our coated textiles will not transmit the virus to others or have less chances of the virus getting transmitted to them,” said KLN Sai Prasanth, chief executive officer, Conzumex Industries, which operates the brand Muse Wearables.“Our coating process is scalable, which means it can be deployed in any textile industry as a textile finishing process. The solution we are developing are not confined to a research laboratory but can be used for commercial purposes,” he added.What’s the big deal about nano-particle coated textile?*Anti-microbial properties: it continuously captures and destroys viruses and other microbes upon contact*Other viruses as small as 30 nanometre can also be inactivated permanently*Does not leach while washing in water and is environment-friendly*At present can be coated on cotton, polyester and cotton–polyester*More fabrics will be tested soon*Non-toxic; can be safely used for making masks and other PPE||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-iit-madras-startup-eyes-special-method-for-coating-textiles-for-ppes/story-rGBXQzozWFmbppcJbHf36H.html

Railways have subsidized 85% and the state government is to pay 15%. The state governments can pay for the tickets (Madhya Pradesh’s BJP government is paying).

We’re dealing with biological systems, we’re not dealing with mechanical systems. It really depends so much on how the body reacts,” Nabarro said.“We’ve never accelerated a vaccine in a year to 18 months. It doesn’t mean it’s impossible, but it will be quite a heroic achievement. We need plan A, and a plan B,” Dr Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, told CNN.A vaccine candidate for Covid-19 has been identified by researchers at the Oxford Vaccine Group and Oxford’s Jenner Institute. The potential upcoming vaccine, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, is based on an adenovirus vaccine vector and the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.According to WHO, from a total of 102 candidate vaccines in the race, eight leading vaccines are in the human testing phase.A number of treatments are being tested for Covid-19 and scientists are also looking at experimental anti-Ebola drug remdesivir and blood plasma treatments are also being explored. Experts have said hydroxychloroquine, touted as a potential “game-changer” by US President Donald Trump, has been found not to work on very sick patients.Till then, Nabarro said preparing ourselves will be an option till a vaccine against Covid-19 is developed.“It’s absolutely essential that all societies everywhere get themselves into a position where they are able to defend against the coronavirus as a constant threat and to be able to go about social life and economic activity with the virus in our midst,” Nabarro said while speaking to CNN.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-might-never-have-a-vaccine-just-like-hiv-dengue-report/story-3E1BFQjOk2APEQiV482zVI.html

I got up early morning as there would be rush later and I cannot take a risk,” said Sachin Ghate, who lined up outside a liquor shop at Lalbaug in Mumbai at 6 am.Police rushed to the spot and dispersed the crowd asking people to come after the shops were opened.However, the liquor shops were not opened till noon as shopkeepers did not get any order.The Excise Department said the delay was due to technical issues.“We will issue the orders today itself to allow opening of wine shops in some time. We have resumed work after three days and have shortage of manpower. Hence it is taking time,” Excise Commissioner Kantilal Umap said.Wine shop owners in Mumbai said they will start operations only after getting the order from the district collector.The Maharashtra government on Sunday allowed the functioning of standalone liquor shops even in Covid-19 affected Mumbai and Pune - both in red zones. Shops selling liquor as well as non-essential goods will have to ensure six-feet distance between two people and not allow more than five people at a time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/customers-in-line-outside-liquor-shops-in-mumbai-since-6-am-authorities-yet-to-give-green-signal/story-X9MjgqzkP2XiPfKA4YgmvO.html
04-05-2020||India||Railway has subsidised 85 % fare for migrant workers: BJP||The BJP said on Monday the railways has subsidised 85 per cent of ticket fare for special trains being run to transport migrant workers and the state government has to pay the remaining 15 per cent, soon after the Congress attacked the central government over the issue. The state government concerned can also pay for the tickets, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said. He said the Madhya Pradesh government is doing so and asked Rahul Gandhi to tell the Congress-ruled states to follow suit. He was responding to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s attack on the railways for charging poor migrant labourers ticket fare, even as it donated over Rs 151 crore to the PM-CARES Fund.   “Rahul Gandhi ji, I have attached guidelines of MHA which clearly states that ‘No tickets to be sold at any station’. Railways has subsidised 85% & state govt to pay 15%. The state govt can pay for the tickets (Madhya Pradesh’s BJP govt is paying). Ask Cong state govts to follow suit,” Patra tweeted.  The BJP leader further clarified that for each ‘Shramik Express’, special trains being run for migrants, about 1,200 tickets to the destination are handed by the railways to the state government concerned.  State governments are supposed to clear the ticket price and hand over the tickets to workers, he said.  Seeking to corner the central government, the Congress on Monday said its state units will bear the cost of rail travel of needy migrant workers and labourers stranded at their workplaces due to the lockdown imposed to curb the spread of coronavirus. Congress president Sonia Gandhi in a statement announced the party’s decision and said this would be the Congress’ humble contribution in standing shoulder to shoulder with these workers.   In a tweet, BJP MP Subramanian Swamy claimed that migrant workers returning home will not have to pay money as the rail travel will be free from now onwards. Swamy, in a tweet, said, “Talked to Piyush Goel office. Govt will pay 85% and State Govt 15%. Migrant labour will go free. Ministry will clarify with an official statement.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/railway-has-subsidised-85-fare-for-migrant-workers-bjp/story-8GutHceQ7FByCrjLJ7sQJM.html

The Central team complained about the “limited field visits” facilitated by the state government. “The state government has taken an antagonistic view to the IMCT and has not supported the IMCT in the performance of its duties,” read the report.The team further alleged that their experience in Bengal contrasts with the experience of the IMCTs in other states.“The mortality rate of 12.8 % is by far the highest in the country. This extremely high mortality rate is a clear indication of low testing and weak surveillance and tracking,” the report noted.The team said they will be submitting the report to the union home ministry later today. “A discrepancy has been brought out in the number of Covid cases reported by the state in its medical bulletins and its communication with the government of India, said the report. “While the state has claimed very high level of daily surveillance of individuals in containment zones, no database was shown or results made available,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/be-transparent-don-t-downplay-coronavirus-spread-central-team-to-bengal/story-9mLp4zs2mNz0xZ1Hao9FEI.html

Soran has now tested negative for Covid-19 and is raring to go back to work – in the Covid-19 hotspot of Ramganj from where he got infected.The police constable is posted in Manak Chowk police station, one of the first police stations in Jaipur to go under curfew on March 24. He tested positive for the virus on April 10 and was admitted to SMS Hospital’s ward No. 4F.After two negative reports, Soran has now been taken to a quarantine centre on MI Road from. He will be discharged on May 7.“I want to return to work,” he said.Is he not scared of going back to work in Ramganj, which is Rajasthan’s biggest hotspot?“Darr thodi jayenge, sir. Duty to karenge hi (I will perform my duty without fear),” he said. “If the family says anything, I will explain to them that duty is duty in whichever area we have to perform it.”Ramganj neighbourhood of Jaipur has reported 598 out of 924 cases in Jaipur (as on May 2; the area-wise break-up of cases after May 2 is unavailable). Soran visited the area with medical teams and those distributing food packets. He was also on picket duty on some days.“Half of Ramganj is under the jurisdiction of my thana (Manak Chowk). We went there several times for work,” he said.Soran reported mild fever on April 6. It went away without medicine. On April 8, when a medical team came to Moti Ka Katla government dispensary, he went for voluntarily Covid-19 testing.“Some of us went for voluntary testing because we were working in a hotspot area. The report came on April 10. The SHO called me around 7 am to tell me that I had tested positive.

04-05-2020||India||In comeback to Sonia Gandhi, Centre points to 85% subsidy for migrant trains||Congress president Sonia Gandhi’s offensive over the railways charging stranded migrants for their return trip has drawn a strong rebuttal from the Centre. The railways ministry said they were charging state governments just 15% of the calculated train fare for the special trains and it was for the states to bear this cost or get the migrant workers to pay.“It is the stated position of the government that this facility has only been extended so that migrant workers who were stranded due to the lockdown could reach their destination. It was a limited relaxation to ease sufferings during the lockdown to help save lives, not spread the disease,” a senior railway board official said.Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Monday surprised the government and the BJP on Monday with a sharp attack that accused the Centre of forcing migrant workers to pay for tickets in this hour of crisis. She has asked Congress workers across the country to raise funds to pay for these trains.That call, one BJP leader said, appeared to be a “desperate attempt to revive the fortunes of the party rather than help the migrants”. There are at least two states - Nitish Kumar-ruled Bihar and Shivraj Singh Chouhan-led Madhya Pradesh - that have decided to fund rail travel of its workers. Kumar said the state had funded the travel of students who had returned from Kota in Rajasthan and will do the same for migrant workers as well. “They won’t have to pay anything,” he said.In a string of tweets, Chouhan also hit back at Gandhi declaring that she had been ill-advised. MP already has been paying for the trains, he said, asking the Congress to check what states ruled by her party were doing.Officials said the decision to charge 15% fare also was taken so that state governments did not end up incentivising travel of migrants.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe railways are bearing the 85% cost of running these migrant trains, the official said. In addition to the basic subsidies built into passenger fare, these trains only carry 60 per cent of the capacity due to social distancing norms, have accompanying teams of paramedics and railway security officers to ensure no one gets off midway and returns without passengers on the way back. Besides, there are costs incurred at the receiving and sending stations.Central government officials have, for days, been telling state governments not to encourage migrant workers to travel. It would not only slow down the economic revival process and make the recovery process longer but also could, as the World Bank had also warned south Asian countries, spread the vector across the region.On Friday, the Centre, however, gave in to pressure from state governments which had been demanding special trains to take the stranded workers home and operated the first train between Telangana and Jharkhand.Officials said the Covid-19 lockdown, however painful, was part of the containment process to check the spread of the Covid-19. This strategy has so far shielded the rural areas from the disease.The government had mandated that migrant workers returning home should be placed under home quarantine to protect the local population.But there have been several reports where villages have not allowed the migrant workers to return, insisting that they first go through the quarantine process at a facility on the outskirts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-comeback-to-sonia-gandhi-centre-points-to-85-subsidy-for-migrant-trains/story-5xZWkECgjJYWSCZ5kRayCP.html

The police claimed that the Nautanwa MLA misbehaved with them when he was stopped. “On being stopped by the police he confronted them and the health workers at the barricade. He also misbehaved with them while showing a pass issued by a senior bureaucrat of the Uttarakhand government stating that they should be allowed to visit the shrines to perform last rite rituals for CM Yogi Adityanath’s father, who had passed away recently,” said the official. The police, however, didn’t allow them to pass citing the closure of portals of Badrinath shrine after which they had to return. Later in the night, at around 11 pm, they were stopped by Muni ki Reti police, in Tehri Garhwal district, which booked Tripathi and his supporters. “Tripathi and 11 others were booked for violating the lockdown norms under relevant Disaster Management Act.

04-05-2020||India||Covid-19 update: Social distancing norms go for a toss as liquor stores lift shutters||Standalone wine stores and liquor shops opened shutters in parts of the country on Monday after more than a month amid the Covid-19 lockdown. Alcohol lovers thronged the shops with many violating the social distancing norms.In the national capital more than 100 people — not all observing social distancing measures — stood in line ahead of the reopening of a liquor store, news agency AP reported. Another liquor store in Old Delhi witnessed about 200 shoppers pushing and shoving each other until the Police intervened. “The government should just keep the liquor shops shut if such crowds are going to gather,” a Delhi resident was quoted by AP. Uttar Pradesh also saw long queues outside many liquor shops. People lined up since early morning to purchase alcohol, as early as 7 am. In Karnataka also, booze lovers thronged liquor stores hours before shutters went up at several places.At some places, they flocked liquor shops even before day-break and performed “special prayers” with flowers, coconuts, incense sticks, camphor and crackers in front of the stores, news agency PTI reported.     Large crowds gathered outside liquor shops across Maharashtra’s Pune city - one of the Covid-19 ‘red’ zones in the state. Mumbai and Pune are under the red zone but the state government notification said standalone liquor shops and those selling non-essential items would be allowed.Long queues outside liquor shops were seen in areas such as Bhandarkar road, Wanawdi, Salunke Vihar and NIBM road area in Pune. However, five districts in Maharashtra have decided not to permit liquor sale. Administrations of Solapur, Aurangabad, Jalna, Buldhana and Amravati districts have issued instructions that liquor shops will not be allowed to open, PTI reported. In Andhra Pradesh, liquor shops are open but a prohibition tax will be imposed to discourage people from consuming, said Special Chief Secretary to Industries and Commerce Department.

The man was discharged from the hospital, but is under home quarantine till May 11.“I was frightened of the disease besides being worried about my pregnant wife. However, doctors instilled confidence in me. Constant talks with family members on mobile helped me overcome the sense of fear and depression,” said the 32-year-old.According to the Union health ministry data on Monday, Jharkhand has recorded 115 Covid-19 positive cases, with three people having lost their lives to the pathogen.The railway employee, a trackman, is one of the two persons who till now have tested positive in Dhanbad district, popularly known as the coal city of the country. Both have recovered and now discharged from the hospital.The railway employee is now in home quarantine in his official residence at DS colony, which is under complete curfew since April 18.He is currently living alone as his wife and six-year-old son are with his in-laws in neighbouring Bokaro district. The man’s parents and his two siblings are in their native village in Bihar.His wife has been with her parents since before the lockdown. It had only been few days since he had returned from his in-law’s place to Dhanbad, that he was detected Covid-19 positive. His colony in heart of Dhanbad got converted into a containment zone.Over a dozen primary contacts, including his wife and son were tested, but all of them tested negative for the disease.“I broke down both emotionally and mentally when the doctor in divisional railway hospital (in Dhanbad) informed me that coronavirus has infected me. I had heard about the disease, and mostly bad things. Initially, I had lost hope of recovery. But after getting admitted at the Central Hospital (dedicated Covid-19 hospital), I felt better. Doctors and nursing staff were very encouraging,” said the trackman.Besides the doctors, he also remained in constant touch with his family members. He would call up his family members several times in a day.“I was worried for my wife and family members. But it comforted me when their reports came negative. There was no objection on using the phone any time of the day. Since it was easy to speak to my family members, they were also relieved,” he said.The railway employee said his colleagues and seniors also called him on few occasions to check his condition when in the hospital.He has now set a routine. “Since I am alone in the house, I have engaged myself in cleaning the quarter and other belongings to spend time. I also spend time watching TV besides cooking food and speaking to family members,” he added.On his immediate future plans after completion of his quarantine, he said while he would follow doctors’ prescription on health front. The man is, however, still undecided if he would meet his family soon after coming out of quarantine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/i-was-frightened-jharkhand-man-on-covid-19-battle-and-how-he-overcame-depression/story-lMyyLK30wsCS9WAOEDu2NM.html

The man asked them to get transit forms so that they could reach their native place in North India amid the coronavirus lockdown. He also charged Rs 200 and issued “receipts” but the trip was never made.Chandrashekhar Jadhav, a union leader, ran the Shramjeevi Kamgar Union at Jai Ambe Industrial Estate in Bhayander E, Maharashtra. He allegedly told migrants, who worked at many industrial units in the above area, to fill a transit form to reach their native place in north India. The migrants were charged Rs 200 each and were issued receipts, said PI Prakash Birajdar of Navghar police station.He even staged social distancing drill, as per rules, and the migrants believed him, said the official. “However, no forms were issued and the migrants lodged a complaint with us. We arrested him under Maharashtra Covid-19 Regulations, 2020 and Sections 269, 270 (spread of infectious disease) of the Indian Penal Coder. We arrested him on Sunday and released him on bail,” said Birajdar.Jadhav claimed that he has a clearance from the Mira Bhayander civic body to enlist names of migrants stuck in the twin cities. “We are investigating the matter and checking his previous criminal record as we have reports that Jadhav was earlier arrested in similar cases,” said Birajdar.Meantime, Sanjay Patil, Additional Superintendent of Police, Thane Rural, has warned people not to fall for such scams and inform the police about such fraudsters. The migrants should directly contact the District Collector, Thane online for the transit forms with all identity proofs and a medical certificate from by any approved government medical agency, Patil said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bhayander-union-leader-held-for-duping-migrants-promised-them-trip-to-native-place/story-Py2l7KncRyiUxPY7SSVoaO.html

Priyanka Gandhi’s tweets came hours after Sonia Gandhi, the Congress president and her mother, announced the party will pay for the train tickets of all such migrant workers and labourers who are taking special trains run by the Indian Railways.Sonia Gandhi, in a statement, had also criticised the government for not planning ahead before announcing the lockdown, which has now been extended up to May 17.“Workers are nation builders. But today they are struggling to make ends meet - this is a cause of agony for the entire country,” Priyanka Gandhi tweeted in Hindi.She also repeated the Congress president’s points to criticise the government—the Namaste Trump event in Ahmedabad in February and free air travel for Indians stranded abroad—as she posted on Twitter.“When we can bring back Indians stranded abroad in aeroplanes free of cost, when Namaste Trump can spend 100 crore from the government treasury in the program… ” she said. ..जब रेल मंत्री पीएम केयर फंड में 151 करोड़ रु दे सकते हैं तो फिर मजदूरों को आपदा की इस घड़ी में निशुल्क रेल यात्रा की सुविधा क्यों नहीं दे सकते? भारतीय राष्ट्रीय कांग्रेस ने निर्णय लिया है कि घर लौटने वाले मजदूरों की रेल यात्रा का पूरा खर्च उठाएगी। 2/2Priyanka Gandhi’s jibes were also aimed at Piyush Goyal, the railways minister.“When the railway minister can give Rs 151 crore to the PM-CARES Fund, then why can’t the workers get the facility of free rail travel in this hour of disaster?” she asked.“The Indian National Congress has decided that it will bear the full expenses of the rail journey of the workers returning home,” she added.Former Congress president and her brother Rahul Gandhi has also attacked the Centre for charging migrants for train tickets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/they-re-struggling-to-make-ends-meet-priyanka-gandhi-slams-centre-for-charging-migrants-train-fare/story-LLiFy6ELIdhz1gaB0wt1lJ.html
04-05-2020||India||India lodges strong protest with Pak over move to hold elections in Gilgit-Baltistan||India on Monday lodged a strong protest with Pakistan over a move to conduct elections in Gilgit Baltistan, with New Delhi saying the region is an integral part of the country that had been “illegally and forcibly occupied” by Islamabad.A senior Pakistani diplomat was served a “demarche”, or formal diplomatic representation over telephone, to lodge India’s strong protest against the Pakistani Supreme Court’s recent order allowing the setting up of a caretaker administration in Gilgit-Baltistan to hold fresh elections, people familiar with developments said.“It was clearly conveyed that the entire Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, including the areas of Gilgit and Baltistan, are an integral part of India by virtue of its fully legal and irrevocable accession,” the external affairs ministry said in a statement.“The Government of Pakistan or its judiciary has no locus standi on territories illegally and forcibly occupied by it,” it said.India claims the whole of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir, including the Gilgit-Baltistan region, which was given near-provincial status by the Pakistan government in 2009.On April 30, Pakistan’s Supreme Court allowed the government to amend the Government of Gilgit-Baltistan Order 2018 to set up a caretaker administration in the region to conduct fresh elections. The order was issued in response to a petition filed by the Imran Khan government.The term of the current government in Gilgit-Baltistan is set to end on June 24 and elections have to be held within 60 days.However, the external affairs ministry said India “completely rejects such actions and continued attempts to bring material changes in Pakistan-occupied areas of the Indian territory of Jammu and Kashmir”, and instead, Pakistan “should immediately vacate all areas under its illegal occupation”.“It was further conveyed that such actions can neither hide the illegal occupation of parts of Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh by Pakistan nor the grave human rights violations, exploitation and denial of freedom to the people residing in Pakistan-occupied territories for the past seven decades,” the statement said.The Indian government’s position on Gilgit Baltistan is reflected in the resolution passed by Parliament in 1994 by consensus, the statement added.The resolution described Jammu and Kashmir as an integral part of India and demanded Pakistan “must vacate” areas of the state “occupied through aggression”.The people cited above, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the demarche was read out over telephone in view of the Covid-19 lockdown. In normal circumstances, a diplomat can be summoned to the external affairs ministry to receive the demarche.Several other recent demarches were read out to Pakistani diplomats over telephone, the people said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-lodges-strong-protest-with-pakistan-over-move-to-hold-elections-in-gilgit-baltistan/story-v4v0xB5W2TPoLw8LAS08zJ.html

Assam shares a 267km border with Bangladesh, of which 90 km falls in Dhubri.“The Bangladeshi nationals were carrying valid travel documents. However, few of their visas had expired during the lockdown restrictions. They were travelling from Upper Assam’s Jorhat district with lockdown passes that were issued for migrant labourers. They’ve been placed in a quarantine facility in the district on Sunday,” said Anant Lal Gyani, deputy commissioner (DC), Dhubri district.The DC said that the 26 Bangladeshi nationals had entered India via the Changrabandha international border in West Bengal’s Cooch Behar district before the lockdown restrictions were enforced. Though they had T-1 visas meant for tourists, they told the officials in Dhubri that they were engaged in fishing activities in Jorhat, he added.“The two vehicles in which they’re travelling were intercepted in Dhubri on Sunday, as the passes issued to them from Jorhat were valid for travel only till the district. Besides, the local address in Dhubri furnished by the Bangladeshi nationals turned out to be fictitious. Later, they admitted that they’re trying to go back to their country,” Gyani said.Yuvraj, superintendent of police (SP), Dhubri district, said that all the relevant details of the Bangladeshi nationals have been shared with the Union Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) for the deportation process.“We’ll initiate the process of their deportation soon. They may be deported even before their mandatory 14-day quarantine period ends,” the SP said.Last month, Border Security Force (BSF) officials in Assam’s Karimganj district in the Barak valley had sent back a Bangladeshi national, who had swum across the Kushiyara river on the Indo-Bangla border in a bid to get himself treated in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-govt-initiates-deportation-process-for-26-bangladeshis-held-amid-lockdown/story-exNGf46ekmMdbextRtTsLI.html

E-commerce operations are allowed only for essential goods.MaharashtraThe Maharashtra government revised its order on Sunday, easing most of the restrictions on the industrial and commercial activities even in the urban areas mostly earmarked as Covid-19 red zones. The Maharashtra government allowed the shops and establishments dealing in non-essential commodities to open even in the 14 districts identified as red zones. The restrictions, however, will continue in the containment zones. This has paved the way for the operations of almost all the commercial activities including opening of liquor shops from Monday in the state.GujaratThe government has decided to grant no exemption in six cities and similar municipalities due to extreme cases of infection.A senior official said on Sunday that Chief Minister Vijay Rupani had decided against granting any relief in the municipal limits of Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara, Gandhinagar and Bhavnagar--all in ‘red’ zone, and Rajkot municipal corporation which falls under the ‘orange’ zone, news agency PTI reported.Also read: Lockdown 3.0 begins from today with more relaxations, some curbs“No relaxation will be allowed in the lockdown rules for another two weeks in municipal corporations of Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara, Gandhinagar, and Bhavnagar, as well as six municipalities of Botad, Bopal, Khabhnat, Bareja, Godhra and Umreth which are under ‘red’ zone (as per the Centre’s notification).”“No relaxation will be allowed in Rajkot municipal corporation as well, which is under orange zone.

The guidelines issued by the Union Home Ministry will be followed in Bihar. JharkhandThe state will not see any relaxation in the lockdown for the next two weeks. Chief Minister Hemant Soren said that the lockdown will remain the same in the state for the next two weeks. Students, workers and other people are coming back from outside in Jharkhand.

For this reason, the Government of Jharkhand has taken this decision as a precaution.RajasthanEight districts of Rajasthan are in the red zone. Mobile, laptop stationary and clothing shops will also open in the red zone. Facility to open OPD and medical clinic is also given in the ‘red’ zone. Construction workers who are on-site, 33% of employees in private offices, e-commerce have been allowed.

04-05-2020||India||Bengal allows 2 trains to carry back stranded people; Oppn targets it for going slow||Amid a spike in the number of people testing positive for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), West Bengal has decided to go slow in bringing back migrant workers stranded in different states.The state feels the return of so many people without Covid-19 tests needs to be planned with utmost care so that the infection does not spread to new areas through those coming back.West Bengal chief secretary Rajiva Sinha said no one coming from other states would be allowed to enter containment zones.“So, if someone taking a train for Bengal hails from a containment zone, he or she cannot be sent home. Some other arrangement needs to be made and these require time,” Sinha said.“It won’t be proper to allow lakhs of stranded migrants labourers all in one go. They need to be brought back in phases because detailed planning has to be made. Else every effort made till date will go down the drain,” Sinha added.The state, however, has started the inter-district movement of migrant workers stranded in different parts within the state.Despite the pressure being mounted on the government by opposition parties to fast-track the process of bringing back migrant workers, the government has so far given its nod to the entry of two special trains, one from Rajasthan carrying 1,200 pilgrims and the other from Kerala with migrant workers, to enter the state, as of Sunday evening. The train from Rajasthan will originate from Ajmer and stop at two places in West Bengal—Durgapur in West Burdwan district and Dankuni in Hooghly district—on May 5. The train from Kerala will start on May 4. Bengal on Sunday asked the government of Kerala to share the details of every passenger before the journey starts.While top officials of the state government remained tightlipped and there was no press briefing on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, Lok Sabha members of the Congress, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Left leaders have started contacting other states on their own to arrange for the return of the workers.“I spoke to railway minister Piyush Goyal, who said that Bengal has not applied for any special train but has given consent to let only two trains to enter the state. We are afraid the Bengal government’s delay in arranging for the return of the migrant workers would worsen their plight,” Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, the leader of Congress in the Lok Sabha and a lawmaker from West Bengal. Senior BJP leaders alleged that they had contacted the administration in Karnataka to organise the return of migrant workers stranded there but that the Bengal government did not respond.“Karnataka has already appointed an IAS officer as the nodal officer for dealing with the return of migrant workers to Bengal. But the state government did not contact officials in Karnataka as of Sunday evening,” Sukanta Majumdar, the BJP MP from Balurghat in West Bengal, said.“Bengal’s dillydallying on the issue of bringing back migrant workers, who are our own people, is scandalous. The Centre’s is also behaving in an inhumane way by charging train fare from migrants who stand virtually penniless. The state needs to expedite the process and the centre needs to facilitate,” Communist Party of India (Marxist) politburo member Md Salim said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-allows-2-trains-to-carry-back-stranded-people-oppn-targets-it-for-going-slow/story-efcebr2dnyVTWbF3zJyYwK.html

04-05-2020||India||Employee found guilty of misconduct can’t be treated equally with others: Bombay High Court||An employee found guilty in disciplinary proceedings cannot be treated equally with other employees having an unblemished track record, the Bombay high court said on Thursday while upholding the validity of a government resolution (GR) issued by the general administration department (GAD) keeping those punished for misconduct from the purview of consideration for promotion.“To qualify for a promotion, what is least expected of an employee is to have an unblemished record,” said the bench of justice SV Gangapurwala and justice Shrikant Kulkarni. “An employee found guilty of misconduct cannot be placed at par with other employees and his/her case has to be treated differently,” the court added and dismissed a petition filed by Mohan Sangvikar, a sub-divisional engineer with the public works department.Also read: ‘Conduct RT-PCR tests for Covid-19 frontline warriors,’ says Bombay HC Sangvikar had approached Maharashtra Administrative Tribunal (MAT) challenging the validity of a clause in a GR issued by the GAD on December 15, 2017, based on which he was declared unfit for promotion to the post of execution engineer. In April 2018, the departmental promotion committee has held him eligible as he was found guilty in a disciplinary proceeding. In November 2017, his increment was ordered to be withheld without any cumulative effect on his future increments.Sangvikar moved the high court after the MAT rejected his plea in March 2019. He challenged the validity of the GR contending that it was arbitrary, illegal and violative of the constitutional mandate of equality. It was also argued on his behalf that he could not have been denied a promotion, as no disciplinary proceeding was pending against him at the relevant time.The high court, however, rejected the argument. It said when an officer is found guilty in a departmental proceeding, the imposition of punishment is with an object to improve his conduct and to enforce discipline. “Denial of promotion in such circumstance is not a penalty but a necessary consequence of his conduct,” said the bench. The bench noted that the DLC took into consideration that at the relevant time, his punishment was not over. Besides, he had not been debarred for promotion and could be considered after the period of punishment is over in June 2020.“There is, therefore, no discrimination found in the matter of promotion of the present petitioner,” said the bench. “It cannot be expected from any administration to reward an employee with a promotion during his period of sentence. As such, we do not find any arbitrariness in the decision taken by the departmental promotion committee (DPC).”The bench also held that the policy contained in the GR was in larger public interest, keeping in mind difficulties faced by various departments dealing with such employees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/employee-found-guilty-of-misconduct-can-t-be-treated-equally-with-others-bombay-high-court/story-XeGnRgzCK6FhiF1IQYH1zN.html

Maharashtra witnessed loss in revenue receipts of more than Rs 41,000 crore (around 17-18% of the annual receipts) in March and April.The authorities, however, feel that the relaxation may lead to the largescale violations of lockdown norms in major cities like Mumbai, Thane and Pune that account for 90 per cent of the Covid-19 cases and may lead to surge in the spread of the disease.“The decision was reversed within 24 hours, eyeing at the revenue loss. However, it may become difficult for the authorities now to restrict the crowding in these cities. Sensing this, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has directed the officials to ensure strict implementation of the lockdown in these areas. It going to be tough in the urban areas,” said a senior government official.THe Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad have 88.9 per cent of the cases (11,538 of 12,974) and 86.1 per cent of the deaths (473 of 548) in the state as on Sunday. Mumbai alone has 1,577 containment zones, of which 533 have bee marked as red, 633 blue and 359 orange.Maharashtra, the worst-affected state in the country, has recorded 12,974 Covid-19 cases and 548 cases. of them, 8,800 cases and 343 deaths are reported in Mumbai alone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-lockdown-eased-in-hardest-hit-maharashtra-officials-wary-of-adverse-effect/story-9Rgw9nprLz2ebKgMIRVBIL.html

Solve this puzzle!,” Rahul Gandhi tweeted (roughly translated from Hindi).Congress interim President Sonia Gandhi had earlier today said that her party will bear the cost for rail travel of every needy migrant worker and labourer to their respective home towns during the lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-attacks-centre-for-charging-train-fare-from-migrant-labourers/story-OV38lKLVbHlfEaQqC6odjL.html

State capital Bhopal is next in terms of number of cases. There are 532 Covid-19 patients in Bhopal; the death toll stands at 15.Ujjain has 156 Covid-19 positive patients and 30 dead. The death rate of Ujjain is 26.92 per cent followed by Indore with 4.84 per cent and Bhopal with 2.81 per cent. The recovery percentage in Ujjain is 11.53 while in Indore it is 22.32 and Bhopal 44.54.Jabalpur, another divisional headquarters which has had 96 patients so far, has witnessed just one death but its recovery rate is slightly worse than that of Ujjain - 10.41 per cent.Chief minister’s instructions to authorities to send a special team to Ujjain came during a review meeting on Sunday.An official communiqué from the government said, “It was found during the review of Ujjain district that the death rate of Corona patients is the highest over there. We have to save every patient at any rate.”The chief minister also instructed the authorities to pay attention to Burhanpur too which has densely populated localities. Dhar administration was also instructed to be careful in the wake of the spread of Covid-19.Additional chief secretary, health department, Mohd Suleman said, “As many as 2,600 tests are being carried in 14 labs of the state now. On May 3, fifty positive cases were found out of 2,608 tests.”A BJP leader claimed the government took Ujjain situation seriously after the chief minister received complaint from party leaders that there was negligence in treatment of the 56-year-old BJP corporator who came from the minority community. He was admitted on April 20 and died on Sunday. He was active in distributing food packets among people in Covid-19 affected localities before he fell ill. However, public health expert Amulya Nidhi termed the state government’s move to send a special team to Ujjain as ‘too little and too late’.He said, “Ujjain’s situation has been grim for a long time. There was no adequate survey, screening, collection of samples and tests right from day one. There was inordinate delay in getting tests reports. Meanwhile, the virus was spreading alarmingly in certain localities under the very nose of the administration and health department. The government should immediately increase the number of tests and do a comprehensive survey and screening of people over there.”Meanwhile, the state government has decided not to charge fare from labourers being brought in trains from other states. The state government has also notified a toll free phone number 0755-2411180 on which people stranded in other states can seek assistance and information.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-indore-ujjain-in-madhya-pradesh-now-in-grip-of-covid-19-govt-deploys-special-team/story-vI3qc5v8nOOCVE8xRN6njL.html

04-05-2020||India||Congress will pay for rail travel of every needy migrant worker: Sonia Gandhi||Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Monday attacked the government for charging train tickets from migrant labourers going back to their homes and announced that her party will bear the cost for the rail travel of all such workers stranded due to the coronavirus lockdown.In a statement, she said it is disturbing that the central government and the rail ministry are charging them for train tickets in this hour of crisis.“But what is the responsibility of our government? Even today, lakhs of workers and migrant labourers are languishing in different parts of the country and wish to return to their homes and families but there is neither adequate money nor provision for free transport,” Gandhi said.Referring to the “Namaste Trump” event in Ahmedabad on February 24, Gandhi said when the government could spend nearly Rs 100 crore on transport and food for just one public programme in Gujarat, arrange free air travel for Indians stranded abroad and when the rail ministry has the largesse to donate Rs 151 crore to the PM’s Corona fund why can’t free rail travel be provided to migrant workers at this hour of acute distress.“Our workers and labourers form the backbone of our economy and the ambassadors of our nation’s growth. Their hard work and sacrifice are the foundation of our nation,” she added.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi too attacked the central government for charging train tickets from migrants. “On one hand, railways is charging fare from migrant labourers stuck in other sates, and on the other hand, the railways ministry is donating Rs 151 crore in PM-CARES fund. Please solve this riddle,” Rahul Gandhi said on Twitter in Hindi. एक तरफ रेलवे दूसरे राज्यों में फँसे मजदूरों से टिकट का भाड़ा वसूल रही है वहीं दूसरी तरफ रेल मंत्रालय पीएम केयर फंड में 151 करोड़ रुपए का चंदा दे रहा है।जरा ये गुत्थी सुलझाइए! pic.twitter.com/qaN0k5NwpGSonia Gandhi, meanwhile, said in her letter that the central government barely gave a four-hour notice of the lockdown, thus denying workers and migrant labourers the opportunity to return to their homes.“Post the partition of 1947, this is the first time India witnessed a tragedy with such a massive human cost as thousands of migrant workers and labourers were forced to walk home several hundred km on foot- without food, without medicines, without money, without transportation, without anything except for the desire to return to their families and loved ones,” she said.“The very thought of their plight is enough to break our hearts as there was also the outpouring of support from fellow Indians for their inspiring resolve.”Gandhi said the Congress has been raising this issue from the outset of the lockdown and sought provisions for the safe and free rail travel of migrant workers and labourers to their home-towns.“However, despite our repeated demands, the central government and the rail ministry have chosen to completely ignore the same,” she added.Gandhi said the Congress has taken a decision that all its state units will bear the cost for the rail travel of every needy worker and migrant labourer and take necessary steps in this regard.“This will be the Congress’ humble contribution in service of our compatriots and to stand shoulder to shoulder in solidarity with them,” she said.Shortly after her letter, Congress treasurer Ahmed Patel asked all the state units to mobilise all possible local resources. “As directed by Congress President,in my capacity as Treasuer (AICC) I request Pradesh Congress Committees to mobilise all possible local resources to help migrants purchase tickets to get back home,” Patel said on Twitter.He added that it’s time to turn this into a people’s movement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-will-pay-for-rail-travel-of-every-needy-migrant-worker-sonia-gandhi/story-XSQp8dC4DZYiN6iajTt7PM.html

For the family of Danika Chaudhary, her first birthday was that moment.The Covid-19 lockdown made it impossible for Chaudhary’s father Arun Tomar to celebrate her first birthday on a grand scale in Kota. But the city police ensured they don’t miss out on fun.Additional SP, Kota, Headquarter, Rajesh Kumar Meel along with his securitymen wearing masks and gloves arrived at the residence of Tomar in Kota on Monday where they gifted the baby girl Danika Chaudhary a birthday cake.Tomar and his family was in surprise and awe of the Kota cops’ gesture.“We did not expected this and it was a welcome move. Since it was the first birthday of our daughter, we were emotional about it but Kota police made the day for us,” said Tomar, who works as a radio jockey.Tomar further said that the family had decided to celebrate the baby’s first birthday at home because no grand celebrations are allowed during the lockdown.Additional SP Meel said that Tomar had met him a few days ago and talked about not being able to celebrate her daughter’s first birthday. “So we decided to give our blessings by visiting them,” he said.Rajasthan reported three more coronavirus deaths on Sunday, while 114 people tested positive for the virus.Of the 114 new cases, 40 are from Chittorgarh, 32 from Jaipur, 27 from Jodhpur, five from Udaipur, three from Ajmer, two each in Bharatpur, Kota and Pratapgarh and one from Dungarpur, according to a state government official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kota-police-surprise-family-of-birthday-girl-stuck-inside-due-to-covid-19-lockdown/story-h7cMb1Gaa2kLBj2OBhD8FP.html

The state government had empowered the two district collectorates to enlist the number of labourers stranded in Goa because of the Covid-19 lockdown and who were seeking to return home, following which these people signed up to be ferried back home.They include 18,000 migrant workers from Karnataka, 17,000 from Uttar Pradesh and 11,000 from Bihar. “We are in talks with the railways authorities and special trains will be arranged which will begin from one station in Goa and culminate at a station in UP and Bihar,” Sawant said while addressing a press conference. He, however, didn’t elaborate on when these arrangements will be finalised only saying that the departure of the trains will be announced publicly. Sawant also urged the labourers to continue to remain in the state saying that after economic activities resume, workers, especially in the construction sector, will be in short supply. The government also welcomed Goa residents who have been stranded at different parts of the country and wish to travel to the state on their own but cautioned they will be taken to the quarantine centre once they are back and will be kept there until the results of their swab tests are in and reported negative. More than 3,000 Goans are seeking to return home, many of whom are willing to come back in their own vehicles and have registered online for transit permits on the Goa government website. “After that, we will send them home with a home quarantine stamp mandating that they quarantine themselves at home for 14-days,” Sawant.While those who show residence proof will be quarantined for free, those who are not ideally residents of Goa but need to visit because of emergencies, including the ill health of relative, and for work reasons will be allowed in the state but will have to pay Rs 2,500 per day for their 14-day quarantine in a hotel. “We will not be liberally issuing permissions to persons for whom Goa is not home. Only in the case of emergencies, they will be allowed as an exception,” Sawant said.Earlier this week, around a hundred labourers converged at a railway station after word spread that trains were being arranged to take them back to their home state, necessitating the intervention of the police to help them return to their homes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/71-000-stranded-labourers-seek-to-leave-goa-transport-being-arranged-cm-sawant/story-SpkcOrZez0Y0QgvRYn95TK.html
04-05-2020||India||Covid-19 lockdown: Key services to resume in Delhi today||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday said that his government was allowing self-employed people including domestic help, those involved in laundry services, technicians, electricians and plumbers to operate in the national capital from Monday, when the third phase of the national lockdown over the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) kicks in with considerable relaxations.The Delhi government released its implementation strategy over the guidelines released by the Union home ministry, with Kejriwal saying that the Capital will follow the lockdown restrictions enforced by the Centre. He, however, urged the central government to lift restrictions in the Capital’s areas that have largely remained unaffected by the disease. The Union government announced on Friday that the lockdown, necessitated by the infectious outbreak, was being extended by two weeks till May 17.Detailing the Delhi government’s plan at a news briefing on Sunday, Kejriwal said: “Self-employed people – technicians, plumbers, electricians, mechanics, sanitation staff, people working as domestic help, laundry, dhobis – people like these the permission to work.”The Delhi CM also said print and electronic media, IT-related services, call centres, data centres, warehousing services, cold storages, private security firms and industrial estates with access control will also be allowed to remain open. Elevator technicians, AC mechanics, vehicle mechanics, generator mechanics and TV mechanics will also be allowed to work from Monday. The Delhi chief minister on March 23 announced a complete lockdown in the Capital to contain Covid-19, which has severely hit metropolises across the world, days before the central government announced similar restrictions across the nation.While public health experts say the lockdown was needed to control the disease from spiralling out of control, there have been concerns over stalling economic activity. Kejriwal said on Sunday Delhi was reporting heavy revenue losses and it was important to reopen areas largely outside the spectre of the pathogen to ensure people don’t travel back to their hometowns because of the lack of employment. Currently, there are 94containment zones in the national capital.The Delhi CM said that people were losing jobs and traders were suffering because there was no business. He, however, reiterated the Centre’s rule on people not being allowed to step out of their homes for non-essential activities from 7pm to 7am.Kejriwal said government offices and private facilities with 33% staff will open from Monday but the suspension of travel by air, metro and bus will continue. Delivery of essential goods through e-commerce portals will continue in the national capital, he said.“Malls, cinemas, salons, market complexes and Delhi Metro will remain shut while shops selling essentials will continue will be open,” he said, adding that 50 people will be allowed in marriage function. Movement of individuals and vehicles is allowed only for permitted activities, with a maximum of two persons (besides the driver) in four-wheeler vehicles, and with no pillion rider in the case of two-wheelers.Shortly after Kejriwal’s announcement, residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) in Delhi said they were open to letting electricians and plumbers enter the residential complexes, but expressed concern over domestic help resuming work.Rajiv Kakria, convener, Save Our City campaign, said the Delhi government’s decision came just a day after the city reported the highest number of Covid-19 cases in a single day. “If the government ensures that the situation is conducive and there are zero movements from containment zones, then it can be eased. But it is better to wait and see how the situation pans out,” he said. “Domestic help work in at least 5-6 households… It is risky, especially now when the cases are spiralling up,” he added.Madhur Srivastava, RWA president, Sector-4 DDA colony of Dwarka, said: “We have a designated electrician, plumber and a person who irons clothes. We used to allow residents to use services from outside but that will strictly be banned now.”The Delhi government, RWAs say, has allowed self-employed people to work but without making any provision for their commute. “Public transport is not allowed, then how will they come?” said Atul Goyal, president URJA, a united front of a group RWAs in Delhi.Reacting to the latest relaxations, Dr Lalit Kant, former head of epidemiology and communicable diseases at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said: “When these people come for one, they should ensure to wear a mask while working and wash their hands before starting the work. If there are elderly people or children at home, then they should be kept away as chances of them contracting the infection are high in case the domestic help is infected but asymptomatic.”Dr Jugal Kishore, head of community medicine at Safdarjung Hospital, welcomed the government’s decision to allow self-employed people working as domestic help. “This decision will help both, as there are people, especially the elderly, who are finding it difficult to manage the household without any help. It will also provide financial stability to domestic help. People should teach them how to protect themselves from the disease.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/key-services-to-resume-in-delhi-today/story-r1nVyt0m9QjiiGeTNe3m0M.html
04-05-2020||India||Prison authorities told to allow video calls between jail inmates, their kin||Worried over coronavirus disease (Covid-19) infection spread in country’s overcrowded prisons, the ministry of home affairs on Sunday issued fresh guidelines for detained, convicted and undertrials.The government has ordered that all the Mulaqats – meeting between the prisoners and their family members, be stopped till the pandemic is controlled and that video calls/phone calls be allowed. The prisons have also been asked to stop all group activities of the inmates barring crucial ones with social distancing measures.It also asked all the states’ chief secretaries and prison heads to earmark separate building as a holding area for those detainees who might have had a history of foreign travel or exposure to Covid-19 patients. The jail staff members who are showing any Covid-19 symptoms must not be allowed entry the jail, the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) issued along with the order stated.The MHA decided to issue detailed guidelines for prisons after close to two dozen cases of infections were reported at Indore jail in Madhya Pradesh.“People in prisons and other places of detention, living in closed and crowded environment, are likely to be more vulnerable to the coronavirus disease. Moreover, experience shows that prisons, jails and similar settings where people gather in close proximity may act as a source of infection and spread of infectious diseases within and beyond prisons. Any control strategy for Covid-19 in the community which does not encompass the prison context will not be sustainable,” Home secretary Ajay Bhalla stated in his letter.For the prisoners who are moving in and out daily, MHA has recommended that a daily diary be maintained.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/prison-authorities-told-to-allow-video-calls-between-jail-inmates-their-kin/story-9KJFx6oot1DE8dfZchX17O.html
04-05-2020||India||India tally over 40k, 427 new cases in city||The number of Covid-19 cases in India crossed 40,000 and the national capital saw its highest single-day spike on Sunday, with the contagion in the country largely driven by urban hot spots, even as the central and state governments sketched out plans to relax some of the lockdown curbs in low-risk areas from Monday while putting in place measures to prevent a jump in infections.According to data by state health departments, 2,616 new patients were diagnosed on Sunday, taking the country’s total tally to 42,527 cases including 1,393 fatalities. Delhi on Sunday reported 427 new cases, its highest increase in one day, as the number of infections in the Capital rose to 4,549 including 64 deaths. While cases across the country have steadily increased since March, the latest 10,000 infections were recorded in 5 days, two days fewer than it took for the tally to go from 20,000 to 30,000. It took about 43 days for India to record its first 10,000 positive cases. Of these, the three worst-hit states -- Maharashtra, Gujarat and Delhi -- accounted for 56.5% of the fresh infections, signalling how metropolises have become breeding grounds of the highly infectious disease that has ravaged countries worldwide and brought the global economy to a standstill.The Union government has maintained that the country is on the right path in controlling the infections and that the spread of Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, is slowing down. Data shows that India’s doubling rate — the average period it takes for infections to double — has gone up from four days at the beginning of April to around 11.5 days as of Sunday.“If in last 14 days, the doubling rate was 10.5 days, then today it is around 12 days,” Union health minister Harsh Vardhan told reporters in Delhi on Sunday. He said India’s mortality rate, which is 3.2%, is among the lowest in the world, and added that the country was “on the path of success” to win the “war” against Covid-19.At 12,947, Maharashtra has the most number of Covid-19 cases in the country, of which 8,800 are in India’s financial capital Mumbai. Authorities fear that the number of infections could balloon if the disease spreads in Mumbai’s Dharavi , the slum colony that has 850,000 residents and where about 590 cases have been reported so far.Maharashtra is followed by Gujarat, with 5,428 cases recorded till Sunday. Other cities such as Madhya Pradesh’s Indore (over 1,500 cases) and Uttar Pradesh’s Agra (over 500 cases) have also emerged as hot spots. While public health experts have lauded India’s action in enforcing strict nationwide lockdown on March 25, when there were just over 500 positive cases, they say the next few weeks will be crucial for the country to flatten its curve of infections so the health care system is not overwhelmed.The developments come a day before the 3rd phase of the nationwide lockdown comes into effect. Although the Centre extended the lockdown till May 17, it has allowed relaxations according to zones – red, orange and green – that are categorised by the perceived risk of the disease’s spread.“The challenge ahead lies that cases do not leak from red or orange zones into green zones as then we can say the curve has truly flattened... In many ways, the map of India will change for a few months, and your actions will evolve based on the colour coding of country’s map,” said Dr Randeep Guleria, director of AIIMS Delhi and member of the national task force for Covid-19 outbreak.To ensure that India is prepared to handle a spike in infections, the Centre has scaled up health infrastructure and testing capabilities. A total of 1,046,450 tests were conducted by Sunday, with over 74,000 samples being tested daily, according to the health ministry. “Our strategy remains to strengthen surveillance, effective contact tracing, and scaling up testing so that all positive cases are traced, tested, isolated and treated, and to cut the chain of transmission,” said a senior health ministry official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-tally-over-40k-427-new-cases-in-city/story-qFRBQSIYnYLDhlBPq8dJ6J.html
04-05-2020||India||Haffkine Institute gets approval for BCG trial||The Haffkine Institute got permission to run clinical trials of the anti-tuberculosis Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine to treat Covid-19 patients. The trials will be conducted at BJ Medical College, Pune. The institute in Mumbai’s Parel had submitted the proposal to the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) last month as a therapeutic treatment. “The vaccine helps to improve the immune system among people, so it is believed that it can be used as a therapeutic treatment for patients with Covid-19. Preliminary research has shown that it has helped to neutralise the virus to some extent,” said Dr. Sanjay Mukherjee, secretary, Medical Education and Drugs Department (MEDD).Around 35 people with moderate and severe infection will be part of the trial. Dr. Usha Padmanabhan who currently heads the Department of Cell Biology at Haffkine Institute will be in-charge of the trial. Dr Rajesh Deshmukh, managing director of the Institute said, “Unlike other new drugs, it would be easier to treat patients as this vaccine is already available in markets. We have already set up the laboratory for the trial at the college.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/haffkine-institute-gets-approval-for-bcg-trial/story-2sgLGdF7U0Foodf19J4t7J.html
04-05-2020||India||Forest panel to share its views on Etalin Hydropower Project soon||The minutes of environment ministry’s forest advisory committee (FAC) of April 23 when they considered granting forest clearance the contentious Etalin Hydropower project of 3097 MW in Arunachal Pradesh’s Dibang Valley, will be made public next week. But, senior environment ministry officials said the FAC hasn’t taken a decision on whether to reject or allow the project yet.The environment ministry’s forest division has been overwhelmed in the past week by letters and submissions on the project which will involve clearing of at least 2.7 lakh trees. After several conservation scientists and researchers wrote to FAC about losing a significant tiger habitat and biodiversity rich sub-tropical evergreen and rainforests, the Idu Mishmi community of Dibang valley has also started petitioning the FAC.“We have received some letters which are in favour of the project and some which are not. We plan to release the minutes of our discussion in FAC meeting next week but a decision is still not taken. We require more information. We will address the concerns raised by scientists and conservationists at an appropriate time,” said Sanjay Kumar, director general of forests.Among several petitions received by the ministry, the Project Affected People Forum who are residents of the valley near Tangon and Dri tributaries of Dibang river where concrete gravity dams will be constructed, also wrote to the ministry. The petition said that scientists and researchers with “anti-development mindset” are trying to sabotage the project by running a signature campaign against it.The members of the forum said that the project will be critical for the remote region which has been neglected by the government. “There are no basic services like proper healthcare services, schools here. When the project comes up people will get jobs. This is a very remote area. The project is also important for Arunachal Pradesh which has no source of revenue generation. There are no big industries here. China across the border has already built several dams on the rivers,” said Rohit Mele, chief advisor of the forum over phone.More importantly, 250 families have been assured compensation under the land acquisition act which hasn’t come through yet. “Land acquisition has been completed and detailed project report made. All technical formalities are over except forest clearance and environmental clearance. These families are waiting for compensation,” added Mele who said that the project developers (Etalin Hydro Electric Power Company Limited, a joint venture of Hydro Power Development Corporation of Arunachal Pradesh Limited and Jindal Power Limited) have assured that there will be no major environmental or biodiversity impact from the project.Another group of Idu Mishmi people in a different letter to FAC highlighted that the project threatens the culture and heritage of local people.Referring to a Wildlife Institute of India (WII) report commissioned by the FAC which found that there are no tigers in the community forests outside the Dibang Wildlife Sanctuary, the letter said: “There are several omissions and contradictions in the findings of WII. Arguing that tigers are not found in the community forest outside of Dibang Wildlife Sanctuary is a total disrespect of our community’s knowledge and traditions. In reality it is a fact that parents and elders of the Mishmi community have always narrated to their children how they have witnessed tigers with their own eyes. It is we the locals who have experienced, known and managed this land for centuries,” the letter by Kera-aa Initiatives for Cultural and Ecological Security, Mishmi Hills said.Anoko Mega, member of the Arunachal Pradesh Wildlife Board in his letter dated May 2 to FAC said that the Talon river is sacred to the community and the souls of those departed.“The population of the Idu Mishmi community is less than 15,000 individuals. We are aminority tribal group and the Dibang Valley is our homeland…despite mass protests from our community, India’s biggest dam – Dibang Multipurpose Project - has already been approved on the Dibang river. Between both dams it is expected that 6 lakh trees will be cut down. With the destruction of the Dibang Valley, where will my community turn and what will be left for our future generations?” he asked.According to FAC’s own factsheet, the project falls under the richest bio-geographical province of the Himalayan zone and falls under one of the mega biodiversity hotspots of the world. The proposed project location falls at the junction of the Paleoarctic, Indo-Chinese, and Indo-Malayan bio-geographic regions having luxuriant forests and plethora of flora and fauna. It is also a “vital tiger area.”HT had written to Jindal Power Limited on April 29 about a response on the ecological concerns raised by conservationists but the company hasnt responded to the query yet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/forest-panel-to-share-its-views-on-etalin-hydropower-project-soon/story-ohYk0xwKdSh0V0tkPUQmDP.html
04-05-2020||India||Centre rushes 20 health teams to 20 districts||The Union health ministry said on Sunday it was deploying 20 central teams to coronavirus disease (Covid-19) hot spots including Delhi and Mumbai to assist in controlling high caseloads and helping the state governments in their strategies against the contagion.The move comes days after the Union home ministry sent Inter-Ministerial Central Teams (IMCTs) to states where the situation was “especially serious”. The central teams have flagged areas of concern in the states over the battle against Covid-19 and suggested remedial measures.“The teams of experienced specialists were constituted over the weekend and are being sent to the states from where maximum cases are being reported. These teams will assist the state government in surveillance, implementing effective contact tracking measures, case management and infection control,” said a senior health ministry official on Sunday, asking not to be named.The severely hit districts where these 20 teams will work with state experts are Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Delhi (south-east and central districts), Indore, Pune, Jaipur, Thane, Surat, Chennai, Hyderabad, Bhopal, Jodhpur, Agra, Kolkata, Kurnool, Guntur, Krishna and Lucknow. “These teams will support the states in implementation of containment measures for Ccovid-19 in the affected areas within these districts/cities. The teams shall assist the state governments,” a statement by the health ministry said.Another official said these are districts with high cumulative positive figures, cases doubling too frequently or high death rates.According to the health ministry’s revised list on Saturday, 130 districts across the country are “red zone” or hot spots of the disease. While there are 284 “orange zones”, 319 districts are “green zone”, which have largely remained outside the spectre of the highly contagious disease.All major metropolitan cities such as Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Ahmedabad, are now “red zones” as they have been reporting high caseloads and infection clusters.The states of Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra have the highest number of “red zones” at 19 and 14 respectively, followed by Tamil Nadu at 12. All of Delhi’s 11 districts are hot spots.The new list has been prepared by including factors such as incidence of testing, level of testing, and population density of the area. “This is a dynamic list that gets revised on a daily basis as the outbreak is a highly evolving situation,” an official said on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-rushes-20-health-teams-to-20-districts/story-KQvuHLH5GGWb57Yv0jw7HI.html
04-05-2020||India||Thundershowers, hail and strong winds will affect northwest India for 2 more days||Thundershowers and hailstorms have started affecting several parts of northwest India as forecast by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) last week. Strong winds and thundershowers is likely to continue impacting the region on Monday and Tuesday due to an intense western disturbance and moisture incursion from both the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal.“There is heating in many parts of the country and (also) a lot of moisture incursion from the Arabian Sea. All conditions are favourable for thunderstorm activity over northwest India. Western Disturbances (WDs) pass through the region round the year, but this time we are also seeing some intense WDs,” said M Mohapatra, the director general of IMD.IMD’s Sunday bulletin said due to strong southeasterly and easterly winds from May 3 to 6 in the lower levels over northern plains of India, along with fresh moisture incursion from both the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal, fairly widespread rain and thunderstorms as well as lightning and gusty winds (30-40 kmph) is likely over this region. Peak activity over the Western Himalayas is likely on May 4 and 5, while peak activity over the northern plains, including Uttarakhand, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi and western Uttar Pradesh is likely on May 5.“Already hailstorm has started impacting south Haryana and some parts of Rajasthan. Rest of the northern states are experiencing thunderstorms and rain. This year we had a pattern of unusually high number of WDs since January, when there were nine WDs against a normal of three-four. In April there were seven WDs,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head of regional weather forecasting centre. “It’s too early to link it with climate change. We have to see if this pattern sustains for a few years,” he added.Scientists earlier told HT that such changes in the WD pattern may be due to weather anomalies in Europe, because WDs originate as low-pressure systems in the Mediterranean or they could also be linked to favourable sea temperatures over the Pacific.The maximum temperature on May 2 reached 44 to 45 degrees C in parts of Vidarbha, Marathwada and southwest Madhya Pradesh. Heat wave conditions are likely to develop over these areas in the next three-four days, according to IMD. Also, Cyclone ‘Amphan’ may develop over the south Andaman Sea in the next three-four days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/thundershowers-hail-and-strong-winds-will-affect-northwest-india-for-2-more-days/story-0l9JPkdmm1HpCDAz60r21K.html
04-05-2020||India||Restaurants stare at uncertain future as customers may not have the stomach to dine out||Since the second week of March, restaurants, pubs and discotheques across the world have shut down as the first signs of the Covid-19 pandemic taking hold emerged. Nearly two months later, owners are unsure when they will be able to reopen their outlets and what their business would be like once they do.A combination of risks has made this segment of the hospitality business particularly vulnerable to the crisis, with infections feared to spread in closed, indoor spaces – which most eateries are – and through multiple points of contact, whether the food, the dishes or even furniture on an average day filled with multiple customers.“The problem is at two levels. How do you comply with social distancing rules in restaurants, where putting a distance of say 1-2 metres between tables will be difficult, and how do you convince people that the food that they will be served is safe,” said Anurag Katriar, president of the National Restaurants Association of India (NRAI) and CEO of deGustibus that runs Mumbai’s Indigo chain of restaurants.Nightclubs, bars and the banqueting business will be particularly affected, the NRAI president said, since these depend on large crowds.The coronavirus disease has been established to spread in closed spaces like restaurants, with one such instance taking place in Guangzhou, China, where nine people contracted the disease from a fellow diner. Crucially, dozens of others present in the eatery at the time did not get the disease, which health authorities said was because the infections were spread only among those who were sitting within the draught of the same air conditioner as the infected person.At least three American provincial officials – in New York, Connecticut and Atlanta – have hinted at letting restaurants expand to streets outside, which will be closed to vehicles to make more room for pedestrians and cyclists as an alternative to more risky mass transit.“I think such a dining option is a good way out for restaurants at present, but in congested cities like Mumbai, this will be difficult,” Katriar said.The new normal, Katriar added, will depend on how severely India is hit by the pandemic. “If India emerges with, say, 2,000 casualties, it will be very different from a situation if there are 20,000 casualties,” he said. “If the disease takes a big toll, people will be reluctant to go out to eat for a long time,” he added.For the time being, according to the restaurateur, businesses could look at carrying out regular batch testing and disclosing the results to make customers feel safe about eating out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/restaurants-and-eateries-stare-at-uncertain-future-as-customers-may-not-have-the-stomach-to-dine-out/story-uYUFsPoN57JxMnKRHkXZLI.html
04-05-2020||India||Kerala plans reverse quarantine for elderly||Kerala, the state with the lowest Covid-19 mortality and highest recovery rate in India, is set to take the fight against the viral pandemic to the next stage by implementing a “reverse quarantine” to protect its elderly and people ailing with medical conditions that make them susceptible to the virus.The state, which on January 30 was the first in India to report a coronavirus case, is seeking to preserve the impressive gains it had made in the battle against the pathogen, which has affected 499 people, of whom 95 are active patients. Four have died. A blueprint for the reverse quarantine has already been prepared and health workers have started monitoring the medical conditions of the elderly and people whose immunity may have been compromised and left them susceptible to Covid-19 by existing health conditions.Experts say reserve quarantine refers to a practice of isolating the most vulnerable people -- those of advanced age and under treatment for existing ailments -- from the rest of the population and monitoring their health closely to protect them from infection.“In Kerala, we have 70 lakh people who are above 65 years of age and suffer from diabetes, cancer, blood pressure, heart ailments, kidney disease and respiratory tract infections. They are sitting ducks. Our priority is to detach them from others and protect them,” said Dr B Iqbal, who heads an expert panel that advises the state government on prevention of the coronavirus disease.“In case of a community spread we can isolate vulnerable population and check their mortality rate effectively unlike what happened in some of the western countries. We have formed grassroots committees to monitor their health conditions. Besides local body members, Asha {accredited health activist} workers, resident association office-bearers, youth volunteers and local police officers will be part of these committees,” he said.The plan is being implemented at a time when Kerala is preparing to receive, once flights resume, citizens from the state who are either stuck overseas, mainly in the Middle East, or have lost their jobs.Family members of Keralites settled abroad, pregnant women and students of Indian origin who want to pursue higher education at home are among the 300,000 people who have registered on a website opened by the Kerala government for such people last week.Some returnees from overseas locations n March had turned super spreaders after jumping home quarantine, prompting the state to adopt a more cautious approach this time. Experts like Dr. Iqbal say that a reverse quarantine is a viable option until an effective vaccine is found for Covid-19. Once a person is in put in reverse quarantine, a separate room with a toilet is given to him or her and their interaction with other family members is limited. Social distancing norms and face masks are a must. In north Kerala, many cancer patients have already been put in reverse quarantine.“Since it is a new virus we need a multipronged strategy to deal with it. Reverse quarantine is one among them. We can’t say how long the virus will be active and {when the local population will} achieve herd immunity. So we can isolate people who are more prone to it. As Kerala is an informed society it is better to practise it here,” said epidemiologist Dr Jayaprakash Muliyil, also former principal of the Christian Medical College, Vellore.A sense of deprivation and neglect can set in among those prescribed reverse quarantine, and it has to be addressed by family members and medical counsellors. Some areas, especially north Kerala, have strong palliative care services and volunteers from the region can be used elsewhere to tend to patients, said Dr Iqbal.“We can’t live in a lockdown like this for long. We have to live with it till a vaccine is found. So we have to evolve a mechanism to suit this. Like social distancing, reverse quarantine is a way to check the mortality rate,” said another expert, adding the key is “minimum exposure” of the vulnerable to the outside world. In so-called red zones,a ban has been enforced on people above 65 and children below 10 years stepping out of their houses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-plans-reverse-quarantine-for-elderly/story-eo2kSbNaNWEKZjMlqRIaCJ.html
04-05-2020||India||Need to reboot health care system to also focus on non-Covid patients||Many hospitals that had shut down non-essential care services and postponed elective surgeries to lower crowding and free up health staff to treat coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patients will begin working to capacity once the lockdown lifts, but operations are unlikely to return to what they were before. “Hospitals have and must adapt and evolve to treat patients with and without Covid-19, to ensure no one dies because of lack of treatment. Elective procedures can be postponed for a while, but they cannot be postponed indefinitely. We’re already seeing complications of gall bladder stones getting septic and people getting heart attacks, which could have been averted. Separated Covid-19 hospitals and wards, and strong infection-control and crowd management protocols will ensure patients and health staff will stay protected,” said Dr Naresh Trehan, who heads Medanta-The Medicity, Gurugram.Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as heart disease, cancers, diabetes and chronic kidney disease account for around 61.8% in 2016, as compared to 37.9% in 1990, of all deaths in India, according to Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) report: India - Health of the Nation’s States 2018. With social distancing being the new normal, reduced movement associated with social distancing and unhealthy snacking is threatening to aggravate risk factors for NCDs, such as obesity, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, and high cholesterol.“A month of being cooped up indoors would not have caused irreversible health damage, but it will if it continues. Outdoor physical activity must be consciously re-initiated once movement restrictions are slowly lifted. More effort must be made to commence outdoor activity with basic precautions, such as wearing masks and not moving in groups,” said Dr Nikhil Tandon, professor and head of the department of endocrinology and metabolism, All India Institute of Medical Sciences.What needs as much attention is the absence of routine, and anxiety about an uncertain future that will lead to undiagnosed mental health issues in millions of people. “A lack of structure can really damage health because regularity of when you eat, how much your exercise, when you sleep is critical to manage NCDs, such as diabetes, obesity and depression,” said Dr Tandon.Many states in India have halted immunisation and reproductive health outreach services as community health workers help with Covid-19 surveillance and contact tracing. Missed immunisation may lead to a resurgence of potentially fatal vaccine-preventable diseases, such as childhood pneumonias, diphtheria, pertussis, hepatitis B and diarrhoea. This threatens to reverse the gains India has made by immunising children against vaccine-preventing illnesses to bring down infant mortality rate to 33 per 1,000 live births in 2017 from 34 the year before.States must begin drives to catch up on missed services. “Given travel restrictions and the very fear of contracting the disease, we have evidence showing that fewer women and children are visiting health facilities now... We see a gradual attention turning to safe motherhood, family planning services, emergency obstetric care, including safe abortion, but in India we are dealing with vast numbers, unlike any other country. Women of reproductive age here are close to 350 million. So the need is huge, but the Indian economy is the 5th in the world and if anyone can afford it, India is right at the top,” said Argentina Matavel Piccin, UNFPA Representative, India.The national programmes to eliminate malaria, and treat tuberculosis and HIV have also taken a hit and will need a push to ensure they don’t derail. “Overall case notification (in India) has significantly declined due to reduced testing and though the lab services are open, people cannot come due to the lockdown. Once the lockdown is relaxed or completely removed, we think there will be a surge in people seeking services,” said Jamie Tonsing, Regional Director of The South-East Asia Office of the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases ( The Union).Government officials are now realising the need to integrate health programmes, data systems and cross-departmental planning so that multiple agencies can work together. “What Covid-19 has taught us well is the need for coordination, not just inter-departmental, but also inter-ministerial. The central and state governments should not go back to bureaucratic normal after the worst of the Covid-19 pandemic is over but share resources to reach the common goal of keeping people healthy,” said a senior health ministry official, who did not want to be named. “We don’t want a situation like in Congo where after Ebola, more people die of TB, malaria and measles than from Ebola,” he said.“The biggest issue with public health delivery post-Covid is the recognition that universal health coverage is critical for any country to face a pandemic. Many countries are learning that you cannot build health care capacity during a crisis. It takes time and investment to build a good public health system. India has failed to invest in health for decades and this must change post-Covid19. Health spend must at least increase to 2.5% of GDP, at a minimum,” said Prof Madhukar Pai, Canada Research Chair in Translational Epidemiology & Global Health, and director, McGill Global Health Programs, McGill University, Montreal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/need-to-reboot-health-care-system-to-also-focus-on-non-covid-patients/story-a3caJQjm2BplVsvl3vkt8J.html
04-05-2020||India||Social distancing, curbs to mark flight and train travel||Social distancing requirements on long-distance travel modes such as trains and flights are likely to require operators to adopt drastic new measures, most of which will also impact the economics of their business. The civil aviation and the railways ministries are considering several restrictions such as crowd management, screening of possible infected persons and new rules that will make masks mandatory for all passengers as part of standard operating protocols (SOP) likely to be put in place when trains and flights can be resumed. One such SOP, released by the Airports Authority of India recently, suggests that flights are likely to resume at close to a third of their usual capacity, and airport terminals will open with only a few outlets for food and beverages.According to the SOP, seating arrangement shall be done in such a manner so as to maintain social distancing (1-1.5 m) among passengers using chairs at terminals. “Sufficient staff shall be deployed near washrooms, X-Ray machines, conveyor belts, etc, to guide passengers to maintain sufficient distance,” it said. Alternate check-in counters may also be introduced to avoid congestion.Strict social distancing norms are likely to also be introduced inside planes, though officials and experts are yet to determine how that will be possible. An official, who asked not to be named, said other ideas include spreading out flight timings to avoid crowding at terminals and asking people to arrive sooner than usual so that security and immigration processes can be completed while maintaining distancing.Civil aviation analysis agency CAPA said the current financial year will be hard on airlines. “Potential social distancing and inspection protocols when services resume will seriously impact the ability of airlines to even recover their variable costs. Some carriers may lose less money by remaining grounded,” it said. The Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) has proposed reporting time for passengers be increased up to 120 minutes. A ‘business continuity plan’ drafted by the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) has also proposed reporting time for passengers to the airport should be increased up to 120 minutes. Restrictions will also be imposed for travelling in trains. The ministry of railways is preparing detailed guidelines for sale of tickets; social distancing and other safety measures to be observed at train stations, train platforms and within the trains for facilitating movement of stranded migrants for now.There will be strict norms for passengers including arriving hours before the journey, downloading the Aarogya Setu app to display a health status and mandatory thermal screening, according to officials. Passengers will have to wear masks and apply hand sanitizers before and after boarding. Inside the trains, strict social distancing will be ensured, and the ministry is also mulling the idea of leaving the middle berth vacant and deploying only non-AC coaches, added the officials quoted above. The Centre is also planning to make ticketing for metro trains contactless and not allow passengers to use tokens.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/social-distancing-curbs-to-mark-flight-and-train-travel/story-GWr2v0HQXWdr3OErElUxoJ.html
04-05-2020||India||States to collect rail fares: Govt in guidelines||State authorities shall collect fares after distributing tickets among stranded migrants and students who are boarding special trains to return to their hometowns, and hand over the amount to the Indian Railways, the railways ministry said in fresh guidelines on Sunday.After allowing the running of the Shramik Special trains on Friday, the railways said it will charge sleeper class fares and an additional Rs 50 for one point-to-point journey, while it also added that states can coordinate and pay on passengers’ behalf.The move to charge fares for these trains ferrying migrants --- many of them have lost their jobs --- students and others stranded in different parts of the country due to the ongoing lockdown met with opposition.Rajasthan deputy chief minister and state Congress president Sachin Pilot said the central government should bear the expenses. “They have no earnings. In such a situation, they should not be charged fares…,” he said.Criticising the Centre, Communist Party of India (Marxist) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said: “It is very unfair that the entire responsibility has been shifted to the state governments....In Parliament, the government said it bore the entire cost of repatriating Indians stuck abroad. In the same manner the migrants should have been sent back.”National Conference leader Omar Abdullah tweeted similar views. “If you are stuck abroad during this COVID crisis this government will fly you back for free but if you are a migrant worker stranded in another state be prepared to cough up the cost of travel (with social distancing cost added)...,” he said.According to the fresh guidelines, the railways shall print train tickets to specified destinations on the basis of the number of passengers indicated by an originating state, and give the tickets to the local government authority. “The local state government authority shall hand over the tickets to the passengers cleared by them and collect the ticket fare and hand over the total amount to the railways,” the guidelines said.The railways also said these trains were being run only for those who have been identified and allowed to travel by the states sending and receiving them, and not for the general public. The railways reserves the right to discontinue the special train operations if safety protocols are flouted at any stage, the ministry said.“The originating state will inform the exact number of passengers travelling in a train, which should be 1200 (or at least 90%) considering the capacity…,” the guidelines said.Shramik Special trains are bound for a single destination without any stoppages. Usually, they have 24 coaches with each carrying a little over 50 in place of the total capacity of 72. These trains will run for distances of over 500 km.“We have informed that trains will not be stopping at any station in the middle, and states must make it clear to the passengers as there have been incidents where they thought they could get off…,” an official said on the condition of anonymity. The guidelines also said local authorities will give food packets and drinking water to passengers at the originating station. The railways will provide one meal on the train for a journey of over 12 hours.The railways ministry also asked states to encourage passengers to download the Aarogya Setu app for checking the health status of passengers.It will also be the responsibility of the governments sending people to bring such individuals to designated stations in sanitized buses, following social distancing norms. All passengers will have to mandatorily wear masks. Passengers will have to be screened by the sending states and only those found without symptoms of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) will be allowed to travel.States are also scrambling to arrange payments for the railways in order to ensure the running of these trains to bring their residents back home. Jharkhand is one of the few that has made an advance payment to the railways for deploying 31 special trains, according to officials aware of the developments.Five Shramik Special trains were run on Friday and 10 on Saturday. According to officials, railways is unlikely to run trains originating from red zones such as Delhi, Mumbai and Ahmedabad, at least for now.“There are no trains planned for now, but we are running (trains) in nearby places…like in Maharashtra trains, are being run at Bhiwandi and Vasai…Trains will only run to these places (red zones) when the demand from the state government comes,” said the official quoted above.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-to-collect-rail-fares-govt-in-guidelines/story-cluRhb7J58xqTZ0zqZizOK.html
04-05-2020||India||Send only stranded migrants: Centre tells states||As state governments scramble to book buses and trains to send migrant workers home, the Union home ministry on Sunday rebuked the state administrations and told them the transport hadn’t been meant for workers who intended to visit home, but for those in distress because they had been caught unawares by the lockdown.Home secretary Ajay Bhalla’s mild reprimand came after state governments rushed to the railways ministry to run special trains to send all migrant workers home. Bhalla underlined that the Centre had only made an exception for people who had been stranded because of the lockdown, enforced for three weeks from March 25 and twice extended since.“The facilitation envisaged in the aforesaid orders is meant for such distressed persons, but does not extend to those categories of persons, who are otherwise residing normally at places, other than the native places for purposes of work, etc., and who wish to visit their native places in normal course,” he wrote in a letter to state chief secretaries, a copy of which accessed by Hindustan Times.This is the first time that the home ministry has explicitly, in writing, stressed that the operative word in its order allowing the transport of migrant workers, tourists, students and others was “stranded”. On April 30, Hindustan Times reported the operative word fine print of the home ministry’s order:Cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba had also spelt out in a video conference with state chief secretaries last week that the relaxation shouldn’t result in a free-for-all and the states should only allow people who had been stranded due to the lockdown to travel from one state to another.The Centre decided to send the clarification in writing on Sunday after an assessment that the states, under pressure from the public and opposition parties, were getting into a race to send, or bring home, as many migrant workers as possible.“It is clarified that the MHA orders are meant to facilitate movement of such stranded persons, who had moved from their native places/workplaces, just before the lockdown period, but could not return to their native places/workplaces on account of restrictions placed on movement of persons and vehicles as part of lockdown measures,” Bhalla wrote in his letter..Central government officials said the state governments should have, in the first instance, offered the ride home to 1.4 million people living in relief camps run by the states or non-profit organisations.“They are the people who have been really in distress and are stranded in every sense of the word,” a government official said. He explained that the states, which were practically encouraging migrant workers to return home, should account for the fact that the state’s economy would take longer to revive in the absence of the migrant workforce that powers most industries.This was one reason why the Centre had been reluctant to run special trains to transport the workers. It relented when the chorus from the states became too loud.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/send-only-stranded-migrants-centre-tells-states/story-UtTQSjwogahL3fHTD2sr7M.html
04-05-2020||India||E-commerce likely to gain currency as retail sector gears up for changes||In some of the most sensitive Covid-19 outbreak areas – known as containment zones – the only method of purchasing essential supplies is through home deliveries, which reduces the risk of infections that can otherwise spread in settings like a crowded shop. While shops and direct-to-consumer businesses are slowly reopening in the other parts of the world, as well as in India, the crisis is likely to accelerate a trend that has gained strength in recent years: E-commerce.The changes in the retail sector can roughly be categorised into three phases – now, next, and beyond, according to the ‘Moving towards a resilient retail sector post Covid-19’ report by analysts at EY, who predict that old and rural consumers are likely to take to online purchases at a faster rate. “We are currently in the ‘now’ phase where most retailers are coping with a complete pause in business,” said Pinakiranjan Mishra, one of the authors of the report. “In the medium term, or the ‘next’ phase, where the government starts easing restrictions, retailers will need to focus on bouncing back from the current situation. In the long-term ‘beyond’ phase, they need to focus on transforming to succeed in a new business landscape. The challenges would be to cater to consumers via their preferred channels and to build business resiliency to operate smoothly during future crises,” he added.Co-author Farokh Balsara said the Covid-19 crisis could also be an opportunity. “The pandemic will reshape Indian retail, and the players ready to seize the opportunities of today would be leaders of the new retail industry that emerges post the crisis,” he said. The report said the pandemic should serve as a reminder to retailers to quickly build a flexible and agile business-and-operations model to take care of future disruptions. “This will mean a significant focus on converting to a digital enterprise. Thus, it is the time for retail players to get control of the current crisis and invest in the build-out of a more resilient organization,” said Mishra.The nature of business, too, will change because of compliance requirements to maintain social distancing and higher degree of hygiene.Global e-commerce giants such as Flipkart said they already have a stringent system in place. “At the Flipkart Group, the safety of our supply chain and delivery executives and the customers with whom they interact is of utmost priority,” said a company spokesperson.“For our supply chain and logistics network, we have organised more than 3,000 awareness sessions covering over 100,000 employees across all our facilities on how our employees and partners can minimise their exposure by following simple precautionary measures,” she said. Permanent features of retail businesses in India will include, temperature screening, fumigation, antibacterial soaps and hand sanitizers. Even for home deliveries, customers will be encouraged to use digital modes of payment and fully contactless deliveries will be encouraged.A government official working in an economic ministry said India’s policy focus would be more towards digital economy, whether it is online payment modes or online transactions. “The government is working with the industry to launch an indigenous e-commerce platform soon, which will link most of the 70 million ‘kirana’ stores with consumers,” this person said.The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) on April 24 announced that it would launch a national e-commerce marketplace soon with support of the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT). “Beside DPIIT and CAIT, the other promoters are Startup India, Invest India, All India Consumer Products Distributors Federation and Avana Capital,” the association of Indian retailers said in a statement. CAIT secretary general Praveen Khandelwal said, “The e-commerce marketplace will be of the traders, by the traders and for the traders and consumers of the country.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/e-commerce-likely-to-gain-currency-as-retail-sector-gears-up-for-changes/story-ahdCCYlzR8FwXMimNlAEZM.html
04-05-2020||India||Forces express gratitude to India’s Covid warriors||From fighter jets performing fly-pasts over Delhi’s Rajpath and Mumbai’s Marine Drive to helicopters showering petals over hospitals dedicated to treating Covid-19 patients and transport aircraft flying in formation over multiple cities; the armed forces on Sunday carried out exercises across the country in a concerted gesture of gratitude to people at the frontline of the battle against the virus.Army bands performed outside Covid-19 hospitals and sailors on-board India’s largest warship, INS Vikramaditya, formed a human chain on the aircraft carrier’s flight deck to pay tribute to the corona warriors. Several warships were also illuminated at anchorage at Mumbai, Porbandar, Karwar, Vizag, Chennai, Kochi and Port Blair.Senior officials said all the activities planned for the day, as announced by chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat, were carried out as scheduled.Acknowledging the role of the armed forces in honouring Covid-19 warriors, Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted, “Saluting those who are at the forefront, bravely fighting Covid-19. Great gesture by our armed forces.”Fighter jets and transport planes staged fly-pasts across the length and breadth of the country, from Srinagar to Thiruvananthapuram and Dibrugarh to Kutch.Defence minister Rajnath Singh tweeted: “I thank the Armed Forces for their special initiatives like fly pasts, showering flower petals and several other performances to express gratitude towards medical professionals, police and other frontline warriors. The entire nation stands united in these challenging times.”The fighter jets that featured in the fly-past over Delhi-NCR flew at a height of 500 to 1,000 metres and were visible to the residents of Delhi from their rooftops.The C-130J special operations aircraft also flew over Delhi-NCR in formation.Apart from Delhi-NCR, the IAF’s fighter jets carried out fly-pasts over Mumbai, Jaipur, Ahmedabad, Guwahati, Patna and Lucknow. Also, transport aircraft flew over 10 cities including Delhi, Srinagar, Chandigarh, Jaipur, Mumbai and Hyderabad.Air force helicopters showered petals on hospitals across 23 locations including Delhi, Leh, Chandigarh, Dehradun, Mumbai, Jaipur, Dispur, Itanagar, Trivandrum and Chennai. Navy and coastguard helicopters also showered petals over hospitals in Mumbai, Goa, Chennai and Port Blair.The air force also showered petals over the National Police Memorial in Delhi and wreaths were laid at the memorial on behalf of the three service chiefs to recognize the contribution of policemen who are at the forefront of the Covid-19 fight.Coastguard ships were also lit up across multiple locations on the country’s eastern and western sea boards as a mark of respect towards corona warriors.In Rajasthan, the Sapta Shakti Command organised multiple events to felicitate representatives of the Armed Forces. Defence spokesperson Col Sombit Ghosh said commemorative events with participation of military bands were organised at popular locations in towns to convey appreciation. “Helicopters of the Indian Air Force also joined in a fly-past showering petals over SMS Hospital Jaipur as a mark of gratitude. Fighter Jets Sukhoi-30 passed over Rajasthan Assembly and transport aircraft C-130 passed over Jalmahal Palace, Jaipur to express gratitude and solidarity,” Col Ghosh said.In Uttarakhand, Rishikesh, an Army chopper flew over the AIIMS building and showered flower petals in the morning. A team of the Army officials also visited the hospital and offered gifts to the staff as a thanking gesture. Dr Ravi Kant, director, AIIMS Rishikesh, said, “We all from AIIMS Rishikesh are really grateful to the defence forces for their gesture towards us. First, they flew past over our hospital and showered flower petals and later a team of Army officials visited us in the afternoon with gifts.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/forces-express-gratitude-to-india-s-covid-warriors/story-YxE211Mn0ySBzyqMKaPYAM.html

All of them were from 138th Battalion of BSF, Ambassa unit in Dhalai District. Out of eight districts of Tripura, two districts - Gomati and North are in orange zone. Ambassa in Dhalai District was not in an orange zone. Clock here for full coverage of Covid-19.The state’s nodal officer for Covid-19, Dr. Deep Kumar Debbarma said that these 12 troopers have been kept in isolation in the BSF camp.“We are planning to convert the camp into a care centre. Samples of nearly 300 BSF people from the camp were taken for testing. Their reports are expected to arrive on Monday,” he said.Chief Minister Biplab Kumar Deb took to Twitter to announce the latest infections.“Alert! 12 persons from 138th # BSF unit Ambassa found # COVID19 positive. Total # COVID19 positive cases of n Tripura stands at 16 (2 already discharged, so active cases: 14). Don’t panic, follow the Gov’t guidelines.

04-05-2020||India||Experts’ inputs to PM nod: What shapes govt guidelines||The government’s broad response to the coronavirus pandemic — symbolised in bureaucratic orders, guidelines, and clarifications with wide ranging impact — is shaped by a complex decision making process, which involves key union ministries and sectoral experts, inputs from state governments, intensive analysis of data, an assessment of daily reports, and finally a nod from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, three officials familiar with the process said.Ever since the national lockdown was announced on March 24, guidelines by the ministry of home affairs (MHA) have regulated lives of citizens, defined the scope of economic activities to be allowed, enabled — or prohibited —transport of persons and vehicles. In its latest order on Friday, while extending the lockdown for two weeks, the MHA order stipulated a set of relaxations in varying degrees in red, orange and green zones.But behind the formulation of these guidelines is an elaborate process. Officials involved in the process said that as a phase of lockdown draws to an end, or a crisis — such as the one regarding stranded migrant workers — erupts, MHA, the health ministry and Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) officials swing into action.There is also a parallel process that takes place, with cabinet secretary Rajeev Gauba convening a meeting with state governments; consultations and inputs here too shape guidelines. “The first step of making guidelines usually starts with a meeting between the cabinet secretary and the states where many key secretaries are also present,” said an official involved in the process. The government also listens to the perspectives of other stakeholders, particularly those involved in the economy and carefully weighs the trade-offs. The latest guideline on extending the federal lockdown till May 17 came after a series of formal and informal meetings last week. In one of the video conferences, ICMR made presentations with charts and projections on the rate of spread of the disease, how the virus is likely to progress, the situation in Covid hotspots and how green and orange zones are faring.The union health ministry then provided its inputs from the public health perspective. Based on inputs from cabinet secretariat and other sources, the union home ministry prepared a draft guideline for further discussion. Only after the inter-ministerial consultations are over, the issue is taken up by the National Disaster Management Authority and the Prime Minister’s Office.A senior official said that every aspect of the guideline is discussed threadbare at different levels. “In the latest circular, the government carefully used the phrase ‘lockdown measures to be continued to be implemented in all parts of the country’. Even as the guideline issued on May 1 provided major concessions, the NDMA was careful not to convey any impression to the public that it is business as usual,” said one official.Another official added that the government is extremely cautious after thousands of people came out on the streets to celebrate on March 22 even as the PM appealed to the nation to voluntarily stay indoors from 7am till 9pm. This, he underlined, had made the government conscious that every little detail must be spelt out to prevent any confusion. Between the NDMA, chaired by the PM, and the home ministry, there are at times some discussions on finer aspects of the guideline. And finally, only after the PM gives his approval, the guidelines are issued.A senior official said that the Prime Minister, who is spearheading the country’s battle against Corona, depends a lot of sectoral experts and inputs from the states before taking a final call on issues related to the Covid||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/experts-inputs-to-pm-nod-what-shapes-govt-guidelines/story-CXCqViOrCPnWhfkPXStUwK.html
04-05-2020||India||With some relaxations, states draw up plan for lockdown 3.0||India prepared on Sunday for the third phase of the ongoing lockdown with states and Union Territories drafting their own rules, mostly in line with federal guidelines that have given area-specific relaxations in a graded approach to bring back normalcy in the backdrop of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.There were some that stood out. Among them was Jharkhand, which announced that there will be no relaxations spelt out by the central government for the three zones in the country --- red, orange and green --- for two weeks beginning Monday.“Migrant workers, students and others are returning home from other states. As a precautionary measure, lockdown would continue in Jharkhand for next two weeks. The new directions of the Centre regarding relaxations would not be implemented in for now,” chief minister Hemant Soren said in a Twitter post.Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageIn the eastern state, capital Ranchi is in red zone (areas with most Covid-19 cases); 11 districts are in orange zone (places with fewer cases) while the rest of the 12 are in green zone (places with no cases).The northeastern state of Mizoram promulgated an ordinance making the punishment for violations of lockdown measures more stringent, a day after Rajasthan passed a similar ordinance.The Assam government announced a complete ban on the movement of non-essential travel between 6pm and 6am for the next two weeks, which covers the extended lockdown period. The central guideline has banned such travels from 7 pm and 7 am.“Directives have been issued to police to take stringent action against curfew violators. Hence, we request everyone to ensure that the restrictions are complied with,” health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said. “All relaxations are only for districts in green zones...” Of Assam’s 33 districts, 30 are green and three orange zones. Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra, two big states, toed the Centre’s line.The Maharashtra government allowed the functioning of standalone liquor shops across the state, barring containment zones (which are areas inside red/orange zones with stricter perimeter control).According to a government notification, standalone shops selling non-essential items, too, will be allowed in red zones, which include Mumbai and Pune. Construction activities in all red zone districts will be allowed, provided workers are available on site.In UP, standalone liquor shops can operate from 10 am to 7 pm with social distancing in red zones. The state also allowed all standalone shops and shops in residential complexes.In line with the central directive, the state allowed private four-wheelers with a maximum of two persons besides the driver for all activities permitted by the government in red zones. Private offices can operate with up to 33% of staff strength in such areas.Lucknow, the capital of India’s most populous state, Agra and Gautam Budh Nagar (which houses Noida), among other districts in UP, are red zones.Chhattisgarh, too, allowed liquor shops and was planning to start its home delivery, according to a minister. Liquor shops will be open from 8am to 7pm. “To maintain social distancing, we have decided to provide home delivery to some big colonies and settlements,” Chhattisgarh excise minister Kawasi Lakhma said. “How liquor will be delivered online will be announced on Monday. We are still working on it.” Karnataka, too, permitted the sale of liquor in standalone stores. So did Madhya Pradesh. But a minister in Uttarakhand said liquor shops may not be open in red zones. And Kerala, where per capita consumption is second highest after Punjab, was yet to resume selling liquor.Karnataka said Bengaluru urban and its four neighbouring districts (Bengaluru Rural, Ramanagara, Chikkaballapur and Kolar) would be treated as a single unit for inter-district movement of individuals and vehicles between 7am to 7pm for permitted activities with the production of letter from the company they are working in and the official identity card. Hence, no other inter-district passes will be required to move across these districts, the order said.The Goa government agreed to restart public transport, including buses, taxis and auto rickshaws but only with 50% of seating capacity, while restricting their timing from 7am-7pm.Chief minister Pramod Sawant announced said several services and economic activities will resume in line with the central guidelines since Goa is a green zone. He, however, stressed that all non-essential shops should be closed by 6pm so that people can be home by 7pm.“Only essential workers such as medical workers and other essential services like shops selling milk will be allowed to be open after 7pm,” Sawant said.Restaurants, street eateries, beach shacks and drinking in public places will remain prohibited as these activities banned across the nation.In Rajasthan, the government prohibited the sale of pan and tobacco products, though the central guidelines have allowed the opening of shops selling tobacco products with strict social-distancing norms.The Centre first imposed a 21-day lockdown on March 25, and then extended it for 19 days till May 3. On Friday, the government announced another two-week extension, but this time with zone-specific curbs and relaxations though there are some activities banned throught the country.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-some-relaxations-states-draw-up-plan-for-lockdown-3-0/story-S8XApMshduTLVv8AwrfYuJ.html
04-05-2020||India||Mumbai Police files FIR against Arnab Goswami, accuses him of spreading hatred||The Mumbai police registered an FIR against Arnab Goswami, editor and owner of Republic TV channel on Saturday following a complaint that he tried to create hatred against Muslims last month.The case was registered at Pydhonie police station and investigation has been initiated, police said.Irfan Abubakar Shaikh, secretary of Raza Educational Welfare Society and a resident of Null Bazar in South Mumbai in his complaint to the police alleged that both the channel and Goswami were trying to create hatred against the Muslim community and targeted a mosque in Bandra that had no link to the protest by migrants on April 14.  Also Watch: Arnab Goswami, wife attacked in Mumbai; 2 arrestedShaikh said that on April 29, the Hindi channel Republic Bharat had used footage of the Bandra protest by migrants who had gathered near Bandra railway station. Arnab Goswami was anchoring the show.“There was no link or issue related to the mosque near the Bandra station. The only issue was that the migrants had gathered in the open space near the mosque. But Arnab purposely highlighted the mosque to create communal disturbance in the city,” said Shaikh in his compliant to the police. Shaikh highlighted alleged comments by Goswami like ‘Ab se thodi der pehle Mumbai ke Bandra me Jama Masjid Hai.’ Aur Is Jama Masjid Ke Pass Achanak Hazaro logo Ki Bheed Jama Hogae’. (Thousands of people gathered outside Jama Masjid in Bandra) ‘Mumbai ke Bandra me masjid Ke pass kisne bheed jutae.

(Why is it that crowds gather near every mosque during lockdown), which he claimed fuelled hatred against Muslims.“There were many such questions and debate on the channel intended to blame the Muslim community for the spreading of Covid-19 disease. Goswami had made many such hate filled comments against the community, targeting it,” the complainant said.Shaikh said Goswami linked the Bandra Mosque to the migrants’ protest without any reason and gave a communal colour to the protest which had no link or involvement if any particular community.The Pydhonie police registered a case under various sections of the Indian penal code.“We have registered a case against Arnab Goswami and the owner of Republic TV for the hatred. Further investigation is going on. As part of evidence after taking the statement we have collected the footage of the shows with the clips in a pen drive as evidence,” said a police officer from Pydhonie police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai-police-file-fir-against-arnab-goswami-accuses-him-of-spreading-hatred/story-8tfFHRTG7xImSCrgpS1PWI.html

In the face of this pandemic, Indians across class, caste, region and religion have been supporting each other. With a huge chunk of population below poverty line, the poor have been hit the hardest. Many NGOs and self-help groups have come forward in supplying meals to the needy people.Sattu, the desi nutrition powerhouse is being served by NGOs to hundreds of needy people in Meerut and Mirzapur in Uttar Pradesh. Sumithra Prasad, founder, Dorai foundation, that is distributing sattu in these cities, says, “Along with dry ration, we started giving bananas and melons to keep people energised.” She adds, “Then we added shakkar paras prepared by single mothers who are unemployed at this moment. Soon, we realised that sattu, too, can be a great addition.”A staple diet of Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh, sattu is now a global superfood. Prasad says, “We prepare sattu in the traditional way, which involves using an iron vessel in which horse gram is roasted and mixed with jaggery. Then this dry mixture is sieved and grounded into a fine flour. Then we distribute to people residing in the interiors of Uttar Pradesh with no means of livelihood at this moment. ”The power of social solidarity in a time of mandated physical distancing is immense. “We Indians are socially responsible citizens. All the volunteers have tirelessly worked for the production and distribution of sattu,” she says. Prem Shankar Yadav, speech therapist and a volunteer, says, “Sattu is rich in iron, manganese, and magnesium, and low on sodium. It provides instant energy and also works as a cooling agent in summer.” He adds, “Sattu can be had anywhere, anytime. For migrants, this is the most wholesome dish which is easy to prepare and easy on the stomach.”Units have been set up in Mirzapur and Meerut, where a differently-abled volunteer, Imran Maliik helps with the production. He says, “This is the most paushtik (healthy) drink one can get. Specially during corona, it is imperative to boost immunity and this is what this drink aids.” “Saatu flushes out toxins and it is considered to be a full meal. It can be had as a shake with a bit of salt, raw onion, cumin, green chili and lemon. It’s a great idea to serve sattu to keep people fit,!”, says chef Nishant Choubey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sattu-the-saviour-in-uttar-pradesh-ngos-are-beating-hunger-with-the-desi-nutrition-powerhouse/story-W96Z6uKWMH232Lo4bZhkEL.html

Many migrant labourers who weren’t able to make it back to their villages are now living in shelter homes provided by the government.While the government has made arrangements for their ration and daily needs, they are short of clothes and personal hygiene necessities. “At the shelters in Soniya Vihar, where we are deployed, we noticed that many labourers were wearing the same clothes for days, as they had no choice. So we decided to put together some lightly used and freshly washed clothes for them,”says 20-year-old NCC cadet Aartika Bhayana.Bhayana, with three more team members distributed clothes in all sizes to these migrant workers residing at shelter home. “We collected clothes from residents, our relatives and family members. We washed them, ironed them and gave it to more than 112 labourers. They were not expecting this and it brought an instant smile on their faces. They clapped for the entire team that this made this possible,” says Bhayana, who was supported by Ridhima Khanna, Preeti Singh and Kanchan Singh. The NCC cadets were assigned the task to maintain social distancing at the shelters, provide labourers with ration and other necessities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-times-of-covid-19-a-gift-of-hygiene-for-migrant-labourers/story-4Dbp3WtfsYukGlp74BxD9K.html

Inspector Neha Chauhan, says, “We saw a Facebook post by his children tagging us and asking if we could do something for his birthday. So with the help constables Neha, Parvin, Aarti and driver Mahavir, we bought a cake and went to celebrate his birthday.”As soon as these police personnel spotted the old gentleman in his house, Puri started to retreat back in his house, fearing that they would reprimand him on not following the guidelines of the lockdown. He tells us on phone, the video not only went viral but went into overdrive. “Though politically incorrect, but it spread like coronavirus,” says Puri.As the global pandemic has brought a host of new experiences, including working from home, home-schooling and online socialising, it has also, unsurprisingly, increased the loneliness of all people. Puri says, “Like everyone else, even I hadn’t stepped out of my house at all due to the lockdown. But seeing so many people after a month with a cake for my birthday made me emotional and tears of happiness rolled out of my eyes.” He jokingly adds, “I have just turned 69 years young and anyone is bound to become emotional at such a celebration.”For loneliness, he says all of us have to bear it as we have no other choice. He says, “It’s not just senior citizens, but everyone is battling the demon of isolation. We all  are social beings and thrive on interactions and meeting new people.” Senior citizen gets birthday surprise from Haryana Police, video goes viral via @htTweets https://t.co/v7AeGebfpLPuri, owner of Atma Ram and Sons publishing house, says, “All my family including my granddad has been in publishing. At this time, I am missing my daily routine. More than anything, I miss travelling 11km to my store at Punjab University. Never thought I would say this but I miss the traffic and of course seeing new faces and meeting old acquaintances.”He has two sons, one settled in Australia and the other in Delhi who had requested Panchkula Police to surprise his father. He says, “I thank ACP Nupur Bisht, who planned the surprise.” Question him on whether he would like to celebrate his birthday like this every year, with the cops, and he laughs and says, “Are you kidding me?”As an afterthought he says, “Well, of course! I have celebrated my birthday in different continents but this was very different and I will cherish it for many years.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/celebrations-can-t-be-locked-down-cops-planned-a-lovely-surprise-for-this-birthday-boy/story-62DPDzQH992MCWX8yEeAEJ.html
04-05-2020||India||Hating people won’t benefit anyone at this point: Skipping Sikh Rajinder Singh||The coronavirus hit us by surprise, and consumed us within months. With COVID-19 dominating the news cycle, words like quarantine and self-isolation are being used with an uneasy casualness and lethargy is setting in. But for some people, the lockdown can’t act as a detterent when it comes to their fitness routine. A keen runner, 73-year-old Rajinder Singh was initially at a loss as to how he was going to keep fit when Britain went under a lockdown. Labelled as ‘the skipping Sikh’, he says, “Health is wealth. And my good health is a result of god’s blessings. I do five minute skipping honestly everyday.” He shared a video of himself skipping rope in the backyard of his home and it went viral. Singh’s love of skipping was sparked by his father many years ago and he now wants to be a role model to others in his community. Born in Devidaspura, a village in Punjab, he says, “I moved to London in 1972 from Punjab and my love for running was instilled in me by my father, along with other qualities like helping people in need even if it meant running across villages.”For his part, Rajinder, has always loved exercising and says, “ Since I was young, I used to participate in all sports at my village. My father encouraged me to run and play all forms of sports to maintain my health.” Skipping brings a lot of joy to Singh and he wishes to share this happiness with others. He says, “It just requires stamina and you have to just grab a rope.”The pandemic hasn’t prevented Singh to stay away from his exercise schedule for even one day. “With the available resources, I am sticking to my fitness regime. I have been skipping and running around my house. I have been spending time with my family and also working in my kitchen garden.”He wants to inspire people of his age to stay fit and he’s urged others to post similar videos. “ As I started posting videos online, people blessed me from all over the world and encouraged me to post more videos. I motivate others to do the same.”Keeping in mind all the guidelines laid by the government, the 73-year old says, “ I am a law abiding citizen and I am happy to have been following all rules laid by the government.” A god-believer, he believes in respecting people of all races, religions and ethnicities. Singh says, “We are all together in this fight, hating people at this time won’t benefit anyone at this point.”He further adds, “We need to work compassionately to get the world rid of this virus. The pandemic has made us realise that we are all one, one of the foremost Indian values taught to kids back in the country.”With the help of his daughter, Min Kaur, he has also set up a fundraising initiative that hopes to raise money for the British National Health Service (NHS). “It is brilliant, no one can compare with the NHS. I am very thankful to them as they are working round-the clock to save lives and we must try our best to help them,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hating-people-won-t-benefit-anyone-at-this-point-skipping-sikh-rajinder-singh/story-5fdBAXDXMOuZ6RNW7M4k8I.html

An artist in Chennai came up with the idea of corona shaped helmets a few weeks ago. Police officers in Chennai wore the helmets to deter people from stepping out of their homes.Now, he has modified an autorickshaw to look like coronavirus with spikes in its body to spread awareness about the infection. B. Gowtham, the creative artist, says, “When I started to work on the corona helmet and then this auto, the idea was to make the city administrations’s and police’s work easier with attention grabbing art.” He adds, “The auto is the identity of the city so it was my obvious choice as it would send out the message loud and clear.” The Corona auto is being used to spread awareness among the people of Chennai to wear a mask while being out of their houses. The Chennai based artist says, “Even if my initiative can save one life from the deadly virus. I would be very happy.”The auto is made of 165 discarded plastic bottles. It took six days with the help of six people to make this quirky piece of art. “While making it, we had to be very careful as it had to look aesthetically beautiful as well as technically sound,” says Gowtham.To make work easy for the administration, the auto is fitted with an audio system to transmit awareness messages about wearing the mask. The 27-year-old artist says, “Wearing masks is a necessary precaution and if people of Chennai don’t abide by the rules, they will be heavily fined. This auto is here to make people aware of the crisis we are facing and how a simple measure such as wearing masks will go a long way in helping save lives.”The COVID-19 pandemic is a stark reminder of our dysfunctional relationship with nature. Gowtham adds, “In many ways, corona virus has made us aware that as a human race, we are so tiny and we have always been ruthless to our planet and never really considered it as our home.”Gowtham feels that if we follow all rules of the nature, do not spit or litter and add less carbon footprint, we will be able to create peace and harmony and co-exist beautifully with nature.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/quirky-ideas-make-an-impact-after-corona-helmets-artist-comes-up-with-corona-auto/story-eS8TMaDk867JphAqEfoZOK.html
04-05-2020||India||A roti bank for ‘laddoos’: Indore’s unique endeavour for street dogs||A countrywide lockdown announced by the government to fight COVID-19 left the stray canines in distress. With resources less for even humans, it is a very critical time for these stray dogs as they are exposed to severe shortage of food.In a unique endeavour, Indore Municipal Corporation has set up a roti bank for stray dogs that are starving. The motivating force behind it, Vandana Jain, who runs a campaign, Dogitization in Indore, Madhya Pradesh, says, “The municipal corporation has always helped us. With their help, we created a roti bank, where we make 5,000 rotis and then we distribute it through NGOs.”Jain started Dogitization to create awareness amongst citizens of Indore to be kind and compassionate towards the street dogs. She also encouraged everyone to win the trust of the dogs and eventually send off each dog of the city to dog sterilization clinics.Vandana and her group lovingly address each stray dog as ‘laddoo’. She says, “It’s sad that humans divided themselves in upper and lower castes, and they also created levels in animals. Godmen appeal to us to worship cows, give them roti and chaara. But no one talks that about dogs. I feel till the time ‘kutta’ word is used, people will never respect this life.”So, in order to make people fall in love with the sweetest and most faithful living creature on earth, she promotes them as ‘laddoo’ instead of kutta (dog). “Everyone should try it. Speak to a dog on the street and call him laddoo and offer him food and you will see how the dog starts wagging its tail, it will make an instant bond with you,” she says.In these trying times, Jain is thankful for the support she is getting from the administration. She says, “I convinced the additional SP, Maneesha Pathak Soni to allow one toast manufacturer to also make toasts for these street dogs and she granted us the permission.”Dogitization could manage to order 1,200 kg toasts in 16 hours for hungry dogs. She says, “That goes on to show how kind this city is. Without the city’s support, we could not have done this”. We wish all the happy laddoos of Indore a healthy, happy life!||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-roti-bank-for-laddoos-indore-s-unique-endeavour-for-street-dogs/story-theQl80ytmZuG41ObKGgoK.html
04-05-2020||Today's||Time for industry, society to win the trust of migrant labour | Opinion||The Covid-19 pandemic, in certain ways, is altering the world view of people, societies and even countries. India is no exception. The extended lockdown has focused attention on certain ‘invisibles’ of Indian society and economy viz. the plight of migrant labour whether working in the agriculture fields of Punjab and Haryana, the multi-billion dollar gem & jewellery industry of Surat, textile mills and chemical industries in Gujarat and Maharashtra or the ubiquitous informal sector of ‘service sector’ in the metros – as labour in grain and farm mandis, plying rickshaws and push carts, loading and unloading trucks etc.First, we had the spectacle of lakhs of men with their families hitting the road on foot when the lockdown was announced. This was followed by hasty arrangements made by state governments to arrange for their boarding and lodging in school buildings, shelter homes etc. Still with no work, no money, the initial enthusiasm of donors and state agencies to feed them twice daily waning, the migrant workers are on their way back to their villages in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal among others. Thankfully, state governments have now come forward and the railways have agreed to run ‘Shramik Specials’ to ferry them back to their states and villages even while maintaining the prescribed ‘physical distance’ and hygiene during the journey. It is interesting to note media reports that chief ministers of Karnataka, Telangana and Haryana have appealed to the migrant labourers not to go back to their villages especially when ‘lockdown’ is being slowly eased and economic activity is set to resume. There were also reports in the media that if labour did not return, some labour-intensive industries would be forced to shift operations closer to places where these labourers stay provided the state government concerned provides suitable support. Of course, export oriented units could not relocate as distance from the ports would add to their costs and make their products non-competitive in the world market.So what do these seemingly unconnected responses to the issue of migrant labour indicate? First, the fact that these ‘invisible’ migrant labour are necessary to keep the wheels of our cities and industry moving. Not only manufacturing activity but also the ‘service’ sector could be severely impacted if the workforce doesn’t return. Sectors affected could range from cleaning of drains before the monsoons, sewerage and sanitation work in the towns, services ranging from those provided by semi-skilled to skilled labour i.e. washermen and ubiquitous ‘press men’ outside or inside all colonies and gated communities, household helps, construction workers, electricians, plumbers, painters, vegetable and fruit vendors, rag pickers etc. Life without them suddenly begins to look more difficult for the average city dweller.But what have the employers, local bodies or state governments done or given to them to ensure that they stay back? Precious little. These migrant labourers work in the paddy fields undertaking back breaking transplantation of paddy from nurseries to the field at an estimated cost of Rs 2,500 per acre while local workers charge Rs 4,500 per acre. But arrangements for their boarding and lodging are pretty rudimentary, if at all provided by the farmers. In cities where they stay, what they eat, how they commute is not the concern of the employer. The employer demands punctuality, regularity, cleanliness before these people can enter their houses or establishments. The wages paid to them would also be what these labourers are able to negotiate with their employer which is inversely proportional to their desperation for a job.Now, all that is in the past. What do we do now? How can cities win their trust and get them back? In my view, certain things need to be done urgently. First, identify the areas where these labourers stay, their workplace and locate suitable places where decent accommodation can be built for them. These could be multi-storeyed flats of various dimensions – one-room units with an attached kitchen and bathroom to two-room units with all basic amenities that could be rented out to them at Rs. 500 to Rs 1,000 per month for one-room unit to Rs 1,500 to Rs 2,500 per month for two-room units with all necessary infrastructure like education, health facility, fair price shops etc. The average distance of these locations from their workplace should not be more than 2 to 3 kms .It should be the responsibility of the state or local body to provide land for this purpose and the cost of housing units should be shared by the state government, local body, trader and industry associations. Only when society, employers, local bodies and state governments show through concrete action that they care, are ready to look after their well being and recognise their role as a stakeholder in development and prosperity of city and state, that this issue will be truly resolved and vibrancy and cohesiveness of society guaranteed. Future lies in acting as ‘we’ rather than ‘me’.(VS Pandey is a former IAS officer.

04-05-2020||Editorials||The challenge of lockdown 3.0 | HT editorial||The first day of lockdown 3.0 has shown the challenges involved in the graded opening up of the country. On Friday, the Union government came up with a complex order — which categorised the country into red, green and orange zones; prohibited a set of activities nationally; and allowed other activities, in varying degrees, in the different zones. This made sense. India needed a calibrated loosening up to ensure that there wasn’t an immediate surge in cases.But for this approach to succeed, there were two prerequisites. The first was proper bureaucratic implementation — and this was always going to be difficult because of the inability of local police officials or district authorities to distinguish between what was permitted and prohibited, and who to allow and who to stop. But the second, more important prerequisite was citizens exercising a high degree of responsibility.On day 1, this was missing. The most egregious reflection of this was in liquor shops. People lined up in hundreds, often without masks, jostling with each other, to buy cases of alcohol. The police authorities had to, in some cases, resort to lathi-charge or close shops. Liquor is an important source of revenue for state governments. Given the dire straits of public finances, as well as popular demand, opening stores made sense. But if citizens behave with such irresponsibility, then don’t rule out a revision of rules in the future. In times of the pandemic, it is not just about drinking responsibly — but also purchasing it responsibly. It is about maintaining social distancing and knowing that the right to step out comes with responsibilities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-challenge-of-lockdown-3-0-ht-editorial/story-cyOAKPtW4J1aAQ3ChasuQJ.html
04-05-2020||Editorials||Handwara: India must act strongly | HT editorial||Even the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) fails before Pakistan’s obsession with inflicting terror against India. The Handwara encounter, in which five Indian soldiers and a policeman were killed fighting a militant cell, is a reminder that through the pandemic, it has been business-as-usual along the Line of Control and in Kashmir. The past few months have seen a steady exchange of fire between Indian and Pakistani forces along the border, a parallel infiltration of militants, and concomitant terrorist activity in Kashmir. Rawalpindi’s recent rebranding of the existing militant groups in Kashmir as “The Resistance Front” does nothing to disguise the fact what is happening continues to be State-sponsored terrorism with Rawalpindi’s favourite Lashkar-e-Taiba at the forefront of the violence. Pakistan has been ratcheting up violence in and along Kashmir since the abrogation of Article 370. This is despite failing to persuade the international community to force India to reverse its decision, and the sanctions threat of the United Nations Financial Action Task Force. It is evident to everyone that India is not going to change what was passed in Parliament without opposition, and is now engraved in the Constitution. Pakistan knows this too, but what it is seeking to do is make India pay a price for effectively cutting Islamabad out of the future of the Valley. Pakistan should know that incidents like Handwara, however tragic, will do nothing to bend India’s will. Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi laid out a new path for Indo-Pakistani relations, one that focused on trade and investment, tackling common development challenges and building personal bridges. It required, however, Pakistan to accept that the use of coercion to force territorial changes is no longer viable. The Covid-19 pandemic provided a perfect opportunity for Islamabad to at least explore this new path, using the excuse of a common viral enemy to put aside a legacy of animosity. Instead, PM Imran Khan chose to treat the pandemic as a non-event and the military, which still determines Kashmir policy, rejected the opportunity through violence on the ground. Pakistan must accept the new reality. But a nation born in bloodshed and sustained by violence will not surrender its delusions easily and peacefully. Which is why India should take into account these designs, anticipate challenges, and respond accordingly. Security forces will have to be at the forefront of this battle. The prize at the end will make it all worthwhile: The conclusion of the Kashmir conflict, a more united India and forcing Pakistan to, hopefully, give up terror as an instrument of State policy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/handwara-india-must-act-strongly-ht-editorial/story-zK1rToXYOpeHYSX214j5oI.html
