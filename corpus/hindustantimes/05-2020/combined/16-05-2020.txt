What should be the first set of priorities to focus on? How should schools proceed? Looking through the fog of uncertainty and disruption brought on by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) crisis, I see opportunity. A chance to do things in a new way. When schools open this year, it will be the most anticipated school opening of all time. Children, parents and teachers are all waiting for that moment. Schools were among the first institutions to shut in India. They shut even before the lockdown. The reopening of schools, therefore, will be a clear announcement that normal routines can restart and the daily schedules of life can resume. Schools can restart in several different ways. It can be “business-as-usual”. Worse, the system can go into an “accelerated” mode, trying to cram in all the things that did not happen since March. But what is needed is a time for welcome and a period for settling down. This is not just any “back-to-school” moment. This school opening should be treated as the start of a brand, new chapter. Children need to reconnect with friends. Schools and students need to get reacquainted. Teachers need time to understand the impact of the long unplanned school closure on where children currently are — socially, emotionally, and academically. Helping them to settle in and “catch up” will go a long way towards rebuilding foundations and strengthening basic skills. While urban educated families have been able to support their children’s learning activities through the lockdown period, this has been difficult for many households in slum communities and vast parts of rural India. For primary school children, especially in government schools or in low-cost private schools, school closures may have weakened their ability to read or to do basic arithmetic. For older children, boosting reading and comprehension skills, sharpening communication, and the capability to apply language and math skills to actual texts and problems may be needed. In both cases, putting aside the usual age-grade curriculum and focussing on relevant foundational skills, for a few hours in each school day for the first few months, will be an excellent way to start the school year for 2020. The severe economic blow to many families is already visible and is likely to worsen. In such times of hardship, the already vulnerable and weak become even more disadvantaged. We must closely watch and reach out to children who are “at-risk”. Ensuring continuous and steady attendance in school is a must for a real return to normalcy. Girls in upper primary grades may be especially prone to being pulled out. As adult women seek work in the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act or hunt for other local livelihood options, the pressure on teenage girls to help with household chores is likely to intensify. Years of work to ensure universal elementary education cannot be undone by the Covid-19 crisis. Specifically, I worry about girls who have reached class 7 and 8 but whose academic standing is not strong. Rather than demanding stronger and longer remedies in education, poor parents may be tempted to withdraw such girls from school. We certainly need “beti padhao”, but more than that we need “beti padhey” and “padhtey rahe”. Parents have played a very central role in the lockdown period. Schools must recognize their contribution and support. While the national media has been preoccupied in discussing the pros and cons of on-line education, in the last six weeks, we, in Pratham, have embarked on an interesting adventure. In about 11,000 rural and urban communities across India, we have been sending phone messages to parents with a few activities that children can do that day. We started with WhatsApp messages, but it became clear very quickly that many children do not have access to smartphones. Hence, an entirely new wave of SMS messages was quickly developed and are being delivered daily. Thanks to ongoing relationships in these communities, we are also able to call and talk to parents and children at least once a week. Families send back videos and photos of their children’s handiwork; boys and girls phone us frequently to share their experiences. This two-way communication provides excellent feedback for understanding what children and parents can do together even with simple, sparse instructions. We have learned that parents participate in activities that they can engage with, and that continuous discussion and follow up results in energetic and enthusiastic involvement, even from parents who are not highly educated themselves. Parents play a critical role in their children’s lives; we have seen how the lockdown has led to their active support in children’s learning. Now it will be important to keep parental participation high even after schools open.The year 2020 is not a year for ambitious learning targets; nor is it a year for moving rapidly through what is already recognized as an overambitious curriculum. The new 2020 school year should be spent in reconnecting, settling down, “catching” up, rebuilding foundations and in enjoying school. We must do this to ensure that our children emerge strong and ready for tackling the 2021-22 school year.

16-05-2020||Mumbai||In Mumbai wetland, a spectacle in pink||First, thousands of lesser flamingos, likely from Gujarat, coloured the Talawe wetlands near NRI Complex in Navi Mumbai pink during the lockdown, their numbers bolstered by the sheer lack of human activity.Now, the water in part of the wetland itself has turned pink, probably due to an explosive blooming of red algae that thrives in saline water, especially as the summer picks up and the wetland loses water. The deep pink water, located towards the south-eastern end of the wetland, was spotted by HT photojournalist Pratik Chorge on Thursday. The pink water was not there till late last week. The bloom has been identified as rare and first-of-its-kind occurence for Mumbai Metropolitan Region by Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) that plans to take samples of the water for study. However, a local resident, Seema Tania from NRI Complex, Seawoods, said she spotted the pink wash across a much larger area at the same creek in 2016.“Almost 500-600m patch of the creek turned bright pink and we thought chemicals had been dumped in the creek,” she said.While researchers were unsure of what may have caused it, BNHS and independent microbiologists presume that the colour is from microscopic algae. “Owing to high salinity in the area, it looks like an algal bloom. Our researchers have never witnessed something like this along Mumbai’s creeks,” said Deepak Apte, director, BNHS. “Around the world, such a phenomena has been observed regularly with red algae but it has to be investigated how it has appeared along the Mumbai creek.” Flamingos are known to feed on this algae, crustaceans, shrimp, and aquatic plants, which gives them the pink colour, said Apte. The birds also feed on zooplankton which feeds on the algae. Dr P Sathiyaselvam, assistant director (wetland conservation), BNHS said, “This is clearly an algal bloom. We have observed the same at the northern portion of Chilika Lake (in Odisha) during early winter months over the years, and also towards the northern end of wetlands in Thoothukudi in Tamil Nadu. This is temporary and the water clears out within 48 to 72 hours for small patches.”Another BNHS official said certain microscopic algae and bacteria produce carotenoids, specifically beta-Carotene (a provitamin giving a red-orange pigment that’s found in high numbers within the algae), which is consumed by flamingos, giving them the bright pinkish-red feathers as they mature from juveniles to adults. “If this is a natural phenomenon, vigorous growth of algae or bacteria having this beta-Carotene gives this type of characteristic colouration to the water. It is also related to increased evaporation, salinity, and the current hot and humid weather conditions,” said Rahul Khot, assistant director (in-charge of the flamingo monitoring program). “We do not know the impact on birds due to this change in water colour.”A microbiologist said there are a group of bacteria called halobacteria that grows in extremely high saline environment, which give a bright pink or reddish appearance. “There is scientific literature that states that this carotenoid red pigment is secreted by halobacteria. This could be mostly coming from the algae present in the creek,” said Dr Rohini Kelkar, director of laboratories and head of microbiology, Tata Memorial Hospital. “Bacteria produce a whole range of pigments and reactions...The caretonoid pigment probably attract the birds that are sensing the nutrient value in the water. However, these are still assumptions, and can only be verified through a detailed sampling study.”Ornithologist, naturalist and writes Sunjoy Monga said a similar discolouration of water with a pink hue was witnessed at a flamingo habitat in Porbandar in May, 2007. “This happened at the edges of the creek cramped with flamingos with high salinity displaying a pinkish maroon wash to it. While we took photographs, we had no idea what caused this.” Tania explained that in 2016 when residents had shared images with Spanish researchers, they confirmed similar events at flamingo habitats in Spain. “We were told the algae and bacteria result in such changes when temperatures increase. However, such incidents were not observed in Navi Mumbai over the past two years,” she said. “From the available details of the presence of this phenomenon in Mumbai, there is no other possible explanation other than the presence of red algae at this flamingo feeding ground,” said Dr P Pramod, principal scientist, Sálim Ali Centre for Ornithology and Natural History.A similar example of what has been observed in Navi Mumbai was recently witnessed across a massive stretch at the Edgars Creek in Melbourne, Australia, that started on May 10 and intensified subsequently. The source of the pink water is being investigated, the Epoch Times reported. Other examples of changing water colour to pink across a much larger area has been observed at Cameron Falls in Waterton Lakes National Park, Canada and the Dead Sea, a salt lake between Israel and Jordan, to name a few.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/in-mumbai-wetland-a-spectacle-in-pink/story-GvaVadtSV84vftcToN7zQP.html
16-05-2020||Lucknow||Imam of Eidgah seeks relaxation for namaz on last Friday, Eid||Imam of Eidgah in Ayodhya, Samsul Qamar on Saturday sought permission to offer prayer in mosques on the last Friday of Ramzan and on the festive occasion of Eid.Imam Qamar handed over a memorandum addressed to the Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister Yogi Adityanath, to city magistrate and circle officer (city) on Saturday seeking permission for a collective offering of namaz in mosques on the last Friday of the ongoing Ramzan, on May 22.In the memorandum, Imam has pointed out that all shops in Ayodhya were open and even liquor shops were open.So, Muslims must be allowed to offer namaz in mosques on the last Friday of Ramzan and on the occasion of Eid, which is likely to be held on May 24 or 25, said Qamar. It may be pointed out that after the nationwide lockdown from March 25 all mosques and temples in Ayodhya are closed. Even on the nine-day long Navratra (March 25- April 2), all the temples in Ayodhya were closed and the Navratri Mela on last day of Navratra (April 2) was also cancelled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/imam-of-eidgah-seeks-relaxation-for-namaz-on-last-friday-eid/story-70gGEjPQcTDu3qWIXmBWGK.html
16-05-2020||Lucknow||Trying to escape corona, they fell victim to killer roads in UP||Uttar Pradesh is back in news for road accidents after a hiatus of one and a half months, with poor migrant workers in transit meeting with road accidents one after the other.Since public transport is still not available despite some travel relaxations during the Covid-19 lockdown in place since March 25, poor labourers stranded in various states have embarked upon a ‘foot march’ or taking whatever travel means—truck, tractor-trolley, bicycle, motorcycle and even handcart that comes their way to reach home.Authorities believe over-speeding facilitated by empty highways, desperation to reach destination early and fatigue of drivers are the primary reasons for such road mishaps.“Apparently, over-speeding and fatigue resulting into sleepiness are the reasons for a few unfortunate road accidents that have happened recently, including the one in Unnao on Saturday,” transport commissioner, Dheeraj Sabhu said.He said he had directed all the regional transport officers (RTOs) to deploy all the six interceptors on the highways fixing each interceptor’s duty for 16 hours a day in place of 6 hour duty in normal times. “We have asked them to ensure that any vehicle found over-speeding is intercepted and challaned,” Sahu said, adding, “Traffic police and highway/expressway authorities have their own interceptors.”A retired transport department official said migrants were forced to take unsafe travel modes like trucks etc because governments were not providing proper transportation to them.“Now, on the one hand governments are not able to provide a safe transport to these migrants, on the other hand truckers etc that are helping the poor workers reach their home are being threatened with action,” he said. This, he said would be a double whammy for the labourers. Despite all the tall claims and efforts, road accidents continue to be an epidemic in UP, killing more than 20,000 people every year, putting the state on the top of the national chart. “As many as 22,655 people died and another 28,932 were injured in 43572 cases of road accidents in UP in 2019,” sources said. “So, scores of migrants who somehow escaped the lethal coronavirus in the states they were stranded in, were not spared by killer roads in UP,” they pointed out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/trying-to-escape-corona-they-fell-victim-to-killer-roads-in-up/story-R3W1jiBdIkMwaP553nnvqI.html

Of the 11 patients discharged on Saturday, 10 — eight males, aged between 17-50 years, and two females, aged 21 and 27 — were from Bapu Dham Colony, and one — a 41-year-old man — is from Sector 30.“PGIMER is striving hard to bring more cheer and hope by consistently sharing the success stories of those getting cured after battling hard at the Covid hospital on campus,” a press statement said.MILESTONE FOR FRONTLINE WARRIORSPGIMER director Dr Jagat Ram said, “Most of these people have made incredible recoveries. But it also marks a milestone for our frontline warriors, a reiteration of faith that their incessant efforts can help their patients win the battle of Covid-19. With this increased pace of recoveries, we hope to continue to send off other patients to their homes soon.”Dr GD Puri, head, department of anaesthesia and intensive care, said, “Treating Covid patients along with comorbid conditions — resulting in compromised immunity owing to other ailments— is a huge challenge. But it is the team work that has resulted in such good outcome.”Though discharged, the cured persons will be home quarantined for 14 days as per the standard protocol. NO NEW CASE FOR A WEEK IN MOHALI Meanwhile, no new case of Covid-19 has been reported from Mohali since May 8.Confirming this, Mohali deputy commissioner (DC) Girish Dayalan said, “The total number of recovered people has risen to 95 (out of 105), with 35 patients getting discharged from the Gian Sagar Hospital in Banur on late Friday evening.” He said the efforts of the administration had started showing results. The DC added that the quarantine period of 3,328 people was over, while 1,253 were still under quarantine. The number of active cases remains seven, while the district has reported three deaths so far.THREE CURED IN PANCHKULAA day after two persons tested positive for Covid-19 in Panchkula, no new case was reported on Saturday. The number of active positive cases came down to three as three more patients were discharged. The total number of positive cases now stands at 25, of which 22 have been discharged.

16-05-2020||Mumbai||Consider private institutions’ suggestions on medical facilities for non-Covid patients: HC to state, BMC||The Bombay high court (HC) has directed the Maharashtra government and the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to consider the suggestions of petitioners and private institutions towards ensuring adequate medical facilities for the treatment of patients suffering from ailments other than Covid-19. The court has, however, said that the acceptance of suggestions would depend on whether they are realistic and within medical protocols.The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice AA Sayed on Friday had been apprised by three petitioners – Mehrwan Farshed, Dayanand Stalin and Mutahhar Khan – about the absence of requisite medical facilities for non-Covid-19 patients.The petitioners, through their respective public interest litigations (PILs), had pointed out that many non-Covid-19 patients had been unnecessarily suffering and even dying owing to lack of proper treatment of refusal of treatment altogether in government as well as private hospitals. One of the petitioners also pointed out that the families of elderly coronavirus patients had been forced to wait throughout the day for routine medical examination.The petitioners had prayed that in light of these submissions, HC should initiate the necessary action against hospitals and institutions that refuse treatment to patients suffering from other ailments. The petitioners also sought directions for the provision of adequate ambulances to ferry all patients and to convert state-run and private buses into ambulances if there was a shortage.Senior counsel Anil Sakhare, appearing for the BMC, vehemently opposed the petitioners’ allegations. He submitted that sufficient arrangements had been in place to look after the needs of non-Covid-19 patients.After hearing the submissions through video conferencing, the bench observed, “Having regard to the havoc wreaked by Covid-19 and in the absence of any therapeutic cure of the disease, every possible option ought to be explored so that the suffering of the people at large can be minimised to the extent possible.”With regards to the suggestions of the petitioners and private institutions, the bench said, “If indeed what the petitioners and the private institutions suggest are of any help or assistance to mankind, we see no reason as to why the state and the corporation may not consider the same in its true perspective.”The bench then directed the petitioners and private institutions to compile a set of their suggestions by Sunday and to forward it to the state and corporation for consideration upon due application of mind.“We make it clear that the suggestions shall be realistic so that they can be implemented and it shall also be ensured that the same are consistent with the extant medical protocol,” the court observed and directed the authorities to file a report indicating steps proposed to be taken based on suggestions and posted the hearing of the PILs on May 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/consider-private-institutions-suggestions-on-medical-facilities-for-non-covid-patients-hc-to-state-bmc/story-JXi3lACE1GBMT1L3QrZyHM.html
16-05-2020||Mumbai||FDA writes to pharma body, seeks price cap on PPE, N95 masks||After receiving several complaints of over-pricing of safety gear, the Maharashtra Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) has written to the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) seeking a price cap on Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and N95 masks. Since the outbreak of Covid-19 in the city, the demand for safety kits has surged by almost 400%. Many local traders have turned the pandemic situation into an opportunity to make quick money. The issue was two-part — the authenticity of the masks and the inflated prices they were being sold at.“In the interest of public health and to ensure sufficient availability at a reasonable rate, there is an urgent need to fix the ceiling prices of N95 masks, its equivalent masks and PPE kits on top priority to overcome the outbreak of Covid-19 in the country,” read the letter sent by Arun Unhale, commissioner of FDA, Maharashtra. Earlier, on the request of the department, the Ministry of Consumer Affairs fixed the ceiling price of two and three-ply marks and hand sanitizers, which helped curb hoarding of the items to a great extent.“Several traders are hoarding safety gear to increase the price. Then they sell those at double rates. The masks that earlier cost Rs 100 are now being sold at Rs 1,000. Also, there is no guarantee on the quality of products,” said Abhay Pandey, national president, All Food and Drug Licence Holder Foundation. Due to lack of knowledge about PPE, the traders are selling it off at a higher price without much regulation. Donors also end up buying without inquiries due to time constraints. “Private hospitals are being accused of charging exorbitant rates from patients. Prices of PPE have shot up two to three times. The government also doesn’t pay us for the safety gear. Due to the demand, we end up buying those at a higher rate,” said a doctor from a private hospital in Mumbai. Dr Sanjay Mukherjee, secretary of Medical Education and Drugs Department (MEDD) said that they have also written to NPPA making the same demand. “In response to the letter, we have also written to NPPA and waiting for their response,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/fda-writes-to-pharma-body-seeks-price-cap-on-ppe-n95-masks/story-3YxNMNl8OUjp92pelQ5AiO.html
16-05-2020||Mumbai||Civic chief allows diamond exports up to 100 packages a day||In a boost to diamond exports, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Wednesday allowed exports of up to 100 packages of diamonds every day. Every day a lottery system determines which trader will be allowed to export diamonds. Since manufacturing of diamonds has not begun in view of lockdown, merchants are sending stored diamonds according to order. Merchants are now awaiting permission to reopen their offices for assorting staff to get to work.Bharat Shah, legal advisor of Mumbai Diamond Merchants Association, said, “Diamond merchants have a lot of pending orders from the USA or Dubai. Since lockdown, everything has been closed for the past one-and-a-half months and business was at a standstill. Now the government has allowed up to 100 exports per day due to shortage of staff and carriers.”Shah said since manufacturing of diamonds has not yet started and manufacturing units in Mumbai and Surat, which source diamonds to merchants, are shut, all merchants are relying on stored items. “Since not everyone likes to store diamonds in bulk, not a lot of merchants are participating in this. But it is a good start. Now we are waiting for our offices to open so that workers can start assorting diamonds and packaging them.” Presently, only pre-packaged goods that were previously readied for export are being shipped.Shah said there are four to five agents at the customs’ point in the city where a lottery is drawn every day. The agents inform respective traders if their name has come up in the lottery, following which the selected trader sends packages for export.Municipal commissioner IS Chahal on Wednesday ordered opening up of Mumbai’s diamond market, and said, “I opened the entire diamond market of Mumbai. In a diamond market there is very limited and specialised labour and there are ₹5,000-crore exports waiting to happen, opening up the market can be beneficial. But none of this can happen at the cost of spreading Covid-19. “||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/civic-chief-allows-diamond-exports-up-to-100-packages-a-day/story-QUOhL7oQ7PPV28vjvG2nZJ.html
16-05-2020||Lucknow||UP: Cong seeks permission to run 1,000 buses for migrants||The Congress has requested the UP government for permission to run 1,000 buses to carry home migrant workers, who are arriving in the state in large numbers.In a letter requesting chief minister Yogi Adityanath, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said the party would bear the cost of running these buses from the Ghaziabad and Noida borders with the national capital.“Congress, in its responsibility towards hapless migrant labourers, wants to run 500 buses from the Ghazipur border and another 500 from the Noida border. All India Congress Committee will bear the cost of running these buses. We want permission to run 1,000 buses following all norms for protection against Covid-19 pandemic to help the migrant labourers,” said Priyanka Gandhi in her letter dated May 16 that a party delegation delivered to the chief minister’s office here on Saturday.Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee Ajay Kumar Lallu and Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader Aradhana Mishra led the delegation that also included senior leaders Naseemuddin Sidiqui, RK Chaudhary and Shyam Kishore Shukla. “We delivered the letter to the chief minister’s office as the issue needs immediate attention and seeking an appointment with chief minister may have taken time,” said Mishra, while expressing concern over the plight of migrant labourers.In her letter, Priyanka Gandhi further said, “Lakhs of migrant labourers are returning from different corners of the country. No arrangement has been made for the safe return of these migrant labourers walking down to their homes. So far, 65 migrant labourers have died in different road accidents. This number is more than those killed by Covid-19 pandemic in the state.”Calling migrant labourers nation-builders, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said, “The nation builders could not be left in such a condition and AICC is committed to help them.”Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has been sending letters to the chief minister and making some suggestions for fighting Covid-19..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-cong-seeks-permission-to-run-1-000-buses-for-migrants/story-VBEnxw4K3yJZSlwooSkHaO.html
16-05-2020||City||Close contacts of Covid patients can opt for home quarantine; six more cases emerge in Ghaziabad||In what may come as a breather for close contacts of Covid-19 patients, the UP government has issued a notification allowing them to remain in home quarantine if they fulfil certain conditions. The health department officials said those having large houses and more than one toilet may be allowed to remain in home quarantine, provided they follow the laid down norms and give an undertaking.“The notification is for close contacts of Covid-19 positive cases. The government has issued notification and it will be applicable to all persons admitted previously or to be admitted in the future. We have about 276 persons presently in facility quarantine but they can be allowed to remain in home quarantine, provided they give us an undertaking,” Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer (CMO), Ghaziabad, said.“Such persons will have to mandatorily install the Aarogya Setu app. The close contacts are immediate family members or people who were in direct contact with positive patients,” he said.According to the new norms, a person at the government-run quarantine facility can choose to remain in home quarantine for 14 days, provided they have large houses with more than one toilet.“The notification says that such persons will stay in a separate room with an attached toilet. The person will remain in isolation in their rooms and must not come in contact with any family member, especially a senior citizens or child or pregnant woman. So far, we were not allowing such facility to close contacts of Covid-19 patients,” the CMO said.According to Amit Mohan Prasad, UP’s principal secretary (health), the district officials will have to check the house and availability of separate toilets.“In another move, we have also notified fines which can be levied on people spitting in public places or moving in public places without masks. The first and second violation will attract a penalty of ₹100 while a subsequent violation may attract a fine of ₹500,” Prasad said.The officials said lockdown violations in the first instance will attract a penalty of ₹100-500; and ₹500-1,000 in the second instance and ₹1,000 for all subsequent violations.“Only one person is allowed on two-wheeler. If two persons are found, it will attract a penalty of ₹250 in the first instance, ₹500 in the second instance and ₹1,000 in the third instance. However, any person who doesn’t know driving and need to go to office, may take permission from a magistrate to have him/her driven there,” Prasad added.In Ghaziabad, six more Covid-19 cases emerged on Saturday taking the tally to 178.“One case is from Kaushambi and two from Sahibabad besides three from Khoda. We are taking up special drives in Khoda to contain the spread of infection. So far we have about 30 cases from Khoda,” Gupta said.Khoda’s executive officer KK Bhadana said most of the cases are from 10 of 73 residential pockets in Khoda and the infection has not spread beyond these pockets.Khoda was sealed on May 10 and entry/exit at 50 out of 52 points was stopped by officials.“We are taking up extensive sanitization in all areas and also in the 10 residential pockets where cases were reported. Apart from that, we have also sealed and barricaded 46 bigger and smaller internal lanes in Khoda. People are staying indoors and we have made arrangement to get essential items to all,” he said.The health department officials said that nine epicentre areas were desealed on Saturday after no case was reported from these areas over the last 14 to 28 days.The areas are located in parts of Sanjay Nagar, Vaishali sector 5 and 3, Pratap Vihar, Modinagar, Shalimar Garden Extension 1, Sikri Nagar and Vasundhara Sector 3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/close-contacts-of-covid-patients-can-opt-for-home-quarantine-six-more-cases-emerge-in-ghaziabad/story-ZPg6z9dGPNrucWBT9mpS8L.html
16-05-2020||City||Greater Noida begins work at bridge project to engage daily wage earners||GREATER NOIDA: The Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority (GNIDA) has resumed construction work at a bridge across the Hindon River, between Noida and Greater Noida, to engage daily wage workers who have been left jobless due to the shutting down of all work sites due to nationwide lockdown, imposed to contain the spread of the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic.The bridge is scheduled to come up between Greater Noida’s 60 metre-wide road in Knowledge Park-III, which is an educational hub, and Noida’s sectors 146/147. The budget of the construction of the bridge is Rs 65 crore. According to officials, who asked not to be named, it will have eight lanes having a width of 29 metres. The work on this project was started in January 2019 but the authority had to suspend construction on March 25, when the central government announced a nationwide lockdown, said the officials cited above. “We have resumed construction work at the site so that migrant workers can be engaged and they can earn a livelihood. We have directed that social distancing norms at the site be adhered to strictly so that workers can carry on with work while staying safe from coronavirus spread,” said Narendra Bhooshan, chief executive officer of the Greater Noida authority. The work was started after disinfecting the site, equipment, machines and surface, said the officials cited earlier.The authority, meanwhile, said that the bridge will ease traffic congestion on the city’s busiest traffic intersection - Pari Chowk - once it is ready. It added that upon completion, the bridge will aid commuters travelling between Noida and Greater Noida and give them an option of a different route than Pari Chowk, as they can use the LG traffic intersection road to reach Knowledge Park-III and then reach Noida’s Sector 147 via this bridge. It will cut travel time of commuters travelling from Greater Noida’s KP-III and Noida’s sectors 147, 148 and 149, among other areas, the authority said.This bridge was supposed to be completed in two-three years’ from the day the work was started.

16-05-2020||City||Realtors seek extra one year to complete housing projects amid lockdown||NOIDA: Real estate developers on Saturday said that the Uttar Pradesh Real Estate Regulatory Authority (UP-Rera) should given them an additional one year’s time to finish and deliver the housing units to homebuyers. In the wake of the Covid-19 lockdown, the regulator has given the developers the extra time of six months to complete realty projects. The realtors raised the demand during a webinar conducted by various real estate regulatory authorities from across the country. The webinar, conducted to celebrate the three years of the Rera Act, was also attended by Hardeep Singh Puri, Union minister for housing and urban affairs, Rera officials said. The Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 had come into force on May 1, 2017.  The developers put forth their demands before the Rera panel and the Union minister so that the real estate sector can tide over the Covid-19 crisis smoothly. “We have demanded that the government or Rera must give us additional one year’s time to finish and deliver the projects which have been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. As many migrant labourers have left the cities, resuming construction has become a challenging task. Also, the government must provide housing loan on low interest rate to create demand in the sector,” said RK Arora, UP president for National Real Estate Development Council (NAREDCO), a developers’ groupThe Rera officials said that in the past three years they have been successful in winning over the homebuyers’ trust and also developers have faith in the regulator.“Homebuyers have trust in the authority as they are getting their issues resolved in a time-bound manner. In the past three years, this authority has been able to win over the trust of both developers and homebuyers,” said Balvinder Kumar, member of UP-Rera.The officials said that the biggest achievement of the authority is that the developers cannot misuse the funds collected from homebuyers.“Now, we have escrow account facility for new realty projects. The funds in an escrow account is only used for a particular project. This transparency and monitoring of funds has helped us win buyers’ faith. And this is helping the projects get completed as per schedule. However, if Rera gets powers to issue directions to authorities such as Noida authority or Ghaziabad development authority, among other government bodies to enforce our orders, then it will help the realty sector in resolving long standing issues in a time-bound manner,” said Kumar.Union minister Puri assured developers that the government is looking into issues cropped up after nationwide lockdown, the Rera officials said.Many issues were discussed in webinar, including last mile funding to stuck projects, home loan at a rate of 6% and zero period for lockdown period, among others, the officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/realtors-seek-extra-one-year-to-complete-housing-projects-amid-lockdown/story-3uWp7rC0BSeqGKWqnOblQJ.html

16-05-2020||City||Gzb: Migrant workers who missed first train asked to wait till another arrangement||Ghaziabad: Migrant workers in Ghaziabad who have booked tickets online for the ‘Shramik Special’ trains to go to their home states or districts are facing a variety of issues. A number of workers who were to board the first train to Bihar on Friday, came yet again on Saturday at the Ghanta Ghar Ramlila Ground, where screening of passengers and boarding passes are getting issued.Ram Babu, a migrant worker from Madhepura in Bihar, was to board a train home on Friday, for which he had been issued a boarding pass the same day. His train departed with 1,420 passengers onboard on Friday night.As he was unable to get on the train, he came to the Ground again on Saturday, hoping to catch another train, which was scheduled for departure from the Ghaziabad junction at 7pm, but that endeavour, too, failed.“I somehow got a ticket booked online for train travel to my hometown. I procured the boarding pass on Friday but could not board the train as there was a heavy rush. My mother passed away a week ago in my hometown and I need to go home urgently. I went there on Saturday again but officials told me that the second train is not going to any place near to my home town,” said Babu, who worked as a daily wager at Narela in Delhi.Girdhari, another migrant worker who arrived from Haryana and had booked a train seat for Friday, came yet again on Saturday hoping to board the second train leaving for Bihar, being unable to board the previous day’s train.“After our passes were checked and our medical screening was done, we were told that the train is full and we will have to wait till the next train on the same route is announced,” he said.Likewise, Sita Devi, a domestic helper who stays at Bhovapur near Kaushambi and is from Chappra in Bihar, missed her train on Friday. She came with her two minor daughters and a son in the hope that officials will allow them seats in the train being run Saturday.“There was a lot of barricading by the police in Bhovapur and when we tried to move out, the cops drove us away. So we could not get to Ghanta Ghar. On Saturday, we walked all the way from Kaushambi but the officials told us that the other train will not go to our home district in Bihar,” she said.The train which left Saturday was scheduled to go through the three cities of Khagaria, Araria and Purnia in Bihar. The first train on Friday was scheduled for the three cities of Muzaffarpur, Chappra and Hajipur in Bihar.Ghonghar, another migrant, from Saharsa in Bihar, stayed at a shelter home after he could not board Friday train, while Mukesh Kumar and his two friends, who were to board Saturday’s train, were found by an HT team at Sukh Sagar Farm House in the Kavi Nagar Industrial Area around 3pm.“We were picked up by the police and brought to the shelter home. Till 3pm, we could not move out but later, when we showed them the SMS (of the train bookings), they allowed us to leave. It will take us more than one hour to reach the screening area and we hope that we catch our train after completion of formalities,” he added while leaving the shelter home with his friends.According to officials deputed to supervise passenger operations and screening process at the Ghanta Ghar Ramlila Ground, Friday’s train was full, with 1,420 passengers on board, while Saturday’s train will have a capacity of only 1,200 passengers.“Those who missed their journey should be submitting their boarding passes to us along with their mobile numbers. When the next train to their destination is announced, our teams will give them a call on priority. Till then, we have made arrangements for such persons for their stay at our shelter homes,” said Sanjay Kumar, the Ghaziabad Development Authority’s officer on special duty, who is supervising operations at Ramlila Grounds.“We cannot allow such passengers to board Saturday’s train as it has different routes and may drop them far away from their hometowns and they will face commuting issues again,” he added.Ghaziabad senior superintendent of police Kalanidhi Naithani, on the other hand, said that he has already issued instructions to personnel that anyone showing their train booking SMS or boarding passes should not be stopped.“Such passengers must be allowed to leave homes and reach Ghanta Ghar. We will issue instructions again in case any passengers have faced any such problem,” he added.Uttar Pradesh officials said so far, 449 trains have arrived in the state from different states.“Seventy two more trains will come to UP on Saturday. We have given permissions for another set of 286 trains which will arrive with migrant workers. Within the next 2-3 days, when these trains arrive, we will have about 9.5 lakh migrant workers who would have arrived in UP,” said Awanish Awasthi, UP’s additional chief secretary (home).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gzb-migrant-workers-who-missed-first-train-asked-to-wait-till-another-arrangement/story-AoW8Ojpv29Bdzugp5VLK3I.html

The NMRC, which runs the Aqua Line metro connected Noida and Greater Noida, said it is awaiting the government’s nod to resume its services.According to officials, commuters will have to wear face masks and they will be screened by thermal sensors before entry to the station. The limiting temperature will be 37.7 degrees Centigrade (about 99.86 Fahrenheit). The metro passengers also must have the “Aarogya Setu” app in their mobile phones. Without these prerequisites, no one would be allowed to travel, the guidelines say.The NMRC on Saturday issued a detailed guideline on how the metro service will function after curbs are lifted – a national lockdown in place to control the spread of the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease. However, the Corporation did not announce the date for resuming metro services.Ritu Maheshwari, managing director, NMRC, said initially for a few days, a 15-minute frequency of trains will be maintained. “Ridership trends will be analysed and any change due to demand will be made later,” she said.Commuters entering NMRC premises will have to apply sanitisers on their hands, which will be made available after temperature screening. To ensure adequate social distance, passengers will be advised to stand in queues at designated spaces by visible markings one metre apart at frisking zones, platforms and inside the train. All lifts will be closed, however, in case of request for senior citizens and physically challenged persons, they will be made available, with a maximum of three persons allowed in a lift at a time. NMRC officials said that digital payments will be preferred, instead of currency notes for tickets.The stations falling in containment zones shall remain closed and trains will not stop at these stations. “In case of doubt regarding any person having coronavirus infection/symptoms, the suspected person will not be allowed entry in station premises. They will be given proper instructions for seeking medical help. To handle a passenger or baggage suspected of being infected with the Sars-Cov-2 virus, two personal protection equipment (PPE) suits at each station will be made available for concerned staff deployed at the station,” said another NMRC official, requesting anonymity.Sandhya Sharma, deputy general manager, NMRC, said that prohibition on spitting will be strictly enforced in all metro trains and station premises. “In case of violations, a fine of Rs 500 fine will be imposed at first occurrence and Rs 1,000 for subsequent occurrence,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-noida-metro-rail-corporation-makes-aarogya-setu-app-compulsory-for-all-travellers/story-7Ys0wXWphVlm2pn9wOixYI.html
16-05-2020||Mumbai||2 more Mumbai cops succumb to Covid-19; Maharashtra toll up to 11||A 32-year-old assistant police inspector (API) posted at Dharavi and a 57-year-old police assistant sub-inspector (ASI) from Mumbai Police died from Covid-19 infection on Saturday and Friday, respectively.The API was posted as a crime detection officer at Shahu Nagar police station in Mahim (East), which covers the viral outbreak-hit Dharavi slums. After coming down with a fever and cough, he was sent on leave from May 10. On May 13, his sample was tested at Sion hospital and on Saturday morning his result came positive for Covid-19, according to zonal deputy commissioner of police, Niyati Thaker.Around 5am on Saturday, he fell in the bathroom at his Pratiksha Nagar residence in Sion and lost consciousness. He was rushed to Sion hospital, where he was declared dead before doctors could treat him. The assistant inspector also suffered from high blood pressure and diabetes.A colleague of the API, who was waiting at the hospital to take his body home, said, “He had a friendly and jovial nature. He had told his wife two days ago that he will die if he is not admitted to the hospital within 48 hours, and today he has left us.”“Due to fever and cough, he was home quarantined since Sunday. For the last two days, he was trying to get himself admitted at Sion hospital but he was not allowed admission as he had not tested positive for Covid-19. On Friday, a senior inspector of Shahu Nagar police station contacted the hospital to get him admitted but could not get a positive response. If he was admitted two days ago he could have survived,” said another colleague of the deceased police officer. Ahead of his death, the API had posted on social media: “Some gave Rs 5 crore while some gave Rs 500 crore. We (police) are giving our lives :)” The officer used to live with his wife, a doctor, and their four-year-old daughter.In the second incident, the deceased ASI was working as a driver and was posted in the motor transport (MT) section of the Mumbai Police in Nagpada. HE was sent on leave 15 days ago, as, at the age of 57, he fell into the high-risk group. He died on Friday at a hospital. Additional commissioner Atul Patil of MT department and Mumbai Police spokesperson refused to release any further information on the ASI’s death.Following the API’s demise, Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh visited the Shahu Nagar police station on Saturday. “It’s an extremely sad and unfortunate incident. He was quite young, just 32 years old. Everyone is Maharashtra is well aware of the efforts put in by the state police to fight against this pandemic. Police and health workers are risking their lives and working round the clock so we can win against the pandemic. Several of them have also lost their lives in the line of duty. The families of the deceased police personnel will be getting ₹65 lakh [compensation of ₹50 lakh, ₹10 lakh from the police welfare fund, and ₹5 lakh as insurance) and a government job to a family member. After a life is lost, any amount of money cannot compensate for it but our government and our public will always stand behind the police force. It’s a tough war but we will win it together,” Deshmukh said.1,140 Covid-19 cases in state, 11 deathsWithin the Maharashtra Police, 1,140 personnel tested positive for Covid-19 till Saturday, including 538 from Mumbai Police, of whom, 949 belong to the rank of constable. The death toll in the police force has risen to 11; eight from Mumbai and one each from Pune, Solapur, and Nashik Rural.

16-05-2020||Noida||95% ration card holders given food, claims administration||The Gautam Budh Nagar administration said it provided ration to almost 95% ration card holders in the first 11 days of May and that over 11,500 new cards were issued ever since the beginning of the lockdown on March 25.The prime minister had announced a nation-wide lockdown on March 24 which is now in its second extension scheduled to end on May 17. The situation had left thousands of people without means to feed themselves or their families. The district administration in April had formed 169 teams to identify and issue ration cards to all who requires it.“With the efforts of those teams working on the ground, almost 11,500 new cards have been issued ever since the lockdown started. We currently have 1,85,799 cards of whom 94.76% people were issued ration in May so far,” said the district supplies officer, Raj Narayan Yadav.The figure is slightly higher than in April when 91.38% card holders were provided with ration out of 1,80,657 active cards. Under the Pradhan Mantri Gareeb Kalyan Yojna for May, Gautam Budh Nagar is leading in the state with more than 68% distribution completed.Announcing the second tranche of economic aid, Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced that people could use their ration cards to obtain food from any of the public distribution systems in the country.In Gautam Budh Nagar district, these services are available at 134 distribution centers in the city and 244 in the rural belts.For those people who don’t have families, ration cards can be issued if they are from the same state and for migrants living alone, they can still get ration with their Aadhaar cards through the public distribution system, said officials. Further more, they are also entitled to relief from the chief minister’s rahat kosh and the administration is distributing those kits containing nine items including rice, pulses, atta, etc while the three authorities are also distributing cooked food in the district.Officials also said that surprise inspections are being carried out all over the district and three vendors have been booked under the Essential services act for various violations.However, despite all efforts that the administration has claimed to carry out, some people are still dependent on generosity of individuals for basic needs.“In the starting of the month, someone gave me Rs 500 with which I bought many things. But then we started running out and are almost begging now for anyone to help us out. Sometimes the Authority vehicle comes with khichdi, but they give a very small portion and it is not even close to helping my family of seven- husband and five children. Random people have been helping us out with ration,” said Sithadevi, a domestic help from Hoshiyarpur village.Her family received an uncooked food package from volunteers of an NGO and the family hopes that it will sustain them for the week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/95-ration-card-holders-given-food-claims-administration/story-qB2n6QFRI8gcFiMd0QfFyJ.html
16-05-2020||Noida||Won’t come back any time soon, say migrants as they board first train from Noida||Fifty-two days after the nationwide lockdown was imposed to curtail the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), effectively shutting down all industries and enterprises and rendering thousands of people jobless, migrant workers from Gautam Budh Nagar district boarded the first four special trains to Bihar on Saturday. With all interstate and interdistrict travel curtailed, many migrant workers had started walking back to their home towns in other states, unmindful of the daunting distances or the hardship of the journey. They heaved a sigh of relief on Saturday as the trains chugged in to the station to ferry them home.The trains on Saturday left for Aurangabad, Buxar, Rohtas and Siwan districts of Bihar from Dadri and Dankaur railway stations.“We are really happy and thankful that we got this train. We were almost losing hope of getting one and was thinking of walking back. Also, this lockdown had taught us the value of home and what’s it like being away during such a crisis. I am not returning any sooner, not even if normalcy returns next week,” Sukhendra Kumar, who hails from Aurangabad district, and lives at Sector 78, said as he boarded boarding a train at Dadri station.Despite the high registrations of migrants from Bihar alone – around 68,000 – the turnout at stations was low. Of the 1,300 passengers registered to go to Aurangabad, only 978 showed up, even as officials held the train back for two hours and kept coordinating with families which were on their way.For Buxar, there were about 1,300 registrations, of which only 656 boarded trains. For Rohtas, 1,524 passengers turned out from the nearly 1,600 who had registered.A total of 1,520 turned up to board the train to Siwan of the 1,600 who registered.Officials said this could be the effect of industries reopening. The fare and food on the journey were sponsored by the district administration. “I received a text message on my phone confirming that my wife and I got seats on this train, and this restored some faith in the system. A bus was deployed to our area that brought us here to the station, and we were not charged any fare, neither for the bus not the train. Upon screening we were given tickets, food packets, and water,” said Jitendra Pandey, a resident of Aurangabad who boarded a passenger train at Dadri along with his wife Rita Pandey and two children. Pandey, who works at a mobile company in Noida, said he will remain at his home town for at least a month or more.Umesh Kumar, another migrant from Rafiganj, Aurangabad, worked at a shop in Noida and lived at Harola said that one of his neighbour from Buxar informed him about the online registration process last week and he received the seat confirmation on Friday. “There were a number of issues during this lockdown, like not having enough to eat, a situation I would never have faced at home,” he said.District magistrate Suhas LY said, “We are still receiving registrations from migrant workers who wish to go home, and more trains are being arranged for all those already registered for Bihar. However, since industries have reopened, some of them have decided to stay back and they are most welcome.” He, along with police commissioner Alok Singh, inspected the arrangements at stations and saw off the passengers. A battalion of Rapid Action Force (RAF), about 50 police personnel and 50 railway protection force (RPF) personnel at each of the stations ensured social distancing.He added that transport arrangements will also be made for passengers from states other than Bihar and also for those from other districts of Uttar Pradesh.“Our teams are on the ground and there are many migrants from Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, etc. We will soon start the registrations for these states and make transport arrangements. Registration for interdistrict has already started,” Suhas said. According to the health officials, the screening of passengers began around 8am while teams supervised the sanitisation of trains.“We had 20 two-member teams screening passengers for Covid-19 symptoms. A few passengers had walked to the station and hence their body temperature was high. Those passengers were made to rest and screened again, sanitised and permitted to board the train,” Dr Sanjeev Saraswat, from the community health centre, Dadri, said. No one was found with Covid-like symptoms, the doctor said.Meanwhile, the district administration unveiled the online link -- www.tinyurl.com/pravasi-shramik-UP -- for the migrant workers belonging to Uttar Pradesh to register. The administration will arrange transport to all 74 districts of the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/won-t-come-back-any-time-soon-say-migrants-as-they-board-first-train-from-noida/story-nUnEOz7bJbq4iniLsaR7RL.html

The officers have also been asked to take all possible legal action against such persons, including under the relevant provisions of the Disaster Management and Epidemics Act etc.The DGP said the CM had made it clear that owing to acute economic stress in the country arising from the curfew, the state government must mobilise all possible revenue. Following the CM’s orders, the DGP has directed CPs and SSPs to hold a meeting via video conferencing with DSPs of sub-divisions and SHOs to make it absolutely clear that if any illegal liquor factory is found operational in his area of jurisdiction, as in Khanna and Rajpura recently, he will be liable to be shifted out with legal and departmental action initiated against him. He will also become ineligible for SHO and public dealing postings in future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/capt-tells-police-to-snuff-out-illicit-liquor-biz-in-state/story-zORGdoZxC09LLAjG1hrJiP.html
16-05-2020||Mumbai||ICMR yet to approve pool testing in Maharashtra as state fails to meet criteria||Twenty-two days after the state government announced it would start pool testing, not a single pool test for Covid-19 has taken place as the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) is yet to give Maharashtra the go-ahead to for the same.According to ICMR guidelines, to conduct pool testing, less than 2% of the total tests conducted should be positive. The state’s percentage of positive cases is more than that at present, said a senior state official.“I have been following on the matter but ICMR is yet to approve pool testing in the state,” said public health minister Rajesh Tope.Till Saturday the state conducted 2,61,783 tests, of which 30,706 (8.52%) came back positive. Pool testing involves checking up to five samples in a single test. The pool testing algorithm involves the Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) screening of a specimen pool, comprising multiple samples. In case a pool test comes positive, each sample is tested individually. At present, one sample is tested at a time.“With the new form of testing, the state’s capacity would increase 10 fold. Pool testing could help us identify new clusters or hotspots faster,” said a senior health official.After a meeting with Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan on April 24, Tope had announced that the state would start pool testing and clinical trial of plasma therapy soon. Clinical trials of plasma therapy have started but there has been no progress on pool testing.The ICMR guidelines state that pool testing should be used only in areas with a low prevalence of Covid-19. It further states that in areas with 2-5% of the samples test positive, pooling for PCR screening may be considered only in community surveys or surveillance among asymptomatic individuals. The guidelines strictly exclude pooling samples of individuals in known contact with confirmed cases.“All over the state, the percentage of positive reports is more than 2% and that’s why we are not eligible to conduct tests. The state can do it on its own but we prefer to follow the guidelines issued by ICMR as it is the technical nodal agency. There are also different issues involved in this such as accuracy of tests, number of samples being used for testing, etc,” said a senior official from the medical education department.He said that pool testing will help in multiplying the number of tests conducted. For instance, labs which have a capacity of 100 tests a day, will be able to conduct up to 1,000 tests daily.The state has enhanced its testing capacity from 100 samples a day to around 22,000 a day. This includes 57 laboratories (33 government and 24 private) with RT-PCR tests, six laboratories (three government and three private) of CB-NAAT tests, and two private laboratories for TrueNat testing. All are approved by ICMR as Covid-19 tests.“When we started, we had only one functional lab at Kasturba Hospital with a capacity of 100 samples a day. The capacity has gone up 220 times in about two months. We lead India and have more capacity than many countries. Testing in Maharashtra is strictly as per ICMR guidelines,” said another official from the state medical education department.To assess the spread of infection among the masses, the state government last month had announced that it would conduct antibody testing. This too could not be started as ICMR found that the testing kits were faulty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/icmr-yet-to-approve-pool-testing-in-maharashtra-as-state-fails-to-meet-criteria/story-USINCxjXHe2nKPWPcxQaUP.html

The workers initially pelted stones on the office of the private construction company that hired them and later at a police vehicle when the cops arrived at the site.One of the labourers’ leaders, seeking anonymity, said the workers had requested the company officials to send them home as they found it tough to live here under the prevailing crisis amid the Covid-19 pandemic. The company had promised to send them home by May 16. “However, when the workers gathered near the company office on Saturday, the officials told them that they will be charged Rs 3,000 per head for their bus journey. Expressing their inability to pay money, the workers started protesting. The company officials then called police which used force to disperse the workers,” he said.Bathinda senior superintendent of police (SSP) Nanak Singh, however, denied use of force on the labourers or any stone pelting by them. “The workers had gathered at the site demanding arrangements for their journey and we convinced them that they will be sent home through special trains.” Meanwhile, a video has surfaced on the social media in which angry workers can be seen pelting stones on the office of the construction company. In another video, workers are seen pelting stones at a police vehicle.A company official looking after the construction work said around 1,600 workers were engaged in the construction work when the lockdown started. “Around 300 of them have already left for their states while 1,300 are still working at the site. Construction work had resumed at the site on April 20 onward.”The out-patient department (OPD) services at the AIIMS here started in December last year after construction of the OPD block while work on other buildings is going on.Bathinda sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Amarinder Singh Tiwana said the AIIMS officials have been told that they will be intimated whenever a train is available to take these workers to their home states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/construction-workers-at-bathinda-aiims-indulge-in-stone-pelting/story-8SOBykAwD94eRCyQNxS9BN.html

On return, he tested negative for Covid-19, but his parents turned out infected and were isolated in the hospital.“As other family members of the boy had also tested positive for Covid-19, nobody was there to look after him in his parents’ absence. Moreover, the child insisted to live with his parents. Under these circumstances, the administration decided to allow him to live with his parents in the isolation ward, where total 40 patients were admitted,” said Gurdaspur civil surgeon Dr Kisan Chand.Gurnoor’s father said, “Though we were asymptomatic, keeping him (son) with us in the isolation ward was risky as we had tested positive and many infected patients were there. We kept him with us because we had no other option and my son was not ready to live without us. However, we took every precaution advised by the doctors.”He was tested twice, and the results were negative both times. After his parents recovered and were discharged from the hospital on Thursday, he was presented with a siropa (robe of honour) by Punjab jails and cooperation minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa in the presence of senior district officials.When asked how the boy was able to resist the infection, Dr Chand said, “First of all, his immunity played a major role. Secondly, we gave special attention to this case to keep him fit. Besides ensuring that the family wore masks and sanitised hands at all times, we asked the child to sleep on a separate bed alone, and he followed the advice. This helped him keep the infection at bay.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/6-year-old-untouched-by-covid-19-despite-15-day-exposure-to-ill-patients/story-MshC4k3pHdVs86NgB87XoL.html

He was addressing the Panchayat Pradhans of gram panchayats of Solan and Sirmour district.“Panchayat pradhans should come forward to help the poor and migrant workers by providing them food and shelter,” said the chief minister adding that panchayats must also come forward to provide masks to people.He also urged them to support the state authorities in sensitising the people of their respective areas about coronavirus as well as ensure that the people who had arrived from other parts of the country do not jump home quarantine.Thakur said that PRIs were the key part of the democratic setup.CM added that more than 1.15 lakh people have arrived in the state from various parts of the country and about 60,000 more have applied for e-passes.“There was only one active Covid-19 case on May 1 and the number has now gone up to 34,” he said.Thakur said there was no need to panic as the government was fully prepared to deal with any situation.Trade union, civil rights group draw attention of govt towards plight of migrantsDHARAMSHALA: Over 30 organisations comprising trade unions, civil rights groups, youth alliances, independent social organisations from across the country on Saturday issued an appeal in support of workers from other states stranded in Himachal Pradesh.They stressed urgent coordination between states to ensure and facilitate the safe return of migrants to their homes.The appeal specifically highlights the distressful state of thousands of migrant workers in the Baddi-Barotiwala-Nalagarh industrial area and the lack of response of the administration and respective governments to ensure urgent evacuation of those who want to leave.It raised the plight of workers from Uttar Pradesh, who have long registered themselves on the online portals to travel back but were yet to get the permission.The pressure groups also alleged that “private bus operators were charging exuberant fares from already deprived people and the government is not helping the poor”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jai-ram-asks-panchayati-raj-representatives-to-help-poor-especially-migrant-workers/story-1J6u8TO7oSnRiOioBgxGxH.html

He also added that a decision with regard to summer vacations, which falls in June, will also be taken accordingly. High court’s work is restricted to hearing of urgent cases only, but with prior mentioning since March 16. Currently, two division benches and 10 single benches are taking up around 200 cases through video conferencing, whereas, daily listing of the cases on a normal day in high court remains around 2,500-3,000.Punjab and Haryana High Court Bar Association secretary Rohit Sud said the court should ease listing norms and allow hearing of fresh cases without mentioning. “We had given a charter of demands and sought for physical hearing to resume in courts. But final decision is to be taken by the administration,” he added. Bar Council of Punjab and Haryana (BCPH) chairman Karanjit Singh underlined that the high court should experiment with allowing physical hearing at least on trial basis and designate some benches for the same.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hc-defers-pending-cases-hearing-till-july/story-zwowBGoJPzvHm5Cjy8iR9J.html

The animal is under watch at Wildlife Rescue SOS’s transit facility in Gurugram. The animal was found by locals in Sohna’s Mandawar village on May 12, and rescued by members of the NGO and the district wildlife department. Dr Abhishek Kumar Singh, veterinary officer, Wildlife SOS, said, “The hyena was severely injured by the wire snare. We were worried about internal haemorrhage. We treated the animal for deep lacerations and profuse bleeding from tongue and mouth. The snare could have been fatal. The hyena is currently under observation and we are administering painkillers and antibiotics.”Mandawar, where the animal was found, is part of a known wildlife corridor which runs through the Aravalli mountain range from Gurugram to Sariska, in Rajasthan.

16-05-2020||City||Amid labour crunch, Punjab agriculture dept faces herculean task ahead of paddy sowing season||With less than a month left for the paddy sowing season to start in Punjab, it is going to be a herculean task for the state’s agriculture department to arrange all logistics in time.Amid an acute shortage of migrant labour due to the exodus triggered by the Covid-19 outbreak in the state, the department has to arrange transplantation machines and local labour for farmers this Kharif season.The state government has already advanced paddy sowing season by 10 days — from June 20 to June 10.Kahan Singh Pannu, agriculture secretary, said work has been divided into phases to deal with labour shortage. “First, the department has decided to reduce at least 3 lakh hectare area under paddy cultivation from 29.3 lakh hectare last year to 26.3 lakh hectare this year,” he said. “Second, the target area under direct seeding of rice has been set at 4 lakh hectare, which is 20% more than that last year.”By shifting around 7 lakh hectare area from traditional paddy, the department is now making other arrangements, including transplantation machines and labour for sowing paddy over around 22 lakh hectares, he said.Pannu said the government has already roped in “best manufacturers” of farm implements to meet the demand of transplantation machines.“Manufacturing has been slowed down due to the lockdown, but we are hopeful to get 200 such machines before the start of the season. The state is already equipped with more than 300 such machines,” he said.Meanwhile, the agriculture department has estimated 12.5 lakh labourers will be required to sow paddy in 30 days.On labour crunch, Pannu said they are going to engage local labour to augment the permanent agriculture labour working with farmers. 10% paddy area to be shifted to cotton, maizeSutantar Kumar Airi, director, agriculture, Punjab, said that of the 10% area to be shifted from paddy cultivation, the department is expected to divert 1.6 lakh hectare to cotton, one lakh hectare to maize and the remaining to basmati varieties. “We are reviewing the ground situation on daily basis and are preparing district-wise requirement lists. We have been appealing to farmers at block level to go for crop diversification so as to compensate for the labour shortage,” Airi said. Meanwhile, an official, who did not wish to be named, said pushing farmers towards crop diversification is going to be a major challenge for the department.“Farmers have always been reluctant to stop the cultivation of water-guzzling paddy in the past. To promote diversification, the government needs to ensure remunerative prices for maize and cotton,” the official said.Sowing cost to increase with limited resources Jagmohan Singh, general secretary of Bhartiya Kisan Union (Dakaunda), said the cost of sowing paddy is going to increase as farmers have to shell out more money to arrange local labour.“The migrants charge between ₹2,500-3,000 per acre for sowing paddy while Punjab’s local labour demand between ₹ 5,000-5,500 per acre for the same job,” he said.Singh said the Centre and state government should announce some financial support to farmers beside providing the required logistics.“Though the state government advanced paddy sowing by 10 days, the collegium of 10 farm unions have demanded to start the season from June 1, so as to meet the demand of local labour and transplantation machinery. The farmers also want the Centre to increase the minimum support price for paddy,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/amid-labour-crunch-punjab-agriculture-dept-faces-herculean-task-ahead-of-paddy-sowing-season/story-r8QPoUf2JOQhYbIJAw5rCK.html

The police said the accused persons had asked for ₹1.25 lakh from 53 migrant workers, which included women and children, to ferry them to Malda district in West Bengal.According to the police, the incident was reported around 1am when the police received a tip-off that two men were asking migrants to board the canter near Chotu Ram Chowk.The two accused persons have been identified as Jai Prakash, a native of Kanpur, and Raviful, a native of Malda, West Bengal. The police said the duo had fixed the price for transporting people to West Bengal at ₹1.25 lakh.Ved Parkash, station house officer (SHO), Sector 5 police station, said, “A police team rushed to spot and arrested the duo after they could not produce the movement passes. The migrant workers were taken to a government relief centre in Sector 15,” said SHO.A case was registered against the suspects under sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) and 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) of the Indian Penal Code(IPC) and Section 51(b) of Disaster Management Act at Sector 5 police station on Saturday, said the police.On Thursday, the police had arrested two men in separate cases for allegedly trying to ferry passengers to other states without carrying movement passes.

16-05-2020||Gurugram||Ahead of Lockdown 4.0, shop owners, retailers want Covid-19 restrictions to be relaxed||Shop owners and retailers in the city, who have been badly impacted by the ongoing lockdown to counter the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak, want the government to announce relaxations as businesses have been severely impacted and many of them are unable to pay salaries to their employees and rents to their property owners. The Retailers Association of India (RAI) has now written to Haryana chief minister, seeking relief from the curbs that have been imposed on business activities.Business owners said that opening of shops only twice a week that was allowed in Lockdown 3.0 is not enough for sustainable retail operations as a large majority of buyers prefer to remain indoors. “Shops selling non-essential products and services open only twice a week and this has hindered businesses badly. It is time that we start living with Covid 19 and allow economy to revive,” said Pankaj Tomar, a business owners, who said that paying rentals has become a difficult proposition.Gurugram has around 40 malls and shopping centres spread across the city and all of them have been closed since the authorities announced the lockdown on March 24. The city has been designated as an orange zone but the restrictions imposed on people and business have been strict due to its close proximity to Delhi and the rising number of Covid-19 cases in the district.The Retailers Association of India (RAI) , which represents over 13,000 retail businesses in the country, said that over 3 million people in Haryana are employed in this industry particularly in Gurugram and the business has been affectedly badly.“At least 3 million people are involved in retail jobs across Haryana and particularly in Gurugram, which is a retail hub with over 35 to 40 malls, which are visited by people from all across the National Capital Region(NCR). Opening of the malls and other establishments is crucial to create demand as otherwise the supply chain and manufacturing would not be able to function. We have written to the Haryana government to open up retail with adequate safeguards, such as social distancing,” said Kumar Rajagopalan, CEO, RAI.The letter written by RAI to the Haryana government on Monday said, “We are writing to request you to permit opening of mall in all zones except containment zone under a mandated standard operating procedure(SOP). The mall eco-system is critical to economic revival and employment generation in manufacturing and retail sector. Malls act as the front-end for 45% of India’s organised retail (sic).”The association further said that over 100 million jobs have been affected by the closure of malls and organised retail. Opening of malls will declog the inventory and supply chain of the manufacturing system. It also said that almost 12% of the electronic industry has occupancy in malls, 20% of malls are occupied by food and beverages industry, around 39% of footwear retails through malls.Meanwhile, several shopkeepers in the HSVP markets in the city also said that they were struggling to pay rent as businesses were shut. “We have had no business for the last one month and the government should announce some relief in rentals for tenants,” said a shop owner on condition of anonymity.A senior Haryana government official, when asked about the matter said that opening of malls and other establishments depends on the directions that would be issued by ministry of home affairs(MHA) for Lockdown 4.0, which starts from May 18. “The directions have to come from Centre,” he said, preferring anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/ahead-of-lockdown-4-0-shop-owners-retailers-want-covid-19-restrictions-to-be-relaxed/story-eVbFJR2406D7B2F6EcNUlN.html
16-05-2020||City||Haryana: Intensive surveillance in urban slums of 5 districts to contain Covid-19 spread||Gurugram: In a bid to control the spread of coronavirus in the highly affected districts of Haryana -- Gurugram, Faridabad, Jhajjar, Panipat and Sonepat – the state health department has initiated intensive surveillance in the urban slums of these districts. Going by the government data, Jhajjar slums have reported the maximum number of Covid-19 cases at 75 (total cases 90), followed by Faridabad which has seen 34 positive cases (total cases 144) from these areas. While not a single Covid-19 case (total cases 193) has been reported from Gurugram slums, 14 people in Panipat (total cases 36) and four in Sonepat (total cases 134) slums have tested positive for the deadly virus.Interestingly, Gurugram has the highest population of 1.1 million residing in the urban slums, according to the data shared by the state health department. According to health officials, about 500 health workers have screened at least one million people from March onwards through door-to-door surveillance in the urban slums of Gurugram and found 3,000 people with influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory illness (SARI). Of the 3,000 people, samples of at least 459 have been collected for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test and 363 for antibody test using rapid testing kits (RTKs). The data shows that 193 Covid-19 cases have been reported in Gurugram till now, but none of them is from urban slums.Faridabad has a population of more than one million in urban slums. The officials said that mostly ASHA and auxiliary nurse midwife (ANM) workers, who are doing surveillance in slums, are also focusing on immunization programme of children and pre/post-natal care of women.Rajeev Arora, additional chief secretary, health department, said that the focus is on densely populated clusters in urban areas to prevent the contagious disease from spreading. “All across the country, Covid-19 cases are being reported from the urban areas. Gurugram and Faridabad are highly urbanized with a large population living in urban slums. They are mostly domestic helps, workers and drivers, who work in different parts of the city.”“Their intensive screening and testing is crucial to prevent spread of Covid-19 cases in districts where cases are increasing,” said Arora.According to him, the surveillance has increased considering positive cases from urban slums could increase as these are highly congested areas where maintaining social distance is quite difficult. The health officials said that the state has initially witnessed a wave of coronavirus cases with a travel history. Later, cases related to attendees of Tablighi Jamaat came in and of late people with links to Delhi were found Covid-19 positive. In Gurugram’s Khandsa mandi, at least 25 people were found positive who had direct or indirect links to the national capital’s Azadpur mandi, a Covid-19 hot spot. Likewise, it affected Jhajjar, Sonepat, Panipat and Faridabad.“It is the third round of surveillance in urban slums to identify potential Covid-19 cases to break the chain of transmission. We have been doing random sampling in affected areas targeting different population group to trace cases,” Arora said, adding that despite surge in the number of positive cases, none of the districts from Haryana is among the 30 worst-affected districts across the country.On Saturday, the Union ministry of health and family welfare held a meeting with senior officials from the 30 municipal areas which are contributing at least 80% of the country’s Covid -19 cases. These areas are in states like Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Punjab and Odisha.“None of our districts are as badly affected as Indore, Ahmedabad or Mumbai. Timely tracing and testing of cases has helped us,” said Arora.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/haryana-intensive-surveillance-in-urban-slums-of-5-districts-to-contain-covid-19-spread/story-eJBXBWSM4gYyAZPFuWANYM.html
16-05-2020||Gurugram||Faridabad increases containment zones to 26||The Faridabad district administration, on Saturday, increased the number of containment zones in the district from 14 to 26, with new additions in the residential areas. The district administration added 14 new areas to the revised list of containment zones, while two zones in the district were de-notified after no Covid-19 cases were reported from these areas in the last 28 days.Four new cases of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) were reported on Saturday, bringing the total count of people who have been tested positive in the district to 144. Officials said 75 people have been discharged so far and five have succumbed to the infection. The rest are undergoing treatment.The newly added containment zones in the city are: areas of Sanjay Colony in Sector 23, Sector 23 A, plot numbers 1136 to 2982 of Sector 62, Adarsh Colony, pockets of EWS plots of Sector 18 Housing Board Colony, Fatehpur Chandila, village Mahola, village Sihi, Shiv Sharda Colony in Ballabhgarh, Sector 9, Sector 17, Sector 10, Indira Colony. Lanes adjacent to Railway Road and the sector-dividing roads of sectors 22 and 24 have also been categorised as containment zones.Yashpal Yadav, deputy commissioner, Faridabad, said that at least one Covid-19 case has been reported in the last four days from these new areas. “Most of the persons recently infected with SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes Covid-19) were people who had visited Delhi. Most of them had contracted the virus after coming in contact with a Covid-19 patient in Azadpur Sabji Mandi or those who had returned from Delhi with the infection,” he said.Yadav said they have adopted a new method on Friday for designating a containment zones after a meeting with health department and police teams.“Earlier, we used to take a three-kilometre area as containment zone but now we are covering a radius of 500 metres from the epicentre of the infection and are conducting screening, sampling, and testing of suspected cases residing in that area. We have assigned tasks to all the ASHA (Accredited Social Health Activist) workers and each one of them has been asked to collect 25 samples,” he said.The administration is also taking details from the chemist shop regarding the sale of fever, flu, and cough medicines and have been asked to take down the mobile number and residential address of each customer.Faridabad had sealed its borders with Delhi last month, prohibiting the entry of all commuters, including essential workers, until May 17 and the police said the plan is likely to remain the same for this month.KK Rao, Faridabad’s commissioner of police, said that they have increased police deployment in the containment zones and only essential supply is allowed in the area. “We hold regular meetings in a day with the health department and district administration to discuss the ongoing plan of action and preparation. Also, to check the progress of cases and check the data compiled by the people who return from the field in the evening. We all are connected through a WhatsApp group and police teams are sent with the health workers so that they can easily conduct the sampling ,” he said.The deputy commissioner further said, “We had sent the samples of 6,673 people, of which 144 have tested positive and the results of 684 are awaited. At least 59 people are currently hospitalised.”The infected people have been admitted to the ESIC hospital, the officials said, adding that at least 7,4341 people are currently under home quarantine in the district and 5,897 people are on surveillance for Influenza-like illness.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/faridabad-increases-containment-zones-to-26/story-CN2VTNSGKhEj95pWzTJTOL.html
16-05-2020||Gurugram||GMDA finds 48 sewer lines illegally connected to surface drains, seeks police action||During a two-day stormwater drain cleaning drive, which began on Thursday, the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) found as many as 48 points where sewer lines from the neighbouring residential and commercial establishments have been connected to the surface drains illegally.The drive was conducted in the city along all the master roads. The GMDA disconnected 24 out of the 48 illegal connections during the drive itself. Later, the authority wrote letters to the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) and the Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation (HSIIDC) to trace the source of these 48 lines and initiate action accordingly.The drive came in the backdrop of a survey by a GMDA team last week, in which the team found flooding in the stormwater drains in sectors such as 37, 23, 44, 45, 47, 51, 57, Udyog Vihar, Pace City and other areas.Pradeep Kumar, GMDA chief engineer, said, “Stormwater drains should not carry water at all unless there is flooding due to rains. The poor quality of water, along with foul smell and holes connected through sewer lines indicated that illegal sewer connections have been established from residential and commercial areas of the city.”Soon after the nationwide lockdown was imposed on March 25, VS Kundu, CEO, GMDA, had issued instructions to field officials engaged in master services, such as water supply and sewers, to do regular disinfection of treatment plants, machines, sewer drains, cleanliness, desilting and adhere to all the requisite Covid-19 guidelines. Kumar said, “Since Covid-19 cases are on the rise, we are taking utmost care to keep drains clean and in a hygienic condition, as per the top officials’ instructions. Drains belong to us, but the source of sewer lines belong to MCG and HSIIDC areas. We have written to them to disconnect them and initiate police action. So far, 24 lines have been disconnected.”GMDA also held a meeting with the officials of MCG and HSIIDC on Saturday. Satyawan Singh, the MCG superintending engineer, said, “We are disconnecting these lines and will also initiate police action against the offenders after we trace their source.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gmda-finds-48-sewer-lines-illegally-connected-to-surface-drains-seeks-police-action/story-simFFCqaInoujJoZ1NVhSN.html
16-05-2020||City||Medical tourism companies turn to telemedicine in wake of Covid-19||Gurugram: In a bid to restart the flow of revenue, cash-strapped medical tourism (or ‘medical value travel’) companies in Gurugram and the National Capital Region (NCR) have turned their attention to telemedicine services, with some having already begun telephonic consultations with patients in west Asia, Uzbekistan and Myanmar. Telemedicine refers to the delivery and facilitation of health and health-related services including medical care, provider and patient education, health information services and self-care, via telecom and digital communication technologies, a practice that has gained significance globally over the past few years with advances in technology. On March 25, India issued the first central guidelines on telemedicine, which were gazette notified on May 16. While these guidelines are intended for telemedicine being practised within India, medical tourism companies are now using telemedicine services to retain patients living overseas, who are no longer able to travel to India to seek treatment.Gurugram, according to MVT [medical value travel] company owners, is India’s largest medical tourism hub, where close to 50% of NCR’s medical tourists seek treatment. With business dependent on international travel, and with no new patients expected to arrive in the country anytime soon, industry owners say telemedicine is their next best option to keep business afloat.Vinay Aggarwal, proprietor of Shinon Collaborative Consultancy, an MVT firm operating in Gurugram, said, “MVT companies that have offices overseas have already started interacting with governments in other countries, seeking permission to start telemedicine services. So far we have been able to roll out these services to our clients in Myanmar and Uzbekistan, after getting our doctors accredited with Myanmar Medical Council and the Uzbeki health ministry.” Amit Sharma, founder and CEO of eEXpedise Healthcare, another MVT company operating in Gurugram, said they have initiated such services in Dubai, with doctors who are accredited by the Dubai Health Authority. “But it has been a slow process. Speaking to departments in other countries, getting their permissions in order, it all takes time. But we see a huge demand for telehealth services in west Asian and African countries, which is where our focus is now shifting,” Sharma said.FISCAL STIMULUS TO PROVIDE MUCH-NEEDED LIQUIDITYIn the days immediately after the lockdown, MVT proprietors were sceptical of reviving the industry without a dedicated bailout package. “However, a few positive developments have happened since then,” according to Sharma. Sharma explained that under the fiscal stimulus package announced by the Centre, MVT companies will be able to avail of the same benefits as other micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), such as those involved in manufacturing. “The service sector, which medical tourism is a part of, will also be allowed to avail of distress and non-collateral loans. This will be a major liquidity lifeline for us while we adapt our businesses to the constraints of Covid-19,” he said.A senior director at the Federation of Indian Chambers of and Industry (Ficci), who is directly overseeing the Indian MVT sector (which is valued at between US$5 and 6 billion), said, “We are making a representation on Monday to the ministries of finance and ministry of commerce and industry to recognise MVT as an independent MSME industry. Companies are still straddled with the cost of wages, office space and so on. Until newer revenue models are established, MVT should be allowed the same benefits as the manufacturing sector, seeing as it brings in a substantial amount of foreign exchange in the country.” The Ficci official, seeking anonymity, also concurred that telemedicine could be a viable business model for MVT companies during the Covid-19 pandemic. “Preliminary consultations and even post-operative care, to an extent, can be carried out over the phone for overseas patients. It is necessary to assist these enterprises in making the shift to telehealth services,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/medical-tourism-companies-turn-to-telemedicine-in-wake-of-covid-19/story-YA0OpXnbjgmvZfsRoHObRP.html

16-05-2020||Gurugram||Children connect with their roots through online storytelling sessions||Dressed in an Avengers T-shirt, Aariv Prakash, a 9-year-old resident of Sector 50 comes on the camera with his mother, Monisha Prakash, to narrate the tale of Kalpavriksh, a mythical wishing tree. They start with a jingle and then introduce their first character, Babu, a turban-wearing stuffed minion walking across the desert. The mother-son duo then follows his journey of wishes as he travels across the desert. Almost once a week they come together to narrate folktales on their YouTube channel to break the monotony of the lockdown. “In this folktale from Rajasthan, we used a minion as a puppet. My son said let’s use him as a character; so we dressed him up in a turban,” said Prakash, an educator. She adds that the idea behind the videos is to engage children and to help them think creatively in terms of telling stories. The mother-son duo has so far created over 10 videos on their social media handles. Their channel includes tales of Akbar-Birbal, Tenali Raman, animals and popular folktales children hear in their childhood.For the longest time, grandparents and extended family members have been responsible for telling stories. During these sessions, stories they grew up with would get passed on orally to children before bedtime or during vacations. In an urban setup, where nuclear families reside in large numbers, the absence of these usual storytellers has prompted parents to look for alternatives. “There are two basic reasons parents opt for storytelling sessions. First is a functional reason. These story sessions are meant to keep the children engaged. The second reason is to make them learn. Parents want their children to learn and assimilate the traditional value system,” said Narayan Parasuram, the co-founder of Karadi Tales. Parasuram conducted an online storytelling session in association with Gurgaon Moms last week that was attended by close to 30 children. He shared the tale of “The Foolish Crow”. The publishing house says that it has seen a spike in its storytelling sessions and has been conducting them on a daily basis since the lockdown began. These sessions conducted by celebrities, authors and illustrators come under its new segment called “Katha with Karadi”. These sessions are also seeing a renewed push for introducing regional folklore, Indian fables and contemporary stories to children. Prakash adds children these days are exposed to a wide number of gadgets where they get exposed to modern and international stories. However, amid those, stories that used to be narrated by grandmothers are easily getting lost. “Through our sessions, we are trying to get children accustomed to stories that are based on or rooted in our Indian culture,” said Prachi Gambhir Dutta, founder of Kal-Aakaar Collective Trust, that hosts prop-based story dramas for children on its YouTube channel, BeeMee. One of the latest videos published by the collective is the adventure of four frogs who ventured out to see what lies at the end of a rainbow. “The Four Frog song that we shared is actually a very old Haryanvi poem that my aunt taught us when we were very small. I have been listening to it and it stayed with me. It was only last year that I converted it to a Hindi-English song for children,” said Dutta.Experts agree that most often, the push by parents and school for stories in English means that regional tales get sidelined. These sessions often use regional terms for animals like kauwa (crow) and mendak (frog). Bilingual narratives, they agree, are faring relatively well in outreach as it connects better with children.“We need to attempt storytelling in such a way and in such language that it becomes universally acceptable by children. With a bilingual approach, we are trying to reach out to a larger audience because at the end of the day English is also a foreign language that we have to learn. Bilingual songs and stories help a child relate to the story and connect with it better,” added Dutta. The sessions also offer additive engagement activities, such as creating your own props, puppet-making, enactment of storylines, singalongs and others. However, these sessions are not just restricted to children. Adults too are attending storytelling sessions, seeing them as a chance to break away from usual entertainment. These sessions stay away from fables, folklores and preachy tales but base their stories on real-life situations. Monika Agarwal is a soft skills expert, who is using storytelling sessions to share tales that suggest societal reconditioning. On Mother’s Day, Agarwal narrated the story of a modern working mother who had to go without breakfast but stopped short of telling her children “I am not hungry” when she noticed just two apples remaining in the fridge. “These stories are mostly around day-to-day situations. We need to show our children that we are also humans and that we also feel hungry so that they are not conditioned into thinking that mothers can be taken for granted. I want to free our minds from ideas that are no longer relevant to the current world,” said Agarwal, a resident of Sector 49.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/children-connect-with-their-roots-through-online-storytelling-sessions/story-AcClqfuVjQczxN8kEnIfiK.html
16-05-2020||City||Wildbuzz: Bearing a tooth ache||Having rescued over 600 Sloth bears from the barbaric ‘dancing bear’ practice, the NGO, Wildlife SOS, found them unfit for release into the wilderness as they had suffered mutilation, physical and psychological trauma, and chronic medical complications. Their delicate muzzle had been pierced by hot iron pokers and teeth forcibly removed. Dental infections, rotting teeth and mouth ulcerations were common among ‘dancing bears’. Dental pain, as those among us who suffer it can testify, is the emperor of common maladies as it festers among countless nerves and blood vessels.However, according to Kartick Satyanarayan, CEO, Wildlife SOS, “Veterinary dentistry is a specialisation badly needed in India as only a handful of specialists are working in this area.” Realising that dental surgery would lend a new life to suffering bears by effecting a remarkable change in their temperament and making them healthier and more active, the NGO went the extra mile by having their veterinarians trained by UK experts.That expertise transformed the lives of the bears retained at the NGO’s rescue centres as they undergo regular dental procedures such as root canal treatment in cases of minimal damage, tooth extraction in cases of irreversible damage such as infected abscesses, and dental scaling to clean tartar build-up. Geriatric bears (older than 15 years) undergo regular dental scaling as neglect can lead to long-term damage to enamel and gums, making it very difficult for older bears to consume food.“Recently, a bear named Durga upon receiving a root canal treatment showed improvement fairly quickly. Evidently no longer in pain, Durga is much more energetic and is back to munching on watermelons and dates!” Wildlife SOS spokesperson Arinita Sandilya told this writer.SUNFLOWERS ON A MOTHY NIGHTIf butterflies are unchained flowers of our sunny gardens, moths are their mysterious counterparts designed to haunt the dark. On a sunflower at about 8pm in our Chandigarh garden, I observed a moth whose wings seemed touched by the lightness of lilac, evoking comparison to clouds doused in the goodbye glows of sunset. It was as if this beautiful creature had flown to the clouds in twilight and embraced that colour before taking wing on earth below to feed on sunflower nectar when the sun was no longer around.I sought the expertise of the Hong Kong-based Dr Roger Kendrick, who is regarded as an authority on Asian moths, and Prof Jagbir Singh Kirti, head of zoology department, Punjabi University, Patiala. They were kind enough to identify this mostly unseen creature of Chandigarh as a species named, Thysanoplusia orichalcea, and distinguished it from the closely related and similar looking species, Thysanoplusia intermixta. Their expertise in distinguishing such cryptic species was revelatory!Prof Kirti recalls trapping this moth species in Chandigarh in 1979 while he was an MSc student at the Panjab University. Having worked extensively on moths across India, he discovered a 100 moth species and recently donated 10,000 specimens of his lifetime work to augment the collections of the Zoological Survey of India, Kolkata.Unlike bird species, which enjoy common Punjabi names, moths are little seen and thus are generically known as ‘Patangas’ in the vernacular. “While we know that honeybees are pollinators, moths perform the same task by sucking nectar from flowers and juice from fruits at night, thus gathering pollen and dispersing it. This moth species is commonly known in English as the Soyabean looper as it is regarded as a pest on that crop when it is a caterpillar feeding voraciously on Soyabean leaves. However, moths predate our crops in evolutionary history and were forced to shift to eating crops because humanity destroyed their natural habitats. So, they have suffered a negative connotation in popular consciousness for no fault of their own,” Prof Kirti told this writer. vjswild1@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/wildbuzz-bearing-a-tooth-ache/story-dfLH5rUEGCxv29BBm3VFZP.html

16-05-2020||Delhi||Parents allege GK school overcharging them, Delhi High Court asks for fee break-up||The Delhi High Court has directed KR Mangalam World School in Greater Kailash-2 to file an affidavit indicating the break-up of the amount mentioned under the head tuition fee in its current fee structure. The court passed the direction after a plea was filed by the parents association claiming that the school had been charging exorbitant amount of money despite the Delhi government asking schools not to charge anything beyond the tuition fee during the ongoing lockdown.Justice Jyoti Singh issued notices to the Delhi government and school authorities seeking their response on the plea and posted the matter for further hearing on May 26.The court was hearing a plea by the Parents Association of KR Mangalam World School, who had contended that in the garb of collecting tuition fee, the school was charging hefty fees. The counsel for the parents, advocate Gaurav Bahl, told the court that the school is not willing to give a detailed breakup of amounts mentioned in the fee bills sent to parents. He further submitted that compared to the tuition fee charged for the academic session 2018- 2019, the amount charged in the current bills was higher. Appearing for the school, its counsel Kamal Gupta opposed the arguments and submitted that the school is bound by the guidelines issued by the Delhi government and was following them meticulously and scrupulously. He submitted that the fee bill only reflects tuition fee, which was being charged.He also said that the Annual and the Development Charges, though mentioned in the fee bill, will not be charged, until further orders of the court.Advocate Gautam Narayan, additional standing counsel, said that due to the pandemic the government had issued circulars and made it clear to all the schools under its jurisdiction that any expenses/expenditures other than the tuition fee should not be charged by the school.Following this, the court sought the response of both the Delhi government and school.The school management did not comment despite repeated phone calls and text messages, but its counsel Kamal Gupta, said,“It is unfortunate that despite repeated directions by the court to pay the fees at current rates certain parents for their vested and oblique motives have chosen to defy orders and are holding on to about Rs 4 crore since the last one year. There are only 20 parents trying to mislead other parents, and are also taking association membership fees from them. The association is unregistered so as to save itself from any audit or law whereas the school’s accounts are audited every year.Gupta said that the school had implemented the Seventh Pay Commission recommendations but it was unable to make the new payment to teachers because of some parents.The directorate of education was unavailable for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/parents-allege-gk-school-overcharging-them-hc-asks-for-fee-break-up/story-uRplCeZOwKqDzTwGt0zYcI.html

Some locals had also stolen the liquor from the godown during the lockdown.In-charge of crime investigation agency of Panipat police, Deepak Kumar said, “Police will now have to investigate how Rana and Ishwar got the keys of the godown even when it was sealed by the excise and taxation department.” “We will take help from excise department to investigate the allegations. Notices will be served to the excise officials to join the investigation,” he added.The godown was sealed after excise and taxation department detected irregularities and fined co-owners Ishwar of Shamri village and Rana with Rs 2.22 crore. On April 28, police had registered an FIR against unknown persons on a complaint filed by assistant excise and taxation officer Rajesh Rohila for theft of around 4,700 liquor boxes from the godown.

Of the total, 20 are of the migrants who reached here from Delhi on a truck with 35 others on May 3. “But there’s no need to panic as all the 55 migrants who came on truck were quarantined on the day they reached here and hence there is no chance of the disease being spread to other places or localities,” Purnia DM Rahul Kumar said. “So far, 20 of them have tested positive and more test reports are awaited.”Purnia’s first Covid positive patient had also reached here on a truck carrying fruits from Azadpur in Delhi on April 27.“Almost all positive cases are related to migrants who have reached here surreptitiously,” additional chief medical officer (ACMO) of Purnia Dr S K Verma said. “The troubling part is that the migrants are still coming by hiring trucks and without going through a proper medical screening.” He expressed deep concern over those migrants who escaped medical screening and are staying in villages.Reports coming from various sources suggest that truck owners are collecting huge money by transporting the migrants to their destination. “We had to pay Rs 3,000 each to the truck driver to ferry us to our native block Rupauli in Purnia,” one of the migrants said.The astonishing part is that the trucks have been carrying migrants in the presence of police forces.Seemanchal comprising of four districts Purina, Katihar, Kishanganj and Araria has been a hub of migrants. There has been a sharp rise in number of patients with 58 cases reported so far, followed by Katihar (15), Kishanganj (12) and Araria (5).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/20-of-26-cases-in-purnia-are-migrant-workers-who-came-in-a-packed-truck/story-4OPKUpVpyE5LLkgU0yPmyO.html

16-05-2020||Patna||Beggars outside Gaya temple on the brink as their ‘bank’ goes bankrupt||A bank founded by beggars at Gaya for their rainy days has gone bankrupt, courtesy lockdown 3 , leaving them on the verge of starvation.Till lockdown 1 and 2, ‘Mangla Bank’, founded seven years back by about 50 beggars who sit outside the famous Maa Mangla Gauri temple, had a balance of Rs 1.20 lakh. “However, we could not sustain it further. During lockdown 3, all the money was distributed as loans to beggars for survival, as their earnings in the form of alms stopped when the Maa Mangla Gauri temple was shut down and the devotees stopped coming. There is no flow of cash or kind now,” says Chenari Paswan, 65, who is the manager of the Mangla Bank and has been begging at the place for about 40 years.Maa Mangla Gauri temple is situated on the top of Mangla Gauri hill. According to mythology, here Shakti is worshipped as a Goddess of benevolence and nourishment. The footfall of devotees is maximum on every Tuesday, besides the Durga Puja.Paswan rues that though they still sit at Mangla Gauri the whole day, they hardly get any alms. “On Saturday, a ‘babu’ came and gave us Rs 2,000, instructing to distribute 2 kg flour to each beggar, but this will hardly be enough for all. No official from the Gaya district administration has come to help us. Till now, we are surviving on small helps coming from some social workers or generous people,” he says.The Mangla Bank has a formal register where all the deposits and credits are jotted down. “When things were normal, every Tuesday, the beggar used to deposit Rs 50 with me. Every Saturday, the collected money was deposited in Madhya Bihar Gramin Bank, Maranpur branch. Besides this, the record is manually maintained by me in a register,” says Paswan.The cash, in the time of need, is withdrawn from Madhya Bihar Gramin Bank and given as loan to the beggars at 2% rate of interest. “The bank account is operated by joint signatures of three beggars, Malti Devi, Hiramati Devi and Nagina Devi. Nagina is the treasurer of the bank. I don’t have the authority to withdraw the money, which gives the rest of the members faith on me that fraud will not be committed with the collected money,” says Paswan, adding the interest collected from the beggars is deposited in the bank account.Nagina says members who ask money from the bank for drinking and gambling are discouraged. “Aggrieved, some have resigned from the membership of the bank. But as an informal institution, we have lent money for marrying daughters of the beggars, in time of medical emergencies or even for sponsoring studies to wards of the members,” she says.Paswan hoped the ‘normal’ days would return soon by the blessings of Maa Mangla Gauri, who has been helping them live in this world.Gaya’s deputy collector, Amrita, who is also in-charge of Covid-19 control room in the district, said the beggars would have to contact the control room through phone or visit the four disaster relief centres, where cooked food is served twice a day. “They can also get dry ration from the control room, as they might not be ration card holders, but the condition is that they have to get their names registered with us,” she said.

Hours later, the factory assured them payment of overtime, while district administration officials said the decision of April salary was still pending with the Supreme Court.Mukesh Malaudh, state chief of Zameen Prapti Sangharsh Committee (ZPSC), said the migrant workers were staying in miserable conditions and wanted to work in the factory instead of leaving for their homes.Despite repeated attempts, Indian Acrylics Limited officials could not be contacted. However, deputy superintendent of police (Rural) Satpal Sharma said the factory has started depositing payment of overtime done by the migrants in March and May.“The matter has been resolved. The decision of April month’s salary is still pending with the Supreme Court, but rest of the payment is being deposited in the workers’ accounts. However, those who wish to go home have been asked to submit their resignations or leave applications. The factory will be functional with 30% staff,” added DSP Sharma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/migrant-workers-take-out-protest-march-demanding-salaries-in-sangrur/story-q3tREEw0Khj6yvBU0kIJcK.html
16-05-2020||Patna||113 new cases push Bihar’s tally to 1,145, over 40% are migrants||Bihar reported 113 more Covid cases across 23 districts Saturday, pushing the state tally to 1,145, with seven deaths so far.This was the second highest spike in a day after May 12, when 130 cases were reported in state.Of these cases, six were reported from Patna, five of whom were police personnel of the Bihar Military Police (BMP-14). This had taken the tally of police personnel infected with the virus to 37, including 27 from the BMP and 10 others from the district police constabulary.The home-coming of the migrants had contributed to a spike in cases as around 44% of the state’s Covid cases were attributed to them, said health secretary Lokesh Kumar Singh.A total of 481 migrants of whom 423 had returned to the state after May 3, had so far tested positive for coronavirus, he added.Of the total 44,340 samples tested so far, nearly 2.44% were positive for Covid-19, said Singh. Meanwhile, state government Saturday clarified that migrants coming from outside by any means, will be eligible for government aid of ₹1,000 after completion of the mandatory 14-day institutional quarantine period.The government issued fresh directives Friday as the previous order was silent about migrant workers, who had reached the state by road, either by truck, bus, bicycle and even on foot. The earlier order had mentioned about migrants reaching the state by Shramik Special trains.In allowing financial assistance of ₹1,000 to all such individuals, the government had, however, put a rider that migrants, having their bank accounts, maintained in Bihar, would only be eligible to receive its largesse.This had raised political hackles with the Congress questioning the state government’s intention in paying the migrants, arguing that many of them would be deprived of the financial aid as they had their bank accounts at their place of employment.Kumar had earlier said that migrants returning to the state would be reimbursed ₹500 in addition to their train fare. A migrant worker would, however, get a minimum of ₹1,000 under the scheme if the amount taken together was less than ₹1,000, said Anupam Kumar, secretary, Information and public relations department.This amount was to be directly transferred into the bank account of the individual after completion of the quarantine period.As of Saturday, nearly 3 lakh migrants were staying at block quarantine camps, after 2,46,160 migrant workers had reached Bihar by 195 Shramik Special trains till May 14, as per data released by the IPRD. The migrants have been put into 14-day institutional quarantine at block-level centres, after which they will have to undergo seven-day home quarantine.Unlike students, who were allowed home quarantine after they returned back, the migrants were made to stay in institutional quarantine centres to contain the spread of the virus, said officials.As of Saturday, Munger reported 125 cases, followed by Patna (106), Rohtas (77), Nalanda (67), Buxar (59), Begusarai (54), Siwan, Khagaria (43 each), Madhubani (39), Nawada (35) Kaimur (33), Bhagalpur (37), Banka, Gopalganj (32 each), Bhojpur (30), Jehanabad, Purnea (27 each), West Champaran (25), Aurangabad (22), Sheikhpura (21), Muzaffarpur (20), Darbhanga, Madhepura, East Champaran (16 each), Kaitihar (17), Lakhisarai, Saharsa (13 each), Arwal, Samastipur, Kishanganj (12 each), Supaul, Vaishali (11 each), Saran, Jamui (10 each), Gaya (8 each), Sitamarhi (7), Araria, Sheohar (4 each) till the time of going to the press.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/113-new-cases-push-bihar-s-tally-to-1-145-over-40-are-migrants/story-8SOR455vpWJDvUERx6lPAJ.html

Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) has created a separate dashboard on its website to make the permission paperless. Last year, more than 800 trees fell during monsoon, killing two people. The pre-monsoon trimming is important to prevent such accidents.Those who wished to trim any tree on their premises or road had to submit an application in the TMC office. With the Covid-19 outbreak, TMC has decided to go paperless.Tree officer Kedar Patil said this was the first time permission will be given online.“We have uploaded the forms online which residents, housing societies and corporators can fill and submit if they want trees to be trimmed. An expert will survey the tree and give his feedback and approval online,” he said.Patil added, “Trimming will be carried out following social distance guidelines and workers will use masks and gloves. The trimmed branches will be transported to the Kopri green waste processing plant.”He said the garden department has also begun its survey of dangerous trees last week.In September, the Supreme Court had given directives to TMC to draft a policy for trimming and pruning of trees while hearing a petition filed by Thane-based activist. TMC had chalked out a policy on scientific trimming in November last year. The tree committee said trimming will be done out as per the norms of the policy.Vikrant Tawde, a tree committee member, said, “The permission will be given abiding by all the norms of the policy.”Residents can log on to the TMC website to apply for permission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/thane-residents-can-apply-online-for-tree-trimming-permission/story-kc1tDFu2DFrU2u1WtkOKWP.html

While those who do have homes in these cities or a place to stay, must stay back there.”Many migrants have been returning home to their native towns since the lockdown after their income became a serious problem. Currently, Kolhapur district has about 28 positive patients and has reported one death due to Covid-19. Out of these, nine have been discharged and only 18 active cases are undergoing treatment. Patil said, “I am not saying that they should not come, but if they have a place to stay back then they should only return if they have prior permission and only if they have medical emergencies or any unavoidable reason to come.”“We want to prevent the spread of the virus in the district which has comparatively less number of cases as compared to Mumbai and Pune which are prime red zones in the country,” he said.Patil also said that about 86,000 people have come to Kolhapur before the lockdown was officially announced and about 20,000 had come after the lockdown by seeking permission. “Only those who have permission must come so that we can arrange quarantine or isolation facilities for them accordingly,” said Patil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/take-prior-permission-before-retuning-to-kolhapur-patil/story-oomLlO7YhcOIO4xNwfI17M.html
16-05-2020||Chandigarh||It’s time to leave the past behind and move on in the new world||Theodore Roosevelt once said: There can be no life without change, and to be afraid of what is different or unfamiliar is to be afraid of life. These lines came to mind on hearing my 11-year-old grandson Aziz tell his mother with a faint starchiness in his voice: “I want change. I am getting bored. I know every day is a different day, but it is the same routine!”The young man’s words as he furiously worked on a Rubik’s cube to match colours on each side got me thinking. Is the curfew beginning to weigh on young minds? Think of the daily routine of children of his age, now confined indoors. Imagine the number of times they must be complaining of boredom; coaxing their parents to ‘play’ with them – chess, ludo, carrom! For them, options of indoor games are diminishing, getting exhausted. Frankly, parents lack a child’s perspective, perseverance, patience and stamina to agree to drop everything and start playing with them whenever asked to.WHEN CONCEPT OF CHANGE CHANGESChange is desired by everyone, be it a child or adult. It is even more relevant today when coronavirus has changed the very concept of change, life itself and its meaning. There is an essential difference in the times before the pandemic and now. This difference has left us shaken. Things are not the same in so many ways: Earlier, we were told to keep our distance from ‘negative’ people, now we are told to stay away from ‘positive’ people!Change, at first, is resisted, opposed. Today, we are on the cusp of an unexpected, unanticipated change. Let us accept this and move forward, adjusting our lifestyles and attitude to the new normal.Let us usher in the changes children desire and deserve.WHY CHILDREN NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE TRUTHThink out-of-the box. Explain to them that certain changes will never be undone; life will continue. The present is painful, but nothing hurts more than remaining stuck where we do not belong.Cut off from school, classmates and outdoor play, children are now given the liberty to spend more time before a screen –TV, Tab or smart phone. That’s not the real world and this liberty can get to be a liability for them.Any adversity makes us stronger to cope with stress, strain, worry, concerns. With everything disrupted: From lives to livelihoods, economies to commerce; social relations to social distancing; work to leisure, we have to start gearing up to face whatever comes our way – knowing at the same time that life will continue.Children will not understand this. Explain, tell them why we have to move on. CS Lewis once said: There are far better things ahead than any we leave behind.The present phase will teach us to balance jaan and jahan (life and world) as also to leave our past in the past - or let it destroy our future! Prepare children to change now in the fast changing world!(The writer is a veteran journalist and former Punjab information commissioner)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/it-s-time-to-leave-the-past-behind-and-move-on-in-the-new-world/story-FpS3s6j4hwKWpjqxImshyN.html

Stating that they receive most of their orders in the evening hours, restaurateurs say the administration must allow home delivery during evening hours.Currently, home deliveries are allowed between 7am to 7pm.As per the eatery owners, most residents are already apprehensive about ordering from outside due to fear of infection. “We get very few orders during the day as most residents are wary of the virus spread. Besides, the timings set by the administrations aren’t conducive. The few orders that we get are around lunch time,” says Parampal Singh, owner of Kays Lovely Food, Jamalpur. Bhupinder Singh, the owner of Ice Cream Parlour, Basant restaurant, and The Table restaurant, said, “These days due to the rising temperature, most residents don’t eat fast food during the day. Besides, they prefer having ice-cream post dinner, which is why the time slot of 7am to 7pm, does not work for us.”He added that due to the time restriction, they are not able to accept most of the orders. “The administration must allow home deliveries from 1pm to 11pm,” Bhupinder said, stating that in the past one week, sale of food and ice-cream in his eatery has been 15% of the normal. SHORTAGE OF DELIVERY BOYSWith large-scale migrant exodus, most restaurants are also facing shortage of manpower.Bhupinder says, “The online home delivery service company has reduced the salary of delivery boys due to which the number most of them are unwilling to continue. Due to this, there is a shortage of delivery boys and now delivery takes around an hour as compared to earlier when it took just about 20 minutes.”  Manjit Singh, president of the Ludhiana hotel and restaurant association, said that not all restaurants in city have opened as some of them don’t provide home delivery service and dining-in is not allowed yet. “Further, those who have started functioning are also not able to serve food during evening hours when the demand is more,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-restaurateurs-want-admn-to-allow-home-delivery-in-evening-hours/story-1HTFfesWvfeP8BwmIjTSmN.html

The matter had come to light after the victim delivered a stillborn baby at the civil hospital in Sector 6.“The accused confessed in his statement to the police that he used to force himself on his daughter mostly in an inebriated state. It was mostly in night hours when other family members were asleep,” said inspector Neha Chauhan, SHO, women police station, Sector 5. The SHO said as per the victim, the accused had been sexually abusing her for the past one year. But, she could not tell anyone due to fear.

The family lives in Abhaypur, Sector 19. The accused, who has two more daughters and as many sons, is a marketing executive at a kitchen appliance company.The SHO said he was sent to judicial remand for 14 days.

Why shouldn’t Chandigarh Club do the same?”Jain, an advocate at the Punjab and Haryana high court, added that he had sent a legal notice to the club management asking to waive the fee.Another member, Puneet Jain, who runs a hotel in Sector 35, said all clubs should waive membership fee during this period. “Even after the lockdown is opened, only home delivery will be started at first, which the club doesn’t do, so the management needs to reduce the fee till then.” Another member, Ajai Singh Takhar, a businessman, said the costs of electricity and water to run the club were not being incurred, so the club could manage their finances. “Even after paying a joining fee of ₹3.85 lakh, rather than enjoying the club experience, we feel like they are just after our money. We have written to the management about our complaints, but they don’t reply,” he said.‘NEED TO PAY SALARIES’Saying that membership fee had never been waived ever since the club was started in 1958, executive member Hitesh Puri said, “The fee is needed to pay the salaries of around 300 employees of the club and for other monthly expenses. All members are treated as shareholders of the club and have to step in for its functioning. About a third of the 7,000 members have already paid the fee online.”Club president Sandeep Sahni said, “Before we received the legal notice, nobody had complained about the fees. In so many years of functioning, nobody has had problems with subscription fee as it is needed to run the club. We will soon send a reply to the notice.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/covid-lockdown-chandigarh-club-members-see-red-over-subscription-fee-bill-for-april/story-lPvY04zsjD4vLlzc90k62K.html

The incident took place inside the compound of a the DTC bus terminal in Shahdara. The arrested man Nandlal alias Nandu, is a homeless who has been living around the bus terminal for the last nine years, said deputy commissioner of police (Shahdara) Amit Sharma. He said the police had received a call around 5pm on Friday that someone was assaulted with a blunt object at the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) bus terminal in Shahdara.“Our team reached there and found a man dead with a head injury. A DTC employee, who was an eye-witness, said in his statement that one homeless man, Nandu, hit the man and fled. A case was registered and multiple teams were formed to nab Nandu,” said the DCP.The dead man was identified as Shyam Pal, a rickshaw puller. After a two-hour-long search operation, one of the police teams caught Nandu from near the railway tracks, behind the vegetable market in Shahdara.During the interrogation, the DCP said, Nandu disclosed that he was wandering in the DTC bus terminal compound when he saw Shyam Pal washing his rickshaw and cleaning himself under the tap.“Nandu asked him not to use the water tap. The rickshaw puller scolded him and hurled abuses at him. This enraged Nandu. He picked up a cricket bat lying nearby and hit him on the head. The man collapsed after which Nandu fled with the bat. We have recovered the bat from him,” added DCP Sharma, quoting Nandu’s statement to the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/man-kills-rickshaw-puller-inside-bus-terminal-in-shahdara/story-C3zTQJ0KAneSBoH7PFM8NJ.html

16-05-2020||Mumbai||HC allows vehicular access to Matheran thrice a week for essential goods||The Bombay high court (HC) disposed of a petition seeking vehicular access to Matheran to supply essential goods to the Ecologically Sensitive Zone (ESZ) after the interim monitoring committee of the Ministry of Environment and Forest (MoEF) said the local civic body could use Bharat Stage-IV compliant vehicles to transport goods once a week. The court, while accepting the committee’s decision to use the railways to supply goods to the core area, said till the railway starts transporting goods, vehicular access would have to be provided thrice a week instead of one, which MoEF agreed to. A single bench of justice SJ Kathawalla, while hearing the petition filed by former Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) MLA Suresh Lad on Saturday through video conferencing, was informed by MoEF that the interim monitoring committee appointed on May 13 had considered the fact that the tourist season for Matheran from March to May was lost which resulted in genuine problems for the residents of the hill station. The committee under the chairmanship of Konkan division commissioner Shivaji Daund on Friday heard the issues raised by the petitioner and observed, “The peak tourism season of Matheran hill station (March to May) was lost due to lockdown since March 2020 and this has resulted into huge economic losses to the people of Matheran and reduced their paying capacity. Undoubtedly, the current pandemic situation arising out of Covid- 19 is unique and has increased hardships for people of Matheran.”The committee unanimously passed a decision to request railway authorities to operationalise the line from Dasturi Naka to Matheran station for transporting goods. The committee decided to send a proposal to the divisional railway manager of Central Railway for approving goods transport by attaching dedicated goods bogies. The minutes of the committee’s decision further said till the transportation of goods via railways does not commence, it would allow the Matheran municipal corporation to hire goods transport vehicles meeting environmental norms to ferry essential goods every Wednesday. The same would be applicable till September.Advocate Gaurav Parkar, representing the petitioner, objected to once a week vehicular access stating the needs of the residents would remain unfulfilled and urged that the frequency be increased. The court accepted the same and modified the monitoring committee’s decision to allow environment compliant vehicles ply thrice a week and disposed of the petition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-allows-vehicular-access-to-matheran-thrice-a-week-for-essential-goods/story-o23mGVvKPPMpheB8VaofGM.html

Your eyes spot the device in your neighbour’s hand, triggering off a cascade of thoughts. “What a wonderful phone! Perhaps, I should buy it too. Sadly, though, my pocket does not allow it, but then, the great online sale is about to begin, and that too with monthly installment (EMI) options”. So, either you end up buying the phone on EMI and jeopardising your bank balance or you get all frustrated and dissatisfied at the prospect of not being able to afford the phone.Often, family time in the evening is devoted to discussions around thoda hai thode ki zaroorat hai (have little, want little) and ends up with zindagi isi liye yahan jhand hai (that’s why life is such a hit).At bedtime, only a few lucky ones get to sleep in the blink of an eye. The majority need mobile phones as lullaby and social media as a soothing thapki (caress). Then there are some helpless creatures, who, in spite of all efforts, keep tossing and turning in their beds only to get up more exhausted the next day.One wonders how it was when our grandparents were young and able to welcome each day with a smile and sleep peacefully at night. The sky was their mobile phone screen, the humming of mosquitoes their lullaby, their own thoughts lulling them to sleep, as gentle as a mother’s touch. Daily visits to the temple, feeding beggars and stray animals were musts. They also had little, but still thought the world was khoobsurat (beautiful.) The only means of transport then was a bicycle or a gyarah (eleven) number bus. They lived in an age when life was tougher than it is today.SECRETS OF BEING CONTENTEDSo what made them happy and contented? Was it stargazing? Was it riding the bicycle? I think it was a combination of all their activities. For our ancestors it was a part of their lives, done automatically. For us, it can be a change we can adapt, mindfully, on the chessboard of our lives.In those good old days when there was little of electronic media, the stargazing helped our grandparents think about their life, daily routine, needs and wants, their shortcomings and ways to improve them.If we could take some time out each night to impartially judge ourselves, we could be better persons. Our lives are full of mosquitoes of ‘wants’ and problems, we can either crib and spend sleepless nights or sleep peacefully under a protective “net” of acceptance, acknowledging life as it is and not comparing it with others.Acceptance of our ‘life’s situation’ is the trump card in our battle of life. If taken in the right spirit it can make us winners and, if not, it could mean getting checkmated.OPENING THE HEARTIt is said that sharing what you have makes you free and opens your heart for love and compassion. Our elders practiced it by feeding beggars or stray animals; we could do the same by visiting and making donations for destitute homes. Such gestures make us appreciate what we have: A healthy, happy and wholesome life; something which we forget to acknowledge when we hanker after things we do not have.Walking or riding a bicycle was how our grandparents commuted, and it became their daily workout routine. Research has proved that physical activity or exercising releases ‘endorphins’ in the body that triggers positive feelings. So, why not exercise, run, walk or even dance to feel good?Our life is a chessboard on which we have the dark squares of problems and pains, as well as white squares of peace and pleasures. We must step on both the squares to move forward.Unlike the game of chess, however, we have enemies inside us as well asoutside, defeating the one inside will automatically disarm the other.Our grandparents won the game. Let us continue the legacy.(The author is a pharmacist.

16-05-2020||Patna||Bihar reports 46 new Coronavirus cases, state tally at 1,079||Forty-six more people have tested positive for Covid-19 in Bihar, taking the total number of cases in the state to 1,079, a senior health department official said here on Saturday. Principal Secretary (Health) Sanjay Kumar said these 46 samples tested positive for the virus on Friday. Among the fresh cases, five have been reported from Patna district where the tally has gone up to 105. While one is a 14-year-old girl from the rural Bakhtiyarpur area, the remaining four are male personnel of the Bihar Military Police’s 14th battalion, he said. The number of BMP-14 personnel, stationed at Khajpura locality in the city, who have been found infected till date has now reached 25. The chain of infection in the area began with a 32-year-old woman from Bijli Gali by-lane testing positive last month upon being admitted to AIIMS, Patna with breathing trouble. Within a few days, nearly 20 residents of the by-lane fell prey to the contagion which also spread to nearby localities like Raja Bazar and a slum located close to the Bihar Public Service Commission office on Bailey Road. At least five barracks of BMP-14, besides Bijli Gali, the slum close to BPSC and Machhli Gali by-lane in Raja Bazar have been declared as containment zones, Patna District Magistrate Kumar Ravi said, adding that the lockdown is being enforced in the strictest form in these localities. Seven more people tested positive for Covid-19 in Jamui district, which reported its first case on May 12 and now has altogether 10 patients, the principal secretary said. Eighteen more cases were reported from Banka district while 10 people tested positive for Covid-19 in Sheikhpura, three in Katihar and two in Aurangabad. A two-year-old boy tested positive for Covid-19 in Munger district which accounts for the maximum number of 123 confirmed cases. All the 38 districts in the state have been affected by the pandemic and those with a high incidence also include Rohtas (77), Kaimur (66) and Buxar (59). The number of cases in Bihar has risen sharply since the beginning of the month, mainly because of migrants returning to their native places in large numbers by special trains in addition to other modes of transport. According to the state health department, 427 migrants arriving since May 4 have tested positive for Covid-19. Most of them had come from Delhi (112), Gujarat (106) and Maharashtra (97). Close to three lakh migrants have returned to the state from other parts of the country in ‘Shramik Special’ trains while the total number, including those coming by buses, trucks, bicycles and on foot, is estimated to be in excess of a million. Till date, 44,398 samples have been tested in the state and efforts were on to enhance the testing capacity drastically to contain the infection. At present, testing of samples is held at four places in Patna and one each in Muzaffarpur, Darbhanga and Bhagalpur. The rate of testing was adversely affected because the testing facility at Bhagalpur ran short of cartridges on Friday, though the principal secretary said replenishment will be ensured at the earliest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/bihar-reports-46-new-coronavirus-cases-state-tally-at-1-079/story-4QOD1HV72zlBgH8b4bWHFJ.html

16-05-2020||City||Optimism makes the world go round||At a pre-lockdown get-together, a dear uncle asked me to share ideas on positive thinking. He might have found asking me worthwhile, since I have a background in psychology. However, positive thinking, in a nutshell, is actually nothing more than looking at a glass half full. But, when it comes to its real-life applications, we struggle, we stumble, and we strive. It seems to elude most of us. Or, so we think.The moment the lady of the house gets up at 6 am to prepare breakfast and tiffin boxes, she, without saying or realising so, is presuming it to be a normal day with her loved ones’ routines proceeding in a predictable manner. She is presuming structure and safety. Isn’t that positive thinking? And she has role(s) throughout these routines, that, she’ll be trying to do full justice to. That’s the application part.Doesn’t getting treated by an ophthalmologist for cataract after not being able to read a newspaper’s fine print translate to hope (and action taken) for regularity and continuity – something that’s indicative of optimism?Even when we admonish our younger ones for not studying: Doesn’t the energy we expend reflect the dreams and desires we harbour for our progeny?Life, with its daily mundane nature itself, is positive thinking.BEGINNING OF A JOURNEYYes, we do need to cultivate and train our minds further in this art, but that will remain only a remote possibility till this humdrum positive thinking is understood and assimilated. From there, the real journey will begin. And once that beginning is made, there’s no looking back.There can be multitude theories and techniques, both fancy and plain, for developing a positive mindset. Less of complaining. Yes! Gratitude journaling. Yes! Expecting good things. Yes! Yoga. Yes! Reframing challenges with terminology of opportunities. Yes!All the same, optimism doesn’t translate to being happy all the time. A positive thinker has a cent percent right to have bad days, low mood, and even irritability. But the conviction with which efforts will be put into overcoming these states of mind will make a difference. A Facebook post once read, “We think that the point is to pass the test or overcome the problem, but the truth is that things don’t really get solved. They come together and they fall apart. Then they come together again and fall apart again. It’s just like that, the healing comes from letting there be room for all this to happen; room for grief, for relief, for misery, for joy.” Never have words struck home more.TO BE RESILIENT, FLEXIBLEEspecially in these days of lockdown, it’s the hope of a return to normalcy that is sustaining us. We are all counting days as we lovingly allow the pet to lick our hands. We are anticipating a healthier environment once corona disappears, as we bask in the playfulness of the toddlers at home. We are helping loved ones kill monotony by performing a group-dance on old musical numbers within the family. We are displaying faith as we play antakshari to overcome drudgery. These times are also presenting chances to us for building resilience and flexibility. That is positive thinking.So, let’s breathe, and keep working to clear the roadblocks in the journey of life. But, let’s not forget to smile as we do this. Also, let us also keep attempting to put smiles on others’ faces. Borrowing a few lines from the Internet: “Chalo chupke se rakh aatey hain, khushhaali unke sirhaane mein, jinhein arsa beet gaya hai, khulkar muskuraaey huey (Come, let us quietly leave happiness/prosperity by their bedside – those who for ages have not smiled).”It is indeed in giving that we receive. So, let’s deliver an upbeat outlook.(The author is assistant professor (psychology) at Rajiv Gandhi Government College, Saha, Ambala)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/optimism-makes-the-world-go-round/story-dhIbshBhwDEVSm9dNdwzmK.html

The directions were issued in response to a public interest litigation (PIL) seeking appropriate measures to be put in place for the care and treatment of expecting women.The PIL was filed by advocate Mohiuddin Vaid after he came across a news report about a pregnant woman who was refused admission to four hospitals, including JJ Hospital, as she did not have a Covid negative report.On Friday, the division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice AA Sayed while hearing the PIL filed by Vaid through video conferencing, was informed of the news report wherein an expecting woman was refused admission to the hospitals and had to deliver her baby at home with the help of a midwife.In light of this submission, Vaid sought directions for appropriate measures to be put in place for expecting women to be attended to. However, state lawyer Jyoti Chavan opposed the allegation and said that no such incident was reported at JJ Hospital.Senior counsel Anil Sakhare for the BMC submitted that there were a number of maternity homes and clinics catering to the needs of expecting women and the woman could have availed their services. Sakhare sought time from the court to clarify the corporation’s position on the same.The court accepted Sakhare’s request and directed the civic body to file a response. “BMC should indicate the names and particulars of maternity homes and clinics which are attending to expecting women and the number of deliveries that have been conducted in such maternity homes and clinics over the past couple of weeks,” the bench said posting the next hearing for May 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/provide-list-of-maternity-homes-and-childbirths-therein-since-lockdown-hc-to-bmc/story-40aE3Ht57hxDCu2gKAHkBJ.html
16-05-2020||Kolkata||Bengal stocks masks, sanitizers at storm shelters as cyclone Amphan nears||The administration in Bengal has started stocking masks, sanitizers and soaps at all cyclone shelters in the coastal districts where thousands of villagers may have to be evacuated amid the Covid-19 pandemic as cyclone Amphan is expected to move towards the state’s coast.“This is for the first time that we are procuring such items – sanitizers and masks – keeping in mind the Covid-19 pandemic. These items would be stored in all the cyclone shelters to prevent any outbreak of the disease when villagers are evacuated before the cyclone and brought to these shelters,” said Subhomoy Bhattacharya, sub-divisional officer of Contai, a coastal area in East Midnapore district.According to the regional meteorological centre of the India Meteorological Department, the depression over Bay of Bengal is likely to intensify into cyclone Amphan over the next 12 hours. Then in another 24 hours it could intensify further into a severe cyclonic storm. It is likely to move towards West Bengal and adjoining coastal areas of Odisha between May 18 and May 20.Thousands of people from villages along the coast and low lying areas are evacuated during a cyclone and brought to cyclone shelters as part of disaster management protocol.“This time because of Covid-19 we also need to maintain social distance. For this we are increasing the number of shelters by roping in school buildings so that there is no crowding in one building,” said Dibyendu Sarkar, Block Development of Officer at Kakdwip in South 24 Parganas, which was hit by cyclone Bulbul in November 2019.In Contai sub-division of East Midnapore, which has a population of 16 lakhs, around 45,000 people had to be evacuated during Bulbul. In Kakdwip 64 school buildings have been identified over and above the 11 cyclone shelters. He said that apart from the food and drinking water that would be stored in the cyclone shelters and schools, soaps, sanitizers and masks are also being stored.“We have already procured 500-800 masks and more than 200 bottles of sanitizers. Masks will be given to those who don’t have one. Most people are now wearing masks and it has already been made mandatory by the government,” he added.West Bengal has three coastal districts – North 24 Parganas, South 24 Parganas and East Midnapore – which usually bear the brunt of cyclones. At around 11:30 am on Saturday the depression was located around 1,200 km south of the Bengal coastline. The state has already started moving in teams of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and the district administrations have been asked to stay alert and get prepared. Fishermen who have already ventured out have been asked to return as sea condition would get very rough.“We are expecting heavy to very heavy rainfall in some places with winds reaching up to 95 km per hour on May 20,” said a senior official Sanib Bandyopadhyay, deputy director general of meteorology at the regional meteorological centre in Kolkata.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/bengal-stocks-masks-sanitizers-at-storm-shelters-as-cyclone-amphan-nears/story-KLJYzZ527DTtqNn3YqO8GI.html

The government is procuring mustard (40 quintals maximum from a farmer in one go) at ₹4,425 per quintal minimum support price across 165 centres in the state. Mohit Kumar, a farmer from Dadri’s Jitpura village, said he had sold 32 quintals of mustard last week at ₹4,425 per quintal. However, the government has not transferred any money into his account so far.“I urgently need ₹30,000 to release payment for harvesting and threshing to labourers. The government’s claim of providing procurement amount within 72 hours has fallen flat,” Kumar said.Another farmer Gurmukh Singh of Bhiwani’s Garwa village said he is waiting for the payment for his mustard produce since April 29.“I visited the bank twice to ask whether the government has transferred the payment in my account. Amid the Coronavirus scare, we (farmers) are the only ones who sold their produce without taking any money in advance. Except us, everyone is selling their products by taking the money first. The government should release our payment at the earliest so that we can buy fertilisers for cotton crop,” Singh said.Arhitiyas worried over slow lifting of cropMeanwhile, the Arhitiyas in the state have alleged that the slow lifting of mustard and inadequate arrangements for the same has increased their worries.Sushil Kumar, a commission agent in Bhiwani’s Behal said they had loaded a truck with mustard on Tuesday and it is still standing outside a government godown, which is hardly 1.5km from the mandi.“Due to poor arrangements, the truck drivers have to wait in queue for four to five days for their turn to unload mustard crop at government godowns,” Kumar said.A market committee official, on condition of anonymity, said procurement agencies— the Haryana State Cooperative Supply and Marketing Federation Limited (HAFED) and Haryana State Warehousing Corporation (HSWC) have made payment to mustard growers who had sold their produce till April 28 and April 23 respectively.Bhiwani deputy commissioner Ajay Kumar said he has issued instructions to clear the payment of mustard procurement in the district. “I have discussed this issue with concerned officials, who assured me of sorting out payment of farmers at the earliest,” the DC said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mustard-growers-in-haryana-await-payment-for-procured-crop/story-AYucO7FKkIADxqRntzQ4DJ.html

We reject economic package announced by the Modi government which is a ‘jumla’. The debt of farmers should be waived off without any condition,” said Jagmohan Singh.“The prices of diesel should be reduced to Rs 22 per litre for farmers as has been done by the government for Air Turbine fuel,” he said.Singh said that the announced package of Rs 2 lakh crore loans for 2.5 crore farmers with 2% interest amounts to a relief of just Rs 4,000 crore and not the mega amount being projected. “Even then, it is not clear whether the interest subvention of 2% is over and above the 3% interest subvention already being given or shall be in place of that,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/farmers-observe-kisan-samman-diwas-reject-centre-s-economic-package/story-l9ychb9mX7jfWb8sX4y1jM.html

16-05-2020||Pune||Researchers at IISER, Pune design low-cost ventilator||Researchers of the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Pune (IISER), have developed a low-cost ventilator, which is a hybrid version of US and Italian ventilators for the ICU (intensive care unit).This will bridge the gap between the demand and supply during the ongoing Covid-19 (coronavirus) crisis to treat patients, say researchers.Umakant Rapol and Sunil Nair, both associate professors at IISER, have developed a low-cost ventilator which they have put together with readily available material. The researchers are now looking to get in touch with manufacturers to produce this model.“We started work on the project on April 2 and we finished it by April 20. After which we are working on the calibrating and packaging the device so that it can be in some presentable form,” said Rapol.“We have developed a hybrid version of both the designs which we were studying because of the unavailability of the components that were used in designing those two ventilators. So we came up with our own build of materials and designed the ventilator,” said Rapol.“One advantage of this device is one can monitor the ventilator, parameters of the patients remotely and also through a mobile phone,” said Rapol.The other members of the team consisted of technical officer Nilesh Dumbre, IISER Pune alumni Sainath Motlakunta, now a PhD student at Institute for Quantum Computing, Waterloo, Canada; and Mohammad Noaman, now a postdoctoral fellow at University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark.Nair said, “The genesis of the ventilator in IISER started when our international office got in touch with Umakant, and later me, to help in the design and development of a mechanical ventilator which is known as a ‘Bharucha ventilator’.”“While doing that we realised that was a very basic machine which would not suffice for the use of Covid-19 patients. At around the same time we got to know about a couple of open-source ventilators which had been released. One of them was called Mechanical Ventilator Milano (MVM) from Milan and the other one was an open-source ventilator from Florida. That got us thinking about how we could try and implement these ventilators in our context” said Nair.“It is simple, efficient as well as incorporates most of the design requirements from which ventilators who cater to Covid-19 patients have,” added Nair.“While we were navigating through the development of this project we got tremendous support from the institution in terms of funding which was needed and in terms of logistics needed,” added Rapol.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/researchers-at-iiser-pune-design-low-cost-ventilator/story-32KEvel8NdUZCmrKR1jxuN.html

16-05-2020||Lucknow||After Auraiya accident, Uttar Pradesh CM hauls up senior police officials, suspends SHOs||Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Saturday ordered the suspension of station house officers (SHOs) and sought an explanation from senior police officials in Agra and Mathura after 24 migrant labourers were killed in a road accident Auraiya.Adityanath announced an ex gratia of Rs 2 lakh each to families of the dead migrant workers and Rs 50,000 each for the seriously injured.The chief minister presided over a high-level meeting to review the action being taken in respect to the Auraiya road accident and said circle officers in charges of the two bordering police stations should be given a strict warning.He asked the additional director general of police (ADG) and Agra zone’s inspector general, along with four other top police officers including district police chiefs of Agra and Mathura, to explain the lapses.Cases should be registered against owners of the two trucks involved in the accident under relevant sections and the two vehicles should be seized, he said.Adityanath also urged the people not to travel by trucks or any unsafe vehicle. He said orders have been already issued to keep 200 buses at the disposal of district magistrates (DMs) of border districts. He said funds have also been provided to the DMs to send the migrant labourers back home and the government orders must be followed strictly.Several opposition leaders, including Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati and Congress’ Priyanka Gandhi Vadra questioned the government over the Auraiya accident.Mayawati pointed out that the chief minister had said officers will make arrangements for food, transit and shelter for labourers who come to UP or pass through the state. “It’s unfortunate that CM’s directions are not being taken seriously by officers because of which a big accident occurred in Auraiya,” the BSP chief was quoted as saying by ANI.“I demand the chief minister to take action against the officers who didn’t fulfil their responsibilities. Families of those who were killed or injured in this accident should be provided financial assistance. I express my condolences to the bereaved families,” she added.Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, the Congress general secretary, also lashed out at the government.“Auraiya’s heartbreaking incident has once again raised the question that why hasn’t the government made proper arrangements for workers to go home? Why aren’t buses being run to ferry the labourers in the state?” Priyanka Gandhi tweeted in Hindi.“Either the government does not see anything or is oblivious to everything. Is making statements the government’s only job?” she asked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/after-auraiya-accident-uttar-pradesh-cm-hauls-up-senior-police-officials-suspends-shos/story-kKyG6llA2oFUklRtShuO3I.html

The directions were issued after a public interest litigation (PIL) was filed seeking directions for appropriate measures to be put in place for pregnant women to be attended to. The PIL was filed by an advocate who came across a news report that an expecting woman was refused admission to JJ Hospital as she did not have a Covid-19 negative report. Three other hospitals, including a maternity home, also turned away the woman after which she had to deliver her child at home with the help of a midwife.The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice A A Sayed heard the PIL filed by Mohiuddin Vaid through video conferencing on Friday. The bench was informed of the news report.In light of this submission, Vaid who appeared in person sought directions for appropriate measures to be put in place for expecting women.State lawyer Jyoti Chavan opposed the allegation and said that no such incident was reported at JJ Hospital.Senior counsel Anil Sakhare for BMC submitted that there were a number of maternity homes and clinics catering to expecting women and they could avail their services. Sakhare sought time from the court to clarify the corporation’s position on the same.The court accepted Sakhare’s request and directed the civic body to file a response.“BMC should indicate the name and particulars of maternity homes and clinics which are attending to expecting ladies and the number of deliveries that have been conducted in such maternity homes and clinics over the past couple of weeks,” it said.The court also said that after going through the particulars furnished by BMC in its response, the PIL would be disposed of in the next hearing on May 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/provide-list-of-maternity-homes-number-of-deliveries-since-lockdown-bombay-high-court-to-bmc/story-kCGeSy3CGQmjW0soa2XOdP.html

16-05-2020||Lucknow||Allahabad HC suggests ways to check spread of COVID-19||Expressing displeasure over the condition of hospitals in Prayagraj, the Allahabad high court on Friday made some suggestions to the state government to check the spread of COVID-19 in the state and to provide necessary facilities to migrants entering into the state.The bench suggested that the state government must ensure that every migrant in the state is properly quarantined for at least 15 days and in the quarantine premises proper sanitization should be there along with food and medical facilities.On May 7, the high court had taken cognizance of a letter written by Gaurav Kumar Gaur an advocate, addressed to Chief Justice, raising the issue of death of Virendra Singh of Prayagraj who was corona positive and allegedly died due to laxity in treatment. The letter was treated as Public Interest Litigation (PIL) and the court had asked the state government to brief it about the condition of hospitals in the city.During the course of hearing, the bench comprising chief justice Govind Mathur and justice Siddhartha Varma asked the state government to rev up functioning of government hospitals and primary health centres in the city which are about 105 in number as such that they must be ready to treat from ‘minor flu and cold to heart attacks’.“This would minimize the requirement of private hospitals and would also ensure that public at large would get good treatment and at reasonable rates,” observed the bench. The bench questioned the conditions of quarantine centres and said, “What is the reason that despite various orders and directions of the state government to keep the Covid-19 virus hospitals clean and sanitized, they are neither cleaned nor sanitized.”The court has also suggested that list of migrant workers who are entering in state after lockdown must be maintained. Further, responsibility of government officers must be fixed to keep track of their health, availability of foods and other basic necessities to such migrants.The court further suggested that the state government must publicize contact numbers on which any resident of the state may inform, if he sees any person unknown to him/her is residing in their neighbourhood but not being tracked by the government.The court has fixed May 18 as next date of hearing and asked the state government counsel to apprise it with steps taken with regards to suggestions made.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/allahabad-hc-suggests-ways-to-check-spread-of-covid-19/story-RH2M8eE8oBvaWAauI2EeCK.html

Cartons with pamphlets of guidelines were fixed on the carts of vegetable vendors which they will carry with them and request people to read it in different localities they visit.“As vegetable vendors roam around in different localities where they come in contact with large number of people every day, they were exposed to threat of Covid-19. If anyone of them becomes infected, they may pose a risk to not only their kin but also to many others as well,” Singh shared.In a bid to control the spread of coronavirus, vendors were given proper instructions and tips to remain safe during work and maintain proper distance with people, he added.Besides vegetable kiosks, guideline posters have been put up in all localities of old city area to raise awareness among the people.

This ashram was their home for the past 55 days.Mahant Ram Sundar Saran, head of the ashram and others bid them farewell.“They became our responsibility. It was our duty to look after them. It was an emotional moment for all of us when they left. For the past two months we looked after them like our own family. All efforts were made to make their stay in the ashram comfortable,” said the Mahant. This was Narasimhappa’s third trip to Ayodhya. On the first two occasions he came alone. But on this third pilgrimage there were 13 others with him. They reached Ayodhya on March 21 with a return ticket for March 25. But the Covid-19 pandemic and the ensuing lockdown from March 25 left them stranded in Ayodhya.“The day lockdown was announced (March 24), we decided to leave the hotel and take refuge in the ashram (Hanumant Sia Raghunath Sadan). There was no option. It was a 21-day lockdown,” said Narasimhappa.“We were worried how we would sustain for 21 days in Ayodhya with a limited budget. What would happen next, how would we reach Bengaluru and what if we run out of money?,” said Narasimhappa. And then, Ram Sundar Saran, his deputy Nityanand Saran and other members of the ashram took it upon themselves to take care of this 14 –member group, including four men, nine women and an eight-year-old child.“We hoped that after April 17 we would be able to leave for Bengaluru. But as the lockdown was extended on three successive occasions, depression gripped all of us,” said Narasimhappa.With bare knowledge of Hindi language, interacting with the ashram staff and other locals was also a problem for this group.But as the locals came to know about these south Indians stranded in the ashram, aid started arriving for them. The district administration of Ayodhya also extended all support to them.Mamta Shastri of Darshan Bhavan ashram also helped the group.Janardan Tewari, another local of Ayodhya was instrumental in getting train tickets booked for them and arranging their road-journey to Jhansi.Things became easy for these pilgrims after they met Kamla Kant Sundaram, a south Indian living in Ayodhya Sundarm’s family has been living in Ayodhya for the past three generations.“The ashram also made available to us its kitchen to prepare south Indian food. The ashram and locals provided essential food grain,” said Paravathamma, a woman member of the group. Overwhelmed by the hospitality, Narasimhappa and the others promised to return after the pandemic subsided.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/south-indian-group-stuck-in-ayodhya-leaves-for-home-town/story-7S9y0CxiQrgiXtkrPTT3mL.html

The region is famous for pea cultivation and now the farmers have started growing the spatula-shaped mushrooms to supplement their income, says Kalzag Ladde of Chichim village in Spiti. The mushrooms were first cultivated in 2015 and now the activity is being supported by the horticulture department. 50 FARMERS TRAINED SO FAR Specialists are apprising farmers of the technique to grow mushrooms. Ladde produces approximately 150 kg oyster mushroom and supplies them to local hoteliers and Home Stays in Kaza for Rs 250- Rs 300 per kg.So far, 50 farmers have been trained in mushroom cultivation. They have also been provided with bags of mushroom spawn, which are to be incubated at room temperature.The mushrooms can be used in pickles, powder and medicines. Their cultivation has also provided women with a direct source of employment.HIGHLY NUTRITIOUSThe oyster mushroom is ideal for producing protein-rich food from agro-waste without composting. The mushrooms are rich in Vitamins C and B complex, and their protein content varies between 1.6% and 2.5%. It has most mineral salts required by humans such as potassium, sodium, phosphorus, iron and calcium.It also has antibiotic properties and reduces the bad cholesterol. They can be safely consumed by diabetics too. GROWN IN SUB-TROPICAL MOUNTANIOUS REGIONS The oyster mushroom is grown in subtropical mountain regions with temperatures ranging from 10°C to 24°C and relative humidity between 55-75% for a period of six to eight months.Clean paddy straw is soaked in water for 18 hours and mixed with a bottle of master spawn and horsegram powder. The mixture is filled into polyethylene bags and kept at room temperature. The compact mass is watered regularly until the mushrooms start growing.Spiti, the abode of Buddhist monks, and a popular tourists destination, is known all over the globe for its age-old Buddhists monasteries, scenic splendour and snow covered peaks, and it is now ready to make its mark in production and export of oyster mushrooms to other parts of the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/oyster-mushrooms-to-give-a-fillip-to-lahaul-spiti-economy/story-9jDC9ymc06CDgWSTCnc2vI.html

My condolences to the bereaved families of the dead,” Adityanath tweeted. जनपद औरैया में सड़क दुर्घटना में प्रवासी कामगारों/श्रमिकों की मृत्यु दुर्भाग्यपूर्ण एवं दुःखद है, मेरी संवेदनाएं मृतकों के शोक संतप्त परिजनों के साथ हैं। पीड़ितों को हर संभव राहत प्रदान करने,घायलों का समुचित उपचार कराने व दुर्घटना की त्वरित जांच करवाने के निर्देश भी दिए गए हैं।“Instructions have also been given to provide all possible relief to the victims, to provide proper treatment to the injured and to promptly investigate the accident,” he added.Jai Narain Singh, additional director general (ADG) of police (Kanpur Zone), confirmed that the accident took place when the truck trolley stopped at a roadside eatery around 3.15am.Singh said the truck trolley was carrying migrant labourers from Jaipur and Bharatpur districts of Rajasthan and most of them from UP’s Kushinagar, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal.The senior police official said the mini-truck was ferrying the labourers from Delhi and was heading towards Sagar in Madhya Pradesh while crossing over borders through Auraiya district. He said the mini truck’s driver apparently fell asleep and failed to spot the truck trolley. “The truck collided with the trolley from behind and climbed over it as the speed was high. All the 42 labourers sitting on the trolley were injured and 24 of them died before reaching the hospital,” Singh said while speaking over the phone. He said he along with other officials have reached Auraiya and arranging all possible relief for the injured people. Bodies of the labourers have been sent for post-mortem examination and efforts are on to contact their family members.Tens of thousands of people have been walking home from big cities after being laid off because of the lockdown to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) since late March.Millions of workers were left without work across cities and towns in India when the lockdown was announced on March 24, resulting in the first wave of workers going back to their villages. Every phase of the extension has seen a new wave—the lockdown was extended twice, from April 14 to May 3 and then May 3 to May 17.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/24-migrants-killed-in-road-accident-in-uttar-pradesh-s-auraiya-cm-adityanath-orders-probe/story-s8xCkS8smfVHdzgYw6Ng5L.html
16-05-2020||Lucknow||‘Took loan and went to earn, had to take loan to return’||Ranjit Kumar, 26, of Lakhimpur Kheri’s Chakdaha village had borrowed Rs 20,000 to go to Mumbai in November 2018. He had hoped to find employment there.Now, after the lockdown consumed jobs and Mumbai reported high number of coronavirus positive patients, Kumar like many other migrant labourers, was forced to return home. “I had taken a loan to go to Mumbai. All that I had earned has been exhausted and now I am in debt,” said Kumar, with a sloppy mask on his face and tears in his eyes.Several migrant workers now returning to their villages had similar stories to tell. Many of them were seen walking briskly to their villages. “We learnt there are orders not to allow us on roads and railway tracks and if found walking we could be quarantined away from our villages,” said one of them.Several migrant workers, mostly from Mumbai, were seen walking on Lucknow’s Shaheed Path on way to their villages. The vehicles they took to reach Lucknow left them on the highway during the night from where most of them had to walk their way home. Most of them had exhausted whatever little money was left with them to have food. They said they were jobless for last 50 days. “When our savings were almost exhausted, people said that we should return to our villages. Some left on foot though we managed to hire a truck,” said Dilip Kumar, of Mangrola in Pratapgarh, who had gone to Mumbai to earn livelihood in November, 2018.Migrant workers said they spent anywhere between Rs 2000 and Rs 3000 to get a cycle to ride their way back. A truck ride cost some of them between Rs 3500 to Rs 4000. “Trucker asked for Rs 4000 but we bargained for Rs. 3500. We were dropped outside Lucknow. There was hardly any space inside the truck which had about 40-45 people,” said Pradeep Raj of Sultanpur, who worked in a construction firm in Mumbai’s Parel area for 15 years. Between 11 pm and 1 am, nearly 200 migrant labourers arrived by trucks bearing Maharashtra registration numbers. They were from different parts of UP. Some of them headed to Prayagraj, others left for Pratapgarh, Lakhimpur Kheri, Sultanpur, Gorakhpur, Barabanki and Sitapur.“We are not touching anyone, we are also wearing masks. We have reached here from Mumbai and all our savings are exhausted,” said Rajender Singh who was headed to Garwarabazar in Pratapgarh.A woman was seen riding pillion on a motorcycle, holding her baby tightly to herself. She had been travelling for nearly 6 days on way to Gorakhpur. The motorcycle was driven by her husband Dilip Singh. “There was no one to guide us so we chose to go home by road,” Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/took-loan-and-went-to-earn-had-to-take-loan-to-return/story-RLIy9dRF2b8C3biNGaJsHI.html

16-05-2020||Chandigarh||NIA files chargesheet against 6 in killing of J&K BJP leader, brother||The National Investigation Agency on Friday filed a chargesheet against six people, including three slain Hizbul Mujahideen (HM) terrorists and three arrested overground workers of the terror group for providing support to Pakistan-based terrorists to kill BJP leader Anil Parihar and his brother Ajeet Parihar in Jammu’s Kishtwar.The chargesheet has been filed in the special NIA Court, Jammu against the six accused under Sections 302, 120B, 109 and 34 of the Ranbir Penal Code, Sections 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 38, 39 and 40 of the UA(P) Act and Section 25(1A) and 25 of the Arms Act.The Parihar brothers were shot at point-blank range outside their house on November 1, 2018, when they were returning home after closing their shop.Initially, a case was registered by the Jammu Police at Kishtwar. The case was subsequently taken over by NIA.During the investigation, accused Nisar Ahmed Sheikh, Nishad Ahmed Butt and Azad Hussain Bagwan, all residents of Kishtwar were arrested in November 2019.These three accused had provided logistic support to the three terrorists—Osama-bin-Javid, Haroon Abbas Wani and Zahid Hussain, who had killed the Parihar brothers.The investigation unearthed the larger conspiracy of these terrorists and the overground workers of Hizb who were attempting to revive terrorism in the Doda region.These terrorists not only carried out the murder of Parihar brothers but also carried out three other terrorist acts in Kishtwar in 2019.In furtherance of the said conspiracy led by Jahangir Saroori, commander of the terror outfit in Kishtwar district, the accused persons devised ways and means to raise funds to sustain the activities of the banned terrorist organisation.It may be stated here that Osama-bin-Javid, Haroon Abbas Wani and Zahid Hussain were killed during different encounters that took place between the Hizbul Mujahideen cadres and security forces in Ramban and Doda districts in September 2019 and January this year.Further investigation continues against absconding accused Jahangir Saroori and others involved in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/nia-files-chargesheet-against-6-in-killing-of-j-k-bjp-leader-brother/story-F7B1x8Ag9f8E8j6O3SlbbJ.html
16-05-2020||Jaipur||Walking back home from Rajasthan, migrant workers find shelter in schools||Sitting under a tamarind tree in Government Girls Secondary School in Kanota on the outskirts of Jaipur, Mohd Azad Tyagi and his family are clueless about their journey ahead. Five of them began walking from their rented house in Jaipur’s Jalupura area on Friday morning for their native village in Uttar Pradesh’s Muzaffarnagar district. There’s a three-month-old infant also with the family. Around noon, when they reached Kanota, police directed them to the shelter house in a government school.“I have been jobless for four months,” said 37-year-old Tyagi. “My wife was in hospital for delivery in March. Our new born daughter has congenital defect in heart. I have been busy taking her to hospital for treatment. After the lockdown, the shop where I worked to repair mobile phones has been shut. I burrowed Rs 3,000 to pay the rent. We thought there was no point staying in Jaipur anymore,” he added.There was another reason for Tyagi and his family to return to their village. The Jalupura neighbourhood in Rajasthan’s capital city where they were living is a densely-populated area. “I feared for my new born daughter. If we had continued living there, she may have gotten infected,” he said.Tyagi’s family is one of the 218 families camping at the school in Kanota. All across India, thousands of migrant workers along with their families have been walking home from cities and urban centres during the lockdown to curb the spread of Covid-19.On Thursday, the Rajasthan government instructed all district collectors to set up camps with essential facilities such as food, water and toilet for people walking on highways. “If workers are found walking on roads, they should be sent to the nearest camps through buses,” said Subodh Agarwal, who heads the state level committee for interstate migration, in the government order. The order said collectors should organise roadways buses to take these people to the state’s border. On Friday morning, many people were still seen walking on the Jaipur-Agra national highway. But they were stopped at a police check post at Kanota and directed to two camps set up in government schools.Ajaz Ahmad of Bahraich district in Uttar Pradesh is also among the migrant workers taking shelter in one of the schools. He worked as a welder at a government bridge near Jaipur’s Sikar Road intersection. Though he registered himself on the e-mitra portal - the government facility for permission for interstate travels - on May 2, but didn’t get any reply. “We began walking at 4am this morning. First we went to the Sindhi Camp bus stand hoping to catch a bus but were turned away. We were walking when police told us to come to this camp,” he said.By 2pm, Jaipur district administration had marshalled five roadways buses to ferry 195 people to two camps in Rajasthan’s border town of Bharatpur, said Jaipur divisional commissioner KC Verma in a government release.But the bus journey is momentary relief – many of them were stopped at the border in Bharatpur.“Bharatpur district administration has told us that their camps are full. They can’t take more people. Until this is resolved, we have stopped the buses at Dausa-Bharatpur border,” said Bassi tehsildar Premraj Meena, who is coordinating travels from Kanota. “Around 50 families have assembled at the camp again. We will send them as and when the buses are available to us. In the meantime, we have made all arrangements for them,” Meena said. Tyagi’s family got into a bus and reached Dausa-Bharatpur border but is now stuck there. “They should provide bus to our home towns. This is hardly any help – picking us from one point and abandoning at the other,” he said on telephone.Meanwhile, 74 families of Uttarakhand boarded a special train to Haridwar from Jaipur railway station on Friday evening. “We screened them at the check post in front of Kanota police station before sending them to the railway station,” the tehsildar said.The divisional commissioner said the train to Haridwar carried 1,300 passengers. Another train left Jaipur for Saharanpur at 9pm, he said in the release.According to the government, more than nine million people have registered themselves for permission to leave Rajasthan. Registration is also required to travel in buses arranged by government and in special trains.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/walking-back-home-from-rajasthan-migrant-workers-find-shelter-in-schools/story-DUEIpORrVuHqyihvSCbv9N.html

16-05-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana miffed over migrants’ entry into state from Punjab||Ajay, 22, worked in a stitching factory in Ludhiana and is now cycling to his native place in Uttar Pradesh’s Gonda, 980km away. Accompanied by an 18-year-old co-villager, Ajay had to cross Ghaggar river in a bid to avoid police while crossing the Haryana-Punjab border.“My wife was expecting to deliver a baby in the first week of May at my native place and I decided to reach there. I approached a local policeman for help and he asked us to bring luggage. At a stadium in Ludhiana, we waited for hours, only to be lathi-charged later,” he said. “Then I started cycling and we weren’t stopped anywhere till the Shambhu border on Ambala side. Punjab Police used to show us inner countryside routes. Locals told us to swim across the river to enter Ambala. In two rounds, I carried my luggage and cycle on my head, one by one in water level under my chest and crossed it,” he said. Ambala is the gateway to enter Haryana from the north where hundreds of migrants are leaving daily. Last week, the influx of the migrants grew to such an extent that Ambala City MLA Aseem Goyal, along with senior police officials, had to reach the border to discuss the issue with Punjab Police and facilitate their return.A police officer had then on record said that some of the migrants have been sent back via the field route they had entered Haryana from.Nine busses carrying nearly 230 migrants from various districts in Punjab were sent to Saharanpur from Saini Dharamshala on Thursday morning. SP Abhishek Jorwal said, “Punjab must have to stop them and send them home from their working place. Due to this, our shelter homes are getting full but we are sending buses regularly for UP and have sent three trains in a week for Bihar. We must ask how many buses were deployed from Patiala or Ludhiana to ferry them.”National Highway-44 in Ambala is full of migrants walking, cycling, resting, many in queues for food opposite the cantonment railway station. Haryana home minister Anil Vij said, “Punjab government is behaving irresponsibly. They should stop pushing migrants working in their state into Haryana. Many who have already entered are being kept at shelter homes and are consecutively sent to their native places by buses or trains.”“Haryana DGP has told his Punjab counterpart many times to stop this. During the curfew, if they are walking towards Haryana, this is not possible without the help of the local police,” Vij, who is also an MLA from Ambala Cantonment, said.Punjab DGP Dinkar Gupta was not available for a comment. However, an official spokesperson of the police department said the state force has not received any complaint from Haryana about migrants from Punjab illegally entering Haryana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-miffed-over-migrants-entry-into-state-from-punjab/story-H0BWH3tOC8v0SfXf3nWruI.html

One of them is a 59-year-old male resident of Sector 21. He is the father of a medicine specialist working at the Panchkula civil hospital in Sector 6. The other patient is a 60-year-old woman from Sector 10. Panchkula civil surgeon Dr Jasjeet Kaur said the surveillance teams on the ground had isolated the immediate family members of both patients. The affected area in both these sectors had been declared containment zone to stop the spread of the virus. Further contact tracing of these patients was underway, she added.SOURCE OF INFECTION UNKNOWNThe health authorities have not established the source of infection in both cases. The Sector 21 man and his wife had visited the Panchkula civil hospital for a regular check-up and had been sampled for Covid-19. While his wife’s report is negative, the man was found positive. Sources said the man’s son, was on Covid duty at the hospital, and had been isolated, along with his wife. The Sector 10 woman, a cancer patient, had to undergo chemotherapy at a private hospital. Her sample was collected before the therapy and she was found infected. Dr Kaur said the woman had visited a hospital in Mohali as well. “We are trying to find her entire contact history. Five of her family members have been isolated for sampling,” she said. Of the total 25 Covid patients in Panchkula, 19 have been discharged, leaving six active cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cancer-patient-govt-doctor-s-father-found-positive-in-panchkula/story-55fcGkv1DNxZg8zd6BeMVM.html
16-05-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana Roadways receives lukewarm response on service resumption||Haryana Roadways received lukewarm public response on the resumption of bus services on Friday.The services were closed since chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar had announced lockdown in view of the coronavirus pandemic on March 23.On Day 1, buses from eight depots operated to and fro on several routes with 196 passengers, earning a total revenue of ₹42,580 to the roadways. As per the data provided by the directorate of state transport, government of Haryana, seven buses that hit the roads were from Panchkula, the largest number among all the depots. Almost 35% of the passengers (68) that travelled from various districts in the public carrier were from Panchkula depot itself.Further, only one passenger travelled between Panchkula and Karnal in the morning, while a maximum of 20 passengers took the journey from Narnaul to Rewari late afternoon.29 ROUTES DESIGNATEDAs many as 29 routes were designated for the resumption of the bus service, but nine of them were suspended in absence of bookings.A Kaithal-bound passenger was stuck in Ambala due to the unannounced cancellation of the bus service. Sanjeev, an assistant professor, travelled from Nawanshahr (SBS Nagar) in Punjab to Ambala Cantonment (Haryana) to board a bus for his home, but was stranded due to the suspension of the service. “I travelled with a friend on a two-wheeler early morning with a curfew pass and the ticket that I had booked online. On reaching Ambala Cantonment bus stand, I came to know that I was the only passenger travelling to Kaithal and this was the reason they suspended the bus service. I didn’t receive any cancellation message and now, I’m stuck here,” he said. The guidelines issued on Thursday said that only passengers with online tickets would be allowed to board the buses and no window tickets would be sold.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-roadways-receives-lukewarm-response-on-service-resumption/story-hZ3NoTIMiM5NQ4kRed0QjO.html
16-05-2020||Chandigarh||4 out of 6 containment zones in Chandigarh account for just 4% of total cases||Four of the six containment zones sealed by the UT administration account for just 4.1% of the total Covid positive cases. The six areas include the Kacchi Colony in Dhanas, part of Sector 52, Shastri Nagar in Manimajra and parts of Sectors 38 and 30B, and the congested Bapu Dham Colony.Out of the total 191 positive cases, only eight were reported from four of these containment zones—Sector 52 reported three cases, and one case each was reported from Sector 38, Dhanas and Manimajra. On the other hand, the other two containment zones—Sector 30B and Bapu Dham Colony—account for 74.3% of the total cases recorded in the city.There is no active case in Sector 38, and only 11 persons in Sector 30 of the total 21 infected are still hospitalised at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research.THE BAPU DHAM MYSTERYAt Bapu Dham Colony, three persons have been discharged, with one dead and 122 infected. The source of the spread is still a mystery as reports have suggested only five to ten persons attended the ‘small gathering’ organised by Patient 1. Earlier the UT administration had claimed that more than 100 people had attended the gathering.Other reasons include common community taps, and sharing of hookahs, cigarettes and bidis, and community drinking and card playing sessions during lockdown.THE BALANCING ACTDr Sonu Goel, community health expert at PGIMER, said that it was a balancing act. “To keep certain areas shut and sealed and keep few zones open is an ideal situation which helps in containing the infection and also reopens the economy.”HOW AREAS WILL REOPENUT health secretary Arun Gupta said as per the central government guidelines, the restrictions in containment zones will be lifted only after 28 days when the last positive case of the zone gets discharged.When asked why areas with the remaining 20% cases had not been sealed, Gupta said areas like Sectors 15 and 40 were congested and thus more vulnerable, and all these factors were important in decision making about sealing an area.2 SCHOOLS IN BAPU DHAM TURN INTO QUARANTINE FACILITYIn order to break the chain of infection in Bapu Dham, the UT administration on Friday turned two school buildings here into a special quarantine facility. UT administrator VP Singh Badnore said during the Friday review meeting that those Colony residents whose houses were small and congested should be allowed to utilise this facility free of cost.While Badnore appreciated PGIMER for their field visit to the Colony, doctors privy to the matter said the overall analysis of their field visit would take some time. Badnore also asked the municipal corporation chief to ensure that essential items were available in all containment zones.Meanwhile, MC chief KK Yadav said the temporary shifting of the Sector 26 mandi to ISBT, Sector 17, had been completed. Necessary sanitisation and social distancing were being maintained in the area, he said.Arun Kumar Gupta, principal secretary (health), said a post-discharge centre had been set up at Sood Dharamshala for patients with mild symptoms. Adviser Manoj Parida said several reliefs were being granted by the Centre for the benefit of the poor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/4-out-of-6-containment-zones-account-for-just-4-of-total-cases-in-chandigarh/story-vG2fK3QZ5ZwRaBBbpYKxaN.html
16-05-2020||Chandigarh||Covid impact:Those who fed Chandigarh’s needy now struggle to earn two square meals||There was a time when this roadside ‘tandoor’ based out of Sector 37, Chandigarh, used to feed hundreds of people. Now, after over 50 days of lockdown, 60-year-old Ramlal and his 35-year-old son Vikas Kumar who run the eatery are themselves deprived of food.“Hum toh dusron ko khilate the, kabhi socha nahin tha ki khud do waqt ki roti khane ko nahin milegi (we used to feed others; never thought we would be deprived of two meals a day),” said Kumar with tears of helplessness. “All my savings are depleted. My son had just started school, my mother, brothers and wife are dependent on me.”“Lagta hai ki ye ek sapna hai, yakeen nahi hota ki pichle do mahine se hum berozgaar hain (all this seems like a nightmare, I can’t believe that I am unemployed for the last two months),” he sobbed.Hundreds of such street food vendors, tiffin walas, dhabas and tandoors are struggling to keep their kitchen fires running in the wake of huge losses amid the lockdown.‘MAY CHANGE PROFESSION’Ravinder Kumar, a 44-year-old man running a tiffin service in the city for over 12 years, is now thinking of selling vegetables and fruits. “With zero income for the last two months, I am rethinking whether to continue the tiffin services. Even if they let us open, most of my customers are students who are not coming back anytime soon,” he said.MIGRANTS WORKING AS HELPERS LEFT JOBLESS Many of the migrants, who were working in these city dhabas and restaurants, are now waiting to board the Shramik Special trains back home as they have no work or source of income.Ram Manohar, who worked as a cook at a dhaba in Sector 15, said, “Our malik (owner) used to give us Rs 200-300 to buy ration every week. Instead of cooking for the dhaba, we used to cook for ourselves. Somehow we have survived for 50 days, but now even our owner has stopped giving us allowances.”“Help us get a train back to Uttar Pradesh,” pleaded Manohar in desperation.NOT IN A POSITION TO REOPENEven if the lockdown was eased, 54-year-old Narinder Singh, running a tandoor near the Sector 19 gurdwara, said, “I am not in a position to reopen after incurring such huge losses. Our business has been closed since December because the UT administration refused to give us a permit. Later, in March, when we got the permission, the lockdown was announced. It has been over six months that we are struggling and we might not be able to reopen.”“My daughter was supposed to get married this year. My son was to complete his graduation.

Sardari Lal, an 80-year-old man who ran this roadside food facility for the poor, students and outsiders, said he had never seen such a situation where he had to close business for two months. “Ab hamara bhavishya ishwar ke upper hai (now, our future is in God’s hands),” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/covid-impact-those-who-fed-the-city-beautiful-are-now-sleeping-on-empty-stomachs/story-VRixTrVzVO78WbTfAcvpUI.html

16-05-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body to provide PPEs to private clinics to screen citizens in containment zones for Covid-19||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Thursday decided to provide personal protective equipment (PPE) to private clinics located near or inside containment zones to screen citizens for Covid-19. The civic body said that the decision to provide PPEs was taken because private clinics within containment zones have been reluctant to open their doors for citizens owing to fear of transmission. “A week’s requirement of PPEs may be given as advance supply to such clinics [near or inside containment zones] also. Each ward officer shall collect 1,000 PPEs from Andheri Sports Complex immediately and distribute [among the clinics],” additional municipal commissioner P Velrasu stated in a circular.BMC claimed that roping in private clinics would help them screen maximum number of citizens and in the early detection of coronavirus cases. “BMC is intending to help the private clinics inside and near the containment zones with PPE kits to facilitate checking people who may display symptoms. These clinics shall help in early detection of coronavirus infected persons which would help in early isolation and extending necessary medical assistance,” the circular further read.The BMC has been running fever clinics in the containment zones to screen citizens, apart from checking patients in municipal dispensaries. Until May 12, BMC had screened more than 15,000 citizens in fever clinics and collected 4,500 swabs of suspected patients, of whom 392 were tested positive. BMC will also give PPEs to ambulance drivers who ferry Covid-19 patients. “Vehicles provided by transport commissioner and BEST [Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation] buses will be used [for frontline workers], and are being modified. However, all ward officers have been asked to give drivers and helpers of ambulances with a PPE kit, along with food and provisions for using washrooms in Covid-19 care centres.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-to-provide-ppes-to-private-clinics-to-screen-citizens-in-containment-zones-for-covid-19/story-ipArBjKletjAQe2XWKvTRP.html

On Thursday evening, a 75-year-old asthmatic woman from Sonepat’s Tharu village who had died on the way to civil hospital was tested positive for the virus, said officials. It may be recalled that while there have been five Covid-related deaths in Faridabad, three in Panipat and two in Ambala, one each has been reported from Sonepat, Karnal and Rohtak.Meanwhile, though the state bulletin did not mention it, a truck driver and its cleaner who were on their way back from Kashmir were also found positive and have been put in isolation at Ambala after the Kashmir administration informed their Ambala counterparts.36 NEW CASES EMERGEHaryana saw 36 new cases on Friday, including 12 from Sonepat. Most of these cases were contacts of vegetable sellers. A staff nurse of BPS medical college at Khanpur Kalan and a local, who is working at a Delhi hospital, were among the new cases in Sonepat. Likewise, nine cases each were reported from Gurugram and Faridabad, two each from Kaithal and Panchkula and one each from Nuh and Rohtak.MAN, DAUGHTER FOUND INFECTED IN KAITHALA 30-year-old man and his two-year-old daughter have tested positive for coronavirus in Kaithal.IGP Hardeep Doon said the infected persons belonged to Dhand village and they had returned from Delhi on May 10. He said they had reported at the civil hospital in Kurukshetra and their test results came out positive on Friday. IGP Doon said they have been admitted to the Covid-19 hospital in Shahbad and their family members have been quarantined. 25 MORE DISCHARGED, RECOVERY RATE 54%On Friday, 25 more patients were discharged after their treatment, taking the state’s recovery rate further up to 54.33%.

16-05-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai’s Wankhede stadium to be converted into Covid facility||Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Friday notified the Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) to hand over the Wankhede stadium premises to the civic body so that it can be converted into a temporary facility to house emergency BMC staff from the A ward as well as quarantine high-risk contacts of positive patients, if necessary.In response to Friday’s notice, MCA’s president Dr Vijay Patil said, “During these unprecedented times, Mumbai Cricket Association will extend all possible support to the government authorities fighting this pandemic.” As a policy, BMC is acquiring gymnasiums, clubs, marriage halls, dormitories at schools and colleges, hotels and lodges and grounds temporarily, to convert them to Covid Care Centers, as a contingency plan for a possible surge in Covid-19 cases.Sanjeev Jaiswal, additional municipal commissioner in BMC, in charge of managing hospitals, healthcare centres, and quarantine facilities in Mumbai said, “Like Wankhede stadium, we are also readying other gymkhanas such as the Police Gymkhana, Parsi Gymkhana, Islam Gymkhana, for Covid care centres (CCC). However, the grounds at these places are not apt for housing high-risk contacts of Covid-19 positive patients. CCC1, used for quarantining high-risk contacts have to be in standalone buildings. There have to be separate rooms or cubicles, and toilet facilities. In large centres like these gymkhanas, cubicles will have to be made.” Jaiswal said such large facilities can instead be care centres for positive asymptomatic and mild symptomatic.At Wankhede Stadium, spaces under the pavilion of the stadium, which is enclosed, ventilated, and has access to bathroom facilities will be converted to quarantine facilities.BMC is also scaling beds at existing CCC1 facilities to 1,00,000 by the end of May or by the first week of June, to support its contact tracing efforts. Jaiswal said, “One aspect of this is we are preparing for cases that will come up in June. What will be needed in June needs to be ready in May. Going by the present mathematical projection of rising in cases, BMC is scaling up beds at dedicated Covid hospitals, dedicated Covid health centres, and Covid care centres.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-s-wankhede-stadium-to-be-converted-into-covid-facility/story-IidKepvrNOIzeylzNP87XI.html

Mumbai’s Covid-19 death toll has reached 655, while 4,568 patients have been treated and discharged from quarantine facilities.Of the 933 new cases reported on Friday, 231 were confirmed by private labs, where patients were tested on Tuesday and Wednesday. On Thursday, the city had recorded 998 cases – the highest number of new cases ever reported. As per data by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), around 31% (5,545) of the total cases in the city were reported in the past one week, with an average of 765 new cases reported each day. In the densely-populated Dharavi, 84 cases of Covid-19 were reported on Friday, taking the total count in India’s largest slums to 1,145. With four deaths reported on Friday, Dharavi’s Covid-19 death tally stands at 53. As per data from the G-North ward (Dharavi, Dadar, Mahim), there were 11 new cases in Dadar and 14 in Mahim on Friday. The ward has the highest number (1,471) of Covid-19 cases among all the 24 administrative wards in the city.On Friday, nine staffers of BMC’s disaster management control room were also tested positive for Covid-19, taking the total number of operators in the control room ailing from the virus to 14. “After five more staffers were tested positive, they were shifted to hotels for quarantine,” a senior civic official said.”Meanwhile, several Covid-19 patients were shifted to Covid Care Centres (CCC) that are set up across the city. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Friday inspected a CCC-2 centre (meant to quarantine mild symptomatic or asymptomatic patients) at the NESCO exhibition centre in Goregaon. NESCO Centre will house 1,240 beds, some of which will have oxygen facilities as well. BMC is preparing separate arrangements for women and men, with running hot water systems and fans for each bed.With a spike in the number of cases in the city and amid concerns of timely transfer of patients to quarantine centres and hospitals, BMC converted 70 Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) buses and 15 Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) buses into mini-ambulances to ferry suspected and asymptomatic patients or those with mild symptoms from their homes to CCCs. Citizens can call on BMC’s disaster helpline 1916 to access the ambulance services, virtual doctor advice and beds availability information.Meanwhile, the civic body conducted a joint meeting with the suburban divisions of the western and central railways through video conferencing on Friday for completing pre-monsoon works such as desilting railway culverts, providing dewatering pumps, measures for mitigating flooding at railway yards. BMC also asked railways to expedite permissions on areas under the latter’s jurisdiction for works related to Hancock, Nahur, Vidyavihar and Vikhroli rail overbridges (RoB).

16-05-2020||Today's||Covid-19 and a realisation: The migrant worker is indispensable||The Covid-19 pandemic, besides taking a toll on human life, has brought to focus the underbelly of society. The well-off segment of Chandigarh (the smug bourgeoisie), have always blamed politicians for peopling the city with ‘bhaiyas’ (pejoratively used for migrant labour) only for building their vote-banks. I have often been confronted by friends with the question, “When, for God’s sake, will you ever come out of the colonies?”When I came to Chandigarh as a college student in 1965, I saw labourers staying in temporary shacks near construction sites even in a sector like 17. Their makeshift shanties lacked amenities and their children played on the sand and gravel dumps as the parents slogged for paltry wages.Concomitant with the growth of the city, grew the need for more workers. Households and commercial establishments needed helps for diverse jobs. As those from the region did not consider it rewarding enough to shift here for low-paying manual jobs, there began an inflow of workers from other states, leading to unauthorised squatting on government land. Owners of land that was yet to be acquired found it profitable to let out rows of small plots with narrow lanes to migrant labour. A modicum of civic services such as a few toilets, water stand posts and open drains came to be provided later.REHABILITATING WORKERSWaking up to Le Corbusier’s Edict of Chandigarh being compromised by the growth of unhygienic shanties in a modern city, which by then had become a Union Territory, courtesy the wrangling states of Punjab and Haryana, the UT administration came up with schemes to build tenements or allot vacant plots in planned colonies for the rehabilitation of labourers in the peripheral areas or even within the city.Before that, it was only the ‘cheap houses’ that were built for the dhobis (washermen) or for the government sanitation staff etc. Besides this, an otherwise elaborate plan of the new city did not provide for adequate socio-economic integration in the form of general low-cost housing. The smallest size of a plot for non-government houses was four marlas (100 sq yd) in this oasis of affluence.SLUM-FREE CHANDIGARHOn getting the privilege of representing Chandigarh in the Lok Sabha in 1991, a priority I marked for myself was making the city slum-free. There was gradual progress, but it was only under a scheme of 2006 that a need of about 25,000 dwelling units was projected to achieve the zero-slum target. Funds under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) came in adequate measure. No new squatters’ colony has sprung up since and only one colony stands on private land.The migrant labourers were, in the meantime, cursed for being a burden on others: for eating away subsidies, for paying no taxes, for making the city unclean, for generating heaps of garbage, for crime and what not! “If they work for us, they get paid for it,” has been our self-righteous attitude towards them. Analyses of the last two elections point to these people moving away from me, yet my belief in them remained unshaken.Then came this invisible micro-organism called novel coronavirus. Its spread forced a lockdown on over 130 crore Indians, including the 12 lakh plus people of Chandigarh. With just a four-hour notice, all movement of humans stopped; shops, factories, educational institutions, hotels, restaurants, theatres, cinema halls, salons, parlours, private clinics, even normal OPDs in government hospitals came to an abrupt halt.There were no vendors selling fruits and vegetables, balloons, or other knick-knacks for children in deserted streets, no maids for household chores, no access to gyms for the fitness freaks, no entry to parlours and salons or services of a beautician at home.LEFT HIGH AND DRYWe stood deprived of all services that we had so far taken for granted. The effect of the lockdown began to sink in and the importance of the role that migrant labour plays in our lives became more and more pronounced. On the other hand, the migrants, holed up in one-room tenements, losing their source of daily bread, came to the brink of starvation. With no cash in their pockets, most of them stared at starvation. In desperation, they embarked upon a trek to their places of origin, even a thousand kilometres away.Covid-fearing officials along the state borders aborted their plans. Now, the Indian Railways have started running special shramik (workers) trains to ferry the migrants desirous of rejoining their separated families. The registration centre in Sector 43 now overflows with people clamouring for a ticket back home.LOCKDOWN HIGHLIGHTS INEQUALITYTell-tale stories of agonising hardships normally highlight the inequality in a ‘welfare’ state. This only stands more pronounced during this lockdown. Yet, it has thrown up a situation where, for once, we who constitute the upper crust of society feel the pinch of having to do without the services that had been available for the asking. Only a few thousand persons, including women and children, have boarded the special trains so far, but a change is already perceptible.We now want the departing ones to stay on. They are no more a burden on society; they pay all (indirect) taxes included in the retail prices of goods that they are able to afford, they consume less and, therefore, generate less trash; their areas are not cleaned daily and, therefore, the heaps of garbage that give them company 24x7.The entrepreneurs know what the economists have said: Labour’s contribution to production is more than that of capital. For the wheel of progress to keep moving, the migrant worker is indispensable. This is the truth that Covid-19 has brought home to us.The writer is a former Union minister||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/covid-19-and-a-realisation-the-migrant-worker-is-indispensable/story-Fx0pPh2Ztaa42KoqH5eOWP.html

16-05-2020||City||Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra likely to peak by June-end, says health minister||Expecting a peak in the number of coronavirus cases by the end of June, the state plans to issue directives to all private hospitals and nursing homes in Mumbai to reserve 60% beds for Covid-19 patients. State health minister Rajesh Tope on Friday said that chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has been requested to take this decision to tide over the shortage of beds for moderate and serious coronavirus patients in the city. The remaining 40% beds will be kept for other patients. This is as per a recommendation made by a taskforce led by Dr Sanjay Oak, which was formed by the state government to bring down the mortality rate. Thackeray is yet to take a call on the request. Since May 6, Maharashtra has been recording more than 1,000 cases daily. On Thursday, it saw 1,602 cases, the highest one-day spike so far. Mumbai recorded 991 cases on Thursday, which was the sharpest single-day spike recorded so far. Since May 1, the state has reported as many as 18,602 cases, whereas the total number of cases registered in April month was 10,201. On Friday, the state’s tally reached 29,100 cases, while in Mumbai, the total number of cases stands at 17,671. Tope said they expect the cases to peak by June end. “All predictions about rise in cases in Mumbai and Maharashtra have not come true, but the numbers are rising and peak is yet to come. Going by mathematical predictions, the actual peak is likely to come by the end of June. It means, the number of cases in Mumbai will increase four times (over 60,000 cases). We are trying to prevent it, but we need to be prepared for the worst and hope for the best,” Tope said.Unlike other red zones in the state, Mumbai is facing shortage of beds for dedicated Covid Health Centers and Dedicated Covid Hospitals (DCH). DCHC provide services to Covid-19 patients with mild and moderate symptoms, while serious patients are admitted to DCH. “We need more beds for mild or moderate and serious patients in Mumbai. Availability of ICU beds is again a challenge. I have requested chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to issue directives to all private hospitals in Mumbai to reserve 60-80% beds for Covid-19 patients. With this, we will be able to utilize all beds at private hospitals, which are not in use due to the pandemic,” Tope said.The health minister said that the hospitals will run with their existing staff. The only change is that the beds will be reserved for Covid-19 patients. The rest of the beds in the hospitals will be kept for others cases such as pregnancy, stroke, ischemic heart disease, cancer, and accidents.Many private hospitals in the city are vacant at present, with not even 25% occupancy. “The treatment will be affordable as it will be based on the General Insurers Public Sector Association (GIPSA) policy or the package determined under Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Aarogya Yojana (MJPJAY) under which the state government provides free treatment and surgeries for 1,100 ailments,” Tope said.Tope said the hospitals won’t be able to ignore the government directives. “When will they serve the city if not now? We have given them land and they are running under charitable trusts. We have many legislations such as Epidemic Diseases Act, Maharashtra Essential Services and Maintenance Act and Maharashtra Public Trust Act etc. under which action can be taken against them, if they do not follow orders,” he said.A senior representative from a well-known hospital said they have to follow government orders. “If the government passes such an order, we will have no option but to accept it considering the current circumstances,” he said, requesting not to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-cases-in-maharashtra-likely-to-peak-by-june-end-says-health-minister/story-elJQTAk33ueOSSSqVctOaK.html
16-05-2020||Chandigarh||Lockdown, breezy summer hit Bathinda’s room cooler industry||The air cooler manufacturing industry of Bathinda, which is considered to be the largest in Punjab, is severely hit by lockdown due to coronavirus outbreak and a cooler summer this year.There are around 100 factories engaged in manufacturing of room coolers and ancillary units in Bathinda, making it the hub of cooler manufacturing sector in the region.Industry sources say that against the average production of five lakh units of coolers, this season, the local units may not be able to supply half of it due to low availability of trained workers and steel sheets.A leading cooler manufacturer and ex-president of the Bathinda industrial growth centre, Kapil Goyal, said that since steel plants are not fully functional, cooler manufacturing sector is facing a shortage of raw material.“When lockdown was imposed in Punjab on March 22, manufacturers had a stock of raw material for a few days. As manufacturing began from May 5, there is no supply of steel sheets. Moreover, transporters have increased charges and the frail industry is unable to bear the additional expenses,” he said.Vikram Lakhi, president of the North India Cooler and Fan Manufacturing Association, said that Bathinda caters to the demands of markets in Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and parts of western Uttar Pradesh, but the prevalent climatic conditions are giving a severe blow to the cooler sector.“Maximum temperature even in the semi-arid areas of southern Punjab is hovering around 35 degree Celsius. Owing to the ongoing climatic conditions, the demand for coolers is quite low. It is unfair to charge average electricity bill for the period when manufacturing was prohibited by the state government,” said Lakhi.Another entrepreneur, Ashu Goyal, said the Bathinda cooler industry has a sizeable dependence on workers from other states who are not ready work in Punjab right now.“During lockdown, the workers were duly provided food and wages but as factories resume operations, workers have refused to work. We lost our peak season of manufacturing coolers to the lockdown and the future seems bleak,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/lockdown-breezy-summer-hit-bathinda-s-room-cooler-industry/story-upDmrKGVzXTX59ihRprFPN.html

They have also requested the university to change the office timings for the employees. PU reopened its offices on May 13 after getting a nod from the UT administration to run offices with 33% staff on rotational basis amid the Covid-19 outbreak. However, the non-teaching staff association has written to the varsity that many of the staffers who used to come to the offices using public transport are unable to report to work. Panjab University Staff (non-teaching) Association (PUSA) president Deepak Kaushik said, “We welcome PU’s step to reopen the offices. However, we have received calls from many employees who are unable to come to the offices as they rely on public transport for their movement.”In a letter addressed to PU vice-chancellor Raj Kumar, the employees have requested the authorities to exempt those employees from the duties till public transport becomes functional.Besides this, the employees have also sought changes in the office timings from the varsity administration. The PUSA president said the employees coming to the office were made to stand in queues for a long time in order to get their thermal checkup done. Also, they were asked not to come out of the office till their shift was over, he said. “However, the employees will need to go out of their offices to have lunch and on their return, they will have to wait again for checkup, which will lead to wastage of time. So, we request the administration to change the office timings. The new timings should be from 9am to 2pm without any lunch break in between,” said Deepak Kaushik.PU registrar Karamjeet Singh said, “We have received the letter from the employees and are examining the matter.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/panjab-university-s-non-teaching-staff-relying-on-public-transport-demand-exemption-from-work/story-RnWzSDnUzLQgWPChAQ94eN.html

16-05-2020||Chandigarh||No losses from liquor sale in 2019-20, except during curfew days, says CM||Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Friday said the state excise department has not incurred any losses in 2019-20, except during the curfew period which are being assessed. The CM made this statement after a meeting with excise department officials to ponder over the demand of liquor traders for amendment in the excise policy in the wake of Covid-19 crisis. The statement assumes significance as it comes at a time when the excise department is in the line of fire from the opposition alleging dwindling revenue receipts from liquor sale and contractors are trying to strike a bargain with the government.As per figures released by the excise department, revenue recoveries by March 22 were Rs 5,222 crore, against the annual revenue quota of Rs. 5,676 crore, registering a shortfall of Rs 454 crore.Giving details, a department release said that revenue receipts had shown marked increase since the Amarinder government took over the state in March 2017. The revenues increased from Rs 4,405.72 crore in 2016-17 to Rs 5,135.68 crore in 2017-18, registering a 16% increase. Noting that in 2019-20, curfew was imposed from March 23, the officials said that all the fees (fixed licence fee and additional fixed licence fee) for 2020-21, which were to be deposited in the March could not be deposited. This included Rs 278 crore for renewed groups, Rs 68 crore from the newly allotted groups and another Rs 120 crore in routine receipts which could not be deposited on account of the curfew restrictions, they added.Hence, Rs 466 crore was not received in March 2020 by the state exchequer, the release said. Taking these figures into account, the actual receipts for the year would, in fact, turn out to be much higher than last year’s, the officials added.The excise department also stated that all allotted vends in the state have now opened in the state, except those in the containment zones. GoM MEETS LIQUOR CONTRACTORS Meanwhile, in a meeting with Punjab government’s group of ministers (GoM) on Friday, liqour contractors demanded amendment in the excise policy for the current financial year, so as to avert their apprehended losses. The contractors are are demanding that the annual quota of liquor fixed at Rs 6,200 crore be reworked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/no-losses-from-liquor-sale-in-2019-20-except-during-curfew-days-says-cm/story-lTxcSWX6uSxs0i3AprPIdP.html

However, imposing a complete ban on these fires still remains a challenge for the authorities as 364 cases of stubble burning were reported in the state on Thursday. As per the data of the pollution control board (HSPCB), Jhajjar district reported the highest number of stubble burning cases (364), followed by Jind (260), Sirsa (234), Rohtak (228), Fatehabad (210), Hisar (202), Bhiwani (102), Panipat (69), Karnal (50) and Kaithal (46). S Narayanan, member secretary, Haryana state pollution control board, said, “I think the awareness factor may be a reason behind a steep decline in the incidents of stubble burning in the state.”He said the wheat stubble also has economic value as it is a good feed for cattle. “But, continuous efforts by the ground-level officials and awareness among the farmers helped to reduce the number of incidents of stubble burning in the state,” he added. About the future plans to put a complete check on stubble burning, Narayanan said, “A good publicity has already been done and it brought favourable results. In future, more campaigns will be launched to make farmers aware about the harmful effects of burning the crop waste.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/haryana-sees-62-dip-in-stubble-burning-cases/story-Bt1Xc4qHWNlpuv0bztliYM.html
16-05-2020||Chandigarh||Left homeless, migrants in Chandigarh caught between the devil and the deep blue sea||Even as 1,200 migrants were supposed to board the 2pm train to Bihar on Friday, over 2,000 turned up at the Inter State Bus Terminal (ISBT) in Sector 43, Chandigarh, on Friday. According to the officials, this has become a routine affair as many migrants stranded in Chandigarh are coming here without receiving the necessary SMS for boarding buses to the railway station. But, for these labourers, there is no other option, as they are homeless and have nowhere else to go.‘KICKED OUT’After the train had departed, migrants could be seen sitting by the slip roads between Sectors 43 and 42 and between Sectors 41 and 42, even as a few policemen tried maintaining social distancing here. Among them, Nageshwar Sarna, said, “I gave up the room that I had rented in Maloya as I had not paid any rent and my landlord was threatening to force me out. I have tried to tell the police that I have nowhere else to go but they are not ready to listen.” When asked, he said he was unaware that landlords weren’t supposed to collect rent during the lockdown.Near the Sector 43/44 roundabout, Arjun, who hails from Uttar Pradesh, said he was living in Faidan village with his uncle, but he had kicked him out. “We had no money to eat and my uncle was refusing to feed me. When he got to know that trains are taking people back to their native places, he told me to get going. For two days, I have been coming here but my turn hasn’t come,” he said.Seventeen-year-old Pankaj Kumar was standing with his two brothers next to the Sector 17 ISBT . “We were living with a cousin here who misbehaved with us frequently and made us leave. I have nowhere to go tonight. A friend of mine had a place here, but he boarded the train back home on Friday,” Kumar said.One of the UT administration officials on duty here said, “Many people are coming here without getting the text messages. On Wednesday, some people who had the SMS couldn’t leave from the bus stand, while others went to their place in the confusion. They had to be adjusted on Thursday.” He said migrants from as far as Chamkaur Sahib had also reached the station hoping to catch a train.About 1.5 lakh people have registered for the Shramik Special trains from Chandigarh. Of these, 12,500 have already departed from the city in 10 trains. Chandigarh station superintendent Anil Aggarwal said it was not fixed till when the trains will continue, but two trains a day can be expected to depart at least till May 20. GURDWARAS PITCH INMeanwhile, city gurdwaras are stepping in to feed the migrants left homeless. As per manager of the Sector 34 gurdwara, Amanjeet Singh, food for 1,500 people was being sent out daily through government agencies. Head cook of the Sector 8 gurdwara, Harminder Singh, said 700 food packets were being sent to Sector 43 per day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/left-homeless-migrants-in-chandigarh-forced-to-wait-their-turn-on-roads-for-homecoming/story-fI5JNIPAFqxzgqTYb4g8vJ.html

16-05-2020||City||Liquor vends open, get tepid response on Day 1 in Ludhiana||Over a week after the government allowed the sale of liquor in the state, vends in Ludhiana opened on Friday from 7am to 6pm, but got a tepid response, perhaps due to shortage of money with residents, especially the labour class. The vendors had marked circles outside their vends to maintain social distancing, but no rush of buyers was witnessed at the vends.A few contractors rued that they were forced to open the vends by the government and the district administration even when the government has failed to provide any relief to the sector. The wine contractors are demanding a review of the excise policy, including withdrawal of the quota condition.There are around 750 vends in the district, including those in Khanna, Samrala, Jagraon and all had remained shut for two months. The state government earns an annual revenue of around Rs 1,100 crore from liquor vends, which comes to over Rs 3 crore on a daily basis. The vends have remained closed since March 22.A group of contractors also conducted a meeting with education minister Vijay Inder Singla and housing and urban development Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria in Chandigarh on Friday. Finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal could not participate in the meeting due to demise of his father, Gurdas Badal.Leading the group of contractors, Varinder Sharma said, “The government is giving a positive response and the ministers have assured a solution in a day or two. The vends have been opened in the district and would remain open.”Another contractor, requesting anonymity, said, “The government wants the contractors to open vends and pay fee. But, it is not giving any relief to the vendors, though they have suffered huge losses. Rather than forcing contractors to open vends, the government should provide immediate relief to the contractors by reviewing the excise policy,” said the contractor, adding less than 1% sale was witnessed at his vends on Friday. The liquor shop owners in Ludhiana have refused to provide home delivery service.Vinay, a worker at a liquor vend in the Focal Point area, said due to prolonged lockdown, labour is not having money to purchase liquor, due to which vends wore a deserted look on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/liquor-vends-open-get-tepid-response-on-day-1-in-ludhiana/story-MOOaR2zbznw5MGfrZYMSoM.html
16-05-2020||City||Missing liquor case: Prime accused complains of chest pain, shifted to PGIMS Rohtak||The main accused in missing liquor case Bhupinder Singh on Friday was admitted to the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences (PGIMS), Rohtak after he complained of chest pain.He was in police custody since Monday after 5,500 boxes of liquor went missing from a godown belonging to his mother in Sonepat’s Kharkhauda. CMO at a community health centre in Kharkhauda Dr Ravish said that the police brought Bhupinder to the centre on Friday evening after he complained of chest pain and fell unconscious.“We have referred him to PGIMS, Rohtak after giving him primary treatment,” he added. Meanwhile, residents of Sisana village gheraoed the Kharkhauda community health centre after Bhupinder was brought there and accused the police of assaulting the liquor trader.Sarpanch of the village Munni Devi alleged that police had thrashed Bhupinder while he was in their custody. “The police want to kill Bhupinder after names of officials from their department had cropped up in the case,” she added.Later, Kharkhauda DSP Harender Kumar and SHO Mandeep took Bhupinder to PGIMS, Rohtak in an ambulance. Refuting the allegations, Harender Kumar said that the accused was brought to the health centre after his health deteriorated. The police did not thrash him. A three-member special investigation team along with Sonepat police is probing the role of some liquor traders, two former SHOs, some policemen and excise officials behind this liquor scam. Two former Kharkhauda SHOs, who were suspended last week for their alleged role in the case are on the run, and the police are making efforts to nab them.A police official privy to the development said that during the course of investigation Bhupinder had revealed that he along with his accomplices was involved in selling Haryana-made liquor in Punjab by using fake labels. “The accused also confessed to carrying a spare key of the godown, from where 5,500 boxes of liquor went missing. We have also recovered 1,400 boxes of illicit liquor from the same godown,” the police added.The police had also seized ₹97 lakh in cash, two pistols and three mobile phones besides a sports utility vehicle following a raid at Bhupinder’s house in Chandigarh on Sunday.

16-05-2020||Mumbai||State’s case count goes up to 29,100; govt calls for lockdown extension||Maharashtra’s coronavirus case count went up to 29,100 with the addition of 1,576 infections on Friday, as the state government said it is in favour of extending the lockdown.India’s worst-affected state accounts for more than 35% of the total cases in the country. The worst-hit city, Mumbai, reported 933 new cases, its second-highest single-day spike, taking the total to 17,671. The state’s death toll went up to 1,068, including 655 in Mumbai. Of Friday’s 49 deaths, 34 were in Mumbai, six in Pune, two each in Dhule, Kalyan-Dombivli, Akola city and one each in Panvel, Jalgaon and Aurangabad city. Twenty-two of the patients who died on Friday were above 60 years of age, while 23 were in the age group of 40 to 59 years and the remaining were below the age of 40 years. Thirty-two of them had high-risk comorbidities including diabetes, hypertension and heart ailments.The state has seen 10,037 cases in seven days, while the deaths reported in this period were 337. Mumbai reported 5,529 cases and 193 deaths in the past seven days. With an average of more than 1,400 cases a day over the past week, the state is set to cross the 30,000 mark on Saturday. Meanwhile, the state on Friday submitted its position to the Centre on extending the lockdown, according to officials. The state is in favour of extension with more relaxations in less affected zones, so as to ensure economic activities resume gradually.“We have already given the nod for industrial activities in green and orange zones with some conditions and are getting good response. A total of 38,287 industrial units with a workforce of 10.66 lakh workers are in operation in the state. With more relaxations for industrial and commercial activities in these two zones, we also expect more commercial activities to resume in red zones too,” said a senior government official.State health minister Rajesh Tope said that the decision about red zones will be taken by May 18, but the state government is considering easing the lockdown in non-affected areas in red-zone districts too. “There will be more commercial and industrial activities allowed in green and orange zones from Monday by keeping the district’s borders sealed. Non-essential shops could be allowed in a staggered manner. We are also of the opinion that non-affected tehsils or areas in red zones should also have restrictions relaxed. Like for Pune, activities can be allowed in tehsils where there are no cases,” he said. The state government is also planning to resume registration of land deals and vehicles. Largely affected cities like Mumbai, Thane, Navi Mumbai, Pune, Nashik may also see relaxations in commercial operations. “We will wait for the Central directives for lockdown implementation in red zones. The state cannot relax restrictions imposed by the Centre, although it has the right to impose stricter norms. We expect more activities to be allowed outside containment areas in red zones and that would help us ease restrictions in big cities,” said another official who is privy to the development. The number of tests in the state touched 2,50,436 on Friday. 22,1336 of them were negative. Of the 10,291 tests conducted in the past 24 hours, 1,576 tested positive at 15.31%. Maharashtra’s mortality rate has dropped to 3.70%, still above the national rate of 3.23%, while the doubling of cases rate in Maharashtra is little more than 10 days.A total of 3,29,302 people are currently under home quarantine, while 16,306 are under institutional quarantine. 14,167 teams of health workers have screened 58.97 lakh peoples. A total of 6,564 patients have fully recovered at various hospitals, after testing positive in the past nine weeks.The state has 1,473 containment zones. In Mumbai, the municipal corporation has broken the zones into smaller ones for better monitoring.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, his deputy Ajit Pawar discussed the extension of the lockdown and exit plan with Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar at the bungalow earmarked for the Bal Thackeray memorial in Dadar. Senior ministers and key officials from the government attended the meeting. Pawar reportedly suggested the state government to go for easing restrictions on industrial and commercial activities as it would help the government revive the state economy, which has sustained huge losses due to the lockdown.After the meeting, chief secretary Ajoy Mehta had a video conference with the cabinet secretary of the Centre, during which the state’s stand on the lockdown was submitted. Representatives of industries and businesses in commercial activities have requested the state government to allow more activities in green and orange zones. In its memorandum to Thackeray, Retailers Association of India (RAI) has demanded that micromarkets in non-containment areas should be considered. “It may be prudent if the suburbs are demarcated ward-wise and stores in non-containment zones are identified and allowed to open,” said Kumar Rajagopalan, CEO of RAI. He said that the malls, too, should be allowed without theatres and food malls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/state-s-case-count-goes-up-to-29-100-govt-calls-for-lockdown-extension/story-bqhtu2pwL4BKV6U7dQgAXK.html

A majority of industrialists are currently working to lubricate the machinery and sanitise the establishments as the units have remained shut for at least two months but the operations are expected to gain momentum from MondayThe micro and small industry is relieved that now it will not have to bear the fixed expenses, including salaries of workers and electricity bills, with their units closed.Around 50,000 units are situated in mixed land use and non-designated areas of the city, which mostly include cycle parts and hosiery units. As per information, the micro/tiny industries in these areas constitute about 50% of the industrial set-up in the district, and employ about 5-6 lakh workers.President of the Janta Nagar Small Scale Manufacturers Association (JNSSMA) Jaswinder Thukral said, “The industry in mixed land-use areas has slowly started coming back on track and production will pick up pace in 3-4 days. Hailing the decision of the state government, Thukral said this will also stop the movement of labour out of the city.”“The labourers are leaving the city due to lack of work, but now at least the industrial labourers will not move out as the industries in both designated and mixed land-use areas have commenced operations,” said Thukral.President of the Knitwear and Textile Club Vinod Thapar said, “The hosiery industry has suffered a loss of around Rs 1,000 crore due to the lockdown and the state government has permitted the industry to open at the right time, as now they will be able to manufacture the products for winter.”President of the Federation of Industrial and Commercial Organisations (FICO) Gurmeet Singh Kular and president of the Chamber of Industrial and Commercial Undertakings (CICU) Upkar Ahuja said it was also a relief for the large industry, which would not have been able to operate for long in the absence of micro and small units in mixed land use areas. They said many of the units in mixed land-use areas do the labour job for large industries.

Following the screening, about 31,725 residents were directed to remain under home quarantine and 5,857 were put in institutional quarantine. On Friday, Dharavi recorded 84 new Covid-19 cases taking the total tally to 1,145. At least 53 people have succumbed to the disease in Dharavi so far. Under the door-to-door screening method, around 47,500 people screened in high-risk zones. Out of which, 2,000 suspected cases were identified and 600 had undergone tests. Under the focus area method, BMC ensured the supply of food, groceries and medicine inside the high-risk zones to restrict the movement .However, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Kirit Somaiya alleged that home quarantine will increase the corona cases to 10,000. “Dharavi has 38,643 high-risk persons. Out of which 31,725 kept as home quarantine in 120 sqft rooms where eight to10 people stay together and use public toilets which will result in 10,000 more positive cases,” he said.Refuting to these allegations, Kiran Dighavkar, assistant commissioner of the G-North Ward said, “ Around 31,725 people were identified as low-risk contacts and hence they were advised home quarantine.

16-05-2020||Chandigarh||Illegal distillery: Accused made huge profits by making liquor from ENA||The illegal distillery-cum-liquor-bottling plant, which was unearthed at Ghanaur in Patiala district on Thursday, was making huge money during the lockdown by selling illicit liquor under the guise of popular brands.The accused, who were operating the distillery from a cold store, were making liquor by diluting extra neutral alcohol (ENA), which is available at a cheap price, and sold it at exorbitant rates.“ENA costs Rs 52 per litre and has 70% of alcohol. It’s basic raw material for every hard drink. For human consumption, you have to dilute it to 40% alcohol by mixing water, and give a flavour of your popular whisky or desi brand by adding readymade flavours and colours, which are easily available in the market. For example, they packed it as Royal Stag whisky at a cost of Rs 40 per 750 ML, which is sold as 400 per bottle in illicit market, whereas its price at the vends is above Rs 500,” said an excise official.He said the police have been requested to ascertain from where the accused were procuring ENA as it is made in only 17 liqour distilleries. Khanpur Khurd sarpanch Amrik Singh, who is also an aide of Congress MLA Madan Lal Jalalpur; and Dipesh Kumar of Rajpura were booked after Thursday’s raid.MLA KAMBOJ DENIES LINK WITH ACCUSED However, Rajpura MLA Hardial Singh Kamboj said that he has no links with accused Dipesh Kumar. “I have not met him or spoken to him on phone for the past one-and-a-half years. How can anyone link him with me? Its misinformation spread by my political opponents. Dipesh is relative of a former BJP MLA of the area,” he said.OPPN SEEKS PROBE INTO ROLE OF CONG LEADERSMeanwhile, leader of opposition and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA Harpal Singh Cheema demanded a probe into the role of Congress leaders into the matter. Akali Dal leader Prem Singh Chandumajra and Surjit Singh Rakhra alleged that it was political plunder of the state exchequer and demanded attachment of the property of the accused to recover the loss in excise revenues.SIT FORMED TO PROBE MATTERMeanwhile, Patiala SSP Mandeep Singh Sidhu said a special investigation team (SIT), comprising SP Harmeet Hundal, SP Varun Sharma and DSP Manpreet Thind, will supervise the investigations into the matter and coordinate with excise officials.

16-05-2020||Delhi||‘Only deaths where primary cause is Covid-19 listed’: Delhi govt||Delhi recorded 425 new cases of Covid-19 on Friday, taking the city’s tally to 8,895. And eight deaths were added to Delhi’s coronavirus disease (Covid-19) toll , taking the total number of deaths in the state to 123, although none of the deaths pertain to the past 24 hours. The health bulletin released on Friday stated that the cumulative deaths included only those “where the primary cause of death is found to be Covid-19”, as per report of the death audit committee on the basis of case sheets received from hospital.”The Delhi government ordered the formation of the death audit committee on April 20, which started working two days later. The committee goes through the case sheets, investigations, and death summary of the deceased before classifying it as a Covid-19 death.“The Death Audit Committee follows the guidelines prescribed by the ICMR. All hospitals have been mandated to submit their death summaries to the committee within 24 hours. Death Audit Committee is an independent body which examines each of these cases. Delhi Health Bulletin reflects the figures as declared by the Committee,” said a senior official from the CMO. The guidelines for recording deaths released by Indian Council of Medical Research last week states that Covid-19 has to be recorded as the underlying cause of death when a person dies of pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, cardiac injury, and clotting throughout the bloodstream that the viral infection is known to cause. In Covid-19 patients co-morbid conditions such as asthma, heart disease, diabetes or cancer can lead to severe disease but cannot be considered as the underlying cause of death, the guideline states.“ A person may have tested positive for the infection, but if their chest X-ray is clean, the arterial blood gas does not show any signs of acidosis, and their oxygen saturation is normal then clearly Covid-19 isn’t the cause of death,” said a senior official from Delhi’s health department who spoke on condition of anonymity.Dr Prashant Mathur, director of ICMR’s National Centre for Disease Informatics and Research (NCDIR), which formulated the guidelines, said, “If a patient is admitted to the hospital for Covi-19 and dies, their death would be considered as Covid-19 death.”“But these are just guidelines and it is ultimately the treating physician who has to use their clinical judgement to decide whether it was the infection that aggravated the other comorbid conditions leading to the death. The guidelines were more for awareness, especially about the new coding under the international classification of diseases that has now been added,” said Dr Mathur.The international classification of disease coding present in the 11-page document clearly states that deaths of those who test positive and do not have Covid-19 like symptoms should still be recorded as Covid-19 death. So should the deaths of those who have the symptoms but either test negative or in whose case the test is inconclusive.Delhi’s health minister said the growth rate of new infections is coming down“Do not go by numbers, go by percentage growth. Yesterday, it was around 5%. At one point it was as high as 20%,” said Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain. Of the 5,254 people still living with the infection in the city, 154 are in intensive care units and 26 are on ventilators. Delhi has about 306 ventilators in the government sector and 800 in the private sector.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/only-deaths-where-primary-cause-is-covid-19-listed-delhi/story-fmoiScJ2B8g2RNlINHoj6N.html
16-05-2020||Delhi||Delhi wants to restart life from Monday — with social distance||Markets, malls, public transport, including the Delhi Metro, and all offices should be allowed to open with reduced footfall and staggered operations, Delhi’s chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has said in a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, even as states sent in their recommendations to the Union government on how the country should emerge from the current phase of the lockdown.The Centre is expected to announce over the weekend the contours of the fourth phase of the lockdown, which was first put in place on March 25 to slow the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak. It may give states more say in what rules on restrictions should be in place beginning next week.“We want restrictions in containment zones to stay as they are, but most economic activities should now be allowed elsewhere. Social distancing and wearing masks should be made mandatory. We believe the relaxations will lead to a rise in Covid-19 infections, but we have prepared for it by making adequate arrangements for hospitals, ventilators, oxygen requirements, ambulances, ICUs, etc,” said Kejriwal.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic“We have followed centre’s rules entirely and will work with the Union government in the fight ahead,” the CM said in his closing remarks in Thursday’s letter, which accompanied a detailed set of recommendations.Among the key relaxations is the suggestion to allow public transport. Metro services should be allowed to resume but must allow only people working in government offices during morning and evening office hours, while essential services workers or those with movement passes from district authorities can only travel between 10.30am and 5.30pm, the letter suggested, proposing that the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation make arrangements to leave a seat vacant in between.Auto-rickshaws, buses, cabs (including aggregators such as Ola and Uber), can operate but with reduced capacities. For auto- and cycle-rickshaws, only one passenger will be allowed. Taxis and cabs can seat two in addition to the driver. Buses should carry not more than 20 people, the recommendations said.Also Read: Concerns over infant mortality as Covid hits immunisation drivesMovement of people should be prohibited (unless for essential service) between 9pm and 5am, the Delhi government suggested, and added that parks and playgrounds should be allowed to open with no contact sport being permitted.At present, people are allowed to go out only between 7am and 7pm, unless they are going to a grocery store or a chemist – which are included in essential activities.For offices, the CM suggested that those who can work from home should continue doing so but offices can reopen with 50% staff. All employees must wear masks, and mandatorily download the Aarogya Setu mobile application. The Delhi government has so far not issued any advisory on the app, which has been criticised for possibly being a risk to people’s privacy.Also Read: Govt officials propose more power to states in fight against Covid-19“All markets and market complexes shall remain open on odd-even basis, that is, shops would open on alternate days depending on their shop number… However, shops selling essential goods, books and stationery shops and fans shops are permitted to open on all days,” the letter added.According to an official who asked not to be named, the complete relaxation for shops selling fans will also cover those selling air-conditioners and air coolers, since the city – as the rest of the country – is now heading into peak summer months.For malls, the number of shops allowed to open on any day must not exceed 33%, the proposal said, putting the onus on mall managements to enforce the protocol.School, salons, spas, barber shops, cinema halls, hotels and dine-in services at restaurants and cafes should continue to be prohibited, it said.On some of the recommendations, such as reviving Delhi’s public transport in a way that ensures social distancing during commute, the government has already started drafting standard operating procedures (SOP), said Delhi’s revenue and transport minister Kailash Gahlot.The letter was sent to the Prime Minister after Kejriwal met Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal for a thorough discussion on Thursday evening. Baijal had directed the government to start preparing SOPs starting with three areas – transport, reopening of markets and malls, and construction and industrial activities, said a senior official privy to the developments of the meeting. During what was his fourth address to the nation since the Covid-19 crisis began, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Tuesday night that the new phase of the lockdown — lockdown 4.0 — would assume new contours and be based on new rules. “States are giving us their inputs and advice. Based on that, all details about lockdown will be provided before May 18.” He said that he had complete faith that while abiding by rules, the country would both battle the disease and move forward.The need to reopen has become increasingly acute as economic indicators reflect a complete erosion of earnings. Several market associations have begun discussions to strategise how they will reopen and ensure social distancing, a practice of keeping at least a 2 metre distance between individuals.“Once the market opens, we have decided to keep only two entry points for customers, where there will be hand sanitisers and temperature screening. We will also put up boards saying only those who want to buy should enter the market zone. Social distancing will be of utmost importance. Those accompanying them can wait outside. It is crucial for markets to open now. People have suffered massive losses,” said Ashok Randhawa, president of the Sarojini Nagar mini-market traders association.Also Read: Need to wait on resuming air travel: Niti Aayog memberThe Lajpat Nagar traders’ association too has held meetings and decided to enforce new rules for what is one of the largest and most crowded markets in the capital. “We will put up an SOP at the shops. No one will be allowed without being checked by thermal scanner. Also in shops that measure less than 100 sq m, we will not allow more than two customers at one time,” said Ashwani Marwah, general secretary of the association.Health experts said reopening markets is important and necessary but the responsibility to ensure that Covid-19 does not spread falls on shoppers as well as shopkeepers.Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at the Safdarjung Hospital, said all shoppers must wear masks before going to the market. “People have to behave responsibly. If one has a sore throat, fever or any type of symptoms, they must avoid going to the market. People must change their lifestyle. They must visit the markets only if it is absolutely necessary. Contrary to what many believe, markets are low-risk areas like an OPD in a hospital.”A senior police official, asking not to be named, said the Delhi Police is also likely to book fewer people over social distancing violations from May 18 in case the government decides on scaling down restrictions. This is because enforcing social distancing is likely to take up a disproportionate amount of resources, this person added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-wants-to-restart-life-from-monday-with-social-distance/story-NpgljgjVcMHvGg4XDociUI.html

16-05-2020||Gurugram||Inability to pay rent, no assurance of work forces migrants to leave||The inability to pay rent and no assurance of work are the primary reasons migrant workers are leaving for their home states. A majority of the migrant labourers working in industries and other allied sectors, who stay in the city’s urban villages and unauthorised colonies are under pressure to pay rent and electricity bills or vacate the premises. In some instances, landlords are seeking interest on the delay in payment of rent, which ranges from ₹2,000 to ₹4,000 for a single room, city-based trade union leaders said.Of the 4 to 5 lakh construction workers in the city, around 70% have already left for home and the remaining are also looking for ways to leave, the trade union leaders said. The pressure to pay rent is such that migrant workers are slipping out of villages in the dead of the night to evade their landlords, some have shifted to their relatives’ houses and others have locked the rooms and simply left without their luggage. “I am a widow and am raising two children by myself. I don’t have a source of income since the lockdown has begun. I was not able to pay the rent of ₹2,200 to my landlord in Vishnu Garden and so was forced to shift with my sister,” Lakshmi Devi, who hails from Pilibhit in Uttar Pradesh, said.The company where Devi and many others like her worked paid their salary for the seven to eight days she worked in March. After that, she has been jobless and now depends on her relatives for survival. While Devi has a family to take care of her, Mushtaq Alam and his friends, who stayed in a large room in Nathupur village, had to leave it early Friday after their landowner refused to defer the rent. His relatives in Bihar, who were touch with trade union leaders in the city, also got worried when the group did not respond to repeated phone calls and messages. “Most of the migrant workers are worried and their relatives are also calling us for help. With no work, the labourers are bound to go home,” Rajender Saroha, joint secretary, Bhawan Nirman Kamgaar Union, said.Another group of workers from Dundahera, who left for their village in western UP, said that nine of them stayed in a single room paying ₹1,000 per head. “Living locked inside a room had become difficult. Our financial condition became precarious so we chose to leave,” Nayeem, a tailor, who worked in Udyog Vihar, said.Most migrant labourers are feeling desperate. Yogesh Ram, a rickshaw-puller started his journey with two relatives on a rickshaw and had reached Agra by 4pm on Friday. “We left on Thursday morning as there was no money to pay the rent. It will take us six to seven days to reach Agra,” he said, adding that people along the route were helping them with food and water and the police were not troubling them.The mass migration of workers, the trade union leaders said, is continuing because there are inadequate housing facilities for labour and they are getting little help from authorities and industries. “The consequences of this mass migration are going to be very negative on the economy as the workers are unlikely to return before they feel safe again,” he said. A district administration spokesman said that the authorities were focussing on ensuring adequate food and essential material to migrants who continue to stay in the city. “We are also taking all steps to ensure that those who want to return are provided all kinds of help and those who want to leave face no problems in reaching their home states,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/inability-to-pay-rent-no-assurance-of-work-forces-migrants-to-leave/story-PAPrPPDYoQHZhoFNy8819J.html

16-05-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: 54 officials of MCG tested for coronavirus||At least 54 officials of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) were tested for coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on Friday.All the 54 officials who were tested belong to MCG’s Zone 3. MCG joint commissioner Hariom Attri said demands were made by officials, especially those working in the containment zones and involved in food distribution to migrant workers and other essential services, to get them tested for the infection. Attri said the officials felt they might have been negligent with wearing masks and gloves on a few occasions while being on duty and, therefore, requested for a test. “Many of our workers felt that they initially did not take the implications of Covid-19 too seriously and did not practice adequate safety measures. In addition, a large number of workers were deployed in the containment zones involved in food distribution and other essential services, who felt the need to get themselves tested as a precautionary measure. Hence, we have extended the option to all our workers to get themselves tested for Covid-19,” said Attri, adding that he too got himself tested for the virus along with many other staff members in MCG’s Zone 3 office in Sector 42. Those working in the MCG’s central store, where all protective equipment and items related to the pandemic are stored, were also tested, along with those engaged in containment zones and distribution of food.Officials said that the MCG has made it optional for all its workers to get themselves tested for the virus across all its four zones, with the testing process commencing with MCG’s Zone 3 on Friday. Ashish Singla, chief medical officer(CMO), MCG, further said that all sanitation workers working in containment zones and its buffer zones would also be tested for the virus, with one batch of 50 sanitation workers each to be tested on alternate days.“Sanitation workers have been working in close proximity to areas where coronavirus cases have been confirmed. As a precautionary measure, we want to ensure all the workers are tested and can subsequently continue to work in containment zones and other areas of the city with adequate safety equipment,” said Singla.Around 1,500 sanitation workers are estimated to be working in the city’s 35 containment zones and buffers zones, said Singla.Singla said that a batch of 50 sanitation workers was tested for coronavirus on Thursday at the MCG’s Sector 39 office from where its health branch operates, with the next batch of 50 workers scheduled to be tested on Saturday. He said the test results of the workers will take around 48 hours to process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/54-officials-of-mcg-tested-for-covid-19/story-9LpPlxW86YjT4fXgA6jy7H.html
16-05-2020||Noida||UP Roadways conducts viability study to decide taxi, bus service fare from IGI airport||The Uttar Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (UPSRTC) is conducting a viability study on fare structure of buses and taxis in different districts in order to finalise the price structure of chartered bus and taxi services proposed to ferry commuters from Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport to Noida, Ghaziabad and other districts.Raj Shekhar, UPSRTC managing director, said that the committee has not submitted its report yet. “The committee is conducting a detailed study and most likely will submit a report on Saturday. Different districts have different fare structures and Noida and Ghaziabad’s fare will be different from Lucknow and Moradabad. The committee is also conducting region-wise study to finalise the fare structure from Delhi airport to Noida, Ghaziabad and other districts,” he said.The UPSRTC has over 10,000 buses and some taxis in different districts. “We are also studying about the demand and supply from the airport. If the passengers are few, then it will be difficult for UP Roadways to run buses and taxis to distant places,” he said. The corporation is also getting feedbacks and suggestions from private taxi and bus operators for the proposed service. “Their suggestions will be incorporated in finalization of the fare structure,” Shekhar said.The UP roadways is also exploring the option of empowering local district administration to engage private taxi operators as per local demand. Shekhar said that the taxis of the UP roadways are reserved for protocol services. “The Central government may announce a lockdown extension and issue some guidelines soon. We will finalise our move accordingly,” he said.The UPSRTC had faced criticism after it issued a letter on May 9 to the corporation’s regional managers in Noida and Ghaziabad, informing them that they will facilitate travel of residents — brought back from foreign countries under the Vande Bharat Mission — from Delhi airport to Noida and Ghaziabad and other nearby areas and charge Rs 10,000 for taxi for up to 250km radius, and Rs 1,000 per seat in a bus for commuting 100km. People in Noida and Ghaziabad had criticized the move as the two district share boundary with Delhi. On Thursday, the corporation formed a three-member committee to review the order and submit recommendations to revise the fare structure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/up-roadways-conducts-viability-study-to-decide-taxi-bus-service-fare-from-igi-airport/story-9XvxI2SLtTxahfjfnCI0HL.html
16-05-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram health department forms committee to audit Covid-19 deaths||The Gurugram administration has constituted a Covid-19 Death Audit Committee (CDAC) to review deaths arising from the coronavirus disease. Several states have such committees, which follow the Indian Council of Medical Research’s guidelines on recording Covid-19 deaths. In Gurugram, as per government records no Covid-19 death has been reported.Deaths have, however, been reported in a few private hospitals of the city where Covid-19 patients from different states were admitted. Health officials say these deaths have been reported in the respective states to which thje deceased belonged. As these patients were undergoing treatment in Gurugram when they succumbed to the disease, the audit committee will review these cases.“Following the state government’s guidelines, we will analyse sequence of events leading to death, conditions antecedent to the immediate cause of the death, onset of the disease, the treatment protocol followed among others. It will help us to understand the treatment requirement and plan management strategies,” said Dr Jaswant Singh Punia, chief medical officer, who will be the chairperson of the district committee.The other members of the committee will be a member of the rapid response team, a general physician or a respiratory medicine specialist, a microbiologist or pathologist, the district immunization officer and a representative of the deputy commissioner. It will also include representative of the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Indian Medical Association (IMA) . According to an order of the Haryana government released on Wednesday, each district in the state will have to form such a committee. In Haryana, 13 Covid-19 deaths have reported, with Faridabad having the highest number deaths, five. Three deaths have been reported in Panipat, two in Ambala, one each in Rohtak, Sonepat and Karnal.The team will study all the reports, records, and case sheets of the deceased .Punia said it will be writing to all private hospitals where Covid-19 patients from Haryana or other states underwent treatment. The committee will have to submit the report within 72 hours of death.In Gurugram, earlier this week two Covid-19 deaths were reported in Civil hospital, sector 10. The health department, however, said the deceased were from Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal were included in the lists maintained by those states.The death of a resident of Delhi’s Kapashera in Civil Hospital, has been included in the Delhi list, the department added. A senior stats government official said that Haryana has included in its Covid-19 death toll, cases where the deaths are due to a comorbidity. ” Following the government protocol, Covid-19 deaths are counted in a district or state where the patient originally contracted the virus. Many times, patients from other districts and states are referred to big private hospitals and medical colleges.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/health-department-forms-covid-19-death-audit-committee/story-nGETrKf9y1xBjciRcyjYwO.html
16-05-2020||Noida||Greater Noida: 20 jawans discharged from hospital in 14 days||Twenty personnel from different paramilitary forces who were infected with the coronavirus while onduty were discharged from the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF) referral hospital at Lakhnawali camp in Greater Noida on Friday, 14 days after they were admitted.Surjeet Singh Deswal, the director general of Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) in his address to the discharged soldiers -- 17 from the ITBP and three from the Border Security Force (BSF), said that the soldiers proved that they can win in every field, either war at the borders or the invisible virus. “I hope that you will now spread the message that one should always be alert and fit against the enemies, be it visible on the border or invisible in form of a deadly virus like Covid-19. And, don’t forget to keep them at two-yards’ distance,” he said. Hailing the efforts by doctors and other staff of the hospital, the ITBP chief further said that they had done a remarkable job. “They are the real heroes who have been working selflessly to save others’ lives. And, that too putting their own lives into risk. It is really commendable that the hospital has developed its resources to its optimum level for the best treatment of the Covid-19 positive CAPF personnel among all 32 CAPF hospitals in India,” he said.On the other 163 Covid-19 positive patients at the hospital, Deswal said that they were all asymptomatic. “After the mandatory quarantine period, they all will come out of the hospital, with the same zeal and vigour they had before being admitted here. The hospital is the biggest and first-of-its-kind in the CAPFs and it has state-of-the-art equipment and treatment facilities for the patients,” he said.He later met the team of doctors, led by IG (medical) Dr Dinesh Chandra Dimri and thanked them for their services and support. Earlier, outlining the features of this hospital, Additional DG (Medical) Dr Mukesh Saxena said that the hospital has a modern pathology lab, radiology department, operation theatre including different specialised. “This hospital has best medical facilities in the lines of super specialty Hospitals for the CAPF personnel. senior specialist doctors of the CAPFs serve here. Facility of telemedicine is also available from here. For the Covid-19 patients, we have introduced robotic trays, which deliver foods and medicines to them at in their respective units,” he said. Designated as Covid-19 hospital for different para military forces, including Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), Border Security Force (BSF), Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), Seema Sashatra Bal (SSB), Assam Rifles and National Security Guards (NSG), this 200-bedded hospital had 183 patients.

16-05-2020||Kolkata||Migrant nurses leaving Bengal for safety; private hospitals face manpower shortage||Triggering a staff shortage at private hospitals in West Bengal where the Covid-19 pandemic is spiking, nurses from other states are leaving for home, citing risk of getting infected. Of the 68 hospitals dedicated to treatment of Covid-19 patients in West Bengal, 52 are private institutions. Two doctors, including a senior state health department official, have died of the disease in the state so far, while more than 160 doctors, nurses and hospital staff have been infected. As many as 185 nurses from Manipur alone left for home during the weekend, HT found from official documents. Hundreds more from Tripura, Odisha and Kerala are also preparing to leave.HT accessed a document issued by the Manipur government on May 9, which include transit clearance for 185 nurses and 132 other Manipur citizens and travel permits for 31 buses and cars all of which are registered in West Bengal. The vehicles travelled through Assam and Nagaland. The documents were signed by Rehanuddin Choudhury, joint secretary (home), Manipur.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicManipur chief minister Nongthombam Biren Singh has said all Manipuris would be brought home. His government has arranged for trains and buses to carry patients, labourers and students.Right now only a small number of non-Covid patients are admitted at hospitals and non-emergency procedures have been kept on hold. The scenario will drastically change once the lockdown is over, the authorities said.WATCH| ‘Bengal needs 105 shramik trains a day’: Piyush Goyal slams Mamata govt“Of the 600 nurses at our south Kolkata superspecialty hospital, more than 60 per cent, ie 360 nurses, are from other states. 70 of them from Manipur have already left. This is a serious situation,” said Dr Alok Roy, chairman of Medica, a group that has eight other hospitals, five of which are in Jharkhand, Odisha, Bihar and Assam. At AMRI Hospitals - a well-known chain engaged in treating Covid-19 patients – at least 60 per cent of the 900 nurses at its three units in Kolkata hail from the North-East, Odisha, Kerala and Karnataka. Some from the North-East have already left while others have told the management that they will leave once the lockdown is over. Bengal’s first Covid-19 death took place at AMRI’s Salt Lake unit. The health department functionary also died here.“Many nurses from Manipur have left. We are counselling nurses from Tripura and Odisha, asking them not to leave. We have asked our human resource departments to go on an aggressive recruitment drive in Kerala and Karnataka,” said Rupak Barua, CEO, AMRI Hospitals and chairman of the healthcare sub-committee of Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), east zone. “Since the pandemic has had very little effect in the North-East, nurses from the region probably feel it is safer to be at home,” Barua added.Also Read: Kolkata: Buses and taxis likely to hit the roads; maintaining social distancing could be a challengeTill Thursday, Tripura recorded only 154 cases and no deaths while Manipur had only three cases and no deaths. In comparison, Bengal registered 2377 cases and 151 deaths.“Some nurses claimed that hospitals in their states have offered to pay Rs 1000 a day in addition to reimbursement of daily expenses. This should be a great offer as they will be paid more while getting to live with their families,” said an official at a private hospital in Kolkata. “While a few nurses from Tripura resigned, most simply left without saying a word,” he added.“Shortage of nursing staff is a perennial problem in Bengal because there are not many training colleges. We hire people from the North-East, Odisha and Kerala. In recent years, Karnataka has been added to the list, as many training colleges have come up there,” said Barua. On an average, no less than 60 per cent of the nurses employed at big private hospitals in Bengal come from other states.Since state government hospitals employ local residents only and absorb the bulk of the students graduating from nursing schools, private hospitals employ migrants in large numbers.Apollo hospital said it did not face this situation till Thursday. “We have one thousand nurses and a sizeable chunk are from other states. However, only four nurses from Manipur have so far left,” said a spokesperson. Apollo’s East Zone CEO, Rana Dasgupta added that the hospital was “not facing any problem so far.” The authorities at some private hospitals in Kolkata said that some nurses from Kerala - a large chunk of this migrant workforce- were also planning to leave, but Medica group chairman Alok Roy felt this may not happen, because nurses from Kerala had experienced more of the disease across the country, and were not likely to panic. There is no centralised data on the number of migrant nurses working at private hospitals and clinics in Kolkata and rest of Bengal. “There must be thousands of them and the figures keep fluctuating, as deployment depends on demand and supply. The nurses are taken on a 2-3 year contract,” said Dr Koushik Chaki, secretary, West Bengal Doctors’ Forum, a prominent body of physicians.Dr Chaki said that frontline warriors were not getting personal protection equipment (PPE) in adequate quantity either. On Monday, the forum wrote its second letter in four days to chief secretary Rajiva Sinha, highlighting this issue. On May 5, the 400-bed multi-specialty Peerless Hospital in south Kolkata shut down operations after a number of doctors, nurses, staff members and attendants contracted Covid-19 while treating patients. In April, Chernock Hospital in the eastern fringes of Kolkata had to be shut down for the same reason. Both hospitals employ migrant nurses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/migrant-nurses-leaving-bengal-for-safety-private-hospitals-face-manpower-shortage/story-htJzRdHYup8IP713ZOObAM.html

16-05-2020||Delhi||Delhi Jal Board prepares to up water output in its summer plan||The Delhi Jal Board (DJB) on Friday launched its action plan for the year to meet the water demand of around 20 million residents of the city over the summer, especially at a time when the need to wash hands frequently has been exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic.In a statement released on Friday, DJB vice-chairperson Raghav Chadha sought to assure residents of the Capital that the state government would ensure there was no shortage of water in the city.The board has set a target of producing 925 million gallons per day (mgd) of water this summer. On an average, the DJB produces 900mgd water, with demand peaking at 1,100mg in summer months. “With the entire world under lockdown, the coronavirus pandemic has underlined the importance of water in public health and further strengthened our commitment to ensure access to potable clean drinking water and sanitation for all...DJB will work towards maintaining the water treatment plants, increasing the water supply in water-deficient areas, improving efficiency and faster disposal of complaints this summer,” Chadha said in the statement. He also said water bodies would be rejuvenated to help recharge groundwater systems and help combat shortages. “A total of 155 existing water bodies will be rejuvenated. Tenders for 59 have been announced, out of which work for 22 has already been awarded,” the statement said.Additionally, new lakes are being created at Dwarka, Timarpur, Rohini, Nilothi, Pappan Kalan and Satpula, it said. The DJB vice-chairman also listed several initiatives being taken to ensure enough water supply during this period, including the completion of four underground reservoirs (UGRs), at west Kamal Vihar, Sonia Vihar, Mundka and Mahipalpur, to cater to the west and central Delhi areas. Besides, 1,077 water tankers have been deployed at 87,308 locations in areas such as unauthorised colonies and slum clusters, which do not have piped connections. Further, 254 tube-wells, 117 Water ATMs and e-piaos (water kiosks) have been installed in water-deficient areas. “A total of 17 water testing laboratories, including eight zonal labs, have been upgraded to ensure adequate surveillance of potable water quality to ensure that it meets prescribed drinking water standards as per the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS),” the DJB statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/as-part-of-djb-s-summer-plan-1k-water-rankers-upping-water-production/story-R3cEBilEe3PJLeqZvPtGsJ.html
16-05-2020||Delhi||Quarantined Delhi woman doctor returns home to neighbour’s abuse||A 27-year-old woman doctor on Covid-19 duty, who contracted the virus while treating patients at a government hospital in north Delhi, was allegedly humiliated, intimidated and sexual harassed by her neighbour, who even locked her in her south Delhi flat in Vasant Kunj, when she returned home from an isolation facility on Wednesday.On Thursday, a case of wrongful restraint and sexual harassment under sections 342 and 509 of the Indian Penal Code was registered against the neighbour at the Vasant Kunj South police station on the doctor’s complaint, said deputy commissioner of police (southwest) Devender Arya.“We have started the probe into the case and it’s in the preliminary stage. The neighbour will be asked to join the investigation. Further action will be taken accordingly,” said a senior police officer who asked not to be named. The doctor could not be reached her comment and repeated calls and text messages to her cellphone numbers went unanswered.Since a sexual harassment charge is included in the case, the doctor’s name and other details that can reveal her identity have been withheld by the police.The doctor said in her complaint that after being discharged from the isolation centre, she returned home on Wednesday. Around 4.30pm, her neighbour on the ground floor came to her the first floor flat and began screaming and hurling abuses at her, saying she was Covid-19 positive and could not stay there.“...even after explaining to him that I have two confirmed negative test reports and have been satisfactorily discharged from the isolation centre, he did not stop screaming at me,” the doctoradded in the complaint.The doctor alleged that when she asked him to talk to the president of the residents’ welfare association (RWA), the neighbour latched her door from outside and shouted, “I will see how you step out and will make sure you leave this place. Call whoever you want to.”The RWA president said the doctor informed her about the matter and she in turn alerted the Vasant Kunj South’s station house officer (SHO), who sent a beat officer.The neighbour said he has apologised to the doctor and the police for his “aggressive behaviour”. He claimed that he was unaware that the doctor had been on Covid-19 duty and objected only because she had returned home after just a week in quarantine.“The doctor was shifted to the quarantine facility on May 6. I was surprised when she returned on May 13 because as per my knowledge, a Covid patient is quarantined for at least 14 days. I was concerned for my wife and children’s safety, so I protested. Later, I realised my mistake and apologised to her,” he said over phone.The RWA president, however, said the neighbour was aware of what was happening. A WhatsApp group was created to post updates from the day the doctor tested positive for the virus, the president added. She said that after the doctor tested positive, authorities recommended a home quarantine as is usually done in the case of mild cases.“But we knew that many residents would object to that. So the authorities were requested to shift her to an isolation facility. The doctor also willingly shifted herself there. But neighbours humiliating her and not allowing her to live in her own house even after she has recovered from the disease is not justified,” the RWA president said.On April 22, in the backdrop of persistent attacks on health care workers in the front line of the battle against Covid-19, the Centre approved an ordinance to make such attacks a cognisable and non-bailable offence, expedite the investigation; imprison those convicted by up to seven years; and impose stringent penalties on vandalism and damage to property.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/woman-doctor-released-from-quarantine-returns-home-to-abuse-sexual-harassment-from-neighbour/story-VLhAsI5f4BPMGiUCDmRfRN.html
16-05-2020||Delhi||From selfie sticks to thermal scanner headgear: Delhi Police try to keep Covid-19 away||A magnifying glass attached to a selfie stick that can help read documents from a safe distance to a headgear that can scan the temperatures of multiple people from 10 metres way, Delhi Police are using innovative ways to keep its personnel from contracting Covid-19, the viral disease that has killed one policeman and infected at least 110 others in the Capital. The police are also using hands-free water taps, foot-operated soap dispensers and automatic temperature scanners -- some of which are being sourced from private firms while some others being put together by the police personnel themselves. The police force has been playing a critical part in enforcing the national lockdown norms, manning entries in containment zones, helping transport people and general patients and also maintaining law and order, which leaves them vulnerable to contracting coronavirus infection. Last month, the Chandni Mahal police station had to be sealed after eight police personnel deployed there had tested positive. Later, nine personnel from the Sultanpuri police station in outer Delhi too had tested positive. The virus has spared officers of no rank: On Tuesday, an IPS officer and his two staffers had tested positive. Senior police officers said while some of these devices are already being employed by the personnel deployed on the ground, trials continue on some others. The idea is to minimise contact while performing our duties and staying safe, the officer said. SELFIE STICKThe first of these improvisions is a selfie stick that has been turned into a “document-checking equipment”. “We fixed a magnifying glass at the end of the stick so that the policemen at pickets can read documents presented by motorists without having to approach the person or touch the documents. We attached an LED light to make it handy even at nights,” said Atul Kumar Thakur, deputy commissioner of police (South). The improvisation was made by Rahul Gupta, a probationary Indian Police Service officer and an alumni of IIT Delhi. After top police officers inspected the operation of the device, about 50 such equipments were readied and distributed to other police districts, the South DCP said. SCANNER HEADGEARIn West Delhi, the police partnered with a private firm to prepare a headgear, similar to a helmet, on which a thermal scanner has been fitted which, the police officers claim, can measure the temperatures of multiple people at a time.“This device can scan the temperatures from as far as 10 metres, negating the need for the police to approach the public. We have conducted a trial run at a picket in Rajouri Garden. If successful, it can be deployed at supermarkets, mandis and hospitals,” said Deepak Purohit, DCP (West).Sagar Naugriya, the founder of Indian Robotics Solutions, which has developed the headgear, said it could scan the temperatures of multiple people at once. “If 10 people are captured in the frame of the headgear, it can scan the temperature of each person. It takes about four seconds to test each person’s temperature. The live images can be shared or sent to a centralised control centre,” said Naugriya.EXPERTS NOT IMPRESSEDJugal Kishore, director and professor of community medicine at Safdarajang Hospital, said the accuracy of the data provided by the headgear should be put to stringent tests before pressing it in service. He said the headgear will also factor in the temperature of the local environment and the readings has to be precise. “Similar devices used at hospitals haven’t been really effective,” Kishore said.Prashant Pillai, co-founder of the robotic firm, agreed with the doctor. He said that considering this factor, the mean temperature of a group of people being scanned will be taken first. “If there is deviation of say more than one degree Fahrenheit in any person in that group, apart from those who already have higher temperatures than the body temperature, they’ll be referred for a secondary examination.“The temperature that our device captures is the elevated body temperature, which is the temperature of the skin. Whereas, doctors test the body temperature. So, a secondary test will be required for those with a high variation from the mean temperature,” said Pillai. The South district police too are working on an unmanned, static thermal scanner to be installed at police stations. “It will record and store the temperatures of every personnel and visitor arriving at the police stations. It should be ready and in service in a day or two,” DCP Thakur said. TOUCH-FREE SOAP, WATERThe police in Sangam Vihar sub-division have devised a simple system by which anyone visiting the police station can use their feet to press a spring below a water tank to turn on the tap, and then a similar spring on another side to dispense liquid soap.“This device works on the hydraulic principle to release water and soap without having to use hands,” said Sudhans Dhama, assistant commissioner of police (Sangam Vihar). Dhama, who devised this system, is an electronic engineering graduate from BITS-Pilani. In many police stations, the police have also installed standalone hands-free soap dispensers that can be operated by foot .Doctor Kishore found these “non-touch techniques” more useful. “Such techniques must be developed more and used more widely,” he said. Across districts, the police are already extensively using drones to keep a watch on neighbourhoods from a safe distance. Some have gone a step ahead to improvise these drones. The Central and South police districts, for example, carry out live announcements using the drone, to the extent of singling out individuals based on the colour of their dresses..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/from-selfie-sticks-to-thermal-scanner-headgear-delhi-police-try-to-keep-covid-away/story-CMSmIO5fxh5BsXY0thehZO.html
16-05-2020||Noida||Unemployment forces low income groups to switch to selling essential items||With many losing jobs amid the ongoing lockdown, those in lower income groups are switching professions and taking up delivery of essential items.Even though state governments have given certain relaxations in lockdown norms since May 3 so that industries and construction activities can resume work, lower income groups continue to struggle to find work.“I used to work as a rickshaw puller while my wife worked at a construction site. When the lockdown started, someone told us that this coronavirus crisis will not end soon. So with the last of our money we bought vegetables and fruits from the Sector 88 market. I used my rickshaw to ferry the goods and we sold the produce on the roadside in Sector 75,” Manoj, who hails from Jharkhand, said.The family feels that their decision to switch to essential service delivery was a good one. “Many of our neighbours used to work at construction sites and are struggling to survive. Their contractors have also not helped them out. We at least have enough to feed ourselves and our three children,” Manoj said.District officials say small roadside businesses, rickshaw pullers and other daily wage earners are the worst affected by the economic crisis brought about by the lockdown.“Earlier my three children used to help out at our tea stall in Sector 18. But our shop has been closed for almost two months now. We began to run out of money and had to borrow ration from people we knew in Sector 27. But last week, one of my sons got a job at a department store in Atta. He is earning ₹200 per day and that is helpful to us. We don’t think that we will be able to go back to running our shop so my husband has also started looking for work,” Sarita, who lives with her family in Atta area, said.The Noida authority had also roped in vendors to supply vegetables, fruits and groceries to containment zones. With reduced pedestrian movement, some of the existing vendors have also had to change their routine.“Till last month, we used to have our fruit and vegetables stall near where we live in Sorkha village. But now, in order to sell more products, we walk an additional one or two kilometres to either Sector 74 or 76 where there are high-rises and thus more customers. Whatever is left, we sell that in Sorkha,” another vegetable vendor, who did not wish to be named, said.Even sectors and high-rises had roped in more vendors in March itself so that residents don’t venture out.“When the lockdown started, there was hardly any vegetable vendor coming to our area. Now we have more than 10-15 fruit and vegetable sellers coming in daily. Most of them are from the nearby Hoshiyarpur village. There were earlier employed as mechanics, etc. There was a man who owned a small tent business. He has now set up two tables, covered it with a tent and started selling fruits,” Sanjeev Kumar, president, Sector 51 residents welfare association, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/unemployment-forces-low-income-groups-to-switch-to-selling-essential-items/story-YE0tzIZ5QjWKLuNBoNvFMN.html
16-05-2020||Delhi||Delhi metro restart plan does away with tokens, alternate seats to be empty||The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) is in the process of finalising protocols for passenger movement at its stations and inside its trains. The protocols are being drawn up with focus on social distancing — essential to contain the spread of Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) — once the Centre gives its nod for public transport to operate in the fourth phase of the lockdown, which will begin Monday.Among other norms, the new rules being drawn up will likely include complete cashless transactions at ticketing counters, earmarking designated spots for passengers to stand while waiting for trains or at ticketing counters, use of face masks and Aarogya Setu mobile application and separate entry and exit points to the station premises, said an official.These measures, which are under consideration and yet to be finalised, are based on guidelines provided by the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs (HUA) to all metro corporations in the country for drafting standard operating procedures (SOPs).Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicOnce metro operations resume, a senior official said Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) plans to do away with the token system and all transactions at ticketing counter will be completely cashless. “Chances of the spread of the infection increases while using tokens,” added the official.The Delhi Metro has already started putting markers on station floors and platforms to earmark space for passengers while waiting at stations or counters. It has also put up stickers on seats inside the trains, with alternate seats having to be left vacant.“DMRC is taking up the necessary cleaning inside the trains and indoor areas of stations such as entrance lobbies, corridors, staircases, escalators, elevators, and the security area. Other necessary logistical arrangements, such as provision of hand sanitisation/thermal screening at stations and installation of social distancing related signages are also being put in place,” said Anuj Dayal, executive director, DMRC.Also Read: Delhi wants to restart life from Monday — with social distanceThe Central Road Research Institute (CRRI) recently drafted guidelines, which were shared with all state governments and transport agencies, for public transport to operate while ensuring social distancing norms. Mukti Advani, principal scientist, transport planning at CSIR-CRRI, said, “Online ticketing system should be encouraged and at least 80% of tickets should be booked online. It is good the Delhi Metro is earmarking spots on platforms. Efforts have to be made to ensure there is no crowding outside the stations. We had also recommended that passengers sit on alternate seats.”The number of passengers travelling per train will drop sharply due to measures proposed to ensure social distancing. Currently, close to 1,800 people travel on a six-coach train. With passengers allowed to sit on alternate seats, the passenger-carrying capacity of the trains is likely to drop to 300-500, said the Delhi Metro official.Dayal said, “The decision to resume Metro rail services in Delhi-NCR will be taken by the government, after which the detailed protocol will be shared with the public.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/metro-restart-plan-does-away-with-tokens-alternate-seats-to-be-empty/story-dj7wI0JfF142Ra2pV22qEO.html

16-05-2020||Delhi||Delhi to await Centre guidelines before taking call on liquor stores, home deliveries||The Delhi excise department will take a call on allowing private liquor shops to open, and provisions for its home delivery only after the central government issues fresh guidelines on restrictions and relaxations from May 18, senior government officials said on Friday. On the same day, the Delhi high court refused an interim stay on the 70% ‘Special Corona Fee’ charged on liquor in the city, but asked the state government for a response on a bunch of pleas challenging the imposition of the cess.The Delhi government had notified the special cess on May 4, imposing the tax on the MRP of any brand of liquor sold in the city.The high court had, on Thursday, asked the Delhi government to decide on the online sale and home delivery of liquor by May 15 (Friday). The government assured the court that it would decide the same by the date mandated.Liquor stores in many parts of the country, including Delhi, witnessed unruly crowds and serpentine queues, soon after lockdown curbs were relaxed on May 4. “The department has decided to wait for clear guidelines from the Centre on allowing private liquor shops to open and home delivery,” a senior government official said on Friday. “These guidelines are expected to be announced in a day or two,” the official said.Alcohol sales account for 14.1% of Delhi’s total revenue projections for 2020-21.Currently, the ministry of home affairs guidelines applicable for the lockdown period till May 17 limits e-commerce transactions to essentials (which does not include liquor) in red zones (all 11 revenue districts in the Capital).The Supreme Court, however, had advised states last week to look into the possibility of online sale and delivery of liquor. So far, several states have started such an initiative, including Punjab, Chhattisgarh and West Bengal. The Delhi government introduced e-tokens for customers, to cut down on the long queues.In Delhi, the excise department met thrice on the issue last week, one including finance minister Manish Sisodia. The government had also approached a private technology outsourcing company seeking help to develop a weblink and a mobile application but later put the plan on hold, a senior government official.The government has drafted a standard operating procedure on home delivery of liquor but it awaits approval of senior officials. Corona fee One of the petitions in the high court, filed by advocate Lalit Valecha, said the ‘special corona fee’ imposed by the Delhi government upon the sale of liquor is in excess of what has been authorised by law and accordingly it is being collected arbitrarily.Two other pleas called the cess a violation of the Constitution. The court said it will now hear the matter on May 29.Delhi has 864 liquor shops but only around 10% of them have been functional for the last 12 days, collectively recording sales of around ₹ 9.33 crore per day, excise department records showed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-to-await-centre-guidelines-before-taking-call-on-liquor-stores-home-deliveries/story-NF4611vehkQwjQlCieYIBI.html

The court’s direction came after the Delhi government’s additional standing counsel Gautam Narayan told the bench that the information provided by the government of India about the number of PPE kits and N-95 masks does not match with the log book of the department of health, government of NCT.On the last date, additional solicitor general, Maninder Kaur Acharya, appearing for the Centre, had informed the court that 3,79,429 N-95 masks and 1,16,890 PPE kits had been given to the Delhi government .

16-05-2020||Patna||Nitish pitches for zone-wise testing for migrants as cases cross 1,000||After issuing directives for ramping up testing in view of lakhs of migrant workers returning home, Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar Thursday directed officials to work out a zone-wise strategy to ensure optimal and targeted utilisation of the existing limited resources.In the last one week, Bihar has added 60-65 patients on an average everyday. From 556 Covid-19 positive cases on May 8, the number has touched 1,000 May 15 morning, adding 444 new cases in just seven days. The doubling period of positive cases in the state has come down to just 8.5 days, while it is 12.5 nationwide, though officials say it is due to sudden inflow of migrants and increased testing.As per statistics released by Sanjay Kumar, principal secretary (health) on Friday, three states, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Delhi, accounted for 282 of the 358 migrants testing positive between May 4 and 15, which comes to 79% of the total. “The data in the third phase of lockdown shows that roughly around 7% of the returning migrants tested after reaching Bihar turned out to be positive, as most of them are coming from red zones. This is the fear Bihar always had. The CM has categorically stated that testing should be increased and facilities developed across all districts to track positive cases early for isolation and treatment to prevent spread,” said an official.However, with barely around 2,000 samples getting tested in Bihar everyday, the situation is far from satisfactory. During a review meeting with top officials, Kumar said the number of migrants would only increase in the coming days and therefore it was important to focus on those coming from vulnerable pockets and red zone areas, as per a press statement issued by the Bihar government late Thursday evening.“There should be some zone-wise strategy for testing as well as putting them under quarantine, as people are coming from different zones, where the situation is different,” he said.Bulk of the migrants reaching Bihar are from worst-affected Maharashtra, Gujarat, Delhi, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, while there are others spread across various other states, including Kerala, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh etc.With another three-lakh migrants estimated to reach Bihar by special trains in the next one week, Kumar said testing facility must be started in all the districts without delay. Earlier, Kumar had said that the random testing In the state would not be enough anymore and the testing capacity must be increased to 10,000 per day.The Bihar government has already announced that 15 TrueNat machines would be installed at 13 district hospitals in the state, while 25 more are in pipeline. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) had on April 10 validated the usage of TrueNat, a diagnostic machine for testing test drug-resistant tuberculosis, for Covid-19 tests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/nitish-pitches-for-zone-wise-testing-for-migrants-as-cases-cross-1-000/story-JvkYQSBwN5DfCOwvUKLGXI.html
16-05-2020||Pune||Industries in Pune now short-staffed, but expects worse post-monsoon||With a large number of migrant labourers leaving Pune for their home, industries and shops that are on the verge of re-opening their businesses are facing some tough questions. However, a section of business-owners believe they’ll be able to pull off without the labourers since only 33 per cent staff are allowed due to the restrictions.The real challenge for industries will begin after the monsoon, believes J P Shroff, labour welfare committee chairman at Confederation of Real Estate Developers Associations of India (Credai) said.“Basically, the real estate will not feel so much of the pinch for starting pre-monsoon works which need minimum labour and during monsoon, the work slows down but there is a definite slowdown in the speed of work by 10 to 15 per cent. The real problem will start post-monsoon if the labour doesn’t come back, hence Credai members have taken special care to see that the labourers are enticed to come back by providing advances, return tickets and guarantee of work,” Shroff said.But according to Credai, the developers will also have a gestation period of 15 days to make their site functional and up to mark to meet the new Covid-19 norms.“Migratory labour generally go back home during May and June, to do their regular routine things. Once that is done, they start coming back from July to August. Normally, 30 to 40 per cent migratory labour go back but this year, there is a rise with 50 to 60 per cent going back, which leads to a shortage of 20 per cent of the labour,” Shroff said.After the government of Maharashtra notification, some companies in the Ranjangaon area in rural Pune opened up with 33 per cent staff. On Friday, the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation gave a nod to open businesses in the area.According to the confederation of Indian industry (CII), the companies are currently managing operations due to a lesser load and demand, which is not letting labour shortage being felt immediately.“However, as things improve and factories and establishments begin in full swing, labour shortages shall be felt and shall be a deterrent towards scaling up, if the situation of migration and shortage persists, said Alakesh Roy, chairman, CII Pune zonal council and managing director Zamil steel buildings India.According to Roy, the current shortages if any are being taken care of, but the fact that not all industries have started and labourers are moving across sectors for jobs and livelihood is a sign of worry.CII Pune has been working with all members and non-members, to raise matters with governments at the district, state and national level for an effective resolution.“Social distancing norms were always followed by the very aspect of ergonomics, while at work. Special attention towards social distancing is now being ensured while during breaks for food and rest time and education is being provided to all employees. The transportation of employees is also being done at a reduced capacity of vehicles and other modes of transport. The companies are also avoiding overlapping shifts as of now to prevent crowding during shift switches,” Roy said.Meanwhile, the Mahratta chamber of commerce, industries and agriculture (MCCIA) is trying to work as a bridge between the industry and local administration in solving the soon to hit labour shortage, according to Prashant Girbane, director-general, MCCIA. “Many migrant labourers have now travelled back home out of state and also within the state. There are also constraints on movements within the district and city given the level of the lockdown being implemented by the local authorities. While the reasons are understandable, it is posing many problems for industries that are already facing the brunt of the economic downturn. On one hand, we advise our colleagues in the industry to implement stricter health and safety measures, on the other, we request city administration to release labour movement constraints outside containment zones,” Girbane said. Deepak Garg, vice-chairman, CII Pune zonal council and managing director at Sany group believes labour shortage won’t have a big impact at present as only 33 per cent manpower is allowed. “Companies who have employed from Maharashtra and specifically Pune, the impact will be lesser. Post lockdown 3.0, some of the labour who has moved to their native places within Maharashtra has been returning back to Pune with appropriate approvals from government authorities. The Maharashtra government is currently allowing employees to return back to their work city by their private vehicles. For companies employing labour from northern states, they will face issues. But this is also a good opportunity to provide employment for locals,” Garg said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/industries-stare-at-labour-shortage-real-crisis-post-monsoon/story-XScLbc8JzKzzFij879fpnO.html

No person should be allowed to enter the premises without wearing the face covers. Use of touch-gesture based bio-metric attendance (thumbprint/ keypad) is prohibited,” he said.The commissioner advised the industry to use the Aarogya Setu mobile application and the PCMC Smart Sarathi Mobile Application to get in touch with the civic body for their needs and permissions. Specific guidelines for manufacturing/ production and the shop floor areas have advised that most of the units have to follow day shifts or a night shift when meant that the members would remain within the premises from 7 am to 7 pm.The companies would have to provide work-site mobility and transportation and create rules for any work that required workers to work with a two metre distance as well follow protocol and use sanitizers and disinfectant while sharing tools and equipment.He said every workstation and equipment should be disinfected before the start of the shift. Companies have been advised to introduce staggered lunch breaks.Pradeep Bhargava, president, MCCIA said, “ We are thankful to the government of Maharashtra and the local administration for considering our request to restart industries in PCMC. Given the number of employees (especially seniors) of PCMC-based companies who live in Pune and nearby regions, we have made requests to allow them (as long as they do not come from containment zones) to travel to their respective companies in their own vehicles, following all safety norms.14,000 applicantsSadashiv Survase, Joint Director, Industries said so far 14,000 applications for reopening of the companies have been received on the digital platform, permission.midcindia.org and only 1800 are pending for approvals. The companies have a self-declared permission which is granted only after they undertake the 23 SOPs (standard operating procedures) of Covid-19. The issue that the companies are now facing in PCMC is that of vehicle passes as only employees or staff can move using a dedicated mini bus or a bus besides private closed car.No two wheelers are allowed No decision on allowing employees from Pune to travel as yet. There were many concerns about allowing employees to travel from Pune but those are yet to be decided, the officials said. Pimpri-Chinchwad municipal commissioner Shravan Hardikar said only those employees coming from the PCMC areas would be allowed at the moment. The Maharashtra government, on May 2, allowed industries in rural parts of Pune to reopen, with companies in the MIDC areas of Ranjangaon, Chakan and Kurkumbh making special arrangements for transporting their employees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/industry-asked-to-follow-covid-19-sops-as-pcmc-allows-factories-to-open-with-33-workforce/story-dlunV35RvTum29EuugTTbI.html

In case any patient needs additional treatment then the patients could be shifted to the nearby Symbiosis hospital at Lavale and another Covid-19 hospital at Pashan.With rising patients even in the rural areas of the district, the administration is now setting up facilities at the rural areas to isolate patients who otherwise would have to be shifted to the city area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mhada-complex-turned-into-covid-19-hospital-ready-for-patients/story-FrLzAoZP61B8n2cRt8p39L.html

16-05-2020||Pune||Pune hospital conducts city’s first organ donation during lockdown||On Friday, May 15, Pune’s Ruby Hall Clinic, in liason with Sahyadri hospital, became the first hospitals in the city and the second in Maharashtra, to carry out an organ donation during the last two months of the lockdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic.With the lockdown, many hospitals had postponed or even cancelled surgeries. While recipients were unwilling to travel fearing transmission of the fatal infection, non-Covid patients were not admitted to hospitals and the number of donors had also gone down drastically.Aarti Gokhale, transplant coordinator of the Zonal Transplant Coordination Committee (ZTCC), Pune, confirmed that the organ donation was completed on May 15 at the hospital and that it was the first one in two months in the city.Dr Astrid Lobo Gajiwala, director of the regional organ and tissue transplant organisation (ROTTO), western region, said, “This would technically be the second organ donation after the lockdown was announced. On March 24 there was one transplant at Mumbai hospital. There were no organs transplanted in April and this is the first in May for the entire state.”Gokhale confirmed that this is the first for Pune since the official lockdown came into place on March 24.The hospital’s director (medical services), Dr Sanjay Pathare, said the liver was retrieved from a 49-year-old brain dead donor hailing from a village in Ahmednagar district.The patient had suffered severe head injury in a road accident on May 11 “Despite critical care management the brain damage could not be reversed and he was declared brain dead on May 14. The son expressed his willingness to donate the organ and we explained to him the complete organ donation process and assured wholehearted cooperation. The organ donation was completed on May 15 and the body handed over to the relative,” Dr. Pathare said.The organ wad retrieved at Ruby Hall and transferred to Sahyadri hospital’s Ahmednagar road branch, where a recipient was ready to receive the organ.Dr Sunil Rao, group medical director, Ruby Hall, said, ‘The recipient is a 62-year-old female suffering from liver disease.”Gokhale said since the lockdown, not a single organ transplant had been conducted in Maharashtra. Hospitals had cancelled surgeries. “While organ donation is an essential service it is not an emergency service. In normal conditions, on an average, about five-six organ donations take place a month in Maharashtra,” Gokhale said.The National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation (NOTTO) has guidelines to ensure that the transmission of the infection does not take place during the transplant process like checking the travel history, location of the recipient and also donor..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-hospital-conducts-maharashtra-s-first-organ-donation-during-lockdown/story-JNRs5zMZkqMLUKAejHHu3K.html

In the last 50 years, the district had received over 40mm rainfall during May only on four occasions.KK Gill, professor of agricultural meteorology, Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) said, the district received 70.1mm rainfall in 1977, followed by 75.8mm in 1986.After 11 years, Ludhiana recorded more than 100mm (100.2 mm) rainfall. Now after 23 years, it happened again and only within 15 days, the district recorded 41.2mm rainfall.She cited occurrence of more than normal events of western disturbances in the north-western regions for low temperatures and frequent rainfall this year.“The highest temperature recorded this month was 30 degrees Celsius, however, it started declining with the onset of western disturbances and the region experienced five rainfall events during the first fortnight itself. May recorded 66% above normal rainfall, which is 31mm,” said Gill.Below normal temperature had been witnessed since the beginning of the year and cold day conditions prevailed in the region since January.In January, which recorded 12.8mm above normal rainfall, the day temperatures were below normal by 2 degrees Celsius, while the minimum temperatures were above normal by 1 degree Celsius.February was near normal in respect of maximum temperatures but minimum temperatures were 0.6 degree Celsius above normal.“March generally witnesses transition of winter to summer conditions, however, the maximum temperatures remained below normal almost throughout the month this year. The average maximum temperature remained 2.2 degrees Celsius below normal as the month received 69mm rainfall, almost double of the normal 23.6mm,” said Gill.In April, no moderate to severe heat wave conditions prevailed as maximum temperatures remained 3 degrees Celsius below normal, said professor Gill.The weather is likely to be dry after May 15, she said, adding the condition is favourable for agricultural operations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/at-41-2mm-ludhiana-records-highest-may-rainfall-in-23-years/story-kOurEqM12vU8BI22lkdIxM.html

The owners of small-scale firms at Chakan MIDC, one of the most affected parts in Pune, now need labourers to resume their work. Mahadev Yejagar, owner of SM Laser Machine Craft company, said, “All our workers left for their native places after the lockdown was declared. Now that the government has issued relaxations to resume production, we do not have workforce to start our business. We need skilled manpower to work on heavy machineries and it would be very difficult to survive in such situations if there is no workforce.”Bappu Kale, manager, Sumaji Laser Pvt Ltd company said, “Finding skilled labour will be a big task once the lockdown opens and work resumes. Half of the workforce from Chakan MIDC has returned to their hometowns and villages due to the fear of coronavirus. The new workers who have approached us are demanding high payment.” Ramesh Rathod, vice-president of Gultekdi Industrial Estate area which is one of the oldest small scale industry units in Pune, said, “All the 40 units are shut down in our industrial estate. These units are surrounded by slums. Thirty per cent of workforce has left for their hometowns. Our request to the government is to allow us to start work with limited manpower and we will take necessary precautions.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/midc-firms-face-acute-labour-shortage/story-LWTYHxeZqiXczqxSYm5zLM.html

The exercise will be carried out to meet the rising blood requirements across city hospitals. The Janakalyan blood bank and the Sassoon blood bank are now among those who have started blood donation drives to meet the shortfall in blood in blood banks.Atul Kulkarni, director of Jankalyan Blood Bank from Pune said, “We are now planning to start blood donation drives from this weekend as per the guidelines given by the state government. All the necessary safety precautions and social distancing will be kept during these drives.”A staff from Sassoon hospital said on the condition of anonymity that there is a shortage of B positive and B negative blood groups.“Barring this, we have storage of all other blood groups. We are therefore organising special blood donation camps, and trying to get as many blood donors as possible to address this shortage. The demand for these blood groups is more from non-Covid patients. We, therefore, appeal to the public to please come forward and donate blood to help the needy patients and save their lives,” he said.The HT team contacted Sassoon hospital’s dean Dr Murlidhar Tambe with repeated calls and messages for a response on the story but there was no revert. Over the last few days, blood donation camps have been organised inside Sassoon to increase the supply of blood groups in the blood bank. Pune-based philanthropist Shantilal Muttha, founder, Bharatiya Jain Sanghatana, had initiated a statewide blood donation drive through 11 mobile van clinics that conducted a statewide blood donation drive. Through this drive, the organisation collected a total of 4,148 blood packets until May 14 from across the state. “It is unfortunate that someone died due to not getting blood in time. This is the major issue we are going to face once the lockdown ends. Thousands of surgeries that are on hold will be performed and hospitals will require blood in large quantities. We have taken blood donation camps across the state but the problem of storage of blood has emerged,” Muttha said.According to Muttha, once the storage issues are addressed his organisation will begin blood-donation camps, once again.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sassoon-kick-starts-blood-donation-drive-amid-shortages/story-jcY85SW6sDv6QxNEocrWpO.html
16-05-2020||Pune||Covid-19: Sharad Pawar seeks sops from PM for sugar industry in Maharashtra||Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) supremo Sharad Pawar has sought Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s immediate intervention to bail out the sugar industry in Maharashtra from the crisis aggravated by the Covid-19 (coronavirus) pandemic and lockdown.Pawar has demanded that Minimum Support Price (MSP ) for sugarcane farmers ranging from Rs 3,450 to Rs 3,750 with grade-wise increment and provision of a one-time grant of Rs 650 per tonne on average cane crushed during the past two years.In a letter to Modi on May 14, the former Union agriculture minister has placed five demands before the prime minister.These include the provision of funds for clearing export incentives and buffer stock expenses which have been pending since 2018-2020; provision of a one-time grant of Rs 650 per tonne on average cane crushed during the last two years; conversion of outstanding capital into short-term loan and rescheduling of all terms of loans for ten years with a moratorium of two years on the lines of Mitra Committee recommendations.Pawar has also urged the PM to introduce a policy to treat all sugar distilleries as Strategic Business Units (SBU). On a standalone basis, banks should finance ethanol projects sanctioned under interest subvention capex scheme announced by the central government in 2018, he said in his letter.The senior NCP leader also shared his letter on twitter with a remark: “Raised concerns through letter to Hon. @PMOIndia and requested his urgent intervention to bail out #sugar industry from crisis aggravated exponentially by unprecedented nationwide lockdown in the wake of pandemic #COVID19.” (sic)He also enclosed a letter from the chairman of Maharashtra State Co-operative Sugar Factories Federation Ltd pointing out that the federation has also called for some immediate relief measures.

16-05-2020||City||Stay away from spurious seeds, use varieties developed by PAU, farmers told||Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) has urged farmers to not buy spurious seeds and recommended that they only buy the seed varieties developed by the varsity PAU.He cautioned farmers against falling for unrealistic yield claims.The advisory comes in the backdrop of an agriculture department raid at a seed store, situated opposite the university’s gate number 1, found selling spurious seeds. GS Mangat, principal rice breeder and head of department of plant breeding and genetics, PAU, Ludhiana, while urging farmers not to buy seeds from unauthenticated sources, asked them to only use genuine varieties of seeds developed by PAU. Giving details, he said that PR 128 and PR 129 give optimal yield when transplanted after June 20 and provide sufficient time for paddy straw management without burning.He said that PR 128 matures in about 111 days after transplanting, while PR 129 takes about 108 days to mature after transplanting.“This period is about three weeks shorter than the duration of PUSA 44 and at par with PR 121, PR 124 and PR 114. The new varieties have potential to replace long duration varieties and help conserve water, particularly in districts where the water table is continuously declining,” said Mangat.“Both varieties are resistant to all 10 prevalent path types of bacterial blight pathogen in Punjab. The average paddy yield of PR 128 is 30.5 quintals per acre, while that of PR 129 is 30 quintals per acre. Total (milled) rice recoveries and head rice recoveries of both the varieties have been found to be at par with the popular rice varieties. Both varieties meet the out-turn ratio of raw rice fixed at 67% by the central government and are distinct from PAU 201 variety of paddy,” added Mangat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/stay-away-from-spurious-seeds-use-varieties-developed-by-pau-farmers-told/story-6Nu4XxZxwmRyNdn8ttYqYO.html
16-05-2020||Delhi||DU might adopt open-book online exam mode from July 1||The Delhi University (DU) administration has decided to switch to the open book online examination mode from July 1 for final year students in case the Covid-19 pandemic doesn’t allow the university to hold exams via the conventional pen-and-paper mode by then. The decision has received flak from several teachers and students, who say that this cannot be an alternative to written exams in DU.In a notification issued on Thursday, Dean of Examination Vinay Gupta said that the examination for final-year students of all undergraduate and postgraduate courses, including those registered in the School of Learning (SoL) and the Non-Collegiate Women Education Board (NCWEB), will be held from July 1. “In case the situation doesn’t appear to be normal because of Covid-19 and to maintain social distancing, safety and health of the students become difficult, the University will adopt an alternative mode of examination i.e Open Book Examination (OBE) for final semester students of all undergraduate and postgraduate programmes and streams along with arrears previous semester/year. Students shall be allowed to attempt their examination from seating at home or any place as per the guidelines issued in this regard [sic],” the notification read.The exams will be conducted from July 1 in three sessions per day including Sunday, the notification added. The university will release a separate schedule for first- and second-year students of undergraduate courses and first-year students of postgraduate courses.In a detailed letter to all the principals of colleges and Deans of departments on Wednesday evening, the university’s examination branch asked them to set three question papers of each course based on the open book format and forward it to them by June 3. “Since it will be an open book examination, the question should be framed in a manner which would test the understanding and analytical skills of the students and there should be no minimum scope of verbatim copying from books and study material [sic],” the letter read.During the two-hour exam, the students will be given one extra hour to download the question paper, scan the answer sheets and upload them. The question paper will have six questions; students will be asked to attempt four in two hours.Both students and teachers are opposing the move. Rajesh Jha, a member of the DU’s executive council (EC), said that an online exam cannot be the alternative in a university like theirs. “By introducing the open-book format, things will get further complicated. Our students are already struggling to attend online classes due to logistical challenges. We can’t experiment with the future of our students. We should wait for things to get better and hold exams as usual, while taking all precautions,” he said.The Delhi University Students’ Union said it would suggest alternative measures as well after wider consultation with all stakeholders.Students said they were against online exams in any form. Unnimaya, the general secretary of the students’ union at Lady Shri Ram College for Women, said, “We at SFI-LSR surveyed 300 students of our college and 68% of them said they won’t be able to attend the exams if they were held online. Over 41% did not have access to a proper Internet connection and around 44% did not have access to laptops, computers or tablets.”The DU unit of the students’ group All India Students Association (AISA) on Tuesday issued a survey report, according to which 74% of students had responded against the online exams. A group of final-year students in the University has started an online petition on Thursday demanding the cancellation of their examination. “At a point in time when a lot of students do not have smartphones or laptops, we think that the online examination system shall be skewed in favour of those who have a room of their own, the privacy to write their examinations, and have continuous access to laptops/smartphones, electricity, and internet. We collectively believe that unprecedented times call for unprecedented measures and one such measure that we suggest vehemently is the cancellation of the exams for the final-year students,” the petition at change.org read.Sachin Maheshwari, Dean of Faculty of Technology, said, “If open books exams are being proposed, we are not prepared to conduct them. Such exams are only feasible if classroom teaching has taken place.”Teachers also raised concerns over the poor Internet connectivity in case of students living in remote areas. Pankaj Garg, an associate professor at Rajdhani College, said, “A number of our students come from interior villages. They do not have proper access to the Internet. The university should promote students based on their internal marks and last semester exams.”A member of the university’s task force constituted to combat Covid-19 said, “The administration will have to take some extraordinary measures in this extraordinary situation. We cannot wait for a long time because we will have to start the admission process in August. Also, the number of students in DU is higher than any other university in Delhi. We can’t let them come to the campus and risk their safety.” Calls and texts sent to Gupta and DU vice-chancellor Yogesh Tyagi went unanswered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/du-might-adopt-open-book-online-exam-mode-from-july-1/story-H6OXTk4ndGYkTOiqfAQcMJ.html
16-05-2020||World||Donald Trump could partially restore WHO funding; US toll could hit 100,000 in two weeks||President Donald Trump is reportedly reconsidering the suspension of US funding of the World Health Organisation and could restore its annual contribution partially, but only to match China’s $40 million, a tenth of its share of $400 million.Fox News reported Friday the president has either already signed off on the decision or is about to. “Despite (its) shortcomings, I believe that the WHO still has tremendous potential, and want to see the WHO live up to this potential, particularly now during this global crisis,” he is expected to say, according to a Fox anchor, who said he was quoting from a five-page draft the president is expected to sign.The president suspended funding for the global health agency last month as the United States investigated its response to the coronavirus outbreak. The US has accused the world body of botching the initial response and, then, of siding with China to help it conceal the exact extent of the virus outbreak. Subsequently, WHO officials had denied the claims by President and China has insisted it was transparent and open. At home in the US, the president has continued to encourage the reopening of the country, at odds with his own public health officials. He has publicly dismissed, for instance, calls for caution by Anthony Fauci, the top epidemiologist and member of the White House task force.On Friday, the chief government body for disease control and prevention has projected the death toll of Americans succumbing to Covid-19 could climb to 100,000 in two weeks, up by 13,000 from the toll on Friday.The projection of fatalities by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is based on 12 models, its director Robert Redfield, who is also member of the task force, wrote on twitter Friday. And it came as grim reminder of the need for continued surveillance and mitigation as that public health officials are urging as at least 48 states of the US are set to reopen to varying extent by early next week.“CDC tracks 12 different forecasting models of possible #COVID19 deaths in the US. As of May 11, all forecast an increase in deaths in the coming weeks and a cumulative total exceeding 100,000 by June 1,” he wrote.Covid-19 fatalities rose by 1,632 over the past 24 hours to 87,568 and the number of infections increased by 25,050 to 1.44 million. With nearly 13,000 more fatalities projected by the CDC the situation will get grimmer, specially with the removal of restrictions that it is feared to could take the toll to 147,000 by August.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-could-partially-restore-who-funding-us-toll-could-hit-100-000-in-two-weeks/story-95IKIXjkhqLqSYuhXh5JmO.html
16-05-2020||World||No special favours: New Zealand leader turned away from cafe||New Zealand’s leader found out there are no exceptions when it comes to social distancing after she was initially turned away from a cafe because it was too full under coronavirus guidelines.Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and her fiance, Clarke Gayford, decided to get brunch Saturday at Olive, a restaurant in the capital, Wellington. That was two days after the country relaxed many of its lockdown rules, including reopening restaurants.But social distancing rules still apply, requiring groups to remain at least 1 meter (3 feet) apart from each other. Many restaurants have limited their seating to comply with the rules.What happened next played out on Twitter: “Omg Jacinda Ardern just tried to come into Olive and was rejected cause it’s full,” wrote one Twitter user, Joey.Gayford took the time to respond: “I have to take responsibility for this, I didn’t get organized and book anywhere. Was very nice of them to chase us down st (street) when a spot freed up. A+ service.” Another Twitter user, Joanne, chimed in: “This has to be the most Kiwi tweet I’ve ever read ... love it, love NZ.” Asked for comment, a spokesperson from Ardern’s office said in an email that waiting at a cafe is something that anyone can experience during New Zealand’s virus restrictions: “The PM says she just waits like everyone else.” Ardern has been widely praised for her swift and decisive response to the pandemic. New Zealand closed its borders and instituted a strict lockdown in March, and has been largely successful in its goal of eliminating the virus. Health authorities have reported just a single new case over the past five days. The country has confirmed a total of 1,498 cases, including 21 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-special-favours-new-zealand-leader-turned-away-from-cafe/story-YajrzhtNotof2J4jyntwPK.html
16-05-2020||World||Donald Trump says he is considering restoring some funding to WHO, no decision made||U.S. President Donald Trump said on Saturday his administration was considering numerous proposals about the World Health Organization, including one in which Washington would pay about 10% of its former level.In a posting on Twitter, Trump underscored that no final decision had been made and that U.S. funding for the global health agency remained frozen. Trump suspended U.S. contributions to the WHO on April 14, accusing it of promoting China’s “disinformation” about the coronavirus outbreak and saying his administration would launch a review of the organization. WHO officials denied the claims and China has insisted it was transparent and open. Fox News, citing a draft letter, reported late on Friday that Trump was poised to restore partial funding to the WHO, matching China’s assessed contribution.The United States was the WHO’s biggest donor. If the United States matches China’s contribution, as the Fox report indicated, its new funding level will be about one-tenth its previous funding amount of about $400 million per year. Responding to criticism about resuming payments, Trump said, “This is just one of numerous concepts being considered under which we would pay 10% of what we have been paying over many years, matching much lower China payments. Have not made final decision.

The outlet cited analysts and executives as saying that many car owners who previously had left them home in favour of shared or public transportation are now taking their own vehicles out of safety concerns.“We have seen interest from a new kind of customer, those keen to own a personal vehicle to escape the risks of infection on public transport,” Stephan Wollenstein, chief executive of Volkswagen Group China, was quoted as saying, last week.The WSJ citing Ford Motor Co. executives reported that they have started to re-evaluate business plans for autonomous vehicles, concerned the pandemic could lower demand for shared services for a longer term.This sudden interest in use of private transportation is already having an impact on Uber and its ride-hailing rival, Lyft Inc, reported The WSJ. “Rider demand on our platform will be down for the foreseeable future,” Lyft CEO Logan Green had said last week.Mike Jackson, chief executive for AutoNation Inc., the US’s largest dealership chain, while speaking of customers who are heading to showroom said they want personal space in mobility.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-pushes-people-to-shun-means-of-mass-transportation-revives-consumers-interest-in-cars/story-FJ8qpNyV8L3op1Pi7HCh8J.html

But just as many did not. In some cases, volunteer workers were not insisting that they comply.“At another open-air testing kiosk, where throat swabs were taken, yellow and black stickers on the ground kept people from converging. But at the back of the long queue, about 40 people gathered with no guidance from officials or volunteers”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/8k-quarantined-in-ne-chinese-city-as-wary-wuhan-continues-to-test-amid-infection-fear-report/story-uXEHrHcGbvpNa0KXx3uEAO.html

There were 9,200 new confirmed coronavirus cases, the lowest increase since May 1, bringing overall infections to 272,043.The rate of increase total cases has gradually slowed, easing to 3.5 per cent from 5.8 per cent a week earlier. Some 44.8 per cent of new cases are asymptomatic, while the number of recoveries increased by 4,940 in the past day to 63,166, according to the center.Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the end of a six-week national stay-at-home order on Monday, while making regional governors responsible for relaxing lockdowns in their areas. Russia passed Spain on Tuesday to become the country with the second-most coronavirus cases in the world after the US, while also reporting the lowest fatalities among states with the highest numbers of infections.In Moscow, construction and industrial sectors have resumed work, though Mayor Sergei Sobyanin has said other restrictions must stay in place until at least May 31. He also ordered people to wear masks and gloves in public.The decline in new cases occurred mainly due to the Russian capital, where the infections rose by 3,505, down 26 per cent on the previous day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-reports-rise-in-coronavirus-deaths-amid-decline-in-new-cases/story-T4wWpEEwuUBNlsoNJqZ3RL.html

The resumption of the domestic flight services from five major airports on Saturday came as the Pakistan government last week said that it would begin a phased lifting of the lockdown due to its effect on the economy and the workforce, the Geo News reported.“The first Pakistan International Airline (PIA) flight carrying 84 passengers departed from Karachi for Lahore at 1pm along with flights for Lahore and Islamabad via private airlines,” the report said.The five major airports allowed to restart operations include Karachi’s Jinnah International Airport, Lahore’s Allama Iqbal International Airport, Islamabad International Airport (IIAP), Quetta International Airport and Peshawar’s Bacha Khan International Airport.A spokesperson for the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority (PCCA) said domestic flights will be operated by Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) and one private company for now.The ban on international flight operations, meanwhile, has been extended until May 31.However, the PCCA is keeping a close monitor of the passengers before they board the flight to ensure there is no further rise in Covid-19 cases. “Passengers will be required to fill health declaration forms before boarding the airplane and subjected to thermal scanning on entry and exit into and from a city. All luggage will be disinfected and no meet and greet will be allowed at the airports,” the report said.Aviation Minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan earlier said that social distancing will be followed based on available seats and flights will only be allowed to fill 50 per cent of their full capacity, the report said.Pakistan on Saturday said it has reported 1,581 new cases of coronavirus in the last 24 hours, taking the total infections in the country to 38,799 with 834 deaths.

16-05-2020||World||Most US states fall short of recommended Covid-19 testing levels||As businesses reopened Friday in more of the US, an overwhelming majority of states still fall short of the Covid-19 testing levels that public health experts say are necessary to safely ease lockdowns and avoid another deadly wave of outbreaks, according to an Associated Press analysis.Rapid, widespread testing is considered essential to tracking and containing the coronavirus. But 41 of the nation’s 50 states fail to test widely enough to drive their infections below a key benchmark, according to an AP analysis of metrics developed by Harvard’s Global Health Institute.Click here for Covid-19 coverageAmong the states falling short are Texas and Georgia, which recently moved aggressively to reopen stores, malls, barbershops and other businesses.Also Friday, Democrats approved a massive $3 trillion coronavirus response bill in the House over Republican opposition. It aims aims to prop up a US economy in free fall and a health care system overwhelmed by a pandemic. But the measure has no chance of passing the GOP-controlled Senate and has already drawn a White House veto threat.As health authorities expand testing to more people, the number of positive results should shrink compared with the total number of people tested. The World Health Organization and other health researchers have said a percentage above 10% indicates inadequate testing. South Korea, a country praised for its rapid response, quickly pushed its positive cases to below 3%.Most governors are moving ahead with unlocking their states, even in cases where they are not meeting broad guidelines recommended by the White House.Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has set a goal of 30,000 tests per day as his state launched one of the nation’s most aggressive reopenings on May 1. He never set a firm date on when the state would hit the 30,000 mark, but for most of May, the daily testing numbers fell short of that.Local leaders say tests are still in short supply. El Paso officials have pleaded with the governor to postpone easing up any more business restrictions in light of the Covid-19 cases there surging 60% over the past two weeks.The first stage of Maryland’s reopening began Friday evening, when some retail stores were allowed to reopen and a stay-at-home order was lifted. Some of the hardest-hit parts of the state, including the suburbs of Washington, D.C., extended restrictions for residents and businesses.Maryland averaged 4,265 tests per day this week, compared with about 4,900 the previous week. Nearly 22 percent of people tested positive in Maryland on average over the last seven days.Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan made headlines last month when the state acquired 500,000 test kits from a South Korean company in a confidential deal, but Maryland has not had all the components needed for testing — like swabs — to meet demand. Hogan said Maryland just received swabs this week from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.“We requested 350,000,” Hogan said Wednesday. “They’ve committed to 225,000, and I think we got 75,000 yesterday with another 125,000 that are supposedly days away, along with the tubes and the stuff that goes with them. So it’s not enough, but it helps us.”Harvard University researchers have calculated that the US needs to test at least 900,000 people daily to safely reopen the economy, based on the 10% positivity rate and other key metrics. That goal is nearly three times the country’s current daily testing tally of about 360,000, according to figures compiled by the Covid Tracking Project website.“The fact that testing has become the Achilles’ heel that has made it hard for us to have a great national response to this pandemic is a tragedy,” said Dr. Ashish Jha, director of Harvard’s Global Health Institute.President Donald Trump insisted again this week that his administration “met the moment” and “prevailed” on testing, even as he continued shifting responsibility for the effort to the governors. Administration officials said they will provide states with enough testing supplies to conduct about 400,000 tests per day in May and June. That’s less than half the total recommended by the Harvard team.Only nine states met the daily rate recommended by Jha and his colleagues, according to the AP analysis. Most of those states are large and rural, such as Montana, Alaska, North Dakota and Wyoming. Meanwhile, states with some of the biggest testing shortfalls, including New York and New Jersey, have signaled they will keep stay-at-home orders in place or only partially ease restrictions.“I really do feel there are dangers here to opening up without enough tests, but I don’t feel it’s a uniform danger everywhere in the country,” Jha said.In New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo will allow many smaller cities and rural regions of upstate New York to gradually reopen first, industry by industry, in areas that have been spared the brunt of the coronavirus outbreak.The first wave of businesses includes retail — though only for curbside or in-store pickup — along with construction and manufacturing. Cuomo also announced beaches would be allowed to open in time for the Memorial Day weekend.New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy will let individual shore towns decide whether to reopen beaches. His long-awaited guidance Thursday directed them to set occupancy limits, require 6 feet (2 meters) of space between beachgoers, except family members or couples, and prohibit groups of 10 or more from congregating on the beach.California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced that the state’s testing reached 35,000 daily this week and that more than 1 million tests have been administered. The state remains on lockdown, though Southern California’s beaches are open with restrictions.North Carolina also has made testing progress, reporting on an all-time high of more than 12,000 additional tests completed Friday compared to the previous day. But the state’s seven-day rolling average of just over 6,000 tests is still well below the 11,000 daily tests recommended by the Harvard team. The testing increases over the past few weeks contributed in part to Gov. Roy Cooper and state leaders feeling comfortable with easing his stay-at-home order May 8.Grand Canyon National Park reopened Friday to allow visitors in for day trips but not overnight. By 7:30 a.m., more than two dozen people were enjoying South Rim viewpoints. Signs reminded tourists to keep their distance from one another and stay in groups of less than 10.Volume of testing isn’t the only concern. The Food and Drug Administration said late Thursday that it was investigating preliminary data suggesting a rapid Covid-19 test used daily to test Trump and key members of his staff can miss infections. Trump expressed confidence in the test from Abbott Laboratories.Worldwide, there have been more than 4.4 million coronavirus infections reported and 300,000 deaths, while nearly 1.6 million people have recovered, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/most-us-states-fall-short-of-recommended-covid-19-testing-levels/story-ury13SGkqKJlWCeYDUumVM.html
16-05-2020||World||Covid-19: Italy to allow travel to and from abroad from June 3||Italy’s government on Saturday approved a decree which will allow travel to and from abroad from June 3, in a major development as it moves to unwind one of the world’s most rigid coronavirus lockdowns.The government will allow free travel across the country from that same day. Some regions had pushed for a swifter rollback, but Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has insisted on a gradual return to normal to prevent a second wave of infections.More than 31,600 Italians have died of Covid-19 since the outbreak came to light on Feb. 21, the third-highest death toll in the world after that of the United States and Britain. In a bid to contain the contagion, Italy was the first European country to impose nationwide restrictions in March, only sanctioning an initial relaxation of the rules on May 4, when it allowed factories and parks to reopen.Shops are due to open on May 18 and the government decided that all movement within individual regions should be allowed that same day, meaning people will be able to visit friends. The inter-regional and foreign travel ban will remain in place until after Italy’s June 2 Republic Day holiday, preventing any mass travel over that long-holiday weekend.But all travel curb will be lifted from June 3 -- a major milestone on Italy’s road to recovery, with the government hoping to salvage the forthcoming vacation season, when Italians traditionally escape the cities for their annual summer breaks.The regions can reactivate all sectors of the economy that might still be shuttered, so long as safety protocols are followed. National health authorities will monitor the situation to make sure infections are kept in check, the decree said.Shops and restaurants across the country are preparing to reopen under strict social distancing and hygiene rules, as recommended by health authorities.“The challenge is huge, so big it is hard to quantify, and most of all there is uncertainty. The sense of uncertainty is dominating everything,” said Alberto Volpe, manager of a clothing shop in central Rome.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-italy-to-allow-travel-to-and-from-abroad-from-june-3/story-G1Jpr440oSWR1dTHIF3RBJ.html
16-05-2020||World||Trump fires State Department watchdog critical of admin moves||President Donald Trump has fired the State Department’s inspector general, an Obama administration appointee whose office was critical of alleged political bias in the agency’s management. The ouster is the latest in a series of moves against independent executive branch watchdogs who have found fault with the Trump administration.A senior department official said Trump removed Steve Linick from his job on Friday but gave no reason for his ouster. In a letter to Congress, Trump said Linick, who had held the job since 2013, no longer had his full confidence and that his removal would take effect in 30 days. Trump did not mention Linick by name in his letter.Democrats in Congress immediately cried foul, with the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee suggesting that Linick was fired in part in retaliation for opening an unspecified investigation into Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.“This firing is the outrageous act of a president trying to protect one of his most loyal supporters, the secretary of state, from accountability,” Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., said in a statement. “I have learned that the Office of the Inspector General had opened an investigation into Secretary Pompeo. Mr. Linick’s firing amid such a probe strongly suggests that this is an unlawful act of retaliation.”Engel offered no details of the alleged investigation into Pompeo, but Linick’s office had issued several reports critical of the department’s handling of personnel matters, including accusing some of Trump’s appointees of retaliating against career officials.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi also condemned Linick’s ouster, saying he had been “punished for honorably performing his duty to protect the Constitution and our national security.”“The president must cease his pattern of reprisal and retaliation against the public servants who are working to keep Americans safe, particularly during this time of global emergency.”Linick will replaced by Stephen Akard, a former career foreign service officer who has close ties to Vice President Mike Pence, said the official, who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. Akard currently runs the department’s Office of Foreign Missions. He had been nominated to be the director general of the foreign service but withdrew after objections he wasn’t experienced enough.Linick, a former assistant U.S. attorney in California and Virginia, had overseen inspector general reports that were highly critical of the department’s management policies during the Trump administration. His office had criticized several Trump appointees for their treatment of career staff for apparently being insufficiently supportive of Trump and his policies.Under Linick, the State Department’s inspector general office was also critical of former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s hiring freeze and attempts to streamline the agency by slashing its funding and personnel.Trump has been taking aim lately at inspectors general.In April, he fired Michael Atkinson, the inspector general for the intelligence community, for his role in the whistleblower complaint that led to Trump’s impeachment.Then Trump removed Glenn Fine as acting inspector general at the Defense Department, a move that stripped him of his post as chairman of the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee.During a White House briefing on COVID-19, Trump questioned the independence of an inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services over a report that said there was a shortage of supplies and testing at hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/secretary-of-state-mike-pompeo-fires-state-dept-watchdog-critical-of-trump-moves/story-AGHBeOHWlsSZczewMmRvNN.html

We will see what happens over the next little while,” Trump told reporters at the White House, when asked why he did not want to not speak to Xi.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here  China, as per the trade deal inked earlier this year, is buying a lot more of American goods than last year. “They are spending a lot on the trade deal, but the trade deal I don’t know somehow I lost a little flavour for it, you can understand,” Trump said. Earlier in the day, Trump said he did not want to talk about the trade deal. “I don’t want to talk about it. I can say China is buying a lot of our products. But the trade deal -- the ink was barely dry -- when this (coronavirus) came in from China. So, it’s not like we’re thrilled,” he said. “This should have never happened. This came from China. It should have been stopped in China before it got out to the world. One-eighty-six countries are affected. Each country that’s affected is the same thing. Russia now is badly affected. France is badly affected. You look at each country and you can say “affected” or you can say “infected,” either way you want to put it,” he said. White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters that President Trump is frustrated with China. “I will leave it to the president as to when he resumes speaking with the Chinese leader. But look, China slow walked this. I’ve shared with you guys before on human-to-human transmission. It was really important that the world knew of that aspect of the disease, but that information was slow walked through to the WHO,” she said. “The genetic sequencing, likewise, was not given until a professor in Shanghai did so on his own. The president has repeatedly noted that why are they letting flights out of China but not into China? These decisions put American lives at risk. Not just American lives, the lives around the globe,” she said. “We know that this disease came from China, and why that information was not shared, some of the information I just suggested is really unacceptable. So he’s frustrated at this point, and I’ll leave it to him,” McEnany said. Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the Trump administration will not tolerate efforts by the Chinese Communist Party to undermine the privacy of US citizens or the integrity of next-generation networks worldwide.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage  “(Chinese technology company) Huawei is an untrustworthy vendor and a tool of the Chinese Communist Party, beholden to its orders. The Department of Justice has indicted Huawei for stealing US technology and helping Iran evade sanctions, and the Department of Commerce has placed Huawei on the Entity List in 2019. The Department of State has engaged for more than a year to share what we know about Huawei and other untrustworthy vendors with allies and partners around the world,” he said. On Friday, the Department of Justice expanded rules to prevent Huawei from undermining US export controls, closing a loophole that has allowed the company to exploit US technology and threaten national security. “It also imposes US export control restrictions on countries that use US technology or software to design and produce semiconductors for Huawei. Companies wishing to sell certain items to Huawei produced with US technology must now obtain a license from the United States,” he said. The US will continue to restrict most American exports to Huawei and its affiliates on the Entity List for activities that threaten US national security and international stability, Pompeo said.

16-05-2020||World||Slovenia first European country to declare an end to coronavirus epidemic, relaxes some border control||The Slovenian government late on Thursday called an official end to its coronavirus epidemic, becoming the first European country to do so, after authorities confirmed less than seven new coronavirus cases each day for the past two weeks.People now arriving in Slovenia from other European Union states will no longer be obliged to go into a quarantine for at least seven days as was the case from early April, the government said in a statement.The country of 2 million people, which borders Italy, Austria, Hungary and Croatia, has so far reported 1,464 coronavirus cases and 103 deaths. It declared an epidemic on March 12.“Slovenia has tamed the epidemic over the past two months... Today Slovenia has the best epidemiologic picture in Europe,” Prime Minister Janez Jansa told parliament earlier on Thursday.The end of epidemic means some measures, including financial aid to citizens and firms hit by the coronavirus, will expire at the end of May.The government said foreign citizens who show signs of coronavirus infection will still not be allowed to enter the country.A quarantine of at least 14 days will remain in place for people from non-EU states, except for some exemptions including diplomats and people transporting cargo.Citizens will still have to follow basic rules to prevent a possible spread of infection, the government said without elaborating.People have been required to wear masks in indoor public spaces, stand at least 1.5 metres (5 feet) apart and disinfect hands upon entering public spaces.Since the middle of March, Slovenia has closed all schools, sports and cultural institutions, bars, restaurants, hotels and shops apart from food and drug stores, while cancelling public transport.The government has started easing the lockdown from April 20. Public transport resumed earlier this week while next week some pupils will return to schools. All bars and restaurants as well as small hotels with up to 30 rooms will be allowed to open next week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/slovenia-first-european-country-to-declare-an-end-to-coronavirus-epidemic-relaxes-some-border-controls/story-ZRpWR6Fo9UVmcyTKW2phlK.html
16-05-2020||World||Worrying surge in childhood disease may be linked to Covid-19: WHO||Europe and the United States have seen sharp surges in recent weeks of a severe immune disorder in children linked to Covid-19, health authorities reported Friday, sounding an alarm.At least five children -- three in New York, and one each in France and Britain -- have died from the syndrome, and at least two other deaths are suspect.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageUp to now, Covid-19 -- with 4.5 million confirmed cases worldwide, and more than 300,000 deaths -- has largely spared small children and teens, though many are thought to have been infected without showing symptoms.But the new illness, while still very rare by comparison, suggests that no age bracket is safe.Europe has seen some 230 suspected cases of so-called paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome (PIMS) in children up to 14 years old, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) said Friday.Doctors in Bergamo, northern Italy reported a 30-fold increase in the incidence of severe inflammatory disorders among young children, with ten cases from mid-February to mid-April as compared to 19 during the previous five years, according to a study this week in The Lancet. In the US, where well over 100 cases have been identified in the New York area, health authorities have issued an alert for the mysterious illness. “Initial reports hypothesise that this syndrome may be related to Covid-19,” World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a virtual briefing Friday, calling on clinicians worldwide to help “better understand this syndrome in children.”France’s state-run health watchdog described the likelihood of such a link as “very probable.”Like Kawasaki disease, a rare condition that occurs in very young children, the new disorder can cause persistent fever, searing abdominal pain, rashes and a swollen tongue.Also compared to toxic shock syndrome, PIMS leads to inflamed blood vessels and, in some cases, damage to the heart.A nine-year-old boy who died in the southern French city of Marseille was said to have suffered “a neurological injury related to cardiac arrest” -- in other words, a heart attack.A delayed impact Experts speculate that the virus triggers a violent response in the immune system, causing it to turn against, rather than protect, the tissue and organs of affected children.“They had the virus, the body fought it off earlier,” Sunil Sood, a paediatrician at Cohen Children’s Medical Center in New York, told AFP. “But now there’s this delayed, exaggerated immune response.”PIMS is different, however, from the Kawasaki syndrome in that it seems mainly to affect older children.“The population we are seeing are seven or eight through to 17,” Karyn Moshal, a paediatric infectious disease consultant at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London told BMJ, a medical journal.Only a minority of children affected by the inflammatory syndrome have tested positive for the new coronavirus, but that doesn’t mean they didn’t have it, experts say.Evelina London Children’s Hospital has seen more than 50 children with signs of the syndrome, said Julia Kenny, a consultant in immunology at the hospital.“While very few tested positive for the virus on swabs, the majority tested positive for Covid-19 antibodies,” which means they caught the virus without knowing it, she told BMJ.Indeed, the surge in PIMS cases appears to lag several weeks behind the peak in Covid-19 infections across the general population, suggesting that antibodies may play a role in triggering the symptoms.“In London, the peak (across the whole population) was estimated around the first or second week of April, and we think we saw the peak of these children this or last week,” Liz Whittaker, a lecturer in children’s infectious disease and immunology at Imperial College London, said at a press briefing on Wednesday. “What we wonder is whether this is an antibody mediated or delayed response to the virus that is happening several weeks after the infection,” she said. “That would explain why these children don’t test positive for the virus.”Researchers are groping for answers as to why some kids and not others get hit with the syndrome.In adults, the strongest predictors have been pre-existing health problems, especially high blood pressure, but none of these applies to young children.One theory emerging from the recent cases points to a genetic link.In England, six of the eight first cases observed were in children of Afro-Caribbean origin, according to a study last week in The Lancet.The boy who died in France was also of African origin, his doctor reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/worrying-surge-in-childhood-disease-may-be-linked-to-covid-19-who/story-wYIfEki4pRyf8ndrvG3QWN.html
16-05-2020||World||Fearing Covid-19, biggest US university system makes fall term virtual||As uncertainty about the spread of Covid-19 continues, the biggest university system in the United States decided this week to make fall term classes virtual, one of the first to do so, amid fears of a second wave of infections in the month ahead.California State University said almost all classes across its 23 university campuses would be online at least until the end of the fall term. Programs such as the maritime academy, which holds classes aboard a training ship, may be among a handful of exceptions. The Cal State university system serves 482,000 students.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“As the largest four-year system of higher education in the country, while the spotlight is on us in terms of the decision, we weren’t hoping to influence anyone,” said Cal State spokesperson Mike Uhlenkamp.“This is a decision that the chancellor and the campus presidents arrived at that we feel is in the best interests of our students and our employees.”Colleges and universities across the United States are grappling with similar decisions. But it was the timing of Cal State’s announcement that came to some as a surprise. Other colleges and universities have said their decisions would come later in the summer.As of Friday, the Covid-19 respiratory disease has infected more than 1.4 million Americans and killed at least 85,816, according to a Reuters tally. Efforts to stem the spread of the disease have shut schools and businesses nationwide, severely disrupted travel and devastated the economy. Top US infectious diseases expert Dr. Anthony Fauci has warned that a second wave of infections is a near certainty in the fall, which helped influence Cal State’s decision, according to the chancellor’s statement earlier this week.“Obviously, this isn’t what anyone had planned for,” said Cal State’s Uhlenkamp. “I want to make sure that people understand that we’re not closed. The campuses are not closed.”’Social aspect’Cal State universities moved to online classes on March 17. Students who could go home were asked to do so; those who couldn’t were permitted to remain on campus.“The social aspect is just completely gone, and I do very much miss it,” said Ofer Barr, a 19-year-old mechanical engineering student at California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo, who has moved back in with his parents in Los Angeles.“Here at home, the only thing I’ve really found that lets me have any kind of social interaction is video games,” Barr said.Some students are now living with their families in different time zones, which can be a problem for classes with fixed times. Some classes are hard to make virtual.“A lot of the art classes that I take are lab classes, they’re studio classes,” said William Hunter, a 21-year-old studio arts major at San Francisco State University.Moving online has been costly for the universities. Earlier this week Cal State’s board of trustees discussed an estimated $337 million in new costs and revenue losses for the spring term due to Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fearing-covid-19-biggest-us-university-system-makes-fall-term-virtual/story-yvZqGRmeVAK2StDfouatWI.html

16-05-2020||World||Coronavirus pandemic planning becomes political weapon as deaths mount in US||For the first three years of his presidency, Donald Trump did not publicly utter the words “pandemic” or “preparedness.” Not in speeches, rallies or his many news conferences, planned and impromptu.But on Friday, the White House pointed to extensive planning exercises the administration conducted and reports it wrote warning of the threat in 2018.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageStill, Trump has repeatedly said that the blame for the federal government having inadequate stockpiles of crucial supplies and machines needed to cope with an outbreak lay with his predecessor, Barack Obama.Obama has been a persistent foil for Trump on a number of issues, but in the case of planning for the pandemic he has devoted little attention to the 69-page “playbook” from the Obama administration about the threat of a viral outbreak that might include Ebola or an airborne respiratory illness like coronavirus. And the Obama administration could draw from a similar document written during the administration of George W. Bush in 2006.The politics of pandemic planning have gotten increasingly pitched as the Covid-19 death toll continues to mount in the United States.Trump claims he inherited a “broken, terrible” system from Obama. Critics counter that Trump had three years in office to prepare — more than enough time to build on the pandemic strategies he inherited.The friction was laid bare in the Rose Garden and the White House briefing room on Friday.Trump, at a midday event outside the Oval Office, declared: “I inherited nothing. I inherited practically nothing from the previous administration, unfortunately.”His spokeswoman, Kayleigh McEnany, later displayed a copy of the Obama plan dismissively during a briefing in the White House press room before hoisting two binders of what she called the superior Trump plans.Beth Cameron, who worked on pandemic planning in the Obama administration, said the playbook that the Obama administration presented to the Trump administration “was given, briefed and discussed with the incoming administration, explicitly.” She said it was intended to provide the White House with a set of questions it should ask early on in an emerging epidemic or pandemic threat.“It outlined who should come together to answer those questions and to be prepared to anticipate what was coming next ... to get moving,” Cameron said. She said the Trump administration was slow to respond to Covid-19 and that Obama’s playbook could have helped the administration get ahead of an emerging threat like the coronavirus.Cameron said the Bush and Obama administrations both did extensive planning for pandemics and many of those plans were passed to the Trump White House. “They were not political. They were non-partisan,” she added.McEnany styled the Trump administration’s response to Covid-19 as “unprecedented.” She referred to Obama’s plan as a “thin packet of paper” that was replaced by “two detailed, robust pandemic response reports commissioned by the Trump administration.”She said that in 2018 the Trump administration issued its own pandemic crisis action plan and last summer conducted Crimson Contagion 2019, a simulation to test the nation’s ability to respond to a large-scale outbreak. In January, the Department of Health and Human Services issued an after-action report.“This exercise expounded upon — exposed rather — the shortcomings in legacy planning documents, which inform President Trump’s coronavirus response beginning as early as January,” McEnany said.Her comments drew criticism from Ron Klain, who was the U.S. Ebola response coordinator during the Obama administration and now advises Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden.“Let’s get to the bottom line,” Klain tweeted after McEnany’s briefing. “If their position now is that they HAD a plan, and that THIS was their plan ... I fail to see how that is a helpful argument for them in any way.”The Trump administration’s 36-page National Biodefense Strategy, issued in September 2018, was a self-described “call to action.” Among the many goals was bolstering preparedness to save lives through “medical countermeasures,” such as vaccines, ventilators, diagnostic tests and personal protective equipment like medical gowns and masks that were in short supply in the early days of the pandemic.McEnacy said the nation’s stockpile was insufficient, but didn’t answer questions about why Trump didn’t work to restock it during his first three years in office. The White House said the stockpile had only 28% of the items needed during a pandemic and contained less than a one-month supply of key items, but the administration is updating inventories and how they are distributed.Cameron said Trump had plenty to study when he entered the Oval Office.Bush took a keen interest in preparing the nation for an influenza pandemic after reading John M. Barry’s “The Great Influenza” about the 1918 influenza that killed more than 500,000 Americans and more than 20 million people across the globe.He read the book in 2005 while at his Texas ranch. A few months later, Bush gave a speech at the National Institutes of Health rolling out the first modern-day national strategy to prepare for an influenza pandemic, detect outbreaks, expand vaccine production capacity and stockpile treatments.“Unlike storms or floods, which strike in an instant and then recede, a pandemic can continue spreading destruction in repeated waves that can last for a year or more,” Bush said in the November 2005 speech..Obama worked on the Ebola epidemic and also on H1N1 and the Zika virus. In 2014, Obama stood up the White House’s National Security Council Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense to coordinate government resources in preparation for the next disease outbreak and prevent it from becoming a pandemic.There are scores of other pandemic planning books on the shelves, including the Biological Incident Annex, which was updated by the Obama administration and re-issued in January 2017 as Trump took office. The Pandemic Crisis Action Plan from 2018 that McEnany talked about is not online, but a General Accounting Office report references it.“President Trump has been in office for well over three years now, which is more than enough to build upon the pandemic strategies he inherited,” said Lawrence Gostin, a public health expert at Georgetown University who worked with the Bush and Obama administrations on global health issues.“It’s quite evident that whatever pandemic planning had been done during the Bush or Obama administrations never made it to high levels in the Trump administration.”He thinks Trump was just focused on other issues — that pandemic planning wasn’t a top priority for the president.Gostin said he was startled when Trump first said that no one expected a pandemic like Covid-19 to happen.“Well, every global health expert expected this to happen,” Gostin said. “We couldn’t tell you when it would happen. We couldn’t tell you exactly what the pathogen would be, but we always knew that there was a big novel pandemic coming.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-pandemic-planning-becomes-political-weapon-as-deaths-mount/story-6pOBlYbmN3sACMLIe53tdP.html

The statement said there were “multiple clashes.”The military police said officers seized eight rifles, 85 grenades and some narcotics.Five people were pronounced dead at a nearby hospital, while five other bodies were later carried by local residents to the entrance of the Alemao group of slums.The bodies were laid next to one another on the street and drew a small crowd of people, some of whom were not wearing any masks despite the coronavirus pandemic. Family members at the scene cried as they covered the bodies, already wrapped in fabrics, with cardboard boxes to shelter them from the rain.From January through March, police killed 429 people during operations in Rio de Janeiro state, down 1.6% from the same period a year earlier. Homicides have also gone down, declining 0.9% this year to 1,044 victims.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/10-dead-in-gunbattles-during-police-raid-on-rio-slum-complex/story-QcwKgRXT0AIugKIje4XhML.html
16-05-2020||World||Pakistani doctor indicted in Minnesota on terrorism charge||A Pakistani doctor and former Mayo Clinic researcher has been indicted on one count of attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization after authorities say he told paid FBI informants that he pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group and wanted to carry out lone wolf attacks in the USThe indictment against Muhammad Masood, 28, was announced Friday by US Attorney Erica MacDonald. Masood was initially charged by criminal complaint and has been in custody since his March 19 arrest at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport.Prosecutors say Masood was in the US on a work visa. They allege in court documents that from January to March, Masood made several statements to paid informants — whom he believed were members of the Islamic State group — pledging his allegiance to the group and its leader. He also expressed a desire to travel to Syria to fight for IS and carry out lone wolf attacks in the US, they said.Masood messaged an informant “there is so much I wanted to do here .. .lon wulf stuff you know ... but I realized I should be on the ground helping brothers sisters kids,” according to an FBI affidavit.Prosecutors say Masood planned to leave for Amman, Jordan, and go on to Syria at the end of March, but on March 16 he had to change his travel plans because Jordan closed its borders due to the coronavirus pandemic. Masood and one of the informants then developed a plan for him to fly from Minneapolis to Los Angeles to meet with that informant, whom Masood believed would help him travel in a cargo ship into Islamic State territory.Masood’s attorney didn’t immediately return messages left Friday.Court documents do not name the clinic where Masood worked. The Mayo Clinic has confirmed that Masood formerly worked at the medical center, but said he was not employed there when he was arrested. According to an affidavit supporting the criminal complaint, Masood said in February that he was going to notify his employer that his last day of work would be March 17.The affidavit said the FBI began investigating in January, after learning that someone, later determined to be Masood, had posted messages on an encrypted social media platform indicating an intent to support IS.On Jan. 24, Masood contacted one of the informants on the encrypted platform and said he was a medical doctor with a Pakistani passport and wanted to travel to Syria, Iraq or northern Iran near Afghanistan “to fight on the front line as well as help the wounded brothers,” the affidavit said.Roughly three dozen Minnesotans — mostly men from the state’s large Somali community — have left since 2007 to join al-Shabab in Somalia or militant groups in Syria, including the Islamic State group. Several others have been convicted on terrorism-related charges for plotting to join or provide support to those groups.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistani-doctor-indicted-in-minnesota-on-terrorism-charge/story-sgHU08FcsraAdDNDDEcPLN.html

The Air Force previously oversaw offensive and defensive operations in space.Trump’s enthusiasm for Space Force has drawn sporadic criticism and provided fodder for comedians. A satirical Netflix series, “Space Force,” debuts later this month, starring Steve Carell and John Malkovich.The Pentagon’s budget allocated funding for the force, including “space-related weapons systems and operations.” The Space Force’s procurement budget is projected to reach $4.7 billion by fiscal year 2025.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-unveils-space-force-flag-says-us-building-super-duper-missile/story-PKUYfq8rp8eHS29TPpb8SL.html
16-05-2020||World||US adds new sanction to cut off chip supplies to Chinese tech giant Huawei||The U.S. government imposed new restrictions on Chinese tech giant Huawei on Friday, severely limiting its ability to use American technology to design and manufacture semiconductors produced for it abroad.Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said Friday that the move aims to prevent Huawei from making a run around existing U.S. sanctions.“There has been a very highly technical loophole through which Huawei has been able to in effect use U.S. technology,” Ross told Fox Business. “We never intended that loophole to be there.”Adam Segal, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said the move “looks like a victory for the people who really want to drive the nail, or what they think will be the nail, in Huawei’s coffin,” saidThe new restrictions elicited an angry response from China, which threatened retaliation against U.S. companies.Chip design and manufacturing equipment used in the world’s semiconductor plants is mostly U.S. made, so the new rule aims to impact multiple foreign producers that sell to Huawei and affiliates including HiSilicon, which makes chips used in supercomputers with scientific and military uses. The Commerce Department said foreign foundries would be granted a 120-day grace period.Under the new rules, foreign semiconductor makers must obtain a license from U.S. officials in order to ship to Huawei-designed semiconductors to the Chinese company that were produced using U.S. technology.Last year, the Trump administration barred U.S. firms from using Huawei technology or providing technology to the Chinese firm without government approval, deeming it a national security risk. The Commerce Department exempted a narrow list of products and services and has continuously extended that limited waiver, largely to lessen the impact on U.S. wireless carriers that use Huawei technology in their networks. This week, it added another 90 days.The new restrictions are separate from those exemptions, but loopholes have allowed U.S. companies to continue to supply Huawei with chips made outside the U.S.The Commerce Department said in a statement Friday that the new restrictions would “narrowly and strategically” target Huawei’s acquisition of semiconductors that it designs built in overseas foundries that use U.S. software and technology. Kevin Wolf, an attorney at Akin Gump who oversaw export administration at the Commerce Department during the Obama administration, noted the narrow scope of the rules.“If a foreign foundry makes a chip based on a Huawei design and U.S. equipment is used to make a chip then it’s controlled, but if a chip is not made from a Huawei design then it is not controlled,” he said.Huawei did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But China’s official Global Times newspaper threatened countermeasures on Friday. It said Beijing that could include restrictions on U.S. companies including Qualcomm, Cisco and Apple. It also threatened to suspend purchases of Boeing aircraft.Global Times noted that the new Commerce rules would block companies such as TSMC, a Taiwainese chip maker, from providing semiconductors to Huawei. TSMC announced plans this week to build a chip plant in Arizona. It did not immediately respond to an Associated Press query on whether the new rules might alter those plans.“It seems the U.S. is ratcheting up efforts to pinch China’s high-tech companies,” the editorial read, calling it more than just an element of President Donald Trump’s re-election strategy. “U.S. suppression has become the No. 1 challenge to China’s development.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-adds-new-sanction-to-cut-off-chip-supplies-to-chinese-tech-giant-huawei/story-BbUStRf157SeySldFD1FMN.html
16-05-2020||World||China firmly denies covering up outbreak, delaying action||China said it did not know until Jan. 19 how infectious the new coronavirus is, pushing back against accusations that it intentionally withheld information about the severity of the outbreak in Wuhan from the world.While Chinese officials knew that there were signs of human-to-human transmission earlier, it was hard to ascertain the new virus’s level of contagiousness, said Zeng Yixin, vice minister of the National Health Commission, at a press briefing in Beijing on Friday. There are diseases like HIV that while infectious, are not easily transmitted from person to person, he said.It was only on Jan. 19 that Chinese scientists concluded that the virus spreads easily among people and China released that information to the world the next day, said Zeng.The accounting of events from top officials came as China faces growing blame for a delay in sounding the alarm about the coronavirus, which allowed people to spread it unwittingly for some time. Zeng was responding to an Associated Press report in April that cited confidential documents showing Chinese officials were internally discussing the possibility of widespread infections six days before President Xi Jinping warned the public of the dangers of the virus.The alleged delay resulted in millions of people traveling from Wuhan to elsewhere in the country and the world, seeding a pandemic that has now sickened over 4.4 million people and killed over 300,000.Giving a rundown of events since the crisis began, Zeng said that China concluded on Jan. 9 that it was dealing with a novel coronavirus and began developing test kits the next day. On Jan. 12, it informed the World Health Organization about the outbreak.On Jan. 14, a national meeting of provincial health officials was held. “Many uncertainties remained. We understood there’s more research needed on human-to-human transmission and we couldn’t rule out the chance of a further spread of the virus,” said Zeng. “But we couldn’t reach conclusions to many questions.”Trump’s WHO Attack Accelerates Breakdown in Global CooperationBesides its alleged delay in disclosing information on the virus outbreak at an earlier stage, China has also faced skepticism about its official tallies of deaths and infections.The pandemic has revived tensions between the world’s two largest economies. China and the US are escalating disputes from visas to supply chains as the two countries continue blaming each other regarding the origins of the virus, a mystery that global experts are trying to unravel.Earlier this month, US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo accused China of covering up the virus by silencing doctors who tried to warn about the disease and ordering that samples be destroyed on Jan. 3. Liu Dengfeng, another NHC official, said that China did issue a document on Jan. 3 about lab safety and that the country’s regulations have clear requirements for how to handle samples, including their destruction.“The comments made by these US officials are taken out of context and intended to confuse the public,” Liu said, adding that China has shared samples with countries including the US, UK and Australia in recent years.Along with the US, countries including Australia and Germany have sought an investigation into how the previously unknown virus made the jump from animals to humans before being discovered in Wuhan last year.What We Don’t Know About Coronavirus Origins Might Kill UsAsked if China rejected a request from the WHO to visit the P4 lab in Wuhan that some have speculated is linked to the virus, NHC official Li Mingzhu said the agency has never asked to visit a particular lab in China and it’s thus “not true” that such a request was turned down.Li wasn’t asked if China would allow access to the lab if a request was made.While the number of infections has dropped dramatically in China, the nation still faces the threat of a second wave after a new cluster emerged in its northeastern region ahead of high-profile political meetings scheduled to convene next week in Beijing.Xi on Thursday called for stronger measures to contain any risk that could undermine the country’s success so far. In Wuhan, officials have been directed to prepare for mass testing the entire population of 11 million after new cases were reported for the first time since the city’s lockdown lifted in April.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-firmly-denies-covering-up-outbreak-delaying-action/story-fiOeiG7IXLxFn73xxSSeJI.html

Including arrears that stretch back several years, “the United States is the largest debtor, owing 1.165 billion and 1.332 billion US dollars respectively,” China added.ALSO WATCH | Covid: Chinese hackers targeting US vaccine research? Donald Trump respondsThe US is the biggest contributor to the UN budget, paying 22 percent of its annual running costs, a bill which adds up to around $3 billion; and 25 percent of its peacekeeping operations, which amount to some $6 billion a year.Officially, Washington is meant to pay 27.89 percent of the peacekeeping budget, but a decision made by Congress and implemented by President Donald Trump in 2017 cut that payment to 25 percent, meaning Washington runs up an annual shortfall of $200 million.The United States also has a fiscal year that runs from October to October, which can make it look like an even bigger debtor at certain times of the year. The US mission to the UN dismissed the call, saying China is “eager to distract attention from its cover-up and mismanagement of the COVID-19 crisis, and this is yet another example.”It continued: “The United States recently made a payment of $726 million toward its peacekeeping assessment, and per practice will pay the bulk of its assessment at the end of the calendar year.”It said the total peacekeeping arrears was $888 million, adding: “Roughly two-thirds of this amount is the result of payment at the rate of 25 percent from 2017 through the present.”The payment of contributions by member countries for peacekeeping operations has a direct impact on the reimbursements the UN pays to countries that contribute troops to the 15 or so missions around the world.In a report on May 11, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned that “there may be significant delays towards the middle of the year, unless the cash position across missions improves significantly.”On Thursday, around 50 of the 193 member states, including China, paid their contributions in full, which Beijing -- the second largest contributor, far behind the United States -- noted in its statement.China pays around 12 percent of the UN’s running costs and around 15 percent of the peacekeeping budget.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/largest-debtor-china-calls-on-us-to-pay-its-debts-to-the-united-nations/story-3GYuSQ0JvK604jd4lJwk1I.html

The peak of the crisis has yet to hit Latin America’s largest nation, experts say.Gen. Eduardo Pazuello, who had no health experience until he became the Health Ministry’s No. 2 official in April, will be the interim minister until Bolsonaro chooses a replacement. Brazilian media have said that Teich’s ability to do his job had been weakened by the appointment of dozens of military personnel to jobs in the ministry.Also Read: ‘No benefit’ in hydroxychloroquine virus treatment: Studies“Life is made up of choices and today I decided to leave,” Teich told journalists in capital Brasilia. He did not explain why he left the job and refused to answer questions.Teich’s resignation came one day after Bolsonaro told business leaders in a video conference he would ease rules for use of chloroquine to treat people infected with the coronavirus. Teich has frequently called use of the drug “an uncertainty,” and this week warned of its side effects.The Health Ministry previously allowed chloroquine to be used in coronavirus cases only for patients hospitalized in serious condition.Also Read: 881 single-day deaths, over 1.7 lakh cases: Brazil becoming new Covid-19 hotspotAt Bolsonaro’s urging, the country’s Army Chemical and Pharmaceutical Laboratory boosted chloroquine production in late March.Researchers last month reported no benefit in a large analysis of the drug or a related substance, hydroxychloroquine, in U.S. hospitals for veterans. Last month, scientists in Brazil stopped part of a study of chloroquine after heart rhythm problems developed in one quarter of people given the higher of two doses being tested.Governors who have recommended quarantine measures and refrained from touting the drug’s unproven potential said Teich’s resignation reflects Bolsonaro’s failure to manage the pandemic.Rio de Janeiro Gov. Wilson Witzel, a former ally of Bolsonaro, said “no one can do serious work with interference in ministries.” “That is why governors and mayors need to lead the pandemic crisis, and not you, Mr. President,” Witzel said on Twitter.The governor of Ceara, one of Brazil’s most hard-hit states, said Teich’s exit “brings enormous insecurity and concern.”“It is unacceptable that in the face of this serious health crisis, the focus of the government is still on political and ideological discussions. That is an affront to the nation,” Camilo Santana said.Bolsonaro fired Teich’s predecessor, Mandetta, on April 16 after disagreements over efforts to contain the new coronavirus. The president opposed governors’ quarantine recommendations and restrictions on businesses, was eager to resume economic activity and warned failure to do so would cause Brazil to descend into “chaos”.Mandetta had sided with the governors and became the embodiment of challenges to Bolsonaro’s position. Teich took office pledging to balance health care concerns and the president’s economic worries. He did not openly challenge the president’s views, but did defend stay-at-home measures.Also Read: Bolsonaro fires Brazil’s health minister, calls to reopen economyMiguel Lago, executive director of Brazil’s non-profit Institute for Health Policy Studies, which advises public health officials, said Teich wasn’t able to build his own team, didn’t have Mandetta’s political strength and wasn’t willing to violate the scientific recommendations.“He clearly had limitations,” Lago said. “He would not challenge what has been consensus among the scientific community. He would never accept the chloroquine thing that Bolsonaro wanted him to do, to recommend publicly that chloroquine was a remedy to be used in the public health system.”Risk consultancy Eurasia Group noted that while governors play a key role in responding to the virus, the Ministry of Health coordinates between states and ensures that “medical equipment is distributed to states with more need. The capacity of an effective coordinating role looks to have dropped with Mandetta’s exit,” analyst Filipe Gruppelli Carvalho said.“Ultimately, Teich’s dismissal reinforces our view of increasing risks from the government’s poor response to the pandemic, which could contribute to a weaker presidency and decline in support for Bolsonaro in the post-pandemic phase,” he said. After Teich’s resignation was announced, pot-banging protests were heard in different regions of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bolsonaro-s-love-for-hydroxychloroquine-costs-brazil-another-health-minister/story-jkEFmRFR4sZYneLZxQjb1J.html

Addressing media, Trump said he is hopeful a Covid-19 vaccine would be available by the end of the year, and announced to appoint a former head of vaccines at GlaxoSmithKline to spearhead the effort as researchers around the world scramble to develop a vaccine for the coronavirus that has killed more than 300,000 people globally. “I just got back a short while ago from India recently and we are working very much with India and we have a tremendous Indian population in the US and many of the people that you are talking about are working on the vaccine too. Great scientist and researchers,” he told reporters in the Rose Garden of the White House as he unveiled a massive effort to speed track the development of coronavirus vaccine before year end. “Yes. We are working very closely also with India,” Trump said responding to a question. He described Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a “very good friend” of him. “India has been so great and as you know your Prime Minister has been a very good friend of mine,” Trump said and later on Twitter announced to donate ventilators to India. “I am proud to announce that the United States will donate ventilators to our friends in India,” he tweeted. “We stand with India” and Prime Minister Modi during this pandemic, he said. “We’re also cooperating on vaccine development. Together we will beat the invisible enemy!” Trump said. The White House did not immediately said as to the number of ventilators that the US is donating to India. This is for the first time probably that a president has recognized the scientific and research talent of the Indian American community. A large number of scientist are engaged in cutting edge research in various aspects of medical science including at the National Institute of Health, Universities, research institutes and bio pharma startups. There are an estimated four million Indian Americans in the United States, of which about 2.5 million are potential voters in the 2020 presidential elections this November. As a presidential candidate, Trump was the first nominee to hold a separate election rally for Indian American in October 2016 in New Jersey. Since then he has described himself as the best friend of India and Indian Americans at the White House.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-donates-ventilators-to-india-says-both-nations-will-defeat-pandemic/story-TmX6HGN6mxVDgfP5TLE3NO.html
16-05-2020||World||Wuhan starts ambitious drive to test its millions||Some eight million residents of Wuhan, the Chinese city where the coronavirus first emerged late last year, are undergoing the world’s largest mass testing for Covid-19.The campaign to test millions is being closely watched by countries all over the world because of its scale and feasibility. Three million Wuhan residents had already been tested since April, state media reported.The current tests are being carried out five weeks after Wuhan opened up on April 8 after a 76-day lockdown. Wuhan, a city of 11 million people, was badly affected by the outbreak, accounting for over 50,000 infections and around 3,800 deaths.The mass testing is part of China’s efforts to fortify against a potential “second wave” after a cluster of cases emerged in a residential community over the last weekend in Wuhan. Videos of long queues of people lining up in front of residential communities circulated on social media as testing began earlier this week.Medics dressed in protective gear could be seen guiding residents. Notices had been dispatched through local Communist Party of China volunteers to residential communities.Earlier this week, Wuhan authorities said all residents will be tested, but that announcement seems to have been recalibrated.Wuhan will “arrange nucleic acid tests for all residents who have not been tested before, in order to better know the number of asymptomatic cases of the novel coronavirus,” news agency Xinhua reported on Friday.The initial announcement that all tests will be carried out within 10 days has been tweaked as well. Each district of the city will now get 10 days to complete the tests.The decision to carry out large-scale testing was made as Wuhan continued to report asymptomatic infections daily. The priority for the tests are residents who have not been tested before, people living in residential compounds that had previous cases of the virus, as well as old or densely populated estates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wuhan-testing-millions-for-covid-19-in-complex-campaign/story-jSXybYhcWUPSuHAHHTGWVO.html
16-05-2020||India||Rahul meets migrant workers walking back home from Delhi||New Delhi: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Saturday interacted with a group of migrant workers on their way from Ambala in Haryana to Uttar Pradesh’s Jhansi near a flyover in Delhi’s Sukhdev Vihar before arranging transportation for them. He sat on a footpath with the migrants and interacted with them for over an hour, the Congress said and alleged the Delhi police later detained the workers citing a direction to do so. The police refuted the claim. “We have not detained any migrant. Rahul Gandhi came and interacted with the migrants. Later, his supporters took the migrants in their vehicles,” said deputy police commissioner (south-east Delhi) R P Meena.In a video the Congress released, Mahesh Kumar, one of the migrants, said their group of 13 migrants, including a child, was squatting on the footpath when Gandhi met them. “He asked us to speak about our problems. We told him that we do not have enough food and water. We have spent 50 days without much work and have worked for only 4-5 days in between,” he said. Kumar added that Gandhi promised to make arrangements for their return.The Congress said that the migrant workers worked at a factory in Ambala and were waiting for their dues to be paid. It added that the Congress’s Delhi and Uttar Pradesh units have been asked to facilitate their travel to Jhansi, around 500 km away. Gandhi has been critical of the government’s handling of the migrant crisis. On Saturday, he tweeted about the latest accident involving migrant workers in Uttar Pradesh’s Auraiya. “I am hurt by the news of the death of 24 labourers and the injuries to many people in UP’s Auraiya. I express my deepest condolences to the families of the deceased and hope the injured get well soon,” he tweeted.Migrant workers left jobless by the Covid-19 lockdown imposed in late March have continued to walk and cycle back to their homes even as buses have been arranged for them since late April and trains from May 1 onwards.

But care must be taken to safeguard our start-ups, which have enormous prospects, from being bought over,” said Air Vice Marshal Manmohan Bahadur (retd), additional director general, Centre for Air Power Studies.The minister said the list of weapons banned for import will be reviewed every year and more items will be added to it after discussions with the department of military affairs (DMA). This implies India will have to compulsorily develop technology for the defence systems and platforms figuring on the negative import list.One of the key responsibilities assigned by the government to the DMA, headed by chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat, is to promote the use of indigenous military equipment in the armed forces.Imports account for 60-65% of the country’s military requirements and it has signed contracts worth billions of dollars during the last decade for weapons and systems including fighter jets, air defence missile systems, submarine hunter planes, attack helicopters, heavy-lift choppers and lightweight howitzers.Sitharaman highlighted the need for the “realistic setting” of general staff qualitative requirements (GSQRs) of weapons and platforms. “Sometimes unrealistic quality requirements are set and quite a lot of time is spent in searching for suppliers who will meet all those requirements…you will end up with just one supplier and since buying from a single supplier is not permitted, you do the entire circle all over again,” she said. The minister also spoke about overhauling trials and testing procedures.GSQRs are the specifications put out by the armed forces for the equipment they need. “The point about having ‘realistic’ GSQRs is debatable; it is inconceivable that the forces are given equipment that doesn’t meet their operational requirements fully. Phase-wise development of a war fighting system is an accepted methodology but GSQRs must meet operational necessity in full,” said Air Vice Marshal Bahadur.The minister said the corporatisation of the OFB would help improve autonomy, accountability and efficiency in ordnance supplies.The Confederation of Indian Industry said the government’s focus on domestic manufacturing was encouraging as the country was among the largest importers of defence equipment in the world.CII director general Chandrajit Banerjee said: “The list of non-importable items and corporatisation of the OFB are some landmark steps and will boost the confidence of domestic manufacturers. The increase in FDI limit will attract foreign funds into this sector along with technology infusion.”India was the third-biggest military spender in the world last year after the United States and China, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri) said in a report released in April.Sitharaman also announced giving the private sector a role in India’s space programme, including in satellites, launches and space-based services. For boosting private participation in space activities, government will provide level playing field for private companies in satellites, launches and space-based services.Also, the government will provide predictable policy and regulatory environment to private players, she said.The private sector will be allowed to use ISRO’s facilities and other relevant assets to improve their capacities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-plans-higher-fdi-local-weapons-for-self-reliant-defence-sector/story-TkWwgfAwZuTnm70ek7xamL.html
16-05-2020||India||Cyclone Amphan to hit Odisha, WB||New Delhi: The deep depression over southeast Bay of Bengal has intensified into cyclonic storm, Amphan on Saturday evening. It is likely to intensify into a severe cyclonic storm, in the next couple of days, is expected to affect the West Bengal and adjoining Odisha coasts, the India Meteorological Department said on Saturday.It is likely to make landfall on West Bengal coast as a ‘very severe cyclonic storm’ on May 20 afternoon but the trajectory is still being studied closely by scientists who said details will be available on Sunday.The cyclonic storm is currently lying about 1040 km south of Paradip, Odisha; 1200 km south-southwest of Digha in West Bengal and 1300 km south-southwest of Khepupara in Bangladesh.It will intensify into a severe cyclonic storm during the next 12 hours (by May 17) and further intensify into a very severe cyclonic storm during the subsequent 24 hours by May 18. “It is very likely to move north-northwestwards initially till May 17 and then recurve north-northeastwards across northwest Bay of Bengal towards West Bengal and adjoining Odisha coasts during May 18 and 20,” IMD’s Cyclone Warning Division said on Saturday.Fishermen are advised not to venture into south Bay of Bengal between May 16 and 17, to central Bay of Bengal between May 17 and 18 and north Bay of Bengal between May 19 and 20. Fishermen are also advised not to venture into north Bay of Bengal along and off North Odisha, West Bengal and adjoining Bangladesh coast between May 18 and 20.“For now we know that the cyclone is moving towards West Bengal and adjoining Odisha coasts. We will give details of landfall location on Sunday morning and an evacuation strategy can be made after that. State governments are being alerted. It may make landfall on West Bengal coast,” said M Mohapatra, director general, IMD.“Adverse weather can be expected in Odisha and West Bengal coastal areas between May 18 and 20. These states are under pre-cyclone watch. Actions to be taken will be decided tomorrow as we get more details of its trajectory. For now, the cyclone is expected to intensify into a severe cyclonic storm and move towards West Bengal and adjoining Odisha coasts,” said Sunita Devi, IMD scientist in-charge for cyclones.Squally wind speed reaching 45 to 55 kmph, gusting to 65 kmph is prevailing over southeast and adjoining southwest Bay of Bengal currently. It is likely to increase to 90-100 kmph, gusting to 110 kmph over eastcentral and adjoining west central Bay of Bengal by May 17 morning, 120-130kmph, gusting to 145 kmph over southern parts of central Bay of Bengal by May 18 morning, 155-165 kmph, gusting to 180 kmph over northern parts of central Bay of Bengal and adjoining north Bay of Bengal on May 19, and 160-170 kmph, gusting to 190 kmph over north Bay of Bengal by May 20.Sea condition will be high (6-9 meters wave height/34-47 knots wind) over southwest and adjoining central Bay of Bengal from the May 16 night, very high (9-14 metres wave height /38-63 knots wind) over the same region from May 17 morning. It will become phenomenal (over 14 metres wave height/64 knots) over southern parts of central Bay of Bengal on May 18, over northern parts of central Bay of Bengal and adjoining north Bay of Bengal on May 19 and over north Bay of Bengal on May 20, according to IMD’s statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cyclone-amphan-to-hit-odisha-wb/story-z0mIS2jnGUKnAWce6IBWVP.html

District Collectors should prepare lists of stranded labour & destination and apply to Railways through the State nodal officer,” the Railways minister tweeted.“Along with this, the District Collectors should give a list and destination to the State Nodal Officer of Railways,” he said.Over the last few days, Goyal has been appealing to state governments to approve more trains to ferry migrants to their home states. The appeal has gone out specially to states like Jharkhand, Rajasthan and West Bengal.However, it is not clear how the steps prescribed by the minister on Saturday are different from the present protocol where lists of such workers are prepared at the district level as well.In a press release issued later in the day, the ministry indicated that the Railways hopes this process will ensure maximum utilisation of rakes.“Once the information about migrants wishing to go back to their home states is made available from each district, the Indian Railways can take further action to help operationalise the trains.“Railways is presently running less than half of its capacity. It can transport many more migrants safely and quickly,” it said. The national carrier has the capacity to run almost 300 ‘Shramik Special’ trains a day, it said.“Full capacity operationalisation of the railways rakes would provide significant relief to the migrants across the country who are seeking to go to their home states. The Indian Railways is ready to augment the running of ‘Shramik Special’ trains as per the actual needs of the districts,” it said.As on Saturday, more than 15 lakh migrants have already been transported by the Railways to their home states and almost 1,150 ‘Shramik Special’ trains operationalised.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/railways-ready-to-run-shramik-special-trains-from-any-district-piyush-goyal/story-XCm0JrOAlCBkbxW29rdOCM.html
16-05-2020||India||30 cities should have maximum restrictions in lockdown 4.0: Official||Thirty municipal areas including Mumbai, Delhi and Kolkata that account for nearly 80% of India’s coronavirus cases should have the maximum restrictions under the Home Ministry’s lockdown 4.0 ground rules, the health ministry has told the government.The third round of the lockdown, first imposed on March 24 midnight, is due to end on Sunday night.There is no word on the extent of the restrictions that would be imposed in lockdown 4.0. The ground rules for the next round would be made public on Sunday.The last version of the lockdown that came into effect from 4 May had introduced considerable relaxations in districts that had not reported Covid-19 cases and eased restrictions elsewhere. The Centre’s objective, starting from the first round of relaxations from 21 April, has been to gradually resume economic activity.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had this week told chief ministers that the Centre would opt for another spell of the national lockdown but made it clear that lockdown 4.0 would be very different from the earlier three versions. He had also indicated that this time, the Centre would give a long rope to the states to decide how to ease the restrictions.The rules for lockdown 4.0 have been designed to give a hard push to resumption of economic activity but continue some of the restrictions in municipal areas that have reported a large proportion of the restrictions. These 30 municipalities are spread across 12 states. Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu account for over one-third of these municipalities. Gujarat and Rajasthan have three cities each in this list and West Bengal, two.Covid-19 hotspots: 30 municipal areasMaharashtra : Brihanmumbai, Thane, Pune, Solapur, Nashik, Aurangabad and PalgharTamil Nadu : Greater Chennai, Tiruvallur, Cuddalore, Chengalpattu, Ariyalur and VillupuramGujarat : Ahmedabad, Surat, VadodaraRajasthan : Jaipur, Jodhpur and UdaipurWest Bengal : Kolkata and HowrahMadhya Pradesh : Indore and BhopalUttar Pradesh : Agra and MeerutTelangana : Greater HyderabadAndhra Pradesh : KurnoolPunjab : AmritsarOdisha : BerhampurDelhiThe government’s renewed focus on the urban areas comes in context of data that suggests these 30 cities are home to most of the country’s Covid-19 case.On Saturday, Health Secretary Preeti Sudan held a special meeting with municipal and health officials from the 12 states where the 30 municipal corporations are located. The meeting discussed the high risk factors and reviewed indices such as confirmation rate, fatality rate, doubling rate, tests per million for these places. She also updated the states about the health ministry’s new guidelines aimed at such urban settlements, particularly informal settlements such as Mumbai’s Dharavi slums.Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and Delhi account for nearly 68 per cent of India’s 86,000 Covid cases.On Saturday, Maharashtra reported 1,600 new cases, one of the highest single-day spikes, pushing the state’s total to 30,706.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/30-cities-should-have-maximum-restrictions-in-lockdown-4-0-official/story-h5L4mMoIJ0XCPF0piYYVMP.html
16-05-2020||India||Centre lifts restriction on export of woven masks||Almost two months into the lockdown, the government on Saturday eased some restrictions on the exports of masks, allowing woven ones to be exported. The move follows a long term demand of the textile industry.     The Directorate General of Foreign Trade in a circular on Saturday, modified its March 31 order and allowed the export of non-medical and non-surgical masks made of woven cloth such as silk, wool and cotton, as well as knitted ones. All other types of masks under the Indian Trade Clarification based on Harmonised System of Coding will continue to remain prohibited for exports, the circular said.     On January 31,the government had banned the exports of all categories of PPEs in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic but lifted the ban on February 8, inviting widespread criticism from the Opposition. The textile ministry said that it did so after it was assured by the industry of adequate supply of 2-ply and 3-ply surgical masks at reasonable prices.  Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageThe ban on exports was re-imposed on March 19. The three kinds of masks made in India are differentiated by melt blown fabric, which ministry officials defined as a “critical component”. N95 and N99 masks, which are used by health-workers and Covid patients in hospitals, as well as two and three-plymasks used in surgeries are non-woven and made of melt blown fabric.  “There is a shortage of melt blown fabric the world over, not just in India, and we cannot part with the masks made of the material at this critical point,” an official said.        Days before the lockdown was announced on March 24, key government officials in a meeting helmed by the textiles secretary on March 18 pegged the shortage of 10.5 lakh N95 masks and 10 lakh masks. Since then India has reached the capacity to produce 2 lakh N95 masks daily, Prime Minister Modi said during his address to the nation on May 12. Ashok Juneja of the Textile Association of India said that since the garment industry does not have any orders, the move will help generate income. “The woven ones are washable and can be reused, and in the near future, the usage of masks will increase,” said Juneja.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-lifts-restriction-on-export-of-woven-masks/story-cU5Gml4MREEZ7gOPqGDSoN.html

Jena explained that the passengers who come to Odisha by other Shramik Special trains to the western and the southern regions of the state will have to remain in quarantine centres on their arrival and later be shifted to their native places after the cyclone is over.Apart from Shramik Special trains, the Indian Railways has also started operating special passenger trains between New Delhi and Bhubaneswar. Jena, however, did not say anything about the other trains scheduled to reach the coastal region between May 17 and 20 when the cyclone is likely to make impact. Meanwhile, the state government has put 12 coastal districts - Gajapati, Ganjam, Puri, Khurda, Jajpur, Nayagarh, Balasore, Bhadrak, Kendrapara, Jagatsinghpur, Mayurbhanj and Cuttack on alert for cyclone. Of the 12 districts, the state government as per the forecast of the India Meteorological Department (IMD), has identified the four districts like Jagatsinghpur, Kendrapara, Balasore and Bhadrak as prone to the impending cyclone, which is likely to impact the state between May 18 to 20.Sources in the chief secretary’s office said the cabinet secretary has assured the state all assistance like use of chopper, deployment of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), Coast Guard and others whenever necessary.“As per the predicted path of the cyclone till now, around seven lakh people in 649 villages along the sea coast are likely to be severely affected. “The standing crop in lakh hectare particularly, ripe summer paddy, pulses and oil seeds, cashew, mango, coconuts and vegetables are likely to be damaged in the heavy rainfall and wind,” Tripathy informed in the video conference.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-urges-centre-to-temporarily-suspend-shramik-special-trains-due-to-impending-cyclone/story-4iB28N2enLJR2ED2wAzrnI.html

Without any social dialogue, the government is bringing gross changes and is going in the wrong direction,” BMS general secretary Vrijesh Upadhyay said in a statement.It has also cautioned that allowing private companies a role in India’s space programme and access to ISRO facilities to improve their capacities will have “serious consequences” for national security. “We depend on space for many security and surveillance measures which are dangerous to be privatized,” Upadhaya said.Also Read: Private firms to get access to ISRO’s facilities, space exploration opportunitiesWhile announcing the fourth tranche of measures to rev up the economy, Sitharaman said FDI cap through the automatic route will be raised from 49% to 74%, subject to security clearances in the defence sector; and the government will allow private players in commercial mining of coal, privatisation of power discoms in the Union Territories.

Putting 6 airports to auction for getting Rs 13,000 crore and privatization of discoms is detrimental to India in the long run,” Upadhyay said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rss-affiliated-labour-union-slams-sitharaman-s-reforms-claims-govt-is-going-in-wrong-direction/story-rAq2GawPO7fG0hmE2qDiHP.html

We seek permission to run these 1,000 buses,” read a statement from Priyanka Gandhi’s office. In a separate development, the Centre said it has developed an online national migrant information system to capture the movement of stranded labourers heading home and to further facilitate their travel.Earlier in the day, 24 migrant labourers were killed and several injured after the truck they were travelling in collided with another truck in Uttar Pradesh’s Auraiya district.CM Yogi Adityanath on Friday asked state officials to set up teams in every police station area to ensure that no migrant worker travels on foot or bike or in any unsafe mode in Uttar Pradesh.The directive came amid rising cases of migrants losing their lives in road accidents while marching back home.The CM said food and water should be provided to the migrants as soon as they enter the state and added that they should be medically screened. Arrangements for a vehicle to send them to their respective destinations should be made if they are found fit, the CM told officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/priyanka-gandhi-seeks-nod-to-run-1-000-buses-to-send-migrants-home-in-up/story-1Xp5WSCLIsdvGFNgPyYu4J.html
16-05-2020||India||Centre issues guidelines to urban local bodies to contain Covid-19||The Union ministry of health and family welfare released a document on Saturday delineating focus areas that need to be addressed by the urban local bodies for preparedness in these settlements for responding to Covid-19 the country’s tally in the pandemic reached 86,000.Among the measures that the ministry of health and family welfare underlined for urban settlements for prevention and control of Covid-19 are institutional mechanism, incident response system, coordination mechanism, Covid-19 containment plan, surveillance, hospital preparedness and clinical management, pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical intervention.The government said that these urban localities are often overcrowded, with many people crammed into very small living spaces. A substantial percentage of this population is migrant workers employed in the industrial and other informal sector.Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverage“These areas are characterized by poor structural quality of housing, inadequate access to safe water, poor sanitation and insecure residential status. There are gaps in health and healthcare services,” the document said. It acknowledged that in the context of Covid (or any other respiratory infectious disease for that matter) implementing strategic interventions such as surveillance, physical distancing, isolation, quarantine and communicating the risk to the dwellers could be challenging. It also cautioned that social distancing will be a major challenge due to many people crammed into very small living spaces. It said social distancing should be practiced particularly in community water points, public toilets, PDS distribution points, health centers etc. It called for social distancing to be promoted at all formal and informal gatherings. The document also said a quarantine facility (school, stadium, etc.) in a nearby area needs to be identified, where a large number of high risk contacts can be accommodated. Shifting of high risk contacts (elderly and those with co-morbid conditions) is a crucial intervention to minimize the spread of disease in such persons, thereby limiting morbidity and mortality among them. A contingency plan will also be in place to move high risk populations to alternate or temporary sites.It stressed on the use of masks should be made mandatory and said common mask distribution sites and disposal sites should be identified and all dwellers may be made aware about the same.Community cleaning and disinfection drive needs to be undertaken on a daily basis. In particular, the community toilets need to be cleaned at-least three to four times a day. The civil dispensaries, health posts, health and family welfare centers will also be used as depot holder for Hydroxychloroquine, masks household disinfectants etc. It said community groups are key to creating awareness on Covid among these populations. “Use of local (political, religious and opinion) leaders for communicating all aspects of the Covid prevention and control is vital as dwellers are more inclined to trust them. Under these leaders, community cadres need to be created for community engagement,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-issues-guidelines-to-urban-local-bodies-to-contain-covid-19/story-mnK9v15CL81n2eSzSLl48I.html

16-05-2020||India||Online database for migrants to monitor their movement, help with travel||The Centre on Saturday said it has developed an online National Migrant Information System (NMIS) to track the movement of stranded labourers heading home and to further facilitate their travel. “This system will help in speedy communication between states without creating additional work at the level of the field officers. It has additional advantages like contact tracing, which may be useful in overall Covid-19 response work,” read the order from the ministry of home affairs. Amid a nationwide lockdown necessitated by the coronavirus outbreak, hundreds of migrants, for days together now, have been walking or hitchhiking their way to homes.“The portal will work as a central repository and help in sending as well as receiving state/district to ask for and give their acceptance in an online format seamlessly,” the order said.The states will be able to visualise how many people are going out from where and how many are reaching destination states. The mobile numbers of the people will be used for contact tracing and movement monitoring. Earlier in the day, 24 migrant labourers were killed and several injured after the truck they were travelling in collided with another truck in Uttar Pradesh’s Auraiya district. On May 8 in another incident, 16 migrant labourers were crushed to death by a goods train in Maharashtra after they fell asleep on the tracks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/online-database-for-migrants-to-monitor-their-movement-help-with-travel/story-Ofq0lcuHqODtusAxQxirOJ.html
16-05-2020||India||Kerala reports 11 new Covid-19 cases||Kerala has reported 11 new coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases, said state health minister KK Shailaja on Saturday while sounding a word of caution that the third phase of the pandemic would be critical for the state.Kerala has been preparing for a spike in Covid-19 positive cases, as those stranded abroad, mostly from the West Asian nations, are being evacuated by the central government under Operation Vande Bharat – the largest evacuation operation since the invasion of Kuwait by the then Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein in August 1990.The state has reported 587 Covid-19 positive cases so far, of which 87 are still active.North Kerala’s Wayanad and Kasaragod have emerged as hotspots.A truck driver and a Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader have become the latest superspreaders. The driver came back from Chennai’s Koyembedu vegetable market, a Covid-19 hotspot, and infected 10 others with SARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease, and the CPI(M) leader, who had sneaked into neighbouring Karnataka to bring back one of his relatives, infected eight others, said health officials.“People slacken when restrictions are relaxed. This is not a good sign. Now, we’ve to be more vigilant even though we’ve to live with the virus. We managed the first two phases well. Our mortality rate, which is less than 1%, is the best in the world. However, we shouldn’t lower our guard. The third phase is critical for the state,” Shailaja said.Kerala is the first state in the country to report a Covid-19 positive case on January 30, when an infected medical student returned from China.The second phase occurred during the first week of March, when a few people, who came from abroad violated home quarantine norms and infected others.The state had successfully contained the viral outbreak with its track, trace, and treat methodology. But the third phase will be the most challenging as several stranded people are now returning to the state and 60% among the latest 80 Covid-19 positive cases are imported.At least 3,750 people returned by 17 international flights and three ships to the state in the last week from the Persian Gulf nations and the Maldives. Similarly 40,000 people stranded in other parts of the country returned to the state in the past 10 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-reports-11-new-covid-19-cases/story-Kt4Pv9riCj5v33BnsTgvoL.html

Such a situation will result in many stalled projects resulting in huge losses for all the stakeholders especially homebuyers,” he added.Speaking with the stakeholders of the real estate sector in a webinar titled ‘3rd anniversary of RERA’, Puri said the principal objective of RERA is to help restore the trust between a buyer and the seller by effective implementation of the act.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19“This would not only help ease the burden of inventory pile-up in the sector, but also provide the necessary financial cushion to the developers to complete pending projects,” he said.During the initial period of the lockdown, construction activities were barred. After reviewing the situation, the Government has put in place certain measures to allow for construction activities, effective from April 20 onward, he said. Referring to the announcement made by the finance minister Friday to provide affordable rental housing to migrant labourers and urban poor, Puri said the Affordable Rental Housing Complex (ARHC) scheme, where Government-funded houses in cities, will be converted into Affordable Rental Housing Complex under the PPP model. “This single step will, to a great extent, alleviate the problem of providing temporary housing to migrant people who are stranded in several urban areas. The Credit Link Subsidy Scheme (CLSS) under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana - Urban (PMAY-U) for middle-income group has been extended to 31st March 2021, which is likely to benefit 2.5 lakh middle-class people.

He said the closure of temples has also adversely impacted the economic condition of priests and demanded special financial package for them.In his letter to the Prime Minister, Pathak said the religious sites can be reopened with some restrictions under the present circumstances. The government has banned congregations and closed temples and other religious sites, besides schools, colleges, malls and factories, to check the spread of the novel coronavirus, which has infected more than 85,000 people and killed over 2,750 in the country so far. Pathak said India is perhaps facing the “wrath of deities” as they have been treated “at par with factories” during the ongoing lockdown. “Coronavirus is an asur (demon) and it can only be killed by divine forces. I am quite sure divinity would rescue devotees from the coronavirus after joint prayers,” he told reporters here. He said the closure of temples and shrines has widened the distance between gods and devotees, and the separation cannot be erased through prayers at home. He said though the portals of ‘Char Dham’ temples have been opened in Uttarakhand, entry of devotees has been banned. “The deities provide solace to a disturbed mind,” he said and demanded that devotees be allowed there. The opening of the temples under a guideline would also provide some financial support to priests who have been badly hit by the coronavirus-triggered lockdown. The organisation has requested the Prime Minister to bring priests and ‘pandas’ (religious guides) under the umbrella of an economic package being provided by the government to different categories of people. A copy of the letter has been sent to Union Home Minister Amit Shah, Pathak said. The lockdown was first announced by Prime Minister Modi on March 24 for 21 days in a bid to combat the coronavirus pandemic. It was first extended till May 3 and again till May 17.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-demon-can-only-be-killed-by-divine-forces-priest-body-urges-pm-to-reopen-temples/story-sikwTUhOEZDwx9W4MG8D9O.html

The SaveLife Foundation, a non-profit organisation working towards curbing road accidents in the country, has recorded nearly 2,000 road crashes and 368 deaths from March 25 when the lockdown began to May 16 (11 am).Of these, 139 deaths are of migrants travelling back home, 27 of essential workers and 202 of others, it said. “Of the total 368 deaths reported, over 100 were recorded from Uttar Pradesh alone. The top five states in this tally include Madhya Pradesh (30), Telangana (22), Maharashtra (19) and Punjab (17). The most common factor for these road crashes was speeding,” SaveLife Foundation CEO Piyush Tewari told PTI.As the numbers spiralled, slowly, steadily and then in what appeared to be a torrent, a pattern emerged. Many of the tragedies occurred in the dark, which is when it is cooler to walk, and many people were caught in their sleep.That’s what happened on Saturday too, when a trailer rammed into a stationary truck in the pre-dawn darkness around 3.30 am on a highway near Auraiya in Uttar Pradesh, killing at least 24 people and injuring 36. The vehicles, one headed from Delhi to Madhya Pradesh and the other to Rajasthan, were ferrying labourers to their homes, Some of the workers had stopped for tea and others were possibly sleeping by the roadside or in the vehicles when the crash occurred. Most of those killed were from Jharkhand and West Bengal, and some from Kushinagar in eastern Uttar Pradesh, officials said as reports suggested that some of the victims may have been crushed under cement bags loaded in one of the vehicles.A few hours later, tragedy unfolded in Sagar, Madhya Pradesh, when five migrant workers going from Maharashtra to Uttar Pradesh were killed when a truck carrying them overturned on the Sagar-Kanpur Road.The combination of no traffic and speeding vehicles has led to havoc, endangering the lives of those who found themselves without work or money in the coronavirus-induced lockdown and were frantic to get home, any which way. Over this week alone, there have been multiple accidents reported from Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.In Guna, Madhya Pradesh, for instance, as many as 14 migrants were killed and around 60 injured in two different road accidents on Thursday and Friday.On Friday, six migrant workers were killed and 95 injured in separate road accidents across Uttar Pradesh.And the day before, six migrant workers walking from Punjab to Bihar were killed in Muzaffarnagar in the state when they were hit by a roadways bus on the Delhi-Saharanpur Highway, officials said.With no compass to guide them on their treacherous inter-state journey home and perhaps to escape the police, many people also walk along railway tracks. On May 8, it cost 16 lives.In perhaps the most gruesome of accidents, 16 migrant workers going to Madhya Pradesh were mowed down by freight train when they dozed off on the tracks near Aurangabad in Maharashtra. In a chilling reflection of the hunger and deprivation that led the group of 20 men working in a steel unit in Jalna – four of them survived – the ‘rotis’ they had packed to see them through the journey lay scattered on the tracks.The same morning, hundreds of kilometres away, a migrant labourer couple, Krishna Sahu (45) and his wife Pramila (40), were run over by an unidentified vehicle on their way from Lucknow to Chhattisgarh. The couple, on a bicycle, were with their two children, both under five years, who survived the crash. Reduced to statistics as they undertake their own personal odysseys, challenging the odds but not always triumphing them, there was a back story everywhere.Some lockdown induced road accidents were reported as early as March 28 when four migrants were run over by a truck on the Maharashtra-Gujarat border. According to Indian Express, the four, part of a group of seven which wanted to reach their villages in Rajasthan after crossing into Gujarat, had just begun walking after taking some rest when a truck came from behind and rammed into them. Two days later, 40-year-old labourer Sukh Lal Ahirwar died in Gwalior in Madhya Pradesh after a car hit him. Ahirwar and his wife had walked for two straight days from Delhi towards their home in Tikamgarh in Madhya Pradesh and were resting on a road divider when the accident took place, reported the Hindi daily Nayi Duniya.Those who survive have no option but continue the journey.Like the group of 20 labourers who left in a tempo from Mumbai to Lucknow on May 10.   The 1,400-km journey had barely begun when the tempo met with an accident, killing their driver. The driver had spoken to the news channel NDTV just hours earlier.“There are lots of problems. We don’t have anything to eat. We had rations till now, so we were eating that. Now, we are heading out. We will travel somehow in this,” one of those in the group told the channel. There were also reports of a woman and her six-year-old daughter who were part of a group travelling between Maharashtra and Jaunpur in Uttar Pradesh in an autorickshaw.  They had travelled almost 1,300 km when the autorickshaw was hit by a truck just short of their destination in Fatehpur.The Railways has organised “Shramik Special trains” and ferried at least 12 lakh migrants to their homes since May 1.“To bring back the workers till date, the Railways has operated 1,034 Shramik Special trains. Out of which 106 were operated yesterday (Friday). Uttar Pradesh and Bihar has taken steps positively and 80 per cent of the total Shramik Special trains have been operated by these two states,” Union minister Piyush Goyal tweeted on Saturday.But if the thousands of workers and their families still trudging their way home, however they can, is any indication, it might be too little too late. India accounts for one of the highest road crashes fatalities in the world with an estimated 1.5 lakh people killed in about five lakh accidents a year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/courting-death-and-injury-scores-of-migrants-killed-in-accidents-on-way-home/story-HgPUI1yi7SUACcIyw3ru5N.html
16-05-2020||India||A bus from Assam to Goa: State goes to lengths to bring stranded residents back||Come Saturday evening, a bus will set off from Darjeeling in West Bengal with a sole passenger before picking up four from Kolkata for a 2,800 kilometre long journey back to Goa. This exemplifies the difficulty faced by the Goa government in bringing back the stranded residents that are scattered across the country but not in large numbers to warrant booking of special trains being run by the Indian Railways. Therefore, the government has begun dispatching buses both private and those run by the state transport corporation to bring stranded Goans home. The movement is being coordinated by the interstate movement cell set up for the purpose. So the bus mentioned above was dispatched to West Bengal earlier this week and arrived in Darjeeling on Friday to pick up a single passenger from a place near Assam border before heading to Kolkata on Saturday to pick up four others for a journey from one edge of the country to the other. Another bus has left Goa for Baleshwar (Balasore), Orissa.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19More than 6,200 persons have asked for assistance to return home. While most evacuation trips are of a shorter duration and involve bringing back students from Kerala or neighbouring Karnataka, the Kadamba Transport Corporation buses have travelled even to Udaipur in Rajasthan and Ratlam in Madhya Pradesh to bring back stranded residents. The latter was an exchange trip in which students of the Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya, Delhi were dropped and JNV students from Goa picked up from Ratlam-- identified as the midpoint for the exchange. “The movement of buses is planned judiciously in consultation with nodal officials of different states,” the state government said in a statement. “Once they register on the Goa government portal, those wishing to be brought back are informed through SMS/calls by the control room once the travel plan for a particular destination is finalised,” the state government said. Besides this, over the last week, 15 buses have brought back 241 people from Kerala (Kasargod), Karnataka (Mangluru, Bengaluru, Belgaum,Hubli, Dharwad, Khanapur, Jamboti and Gadag), Maharashtra (Navi Mumbai, Pune), Gujarat (Ahmedabad,Vadodara and Surat), Dadra and Nagar Haveli.“Driving a Volvo is relaxing. However, crossing the state borders, changing routes due to blockages in Red Zones, waiting in long queues for several security checks was hectic. This will be indeed an unforgettable experience,” Savlo Parab, 55, a driver of the KTCL who drove to Ratlam, said. The journeys are fraught with risk as was evidenced when a Goa bound bus that was returning from Chennai via Bengaluru met with an accident injuring 21 passengers on board after the driver allegedly dozed off at 4:30 am in Gadag, Karnataka. However, the Goa government is confident its efforts are worth it. “Today, I am proud and feel more responsible. The government has arranged the trip well. Each person was provided with masks and sanitizers, food and other essentials. We did not halt anywhere except for food. Their zeal to be in their motherland was also a constant motivation for us,” Mahesh Khanolkar, 45, another driver said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-bus-from-assam-to-goa-state-goes-to-lengths-to-bring-stranded-residents-back/story-bQawOaT1CHuKVTxyo1WlfM.html

Of them, 700 tested positive and were isolated,” said Additional Chief Secretary Rajiv Gupta, who has been appointed to oversee works related to COVID-19 in Ahmedabad.Shops selling essential items reopened from May 15 on certain conditions in Ahmedabad which had been under a complete lockdown since May 7.“Even as grocery shops and vegetable vendors were allowed to resume their business from May 15, provided they carried health screening cards, at least 700 ‘super spreaders’ were isolated after around 12,500 people were tested for coornavirusinfection in a week-long exercise,” a senior official said.Before that about 350 “super spreaders” were detected to have contracted the viral infection in a campaign launched on April 20.Gupta said massive screening was conducted to ensure that the viral infection cannot get transmitted from the “super spreaders”.He appealed to citizens to buy only from vendors or shopkeepers who carry “health screening cards”.“These ‘super spreaders’ will have to renew their cards after 14 days,”he said.Gupta further said the situation was normalising on the front of supply of essential commodities, including grocery items and vegetables. He said these items are supplied in ample quantities after the week-long lockdown was lifted on Friday.Grocery shops and vegetable/fruit vendors can operate their business between 8 am and 3 pm.Besides, the AMC also allowed shops to remain open for a few hours in ten containment zones in the city.Ahmedabad reported 7,044 coronavirus positive cases, and 473 deaths, as per the data available on May 15 night.The number of active cases is 4,260 and that of discharged people is 2,311.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-least-700-super-spreaders-found-coronavirus-positive-in-a-week-in-ahmedabad/story-0sLYKcSnubV5JfvrXXiztK.html

Telangana has alleged that AP is drawing up to eight tmc (thousand million cubic feet) of water from the Krishna river daily. The board also cited that it had written two more letters to the AP government on earlier occasions this year – January 1 and May 13 – seeking the DPRs. However, the AP government is yet to furnish the details, it added.Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014, stipulates that no new projects on Godavari and Krishna rivers can be taken up either by the Telangana or Andhra Pradesh governments without obtaining sanction from the Apex Council on River Water Resources.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-asks-andhra-to-stop-construction-of-new-schemes-on-krishna-river/story-Cl4emPCpuGJcsBxMnSAGML.html

This, she said, will help the aluminium industry reduce electricity costs.She said the distinction between captive and non-captive mines will be removed to allow the transfer of mining leases and sale of surplus unused minerals, leading to better efficiency and production. It means mines whose rights have been purchased by one miner for captive purposes can be transferred to another party that wants to take over for a non-captive reason. A captive mine is one in which the miner has to necessarily use the mineral for their own purposes.Sitharaman said the government will also rationalise the stamp duty payable at the time of award of mining leases.The announcements were part of the fourth tranche details of the Rs 20 lakh crore package announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his address to the nation on May 12, vowing to make India atmanirbhar or self-reliant.The finance minister held her first press conference to share details of the stimulus package on Wednesday. The second and third phase of announcements on Centre’s economic package were made on Thursday and Friday.Her last press conference will be on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fm-nirmala-sitharaman-announces-reforms-to-boost-growth-jobs-in-mineral-sector/story-X09KZ5ypI8WOUpFO6PpzAJ.html

16-05-2020||India||Congress claims migrants detained after meet with Rahul Gandhi; police deny||The Congress on Saturday claimed that some migrant labourers were taken in preventive custody soon after their interaction with former party president Rahul Gandhi.The Congress alleged that the police had told them they had orders to do so. The Delhi police, however, refuted the claim. “We have not detained any migrant. Rahul Gandhi came and interacted with migrants. Later, his supporters took the migrants in their vehicles,” DCP South East RP Meena said. Gandhi interacted with the migrant workers near the flyover in Delhi’s Sukhdev Vihar hours after he spoke with journalists from the regional press. Party leaders said that Gandhi arranged for them to be sent home.Watch | Rahul Gandhi meets migrants on road; Congress says they’re detained, cops deny Rahul Gandhi, dressed in a white kurta and black trousers, with his face mask was seen interacting with a group of migrants. The Congress leader, sitting on the sidewalk, was seen holding a conversation with the group, which had a few women, children and men. He, according to party leaders, interacted with them for over an hour. The migrants were travelling from Ambala to Jhansi.In a video released by the party, one of the migrants Mahesh Kumar said that a group of 13 migrants, including a child were squatting on a footpath when Gandhi came. “He asked us to speak about our problems, we told him that we do not have enough food and water. We have spent 50 days without a steady stream of work, and have worked for only 4-5 days in between,” he said, adding that Gandhi promised to make arrangements for their return.The migrants were working at a factory at Ambala, and were waiting for their dues to be paid, said the Congress. Congress party leaders said that Gandhi called party workers from the Delhi unit and asked them to facilitate their travel. “The DPCC workers were asked to take the migrants to the UP border, and the UP state unit has been alerted to take them to the UP-MP border. The MP unit will then take them to their homes in the Jhansi area,” a leader said. Gandhi has been vocally critical of the government’s handling of the migrant crisis, and on Saturday tweeted about the death of 24 migrants in an accident at UP’s Auraiya.“I am hurt by the news of the death of 24 labourers and the injuries to many people in UP’s Auraiya. I express my deepest condolences to the families of the deceased and hope the injured get well soon,” Gandhi tweeted.Amid a nationwide lockdown, hundreds of migrants, for days together now, have been walking or hitchhiking their way to homes.

16-05-2020||India||Structural reforms in 8 key sectors to boost economy, says FM Sitharaman||Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday announced the fourth tranche of the Rs 20 lakh crore economic stimulus package focussing on structural reforms in various crucial sectors of the Indian economy. The reforms will provide an impetus to those sectors which are new areas of growth, unleash new investment opportunities, lead to more production and in turn generate more jobs, the minister said. “We are going to focus on a total of eight sectors today -- Coal, Minerals, Defence Production, Air Space Management and Airports, MROs, Power Distribution Companies, Space and Atomic Energy,” Sitharaman said at the daily news briefing to announce the Centre’s detailed economic package. “Many sectors need policy simplification, to make it simpler for people to understand what the sector can give, participate in activities and bring about transparency. Once we decongest these sectors, we can boost the sector, for growth and additional jobs,” the finance minister said. Incentive schemes for the promotion of New Champion Sectors will also be launched in Solar PV manufacturing and advanced cell battery storage among others.ALSO READ | FDI in defence sector hiked from 49% to 74%, says FM Nirmala SitharamanReferring to inclusiveness for states, the minister said states would be ranked on investment opportunities and the ability to attract new investments. “Schemes will be implemented in states through challenge mode for Industrial Cluster Upgradation of common infrastructure facilities and connectivity,” the finance minister said. In a consolidated effort towards a self-reliant India, policy reforms will be put on fast track and the ease of doing business will be further upgraded. Announcing the introduction of commercial mining in the coal sector, Sitharaman said, “The government will introduce competition, transparency, and private sector participation in the Coal sector through revenue sharing mechanism instead of the regime of fixed rupee per tonne.”“Commercial mining is being introduced in the coal sector and the age-old government monopoly is being removed. The commercial mining of coal will be done on a revenue sharing basis. An amount of Rs 50,000 crore is being provided for evacuation infrastructure in the coal sector,” Sitharaman said.ALSO READ | Govt will notify list of weapons for ban on import with year wise timelines: SitharamanRegulations are required when there is a shortage of raw material. Coal is not environment-friendly and it needs to be kept in mind that the country’s environment commitments are honoured while converting coal into gas or other fuel, the minister said. At least 500 mining blocks would be offered through an open and transparent auction process for the commercial mining initiative. There will also be a joint auction of bauxite and coal mineral blocks to enhance the Aluminum industry’s competitiveness.“The investment of Rs. 50,000 crore is for the evacuation of enhanced CIL’s (Coal India Limited) target of 1 billion tonnes of coal production by 2023-24 plus coal production from private blocks,” the finance minister said.There will be rationalisation of stamp duty payable at the time of awarding mining leases. The distinction between the captive and non- captive mines will be removed to allow transfer of mining leases and sale of surplus unused minerals in the Mineral sector. The Ministry of Mines is in the process of creating a Mining Index for different minerals as part of the structural reforms.In defence production, the finance minister said for self-reliance a list of weapons and platforms will be notified and a ban imposed on import with year-wise timelines. There will be indigenisation of imported spares so that defence equipment is both made and bought in India“We shall notify a list of weapons and platforms that will not be allowed for import…these will be banned and have to be bought in India. Those list of items which will be notified can now only be bought in India by the defence sector. To improve the autonomy accountability we intend to start corporatization of ordinance factory boards for better management and for subsequent listing on the stock market,” the minister said.Foreign Direct Investment limit in defence manufacturing under the automatic route is being raised from 49% to 74%, the government has decided.In Civil Aviation, Sitharaman indicated that “Restrictions on the utilisation of Indian Air Space will be eased so that civilian flying becomes more efficient. We will bring a total benefit of Rs 1000 crore per year for the aviation sector.”A total of six airports will be up for auction by the Airports Authority of India (AAI) and it will be done on a Public Private Partnership basis. India will also be promoted as a MRO hub to save on additional costs for the aviation sector.Sitharaman on Saturday also announced that electricity distribution companies in Union Territories (UTs) will be privatised. A tariff policy that does not burden consumers with distribution companies’ inefficiencies will be guaranteed, she said while presenting the fourth tranche of the economic stimulus package.She also announced a hike in viability gap funding (VGF) for development of social infrastructure. In her fourth tranche of economic stimulus, she said Rs 8,100 crore will be provided as viability gap funding for development of social infrastructure.The finance minister said social infrastructure projects suffer from poor viability. Therefore, the government will enhance the quantum of viability gap funding up to 30 per cent each of the total project cost as VGF by central and state/statutory bodies. For other sectors, existing VGF support of 20 per cent each from the government of India and state/statutory bodies shall continue.For boosting private participation in space activities, the Centre will provide a level playing field for private companies in satellites, launches and space-based services.Also, the government will provide predictable policy and regulatory environment to private players, she said. The move ensures giving the private sector a role in India’s space programme, including in satellites, launches and space-based services.Future projects for India’s space programme and planetary exploration and outer space travel would be open for the private sector, the finance minister said, adding liberal geo-spatial data policy will provide remote-sensing data to tech-entrepreneurs in the country.This is the fourth phase of announcements by the Union Finance Ministry elaborating on the Centre’s Rs 20 lakh crore economic stimulus package.Over the last few days, Sitharaman has been convening daily media briefings to put forth Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision and share more details on the economic package meant to revive the industry grappling with a 54-day nationwide lockdown. The lockdown had been imposed towards the end of March to contain the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/structural-reforms-across-8-key-sectors-at-core-of-india-s-economic-revival-plan-fm/story-xBLHgR6eTEdzFbuDAuW8AN.html

ISRO has brought the country many laurels; however, today the private sector is also doing a lot of work in the space arena and a lot of individuals and start-ups have spent a lot of time developing space-related technology but unfortunately due to Indian regulations, they are unable to use ISRO’s available facilities for even testing their products,” said Sitharaman. In India, companies like Solar Industries India, Skyroot Aerospace, Godrej Space and L&T are already working with ISRO on rocket systems and other space-related technologies.Sitharaman said the government will provide predictable policy and regulatory environment to private players to encourage their participation.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19They will also be allowed to use ISRO facilities and other relevant assets to improve their capacities, she added.She made it clear that the extent of private participation also included future projects for planetary exploration, outer space travel etc.In addition to the above, she also promised a liberal geospatial data policy for providing remote sensing data to tech entrepreneurs.The reform is likely to help overcome the manpower and budgetary limitations holding back the development of the sector in India. The demand for the launch of satellites is growing and ISRO has indicated that it doesn’t have enough manpower to meet the growing demand and will look at private participation to augment the overall capacity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/private-firms-to-get-access-to-isro-s-facilities-space-exploration-opportunities/story-5vQriboni9O33WeiUsO8GI.html

The state governments failed to own their responsibility to help in such a critical situation,” BMS general secretary Vrijesh Upadhyay said in a statement.The BMS, which has also planned a nationwide protest on May 20 against the changes made to labour laws in several states, said workers have been left to their devices by their employers and contractors who they served for many years and contributed as wealth creators.“In many places neither the employer nor the contractors made efforts to take care of these workers who have been waiting patiently since March 25 onwards (when the lockdown was announced),” Upadhaya said.Referring to the accident in Aurangabad where 16 workers were run over by a train, the BMS functionary said it was “unwarranted interference” by the police authorities that forced workers to walk along tracks instead of taking the road.“Many more migrant workers lost their lives in road accidents while on their way home on foot,” he said, adding that the BMS state units will set up help desks at the district level to help workers travel and find jobs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/state-governments-failed-rss-backed-bharatiya-mazdoor-sangh-on-migrants-plight/story-y3DxOupCVWw1OYqgmQwvaN.html

Around 21 of us boarded the bus from Bengaluru. It met with an accident at around 4.30 am on Friday, and we found ourselves piled up on top of each other,” said a passenger, requesting anonymity. “Finally, one of the passengers managed to break the rear glass and we got out of the vehicle. Fortunately, all of us escaped with minor injuries except one girl, who suffered a gash on her forehead,” he added.Though the state government arranged a relief bus, it arrived after 10 hours at 2 pm on Friday.The relief bus arrived at the Karnataka-Goa border at around 8 pm on Friday, but the passengers had to wait, as per the protocol, till a police escort vehicle could take them to a Covid-19 testing facility and a quarantine centre. They arrived at their destination at around 5 am on Saturday.Over 6,200 stranded people from Goa have registered on the state government’s website, urging the authorities concerned to organise their return at the earliest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-bus-accident-21-injured-as-driver-loses-control-veers-off-the-road/story-A6vaJLZEvBae0Mm4ll46VJ.html

These assets and balance in the bank account being proceeds of crime have been provisionally attached under PMLA,” it added.The PMLA defines proceeds of crime as “any property derived or obtained, directly or indirectly, by any person as a result of criminal activity relating to a scheduled offence or the value of any such property”. As per law, foreigners are not allowed to buy properties in India and this violation attracts provisions of Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA). Ankit was arrested in the case by the ED in March and has been released on bail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/foreigners-cheated-in-goa-enforcement-directorate-attaches-56-flats-16-villas/story-O7cwwVdJxEeifisnw7B5EK.html

Their US counterparts are research units of two universities and the third is a biotechnology company.All three collaborations started in recent weeks as the coronavirus raged across the world, infecting millions of people and killing hundreds of thousands, a third of them in the United States, the pandemic’s epicenter.“I am proud to announce that the United States will donate ventilators to our friends in India. We stand with India and @narendrmodi during this pandemic,” the president wrote in the tweet, as he went on to acknowledge the vaccine projects, adding, “We’re also cooperating on vaccine development.”Indians appear to have been taken by surprise by the announcement specially as they had not sought it and he had not mentioned it in his response to a direct question about India at a news briefing shortly before. They have asked for more details about the numbers and the delivery schedule.Asked about the details of his offer including numbers, Trump hedged. “We’re sending a lot of ventilators to India. I spoke to Prime Minister Modi, and we’re sending quite a few ventilators to India. We have a tremendous supply of ventilators .”President Trump has often said the United States is the “king” of ventilators — a respiratory aid needed for severely ill hospitalized Covid-19 patients — as a result of an extraordinary push from his administration in response to early fears of an impeding shortage. He has since said the United States has more ventilators than its needs and it will be willing to share them with allies and partners.Indians are viewing Trump’s announcement on ventilators in the larger context of growing cooperation in the healthcare sector, even though it was in all probability just a thank-you gesture in return for the lifting of the ban on the export of selected drugs to allow a massive consignment of antimalarial hydroxychloroquine following Trump’s personal appeal to Prime Minister Narendra Modi last month.In a separate tweet hours later, the president’s National Security Council followed up with a full-bore acknowledgement of the vaccine projects. “The US and India are working together to fight #COVID19 and find a vaccine,” it said, adding, “the US-India Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership has never been stronger.” There was no mention of the ventilators.Pune-based Serum Institute of India and Codagenix, a biotech company headquartered in New York, were the first to announce their collaboration. “Codagenix and Serum Institute are pursuing an accelerated development pathway with built-in redundancies to increase speed and likelihood of success,” they said in an announcement on February 17.Codagenix, clinical-stage biotechnology company that develops prophylactic vaccines and oncolytic virus therapies brings tot he table the research and Serum Institute the scalability, the ability to quickly roll out millions and millions of doses that will be needed to be rolled out if the vaccine works.Bharat Biotech, a Hyderabad pharmaceutical company, is part of the second project which was announced on April 2, The American partners are virologists at the University of Wisconsin and FluGen, a biotech company whose flu vaccine form the platform for the Covid-19 vaccine research.Bharat Biotech is also the Indian collaborator in the third project, with researchers at the Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia, in April end.More than 100 research projects are under way world wide to develop a vaccine against a virus that has killed more 300,000 people worldwide, a third of them in the United States.President Trump has said a vaccine is possible before year-end and “even before”. And the man he has appointed to head the hunt in a joint public-private partnership comparable to the World War II-era Manhattan Project to develop the first nuclear weapons, has said this is a “credible” target.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/donald-trump-offers-india-ventilators-acknowledges-growing-collaboration-on-covid-19-vaccine/story-IenoGh0DeaBbJe0LY9sR6I.html

This pandemic is being fought collectively by all of us. In such times, it’s always important for nations to work together and do as much as possible to make our world healthier and free from COVID-19,” PM Modi tweeted.“More power to 🇮🇳 - 🇺🇸 friendship!” he added.Watch | ‘Spoke to PM Modi, sending a lot of ventilators to India’: US President Donald Trump Trump had announced the decision to send the ventilators on Twitter to underline close relations between the two countries. “I am proud to announce that the United States will donate ventilators to our friends in India. We stand with India and @narendrmodi during this pandemic,” the president wrote in the tweet, as he went on to acknowledge the vaccine projects.The United States will airlift 200 mobile ventilators to help Indians combat Covid-19, people familiar with the developments told HT. One ventilator will cost $13,000 (Rs 9.6 lakh at current exchange rates) approximately and India will have to pay $2.6 million (Rs 192 million) plus freight charges for all of them.Trump reiterated the point at his press conference later, referring to his India visit in February, the role played by Indian expatriates in the US and described PM Modi as a “good friend of mine”.“We are working closely with India,” he told reporters.Trump also said the US and India were cooperating to develop a vaccine for Covid-19 as more than 4.5 million people have contracted the disease and over 307,000 have died globally.The US move comes weeks after Prime Minister Modi acted on Trump’s request to reverse a ban on the export of hydroxychloroquine, a malaria drug that was championed by the US president as a “game-changer” in the fight against the coronavirus disease. Hydroxychloroquine, or HCQ, is being used in India as prophylaxis for health workers at the frontline of the country’s response to the epidemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/more-power-to-india-us-friendship-pm-tweets-after-trump-s-ventilators-offer/story-MimP6jN3NvWEgeKsAMuL6K.html

Expenditure Budget 2020-21 has already provided for BEE KEEPING under National Horticulture Mission and allocated Rs 2400 crore. FM may please clarify whether the sums she announced yesterday (Rs 500 crore and Rs. 13,343 crore) are subsumed in the Expenditure Budget numbers or additional sums of money,” tweeted Chidambaram.Announcing the details of the Rs 20 lakh crore package on Friday, Nirmala Sitharaman said the government will implement a Rs 500 crore scheme of infrastructure development for the country’s beekeepers, with special thrust on capacity building of women.“This will lead to an increase in income of 2 lakh bee-keepers,” Nirmala Sitharaman said.“Likewise, under Animal Disease Control Programme the fight against FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE has already been launched with a 5-year outlay of Rs 13,343 crore and allocation of Rs 1300 crore in 2020-21,” Chidambaram pointed out in another tweet.To improve animal husbandry incomes, which gives higher net returns compared to crops, Sitharaman had said: “We want to ensure 100% vaccination of nearly 530 million animals, a livestock size which is among the largest in the world. Despite Covid-19 lockdown, 15 million cows and buffaloes have been tagged and vaccinated.” To control foot and mouth diseases, which cripples milk output of afflicted animals, the FM announced Rs 13,343 crore.The government will set up an Animal Husbandry Infrastructure Development Fund worth Rs 15,000 crore to “support private investment in dairy processing, value addition and cattle feed infrastructure”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/p-chidambaram-s-the-new-r-d-tweet-swipe-at-fm-nirmala-sitharaman/story-82KeAVcVtFXQ09eoD6iJlM.html

At least 24 migrant workers were killed and 36 injured when a trailer rammed into a stationary truck, both carrying passengers, on a highway near Auraiya in Uttar Pradesh in the early hours of Saturday. “Extremely saddened to learn about the tragic road accident in Auraiya, Uttar Pradesh. Local administration is making all efforts to help those affected. Thoughts and prayers with the bereaved families and with those injured,” the president tweeted. According to police, some of the workers coming from Delhi had stopped for tea when the accident occurred between 3 am and 3.30 am on the Auraiya-Kanpur Dehat stretch of National Highway 19. The impact of the collision was so huge that both vehicles overturned and fell into a ditch.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/president-ram-nath-kovind-expresses-deep-sorrow-over-loss-of-lives-in-up-road-accident/story-SDjkFBQGLSNbwbD5qu9zkM.html
16-05-2020||India||Govt should not become a moneylender, says Rahul Gandhi||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said on Saturday the government should not become a “sahukar” or money lender in his first structured response to the Rs 20 lakh crore financial package offered by the Centre to reboot the economy battered by the coronavirus pandemic. He argued in favour of cash assistance instead of loans that are being announced and warned of an impending economic crisis, asking the government to consider rolling out Congress’ NYAY scheme temporarily in urban areas. Gandhi insisted that the government must come up with a “national strategy for income.”“When a child is hurt, the mother doesn’t offer a loan. As a citizen, my disappointment is the (Rs 20 lakh crore) package should not be of loans but for giving money in their hands. The government should not be a sahukar,” Gandhi said during an interaction with reporters of regional electronic media as finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman has been announcing the details of the schemes. Gandhi repeatedly pointed out to pet scheme NYAY—the cash-for-poor scheme that was pitched as the key plank in the 2019 election but didn’t find many takers.He clarified that the scheme should be implemented, albeit temporarily in urban areas while MGNREGS—a hallmark innovation of the UPA-era—must be strengthened in the rural areas.He, however, refused to indulge in a political blame game with the Modi government and said that his party will apply pressure “pyar se” on the government to accept their proposals.“I have heard the reason not to give money is to retain ratings. Our ratings are made by our farmers, our workers and businessmen. When people will start working, India’s ratings will improve,” he said as he warned the government of an economic storm which is impending.According to Gandhi, the most important thing now is to “fire demand and supply” and while infrastructure is certainly key, the government must give money in the hand of poor, echoing what many economists had been advocating.“If you want to start an engine you have put fuel in the carburettor. The fuel is cash. We must have a national strategy for income. We can’t sacrifice our economy as well as our elder generation,” Gandhi said suggesting that in the short time, small and medium business, farmers, migrant labourers and people in the high-risk category need to be protected.He refused to compare the current economic crisis with that of 1991 when the Congress government ushered in economic reforms. And while he narrated the steps taken by the Congress-ruled states to help the poor and migrant workers, he didn’t hesitate to draw the line of difference between the Congress and its coalition governments.When asked about the lack of services offered by Maharashtra for migrant workers, Gandhi said, “There is a difference between Congress and the alliance government. if you look at Congress states like Chhattisgarh, you will see a very aggressive strategy. But in an alliance, we try to put pressure through conversations.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-should-not-become-a-moneylender-says-rahul-gandhi/story-1BSdhrNq9cDAGpmfNL7t1N.html

The Tamil Nadu State Marketing Corporation (TASMAC) shops were, however, shut in Chennai and Tiruvallur.The move comes after the Supreme Court on Friday stayed the Madras High Court order regarding the ban on opening of shops, observing that a decision in that respect rests with the state government. In a May 1 order, the central government allowed states to sell liquor in standalone shops and said social distancing should be followed in such outlets.As part of measures to avoid crowding and ensure social distancing, authorities implemented a colour-coded token system that specified the date and time allotted for the buyers at a designated outlet, reported news agency PTI.To prevent unmanageable crowds witnessed in several places when the shops reopened on May 7 after a 43-day dry spell, the authorities limited the number of tokens per day to 500 and 70 for an hour.The shops are open from 10 am to 5 pm.Adequate police personnel were deployed to regulate crowds and tokens were distributed at separate locations away from the liquor shops and only those who had the coloured slips were allowed to buy beverages at the outlets.Several men could be seen standing with umbrellas in districts like Erode, Tirupur and at Madurantakam in Kancheepuram district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/liquor-shops-open-again-in-tamil-nadu-after-a-week-long-queues-seen/story-IgEGckGEf0IG2iREQ0sbUI.html

The fiscal deficit is projected to rise to 5.5% of GDP in FY21 versus the budgeted estimate of 3.5%.The Covid-19 spread in the country has also “significantly reduced the prospects of a durable fiscal consolidation,” it said in a report, according to Reuters.Last month, the Reserve Bank of India said that even after battered economically due to the Covid-19 crisis, India will continue to grow at 1.9 per cent during the current fiscal yearA week after the RBI’s prediction, the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) predicted that India’s gross domestic product (GDP) will like shrink by 0.9% in the current financial year in a worst-case scenario in the coronavirus crisis if restrictions on Covid-19 hotspots are extended, and may grow by as much as 1.5% in a best-case framework.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/an-economic-storm-is-coming-will-hurt-many-rahul-gandhi/story-siGf2i5Xvtn23a8mSr5MgJ.html
16-05-2020||India||As Pak army pushes for 20% hike in budget, India’s ‘I told you so moment’||At the April 16 meeting of the International Monetary Fund that cleared Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan’s request for $1.4 million aid to deal with the coronavirus crisis, the Indian representative on the board Surjit Bhalla had sounded a cautionary note.Bhalla had noted a propensity in Islamabad to divert development funds for security and asked the IMF to track what Pakistan does with the money. The IMF should, Bhalla suggested, monitor to ensure that the Pakistan government’s resources freed up as a result of the IMF assistance are only used for emergency response to the Covid-19 situation and “there’s no diversion of these resources to other sectors such as security”. Or to service its huge debt liabilities.ALSO WATCH | ‘They want riots...’: PoK activist on Pakistan bid to hold Gilgit Baltistan pollsIn the past, Bhalla said, there were reports to indicate that Pakistan had done both.Less than a month later, there is some indication that the Indian economist’s cautionary note wasn’t out of place.Pakistan’s Defence ministry last week pitched for a 20% raise in salaries of their personnel for the next financial year.A leaked Defence Ministry memorandum says the Joint Staff Headquarters in consultation with the service headquarters had proposed the hike because personnel were feeling the crunch due to a devalued rupee and inflation.Pakistan watchers in India say the pressure from the military - the army gets the largest share of the budget - was part of a long-establishment pattern.Last year, the Pakistan government raised the defence expenditure by a modest 4.5% over the previous year’s budget estimate to Pakistani Rs 1.15 trillion ($ 7.6 billion). That increase came a much-publicised statement by Army Chief Gen Qamar Bajwa that the armed forces would ‘forego’ the routine hike in the defence budget due to the financial crisis.Also Read: Pak’s troubled economy is hurting more than Imran Khan wants to believe | OpinionThe Imran Khan government had also played along. Hammad Azhar, the then minister of revenue, told parliament in his budget speech that the defence budget would remain unchanged at Rs 1.15 trillion. But a news agency PTI analysis later indicated this was inaccurate; the budget documents indicated a 4.5% hike over the previous year’s budget estimate and 1.3% over the revised estimates.The military’s push for a budget hike this year comes when Pakistan’s financial crisis, like economies elsewhere in the world, just got worse due to the Covid-19 outbreak.Pakistan watchers in India insist that a hike in the defence budget to keep the army commanders in good humour was an erroneous proposition, irrespective of how you look at it. For one, it reduces the meagre resources available with the government to restart the economy, strengthen health infrastructure and help the millions who are suffering the most due to Covid-19 and the lockdown that it induced. Pakistan has already reported close to 39,000 cases and over 800 deaths.It would not do any good to the military either. If the military is starved of funds for operational planning and capital investment, the offensive capability of the military will take a hit. That could further increase the reliance of the military on its strategic arm, the jihadis, both on the eastern and western borders, and run the risk of destabilising the Indian subcontinent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-pak-army-pushes-for-20-hike-in-budget-india-s-i-told-you-so-moment/story-M8R8lJZqfUFacczXqyxbVP.html

Gandhi’s comments came during his interaction with the members of the regional electronic media. He went on to take questions and suggestions from them. The Congress MP also reacted to Centre’s Rs 20 lakh crore stimulus package and said that he has a “reservation” against the economic plan. He urged the Centre to rethink the package so as to provide immediate money to the needy, the farmers and the migrant labourers. Gandhi also said that the nationwide coronavirus lockdown will need to be lifted in an intelligent manner and carefully to ensure that the vulnerable people are not affected. “We need to take care of the vulnerable people. The elderly people, those suffering from diabetes, hypertension, kidney diseases, et cetera. They must be taken care of,” he said. “Lockdown is not an ‘on-off’ switch, it should be lifted intelligently, carefully,” Gandhi said. Prior to today’s press conference and interaction with members of regional electronic media, Gandhi had led online interactive sessions with intellectuals like former Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan and Nobel laureate Abhijit Banerjee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/we-ll-suffer-greater-losses-than-those-cause-by-covid-19-if-demand-is-not-generated-rahul-gandhi-in-his-address/story-aZg4w8k88JLGSc8JeeYNCK.html

He went on to take questions and suggestions from representatives from regional electronic media. The Congress leader also reacted to the Centre’s economic stimulus package which was introduced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi earlier this week. He said that small and medium businesses, the farmers and the labourers are important for the economy to start, therefore the government must focus on ways to put money immediately in their pockets and “reconsider the stimulus package”. “I have a serious reservation about the nature of the package and I would like the government to reconsider it” Gandhi said on Saturday, adding that it is important to put money “directly into the hands of our people”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lockdown-needs-to-be-lifted-intelligently-carefully-rahul-gandhi/story-ubsixO70b4OCQl4P87cAaM.html
16-05-2020||India||‘Not a bad step but…’: Rahul Gandhi’s advice to Centre over economic package||Senior Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Saturday said the government must reconsider the Rs 20 lakh crore economic stimulus package and think about direct cash transfers to people suffering amid the lockdown to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).Rahul Gandhi said his message was not a political one and said that he was speaking on behalf of Indians. “I don’t want to make a political statement but I have a serious reservation about the nature of the package that the government has given. I would like the government to reconsider,” he said.ALSO WATCH | ‘Don’t bother about ratings, think about people’: Rahul Gandhi to Centre“It’s not a bad step but the most important thing right now is that we put money directly into the hands of our poor people,” he said.The former Congress president gave an analogy about how parents treat a child facing a crisis.“The mother or the father do not give him a bank loan, they do not give him credit. A mother is ready to give whatever food she has to her daughter or son and the government should follow that spirit,” he said.“When a mother gives money to her son there are two reasons. The biggest reason is love as parents love their children and the second that they are their future as well. The people who are suffering, walking on an empty stomach are India’s future. We have to support them,” he said.The Congress leader said migrants workers, the farmers, small businesses and other such people don’t need loans but money. “With all respect, I would like to ask the Prime Minister to think about putting money directly into people’s bank accounts. He should consider direct bank transfer, MGNREGA for 200 days and money to farmers directly because these people are our future,” the Congress leader said.“These are the people who have built India. We must support them,” he said.The government must stop thinking about ratings and start considering people who need money in their pockets to deal with the crisis of the coronavirus pandemic, Rahul Gandhi said.“I have heard that the reason behind not giving money to such people is ratings. It is being said that if we increase our deficit today, the foreign agencies will downgrade our ratings,” he said.“Our rating is made by India, farmers, labourers, small and big businesses who need our support and money. Don’t think about ratings and foreign countries. Now, it is the time think about India not others,” the Congress leader said.Also read: ‘Lockdown not an ‘on-off’ switch; must be lifted intelligently, carefully’: Rahul GandhiOnce they start working, India’s ratings will improve, he said.Before this, the former Congress president has held online interactive sessions with former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan and Nobel laureate Abhijit Banerjee.The dialogue with Rajan was first in the series that Gandhi plans to hold with public intellectuals.

16-05-2020||India||‘Country staring at economic storm, need to lift lockdown wisely’: Highlights of Rahul Gandhi’s media interaction||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Saturday interacted with the media during which he spoke about the situation of the migrants and the economic package announced by the Centre to help those affected by the Covid-19 outbreak and revive the economy.  “I will be taking questions from the electronic regional news media at 12 noon today. You can watch the press conference LIVE right here on Twitter or on my YouTube channel,” Gandhi had posted on Twitter on Saturday morning.Speaking with members of the press, the Wayanad MP asked the Modi government to rethink its Rs 20 lakh crore economic package. He said the Centre should put the money directly in the hands of the people by transferring it to their bank accounts instead of offering it as credit. The former Congress chief had addressed a video press conference earlier this month on May 8 and took questions on Covid-19 and the economic crisis.Here are the highlights of the his press interaction:- Rahul Gandhi thanks media for the role it has played in highlighting the issues related to Covid-19 outbreak.- On PM’s ‘local about vocal’ slogan, Rahul Gandhi said that a person can be vocal only if they aren’t hungry, again reiterating the demand to put money in the bank accounts of those affected. - Centre is not giving the money to the states that is due to them...all CMs saying this, even the BJP chief ministers- The Railways minister’s allegation of Congress-ruled states not giving NOCs to let trains go to their states, Rahul Gandhi says it is a wrong allegation since it was Congress which made the suggestion in the first place. He again reiterates that migrants should be sent back to their states safely and their needs taken care of.- The government’s economic package is a credit package under which the money is not reaching those affected directly. Which is what we are saying today. -States should get support from the Centre because only the states can lead and implement the fight against Covid-19 while the role of the central government is to manage. There are complaints that the Centre is not giving states their share of money. - States where we are in alliance, there is a conversation. But we are certainly putting pressure on these governments and aggressively pursuing this in Congress-ruled states to help migrant workers walking backing home.- Asked about how to strengthen MNREGA, Rahul Gandhi said - those in villages should be covered under MNREGA and in cities, should be covered under NYAY. We are asking government to implement a programme like NYAY scheme for those working in cities, give them money for a few months and then stop it after that. - I am sure the government will consider my suggestions. I have spoken to a lot of people who have said the same things about putting money in people’s hands. I want PM Modi to seriously think about these suggestions. - There is no choice between livelihood and people’s health. We need to lift lockdown....we have to revive our economy and take care of those at risk . That is what the planning all about. - In the short term, fire demand, protect small and medium businesses. In the medium term, these businesses should be given financial support. There should be a clear-cut policy for job creation.- I want to warn the government that the country is staring at economic storm and I am trying to put pressure on them. That is the work of the opposition- It is the duty of the government, Opposition and all of us to help the migrants and put money directly into their pockets. - Asked about who is responsible for the ‘condition of migrants’, Rahul Gandhi said, this isn’t the time to point fingers. He said the problem of migrants is very challenging.; all of us need to help those walking on the highways. --We have to open the lockdown but it should be lifted carefully and intelligently, protecting the vulnerable people like aged, heart patients etc at the same time.- The government should rethink its economic package. There is need to put money in the hands of the people, directly in their bank accounts because if we do not support our small businesses and farmers and others, our economy won’t start. - India is in a crisis , small business, labourers and every one is in a crisis; heartbreaking to see migrants walking on highways.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-addresses-media-on-covid-19-situation-highlights/story-tHZfriS6ExMwGevQmZQd8N.html

Covid-19 related death toll went up to 1,068 after 49 fresh fatalities were recorded.The state government is in favour of further extension of lockdown restrictions, which expire on Sunday, till end-May, and this time around the curbs are likely to be eased even in red zones a bid to open up economic activities.State health Rajesh Tope said that a decision to allow economic activities in red zones would be taken after Monday.Though the state’s Covid-19 related mortality rate has dropped to 3.7%, it is still above the national average rate of 3.23%. At present, the state’s doubling rate – the number of days taken for cases to increase two-fold -- is a little over 10 days.Mumbai, which accounts for around 60% of all Covid-19 positive cases in the state, reported 933 new cases on Friday, as the total count rose to 17,671. The city also recorded 34 fresh deaths and 655 people have died in the country’s financial hub so far.Tope has requested Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to reserve 60% of beds in private hospitals for Covid-19 patients while anticipating a peak by end-June. The contingency plans are being put in place in line with the recommendations of the Dr. Sanjay Oak-led task force that the state government has formed to identify ways to reduce the mortality rate. The rest 40% of beds in these private hospitals would be reserved for non-Covid-19 patients, the minister said.Maharashtra’s positivity percentage is at 11.61% after 2,50,436 tests were conducted till Friday, of which 2,21,336 proved negative. Of the 10,291 tests conducted in the 24 hours between Thursday and Friday evening, 1,576 tested positive, or a positivity percentage of 15.31%.The state authorities have put 3,29,302 and 16,306 under home and institutional quarantine, respectively.

The HC has however said that the acceptance of suggestions would depend on whether they are realistic and within medical protocols. The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice AA Sayed on Friday was apprised by three petitioners namely Mehrwan Farshed, Dayanand Stalin and Mutahhar Khan, about the absence of requisite medical facilities being made available for non-Covid-19 patients.The petitioners through their respective public interest litigations (PILs) had pointed out that many non-Covid-19 patients had been unnecessarily suffering and even death without proper treatment. The petitioners further alleged that Covid-19 and non-coronavirus affected patients had been refused treatment in government as well as private hospitals leading to the death of a number of patients. Also read: India’s Covid-19 tally nears 86,000-mark; death toll at 2,752One of the petitioners also pointed out that families of elderly coronavirus-affected patients had been forced to wait day and night for hours just for routine medical examination.The petitioners had prayed that in light of these submissions, the HC should initiate necessary action against hospitals and institutions that refuse treatment to patients suffering from other ailments. The petitioners also sought directions for the provision of adequate ambulances to ferry Covid-19 and non-coronavirus patients and to convert state-run and private buses into ambulances if there was a shortage.Senior counsel Anil Sakhare appearing for the BMC vehemently opposed the petitioners’ allegations. He submitted that sufficient arrangements were in place to look after the needs of non-Covid-19 patients.After hearing the submissions through video conferencing, the bench observed, “Having regard to the havoc wreaked by Covid-19 and in the absence of any therapeutic cure of the disease, every possible option ought to be explored so that the suffering of the people at large can be minimised to the extent possible.” With regards to the suggestions of the petitioners and private institutions the bench said, “If indeed what the petitioners and the private institutions suggest are of any help or assistance to mankind, we see no reason as to why the State and the Corporation may not consider the same in its true perspective.”The bench then directed the petitioners and private institutions to compile a set of all their suggestions by Sunday and to forward it to the state and corporation for consideration upon due application of mind. “We make it clear that the suggestions shall be realistic so that they can be implemented and it shall also be ensured that the same are consistent with the extant medical protocol,” the court observed and directed the authorities to file a report indicating steps proposed to be taken based on suggestions and posted the hearing of the PILs on May 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/consider-suggestions-from-private-institutions-on-medical-facilities-for-non-covid-19-patients-bombay-hc-to-state-bmc/story-IihWh6m0Qfjtra0c4Muh5N.html

With this, the state’s tally has gone up to 576 including four deaths.The CM said that the sudden increase in Covid cases in the state is a real concern and the government will take all steps to maintain a steady rate.Kerala, which reported the country’s first coronavirus case, declared last week that it had flattened the curve. But from only 20 active cases on May 10, the numbers rose to 80 on May 15, an increase of 60 positive cases in just five days, according to PTI.The spurt in the infections was seen after the return of expats from abroad and migrant workers from other parts of the country.Of the cases reported on Friday, seven are those who have returned from abroad, while four had come from Tamil Nadu and two from Mumbai, said Vijayan.Out of the total cases in the state, north Kerala district Wayanad, which was earlier a green zone, has reported maximum cases of 19 followed by Kasaragod, the chief minister said.The CM said a non-AC special train will be arranged from New Delhi next week to bring stranded students. A special help desk will be set up for this in Delhi. Similarly the railways agreed to run a daily train from Bangaluru to Thiruvananthapuram and special trains from five other states.Opposition parties had slammed the government for its delay in bringing back stranded alleging that it was more concerned on its graph than welfare of its people.The state had observed a complete shutdown on May 10 as well as a symbolic gesture to renew its fight against the pandemic. May 17 is the last day of the third phase of nationwide lockdown to curb the spread of Covid-19. The dates of the fourth phase of lockdown are yet to be announced.

It’s unfortunate that CM’s directions are not being taken seriously by officers because of which a big accident occurred in Auraiya,” the BSP chief was quoted as saying by ANI.“I demand the chief minister to take action against the officers who didn’t fulfil their responsibilities. Families of those who were killed or injured in this accident should be provided financial assistance.

My condolences to the bereaved families of the dead,” Adityanath tweeted.“Instructions have also been given to provide all possible relief to the victims, to provide proper treatment to the injured and to promptly investigate the accident,” he added. जनपद औरैया में सड़क दुर्घटना में प्रवासी कामगारों/श्रमिकों की मृत्यु दुर्भाग्यपूर्ण एवं दुःखद है, मेरी संवेदनाएं मृतकों के शोक संतप्त परिजनों के साथ हैं। पीड़ितों को हर संभव राहत प्रदान करने,घायलों का समुचित उपचार कराने व दुर्घटना की त्वरित जांच करवाने के निर्देश भी दिए गए हैं।Adityanath had on Friday asked state officials to set up teams in every police station area to ensure that no migrant worker travels on foot or bike or in any unsafe mode in Uttar Pradesh.The directive came amid rising cases of migrants losing their lives in road accidents while walking back home.The CM said food and water should be provided to the migrants as soon as they enter the state and added that they should be medically screened. Arrangements for a vehicle to send them to their respective destinations should be made if they are found fit, Adityanath told officials.He said the state government was sensitive towards the problems of migrant labourers and all efforts must be made to ensure that workers reach their destination. He said no laxity in this regard would be tolerated.He said director generals of police (DGPs) of all states should be contacted and a request made to them to ensure that no migrant labourer travels by trucks or any other unsafe vehicle, failing which strict action would be taken against those ferrying them in unsafe vehicles.The chief minister said buses should be arranged to carry those reaching the state by train from different states to carry them home. In case state-run buses are not available, private vehicles should be deployed for the migrant labourers, he said. He said drivers of the buses should also be given protective equipment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-cm-adityanath-orders-probe-into-road-accident-in-auraiya-that-killed-24-migrant-workers/story-fG2UV3GVMgV6mp96utWUBN.html
16-05-2020||India||Left, Cong-backed unions to strike over labour law freeze||New Delhi: Trade unions allied to the Congress and Left parties and other non-affiliated organisations have called a nationwide hunger strike on May 22 to protest the suspension of labour laws by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) governments in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat.Trade unions such as the Indian National Trade Union Congress (INTUC), a frontal organisation of the Congress, the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU), which is affiliated to the Communist Party of India-Marxist(CPI-M), the Self Employed Women’s Association (SEWA) and the All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC) have joined hands against the move by these state governments.INTUC president G Sanjeeva Reddy said representatives of different trade unions met on Thursday through video conference and decided to go for a day-long hunger strike on May 22 to protest against the “draconian move” by BJP-ruled states.In a statement, CITU general secretary Tapan Sen last week called on trade unions, irrespective of their affiliation, to unite and resist this “barbarous and brutal machination on the rights and livelihood” of workers.The Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS), a trade union affiliated to the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS), too has called a nationwide protest on May 20 against the decision by the BJP governments. The RSS is the ideological mentor of the BJP.Asked if they would take along BMS since it was also opposed to the move, Reddy said this matter wasn’t discussed at Thursday’s meeting.“We have not approached the BMS. We have seen in the past how they were first keen to join us and later backtracked,” he said.The BMS has criticised the governments of Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat for doing away with labour laws, and also Rajasthan, Goa and Odisha for increasing working hours.The RSS affiliate described these changes as “unheard of in history” and “rare even in most undemocratic countries”.Why then are the unions not burying their differences to come together? BMS president Saji Narayanan said left-affiliated trade unions seldom overlook political considerations in taking up issues.He said while trade unions were vocal in criticising the Centre for the decision to withhold additional DA, they chose not to protest when the Kerala government used an ordinance to cut salaries.In April, the Pinarayi Vijayan government issued an ordinance to cut a month’s salary in five installments for all state-owned enterprises, public sector undertakings (PSUs), quasi-government organisations and universities, among others.Narayanan said there have been instances in the past when the unions came together but the arrangements did not last.A BMS functionary said trade unions, irrespective of their political affiliation, came together in the 1990s as the national campaign committee, but later broke up since differences emerged on the Ramjanamabhoomi issue.In December 2013, INTUC joined hands with Left-allied unions and called for a Bharat Bandh after the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government announced its decision to wind up eight PSUs.Eleven central trade unions came together against the proposed changes to labour laws by the then UPA government.A fresh attempt to bring the unions together was made in 2018, when BMS and a faction of INTUC formed a non-political group, the Confederation of Central Trade Unions or CONCENT, to bring together unions on common issues related to labour protection.Communist Party of India (CPI) general secretary D Raja said though BMS had been part of some common platforms that were launched to bring together central trade unions, it began to withdraw from protests after the BJP came to power in 2014.“Dilution of labour laws cannot be justified by the government and they cannot be accepted. Labour laws were not given on a platter, they are hard-won,” he said.The issue has triggered a fresh slugfest between the BJP and the opposition, with former Congress president Rahul Gandhi saying on Monday the fight against the Coronavirus cannot be an excuse to exploit workers, suppress their voice and crush their human rights.The remarks came in the wake of states such as Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh amending labour laws.Gandhi also said there cannot be any compromise on basic principles by allowing unsafe workplaces.“Many states are amending labour laws. We are together fighting against corona, but this cannot be an excuse to crush human rights, allow unsafe workplaces, exploit workers and suppress their voice. There cannot be any compromise on these basic principles,” he tweeted.However, the BJP insisted that labour law reforms are a long-standing demand of unions and industries. “As it is in the concurrent list, the Centre had earlier consolidated 40 existing laws into four codes to streamline compliance and help formalisation of the labour force. Now, some state governments are working for further streamlining the functioning of industry and helping restart the economic cycle. These amendments are for the benefit of the economy as a whole, including workers,” BJP spokesperson Gopal Agarwal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/left-cong-backed-unions-to-strike-over-labour-law-freeze/story-ros62jE3UvZJ6LTHszds9H.html
16-05-2020||India||India to privatise discoms in all Union Territories, explore PPP across states||India will privatize electricity distribution companies (discoms) in all its eight union territories, and explore public-private partnerships for power distribution in some states, Union power minister Raj Kumar Singh said.The Centre has informed the Union territories about the decision, Singh said at a digital interaction with power sector chief executives. Unlike discoms in states governed by the respective state governments, those in Union territories are directly administered by the central government.“So as far as the Union territories are concerned, we have decided that we will put in place a distribution system which is based on totally open, transparent, competitive, commercial principles. So, you people are welcome to compete,” Singh said at an event organised by lobby group Confederation of Indian Industry (CII). The move comes in the backdrop of the government on Wednesday announcing a reform-linked ~90,000 crore bailout package for fund-starved discoms, along with concessional tariffs.“We will be bidding them out for distribution companies to take up. And all the Union territories have been told that we will have distribution companies that are from the private sector,” Singh added.India’s electricity distribution reforms scheme — tentatively named Atal Distribution System Improvement Yojana (Aditya)— aims to cut electricity losses below 12%. India’s average aggregate technical and commercial loss are currently at 21.4%. The scheme aims to ensure continuous supply of power, by privatizing state-run discoms and negating tariff gaps. Prepaid smart meters will be made mandatory across the power distribution chain, including 250 million households.Singh said the Union government will approach some other states for a public-private partnership (PPP) mode on the lines of Delhi or Odisha to bid out their distribution companies.Odisha was the first state to privatize its power distribution sector into four discoms in 1999. This was followed by Delhi, which privatised three of its discoms in July 2002: BSES Rajdhani Power Ltd (BRPL), BSES Yamuna Power Ltd (BYPL) and Tata Power Delhi Distribution Ltd. There is a growing interest in power discoms. Mint reported on 12 May about at least eight investors showing initial interest in buying Reliance Infrastructure Ltd’s Delhi power distribution businesses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-to-privatise-discoms-in-all-union-territories-explore-ppp-across-states/story-pV1hTcCKF4l4qVfJUpGZfO.html

The findings were revealed in a survey conducted by the Center for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) in 27 states. Researchers have found that livelihood in rural areas of the country has had the worst effect, although the spread of coronavirus in these areas is quite low. The survey, which was conducted in April, included around 5800 families across the country. The data from the survey was analyzed by Marianne Bertrand, professor of economics at the University of Chicago and CMIE chief economist Kaushik Krishnan. The survey showed that the worst impact of the lockdown has been borne by five states, including Tripura in the North-east and the north Indian states of Chhattisgarh, Bihar, Jharkhand and Haryana.Also read: In long walk back home, migrants battle hunger, scourge of Covid-1934% of the families that were surveyed said that they would not be able to live even a week without additional financial help. The survey has seen a decrease in the income of high-paid people, most of them have permanent jobs and are also able to work from home during the lockdown. In the low-income group, only those associated with agricultural work and catering workers are able to get any work amid the lockdown.According to data from the CMIE and other institutions, about 10 crore Indians lost their jobs in a month after the lockdown was announced on March 25 in the country. Talking around the world, the income of 1.3 billion people has been affected extensively due to the ongoing lockdown in different countries.The number of coronavirus cases have breached the 81,000 mark.

16-05-2020||India||Lockdown 4.0: What states are saying about relaxations||Several state governments want complete shutdowns only in containment zones allowing space for the resumption of almost all activities, except large social gatherings and educational institutions, during lockdown 4.0.Officials in several states said the guidelines defining containment zones, a key guidance document for enforcing lockdown 4.0, would come by Saturday and it was likely to divide a district into red, orange and green zones, unlike the existing methodology of categorising an entire district as red, orange or green.Click here for full Covid-19 coveragePrime Minister Narendra Modi, in his address to the nation on Monday, had said that the lockdown 4.0 will have a “completely different form”, with new rules.The current period of lockdown—the third since it was enforced on March 25—is scheduled to end on Sunday. Here’s what is likely to happen during lockdown 4.0:* It appears from the viewpoint expressed by government officials that states are likely to allow resumption of all industrial activities, offices and standalone markets from May 18 onwards. * Public transport including autos and taxis would resume with certain restrictions on number of passengers along with intra-district travel, except for the containment zones. Interstate travel may also be opened up but only for those with travel passes.* Permission is also likely to be given for all types of home delivery of goods, officials said.* Educational institutions will continue to remain closed with several states expected to declare summer holidays from May end or June.* Religious and political meetings are unlikely to be allowed for some more time apart from other activities that require or encourage mass gatherings or community participation including shopping in malls and other public places.* Marriages and funerals would be allowed with limited attendees, officials said.What states want:* Maharashtra, which has the maximum number of Covid cases, submitted its position to the Centre on extending the lockdown. The state is in favour of extension with more relaxations in less affected zones, so as to ensure economic activities resume gradually.State health minister Rajesh Tope said that the decision about red zones will be taken by May 18, but the state government is considering easing the lockdown in non-affected areas in red-zone districts too. Largely affected cities like Mumbai, Thane, Navi Mumbai, Pune, Nashik may also see relaxations in commercial operations.* Delhi’s chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has said markets, malls, public transport, including the Delhi Metro, and all offices should be allowed to open with reduced footfall and staggered operations.* Gujarat, which has the third highest number of Covid-19 cases, wants to resume all economic activity in all major urban centres except Ahmedabad, which accounts for state’s 70% cases.* Some states may have state specific relaxations, for example, the Karnataka government is in the favour of resuming inter-state travel with mandatory 14-day quarantine for travellers.* Even Rajasthan government favours inter-state travel. Kerala, however, wants inter-state travel only on the basis of a pass while Bihar and Jharkhand are opposed to inter-state travel of individuals and have requested the Centre for a guidance document.* Telangana, which has extended lockdown till May 29, is likely to announce more relaxations in sectors such as information technology and real estate.* Kerala wants resumption of metro services, local trains, domestic flights, restaurants and hotels to revive the tourism sector.* Karnataka may open restaurants, hotels and gymnasiums. Andhra Pradesh has proposed resumption of all activities except in containment areas. Both Himachal and Uttarakhand would allow hotels and resorts to open with limited capacity.* Tamil Nadu, another industrial state, plans to open all places except containment areas.* Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh has asked for an extension of the lockdown, stating during the meeting with PM Modi that “we must have strong lockdown. I will ensure a curfew”.* Bihar, Jharkhand and Odisha want to continue with stricter lockdown as their Covid-19 cases are increasing due to the return of migrant workers. Jharkhand’s rural development minister Alamgir Alam said the state will allow all standalone shops and will provide work to migrant workers, who have returned home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lockdown-4-0-what-states-are-saying-about-relaxations/story-GVHykIiSwBaQVIFBjRyrkO.html

We’re also following all the guidelines,” an employee of the Hotel Imphal by Classic said.The employee also appreciated the move of the government for initiating the business. A staff of Hotel Tampha (Old) also shared a similar sentiment.After the imposition of the nationwide lockdown and curfew in Manipur since March end, almost all hotels and restaurants in Imphal have closed down their services.After the first and second Covid-19 patients recovered and discharged from hospitals last month, the third case was reported on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/manipur-govt-notifies-hotels-hostel-as-paid-quarantine-centres/story-7S1qiQ2llIgsbfRHjmZSMI.html

These employees for various reasons, such as non approval in case of added institutions and disciplinary cases, cannot get the new pay scale.The hike is applicable for state government employees and those of aided educational institutions drawing pay under ORSP Rules, 2008.Teaching and non-teaching staff of state universities, medical college teachers, subordinate judicial officers, work-charged employees drawing regular scale of pay and job contract workers will also be eligible for payment of increased DA.The increased DA will be paid in cash and can be drawn in the pay bill of May 2020 and onwards. The payment of DA arrears from July 2019 to April 2020 will be drawn and disbursed after payment of salary of May 2020.Last month, the Odisha government had announced deferment of 50% in gross salary in respect of all India service officers—the Indian Administrative Service, Indian Police Service and Indian Forest Service.Similarly, it also announced deferment of 70% in the gross salary in respect of the chief minister, ministers, MLAs, chairperson of all corporations and elected representatives of all urban local bodies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/despite-covid-19-pandemic-affecting-revenue-odisha-announces-raise-in/story-fiuNpgaJxR92OBhRNoeSTJ.html
16-05-2020||India||Packed in Myanmar’s decision to deport 22 insurgents, a sharp message to others||The 22 northeastern insurgents from six outfits flown out of Myanmar in a special flight on Friday have landed in India and have been handed over to the police in Manipur and Assam.Myanmar’s decision marks a huge step forward for security cooperation between the two neighbours that New Delhi believes sets the template for other anti-India insurgents caught by Naypyidaw.But it has taken months of hard work and perseverance. Nine months, to be precise, people familiar with the developments told Hindustan Times.The first step was taken during the India visit of Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, the Commander-in-Chief of Myanmar Defence Services. One of the many meetings that Senior General Hlaing had in Delhi with the Indian leadership was with National Security Adviser Ajit Doval. It was at this July-end meeting that Ajit Doval broached the topic.The 22 insurgents had been captured by Myanmar military during joint operations carried out a few months earlier along the borders of Myanmar’s Sagaing Region. The operations, codenamed “Operation Sunshine”, had started in February and continued through March.INSURGENTS DEPORTED FROM MYANMARNDFB (S)Rajen Daimary @ Rebgon, self-styled Home SecySelf-styled Capt Sansuma Basumatary @ SarontsaiGagaram Basumatary @ Capt.

The tactic, called “hammer and anvil”, involves one force pinning down the enemy while the other corners and slams them. The insurgents had been extorting money from Indian personnel working on the $ 484 million Kaladan multi-modal transit transport project in Myanmar funded by India.The second phase focused largely on anti-India insurgents; the Myanmar army action forced the insurgents to cross over and surrender to Indian border guards. It is during the second phase of the operation that the 22 insurgents deported on Friday were caught by Myanmar military.Senior security officials who have been closely associated with the exercise to get back the insurgents said NSA Ajit Doval and Home Minister Amit Shah oversaw the efforts that continued ever since the July meeting.The decision to deport these 22 insurgents, an official said, is a sharp contrast to the time when Myanmar would rarely act against the anti-India insurgents for one reason or the other. As a result of cooperation between security agencies of the two countries, Myanmar initially took some action and later conducted joint operations with Indian security forces.Also Read: Nudged by Ajit Doval, Myanmar army hands over 22 northeast insurgentsThis moved up a notch when Myanmar okayed joint operations Indian soldiers would move into its territory to back it up as happened during the 2019 operations. Indian soldiers had also provided military provisions and tactical support in the form of UAV and satellite imagery to the Myanmar units on the ground.Handing over insurgents is a huge leap, the official said, adding that this places security cooperation between India and Myanmar at a similar plane as the UAE which, due to synergy between security agencies of the two countries, isn’t a haven for criminals wanted in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/packed-in-myanmar-s-decision-to-deport-22-insurgents-a-sharp-message-to-others/story-e1Nen0xQkwhoBAUJjSlU3I.html
16-05-2020||India||The office is dead; long live the office||Work from home (WFH) is the new mantra — partly because it is safe and convenient, the most important things right now; and partly because it could mean lower real estate costs for companies struggling to cope with what the pandemic and the lockdown have done to their business. Not every job can be done from home, but even in jobs that can be, not everyone has the luxury of working from home. Yes, luxury. WFH assumes that people have the connectivity they need to work from home; that their homes have quiet (or not-so-quiet) corners from where they can work; and that they do not mind work becoming all consuming. Because it will. Many people are under the misapprehension that working from home will improve their work-life balance. It may, but largely in jobs that involve either making or listening to presentations (oh yes, there are many such). In other jobs, particularly operational roles that involve getting one’s hands dirty (figuratively; coding is an example), the balance will tilt strongly towards work. The term always-on acquires a new meaning in the context of working from home. Sure, as pointed out by reams of literature produced over the past few decades on how to work from home, the not-so-secret secret is switching off — except that companies may not want that.I’ve worked from home off and on over the past month, including one two-week period when I did not step out of home (not a quarantine; more a constraint necessitated by something else). I have the luxury of a study in a nice sunlit corner, good connectivity, a very quiet neighbourhood (April was mild, so I left the garden door open), and excellent company (as you can see from the photograph), but I hated it. For starters, I missed my commute. I’m probably in a minority here; I can’t think of someone in Mumbai or Bengaluru saying this (my commute involves being driven through the most beautiful part of Delhi); but the commute in gives me an opportunity to process the information I’ve assimilated since morning, catch up with my e-mail, and plan the day ahead. At home, my commute involved entering the study. I also missed my commute back. I usually leave office around 10pm, and spend the 20 minutes or so it takes to be driven back home catching up with news I might have missed in the course of the day. It’s the period of the day when the Page 1 team gets a barrage of messages from me, all links with the same question – “Do we have this?”Not having an average departure time also meant that I didn’t know when to switch off. My work day, which would usually end around 10pm, with messages being exchanged till 11.00, sometimes 11.30, stretched on and on. But maybe this was just me. I also missed the social interaction at the workplace — that accidental meeting and resulting conversation that results in a series; an all-hands bureau meeting; the Page 1 meeting at the hub table. Social media has trained us to build relationships with those we rarely encounter in the real world; better collaborative tools are enabling us work together without ever having to be in the same room (even country); but there is still something missing. For decades now, companies have spent money and effort on having the right kind of offices. They believed (note the past tense) that these encouraged preferred work processes and interactions, and contributed to building an organisational culture. From Google to Godrej, Infosys to ITC, and Hindustan Unilever to HT Media, they invested in offices and campuses. Now, health and economic reasons are making them swear by working from home. The question they will all have to answer is whether it is possible to build and maintain a culture minus the office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-office-is-dead-long-live-the-office/story-2dxD6LLHuZ4cHZ1yftDjNN.html

16-05-2020||India||IAS officer from Madhya Pradesh blames Maharashtra govt for chaos at inter-state border||A senior IAS officer from Madhya Pradesh on Friday blamed the Maharashtra government for a chaotic situation and crisis at the MP border, a charge refuted by Maharashtra government officials.Bijasan on the MP-Maharashtra border in Barwani district, 313 kilometres south west of Bhopal, has seen a good number of labourers from Maharashtra heading to various parts of MP, UP, Bihar, Jharkhand, Rajasthan etc being dropped at the border by Maharashtra government’s state transport buses since Monday, officials said.This has led to a surge in the crowd of labourers and their family members coming in trucks, mini trucks, cars, taxis, auto-rickshaws, bikes etc and even walking and riding bicycles since lockdown restrictions were put in place from March 23, to cover hundreds of kilometres, according to officials.While the MP government arranged to send MP labourers to their destinations in buses from the border for quite some time, it added 100 more buses to the fleet to drop other states’ labourers at the UP border since Tuesday albeit with change of buses twice en route. But the number of buses provided by the MP government so far has been hardly able to accommodate the labourers with their number swelling leading to frayed tempers on the border on Thursday and stone pelting by a section of labourers on government personnel. However, none were injured, officials said.Responding to journalists’ questions on his visit to Bijasan on Friday, Commissioner of Indore division Akash Tripathi said, “It’s not our responsibility. Maharashtra should not do this. Also, they are dropping ‘wrong people at wrong places. People from eastern MP districts like Rewa, Satna etc are also being dropped here. Even eastern UP’s people are being dropped here on the western side. They should be dropped at a further point or they should be sent by trains. What is happening is wrong. But our chief minister has taken this stand on a humanitarian ground that since they are walking long distances we should use our buses to send them up to the UP border.”He said, “We have now increased the number of buses from 100 to 200 given the crowd of other states’ people and made available buses in the morning to avoid any chaotic situation. We are making all out efforts to see to it that the migrant labourers from other states don’t have to walk in such scorching heat but we have our own limitations of resources. If they have to send labourers to borders they should limit the number.”In reply to a question on social distancing norms thrown into disarray, the senior IAS officer said, “We are trying our best to see that they travel on seats in buses and are wearing masks but crowd management is a big issue here. In such a situation complete compliance of the norm is difficult. Besides, we see a huge crowd in trucks coming from Maharashtra and hardly any social distancing norms followed.”As per officials, after lockdown 2.0, the number of such labourers has gone up from 20,000 to 25,000 per day from a few thousands in the beginning.For the past about 12 days the district administration has allowed the other states’ labourers to enter the state without facing any hassles unlike earlier when the border was opened after intervals and it witnessed frequent confrontations between two sides. Three cops were injured in a stone pelting incident on May 3. Till the bus service was started for other states’ labourers by MP government since Tuesday those walking or riding bicycles used to be accommodated in trucks and other vehicles at the insistence of police personnel but a large number of workers continued to walk after finding no space in trucks and other vehicles, said officials.Nimad region in Madhya Pradesh comprising of Khandwa, Khargone, Burhanpur and Barwani districts witnesses higher temperatures than other parts of the state in summers. The nearest district in UP is Lalitpur district from Bijasan, about 600 kilometres away, while Jhansi which labourers mainly prefer to go to is about 650 kilometres away.Nitin Kareer, additional chief secretary, revenue department, Maharashtra government who is in charge of the operation related to workers said, “We are not leaving anyone on the border. We are ready to send them by train and also sending some of them by buses, only in the cases where we get permission from the Madhya Pradesh government. Some cases may have happened, I’m not denying that but otherwise we are in touch and have not heard anything like this from them (Madhya Pradesh government).(With inputs from HT Maharashtra bureau).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ias-officer-from-madhya-pradesh-blames-maharashtra-govt-for-chaos-at-inter-state-border/story-bMSZ48j1BVKorPBsjFkCTM.html
16-05-2020||India||In long walk back home, migrants battle hunger, scourge of Covid-19||On Wednesday, Ram Prakash Gautam, a migrant worker from Mumbai, has just reached Varanasi and he says he feels blessed.“I feel safe here,” he says, as he alights from a container truck carrying 49 workers from Mumbai, which was stopped by the police. “We found 49 people inside the container truck instead of goods mentioned in the documents,” says traffic circle office Awadhesh Pandey.The workers started their journey on May 9 after hiring a truck for Rs 1,50,000 lakh. “We were left with no choice ,” Gautam said, claiming that they got out of the container only twice during the four day journey. “We survived on biscuits and water.” Also Read: States look to ease curbs, restart interstate travel in lockdown 4.0A reverse migration, forced upon people by the loss of their livelihoods -- itself the result of the lockdown enforced to fight the spread of the coronavirus disease -- is playing out across India. Tens of thousands of workers are finally making their way back home. Some, the lucky ones, are on special trains organised by the government; others are on buses organised by the states; still others have hired trucks or stowed away on them; and there are those who are cycling back home -- or simply walking. Anything between Rs 1,50,000 to Rs 3,00,000 is being charged for an inhuman truck ride back home.On Thursday, 15 migrant workers died in accidents across three states, taking the total number of migrant workers who died to 110 since March 25 when the lockdown began.For almost a month, the only way the workers could return home was by walking , cycling, or hitching rides. Then, a few state governments started organising buses. The central government came out with a protocol on inter-state movement of migrants on buses -- all inter-state movement was barred until then -- in late April, and then, perhaps realising that trains were faster, safer, and could accommodate more, finally started running special Shramik trains on May 1, International Workers’ Day.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicOn Friday evening, the Union home ministry asked all states and Union Territories to make sure that workers didn’t have to walk back home and to facilitate their travel through special buses trains. But despite the launch of the trains, some workers have hired trucks, paying up to Rs 4,000 per passenger, to return home. Social activists said the workers are not willing to wait to take trains or buses -- most states say it could take a week or 10 days to organise the trains or buses.Huddled in container boxes, concrete mixture bins, and cargo compartments, the workers have taken almost non-stop journeys of up to 100 hours to reach their villages in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand, travelling from Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Telangana.Also Read: Govt officials propose more power to states in fight against Covid-19Maharashtra home minister Anil Deskmukh said the state government has provided migrant workers food and shelter and also transport to go back home. “We have also assured them that work will start soon and they should be patient,” he said. Yet, after weeks of the lockdown, many workers do not want to wait any longer. A report by Stranded Workers Action Network said that 79% of the workers returning are daily wage factory or construction workers and another 8% are domestic workers and drivers.“It is layered and a complex situation,” said Anandita Adhikhari, a doctorate student at Brown University, United States, who has anchored the network with close to 100 young volunteers from across India.SWAN’s study released on May 2 said around 72% of those returning home has almost run out of ration, usually provided by the local state government, and cash. Many said they did not receive salaries for March, nor cash handouts from the state.Adhikhari said most of the workers, including those who have stayed back in anticipation of work being available , have fallen into another cycle of debt as they have taken loans from landlords or local shopkeepers to sustain themselves during the lockdown.Also Read: Sops, reforms for farmers in third tranche of govt aidChhattisgarh based social activist Priyanka Shukla said most of the workers travelling have not received any help from their respective states. “They are on their own. Their stories are of pain and anguish, which should shame us all,” she said, directing a group of 40 migrant labourers, cycling from Uttar Pradesh’s Lucknow on way to their village in state’s Champa district, towards a water cooler at a gas filling station in Bilaspur.Shukla, who has documented travel of about 1000 migrant workers crossing Bilaspur in the past one week said: “About 200 workers cross Bilaspur every night on foot or cycling as they avoid the heat of the day. They are from Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and are coming from the southern states and Maharashtra.”Sataria Hembrom, 31, walked back to his village in Jharkhand’s Chaibasa from Mumbai, a distance of more than 1,800 km, with six others. All the seven worked at a construction site in Navi Mumbai, where the work stopped on March 22. Initially, they bought food from their savings. They lasted a month. Then they started running low on money.“We had two options; face Covid without food or walk home. They started their journey on May 2 and ended it on May 13, walking and hitching rides. Hembrom, who has blisters on his feet because of the walking, appreciated the assistance of policemen all along the way. “At some places police helped us to get a lift in trucks,” he said. Otherwise, they would just walk.Many of the workers have no money; whatever they had, including savings, went towards food, and to pay truck and bus drivers. “It was a horrible journey. One man fell down from the truck and hurt himself,” recalled Lakshmi Morya, an autorickshaw driver, who paid Rs 3,000 to a truck driver, to travel back to his village in Hardoi district of Uttar Pradesh. He reached on May 13, four days after starting from Goregaon in Mumbai, with 70 other people, all packed into the goods compartment of a truck.Joshana S, a resident of Pratiksha Nagar in Mumbai’s Sion, said two of her brothers-in-law have already left for Kanpur in trucks and two other relatives will leave on Thursday. “It is getting difficult to survive in Mumbai with no income for two months and all work avenues closed,” she said. Sunil Yadav, from the Pani Haq Samiti in Mumbai said small companies, where these migrants work, have stopped paying them or helping them with food.Some workers spent their money on cycles, paying anywhere between Rs 2000 to Rs 3000 to buy one and ride back home.And those that couldn’t afford either , simply walked -- like the 16 migrant workers from Madhya Pradesh, who were mowed down by a goods train while they were asleep on the tracks near Aurangabad in Maharashtra. Walking along railway tracks ensures two things, the workers said: one, there weren’t too many policemen around; and two, it kept them on the right track.Not all are on the road. many workers continue to languish in caps. Ramesh Kumar (26), a resident of Lakhimpur Kheri in Uttar Pradesh, and two-dozen of his friends, all working in the construction sector in north Kerala, decided to wak to Mangaluru from where they heard they could catch a train to Delhi. That was back in March.They were intercepted by the Kerala police and sent to a government shelter -- where they remain. “Government is providing food to us. But we are jobless for two months. Some of our relatives are starving back home. We are not slaves. We are desperate to go back.” Thus far, Kerala has seen 24 Shramik trains t o take back workers , but the state still has around 4 lakh migrant workers housed in 12,000-odd camps across the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-long-walk-back-home-migrants-battle-hunger-scourge-of-disease/story-TizRfUz69osJQ0Uqmm6jZN.html
16-05-2020||India||India goes past China in Covid-19 cases but withlower rate of fatalities||The number of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in India on Friday crossed the total count of infections in China, where the highly contagious disease originated late last year, even as experts pointed out that the outbreak has not been as deadly as in the neighbouring country at the same stage of transmissions.The Covid-19 cases in the country rose to 85,709 on Friday, according to HT’s dashboard, with 2,680 people having died so far of the respiratory illness. China has so far reported 82,933 Covid-19 cases, 4,633 of whom have died of the disease. Just four states – Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and Delhi – together account for two-thirds of India’s cases.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicIndia’s fatality rate was 3.23%, compared to the global death rate of 6.92%; the recovery rate was 34.06%, according to the latest figures released by the Union health ministry.Experts say that a national lockdown imposed in India on March 25 to slow the spread of the disease appeared to have been effective in slowing the infections. However, with the gradual easing of restrictions – necessitated by sluggish economic indicators – they expect the cases to rise in the coming days.China imposed a 76-day lockdown earlier this year in Wuhan, the city where the Sars-CoV-2 pathogen is believed to have jumped to humans. The move proved to be effective, with no Covid-19 death being reported in official figures in the neighbouring country over the last 30 days.Also Read: Concerns over infant mortality as Covid hits immunisation drives“Lowering the fraction of the people who test positive is a better indicator of whether new infections have been controlled than the doubling rate, which is flawed as it also takes into account old and active cases. A low fraction of positives among people tested indicates falling infection (rates) because as testing increases, so do the number of people who test positive,” said Dr K Srinath Reddy, president, Public Health Foundation of India.The spread of Covid-19 has been slower in India than in China and other parts of the world, according to epidemiologists.“The health systems in states haven’t been overwhelmed; there are no sudden unexplained hospitalisations and deaths, as seen during dengue or encephalitis outbreaks. The data from China is less reliable. There’s far more transparency in India, where attempts by some governments such as West Bengal to juggle death numbers have been quickly exposed,” said Dr Ambarish Dutta, associate professor of epidemiology and public health, Indian Institute of Public Health, Bhubaneswar. Also Read: IAS trainees gear up to join Covid-19 fight“We have more active cases (than in China) because the growth rate has been slow. The disease appears to be less severe in India; we still don’t have scientific evidence on why this is happening, it could be cross infections, it could be innate immunity or higher humidity and temperature, we still don’t know,” said Dutta.India’s recovery rate improved to 33.6%, up from 32.83% on Wednesday. Deaths in India are two per one million population, compared to three deaths per million in China. Data from the 50 countries with the most cases shows that deaths per million are the lowest in the two most populated nations in the world, except for Bangladesh.“If performance of hospitals is being compared, case fatality rate matters, but to assess an epidemic, state of the epidemic is being assessed, deaths per million is the statistic that tells us whether a district or state is in a safer zone than another,” said Reddy.With most states moving towards a staggered lifting of the lockdown, experts say the progress of the outbreak over the next few weeks will depend on the lessons learned so far.“You can’t police social distancing; people must learn to protect themselves. The acid test will be how we behave as we exit from the lockdown in the next few days,” said Dutta.Reddy said the lockdown imposed in China was largely effective in containing the infections. “China’s success is that it prevented the spread across the country with its rapid and complete lockdown. It locked down very quickly, and stopped domestic travel using the hukou system very rapidly, unlike India, where domestic travel was allowed till March 24, which led to multiple seeding of infection before lockdown,” said Reddy.The hukou system is a family registration programme that works as a domestic passport and is used to regulate travel and control population distribution.“The focus for India now is not rising cases, but the rate of spread of the disease. Covid-19 is here to stay, cases will go up; we have to be prepared for managing severe disease. India’s R0 is 1.4, we have to work to bring it below one to reverse the pandemic,” said an epidemiologist at the health ministry, requesting anonymity. To transition into a “new normal” in which social and economic life can function, the WHO recommends identifying hot spots and clusters, and building capacity of systems and responders to find, isolate and care for cases. “There can be no illusions, we are in this for the long haul. Covid-19 importation to Thailand was on January 13, but early and aggressive measures, including unprecedented physical distancing measures, have helped keep the number of cases low in the region as compared to other parts of the world,” said Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, Regional Director, WHO South-East Asia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-goes-past-china-in-covid-cases-but-withlower-rate-of-fatalities/story-1rlSwXO3Z2oVLNGDjpknYM.html
16-05-2020||India||‘How can we stop migrants from walking’, asks SC as it nixes plea||“How can we stop them from walking,” one of the judges on the bench remarked as the Supreme Court on Friday declined to entertain an application that sought a direction to the Union government to identify stranded migrant workers, take care of their needs, and provide free transport to them. The application, filed by lawyer Alakh Alok Srivastava cited the accident in Aurangabad on May 8 when 16 migrant workers walking back home to Madhya Pradesh from Maharashtra were mowed down by a goods train. The nationwide lockdown enforced by India on March 25 to slow the spread of the coronavirus disease left migrant workers without jobs and a way to get back home. It was only in late April that some states started transporting their workers back from other states using buses and only on May 1 that the government started running special trains for them. Srivastava had earlier filed a petition in March, citing efforts by the workers to walk back home to which the Centre responded in an affidavit on March 31, detailing various steps taken by it to address the issues raised in the petition. The new application filed by the petitioner referred to comments by solicitor general Tushar Mehta, when filing the earlier affidavit -- that “there is no person walking on the roads in an attempt to reach his/her home towns/villages.”The central government, in response to the earlier petition, had said that there were 26,476 relief and shelter camps across the country housing about one million migrant workers and other people in need.The court disposed of that case on April 27.On Friday, the bench headed by justice L Nageswara Rao left it to the states concerned to take action to deal with the problem, maintaining that it could not pass orders based on media reports. “ It is impossible for this court to monitor who is walking and who is not walking,” justice Rao said.The central government told the court that migrant workers were leaving cities on foot, though travel arrangements were made by way of running of special trains. “They are not waiting for their turn and they start walking. They may wait for their turn rather than starting on foot,” solicitor general Mehta, who was representing the central government, told the court. Mehta also said that using force to stop migrant workers from walking home would be counterproductive.“Your knowledge is based on newspaper reports. How can you expect us to pass orders? Let the states take action,” the SC bench told the petitioner, dismissing his application.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-can-we-stop-migrants-from-walking-asks-sc-as-it-nixes-plea/story-hTGOakTTSV1dPSpbZFdk3I.html
16-05-2020||India||Sops, reforms for farmers in third tranche of govt aid||Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Friday announced a mix of financial, legislative and reform measures aimed largely at increasing the pricing power of farmers – or share of profits in farm incomes – by proposing to dismantle historical domestic trade barriers, bring new laws for freer food and commodities markets, and better infrastructure. Sitharaman’s third tranche of measures, aggregating Rs 1.63 lakh crore and part of a larger Rs 20-lakh crore stimulus, did not contain any direct cash transfer programme for farmers, or money in hand, but is a mix of new allocations and top-up to existing agriculturally critical schemes, some them announced in Budget 2020-21 in February. Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicIt is also an attempt to push through critical legislative reforms that can free up India’s agricultural markets and improve farm incomes. Farming, the largest source of livelihoods, supports nearly half of all Indians and it has been hobbled by myriad archaic regulations. According to estimates by economists and securities research firms, the measures announced thus far add up to around Rs 18.3 lakh crore (including around Rs 5.7 lakh crore of monetary measures taken in March by the central bank, and the Rs 1.7 lakh crore welfare package announced in late March ). Finance ministry officials said there will be two more tranches -- one to be announced on Saturday and the other on Sunday. DK Srivastava, chief policy advisor at consultancy firm EY India, said, “One salient feature of this tranche is that the direct fiscal cost (or cash spending) accounts for nearly 30% of the estimated benefit, which is much higher than that in earlier two tranches.”His reference is to the fact that the fiscal cost of the previous tranches is estimated by economists at a fraction of the overall number – a Credit Suisse report put the fiscal cost of the Rs 1.7 lakh crore welfare package, the Rs 5.7 lakh crore monetary measures, and the first tranche of Rs 5.94 lakh crore announced on Wednesday at around Rs 55,000 crore. On Friday, the finance minister announced Rs 1 lakh crore to fund new farm-gate infrastructure, or simply agricultural produce markets, harvest management facilities, and a law to permit farmers to freely sell their produce to any trader of their choice, potentially ending persistent trade barriers in food trade that have been characterised by so-called agricultural market produce committees (APMCs). Sitharaman said a mechanism would be fixed to assure profitable prices for farmers, which means at least a baseline profitable price signal available at the “time of sowing”. This is referred to as price discovery, whereby farmers will be able to estimate crop prices before taking sowing decisions so that they are able to grow commodities for which there will be demand. “A central law will be formulated to provide adequate choices to farmers to sell produce at attractive price, barrier-free inter-state trade and a framework for e-trading of agriculture produce.”She also outlined proposed changes to an existing commodity rationing law, The Essential Commodities Act (ESA), to ease farm trade. “The government will amend the Essential Commodities Act to enable better price realisation for farmers by attracting investments and making agriculture sector competitive,” she said.The indication is that the government will use the law more sparingly, a proposal for which had been made by an interministerial panel to reform the sector in January. The ESA allows the government to decide how much stock wholesale traders or even retailers can store, legally called “stock limits”. Cereals, edible oils, oilseeds, pulses, onions and potato will be deregulated, she said. Stock limits will be imposed under very exceptional circumstances, such as national calamities or during price gouging. The finance minister, responding to a question, rejected the Opposition’s charges that much of her announcements were re-allocated spending and had included taxpayer refunds. “We have included schemes announced in the Budget. But amounts are being disbursed now. When was the Budget? In February. When we are giving expedited tax refunds, it is taxpayers money. I am specifically saying that,” Sitharaman said.These reforms in “agricultural marketing”, or the mandi system that controls buying and selling of farm produce, have been a long time in the making. Various government panels and economists have often argued for changing the existing structures of agricultural trade. APMC regulations require farmers to only sell to licensed middlemen in notified markets, usually in the same area where a farmer resides, rather than in an open market.They often act as cartels, evidence suggests. In December 2019, when prices peaked during the last major spike, a probe by the country’s statutory anti-monopoly body, the Competition Commission of India (CCI), revealed that one firm accounted for nearly a fifth of the total onion trading for that month at Lasalgoan APMC, Asia’s largest onion market in Maharashtra’s Nashik.Ushered in during the 1960s, APMC regulations require farmers to only sell to licensed middlemen in notified markets, usually in the same area as the farmer, rather than directly to buyers elsewhere. These rules were meant to protect farmers from being forced into distress selling.Under the APMC system, farmers have to go through smaller crop aggregators to access bulk buyers. Over time, this has spawned layers of intermediaries spanning the farm-to-fork supply chain. This results in a large “price spread”, or the fragmentation of profit shares due to the presence of several middlemen. Farmers often get the lowest shares.EY’s Srivastava added that “the focus on agriculture and allied sectors in this third tranche of the stimulus package may be justified due to its large share in employment. These reforms are both welfare-improving and efficiency-augmenting”.“Terms of trade has moved away from agriculture. That is what the government appears to have realised and trying to correct,” said economist YK Alagh. His reference is to the total prices paid by farmers in running their households versus total prices received by selling their produce.Agriculture in India suffers negative total revenues, or negative terms of trade implying that assets going out of the sector are more than those flowing in. Farming, therefore, has steadily become an unprofitable occupation, according to a landmark 2018 study by the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), a grouping of 36 countries, and the New Delhi-based think-tank ICRIER.The government will bring in a facilitative legal framework to enable farmers for engaging with processors, aggregators, large retailers, exporters, etc, in a fair and transparent manner, the minister said. “This will ensure assured returns and risk mitigation for farmers.” “A central law to enable farmers to sell to a buyer of their choice including online channels and marketplaces is expected to go a long way in maximizing farmer realisations while minimizing intermediary transaction costs. Farmers would be able to avail of price discovery and sell their products on both government platforms like e-NAM and private online grocery platforms,” said Arindam Guha, an economist with Deloitte India. To improve animal husbandry incomes, which gives higher net returns compared to crops, Sitharaman said: “We want to ensure 100% vaccination of nearly 530 million animals, a livestock size which is among the largest in the world. Despite Covid-19 lockdown, 15 million cows and buffaloes have been tagged and vaccinated.” To control foot and mouth diseases, which cripples milk output of afflicted animals, the FM announced Rs 13,343 crore. The government will set up an Animal Husbandry Infrastructure Development Fund worth Rs 15,000 crore to “support private investment in dairy processing, value addition and cattle feed infrastructure”.The government will implement a scheme for infrastructure development related to beekeeping, according to the finance minister, aiming to increase incomes of 200,000 beekeepers. The government has extended the Operation Greens for Tomatoes, Onion and Potatoes (TOP) to all fruits and vegetables. Under this, 50% subsidy would be given on transportation from surplus to deficient markets and 50% subsidy on storage. The finance minister also allotted Rs 4,000 crore for herbal plantations. “These initiatives may prove good in the long run but they do not solve the problem of farmers whose harvests perished because of the lockdown. It is clear that the government is in no mood to compensate these losses directly,” said economist Sudhir Panwar, a former member of the erstwhile UP State Planning Commission. All told, the government on Friday announced funding worth Rs 1.63 lakh crore. This includes Rs 10,000 crore for micro food enterprises, Rs 20,000 crore for fisheries, Rs 500 crore for beekeeping and another Rs 500 crore for Operation TOPs, the vegetables mission. So far, the government has unveiled measures worth over Rs 9.1 lakh crore in the earlier two tranches since Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s address to the nation on May 12.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sops-reforms-for-farmers-in-third-tranche-of-govt-aid/story-A8ehBXnhqtJR5EpBOJkQ1J.html
16-05-2020||India||3 hunters, 50 officials pursue tiger under shadow of pandemic in Kerala||For almost a week now, three hunters, 50 forest and district officials and some of the residents of Thannithode, a village in central Kerala’s Pathanamthitta district, are on the trail of a big cat which strayed into a human habitation and killed a rubber tapper last week.The cat is smart. The hunters tried to bait the tiger with a live goat, but while they were waiting for it, the tiger attacked and killed a cow elsewhere in the village.It’s since been seen at many places around the village, attacked more cows, even goats and dogs; forest department officials have been using night vision cameras and drones, but while the tiger has been spotted several times, it has eluded all efforts to capture it.  Meanwhile, the 13,000-odd villagers of Thannithode are reeling under the impact of a double lockdown. The village is surrounded by sparse forests. The closest deep forest is at least 25 km away. And the closest tiger reserve, Periyar, is 105km away. To be sure, it isn’t strange to find a tiger outside the reserve, although it is unusual for the apex predator to come close to a human habitation. That’s more like how leopards behave. It all began with the attack on rubber tapper Bineesh Mathew (38) on May 6 who was attacked in a rubber plantation in Thannithode when he went to tap trees. When his colleagues heard his cries , they rushed to where he was, just in time to see a tiger dragging him away. They pelted stones and yelled, and the tiger dropped him and escaped into the forest. Mathew suffered deep gashes on his throat and chest and died on the spot. Later, Pathanamthitta district collector PB Nooh issued prohibitory orders in the village, ensuring people didn’t move around.“It is a big tiger. It could either be old or injured. The attack happened around 12 noon,” said T Mathew, another tapper, who witnessed the attack.“We have faced threats of elephants, wild boars and other animals. But this is the first time we are facing a tiger. We really dread to allow our children outside our house,” said MS Indira, a panchyat member .Wildlife experts said tiger attacks are very rare in Kerala which houses two tiger reserves and five wildlife sanctuaries.The state has 190 tigers, according to the last tiger census in 2019.“We are trying our best to tranquillise it and shift it to deep forests. Many top forest and veterinary department officials are camping in the area and we will try our best to capture the tiger alive. If this fails, we will shoot it,” said state forest minister K Raju, who announced a relief of ₹10 lakh to the family members of the victim. Conservationists have asked the government to try and relocate the animal.“Though shooting order was given by the chief wildlife warden, it will be our last option. We had set up four different cages but the animal has eluded them all. Some of the best vets and tranquilliser experts like Dr Arun Zachariah are on the job,” the minister said.Conservationists have asked the government to try and relocate the animal. “Shooting a tiger needs special permission from the National Conservation Authority. One has to be 100% certain that the animal is a man-eater. The killing of a human being could have been accidental. It is easy to kill a big cat, but before arriving at a decision we should be sure about it. The best way forward would be to capture the tiger and relocate it,” Dr PS Esa, wildlife expert and activist, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-hunters-50-officials-pursue-tiger-under-shadow-of-pandemic/story-HaImSH7BLqBY1BzagJ0zVL.html
16-05-2020||India||IAS trainees gear up to join Covid-19 fight||A majority of trainee Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officers--96 out of 182--left Mussoorie’s Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration for their respective districts by road amid the national Covid-19 lockdown last week to begin their year-long field training as assistant collectors. The rest, allotted postings in farther states, are awaiting the resumption of flights to follow suit, officials aware of the matter said. Trainee officers normally spend anywhere between a month and three months at state academies mostly at the beginning of their field training and attend lectures. Officials said due to the unprecedented nature of the Covid-19 pandemic, they are being moved directly to districts. “Those who could travel by road left on Saturday morning for their respective districts. The others, who will be travelling to states such as Sikkim, Assam, Telangana, Karnataka and West Bengal, are waiting for flights to resume,” said an official at the Academy, which is India’s premier training institution for civil servants. The official said the trainees left after their convocation was held on May 8.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicSome of the 96 officers travelled in cars sent by their respective states to pick them up from the Academy while others first travelled on 30-seater buses from Mussoorie to Delhi before leaving for their districts. “There were 15 of us on each bus to ensure social distancing norms,” said a Rajasthan cadre trainee officer. “Once we reached Delhi, seven of us were screened at the Rajasthan House, where we stopped for lunch.” The officer said after that, they took cars and reached Jaipur on Saturday evening. Each car had two people. The officer said normally, they have month-long lectures at the state academy. “But this year, we are moving directly to our districts... on Wednesday.” The officer said he had been in touch with the collector of his district. “My district is in a red zone... We have also had call-ins with various additional secretaries to understand what [our] different roles will entail.” The officer said there was a feeling of apprehension, anxiety and excitement at starting work during the pandemic. “This is a once in a lifetime learning opportunity. We have a lot of questions but are eager to learn.”A second trainee officer, who was picked up from the academy, said he reported directly at his district, a Covid-19 hotspot, in Uttar Pradesh on Sunday. “... I went to one of the areas where people had tested positive for Covid-19,” the second trainee said. “Today, I was attached to the DC at the railway station where a train with migrant labourers from Ahmedabad arrived.”The second officer said he observed the overall process of screening of the labourers, understood the quarantine norms and how to distribute rations. “It is a great first-hand learning experience.”Those, who are still at the academy, are brushing up their regional language skills and getting clued in about the state administrations. “Since many of them are not familiar with the regional languages, they are taking language courses, watching films and keeping tabs on the local news,” said the official cited above. “Many are also in touch with the respective state administrations. ...the West Bengal trainees had a video call with the principal secretary of health over the weekend.”A trainee from the Assam cadre said they were in touch with the state government to work out the transportation details. “Travel by road or trains to our districts, nearly 2,000 km away, would not have been feasible. So we are waiting for flights to resume.” The Assam cadre trainee said they spoke to officials about their roles, the procedures they will have to follow, especially in light of the pandemic, once they reach their districts. “We are using the Microsoft Teams app to do our video calls with senior officials and learning how schemes like MGNREGS [Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme] will play a crucial role in the coming days.” Padamvir Singh, the former Academy director, said the role of assistant collectors under training depends on their supervisors--the district collectors (DCs) and district magistrates (DMs). “This is the time they spend learning about the different departments they will be in charge of as DCs and DMs,” said Singh. “However, in this pandemic situation, they can be used to collect data and help out in administration. They have no legal powers. So their role will be ancillary.”Singh added that after spending some time under training, an officer can also be put in charge of their own projects. “Since they have no legal powers yet, they can effectively act as helping hands so long as their training is not hampered.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ias-trainees-gear-up-to-join-covid-19-fight/story-nd4nNuDaoBG8SW8edlwImJ.html
16-05-2020||India||Concerns over infant mortality as Covid-19 hits immunisation drives||The involvement of accredited social health activists (Asha) and anganwadi workers primarily in Covid-19 related activities has triggered fears about its possible fallout on efforts to check infant mortality because of their basic work related to immunisation and meeting nutritional requirements for children in rural areas.The work of anganwadi workers includes the supply of nutritious food to children in villages while the promotion of universal immunisation is among the key responsibilities of an Asha.“With the immunisation drive in India coming to a standstill, and as we are diverting our resources to Covid-related activities, the fear is that this might undo any good progress...,” said an official of government think-tank Niti Aayog, which is involved in the Poshan Abhiyaan to check malnutrition. According to the 2018 Sample Registration System Bulletin released on May 9, India’s infant mortality rate has declined from 33 deaths per 1000 live births in 2017 to 32 in 2018. The rate rose in Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, and Jharkhand. National Institute of Nutrition (Hyderabad) director R Hemalatha said these numbers mean that India is missing the targets for the Sustainable Development Goals 2030, or a to-do list for tackling conflict, hunger, land degradation, gender inequality, and climate crisis. “India will miss the same targets for neonatal mortality rate, or infant mortality rate, which require us to have 12 deaths per 1000 live births by 2030. If the same trends continue, we might be able to realise the under-5 mortality rate of 25 deaths per 1000 live births,” said Hemlatha.The National Institute of Nutrition was involved in the drafting of the bulletin. The Niti Aayog official cited above said the one-point decline in the national infant mortality rate shows that the pace of decline has been arrested. The rate in 2013 was 40, 39 in 2014 and 37 in 2015. It fell to 34 in 2016. In 2017 and 2018, the rate was 33 and 32.Anganwadi workers and helpers under the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) programme visit homes to teach women about the importance of nutrition, hygiene, pregnancy care and the immunisation among other things. They help supply supplementary nutrition and collect the data needed for the delivery of services. India faces a shortage of health workers with a doctor-population ratio of 1:1,457 against a prescribed 1:1,000 and relies heavily on the anganwadi and Asha network for public health duties. Asha and anganwadi workers have been engaged in contact tracing of Covid-19 patients in their localities across the country as their centres have been shut down since the lockdown to check the spread of the pandemic was announced in late March. Bihar principal secretary (health) Sanjay Kumar said the immunisation was stopped on March 24 before it was restarted on May 6. He said the immunisation has played a key role in Bihar’s 3-point decline in the infant mortality rate. He said anemia is a key problem in Bihar and the ICDS resources the anganwadi network delivers are crucial.Assam chief secretary Kumar Sanjay Krishna said Asha and anganwadi workers have over the last three months been primarily engaged in contact tracing duties. “But we decided that the immunisation has to go on...”Rakhi Dandona, a professor at the Public Health Foundation of India, said the effect of this year’s activities will be found in a few years, but there is a genuine concern among health practitioners. “We had made a lot of gains in maternal care, and are we going to lose some of that? We do not know yet. But we know home deliveries would have gone up, and antenatal care and the immunisation activities have gone down.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/concerns-over-infant-mortality-as-covid-hits-immunisation-drives/story-NHHjoyN5vcIWAle3nV0Z5M.html
16-05-2020||India||Govt notifies guidelines for practising telemedicine||The government has gazette notified guidelines to practice telemedicine in India, a significant step as telemedicine consultation was a grey area in India.The experts in the centre had been working on drafting standard guidelines that doctors could refer to because of the challenges posed for in-person consultation owing to the country’s large size and varied topography.Telemedicine is referred to the delivery and facilitation of health and health-related services including medical care, provider and patient education, health information services, and self-care via telecommunications and digital communication technologies, a practice that has gained significance globally over the past few years with advances in technology. Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicIn India it had been a somewhat grey area because there was no central guideline regulating the practice even though some states had come out with individual guidelines. The centre had been in the process of drafting these guidelines for sometime that got expedited because of the restrictions imposed by the sudden lockdown.The Board of Governors in supersession of the Medical Council of India (MCI), has been working on the guidelines amended the Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations, 2002, to include telemedicine consultation. However, the guidelines prohibit use of digital technology to conduct surgical or invasive procedures remotely.“We had already put in six months of work into the guidelines and, when the coronavirus pandemic happened, we expedited it. Technology platforms were something available and being used, but were not regulated, which exposed both patients and providers to challenges…” Dr Nikhil Tandon, head, department of endocrinology and metabolism, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, had explained earlier when the draft was out during March end. Dr Tandon is a member of the Board of Governors, MCI.The release of guidelines that aim at protecting both patients and practitioners got expedited because of the restrictions on movement imposed during the national lockdown to contain the pandemic, as the practice provides patient’s safety, as well as health workers’ safety, especially in situations where there is risk of contagious infections.“Disasters and pandemics pose unique challenges to providing health care. Though telemedicine will not solve them all, it is well suited for scenarios in which medical practitioners can evaluate and manage patients. A telemedicine visit can be conducted without exposing staff to viruses/infections in the times of such outbreaks. Telemedicine practice can prevent the transmission of infectious diseases reducing the risks to both health care workers and patients,” the guidelines say.“…It can provide rapid access to medical practitioners who may not be immediately available in person. In addition, it makes available extra working hands to provide physical care at the respective health institutions. Thus, health systems that are invested in telemedicine are well positioned to ensure that patients with Covid-19 kind of issues receive the care they need.”In the long run, there is a special focus on Health and Wellness Centres that provide preventive and primary healthcare within a 5 km radius at the grassroots level, especially in remote and largely inaccessible areas.There are a number of benefits of telemedicine. It increases timely access to appropriate interventions, including faster access to services that may not otherwise be available.One of the major advantages of telemedicine, say experts, can be saving cost and effort, especially of rural patients, as they need not travel long distances for obtaining consultation and treatment.The practice can be particularly helpful for patients who need a follow up consultation but do not have to be physically present for a check-up, which will, in turn, reduce the burden on the secondary hospitals.“There are a number of technologies that can be used in telemedicine, which can help patients adhere better to their medication regimens and manage their diseases better. Telemedicine can also enable the availability of vital parameters of the patient to the physician with the help of medical devices such as for blood pressure, blood glucose, etc management,”the guidelines further mention.The results from the home montiring devices can be directly uploaded online for a physician to access, and advise accordingly.The expert document has also provided a list of medicines that can be prescribed by doctors to treat patients.Telemedicine includes all channels of communication with the patient that leverage information technology platforms, including voice, audio, text and digital data exchange.However, telemedicine services cannot be used for providing emergency care when alternative in-person care is available. Also, it should largely be limited to first aid, life-saving measure, counselling and advice on referral.Health care providers say it is a welcome move, not just the under current circumstances but also in the long run, when physical examination is not required.“It will help to have a standard operating guidelines in place as earlier different guidelines were emerging from different states. Apollo has a telemedicine programme running for long, and through our network we cater to states such as Andhra Pradesh, Jharkhand, and higher reaches of Himachal Pradesh such as Kaza and Keylong. The formal notification will help us scale up and reach out to a larger population base. It anyway doesn’t make sense for a patient to come all the way to a health facility just to show, say, blood reports,” says Dr Anupam Sibal, group medical director, Apollo Hospitals.“Also, telehealth is definitely going to be a key component of the new normal that we are going to see in the post-pandemic world,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-notifies-guidelines-for-practisingtelemedicine/story-zSVg6KuS98xedy8rHGQdIL.html
16-05-2020||India||Govt officials propose more power to states in fight against Covid-19||The country may continue to be divided into red, orange, and green zones, after the current phase of lockdown ends on May 17, but it could be the states deciding the classification, officials involved in the Central government’s deliberations on the matter said. To be sure, no decision has been taken on this. The Centre is currently evaluating suggestions from the states on the next phase of the lockdown (or if there should be one) and is expected to issue guidelines shortly. Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicAt the meeting between the Prime Minister and chief ministers last week, several CMs raised the issue of zoning and also pointed out that focusing on containment zones, and classifying them as red, orange, and green, would probably work better than classifying an entire district. Also Read: Need to wait on resuming air travel: Niti Aayog memberThe discussions, the officials added, are also looking at whether smaller areas within districts can be used for the classification. The aim is to open up more areas for economic activities.One plan is for the Centre to define the three zones and leave the rest to the states, one of the officials said, asking not to be named. Under the current system, the union government divides different districts into red, orange and green zones based on the data provided by the state and then shares the details with the states every week.At the meeting between the PM and the CMs last week, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, and Punja CM, Captain Amarinder Singh asked the centre to give them more powers to demarcate red or orange zones to allow more economic activities.According to functionaries present in the meeting, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal proposed a division based on containment and non-containment zones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-officials-propose-more-power-to-states/story-jsiX6SJgAQfdMxlCt7WLlO.html
16-05-2020||India||‘Need to wait on resuming air travel’: Niti Aayog member||India needs to wait for flights to resume because the air that circulates inside the plane’s pressurised cabin may be conducive to the spread of the coronavirus disease, a senior member of the government’s team to combat Covid-19 said on Friday. The comments by Dr Vinod Paul, Niti Aayog member and head of the empowered group overseeing the Covid-19 medical emergency management plan, came even as a senior civil aviation ministry official told HT that the ministry was now ready to begin operations, which were suspended when a nationwide lockdown was clamped on March 25. International operations were stopped three days earlier. “We should wait for flights to start,’’ said Dr Paul said on a day the Airports Authority of India (AAI) issued standard operating procedures for passengers to follow when flights resume.“There are issues which need further study,’’ he added. “Mainly the issue is of the pressurised cabin. This could be conducive to the spread of the disease. Also, it’s the same air which will be shared by all. So we have to think very carefully before we begin flying about the implications of it all.’’To be sure, a final decision on when to resume flying is yet to be taken. Globally, research has suggested that the virus can be transmitted through air conditioning but no conclusive studies have proven that air travel is any worse than surface transport. A senior government official said on condition of anonymity said that the view that the condition was not right for air travel to resume was a view expressed by not just Dr Paul but other health professionals that the government was consulting. These professionals included experts from the Indian Council of Medical Research, the country’s apex biomedical research body. However, the official said that there were economic costs to suspending air travel and that the government may have to eventually find a way around the problem. “There are many countries which never stopped flights,’’ said this official. “The air in a pressurised cabin is recycled and is perhaps cleaner than regular air.’’ The concern about air conditioning has been expressed before, especially when the Railways resumed services for migrant labourers and later, special passenger trains, last week. “As per the ministry of health guidelines, centralised AC is acceptable provided complete air change inside an AC coach takes place at least 12 times per hour,’’ the national transporter said in a statement. When asked about the resumption of rail services, Dr Paul said airlines would also resume but only after the authorities found way to minimise the risks. It could be in the form of allowing only those who had tested positive for Covid-19 antibodies, for instance, he added. Earlier in the day, the AAI, which manages 100-odd airports in India, said air travelers must maintain a distance of four feet from co-passengers, wear a mask and other protective gear, wash or sanitise their hands frequently and carry a 350 ml bottle of sanitiser all the time. Downloading the Aarogya Setu app in mobile phones will be mandatory and passengers will have to do a web check-in before the journey and a carry a print out of the boarding pass.The stamping of boarding passes has also been suspended to reduce contact between passengers and security staff.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/need-to-wait-on-resuming-air-travel-niti-aayog-member/story-ridY6sQIog1CHrWvKOH0IO.html
16-05-2020||India||States look to ease curbs, restart interstate travel in lockdown 4.0||Several states on Friday submitted their proposals for Covid-19 lockdown 4.0, asking the Centre to allow interstate travel, easier movement in non-containment zones and sectors like tourism and hospitality to restart work to revive the economy, multiple officials said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday said suggestions from the states would be considered for formulating guidelines for the next phase of the lockdown to check the pandemic spread, which is expected to begin from May 18. He said the next set of the curbs are going to be different from the earlier lockdowns. The Centre is likely to allow more flexibility to the states in formulating the fresh lockdown guidelines.Officials said Punjab has suggested doing away with the zoning system (red, orange and green) based on the scale of the Covid-19 cases with no activity allowed in the areas falling under the first category. It wants all activities to be allowed in non-containment areas. “We have also suggested that all public transport buses should run and shops, except malls, be allowed to open,” said an official on condition of anonymity. The state wants the lockdown to be extended till May end, the official added. Also Read: Delhi wants to restart life from Monday — with social distanceAssam chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal said they have written to the Centre seeking an extension of the lockdown by another two weeks and financial help. Sonowal said providing employment to a large number of migrants workers, who have returned to the state because of the lockdown, remains a big challenge.Uttarkhand has sought permission to allow Char Dham pilgrimage and tourist activities, which are the mainstay of the state’s economy. “We have requested the Centre to allow some tourism activities in green zones and the opening of a few holy shrines. We also want work under the MGNREGS [National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme] to be allowed for 150 days [from 100 days annually],” said Uttarakhand minister Madan Kaushik.Kaushik echoed ministers in other Bharatiya Janata Party-ruled states and said they will follow the Centre’s guidelines on the next phase of curbs. Also Read: Delhi to await Centre guidelines before taking call on liquor stores, home deliveriesOfficials in Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh said the chief ministers of these states have submitted their suggestions to the Centre and will provide details only after the notification on fresh guidelines is issued.The Kolkata Municipal Corporation on Friday announced buses in the city will run from Monday with a maximum 20 passengers on each bus and that police will ensure social distancing is maintained even as transport operators appeared sceptical. “It would be a difficult task [to limit passengers to 20] but we are making plans,” said Bengal Bus Syndicate honorary secretary Subrata Ghosh. The traditional yellow-coloured cabs will also resume services in Kolkata from Monday with increased fares. “Passengers will have to pay 30% extra... Not more than two passengers will be allowed and they will have to sit on the back seat. They will also need to wear masks and sanitise their hands,” said Bengal Taxi Association general secretary Bimal Guha.Gujarat has suggested the lockdown should be reviewed after two weeks. “We should see how people react to the relaxations and their impact on Covid-19 cases,” an official said, and added authorities have been asked to strictly monitor the impact of the next phase of the lockdown. “Shops and private offices may be opened on a rotational basis. Rules for rickshaws, taxis, city buses and other transport would be decided soon. Also, multiplexes, malls, gyms, and clubs will remain closed...”Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant said he will urge the Centre to allow all activities and take measures to restart the hospitality industry.

The state did not implement the relaxations allowed during the ongoing third phase of the lockdown because of a spurt in Covid-19 cases due to the return of the migrant workers.Officials in Himachal Pradesh said bus services will resume from May 18 between district headquarters even as the lockdown restrictions will continue till May end. “This has been done keeping in mind the difficulties faced by the people in commuting,” said principal secretary (revenue) Onkar Chand Sharma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-look-to-ease-curbs-restart-interstate-travel-in-lockdown-4-0/story-LeTMImPbdxYK2WRpA97awI.html
16-05-2020||India||30 areas reporting most cases: Centre||Thirty municipal areas account for 79% of India’s coronavirus disease (Covid-19) caseload, but the country has done better than others in terms of reducing the fatality rate, the government said on Friday. While caseload of an area means the number of total cases that place is reporting, fatality rate refers to the percentage of deaths among those infected. India’s death rate, containment strategy and medical infrastructure, among other issues, were discussed on Friday at the 15th meeting of a high-level group of ministers (GoM) headed by Union health minister Harsh Vardhan.According to the government, authorities will focus on states with highest number of cases and fatalities. Priority will also be given to treatment and fatality management. Timely detection of fresh infections and contact tracing will be strengthened.Also Read: US will donate ventilators to help India fight Covid-19: TrumpA health ministry statement said the GoM was informed that worldwide Covid-19 cases stood at 42,48,389 with 294,046 deaths. The fatality rate of 6.92% was higher than India’s 3.23%, the statement said, putting the total number of cases in the country at 81,970 and deaths at 2,649.So far, a total of 27,920 people have been cured of the viral infection. The number for the last 24 hours was 1,685 patients. “This takes the total recovery rate at 34.06%,” said the statement.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicA senior health ministry official, who did not want to be named, said states are now facing challenges with the return of migrant workers from different parts of the country as well as with people returning from aboard.“...measures are being taken to ensure there is no spread of infection. States will also start testing the target population to check for prevalence of the disease in this category. Whatever needs to be done is being done,” the official said.The health ministry statement noted that while India’s case doubling rate before the lockdown announced on March 25 was 3.4 days, the number stood at 12.9 days in the past week.Also Read: Mumbai reports 933 Covid-19 cases in one dayThe group also discussed India’s containment strategy to deal with the contagion, and the measures being taken by the Centre and states.Civil aviation minister Hardeep S Puri, foreign minister S Jaishankar, MoS home Nityanand Rai, MoS health and family welfare Ashwini Kumar Choubey, MoS shipping and chemical and fertilizers Mansukh Lal Mandaviya, and chief of defence staff Bipin Rawat were among those present in the meeting.The high-level team also discussed India’s medical infrastructure.At present, a total of 8,694 facilities comprising 919 dedicated Covid-19 hospitals; 2,036 Covid-19 health centres; and 5,739 Covid-19 care centres are available in the country, health minister Vardhan said.These facilities have a total of 277,429 beds for severe and critical cases; 29,701 intensive care unit beds (ICU); and 515,250 isolation beds. Also, 18,855 ventilators are now available to take care of critically ill patients as compared to 14,000 in March-end.The Centre has also provided 8.4 million N-95 masks and 4.8 million Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) kits to states and institutions under the central government. Domestic manufacturers have reached the production capacity of nearly 300,000 PPE kits, and about as many N-95 masks a day — sufficient to meet the requirement of the country in the near future, according to health ministry data.In addition, manufacturing of ventilators by domestic players has also started and orders have been placed. “We are comfortably placed as of now, and there is no cause for concern,” said the official quoted above.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/30-areas-reporting-most-cases-centre/story-pn2RbzgGsv9W8aB6ohFNAI.html
16-05-2020||India||SC defers summer vacation till June 19 to make up for time lost||The Supreme Court on Friday deferred its summer vacation till June 19 to make up for the loss of working hours due to the Covid-19 lockdown which has forced it to hold hearings of important cases via videoconferencing since March 23. However, it will continue to work through videoconferencing.In a notification, the court’s registrar said the vacation, which was scheduled to commence on May 18, stands rescheduled. The court will work during the five-week period from May 18 till June 19, he added.Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde took the decision to reschedule the vacation after taking into account views of the Supreme Court judges, people aware of the matter said.“The five-week period from May 18, 2020 to June 19, 2020 (both days inclusive) of the summer vacation of the Supreme Court calendar has been rescheduled and declared as period of functioning for the court,” the notification said.An earlier October 2019 notification on the list of holidays for the Supreme Court in 2020 has been modified to reflect this change.The Supreme Court’s month-and-half-long summer vacation usually begins in mid-May. Friday was expected to be the last working day of the top court ahead of the vacation this year. The court was to reopen on July 6. The CJI will now take a call on the summer vacation later. Supreme Court advocate M F Philip said the deferment will make up for the loss of working days. “They should have taken this decision earlier and not at the eleventh hour, and I would suggest that lawyers should be allowed to access their chambers within court premises.” Many high courts, including the Delhi High Court have already cancelled their summer vacations to make up for the loss of working hours due to the Covid-19 lockdown.The Supreme Court Bar Association passed a resolution on April 11 expressing willingness to work through the summer vacation. It had requested the CJI to cancel the summer vacation.The Supreme Court issued a circular on March 23 suspending entry of lawyers and litigants into the court premises. The court said that only extremely urgent cases will be taken up for hearings through video conferencing during the lockdown period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-defers-summer-vacation-till-jun-19-to-make-up-for-time-lost/story-bQqROamKW46Xisd8KA4cWN.html
16-05-2020||India||Tamil Nadu vegetable market cluster pushes state’s Covid-19 tally past 10k||As Tamil Nadu crossed 10,000 cases on Friday — the first case, a 45-year-old man with a travel history to Oman, was detected in early March — a wholesale market of fresh fruit, vegetables and flowers in Chennai became the latest warzone for the administration battling the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.According to a state government official, around 4,000 people linked to the market have already been tested out of which 1,000 are primary contacts. At least 2,500 positive cases currently pertain to the Koyambedu Market cluster, which is higher than the 1350 cases in the state linked to the Tablighi Jamaat religious conference.The Koyambedu hotspot is also responsible for cases in 10 districts other than Chennai. “We have either carried out facility quarantine or home quarantine of those who started the journey from Koyambedu,” the official quoted above said.Spread over 54 acres, Koyambedu market complex is one of the largest wholesale market complexes for perishable goods in India. It houses more than 1000 wholesalers and over 2000 retail shops. On May 4, 300 of the 527 new cases reported were found to be linked to the market. Within hours, it was shut down. According to S Ram Mohan, a core committee member of the Joint Action Committee of vegetable vendors’ associations at Koyambedu market, the district administration had shut down flower and fruit sales well before May 4. By then, even the vegetable retailers had stopped operations.On April 28, retail traders and fruit sellers from Koyambedu were relocated to a suburb. Expecting wholesalers to do likewise would have been difficult as few open spaces in the city have the capacity to handle 3,000 tonnes of vegetables each day, GD Rajasekaran, president, Koyambedu Periyar Market Association, said.On April 24, the state government announced a hard lockdown for four days, between April 26 and 29. This led to a spate in panic buying. Mohan recounted scenes of utter chaos in Koyambedu in the two days before the hard lockdown was enforced. On April 30, another round of panic buying ensued after people realized that the second leg of the national lockdown, which was expected to end on May 3, would likely be extended.Last week, chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami blamed the traders for not vacating the market in March itself. “Now, because many from Koyambedu had travelled to other districts, the number of infected there has gone up. This is the reason for the spike in cases in Chennai also,” he said. However, Mohan countered this and said that no official meeting was held between the wholesale vendors and the authorities in March or April.Super-spreading events have played a much bigger role in the virus spread in Tamil Nadu than in Maharashtra and Gujarat — two other states that have seen huge numbers of Covid-19 cases, experts said.The spike in numbers due to the Koyambedu cluster is immediately noticeable. Between April 24 and May 3, the average daily new cases reported in Tamil Nadu were 134; from May 4 to May 13, the average grew to 620 a day. Persons linked to the market have spread the virus the neighbouring states of Kerala and Andhra Pradesh.T Jacob John, a former professor of Virology, Christian Medical College (CMC), Vellore blamed ad-hoc decisions and panic among people because of the total lockdown. To contain the disease, all people must wear masks outside their home and maintain hand hygiene, he said.The good news is that the state is testing much more than it was even last month. The state had conducted the highest total number of tests as per the HT dashboard at 280,023 as of Thursday night, which translates into 4179 tests per million people, far higher than the national average of 1540 per million people.“The more you test, the more you find. Tamil Nadu is finding more cases because they are testing more,” said Dr V Ramana Dhara, professor at Indian Institute of Public Health-Hyderabad. “These cases are probably occurring in other states too, but they are not testing more,” he added.“The increase in number of cases is something to be expected especially as the most stringent components of the lockdown are relaxed. We are seeing the residual of a couple of major clusters, for instance, the Koyambedu cluster,” Dr Ram Gopalakrishnan, an infectious disease specialist said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tn-veggie-market-cluster-pushes-state-tally-past-10k/story-R1PnP3tSPGqM3VjcUxdXBP.html
16-05-2020||India||IAF to get first batch of Rafale jets by July-end||The Indian Air Force is likely to get the delivery of the first batch of four Rafale jets from France by July-end, people aware of the developments said on Friday. The four fighters were supposed to fly to their home base in India in May 2020, but the plan was delayed due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak. Confinement measures announced by France to battle the outbreak temporarily halted production at aircraft manufacturer Dassault Aviation’s Merignac facility.India ordered 36 Rafale jets from France in a deal worth Rs 59,000 crore in September 2016 as an emergency purchase to arrest the worrying slide in the air force’s combat capabilities.According to the delivery schedule, the first 18 jets (including the four in the first batch) are supposed to be delivered to the IAF by February 2021, with the rest expected by April-May 2022.France handed over to India its first Rafale fighter during a ceremony attended by defence minister Rajnath Singh and his French counterpart, Florence Parly, in Merignac on October 8, 2019, which coincided with the IAF’s 87th founding day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iaf-to-get-first-batch-of-rafale-jets-by-july-end/story-7MsrcyBC38Jq0twGHmU7zH.html
16-05-2020||India||Humans can pass Covid-19 infection to animals, shows research||Two dogs who were reported to have contracted the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) recently likely got the infection from their owners, according to a new research paper that analysed cases in animals in Hong Kong.“An analysis of viral genetic sequences from the dogs showed them to be identical to those in the infected people,” an article on the findings in Nature said.While the paper didn’t study if animal-to-animal transmission could occur, the authors recommended that for precaution, pets belonging to Covid-19 patients be isolated and tested, as is already being done in Hong Kong.The paper, published in Nature journal on Thursday, found that two of 15 dogs from households with confirmed human cases of Covid-19 in Hong Kong were found to be infected. These two were a 17-year-old neutered Pomeranian and a 2.5-year-old German Shepherd. They were tested using Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) kits and the virus was later isolated and sequenced.Canine ACE-2 (an enzyme the Sars-CoV-2 virus uses to enter the body) is similar to the enzyme found in humans. Of 18 amino acids that are known to be involved in interaction between ACE-2 and the spike receptor binding domain of Sars-CoV-2 (which Sars-CoV-2 uses to bind to its host’s cells), there are five that differ between humans and dogs, the study led by Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department of Hong Kong said.“The evidence suggests that human-to-animal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 can occur. We do not have information on whether this virus can cause illness in dogs but no specific signs were seen in either of the infected dogs during the time they were shedding virus,” the paper said. The Pomeranian died two days after release from isolation but very likely due to other underlying diseases. The German Shepherd was kept with a second cross-breed dog but the second dog didn’t get infected.“The limited implications of these findings are that there is now increasing evidence for human to animal transmission, especially to pet animals that are in close contact with infected humans. There is as yet no evidence for any subsequent animal to animal transmission,” said Abi Tamim Vanak, Fellow, DBT India Alliance Program and senior fellow at Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment (ATREE).“However, given that high viral loads were found in nasal swabs of infected animals, as well as in rectal swabs, there is a possibility of onward transmission to other animals, especially if an infected pet is free-ranging and regularly comes in to contact with other animals or humans. Again, this is only speculative, and it would require experimental challenge studies to determine if animal to animal transmission is a viable route of spread for this virus. If such evidence is found, then it will make the control of this disease much harder, because many regions of the world have fairly large populations of free-ranging domestic animals (e.g. India has ~60 million dogs), which do not receive even the most basic healthcare, such as anti-rabies vaccinations,” he added.The findings also have implications for future zoonotic transmission events. Dogs, other canids and felids can be sold in or found near wild-game animal markets like in Wuhan from where Sars-CoV-2 is understood to have transmitted to humans. These domestic animals should also be tested during investigations into the origin of the virus to determine if they play any role in spillover events, the authors concluded.Earlier, a study by Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences and National High Containment Laboratory for Animal Diseases Control and Prevention in China had suggested that cats are highly susceptible to contracting Sars-CoV-2 but dogs, ducks, chickens and pigs were not as susceptible. The study was based on lab experiments and not real-life cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/humans-can-pass-infection-to-animals-shows-research/story-VJmn6oimK3jvYcETnn9nlO.html
16-05-2020||India||World Bank gives $1 billion to India to aid social safety||The World Bank on Friday announced a US$1-billion “Accelerating India’s Covid-19 Social Protection Response Programme”, aimed at integrating India’s 400-plus fragmented social-security programmes for migrant workers hit by the outbreak, part of an initiative that seeks to rebalance access to safety nets between rural and urban India.The programme will especially focus on making social benefits such as subsidised food under the National Food Security Act, cash transfers and pensions portable so that beneficiaries can access them from anywhere in the country, not just from their home districts, the bank said.Portability simply refers to a digitised, universal and always-on platform, which ensures benefits move along with the migrants.Also Read: States look to ease curbs, restart interstate travel in lockdown 4.0“Very clearly, everybody recognises the shock (from the pandemic). The choice is being said to be between lives and livelihoods. This is not a choice the government of India is making,” Junaid Ahmad, country director of the bank said.Ahmad also said this is a “watershed moment” in social security of the country because the government has, for the first time, opened up an “important window” in the form of the state disaster response fund, which is now linked to social safety.The Union government, in the wake of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, allowed states to use the fund freely without usual approvals to provide social protection.A national lockdown that took effect from March 25 shuttered shops, factories and construction sites, pushing millions of migrant workers out of jobs. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Thursday announced free food assistance to 80 million migrant workers worth Rs 3500 core, part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Rs 20 lakh crore (Rs 20 trillion) economic package to pull the economy out of a slump.The first phase of the World Bank operation will be implemented countrywide through the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana (PMGKY). It will immediately help scale up cash transfers and food benefits, using a core set of pre-existing national platforms and programmes such as the Public Distribution System (PDS) and Direct Benefit Transfers (DBT), the bank said.Jobless migrant workers, hit by the lockdown, have fallen through the cracks because static social safety nets did not reach them in the absence of portability. “If the World Bank wants to streamline our social safety nets, first off, they are getting into very complicated things. The issue sometimes is not so much about how to reach the people as it is about how to get two wings of the government talking,” said economist Abhijit Sen, former member of the erstwhile Planning Commission. The arguments are on two things, Sen said: “One, don’t overcentralise things. Where the World Bank can intervene and should, is portability. Two, if I had to give out a billion dollars, then, I would give very little of that to the federal government and most of it to the states; in fact, more to the municipalities.”Over 90% of India’s workforce is employed in the informal sector, without access to basic savings or pensions, or paid leave from work.“There are large transfers to the rural poor. Look at the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana. The idea is to make social benefits such as food and cash transfers just as easily accessible for urban informal workers and migrants,” said World Bank lead of the project, Shrayana Bhattacharya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/world-bank-gives-1-billion-to-india-to-aid-social-safety/story-nIDccieXNOSrFV3TRR01LL.html
16-05-2020||India||States see higher tax revenue in third phase||Revenue collections of states have shown signs of recovery during the third phase of the Covid-19 lockdown with a higher collection of excise and Goods and Services Tax (GST) as industrial activities have increased and many government offices have resumed work, multiple officials across the country said.State governments last month reported a revenue dip of up to 90% and triggered fears that many of them may be unable to pay salaries for April. The relaxation in lockdown norms this month and the resumption of liquor sales have since boosted the revenue collections.Almost all states except Kerala, which have higher per capita liquor consumption, have allowed alcohol sales. Kerala has increased the tax on liquor ahead of the resumption of its sale from May 18 when the next phase of the lockdown will begin with new rules. The state will impose a 10% Covid-19 tax on beer and wine bottles priced below Rs 600. For the rest of the alcoholic beverages, the tax will be 35%. Punjab opened its liquor vends on Thursday.The officials cited above said the revenues, however, remain much less than what the states usually collect. The revenues from alcohol sales have also fallen after an initial rush at liquor shops once they were opened. Several officials said they were awaiting the Centre’s help in bridging the revenue gap, which is expected to continue because of a huge dip in demand.Haryana, where liquor sales were allowed from May 6, earned a revenue of Rs 93 crore till May 12 from them, state officials said. It is slightly higher than the tax collected during the same period last year--Rs 91.5 crore. In the first 12 days of this month, officials said Haryana has collected GST revenue worth Rs 340 crore compared to Rs 1,200 crore collected in May 2019.Officials said the stamp duty has also increased from May 1 when Haryana allowed registration of properties. “We expect better revenue from May 18 when the lockdown is expected to apply only to the containment zones,” said a Haryana official, who did not want to be named.Uttar Pradesh has reported liquor sales worth Rs 665 crore since May 4 when the state allowed them. State excise department officials said it is around Rs 250 to Rs 300 crore less than the sales recorded during the same period last year. “The lockdown is yet to be fully lifted and sales have been curtailed by three hours,” an official said, explaining less than expected liquor sales. Liquor sellers have appealed to the state government for more relaxations like not paying license fees for the lockdown period. “The government must give us a hearing. What are we going to do if the business crashes,” said Lucknow Liquor Sellers Welfare Association office-bearer Kanhaiyalal Maurya.An official in Rajasthan said the daily sales following the resumption of alcohol sale were as high as Rs 65 crore but the excitement is over. “Now it is Rs 45 crore, which is similar to daily revenue earned in May last year,” said the official on condition of anonymity. “The spirits have been dampened by adverse publicity by media,” the official said, referring to negative coverage over long queues at liquor shops in violation of the social distancing norms.Revenue from liquor sales in Maharashtra, the worst-hit state by the pandemic, from May 4-12 was half of what it earned during the same period last year. Officials said this was because restaurants and bars have remained closed and liquor sales were happening only through vends. Civic bodies in major cities like Mumbai and Nagpur have also not allowed liquor shops to open. Telangana, where the liquor sales started from May 6, revenue from them has also dipped after a good start. On May 6, the state earned 75 crore (as against average daily sales of Rs 60 crore), despite an increase in prices by 16%. “Since then, there been a fall in liquor sales by at least 60%,” said Telangana Wine Dealers’ Association president D Venkateshwar Rao.The government earned Rs 68.50 crore revenue despite a 50% increase in liquor prices on May 4 when the alcohol shops opened in Andhra Pradesh. On the second day, the revenue dipped as the prices were raised by another 25%. “The second-day sales were Rs 50-55 crore. It has almost been the same since then,” said special chief secretary (excise revenue) Rajat Bhargava.Telangana and Andhra Pradesh have reported a significant rise in revenue from the sale of stamps papers even as it remained less than what they collected during the same period in 2019. Officials in Karnataka said there has been a jump in the GST and other revenue collection. They said revenue from liquor sales was now back to the normal level of Rs 50-60 crore daily.Chhattisgarh has reported about an 80% increase in excise revenue in the first 12 days of May, as compared to April. Niranjan Das, the state’s excise commissioner, said there was about a 50% increase in liquor sales in the first two days of the resumption of liquor sales with per day average of Rs 28-30 crore. “Now, it is back to normal revenue of Rs 18-19 crore, including two crore from the online sale of liquor,” Das said. Officials said GST and stamp duty revenue has also seen some improvement.The government in Assam collected excise revenue of about Rs 150 crore in a week since the resumption of liquor sales. It is almost three times of what the state earned from the sale of liquor during the same time in 2019. “Last year, we collected Rs 2,700 crore from sale of liquor, and with the 25% hike [in prices from May 8], we expect to increase revenue by another Rs 1,000 crore,” said Assam excise minister Parimal Suklabaidya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-see-higher-tax-revenue-in-third-phase/story-twUXeTR5t8HQv4NaJ7vmuM.html
16-05-2020||India||Monsoon to be late by 4 days in Kerala||The onset of south-west monsoon over Kerala is likely to be delayed by four days and is expected to arrive on June 5, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Friday. The monsoon, however, is likely to arrive over the Andaman and Nicobar Islands four days in advance over the next 48 hours, it added.The onset over Kerala marks the beginning of the four-month monsoon season when India receives 70% of its annual rainfall. IMD’s south-west monsoon forecasts provide critical information to at least 700 million people in India, who are directly or indirectly dependent on agriculture for livelihood. The delay could have implications for farmers impacted by economic slowdown associated with the Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdown imposed to check its spread. The lockdown has disrupted the traditional farm-to-fork supply chains.The monsoon is crucial for the yield of rice, wheat, sugarcane, and oilseeds in a country where farming accounts for about 15% of the economy but employs over half of its people. The monsoon generally starts in June before it begins to retreat by Sept 1. In 2019, the monsoon started with the driest June in five years. Below-average precipitation followed in July before heavy rains caused flooding in August.An abnormally higher number of western disturbances affecting the western Himalayan are among the reasons that can make monsoon advancement slightly sluggish and delay its onset over Kerala. Western disturbances are low-pressure systems that generally originate over the Mediterranean region and are known to bring winter rain in India. Their intensity reduces in summer when they move to upper latitudes. “We are seeing stronger mid-latitude westerly activity, which will delay the establishment of monsoon flow over the Southern Peninsula,” said DS Pai, a senior scientist and monsoon expert at IMD, Pune.“At the same time, the development of cyclone near the Andaman and Nicobar Islands is pulling the monsoon winds to that region. So even if the monsoon is established, monsoon flow will get delayed; its progression will be impacted,” added Pai.There is a well-marked low-pressure area over the south-east Bay of Bengal and its neighbourhood. It is likely to concentrate into a depression over the same region during the next 12 hours and further intensify into a cyclonic storm, Amphan, over central parts of south Bay of Bengal by May 16. Due to the development of the cyclone, conditions are likely to become favourable for the advancement of Southwest monsoon into the Andaman Sea, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, and some parts of southeast Bay of Bengal, during next 48 hours, the IMD said in a statement.Past data suggests that there is no association of the date of monsoon advance over the Andaman Sea either with the date of monsoon onset over Kerala or with the seasonal monsoon rainfall over the country, the statement added.Union earth sciences secretary M Rajeevan said there will be some rains in Kerala associated with the development of the cyclonic storm over the Bay of Bengal. “But those will not be monsoon rains. For monsoon advancement, several parameters have to be met including temperature, wind speed, convection north of Australia, and many others.”Rajeevan said the onset of the monsoon over Kerala is not a local phenomenon. “There are many large-scale changes. It has also been seen when there is cyclone development over the Bay of Bengal, the advancement of monsoon is slightly delayed as monsoon winds are pulled there.”When asked if the unusually high westerly activity this year is a result of the climate crisis, Pai said it will be too early to say that. “The reasons have not been studied. It may be a result of natural variability but a high number of western disturbances can impact the flow of the monsoon. We have to see how monsoon progresses after June 5 depending on other factors,” Pai added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-to-be-late-by-4-days-in-kerala/story-JvmnlviZ3ShAM79lapdXiN.html

However, the migrant left behind an apology note for the cycle owner.Mohammad Iqbal stole a cycle from Rarah village of Bharatpur district from the house of Sahab Singh late on Monday night. Singh found the letter while sweeping the veranda of his house. HT managed to get a picture of the note.“Main majdoor hun, majboor bhi. Main aapka gunehgar hu. Aapki cycle lekar ja raha hu.

16-05-2020||India||Govt to create Rs 1 lakh crore Agri-Infrastructure Fund for marginalised farmers: Sitharaman||Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Friday announced the third tranche of the Rs 20 lakh crore  economic stimulus package focussing on agriculture, dairy, animal husbandry and allied activities. The Centre will immediately create a Rs 1 lakh crore Agri-Infrastructure Fund for farm- gate infrastructure for small and medium farmers, most of whom are marginalised.“Financing facility of Rs 1,00,000 crore will be provided for funding Agriculture Infrastructure Projects at farm-gate and aggregation points which will include primary agricultural co-operative societies, farmer producer organizations, agricultural entrepreneurs and start-ups. The fund will be created immediately,” Sitharaman saidThe lack of adequate cold chain and post-harvest management in the vicinity of farm-gate is causing gaps in value chains. The government’s focus has been on short-term crop loans while investment in long-term agriculture infrastructure has often not been enough, the minister indicated.Also Watch | FM Nirmala Sitharaman announces relief package for agriculture sector ALSO READ | Govt supported farmers, fishery owners during Covid-19 lockdown: Nirmala Sitharaman“I have announced 11 measures today, of which 8 are related to strengthening infrastructure, capacities and building better logistics in the country, while the other 3 pertain to governance and administrative reforms,” the finance minister said at the daily news briefing.This is the third phase of announcements by the Union Finance Ministry elaborating on the Centre’s Rs 20 lakh crore economic stimulus package.A couple of days earlier, on Wednesday, Sitharaman had said that over the next few days, the finance ministry would hold daily media briefings to put forth Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of a self-reliant India and share more details on the economic package meant to revive the industry as well as the agricultural sector grappling with a 51-day nationwide lockdown.

16-05-2020||India||HT Exclusive: Nudged by Ajit Doval, Myanmar army hands over 22 northeast insurgents||The Myanmar military handed over a group of 22 northeast insurgents to the Indian government on Friday afternoon. The insurgents, wanted in Manipur and Assam, have been brought back by a special plane, people familiar with the development told Hindustan Times.“This is a huge step for the Myanmar government and a reflection of the deepening ties between the two countries,” a top government official said soon after an aircraft with a planeload of insurgents took off from Myanmar.The plane first made a stopover in Manipur capital Imphal, before heading to Assam’s Guwahati. The insurgents have been handed over to the local police in the two states.Also Read: Packed in Myanmar’s decision to deport 22 insurgents, a sharp message to others“This is the first time that the Myanmar government has acted on India’s request to hand over leaders of the northeast insurgent groups,” a senior national security planner said about the operation driven by National Security Adviser Ajit Doval. This is seen as a result of increasing intelligence and defence cooperation between the two countries from both sides.Among those deported by Myanmar are some senior and long-wanted Indian insurgent leaders such as NDFB (S) self-styled home secretary Rajen Daimary, Capt Sanatomba Ningthoujam of UNLF and Lt Pashuram Laishram of PREPAK (Pro).12 of the 22 insurgents are linked to four insurgent groups in Manipur: UNLF, PREPAK (Pro), KYKL and PLA. The remaining 10 are linked to Assam groups such as NDFB (S) and KLO.PLANELOAD OF INSURGENTSNDFB (S)Rajen Daimary @ Rebgon, self-styled Home SecySelf-styled Capt Sansuma Basumatary @ SarontsaiGagaram Basumatary @ Capt.

The Myanmar army attacked multi-group terror camps at Taga in the north of the country across the Vijaynagar salient in Arunachal Pradesh in the first phase, and decimated Arakan, Nilgiri and Haukyat camps in the second.The 22 insurgents were caught by the Myanmar army in Sagaing Region in these operations.Also Read: In 2019 joint op with Myanmar, Indian army deployed ‘hammer and anvil’ tacticsA national security official said Myanmar’s decision to hand over the insurgents is a huge message to the outfits that Naypyidaw is in sync with New Delhi on dealing with them.Indian officials expect Myanmar’s action to be a deterrent to groups that had assumed the dense forests across the border could insulate them from action. Just as the one created by the United Arab Emirates, once considered a haven for Indian criminals on the run, when it started deporting criminals and terrorists wanted in India.“If Pakistan also acted against terrorists as these two countries do, then there would hardly be any terror group there too,” a senior national security official lamented.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ht-exclusive-myanmar-flushes-out-northeast-insurgents-hands-over-22-to-india/story-x3CcZ88zxPj54l6XtqTj6L.html
16-05-2020||India||Reverse migration, dip in output spell tough times for industries||As thousands of migrant workers return home amid a slump in demand, industries are looking at a difficult road ahead in terms of full resumption of operations even as governments are working on incentives for them to boost production.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday announced a ₹20 lakh crore stimulus package aimed at making India self reliant, with a special focus on economy and industry. The PM said that the package will lead to reforms in land, labour, liquidity and laws, and would provide relief to small and medium enterprises, which employ most of the migrant workers. Resumption of industries could help state governments deal with reverse migration of workers and improve state finances, which have been wrecked by the national lockdown that was first imposed on March 25 and since extended twice. The states have been looking at the Centre for a stimulus package, especially for small and medium industries, which finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman is expected to announce from Wednesday onwards, the PM said.Even though the Centre and the state governments have given several lockdown relaxations, industrial production has not reached the level the state governments had expected. Officials in several states said only about 15%-20% of industries resumed operations, and that, too, with limited capacity, till Monday.Industry leaders urged the government to lift the strict lockdown conditions to kickstart industrial production. They want all shops and offices to open to spur demand, which has plummeted during the lockdown. The small and medium industries are also seeking a financial bailout package. Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray told Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the meeting between the Prime Minister and chief ministers that about 25,000 of the total 125,000 industries in the state had resumed operations, employing about 650,000 workers. “We are expecting the rest of the industrial units will also start their operations in the coming days,” said a senior official from the state industries department. Rajasthan’s additional chief secretary, industries, Subodh Agarwal, said about 12,000 medium and small scale industries had become operational. “These industries are working with a strength of 30%-40% labourers, and less than 50% production capacity. Over two lakh {200,000} labourers are working in these industries,” he said. In northern India’s most industralised state, Punjab, only 16,000, or 6%, of the total of 252,000 industries have resumed operations. These industries include some big manufacturers, such as Hero Cycles in Ludhiana. Vini Mahajan, Punjab’s additional chief secretary, industries, said despite issues related to supply chain, demand and working capital, industries were working to restart operations. Telangana’s industries secretary, Jayesh Ranjan, said nearly 90% of the total of 56,000 functional industries in the state had resumed operations even though most of the factories were running much below their full capacity. Telangana has extended the lockdown till May 29.In neighbouring Andhra Pradesh, about 70% of the industrial units have started operations, up from about 10% on April 20, when industries resumed operation in the lockdown. “Now, industrial activity has picked up in all major industrial estates and SEZs [special economic zones],” an official in the industries department said.In Bihar, only about 3,000 of a total 25,000 industries have started. Government officials said industrial activity will remain poor as the focus of the state was on containing the spread of the pandemic arising from migrant workers returning from different states. In Uttar Pradesh, about 30% of the industries have got permission to resume operations. In Chattisgarh and Jharkhand, not more than 10% of the industries have started operations. “We have small industries, which are totally dependent on workers from outside the state. With workers going back, the industries have failed to resume work,” said a Chhattisgarh government official, who was not willing to be named. An official in Jharkhand said the mining operations have now resumed fully even though other industrial activity was meagre.Industry leader voiceMore than workers leaving, factory owners are concerned about dipping demand and they said the demand will not pick up till the lockdown is fully lifted. Some factory owners in sectors, such as textiles, said they need the government’s financial support to restart their businesses.Kamal Dalmia, chairman of Amritsar’s Focal Point Industries Association, said :”Unless the entire {supply} chain is restored, the units cannot resume operations at full strength.”Vishal Baid, chairman of the Rajasthan chapter of the Confederation of Indian Industry, said although the state government had been as a facilitator, the association was concerned about the absence of workers and poor demand. “Even if we manufacture, there are issues with transportation and there are no buyers as the shops are closed. Unless all shops open and economic activity starts in cities, the demand will not improve,” he said.“To improve demand, the government should allow opening of offices,” said promoter of Bihar based Hebe Ispat, Sanjay Goenka. Deepak Patra, spokesperson for Dalmia Bharat, said the company’s factory was running at full capacity but there were not enough buyers to lift the finished products.Chandrakant Salunkhe, President, Maharashtra Industrial and Economic Development Association (MIEDA), said the industries need a good “financial” package from the government to survive this “unprecedented” dip in demand across sectors. “Whatever non-essential good companies have produced in the last 10 days have no buyers. People are not buying anything except essential goods,” he said.Telangana Industrialists Federation president, K Sudhir Reddy, said the industries were working with 30 to 40% capacity because of restricted timings of operations – only between 7 am and 6 pm --- and shortage of workers and raw material. “We are asking for permission of night shift operations so that the production can go on without interruption,” Reddy said.Pankaj Kumar, national president, Indian Industries Association (IIA), an industry lobby body of the MSME sector in Uttar Pradesh, said, “An NCR pass must be issued for free movement of labourers in the region.” Manmohan Agarwal, who has a chemical plant in the Talkatora Industrial Area in Lucknow, said he cannot open his factory as workers cannot return because of the lockdown. “I was all set to restart plant from Monday, but could not do so due to the labour crisis,” said Agarwal. Some industry owners, such as Vijay Ahuja, a garment manufacturer in Rajasthan, are thinking of closing their businesses. “In the present circumstances, the business is not viable for us. Most of the orders in India and abroad have been put on hold. We will be able to resume operations only if the government provides monetary help and relaxes labour laws,” he said. Raipur-based industry owner, Vishal Sharma, said he cannot resume operations without skilled workers from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, who have gone home, a concern raised by factory owners in Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat. Industry versus state financesSeveral state government functionaries hoped the situation will improve after the lockdown ends on May 17. “More industries will be allowed even in the red zones after May 17. We expect to allow operation of industries in Mumbai, Thane, Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad, the red zones, from next week,” said Maharashtra industries minister Subhash Desai.Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot and Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Monday told the PM that they need to waive restrictions for industrial areas even in red zones to boost economic activity as Covid-19 cases were not coming down. “We are also of the view that after May 17, industries can further be allowed with fewer restrictions after doing a risk analysis in a measured and staggered manner,” Gehlot said.Officials in states such as Maharashtra and Rajasthan said they were working on some financial package for small and medium industries and expected a bigger bailout from the Central government, which has formed a working group to examine stimulus for industry. UP industries minister Satish Mahana said the administration was working on easing problems of industrialists across the state.(With inputs from state bureaus)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/reverse-migration-dip-in-output-spell-tough-times-for-industries/story-oQghUEqzs8bNt2XXwXFdOM.html
16-05-2020||Today's||Implementing Covid-19 stimulus package is bigger challenge | Opinion||On 12 May, Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the nation for the third time on the national lockdown and hinted at an extension of the lockdown in a different form and also announced a mega Rs 20 lakh crore package to kickstart the economy. The central government is expected to soon announce the new guidelines regarding the lockdown 4.0. It is likely that many more economic activities will be permitted to resume. Although the number of coronavirus positive cases have already crossed the 82,000-mark and the number of deaths is nearing 2,700,the government is under tremendous pressure to open up the economy at the earliest.The worst sufferers due to this pandemic have been the daily wage earners and migrant workers. It is very saddening to see thousands and thousands of hungry and poor migrant workers walk on foot or cycle back to their homes hundreds of miles away. Thousands of them are desperately trying to catch any mode of travel such as trucks , tankers, tractors to somehow reach their villages, with the so-called social distancing norms being thrown to the wind. The question is why state governments such as Maharashtra, Telangana, Punjab, Haryana, Andhra Pradesh and Delhi, from where the migrant workers are moving away in droves, are silent about their plight. It was the responsibility of the state governments concerned to not only provide food and shelter to the migrant workers but also transport facilities when they expressed the desire to return to their home district. It is not that they wanted to return to their home free. Every one of them is paying a heavy cost that would be beyond the comprehension of ordinary mortals. The pictures of thousands of our poor migrant workers trying to get back home for the last few weeks has shamed the nation. What these state governments and the state machinery completely lack is empathy and any sense of responsibility towards these helpless people who are one of the most integral parts of our economic machine. There is still time for the state governments to act. They need to tell the district administration in their respective states to provide as many buses as needed and the necessary food packets or financial support to carry all those travelling on foot or otherwise within their district boundaries to their home districts or as near as possible. Just this one step will ensure that within the next two days, every migrant labour will reach his destination safely. Soon after the economy opens up and starts operating full steam, then this compassionate support will act as a positive pull to bring them back to work. All these arrangements are going to cost the state governments some crores of rupees at the most, but the country will be spared the shameful sight of the plight of lakhs and lakhs of these helpless migrant workers -trudging hundreds of kilometres - many literally collapsing by the wayside. Better late than never.The finance minister has so far given the details of the stimulus package, announced by the Prime Minister, in three tranches. The main focus of these announcements have been to support the micro, small and medium enterprises which employ crores of workers. Various measures to support them include Rs 3 lakh crore in additional credit to these enterprises through banks. This is the most crucial support to MSME’s to bring the economy back on track. But the government will have to monitor the progress and implementation of these measures and ensure that the benefits really reach the targeted beneficiaries. The past experience with such measures has not been particularly encouraging. There has been a tendency on part of the banking system to use provisions of the stimulus package and additional funds to first adjust the outstanding amounts due from these enterprises and save non performing assets. This should not be allowed to happen. One way is to obtain regular feedback from beneficiaries and set up a mechanism of monitoring so that the MSMEs get the required working capital support to bring their enterprises back on track. It is hoped that the measures announced by the government will help ease the economic distress and bring crores of workers back into the production process.Many of the elements in the stimulus package announced so far relate to an increase in credit flow to production units and the agriculture sector. They will be able to spur the economy and bring India back on the growth path if, and only if, it is ensured that they are implemented in letter and spirit. This is where our track record is abysmal. The challenge before PM Modi’s government is to reverse this trend, and show that his government has the capacity, drive and skill to achieve the set goals.(VS Pandey is a former IAS officer.
