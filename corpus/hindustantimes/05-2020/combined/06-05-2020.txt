06-05-2020||News||A blueprint to restart the economy| Analysis||The coronavirus disease (Covid-19) is an unprecedented humanitarian crisis. Six weeks of national lockdown have given India the time to make a concerted effort to flatten the curve. Attention is now shifting to reopening the economy while containing the virus. In the six weeks so far, India’s economy has functioned at about half of its full activity level, with over 140 million non-farm workers inactive (of a total of 262 million). This is a cost that India cannot incur repeatedly. Since the infection risk is likely to persist and could increase when the lockdown is lifted, the economy will need to be managed alongside Covid-19, possibly for a prolonged period. In this situation, effective management of lockdowns and restarts will be a critical capability for Indian administrators, along with healthcare and infection tracking capacity. Looking ahead, three considerations may inform a suitable approach for India. First, India’s manufacturing, labour and distribution chains are tightly intertwined and this will need to be taken into account when lifting lockdowns. Take the electronics manufacturing sector, for example. It requires inputs from sectors as diverse as metal working, plastic moulding and paper processing; disallowing any of these could limit production. Second, India’s economic activity is concentrated — 130 districts that are classified by the ministry of health and family welfare as falling in the red zone comprise 40% of India’s GDP; the 352 green zone districts, where most activity is allowed, account for less than a quarter.Third, states may choose to keep red zone districts locked down beyond containment zones in order to minimise the risk of infection spreading, even though the ministry of home affairs (MHA) has allowed them to reopen. Mumbai and Pune, which represent 6% of India’s GDP, are two such examples. Furthermore, varying interpretations of government guidelines by local frontline administrators could confound the issue. In the dynamic environment anticipated, such guidelines may change frequently, needing an agile implementation capability on the ground. We used district-level data on employment for 700+ districts across 19 sectors to analyse economic activity and worker situation. If 27 of the most urbanised red zone districts that also have relatively high infection rates are under lockdown, only 80% of India’s economic activity occurs, and 67 million non-farm workers remain inactive. States such as Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Gujarat and Delhi will each have over four million non-farm workers inactive (see accompanying graphic). This will affect the lives and livelihoods of 195 million people and cost more than $12 billion per quarter in government support.  Therefore, India needs to build a granular, dynamic, locally implemented lockdown and restart management capability. Such a capability would consider several measures beyond the essential ones needed for managing the health situation (for instance, critical care capacity creation, disease tracking and spread prevention). One, clearly moving from a list of permissible activities to a “not-permitted” or “negative” list, which would be easier to understand and implement. This will avoid the risk of critical intermediate industries being disallowed because of a difference in interpretation. Two, reinforcing the principle of locking down only containment zones, not whole districts, in line with MHA guidelines. Administrators, particularly at the district level, are focused on what’s being reported daily —the disease statistics. Providing a 360 degree view that tracks health impact across both lives and livelihoods will enable more informed decision-making.Three, operationalising safe and controlled movement of labour between urban and rural areas, as well as within cities. Four, increasing implementation capacity at the district level through 700+ capable and trained officers deputed to work with district magistrates in each district to help execute locally tailored back-to-work and tailored lockdown plans; supported by cross-functional centres of excellence in each state. This happens in every Indian election. Five, strengthening coordination and communication. Tight coordination among various arms of the government — central departments, states, local administration and regulators — and with stakeholders from industry and commerce is important. A senior-level state-cum-central government Covid-19 forum that meets weekly could be created to interact frequently, sharing cross-functional learnings. This could help deliver clearer communication to stakeholders at all levels.Six, looking ahead and contingency planning since the future is uncertain and the situation will continue to evolve. It will be wise to develop contingency plans at all levels of government based on possible scenarios of disease evolution. India’s economy may likely need to function alongside Covid-19 for a prolonged period. Effective management of lockdowns and restarts will be a critical capability for Indian administrators in this context.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/a-blueprint-to-restart-the-economy-analysis/story-DmtM8I3eugAHbTav2yRHdM.html
06-05-2020||News||Covid-19: Getting Indian citizens back home||Speaking in 2014 to non-resident Indians (NRIs) in New York’s Madison Square Garden, Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi promised that “I will never let you down.” The following year, speaking in Dubai, he thanked Indian workers in the Gulf for their contribution to the motherland: “Even if it rains in India, you open your umbrellas to keep us safe.”The coronavirus disease (Covid-19)-sparked crisis has now turned the tables, with NRIs and other Indian citizens abroad calling on Modi to fulfil his promises and bring them home to safety. Having benefitted at home from his international outreach to the diaspora, the PM will, by now, have realised that the diaspora’s committed support, including political and financial, comes with a price. There are between 10 -20 million Indian citizens abroad. In the Gulf countries alone, 300,000 Indians have registered to return, and an estimated 10,000 have contracted the virus. This poses an unprecedented challenge, one that no other country has faced so far. So, how can their safe passage home be ensured with minimal operational costs and maximum political benefit? The Vande Bharat Mission is yet another attempt by Modi to transform an external crisis into a domestic opportunity. Beginning on Thursday, and coordinated by the ministry of external affairs (MEA), the Vande Bharat Mission is likely to be the largest and most complex repatriation mission ever conducted by India, and possibly worldwide. There will be 64 flights in the first week, for 15,000 people. However, unlike other past operations, including from the Gulf in 1990 or Yemen in 2015, this time the government will only serve as a facilitator. Officials this week emphasised that this is “not an evacuation plan, as it is not government-sponsored” and only “coordinated by MEA and missions worldwide … on commercial basis.” This is a subtle but important clarification that raises several questions. Citizens flying in from North America, for example, will be charged up to ~1 lakh for a one-way flight and have begun to voice their concerns. What will happen to those financially vulnerable, especially in the Gulf, who cannot afford to pay for their travel? Will they be abandoned, subject to the virus, chronic unemployment and xenophobic backlash? And what about the optics of people paying to be taken home by the Indian Navy or the Indian Air Force? The pay-per-use policy is also driven by the need to reduce the financial burden on the government’s coffers, in particular Air India, which is still owed money for past operations. The hundreds, if not thousands, of repatriation flights over the next weeks and months will be a welcome injection of funds into the struggling carrier. And by charging citizens stuck abroad the actual flight cost, the government is also seeking to pre-empt criticism about giving special treatment to the diaspora even as domestic migrants face trying circumstances to move across the country. Besides the commercial aspect of the Vande Bharat Mission, the government also faces five more challenges. First, it will have to make and explain difficult choices about prioritising different countries. The first week, for example, will see a flight from Dhaka but none from Kathmandu. The MEA’s objective logic of sequence will also come under continuous pressure from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and different state governments, given different political agendas, including upcoming state elections. Second, diplomatic missions will also struggle to flesh out the rather ambiguous “compelling” criteria to select who is eligible and prioritised for repatriation. This will rely on the discretion of local diplomats, but is bound to create tension: Foreign citizens are excluded from applying but what will happen, for example, to Indian parents with dependent infants who hold foreign passports? Third, in a struggling Indian economy, the authorities will also have to ensure that returnees are able to reintegrate with minimum disruption. The MEA’s appointment of nodal officers with additional secretary rank to oversee coordination with each state government is welcome. The economy may lose a significant amount of critical remittances, around 2% of GDP, but the return of skilled migrants may also be leveraged as an opportunity for several sectors. Fourth, with the Navy’s deployment to the Maldives, and the Air Force readying its aircraft, there will also be civil-military coordination challenges to ensure successful repatriation. In one of its first practical tests, the newly-created department of military affairs will play an important role in securing sea and air routes for safe passage.Finally, it will be mostly the efforts of Indian diplomats on the ground, serving at the forefront in over 100 countries, which will determine the success of the mission. Every crisis requires all hands on deck, but with less than 1,000 officers, it should be a cause for concern that the Indian Foreign Service has little time left for more strategic tasks in a rapidly changing world order. Even if it all ends well, with PM showing up to claim success and reap political benefits, the Covid-19 crisis will hopefully also make the point that India’s diaspora diplomacy requires more investment. Besides political rallies and cultural festivals, Modi will have to dedicate more resources to upgrading consular services, expanding diplomatic staff and, most important, better training to conduct future operations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/covid-19-getting-indian-citizens-back-home/story-jzYZeUG5KiEq8uneu2mWpL.html
06-05-2020||News||How PM Narendra Modi has led the Covid-19 battle||Prime Minister Narendra Modi is credited with the fact that he was probably the first political leader who understood the importance of social media and leveraged it for the benefit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the 2014 elections. He has continued to use this tool to motivate citizens, while also using radio through “Mann Ki Baat”. I can vouch that it was PM Modi again who could sense the danger of the coronavirus pandemic in December itself, when China was infected. There were, at that time, no cases in India. But the PM, after every cabinet meeting, used to tell us that virus and the infection will not stop in China. He used to emphasise its seriousness, say it will spread all over, and that everyone is unprepared. And, therefore, his emphasis was on how India needs to prepare itself. India started screening incoming international passengers early. Those travellers suspected of being infected were kept in a facility of the ministry of home affairs at Manesar. That was when we realised how grave the situation could turn out to be. From that day, the PM started implementing his plans to prepare India to fight against the pandemic. Here are a few major changes he brought about with his foresight.There was no concept of dedicated Covid-19 hospitals. Today, we have nearly 700 dedicated Covid-19 hospitals with more than 200,000 isolation beds and 15,000 intensive care unit beds.Personal protective equipment (PPE) is vital to save the doctors and staff who treat Covid-19 patients. India had no facility to manufacture them. Initially, major orders were given for imports. Now, we have 39 factories in India manufacturing and stitching PPEs. Over 2.2 million PPE kits have already been distributed.We were not manufacturing masks, leave alone N95. But six million masks have already been distributed. While many new factories have started working on N95 masks, small units have started preparing and stitching home-made masks.We had only one lab to test. That was in Pune. Our testing capacity was just 4,000 per day. Now there are nearly 300 labs to conduct Covid-19 tests and give results. Now we can conduct 80,000-plus tests a day.Initially, there were only around 8,400 ventilators. With initial orders, we now have nearly 30,000 ventilators. Indian manufacturers have started producing ventilators. We expect around 30,000 ventilators to be produced domestically.Even as he led the preparations, PM Modi, simultaneously, remained connected with the world, talked to various leaders, and shared experiences, learning from each other and implementing what he found useful and appropriate for the Indian context.PM Modi also recognised the impact of the lockdown. Therefore, he declared a huge package of Rs 1.7 lakh crore to protect the poor. India has the biggest food security programme in the world under which 800 million people are given five kg of wheat/rice at Rs 2/3 a kg. For April, May and June, the PM decided to give 15 kg rice/wheat plus three kg dal free of cost, per person. This took care of basic rations for all vulnerable Indian households.Around 200 million women from low-income groups were provided support, through the direct benefit transfer scheme of Rs 500 per month for three months in their Jan Dhan accounts. Further, under the PM-Kisan scheme, Rs 2,000 was transferred to 84 million farmers; 80 million beneficiaries of Ujwala LPG scheme were offered three cylinders free of cost. The PM also offered the facility of withdrawal from the provident funds and close to a million workers have withdrawn nearly Rs 36 crore.The PM also provided help to small businesses and workers by promising that the provident fund contribution of the owner and worker will be deposited by the government for three months. The Reserve Bank of India has also released liquidity of Rs 4 lakh crore through various measures in repo rates. The middle class was given the facility for deferment of EMIs and other mandatory submissions. The Centre gave Rs 15,000 crore for dedicated treatment of Covid-19 and released Rs 11,000 crore as State Disaster Relief Fund (SDRF). In addition, Rs 31,000 crore was also released to help construction workers and all states were asked to distribute this at the earliest.The PM also ensured the full-scale operation of agricultural activities, from the farm to the market by facilitating faster movement, more sowing, and money being paid to the farmers at the earliest. This ensured that the agricultural economy started working normally.A national lockdown is a massive decision. It can never be successful until people participate voluntarily. The PM has maintained a continued dialogue with the people, with even the poorest of the poor convinced that the PM is working for them and cares. This is why he could prepare them psychologically for the long lockdown, suspension of activities and the resultant hardship. The people’s curfew and his call to applaud health workers and frontline workers helped motivate people to fight Covid-19 and instill discipline in them.The PM also gave simple four steps to remain safe — put on a mask, wash hands regularly, keep social distancing, and stay at home. Citizens have largely abided by this.All of this shows that PM Modi planned in advance, planned in detail, practised meticulously, communicated effectively, and kept the world in the loop. India has, therefore, succeeded in managing the coronavirus crisis better than many other advanced economies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/how-pm-narendra-modi-has-led-the-covid-19-battle/story-78clA27sNmrap5hfXuKaIP.html
06-05-2020||News||To counter the Covid-19 pandemic, bring more poor into the LPG net||One of the most important components of the government’s coronavirus disease (Covid-19) relief package is free LPG for three months for nearly 500 million people. As the national system of LPG distribution is reasonably well-functioning, it is an efficient way to provide economic support to the poor. With uncertainty all around us, ensuring free LPG takes at least one important burden off people’s plates.There are, however, some concerns. The programme is focused on its recent customer base – about 83 million – created by the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana. It may be an efficient way to reach the poor, but it, unfortunately, leaves out a number of equally deserving groups of the poor. To reach the left-out sections, India needs additional measures.A secure and continuous supply of LPG is another concern. It is the only fuel in the country with stable demand. The consumption of other major fuels – gasoline, diesel, CNG, or coal – is drastically down due to the lockdown. Other energy-intensive activities involving the use of cars, buses, trains, and planes are at much lower levels. Due to the complete lockdown, more people are cooking at home, further pushing up the LPG demand.LPG is an odd fuel in that, unlike oil, it’s not searched for directly. There are no LPG wells anywhere. It is, in fact, a secondary product of the oil and gas production, which, owing to low demand, threaten the availability of LPG. To ensure its supplies, the government has reached out to natural gas producers in the Persian Gulf. But with global gas and oil production suppressed, it may require more effort.What perhaps is not so well-understood and appreciated is that ensuring the use of LPG among the poor is actually a direct health benefit measure. Air pollution exposure from biomass cooking fires increases the risk and severity of infection, a harmful situation particularly during the Covid-19 spread.It is well-established that air pollution exposure increases the risk of respiratory diseases, including infectious ones like flu or pneumonia. This is not because pollution contains pathogens – the virus in this case – but because it decreases the effectiveness of the human immune system.Recent research shows that those exposed to air pollution are more susceptible to Covid-19. It’s also true for smokers whose immune system is further weakened by smoke. Outdoor air pollution in India, among the worst in the world, and the use of fossil fuels such as coal, has dropped drastically during the lockdown. This is good for health, a partial counterbalance to the terrible disruption of life brought about by the economic disruption. Sending people to their villages and towns during the lockdown, however, may expose them to smoke from cooking fires if they are still using biomass fuel. It will cause extra pollution exposures and enhance the risk of Covid-19 by counteracting the benefit from lower ambient pollution exposure. Since the household use of biomass is responsible for a substantial portion of ambient pollution nationally, some of the health benefits accrued due to low consumption of fossil fuel will also be lost.It’s praiseworthy that India has convinced most people to stay in their homes that have cleaner air owing to the use of LPG. But it may also want to find ways to ensure gas supply for those who are left out to help keep homes clean and safe for everyone.Kirk R Smith is director, Collaborative Clean Air Policy Centre, New Delhi, and professor, School of Public Health, University of California, BerkeleyThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/to-counter-the-covid-19-pandemic-bring-more-poor-into-the-lpg-net/story-drzPH8Jk26uRXsSvaqfz2J.html
06-05-2020||Mumbai||Is BMC ready to handle a surge in Covid-19 cases?||With 10,714 cases, 412 deaths, 2,083 containment zones, and 41 days of lockdown, authorities have a mixed take on how bad the Covid-19 crisis can get for Mumbai. One thing they are certain about, however, a need to prepare the city’s health infrastructure to handle the worst-case scenario – 75,000 cases projected by May end.“The way to deal with this situation is to be prepared. We should not be taken by surprise at a later date and caught scrambling for resources. Mumbai is better off over-estimating the extent of the spread of Covid-19. To be prepared, we need hospital and quarantine beds to match our projected figures. We need more doctors and nurses to attend to patients being treated at hospitals, and personal protective equipment (PPE) for our frontline staff,” said a senior civic official.As the number of positive cases begins to rise, surveillance through fever clinics will help identify positive patients at a local level. “Fever clinics target the right group of people who are more susceptible to catching the virus; those who live in containment zones or hotspots. The clinics cater to random people from within this group who come forward because they show symptoms, or are unidentified contacts of positive patients,” said the official. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has so far conducted 255 fever clinics through which 11,591 people have been screen and 238 positive cases have been identified.As the number of cases rises rapidly, BMC is tasked with identifying more beds for symptomatic patients, those with co-morbidities, and serious cases. They also need to find isolation units for asymptomatic patients who do not need constant medical care.Municipal commissioner Praveen Pardeshi had earlier told Hindustan Times, “We have decided to move asymptomatic patients to Covid care centres so that the hospital beds they utilise can be made available for patients who need urgent and constant medical attention.”As approximately 60% of the total cases are asymptomatic, the city needs to ramp up the number of beds at Covid care centres as well at hospitals0. At present, there are 7,500 hospital beds ready and another 5,000 have been identified at private hospitals. They are being equipped with oxygen points. In addition, 750 intensive care unit (ICU) beds are available.BMC is also preparing Mumbai’s large open spaces, playgrounds, and sports complexes to convert them to temporary quarantine centres (CCCs). Mahalaxmi Racecourse is set to house 200 isolation beds in its parking lot; Mahim Nature Park will have 600 beds; Richardson and Cruddas factory near JJ Hospital will have 200 beds, and Bandra-Kurla Complex’s exhibition grounds will house 500 beds. Bhabha Atomic Research Centre’s (BARC) DAE Convention Centre at Chembur and Nehru Science Centre, Andheri Sports Complex, along with 350 municipal schools will also be used for CCCs. The National Sports Club of India (NCSI) dome at Worli and BKC grounds are set to get oxygen points for the beds there.BMC has identified 25,000 isolation beds at hotels, hostels, marriage halls, and sports complexes. Also, another 35,000 bed-spaces have been identified in 350 municipal schools, and 20,000 beds can be available in ‘jumbo facilities’ such as gymkhanas.Risk contacts of Covid-positive patients, who were earlier being moved to CCCs are now being asked to quarantine themselves at home, unless they live in small houses shared by more family members, or have community toilets.The civic body is looking to hire over 1,000 doctors, nurses, and supporting medical staff on a contractual basis for three months. It also plans to hire post-graduate students from private medical colleges to monitor patients at CCC centres, which do not need specialised doctors.However, experts believe the preparations may not be adequate considering the speed at which the pandemic is spreading. Further, the city’s residents need to understand their role in countering the outbreak.Dr Sanjay Pattiwar, public health consultant said, “We are talking about 10,000 cases, but there are going to be many more. The key is for people to not be afraid of the coronavirus, or community quarantine centres, and come forward to report their symptoms. Lockdown is the key to containing the virus, but we will have to bank on herd immunity to be able to deal with this situation. There needs to be more awareness among people about personal hygiene, community hygiene, and social distancing. Even today, people are violating lockdown rules. I may test negative today, but I may become positive a week later. How many times will the government conduct Covid tests on me in such a scenario?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/is-bmc-ready-to-handle-a-surge-in-covid-19-cases/story-dQeYscYJxzoUc1GYyx5zUK.html

Police said that before the meeting was held, an announcement was made from the loudspeaker of a gurdwara nearby, asking people to move their vehicles parked inside the park, to create space for the gathering. “After a tip off, a police team wearing PPE kits entered the zone and arrested six persons—Sushil Kumar, Partap Singh, Surinder Singh, Hakam Singh, Harsh and Surjit Singh— from the spot. When we entered the meeting was underway,” according to a police statement. Other at the meeting fled the spot. The arrested persons told police they had held a meeting because they were feeling trapped by barricades installed at the boundaries as well as within their sector. They said they wanted to go back to work and earn their livelihood. On a complaint given by Sat Pal, the executive magistrate of the containment zone, the accused were booked under Sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life), 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) of Indian Penal Code (IPC) at the Industrial Area police station.The six persons arrested were later released on bail, while attempts are being made to ascertain the identities of the remaining accused, the police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/6-arrested-30-booked-for-holding-meeting-in-containment-zone-in-chandigarh/story-hkjKMhXGyeFTjhy03bZ1tI.html
06-05-2020||Mumbai||Credit points for doctors working with Covid patients||To attract more doctors to participate in the treatment of Covid-19 patients, the Maharashtra Medical Council (MMC) has decided to award credit points to those engaged in the frontline work, to help them renew their medical licence.Every five years, doctors need to renew their licences to practice. As per the norms, they need to earn 30 credit points by attending conferences and seminars. Those who fail to score the 30 points are not eligible to renew their licence and cannot practice medicine.“Registered medical practitioners are at the forefront of the war against the coronavirus and not only are they facing the daunting task of handling patients, they are also fighting to keep their own worries and emotional stress at bay. They are selfless, hardworking and diligent individuals who save lives on a daily basis,” reads the MMC circular issued on April 29.To encourage doctors to actively participate in the struggle against Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, the MMC will grant two credit points per day up to a maximum of 10, to doctors. They have divided the doctors into three categories — those serving in government hospitals or institutions; doctors working in private hospitals for treatment of Covid patients, and medical practitioners participating in fever, community, mobile clinics primarily for the diagnosis of patients.“By serving the nation during the time of the pandemic, doctors can gain the points which will help them to renew their medical licences. This is a form of a reward for the Covid frontliners. We have already extended the certificate renewal time for doctors by three months,” said Dr Shivkumar Utture, president of MMC.The medical council said it has taken this decision to encourage doctors to come forward for the treatment of Covid patients. Doctors with specialisation in forensic science, psychiatry, community medicine, orthopaedics among others, may not be directly involved in the treatment of Covid patients but can help in screening patients and providing basic care to asymptomatic patients at Covid care centres. Doctors can claim their Covid certificate from deans, district collectors, corporation health officers, or civil surgeons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/credit-points-for-doctors-working-with-covid-patients/story-P3Nc6fWpf7SfEulWsvt6vI.html

06-05-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: A poet’s heart gets a pacemaker||The Walled City of Old Delhi was home to great poet Ghalib. More than a century after his death, the historic quarter continues to nurture a few men (and, in one instance at least, a woman) so passionate about poetry that they might as well believe that poems are enough to cure any ailment.One such sophisticate is poet Ameer Dehlvi—tall, handsome and very frail. He is 90, and one is naturally inclined to worry for him in the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Indeed, it has proved to be particularly fatal to the elderly. One thing to fear in particular: getting some other illness that might necessitate to leave the sanctuary of home for a visit to the hospital, and risking one’s safety over the expedition.This is exactly what happened to Mr Dehlvi.“Late last month Ameer abba suffered a complete heart block, a disturbance in the rhythm of the heart,” explained his nephew Suhail Qureshi, an oncologist, in a phone text. He explains that the poet had to be transported to the Holy Family hospital for emergency surgery. A permanent pacemaker was inserted into his chest. “That hospital is 13 kilometres from home but the roads were empty because of the lockdown, and we were able to reach in 20 minutes.”The surgery lasted for one hour. All went well during Mr Dehlvi’s three-day stay in the hospital, except that his loud chatty voice would often startle the fellow patients. Nevertheless, the poet is so charming and affectionate that to nobody’s surprise he won many hearts — no pun intended here. He would cheer up everybody in the ICU and ended up becoming friends with other patients as well as with members of the nursing staff.Now Mr Dehlvi is back to the isolation of his Chawri Bazar house. An old-fashioned dwelling with a courtyard in the middle, it harbours four generations of Mr Dehlvi’s family, numbering to more than 30 people. He is the second eldest among six brothers. His wife lies buried in distant Kashmir.In the BC (Before Corona) era, Mr Dehlvi would spend his days in the family-run hotel near Jama Masjid, where he could be seen intently gazing upon the crowd from the hotel balcony. He would also listen to songs on his old radio, or read poetry, if not write a ghazal or two himself.The prolonged lockdown might have made him yearn for the street life, but the heightened frailty after a major health scare makes him more inclined to rest at home. He still reads Urdu newspapers, and often talks to friends on phone. Many a times, nephew Suhail says, “Ameer abba” can be heard reciting verses from the Qur’an while in bed (a Hafiz, he can read the entire book from memory). “This being the month of Ramzan, Ameer abba prays for everyone’s well-being and often thanks God for giving him a fresh lease of life,” says Suhail.One thing Mr Dehlvi is particularly disconcerted about is that he hasn’t been able to get his beard trimmed. A nephew did try to shape it with a trimmer but the poet is used to the able hands of local barber Shakeel. And there is no knowing of when the barbers will be allowed to work again.One evening, the gracious poet agrees to a brief interview on WhatsApp video with this reporter. He is sitting in his bedroom, dressed in white. Soon after resuming the major updates of his new life with a pacemaker, Mr Dehlvi breaks into the impromptu recitation of a shayari he wrote recently. His face is suddenly animated with intense feelings, and glows with hints of good health. Watching and hearing him gives a sense of beauty and relief and privilege.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-a-poet-s-heart-gets-a-pacemaker/story-ZAj4nvAiiYL3SKLCXQw20O.html
06-05-2020||City||Civic bodies in MMR stay entry ban order after drawing flak||With Mumbai having more than two-third of the state’s Covid-19 cases and more than 2,000 containment zones, other districts and municipal corporations are cautious of allowing entry to those coming from Mumbai. Two municipal corporations and two municipal councils in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) on Tuesday passed orders sealing the boundaries of their cities and towns for those working in Mumbai. After harsh reactions from employees working in the essential and emergency services, the orders have been stayed for the time being. “We discussed this issue after the state cabinet meeting today, and it has been decided to stay the order. We are trying to make alternative arrangements for the staff staying in other municipal corporations,” said Aslam Shaikh, guardian minister of Mumbai city.The Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) stayed the order on Wednesday, citing lengthy process to prepare a list of those who work in Mumbai.“Making a list of people travelling regularly for work and making provision for accommodation will take time, so we have decided to stay the order,” said Vijay Suryavanshi, KDMC commissioner.The Ulhasnagar Municipal Corporation and Kulgaon Badlapur Municipal Council have also stayed the decision to stop entry for those travelling to Mumbai for essential services. According to officials from the health department, 70% of the 42 cases in Badlapur have contracted the virus at their workplace in Mumbai. “The cases in Solapur, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg have been found to be linked to those who have travelled to Mumbai or Pune. The district authorities do not approve applications for inter-state travel from Mumbai,” said an official from Mantralaya. Many villages have barred entry to those coming from Mumbai. “In one of the villages in our district, a girl and her family, who had come from Mumbai, were not allowed to attend the funeral of her relative,” said an official from the collector’s office. Although the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) has not issued any order to bar entry, it has made a list of 1,100 residents who travel to Mumbai for work every day and submitted it to BMC this week, requesting it to make arrangements for their accommodation in Mumbai.TMC said it is looking at options to curb the spread.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/civic-bodies-in-mmr-stay-entry-ban-order-after-drawing-flak/story-1qjnST80Ih4xNoOXhD7rGL.html

The flights were to commence operations from Thursday, but they will now start from Friday. The aviation ministry had on Tuesday announced that AI would be operating 64 special flights between May 7 and May 13 to fly back Indians stranded in 12 countries. However, the process has been delayed by a day after certain countries made it mandatory for the operating crew to have health certificates showing that they have not contracted Covid-19. “Air India has adhered to the guidelines issued on Tuesday which makes it mandatory for the cockpit/cabin crew to undergo Covid-19 test as required by the destination countries,” said a senior Air India official. “We wouldn’t like to make any comment on this as all details regarding this are being disseminated by appropriate authorities in the Ministries concerned,” said the airline spokesperson.According to the revised schedule, sources said, Air India’s first flight AI 380, a dreamliner B787, will take off for Singapore at 11.15pm from Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGI) on Thursday.

06-05-2020||Mumbai||769 Covid-19 cases: Mumbai sees highest single-day jump||The city crossed the 10,000 mark for Covid-19 cases, with 769 cases – highest single-day count – bringing its total to 10,714. The toll crossed the 400 mark, with 25 deaths pushing the number to 412, according to the state health department data.On April 25, Mumbai had 5,049 positive cases with 191 deaths, which increased to 7,812 cases and 295 deaths on May 1 to crossing the 10,000 mark on Wednesday. The areas that have the highest number of cases include Worli, Prabhadevi, Dharavi, Byculla, Mazagaon, Malabar Hill, Dadar and Mahim. Of them, Worli and Prabhadevi that fall under the G-South Ward of Mumbai are inching towards 1,000 cases, followed by Dharavi (G-North ward), which has more than 650 cases. At least 12,000 citizens have been screened at more than 250 fever clinics, of which 250 have tested positive.The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has maintained that it expects around 75,000 cases by the end of the month. By this projection, the daily average number of cases in the city would be 2,000. However, the current daily average for the past 10 days is 450 cases. While the BMC said the cases are not going up drastically, the curve is not showing any downward movement either.The civic body also said the daily testing capacity in the city will increase to 10,000 in the coming two weeks, from the current 6,000 tests. In Mumbai, 1 lakh tests have been conducted so far, with the daily figure at 4,000.Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, BMC, said, “The doubling rate of Mumbai (rate at which the positive cases double) is still the same at 10 days. We had projected 75,000 cases by the end of this month, but it does not necessarily mean that we will have that many cases. We have readied beds for 60,000 patients. One cannot say whether the current number is the peak or whether the decline has started. The cases are definitely rising, but the rise is steady. The curve is not showing any downward trend, which means we have to be ready to handle the number of cases that we have projected.”As a precaution, municipal commissioner Praveen Pardeshi on Tuesday ordered closure of non-essential and liquor shops. In a circular, Pardeshi pointed out: “It has been observed that number of positive cases in the city of Mumbai has been rising and the downward trend is yet to set in and gathering of crowds in large numbers without following social distancing will be detrimental to the control of spread of virus and the advantages of the lock-down will be lost...”According to BMC officials, they have been conducting tests to 50 per cent of their capacity (4,000 of the capacity of 6,000) daily. “The capacity always has to be more than the total requirement. We have around 12 labs in the city now, and the number will increase to 15 labs, to increase the testing capacity to 10,000… In a way, cases and tests are related, but not directly. Earlier, we had to conduct many tests, but now with change in our strategy and the guidelines, we have to conduct optimal number of tests.”According to the data of Medical Education and Drugs Department of Maharashtra, Mumbai has a recovery rate of 16% – 1,686 of the total 9,945 cases have recovered, as of Tuesday.Dr Sanjay Pattiwar, a public health consultant, said, “Increasing testing capacity is needed, but we need to have community quarantining for suspected citizens. Mere increasing tests will not help us detect more cases.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/769-covid-19-cases-mumbai-sees-highest-single-day-jump/story-IQIJbkUNXTiE2sMpPRXhBK.html
06-05-2020||Mumbai||Analysis by TIFR shows dip in infection rate since April 11||An analysis by Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) shows Covid-19’s rate of infection has decreased from April 11 onwards. TIFR’s findings indicate one Covid-positive individual in Mumbai is likely to have infected two people.Based on a susceptible-exposed-infected-recovery (SEIR) statistical model, TIFR’s analysis found that from April 11 till date, the R0 (R nought) measure for Covid-19 was at 2.2. R0, also known as the reproduction number, is a measure of how many people may be infected by one patient. On April 29, HT had reported that between March 31 and April 14, Covid-19’s reproduction number in Mumbai was around R3.4. Professor Sourendu Gupta of TIFR said the numbers suggest the lockdown has been effective in Mumbai, which recorded its highest single-day spike on Wednesday. The total number of positive cases in Mumbai is now 10,714. TIFR’s analysis shows that the doubling time of fatality and infection rates has decreased in the range of seven to nine days. Between March 31 and April 14, the doubling time for infection and fatality rates were estimated to be from 5.3 to 5.7 days.“For a city like Mumbai with a huge population, 10,000 is not a large number if one just thinks of it as an infection. But one has to think about the circumstances around it in terms of how many have died or need medical help,” said Gupta. “Unless, the infection rates are brought down further, the healthcare infrastructure will be overwhelmed,” he added.Dr Abhay Chowdhary, former director of Haffkine Institute of Research and Training, Parel, who was not involved in TIFR’s analysis, said, “Testing has definitely increased, but the doubling rate of infection shows that the curve is still slowly moving upwards.”Stating that contract tracing should continue in Mumbai and testing should be made more broadly available, Gautam Menon, professor of biology and physics at Ashoka University, who was not involved with the study, said the lockdown has served to stem the rapid increase in the numbers of infections in Mumbai. “However, as long as the numbers of new cases continue to increase, the epidemic will restart unless steps to cut the chain of transmission continue after the lockdown,” said Menon, also adjunct faculty at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research. “To control the epidemic citizens should voluntarily accept the need for physical distancing, wearing masks, and workplaces adopting staggered working hours wherever possible.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/analysis-by-tifr-shows-dip-in-infection-rate-since-april-11/story-3vZPfCZsEsFDbBOZfEeQVI.html

More than 10,000 labourers have been sent back till now. Pranaya Ashok, DCP (ops) and spokesperson for the Mumbai Police, confirmed the development and said, “Migrants will have to be a bit more patient as the government is trying their best to send them back home as soon as possible. It’s a lengthy process.” Despite the assurances, labourers are getting desperate and are trying to leave Mumbai without following the government’s laid down procedure. Between Monday and Wednesday, Sakinaka police registered five cases wherein 222 labourers from Uttar Pradesh were caught hiding inside trucks and tempos to go to their hometowns. “The drivers and owners of these vehicles have been booked while labourers were sent to shelters,” said Kishor Sawant, senior inspector of Sakinaka police station. Nishith Mishra, additional commissioner of police, south region, said, “The police are awaiting response from nodal officers of the respective states. The possible delay could be because the receiving states are giving priority to those states which have more labourers from their state. We will wait for our turn to send the labourers.” Additional commissioner of police, central region, Veeresh Prabhu said, “We have got approval from Bihar, but are awaiting approval from other states. We have a total of 40,000 migrant labourers in our region.” 47 labourers head home to take up farmingA total of 47 migrants from Gujarat and Rajasthan, who were working in garment units in Dharavi, were sent back to their hometowns in two sanitised buses from Dharavi on Wednesday. “Instead of being jobless and having no source of income in Mumbai, the migrants said they will take up farming in their villages,” said Vilas Gangawane, senior inspector, Shahunagar police station. Duo arrested for stealing liquor The Mumbai Police’s crime branch unit 10 on Wednesday arrested two men for breaking into a wine shop in Powai on April 19 and stealing liquor bottles and cash worth ₹8.60 lakh.

06-05-2020||Mumbai||Group of 10 college students in Dharavi provide ration to needy||With many areas in Dharavi sealed due to the increasing number of Covid-19 cases every day, managing two square meals has become an arduous task for residents. To ensure nobody goes hungry, a group of 10 college students from Rajiv Gandhi Nagar, a neighbourhood in the slum, are providing ration to the inhabitants.There were 665 Covid-positive cases in Dharavi till Tuesday. ‘Dharavi Boys’ has been helping families with food since last month. They initially pooled money from their own pockets to support some residents. Over the last few days, they were able to support over 100 people from the donations they received. “More than the disease, people here are worried about having to go to bed without food. Most of them are daily wage earners who haven’t gone to work for long and have no money to buy food. We thought of doing something for the people in our locality and hence decided to pool some resources,” said 24-year-old Vikas Jaiswar, who has recently passed his Bachelors in Engineering (BE) from a Navi Mumbai college. As the funds pooled in were not enough to feed families in the slums which house nearly 10 lakh people, the group decided to crowdsource money online. “We have created a Twitter handle and a donation link on ketto (a fundraising site) hoping to get some funds,” said Stanley Anto, a social worker who helped the students set up a social media page. With cases increasing daily, the boys are also facing several difficulties in their work. “A couple from our locality who was providing similar help got infected and is in a hospital. We are scared to go out but we take adequate precautions and use masks, sanitisers and gloves,” Jaiswar added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/group-of-10-college-students-in-dharavi-provide-ration-to-needy/story-40Iy9wFKgkoIqt7IAIPEDP.html

This comes a day after the Bombay high court (HC) asked the state government if there was any Covid-19 infection in Arthur Road jail while hearing a plea filed by Hemant Bhatt, an accused in ₹13,500-crore fraud at the Punjab National Bank, who sought interim bail in view of the pandemic.The 47-year-old inmate tested positive for the virus after he suffered a paralytic attack on May 2, following fever since April 30, and was admitted to JJ Hospital. The undertrial was in the jail since April 2019 and was facing charges under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substance Act. Deepak Pandey, inspector general of the prison, confirmed the development. According to JJ Hospital records, the patient was admitted at 1.55pm on May 2. A swab test was taken and his results came positive on May 5, said police sources.“A team of officials from JJ Hospital visited Arthur Road jail and took swabs of 150 people including inmates and jail staff. The reports are expected on Thursday,” said Pandey.The development was a surprise to the jail authorities as no new prisoners were admitted into the prison since the first week of April to avoid overcrowding in the prison. Arthur Road prison, which has a capacity to house 800 prisoners, currently has about 2,700 prisoners.The jail authorities have started the containment process, said a police officer. “The incident comes as a surprise to many as lockdown rules were being strictly followed by the staff who stay within the premises. The possibility of the disease entering the prison through BMC cleaning staff, sanitisation workers, or essential services workers cannot be ruled out,” added the officer.Meanwhile, two jail staff, who were staying at a guest house near Byculla jail, tested positive on Tuesday. The jail staff had taken an inmate to JJ Hospital. “The two jail staff have tested positive and have been quarantined. Once a staff member goes out of the jail premises, we do not let them in without a medical certificate. We are taking all safety measures,” said Pandey.(With input from Kanchan Chaudhari)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/undertrial-in-arthur-road-prison-tests-positive-for-covid-19-first-case-in-state-jails/story-mhvUT4OraqCSh1iLLP6oyH.html
06-05-2020||Mumbai||Migrants’ issue in cabinet meet: 10,000 ST buses to ply migrants||As the number of Covid-19 cases continues to rise, the Maharashtra government is preparing to send a large number of migrant workers from Mumbai back to their hometowns in states like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh in the coming days. Special trains will be arranged to send them back to their respective states. The Uttar Pradesh government, which was not keen to take back its people earlier, has now agreed to the same, officials said.However, two states – Karnataka and West Bengal – have refused to take back migrants as of now.The issue was discussed in a state cabinet meeting held on Wednesday during which ministers expressed concerns over the large number of migrant workers staying in Mumbai. They claimed this was hampering the state’s efforts to curb the coronavirus outbreak.“When Mumbai is experiencing a rapid rise in Covid-19 cases, migrant workers are making long queues in every part of the city to get health certificates necessary to go back to their hometowns. This has made our job to control the cases really difficult,” said a senior minister, on condition of anonymity.“We are in touch with all the states and they have agreed to take back their workers except Karnataka and West Bengal. Now, Uttar Pradesh has also agreed to take them back. They have also agreed to group certificates for the migrant workers which will speed up the entire process. Now, trains will be arranged from Mumbai and Pune to send these workers soon,” said a senior official.Over 50,000 migrant workers have been sent to their respective states from Maharashtra till Wednesday. Some, 25 trains have left for their destinations from various parts of the state so far.The Central government has decided to run 100 special trains to ferry migrant workers to their native places. State relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar announced plans to ply 10,000 state transport buses to various districts to transport labourers stranded across the state. He said that the buses will ply at 50% capacity to maintain social distancing. “The government will bear the charges of the fare for which the relief and rehabilitation department has earmarked ₹20 crore,” Wadettiwar said.(Inputs from Surendra P Gangan)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/migrants-issue-in-cabinet-meet-10-000-st-buses-to-ply-migrants/story-jXujimPYUou0TLfjJOyrSP.html

Apart from this, police force, along with around 100 Anti-Riot Police personnel, were deployed near the railway station to maintain law and order.Employees of the MC, roadways and health department were tasked with conducting medical screening and transporting the passengers from pick-up points to ISBT to railway station starting 5am. They also checked the identity cards of the passengers and provided them tickets.Railways’ employees , including 82 ticket checking staff and over 100 railway police personnel, manned the entry gates of the station and train coaches, while also checking the passengers’ tickets and medical certificates before helping them board the trains.“We never think how long we have to work or how many hours we will get to rest. We work as per the orders from our seniors,” a railway employee said, wishing anonymity.Meanwhile, the administration arranged over 2,000 packets of food, each including rice, three chapattis, dal and vegetables, which were distributed among the migrants on the trains.Assistant commissioner of police Gurdev Singh said the police and the administration had been on their toes since March 22. “From managing movement of migrants to maintaining the law and order in the city and serving langar among the needy to providing essential supplies at the doorsteps, the police force has been giving it their all,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/shramik-trains-from-ludhiana-all-hands-on-deck-six-hours-of-overnight-planning/story-lswngPaRmVDv6LmtKPtepM.html
06-05-2020||Mumbai||City slums prove to be biggest challenge in tackling Covid-19 battle||As Mumbai crosses the 10,000 coronavirus cases mark on Wednesday, it is clear that stemming the spread of the pandemic in the city’s slums and congested areas is turning to be one of biggest challenges for the state and city administration.Local representatives and ground-level NGO workers point out that the plight of the slum dwellers is worsening due to lapses in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) handling to contain the virus. They have called for a more differentiated approach in every ward or slum cluster facing the outbreak, pointing out that the conditions of the people living in these areas are vastly different from not just middle-class colonies but also each other.An analysis of the total deaths in the city by the BMC so far also shows that 60% of deaths have been reported from slums.Besides, Dharavi, the largest slum in the country, slum clusters in Govandi, Bandra East, Kurla West, Malad, Borivli and major slum clusters in Mulund are a cause of worry for the city administration.Arun Kumar, CEO of Apnalaya, a non-government organisation that works in M east ward including areas of Govandi, Cheetah Camp, Deonar said, “There is an urgent need to recognise that different pockets or wards of the city are differently equipped to handle the challenges thrown up by the pandemic. Any ward with over 55% of its population working as casual workers living in barely 15x10 sq ft houses would face challenges concerning ‘social’ distancing and lockdown.’’Giving an example he added, “In Shivaji Nagar, a slum cluster of over 4.37 lakh population, about 35% of households don’t have ration cards. What sense would relief measures like free ration distribution make to people who can’t access it? This is an area where over 11% of people struggle with food security during normal times. How would they be navigating these days when they can’t go out to work and earn?” The M east ward, for instance, is among the largest wards in the city and nearly 77% of its population lives in slums. But the area is serviced by only two hospitals that are already overburdened by Covid-19 cases. Currently, this ward has recorded 460 cases and 51 deaths so far.Dharavi, the 240-hectare slum sprawl, which has around 8.50 lakh citizens and a population density of 66,0000 per sq km, has reported 665 cases and 20 deaths so far. Experts believe this may just be the tip of the ice-berg given that social distancing is impossible here.Kiran Dighavkar, assistant municipal commissioner of G north ward (Dharavi-Dadar), said, “One of the major challenges in Dharavi is the density of the population. There are 19, 000 stranded workers who are being provided food by the BMC and they have to step out to collect food parcels. Another major problem is common toilets in the majority of the slum pockets. The common toilets are sanitised once or twice a day but the toilets are used by the people regularly. The only solution we are looking at here is isolating a maximum number of people and increasing our isolation capacities.”Akhtar Qureshi, local corporator from Govandi, said, “There are not enough measures being taken by the BMC for containing the virus in slums of Govandi. Daily, I have been coming across cases of patients running from pillar to post for treatment or to even get a bed in a hospital. The slums of Govandi area are going through a major health crisis. These issues will not be solved just by sanitising the area or implementing stricter lockdown measures.”Considering that home quarantine is barely a viable option for people living in slums, the BMC has hired rooms from local lodge owners and turned sports complexes and schools into Covid-19 care facilities to increase their capacity. A civic official confirmed that M east ward has more than 1200 quarantine beds where nearly 400 people have been shifted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/city-slums-prove-to-be-biggest-challenge-in-tackling-covid-19-battle/story-dhsK5oOts1wBuoGe4UsvJL.html

The police said all 22 persons, including five accused of molesting nurses of MMG Hospital, are now lodged at a temporary jail at Adyatmik Inter College in Dasna.The temporary jails had come up on the directions of the state government and were meant for people who are foreign nationals, linked to Islamic missionary group Tablighi Jamaat , and for those suspected to be involved in attacking police or health care workers, officials of the UP prisons department has said.“The Ghaziabad police has lodged 24 cases under the Epidemic Act and arrested 94 persons and seven cases were lodged under the provisions of the Disaster Management Act and 54 were arrested. Of them, 17 were in quarantine and seven were from Nepal while 10 others were from Indonesia.

All 22 persons were produced before a court and are now being transferred to the temporary jail,” the SSP said.“We have deployed personnel from the provincial armed constabulary as well as the civil police. The temporary jail premises has been fully cordoned off,” Neeraj Kumar Jadaun, superintendent of police (rural), said.According to police, the seven Nepal nationals were booked from Tila Morh and Muradnagar police station areas while the 10 Indonesian nationals were booked from Sahibabad police station. The police said they had attended religious congregations and were living in hiding in Ghaziabad.The five other persons, who are residents of Ghaziabad, were booked for molestation and other charges at the Kotwali police station.The UP cabinet Wednesday also brought in the Uttar Pradesh Epidemic Disease Control Ordinance, 2020, which spells stricter punishment for persons involved in intentionally spreading the disease, hiding infected or suspected persons and attacking those in the front-line of the Covid-19 fight.“The provisions in the Ordinance are cognisable and non-bailable. If there is violation of treatment by anyone like in quarantine centre etc, there is provision of punishment rangign from imprisonment of one year to three years. If anyone attacks health care workers, staff members, police and others involved in Covid-19 duties, there is provision of imprisonment of up to five years. In case of a grievous attack, the punishment is up to seven years,” Amit Mohan Prasad, principal secretary (health), Uttar Pradesh, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/22-including-five-who-misbehaved-with-nurses-sent-to-temporary-jail/story-t84C74PXbuiX1aQFbMaRBI.html
06-05-2020||Mumbai||Experts hint at community transmission, BMC denies claim||With the city witnessing a rapid rise in Covid-19 cases every day, the question that is repeatedly being asked is: Has the community transmission begun in Mumbai? While experts say there is a possibility of the community transmission, civic officials have outrightly denied the same. Majority of the city’s Covid-19 cases have come from certain areas - Worli-Prabhadevi, Dharavi, Govandi, Kurla and Byculla. While the count in Worli-Prabhadevi could be reaching 1,000, Dharavi has crossed 700 cases. Dr Shashikant Ahankari, a community health specialist, said that there is a thin line between local and community spread of coronavirus. “The community spread of the virus has already started, but don’t know why the authorities are denying it. In the last 15 days, several people have tested positive for the virus without any travel or any contact history. “ BMC has estimated 75,000 coronavirus cases, which indicates the community spread,” said Ahankari. “If there is no community spread in Mumbai then authorities should tell why Covid-19 cases [with no travel or contact history] are increasing daily, specifically in Dharavi?”, he said.A document detailing a three-pronged surveillance strategy, to screen people for possible Covid-19 symptoms, drafted by the BMC on May 4, 2020, also states that the community spread is limited since only 238 out of 11,591 who were tested in fever clinics were found positive.However, municipal commissioner Praveen Pardeshi said, “There is no community spread of disease in our city. Our rate of detection of cases through fever clinics is very less, which is a good sign for the city.”Dr Daksha Shah, deputy director, health department BMC said surveillance regarding the community spread is being conducted by the experts from the ICMR. “To declare community spread of disease is not under our jurisdiction. As of now, we have not any such information about the community spread of disease in the city.”There are four main stages of the disease outbreak. Stage one is usually when cases are imported and are not of local origin. Stage two is when there is a local transmission, which means a section of people testing positive has come in contact with a positive patient having a travel history. Stage three is community transmission and stage four is an epidemic when there are several clusters of the infection.Anticipating the future outbreak of the coronavirus, BMC is ramping up healthcare infrastructure.Elaborating strategy further, the document states that the BMC has divided Covid-19 patients under the symptomatic and asymptomatic category. All symptomatic patients will be sent to dedicated Covid-19 hospitals. The civic body has arranged 7,500 beds. 5,000 more beds are identified from different private hospitals. As of now more the than 25,000 isolation beds already in place at hotels, lodges, marriage halls and sports complexes. In a view to upgrade bed capacity, the civic body has identified more than 350 municipal schools to create additional capacity of 35,000 beds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/experts-hint-at-community-transmission-bmc-denies-claim/story-lJcD0n4eZLzyV6vXkVvXHI.html
06-05-2020||Noida||Noida: Edu dept seeks report on online classes from colleges, only then dispense salaries||Taking serious notes of negative feedback received from students about online classes, the regional higher education office (RHEO) has asked colleges to furnish details of online classes held so far. The RHEO has also warned colleges that staff salaries will be withheld, if they don’t conduct online classes more frequently. In a recent feedback taken from students, around 40% students complained of technical problems hampering online classes, while 10% said online classes are being held only to fulfil the quorum.The higher education officer (Meerut region) RK Gupta said till Wednesday, the department has received 2,693 online feedbacks from the students of 68 government and aided colleges, operating in Meerut division. “While Ghaziabad students have given the maximum feedback (63%), their Meerut counterparts have given lowest feedback (1.08%). Among other districts of the region, Baghpat responded 17.52%, Bulandshahr 6.74% and Saharanpur 4.66%. The feedback from Hapur and Gautam Budh Nagar districts have been recorded at 2.75% and 1.5%, respectively,” he said.Gupta further said as per the feedback, while 50% students have raised technical problems due to which they have not been able take online classes properly, another 10% have complained of no or poor internet connectivity in their residential areas. “The remaining 40% have either poor audio problems or they are not comfortable with existing format of online classes. We have asked the colleges to rectify all these problems. The principals of different colleges have been asked to provide the complete details of online classes and the teachers taking them. The regional education department will release salaries for only those colleges that provide us the complete report,” he said.He further said that around 12% of the students, who had sent their feedback, feel that since the video lessons of every subject is available on different online sites; the online classes are of no use for them.However, some students feel that online classes are a better way for completing their remaining syllabus as regular classes have been hampered due to the nationwide lockdown due to the Covid-19 outbreak. Gajinder Singh, one of the students, said he has been attending the classes regularly. “Assignments and these classes are keeping us busy. Question and answer sessions are also very effective,” he said.When contacted, Rajinder Singh, who teaches in Mihir Bhoj PG College at Dadri said all teachers of his college are regularly holding online classes.Echoing similar views, Meenakshi Lohani, a teacher in Kumari Mayawati Government Girls’ PG college at Badalpur, said, “In all 10 postgraduate subjects, we are holding online classes.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-edu-dept-seeks-report-on-online-classes-from-colleges-only-then-dispense-salaries/story-BAXRojYl48y19mxmXPqEyK.html

It had allowed five non-essential shops to remain open on one road. This led to crowding in most areas, violating social distancing norms. On Wednesday, Thane Municipal Corporation issued directives to keep only essential shops open.Non-essential shops have been shut since March 20. The shops were allowed to open on May 4 after the norms were relaxed by civic commissioner.Sandeep Malvi, deputy municipal commissioner of TMC, said, “We observed that none of the social distancing norms were followed as there were crowds in most shops. There was also law and order situation in some areas. The infection will increase if people do not follow social distancing norms, so the commissioner has revoked the relaxation. Only essential shops will remain open in the city.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/non-essential-shops-in-thane-to-remain-shut/story-IoOOpBErMkgYGdP49TMYPI.html

The permissions follows guidelines from the Union ministry of home affairs (MHA) that allowed for construction activities that followed social distancing norms and had labourers on site (called in-situ construction activities) from May 4 when phase-3 of the lockdown began.Secretary of the Ghaziabad development authority, S K Rai, confirmed that the permissions for the two projects was given.Officials related to the projects said that they have started with limited construction activity and will scale up work in coming few weeks.“At present, we have started work at our casting yard at Vasundhara. We have also prepared our standard operating protocols (SOPs) for work,” said Sudhir Sharma, chief public relations officer of the NCR Transport Corporation (NCRTC) that is in charge of the RRTS.People with NCRTC said that about 1,000 workers are on-site at present.The NCRTC has already started work for a 17-km priority stretch of the project that connects Delhi, Ghaziabad and Meerut over a stretch of 82km.Bombardier to build trainsIn another major development, the NCRTC officials said that they have also finalised bids for procurement of rolling stock of the Delhi-Ghaziabad-Meerut RRTS corridor under the Make in India initiative of the central government.The rolling stock will be 30 trains of six coaches each for the Delhi-Ghaziabad-Meerut corridor and another set of 10 trains having three coaches each for metro-like train services in Meerut. Officials said that the supply cost will be about ₹1560 crore (excluding taxes) and the first train will be supplied in 2022. “The train sets will be manufactured by Bombardier Transportation India Private Limited at their Savli plant in Gujarat. The winning bid offered to manufacture 100% of the rolling stock using 83% local content,” Sharma added.Under the conditions of the bid, at least 75% was to be mandatorily manufactured in India and purchase preference would also be given to manufacturers using more than 50% local content (local technology etc).NCRTC officials said that the rolling stock will be the first of its kind in the country with a design speed of 180kmph. The trains will be designed with high-acceleration and high-deceleration component that trains need to undergo given the maximum operational speed of 160kmph and stations at every 5-10kms.The trains will also have automatic plug-in type doors reducing air-friction and noise.“Keeping the commuter convenience in mind, the 3.2-meter wide RRTS trains will have 2x2 transverse seating arrangements like ones in Shatabdi Express trains and also have comfortable standing space. There will be enough space for luggage, CCTV cameras, and other modern amenities,” said an officer from NCRTC.Delhi-Meerut ExpresswayNational Highways Authority of India (NHAI) officials said that they have started work on the Delhi Meerut Expressway project at Vijay Nagar under phase 2 (UP-Gate to Dasna) and phase 4 stretch from Dasna to Meerut.“Although we have started construction, 75% of our workers had left for their home towns amid the coronavirus crisis. We are trying to rope in local workers to increase workforce availability to 40%. At present, we estimate that only 15-20% work efficiency with limited workers and timing restrictions from 7am to 7pm,” said RP Singh, project director of NHAI.According to officials, the entire project was to get complete by this month but likely to be delayed by about six months due to the lockdown and the upcoming monsoon season.“We require about 100 clear working days to finish the pending project work. But this can be achieved when we work with optimum workers,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lockdown-3-0-rrts-and-delhi-meerut-expressway-given-nod-to-start-construction-work-40-rrts-trains-to-be-manufactured-under-make-in-india-by-bombardier/story-7H68mRHVJZzCpAaQdNUSEO.html

The woman, who recently gave birth, was admitted to the hospital along with her newborn.The woman said on Wednesday afternoon, a man wearing a protection kit approached her and asked her for her urine and milk samples for testing. The man was accompanied by another one and both claimed to be doctors.The first man then took her to collect the samples. “I am lactating and have been breastfeeding my baby. They were wearing masks and so I couldn’t make out their faces and whether they were doctors or hospital staff. One of them gave me bottles for the milk and urine samples and then molested me,” the woman said.The Knowledge Park police station has filed an FIR into the incident based on a complaint given by Sharda hospital. The suspects have booked under Section 354 (assault or criminal force on woman with intent to outrage her modesty) of the Indian Penal Code. “We have registered a case against two persons who worked as ward boys at Sharda hospital for molesting a Covid-19 patient. They are attached to an outsourcing company that was contracted by the hospital,” Rajesh Kumar, deputy commissioner of police, zone 3, said.Health officials will also be conducting Covid-19 test on the two suspects as they had come in close contact with a Covid-19 positive patient.The woman said she immediately called her husband who is currently under institutional quarantine at the Galgotias hostel in Greater Noida. “My wife informed me that two men touched her inappropriately. I am in quarantine while both my wife and child are in the isolation ward. I am helpless as I cannot go to her. She is very worried and we are shocked that such an incident could happen with a Covid-19 patient, given the round-the-clock monitoring,” he husband of the woman said.When HT contacted Sharda hospital authorities, they said the ward boys were immediately sacked. “We have spoken to the woman. We have handed over the persons to the police from the Knowledge Park police station. We have given notice to the outsourcing company that had employed the ward boy. They have been removed with immediate effect. The nurses have spoken to the woman and comforted her,” the Sharda hospital spokesperson said.“We have sent our officers to collect the evidence and to take the statement of the husband as well. We can’t enter the isolation ward where the woman is kept and so we are trying to speak to her as well. Appropriate action will be taken against the persons responsible,” DCP Rajesh Kumar said.The district magistrate has also ordered an inquiry into the matter. “I have ordered an inquiry in the matter and have asked officials to find out the details. If anybody is found guilty of doing such a disgraceful act, then strict action will be taken against that person,” Suhas LY, district magistrate, Gautam Budh Nagar, said.The 20-year-old woman gave birth to a girl at a Noida hospital on April 25 and doctors had taken her sample, as per protocol, for Covid-19 testing. On May 3, the woman tested positive for the infection and she was admitted to the Sharda hospital. Her husband and brother-in-law were shifted to the quarantine centre.According to doctors, if a Covid-19 woman gives birth but avoids breastfeeding, then chances of the child getting the infection is almost nil. In this case, the woman was breastfeeding which increases the chances of the infant contracting the virus.There are six Covid-19 pregnant women undergoing treatment at the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) in Greater Noida and all of them have given birth in the last one week. Three deliveries are normal while three were Caesarean sections. One baby was negative for Covid-19 infection, while another tested positive. The reports of the remaining four are awaited.Meanwhile, the mother of another Covid-19 positive four-day-old baby allegedly hid the details of four of her other children from the contact tracing team. Officials said the four children were with their relatives. The children and the relatives were put in quarantine on Wednesday. The husband of the woman is also positive for the infection.No new cases of Covid-19 were reported from the district on Wednesday and the total number of such cases remained 192 in the district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/20-year-old-covid-19-patient-who-recently-gave-birth-molested-by-ward-boys/story-RqyiezeVDmKtT3GDMSZFSN.html
06-05-2020||City||Industrial and commercial zones of trans-Hindon least noisy during the lockdown period||The commercial and industrial zones in trans-Hindon areas of Ghaziabad had it easy on their ears during the ongoing lockdown. Data compiled by the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) found that there was significant decrease in noise -- anywhere between 2.3 decibels and 29 decibels (day time data) --- in the four zones of residential, commercial, silent and industrial during the month of April as compared to the month of February.The nationwide lockdown to combat the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) came into effect on March 25 and has now been extended until May 17.The UPPCB carried out a noise pollution analysis of the pre-lockdown months of February and March (last week under lockdown) and also for the month of April. According to officials, the standard of noise (day time) for residential is 55 decibels, commercial is 65, silent is 50 and industrial zone in 75 decibels.For the month of March, there was a marginal decrease in average noise pollution levels which ranged between .38 decibels and a maximum of 6.8 decibels in the four zones as compared to February.The maximum reduction was in April, which was a complete lockdown period. The figures reveal that the reduction in noise pollution was the most in industrial areas followed by commercial ones.Residential areas, with a sampling taken from Vasundhara Sector 16, Indirapuram, Rajendra Nagar and Kaushambi, witnessed only marginal decline of an average of 5.6 decibels in day time figures in April when compared to February.Of the four sampling points, the major reduction of 6.7, 6.4, 5.7 and 3.6 decibels took place at Rajendra Nagar, Vasundhara, Indirapuram and Kaushambi, respectively.“The residential areas are already on the lower side in terms of noise pollution and so there has been a small reduction in noise pollution levels during the lockdown period as local vehicles also stopped plying. In places like Kaushambi, the noise pollution reduction is just 3.6 decibels because the locality is near the Anand Vihar ISBT and the Delhi border and there is some movement of vehicles on the Delhi Ring Road,” Utsav Sharma, regional officer, UPPCB, Ghaziabad, said.Overall, the average reduction in the month of April as compared to the month of February was 5.6, 11.25, 4.4 and 26.5 for residential, commercial, silent and industrial zones, respectively.While the noise level decrease was only marginal in residential areas, residents of Kaushambi, Vaishali and Vasundhara got a major relief as the noise pollution from nearby industrial areas was very low.In areas of Indirpauram, the major reduction in noise leve was due to stringent curbs on movement of traffic on NH-9 and CISF Road.The noise level reduction in industrial areas was the most with an average reduction of 26.5 decibels in the month of April as compared to February. The sampling was taken by UPPCB from four industrial areas of Sahibabad, Anand Industrial area, Rajendra Nagar Industrial Area and Loni Road Industrial area.The maximum reduction of 29 decibels was observed at Anand Industrial Area near Mohan Nagar in the month of April as compared to the month of February when the industrial units were fully operational. Likewise, the least reduction of 24.4 decibels was witnessed from Sahibabad Site 4 Industrial Area.“The major reduction in noise is in industrial areas as they were mostly closed during the lockdown period and only a few units engaged in essential items delivery were operational. The closure also led to a high reduction in movement of heavy vehicles through the narrow roads which are found in industrial areas. Further, since many units were closed, the dependency on diesel generator sets was also minimal. So, the industrial areas witnessed major reduction in noise pollution,” Sharma explained.Apart from the industrial segments, the commercial zones like the ones of Vaishali Metro station, Mohan Nagar crossing, Kaushambi bus stand and Sahibabad vegetable market also saw reduced noise -- between 4 decibels and 20.8 decibels in April -- as compared to February.The average reduction in all four sampling points of commercial zones was 11.25 decibels in April as compared to February.The maximum reduction of 20.8 decibels was at Mohan Nagar intersection while Vaishali Metro station saw a decline of 14.10 decibels in April. The Sahibabad vegetable market witnessed the least reduction --of only 4 decibels -- as the market continued its operations even during the lockdown period and catered to supply of essential items like fruits and vegetables.As per the guidelines of the home ministry and the directions by the UP government, all major commercial centres, markets, market complexes and malls, multiplexes and cinema halls have remained shut and will continue to be so till May 17.Environmentalists say the reduced noise and pollution levels will benefit birds as well as humans.“Nowadays, residents can hear chirping of birds throughout the day and even common birds like sparrows, kingfishers and peacocks can be seen on trees around houses. Even, residents feel better in a peaceful environment and this in turn results in better creativity and concentration. We must try to maintain such an environment at all times,” Akash Vashishtha, a Ghaziabad based environmentalist and lawyer, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/industrial-and-commercial-zones-of-trans-hindon-least-noisy-during-the-lockdown-period/story-lksLuhSOPIv0C8LrCEkg0K.html
06-05-2020||Gurugram||Khandsa Mandi closed, vegetable prices burn a hole in pocket||Vegetable prices has started to witness a spike after supply started drying up following the closure of Khandsa Mandi, the city’s biggest vegetable market, till May 8.Around 6,000 quintals (60,000 kilos) of vegetables from Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, and nearby Mewat used to arrive at Khandsa Mandi daily, from where thousands of local vendors procured their stocks to further sell to residents across the city.The market was shut on May 5 (Tuesday) for sanitisation after nine vegetable vendors there tested positive for Covid-19.Ashok Yadav, a vegetable vendor in sector 50, said that he usually has 32 varieties of vegetables to sell to his customers. On Wednesday, he had only four.“I source all my vegetables from Khandsa Mandi. Now that the market is hut, I have been left in a lurch. I only had stock of four vegetables and that’s all I was able to offer to my customers today (Wednesday). An acquaintance of mine distributes vegetables in Faridabad and I am trying to place an order with him so that I have something to sell for the next two days. Else, I will have to close my store temporarily,” said Yadav.Vishal Singh, a roadside vegetable vendor at Sadar Bazar, said that after a lot of attempts he was able to procure vegetables from a vegetable market on New Railway Road at reasonable rates.“After travelling across the city for two hours, I managed to find a vegetable market on New Railway Road where vegetables were being sold at at an affordable rate. I had visited three stores before that and each of them were selling vegetables at nearly double the rate than that at Khandsa Mandi. Due to the extra travelling and higher prices of vegetables, I had to increase my price by around 60% to recover the extra costs,” said Singh.Singh said that he sold brinjals and bottle gourd at Rs 80 per kilogram and Rs 65 respectively, against Rs 50 and Rs 45 last week.The shortage in vegetables has also affected its quality, with residents complaining that the stock being sold now was inferior.“My roadside vendor informed me about the closure of Khandsa Mandi. They either managed to procure really inferior quality of vegetables from somewhere else or were selling the leftover stock at a slightly higher price. I usually buy enough vegetables to last me five-six days but after sifting through the stock, I just bought enough to last me for two days this time. The quality of vegetables was very bad,” said Upasana Gujral, a resident of DLF Phase 4.Gujral said on Wednesday she purchased okra at Rs 65 per kilogram, as compared to Rs 40 per kilo two days ago.Haryana State Agricultural Marketing Board (HSAMB) officials admitted that there was an issue with regards to distribution of vegetables due to the closing of the market but said there has been no change in regards to the supply in vegetables to the warehouses.Vinay Yadav, secretary of HSAMB said that the Khandsa Mandi will reopen on early Saturday morning and the situation will normalise after that.“Overall there has been no impact on the supply of vegetables from other states and from within Haryana as they are directly stocked in warehouses. It is the distribution at local stores and road-side vendors which has been affected due to the closing of Khandsa Mandi. At the big retail shops and online-vegetable delivery platforms, which directly get their supply from the warehouses, there has been no change in supply or prices,” said Yadav.He said that HSAMB officials conducted random checks for inflation in vegetable prices but did not find any instances of violation so far.“Our first batch of officials did random checks at big retail stores and also checked online-delivery platforms and found no change in regards to prices. A report from another team, which is checking local vendors and stores, is awaited. Either way, the market will reopen on Saturday morning after which the supply of vegetables across the city will resume as usual,” said Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/khandsa-mandi-closed-vegetable-prices-burn-a-hole-in-pocket/story-LBn4DxlUgMxX34OTAIxDwK.html
06-05-2020||City||Rs 500 fine for violating Covid-19 norms in markets||Gurugram: The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) will impose a fine of Rs 500 on shopkeepers and customers in the markets who are found violating the safety guidelines issued to contain the Covid-19 spread, said officials on Wednesday.On May 3, a day before standalone shops, shops in residential areas and HSVP markets, parlours and salons were permitted to reopen their establishments, the MCG had issued a standard operating procedure (SOP) for shopkeepers and residents to follow. As per the SOP, all shopkeepers and visitors have to wear masks, residents have to maintain a distance of six feet while standing in queues, guards have to be positioned at entry points of air-conditioned shops with thermal scanners and hand sanitizers, while also limiting the total number of customers inside a shop to less than five, among others.

The order further stated that action under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code, which invites a penalty of Rs 200, imprisonment of up to one month or both, can also be levied for a violation of the SOP.“Markets and shops are places which witness high footfall. Hence, the provisions under the SOP are essential to limit and contain the spread of coronavirus. Violations in this regard will be taken seriously and penalties will be levied immediately,” said SS Rohilla, public relation officer (PRO), MCG.On May 3, the district administration’s order had said that shops can be opened between 7am and 7 pm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rs-500-fine-for-violating-covid-19-norms-in-markets/story-FYe7uvk0w517KtOb1r6YsI.html
06-05-2020||City||Long queues seen outside liquor shops in Gurugram||leena.dhankhar@htlive.comGurugramLong queues were seen outside liquor shops across the district, which reopened on Wednesday morning after a gap of about 50 days. Many people had arrived at the vends well ahead of their opening time of 7am. However, unlike the chaotic situation in other NCR cities that opened their liquor shops on Monday, the rush in Gurugram remained under control and social distancing norms were maintained at all places, the police said.The Haryana government on March 26 had decided to temporarily shut down all the liquor vends across the state as part of its preventive measures to curb the spread of Covid-19 outbreak. On Wednesday, serpentine queues outside liquor stores were seen in areas such as Golf Course Road, Sohna Road, MG Road, Sector 18, and Sector 40. In Sector 40, more than 400 people were seen waiting for the shop to open.Swati Kishore, who had lined up at Sector 40 liquor shop at 6am to buy liquor, said she did not expect such a huge police presence outside the liquor shops. “I had to wait for almost two hours before I bought my stock. But everything was so well managed and buyers were given ample time to pick their stock,” she said.Another buyer, Preeti Tehlan, said that she and her friends had reached the shop at Sector 18 around 6am and had packed their breakfast which they had standing in the queue. “The shopkeeper provided water and tea for the people who were waiting since early morning. I will remember this experience, as we had never imagined standing in a queue for more than two hours just to buy liquor,” she said.Learning from the experience of neighbouring cities of Delhi and Noida, more than 3,000 police personnel and home guards were deployed at the 218 liquor vends (including two wholesale shops) across the district. According to police officials, more than 40 personnel were deployed at the Sector 40 shop where the maximum number of people visited to buy liquor. The police also distributed 2,000 face masks to people who were seen using a piece of cloth to cover their faces.Aman Yadav, assistant commissioner of police (Sadar), said that they had formed teams on Tuesday night which included excise officials also and they had demarcated lines and circles outside the shops to ensure social distancing. “Barricades were set up 100 metres before the liquor vends to control the crowd and strict directions were given to the shopkeepers to ensure people are wearing face masks and using sanitisers before entering the shops,” he said.Announcing a series of relaxations in the district during the third phase of the lockdown, the Gurugram administration has allowed the liquor shops to open in the non-containment zones from 7am to 7pm.Meanwhile, the government has imposed a variable Covid cess on all types of liquor to support areas and institutions, which have been adversely hit by the pandemic. A Covid cess of Rs 50 will be levied on a bottle greater than 375 ML of Imported Foreign Liquor (IFL), Rs 5 for strong beer, Rs 2 for other beer and Rs 5 per quarter in case of country liquor, and Rs 20 per quarter for Indian-made foreign liquor (IMFL). Many people alleged that they were overcharged and same brand was sold at different prices at different shops. Aruna Singh, deputy excise and taxation officer (East), said, “The Haryana government’s excise policy has fixed the minimum selling price (MSP) of liquor, but there is no cap on maximum price. As a result, liquor prices vary from outlet to outlet. “The concept of not standardising retail price gives a free hand to the vend to sell at their will,” Singh said.H C Dahiya, deputy excise and taxation officer (West), said they had deployed teams and ensured that one official of excise department was deployed at each liquor vend. “After the situation went out of control in Delhi, we had planned to mark circles for people to stand outside the shops. Also, we had given strict instructions to the shopkeepers that if anyone found entertaining violators, their licences will be cancelled,” Dahiya said.The excise officials had to take a call on capping the number of bottles per person, after some people were seen buying in bulk. In many areas, people were seen buying more than 100 bottles at a time, including beer cases, the officials said.Singh said as per the tentative sales figures, IMFL and beer bottles worth Rs 1 crore were sold, while Imported Foreign Liquor was sold for nearly Rs 10 lakh from New Gurugram areas like Sohna Road, Golf Course Road and Golf Course Extension Road.According to the police, some people even visited wholesale shops thinking that they would get some discounts, but they were asked to buy only 36 bottles per person.At most of the shops, the owners had put up steel and the bamboo barrier to maintain queues and had hired security personnel to ensure social distancing.Muhammad Akil, commissioner of police, said, “More than 25 police personnel were deployed at each liquor shop and 10 more outside the road to control traffic congestion and wrong parking.

06-05-2020||Mumbai||12.5 lakh litres liquor sold in Maharashtra on Wednesday||Approximately 12.5 lakh litres of alcoholic drinks worth around Rs 43.75 crore were sold on Wednesday across the state even as liquor sale was prohibited in major cities like Mumbai and Nagpur.The figure was low as the state sees a sale of approximately 24 lakh litres daily in normal times. On Tuesday, the figure stood at 16.10 lakh litres with the liquor worth Rs 62.55 crore being sold.According to excise officials, the fall is due to various reasons like non-availability in various cities like Mumbai and Nagpur along with restricted timings and also the problem in the supply chain. “Many people are not ready to line up and are waiting for the situation to ease. Also in rural areas, the wine shops do not have adequate stock,” said the official who refused to come on record.There was also despondency among both the liquor merchants as well as tipplers over the decision of Mumbai municipal commissioner Pravin Pardeshi over the decision to stop the sale of liquor from Wednesday. “People need to change their attitude towards drinking. After sitting at home for days, people will get some diversion,” said Nishid Gala, a resident of Parel.Meanwhile, the Akhil Bhartiya Grahak Panchayat (ABGP) wants the liquor shops to be shut down. “Liquor is not an essential commodity and is, in fact, harmful. If the Government really wants to earn revenue there are other means too,” said Sriram Pathak, managing committee member, ABGP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/12-5-lakh-litres-liquor-sold-in-maharashtra-on-wednesday/story-hQd6ZItsyNyt0S2XBkWupM.html
06-05-2020||Chandigarh||Active cases breach 100 mark in Chandigarh||The number of active Covid-19 cases in Chandigarh went beyond the 100 mark for the first time in Chandigarh, with nine people testing positive for the infection on Wednesday. It took the total tally of confirmed cases to 124, of whom 21 have recovered while one has died, bringing the active cases to 102.Among the fresh cases, eight are from the hotspot Bapu Dham Colony, Sector 26, including four women of one family, and one from Sector 56.The four women are aged 18, 24, 35 and 41. Also, two men and two women from two other families have got infected. With this, the number of cases in the congested colony has rose to 66, which accounts for 53% of the total cases and 64% of the active cases in Chandigarh.Infected man escapes to UP on bikeMeanwhile, a 34-year-old man from Sector 56, who was tested positive at the Mohali civil hospital on Tuesday evening, escaped from the city on his bike and travelled 800km to reach his village in Uttar Pradesh on Wednesday.A senior UT health official said that the patient was sent home and told to self isolate till the tests results were out. However, the man travelled to his native village, Purenewali, in Partapgarh district of Uttar Pradesh (UP), instead.An official, on the condition of anonymity, said, “It is surprising that the patient was permitted to go home and quarantine himself. The doctors at the Mohali civil hospital should not have allowed the patient to go home in the first place. They also failed to inform the health and quarantine authorities in Chandigarh.”Mohali civil surgeon Dr Manjit Singh said, “It is our protocol that whenever we collect a sample, we ask the patient to quarantine themselves at home. In case the report comes positive, the patients are shifted to Gian Sagar Hospital in Banur.”Only serious cases in PGIMERThe increasing number of cases has prompted the authorities to admit patients with only serious complications to the dedicated Covid-19 hospital at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), while new asymptomatic and mild cases will be admitted to the Shri Dhanwantry Ayurvedic College and Hospital in Sector 46.UT health secretary Arun Kumar Gupta said the decision has been taken keeping in view requests made by the PGIMER that maximum number of persons admitted in the hospital do not require specialised medical treatment and just need to be isolated.“Guidelines from the central government state that mild and asymptomatic cases should be taken care of in Covid-19 care centres and thus this is the first step in that direction. The infrastructure available in the Sector 46 hospital is fine for 60 patients and they have their own force of healthcare workers, which will be supplemented by the resident doctor from Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32,” he said.PGIMER director Dr Jagat Ram said after this decision, the institute can utilise its energy on the management of serious patients and it has already utilised 50% of the capacity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/active-cases-breach-100-mark-in-chandigarh/story-dAO4gROLHQS0D0ZEUl26jJ.html

06-05-2020||City||Day One: 58% liquor vends in P’kula dist open for business||A day after Haryana government gave a nod to open liquor vends, only 36 of 62 liquor stores across Panchkula district, including Pinjore, Kalka, Barwala and Raipur Rani, opened for business. However, in Panchkula city, only five of 22 vends opened on Tuesday. However, unlike the scenario that played out in Delhi and other cities, Panchkula witnessed no jostling or long queues for alcohol on the first day. The number of people queued up outside the stores was also not more than 25 at a time.Stores that opened to business included those in Sector 5 (near Bella Vista hotel), Majri chowk, Sectors 20, 28 and 21. People in queues outside the vends had worn masks and were found complying with social distancing norms.Braving the scorching heat, they stood patiently within the painted circles, in two to three queues with five persons each. While many were seen taking home boxes of beer, others bought whiskey and scotch. While some complained about not getting their favourite brands, but they made do with whatever was available.Policemen and homeguard volunteers were also deputed outside stores to keep a check.However, the posh liquor stores and showrooms, mostly in Sector 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 14, 16, and the Industrial Area were found closed. Many liquor vends that did not open on Wednesday due to stock and takeover issues, will most likely open from Thursday onward, an official said.All liquor shops in Haryana were closed from March 27 amid the lockdown. To those who had been waiting for 40 days, hiked prices of their tipple did not matter. Even though vends overcharged them by ₹20 to ₹70, people could be seen stocking up as much as possible.Sector-12 resident Aakash Manocha who had come to Sector 20 to stock up, said, “I couldn’t find any stores in the vicinity open, but a friend told me about this store. It has been a month without booze. They charged me ₹50 more for my brand, but I am okay with it.”Sumit, a Sector-4 resident, had come to Sector 21 to buy his tipple. “My cousin and I were relieved to see such a small queue and no chaos. Though we were overcharged ₹20 for each bottle of beer, frankly it didn’t matter. We made do without it for 40 days.”As per a district excise department official, in Panchkula, liquor vends are distributed over 34 zones. Of these, 31 zones were auctioned under the excise policy for the year 2020-2021. Every zone has two vends each, making for 68 vends in the district, with only 62 open for business as yet.“In March, before the liquor stores closed, the district excise department had earned a revenue of more ₹7 crore,” said an official. In the financial year 2019–20, Haryana had earned ₹152 crores, which comes to about ₹12.7 crore per month, he said.Panchkula’s deputy excise and taxation commissioner (DETC), Pardeep Yadav, said that some shops did not open as new vendors were still in the process of takeover and sales. They will probably open from Thursday onward. We have instructed all liquor vend contractors to ensure their employees follow Covid-19 guidelines.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/day-one-58-liquor-vends-in-p-kula-dist-open-for-business/story-1MaMJGiaDjp6lEyo8JkoLP.html
06-05-2020||Lucknow||After lockdown, high-priced eatables hit Ramzan fervour||The holy month of Ramzan this year is not only facing troubles following the nationwide lockdown but the hands of the residents of Prayagraj are also tied up due to high costs of dates and other eatables consumed in the festive season. The higher prices of these commodities have made them out of reach of the poor and marginalised sections of the society who have little means of livelihood these days. Majority of daily wage earners in Muslim localities are out of work and their families are depending on help provided by social organisations and individuals. Although the vegetables are abundantly available at reasonable prices, fruits have gone costly and are out of reach of many. The lockdown has not only deprived the people of the usual lively evenings and nights of Ramzans, but many eatables are also missing from the ‘iftari’ (eatables consumed at the time of breaking fast), complained All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen leader Iftekhar Ahmad.The costs of all varieties of dates (khajur) have increased by around Rs 10 to Rs 30 per kilogram depending on their availability in the market. A local khajur trader Azeem said not only the supply of dates is lesser but people are also buying them in less quantity in comparison to last Ramzan. Prices of other fruits such as orange, grapes etc have also increased. However, watermelons are locally available in reasonable rates, he added.A grocer Habib claimed that besides decreased supply, the cost of all commodities has gone higher due to lockdown.AIMIM leader Afsar Mehmood said rates of sugar, besan, chips, papad, edible oils etc have gone higher by Rs 10 to Rs 30 at local stores depending on their availability. Even bottle of Rooh-afza (a sweet drink) is being sold at a higher price, Mehmood further informed.He demanded that the administration should ensure regular supply of eatables used during Ramzans and provide work opportunities to the poor and daily wage earners.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/after-lockdown-high-priced-eatables-hit-ramzan-fervour/story-yFKMs2xsemXymaHCWeGC6L.html
06-05-2020||Patna||IGIMS nurse among 7 positive; cases up at 542 in Bihar||A nursing staff at the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS) was among two cases of novel coronavirus (Covid-19) reported from Patna Wednesday after a brief eight-day lull, taking the total number of cases to 542 across the state so far.One case from Agamkuan and another from Raja Bazar locality, where the IGIMS is located, were among seven cases reported during the day. A case each was reported from Purnia, Madhubani, Sheohar, Bhagalpur and Kaimur.The source of infection in both the cases from Patna was unknown, said health officials.The 28-year-old IGIMS nursing officer, who is pregnant, complained of abdomen pain, when she was admitted to the hospital on Wednesday morning. In keeping with hospital norms, before any investigation of in-patients, her swab sample was taken for Covid-19 test and she tested positive for the virus by evening, said hospital sources. The woman resides at the nursing hostel on the IGIMS campus.Already, four paramedics and sanitation workers from the IGIMS have tested positive for the virus so far, said hospital sources.A 21-year-old jeweller from Agamkuan had also tested positive for the virus. The young man had been suffering from influenza-like symptoms for the last 10 days, said health officials. He had been shuttling from one hospital to another, after visiting the Patna Medical College Hospital, before he finally landed at the Nalanda Medical College Hospital on Tuesday where he tested positive for Covid-19, the officials added.With Patna in red zone, and most business establishments closed, health officials were clueless where the jeweller had contracted the infection from. He did not have any travel history either.The state government had sought clarification from the Centre for classifying Gaya under the red zone, said Bihar’s principal secretary, health, Sanjay Kumar in a tweet. He, however, did not mention the reason for it.Gaya has only six cases whereas Munger has 102, followed by Buxar (56), Rohtas (52) and Patna (46), which are in the red zone. The state government has classified the remaining 33 districts under orange zone.Meanwhile, the government said it was stepping up testing capacity in the state. “We now have seven research laboratories to conduct RT-PCR (real-time polymerase chain reaction, a confirmatory test for Covid-19). We are going to begin CB NAT test at the Darbhanga Medical College Hospital, the IGIMS and the Tuberculosis Demonstration & Training Centre, Agamkuan,” said health secretary Lokesh Kumar Singh.He said the government would also have testing facility through Truenat machines.“We will get 15 Truenat machines through the tuberculosis division of the government of India. We will install them at medical colleges where RT PCR testing facility is not available. Besides, we will also deploy them at districts having high concentration of cases,” added Singh.Forty six patients had recovered Wednesday, taking the total number of recoveries to 188 across the state so far, with 35% case recovery rate, said Singh.The good sign for Bihar was that its case doubling rate had now decreased from four days to nine days. The number of Covid-19 cases had gone up from 143 to 277 between April 22 and 26. It has now taken nine days for cases to double from 277 on April 26 to 536 on May 5, as per data shared by Sanjay Kumar through a tweet.The 542 Covid-19 cases were spread across 32 of Bihar’s 38 districts, with Munger topping at 102. It was followed by Buxar (56), Rohtas (52), Patna (46), Nalanda (36), Siwan (32), Kaimur (31), Madhubani (24), Gopalganj, Bhojpur (18 each), Aurangabad, Begusarai (13 each), Bhagalpur (12), West Champaran, Katihar (11 each), East Champaran (9), Saran (8), Gaya, Sitamarhi (6 each), Darbhanga, Arwal (5 each), Lakhisarai, Nawada, Jehanabad, (4 each), Banka, Vaishali (3 each), Madhepura, Araria, Purnea, Sheohar (2 each), Sheikhpura, Samastipur (1 each).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/igims-nurse-among-7-positive-cases-up-at-542-in-bihar/story-wSPVbJ30NxHPKThmxfVBaK.html
06-05-2020||Chandigarh||Over 1 lakh ‘ambassadors of hope’ take part in online campaign in Punjab||The online video campaign ‘Ambassadors of Hope’ to engage students during the lockdown saw participation of 1.06 lakh schoolchildren from across Punjab over eight days, state education minister Vijay Inder Singla said on Wednesday. Claiming that never before an online competition saw such a huge participation — wherein children made and shared videos of various activities — he said the government is in touch with the Guinness World Records for official recognition, he said.Maximum entries were received from Ludhiana district (16,084), followed by Amritsar (13,862), Sangrur (10,741), Patiala (10,614) and Gurdaspur (7,030), the minister said while talking to media in Chandigarh. Apart from these entries, the campaign also engaged around 2.5 crore people on social media platforms in eight days. He said the primary objective of this campaign was to engage students in a constructive activity in the “atmosphere of abject negativity”. “It is heartening to see the response we have got from the children. Most of the entries are deep rooted in Punjabi ethos and culture,” said Singla. “While we will select few winners on merit in next 20 days, for me everyone is a winner.”The minister said three winners from all 22 districts will be given prizes, which include laptops and tablets. Apart from this, 50 consolation prizes will also be given, he said.‘Can’t say when schools will reopen’Even as summer vacation in Punjab schools is set to officially get over on May 10, Singla said that he “can’t clearly give an answer” as to when schools would reopen for classroom teaching. Punjab had in April advanced summer holidays both in private and government schools to cope up with study losses due to the lockdown. “No one knows when normalcy will return. However, online classes can’t replace classroom teaching,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/over-1-lakh-ambassadors-of-hope-take-part-in-online-campaign-in-punjab/story-twk92xdVwd4Z5I1tl7lObK.html

06-05-2020||Patna||24 trains with over 28,000 migrants, students leave for Bihar||Over 15,000 migrants and students returned to state on Wednesday by 13 trains from five states while another 28,500 would be reaching from seven states in 24 trains on Thursday. With the increasing number of stranded natives returning to Bihar, the state has geared up to face the added challenges in the midst of Covid-19 pandemic.According to state disaster management department, 24 trains — one each from Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, and Kerala, eight from Gujarat, five each from Maharashtra and Telangana and three from Rajasthan — would be reaching 17 railway stations on Thursday while 13 trains from five states — Gujarat, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Telangana reached different parts on Wednesday.“We have entered a challenging phase, with more people returning to their home towns. The real test starts now,” said a senior state government official pleading anonymity.The government on Tuesday had claimed that migrant workers, who returned to Bihar from other states during the lockdown, accounted for only 65 cases of coronavirus, as the total number of cases rose to 541 across 32 of the 38 districts, with four deaths in the state so far. However, the state government claimed full preparedness. “The state is fully prepared to look after them. As of now 3,066 camps are ready and 18,066 migrant labourers are living in those camps,” said Pratyaya Amrit, principal secretary, disaster management department.However, experts do not seem to be happy with the preparedness. “The initial hiccups in bringing the stranded back shows their preparedness. The preparation is only up to a level, especially since the reports about the quarantine centres are coming out. The districts need to scale up their bar to cope up with this situation,” said D M Diwakar of A N Sinha Institute for Social Studies.A government official admitted that if close to 5-6 lakh people return, putting them in quarantine centres, feeding them everyday would be a Herculean task.Officials are also worried because many new infections have been reported during the second phase of the lockdown especially of those migrant workers, who managed to reach Bihar and unknowingly took the Covid to new areas as they were largely asymptomatic. This despite the fact that doubling rate of Covid 19 cases which was 7 days between April 15 and April 22 and came down to four days in the period between April 23 and 26, has now increased to 9 days in the period between April 26 and May 5, as per an information shared by principal secretary (health) Sanjay Kumar on his Twitter.STRAP CONUNDRUM: State claims it is prepared to take care of the returnees; experts feel otherwise||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/24-trains-with-over-28-000-migrants-students-leave-for-bihar/story-Zk1imS3UyJHVbYuGh23EWK.html
06-05-2020||Patna||Bihar mulls thrust on food processing units to deal with migrants’ problem||The food processing industries will soon be classified under the priority sector of the state industrial investment promotion policy. This was stated Wednesday by officials privy to the matter.The industries department is currently working on draft amendment to the policy so that the investors in the food processing sector could avail interest subsidy on project cost, electricity duty waiver and the state help in land procurement for the processing units.Although Bihar is among top producers of vegetables, fruits and crops, it has failed to invite huge investments in food processing industry, as it is currently under non-priority priority sector.Agriculture minister Prem Kumar said, “The draft amendment to include agro-based food processing industries under priority sector of the policy is being sent for the cabinet approval.”“This is one among the various schemes being mooted by the department to create job opportunities in the state during the lockdown phase,” said Kumar, after interacting with the top functionaries of the PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industries (PHDCCI), New Delhi, through video conferencing on Wednesday.In the meeting, which was attended by secretary of the agriculture department, the minister said that the state government has decided to offer up to 90% subsidy on project cost for setting up fruit and vegetable processing units, costing up to ₹10 lakh. “The department will encourage people or their group to set up smaller units across the state so that migrant labourers, who returned home during the lockdown, could be engaged,” said the minister.The department has for now allocated ₹12 crore for doling out subsidy to the entrepreneurs. “Fund is no constraint for development of horticulture based processing units. Additional money would be allotted from other heads for development of an integrated network of fruit and vegetable processing units. This will help a large quantity of farm produce which is being destroyed due to lockdown,” said Prem Kumar .Meanwhile, department officials said that the state government had stepped up efforts to form a state-level federation of farmers’ producer organisation (FPOs) to market the processed products at national and international-level with support from Nabard and other organisations.ONLINE TRAININGIn another objective to use the lockdown phase for productive use, the department has also formulated a plan to impart on-line training to individuals on farm technology and food processing methodology.“We have identified 23 types of training, which include mushroom cultivation, processing of vegetable and fruits, etc., for a group of 30 individuals. A sum of ₹12 crore would be spent on imparting training and providing certificates under the skill development mission,” said the minister.He said that the state would be able to woo investments in the food processing sectors once the industrial promotion policy is amended. “The state government has already proposed offering 50% subsidy on mega projects being executed by the FPOs, while individual investments would get 30% subsidy,” said Kumar.Senior vice-president of PHDCCI Sanjay Agrawal, agriculture committee chairman NK Agrawal, vice-president Pradeep Multani, general secretary Saurabh Sanya, principal director Yogesh Srivastava, director of Shivshakti Modern Flour Mills, Raxaul, Birendra Kumar and Neeraj Chaube of Ratnagiri Seeds and Farms Pvt Ltd attended the meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/bihar-mulls-thrust-on-food-processing-units-to-deal-with-migrants-problem/story-Hh0KPEOwT4sqy4HnTobk9I.html

06-05-2020||Patna||Nitish bats for skill profiling of migrants for suitable job creation||Aware of the potentials of the migrants who are returning to state after the extension of lockdown, Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar on Wednesday asked officials to carry out the skill survey of the migrants in order to effectively use their services. Thousands of migrant labourers have been rendered jobless due to lockdown in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic.Over 2 lakh migrants have so far returned to state after lockdown were announced.“We need to track their skill effectively so that after the end of quarantine period, we can use their services as per the guidelines,” said Kumar at a meeting with chief secretary and other senior officials on Wednesday. “They will contribute in a big way to state’s economy,” said Kumar.Kumar said that for more and more job creation apart from MNREGA, there should be efforts in multiple directions with less emphasis on use of machines. “MNREGA can create mandays and there is a need to monitor it in a better way,” he said.Chief secretary Deepak Kumar informed the chief minister that soon the skill survey of migrants will be done through an app.CM also instructed the officials to be sensitive to the feedbacks being received from different quarters. “Every complaint should be looked into, grievances should be addresses and every effort should be made to ensure that people can avail benefits of government’s schemes,” he said.Kumar also advised officials to ensure better screening and health tests of migrants at district levels.Experts have also opined that there was a growing need to work with a definite plan to convert reverse migration into an opportunity to drive state’s growth post lockdown. “All the migrants who are returning to the state in distress have some skill sets, which they used to contribute to the growth of other states. Apart from health profiling, this is a welcome move. The government should also do skill profiling of the migrants to work out a long-term strategy for their absorption within Bihar and use them as engines of growth,” said former director of AN Sinha Institute of Social Studies DM DiwakarShaibal Gupta of Asian Development Research Institute said that the government would need to increase the coverage of assured employment under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Programme (MNREGA)“It will have to be doubled in the present context. Besides, there is growing need for disbursal of small loans and increase absorption in agriculture, fishery, construction, small-scale industries and allied activities. From food processing to farm mechanization, there is a lot of scope,” said Shaibal Gupta of Asian Development Research InstituteTata Institute of Social Sciences, Patna centre director Pushpendra said that sustaining the reverse migration for a month at quarantine centres was quite possible for the government with its resources. “After that most of the labourers will get engaged in paddy sowing. The challenges will increase after that period and the government will have to keep its plan ready,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/nitish-bats-for-skill-profiling-of-migrants-for-suitable-job-creation/story-lYIGH3AytQUhwOp0V8b2KN.html

06-05-2020||City||Leg in cast, Bihar Anganwadi worker still on toes||PATNA: Vimla Devi, an anganwadi worker (AWW) who turned a widow at 31 years of age, some 15 years back, is an example for others.With her left leg in cast, after she fell and dislocated her bone, she hobbled to around 180 households, as part of the door-to-door survey initiated by the Bihar government last month to check for respiratory distress and influenza-like illness, which are associated with symptoms of coronavirus. The massive survey, which was earlier confined to only four districts, has now been extended to cover all 38 districts of the state.Draped in white sari, with red border, holding documents on a clipboard, she preferred taking a stick as a crutch to the helping hand extended by an auxiliary nursing midwife who accompanied her during the house-to-house survey.“I realised if I take leave, people in my area (the slum area adjacent to Patna Electricity Supply Undertaking quarters near New Secretariat area) will suffer. Given the adverse circumstances because of the coronavirus pandemic, I decided not to leave my people when they needed me the most,” said Vimla. “People in my area trust me. They will not allow any AWW other than me to administer polio drop or any other vaccination to their young children. It is a question of trust. I knew if any other AWW was drafted in my place to survey the area, many people may have been left out of the survey,” she added.Vimla stays in a one-room shanty near Lalit Bhawan on Bailey Road in Patna because she cannot afford a pucca house. Having lost her husband Vijay Kumar Singh early, she has three children — a 23-year-old daughter and two sons, aged 22 and 18, who are pursuing their studies. All she gets from the government is a monthly stipend of Rs 5,650 a month to ensure that the government’s social welfare programme reach the last man in queue.“Had my father not supported me, I wouldn’t have been able to survive with my children, leave aside educating them. Today, my daughter takes some private tuition of young children to keep the hearth of our house burning,” said Vimla.“Vimla was adamant to work, despite our willingness to grant her leave,” said Patna district programme officer Bharti Priyamvada, who is with the integrated child development services, an arm of the social welfare department.“She is a very active, dedicated and responsible worker who has never shied away from any responsibility entrusted upon her. She is not scared of any adversity too. In fact, I had granted her leave, but she did not avail of it,” said Renu Kumari, who is the child development project officer, Patna Sadar 1. Vimla’s zeal and dedication to work has won her accolades.Patna district magistrate Kumar Ravi was the first to acknowledge Vimla’s unflinching contribution through a tweet in which he shared the AWW’s photograph. Bihar’s principal secretary health, Sanjay Kumar, retweeted it from his personal Twitter handle, saluting her indomitable spirit. The likes on social media haven’t stopped pouring in ever since.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/leg-in-cast-bihar-anganwadi-worker-still-on-toes/story-rHc3S2g1osylS2x0QdCgEP.html

06-05-2020||Chandigarh||62 ‘high risk’ Bapu Dham residents under institutional quarantine in Chandigarh||The UT administration has put as many as 62 ‘high risk’ persons from Bapu Dham Colony in Sector 26, one of the city’s six containment zones, under institutional quarantine at a facility set up at the community centre in Sector 47.Unlike a home quarantine, an institutional quarantine is notified inside a government school, an indoor stadium, community centre or a building with toilet facilities.The move came after coronavirus cases in the city grew by 78% in the past two weeks, all from the six notified containment zones.On April 24, there were 28 cases in the city, which increased to 124 by Wednesday. Correspondingly, in less than two weeks, over 1,800 people have been put under home quarantine. More than 75% of the total cases in the city are from the six containment zones – Bapu Dham Colony, Labour Colony in Sector 30, Kachhi Colony in Dhanas, part of Sector 38, parts of Sector 52 and part of Shastri Nagar, Manimajra.Bapu Dham Colony with 66 cases of the total 124 accounts for more than 50% city’s cases. Labour Colony has 20 cases. All these areas have been sealed by the administration. An estimated around 80,000 people are in these zones.“Bringing them to institutional quarantine will help in constant medical supervision, and ensuring social distancing,” said a senior UT official, who didn’t want to be named.CHALLENGE OF SOCIAL DISTANCING UT’s move also comes in view of the latest guidelines issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs stressing on ensuring social distancing in highly congested areas.As per MHA order, high risk cases, which includes families with positive cases or people living in close proximity to those who have tested positive can be put under institutional quarantine. Notably, Bapu Dham Colony, the epicentre of coronavirus cases in the city, is home to 60,000 people residing in 2,500 multi-storey houses, with an average family of five sharing a room in a 25-yard house with shared toilets, thereby making social distancing practically impossible to be achieved here. When contacted, UT adviser Manoj Kumar Parida, said, “We cannot put the entire 60,000 people in Bapu Dham Colony under institutional quarantine, but we have started selectively and sent high risk cases to the quarantine centre in Sector 47.”INSIDE THE QUARANTINEAt the Sector 47 community centre, the quarantined persons have been given mattresses to sleep on the floor, are given food twice a day, and those from the same family have been kept in single rooms. However, some of the quarantined persons, talking to Hindustan Times, complained about poor sanitation, inadequate facilities and food at the centre. “We have apprised the officials of the poor quality of food, dirty toilets, and used masks dumped in the building,” said a quarantined person, who didn’t want to be named.The UT official, who responded to the complaints, said, “All the persons are being monitored by a team of doctors daily, which wasn’t possible in their houses. We have arranged for tea and milk, in addition to three-time meals. We are also cleaning and sanitising the centre daily.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/62-high-risk-bapu-dham-residents-under-institutional-quarantine-in-chandigarh/story-5Oys3gmHZLBe1zmSQWtw1O.html
06-05-2020||Delhi||Confusion prevails over reopening non-essential industrial pockets||Days after the Delhi government decided to allow industrial areas and construction sites to resume work, confusion still prevailed in several industrial pockets over the opening of units dealing in non-essential goods. While only 30%-35% factory units opened on Wednesday, construction work started at some of the major government project sites, officials said.Delhi industries minister Satyendar Jain, however, clarified that all types of industries that have access control mechanisms can reopen. Jain was addressing representatives of around 80 industrial associations at a video conference on Wednesday afternoon.An access control mechanism regulates the entry and exit of workers/employees in an industrial area/compound. The entry/exit points are required to be manned with records of employees entering the premises. This also includes thermal screening at the entry itself. Following the union home ministry’s order on allowing relaxations amid the ongoing nationwide lockdown, the Delhi government had, on Sunday, decided to allow industrial estates and townships to open, given that they ensure access control mechanism at entry/exit points and practice social distancing at work. Construction activities are allowed only where workers are available on site.However, till Wednesday afternoon only two districts—north and south-west—had issued standard operating guidelines while officials in other districts said they would be issuing similar orders within 24 hours.The guidelines included ensuring access control mechanisms, thermal screening, all workers downloading the Aarogya Setu app on their mobile phones, frequent washing of hands, and the provision of food on-site. The guidelines also stated that workers will not be allowed to share food/utensils and asked employers to arrange transport for workers coming from afar.Industry owners in some major hubs, including Udyog Nagar, Peeragadhi and Mundka, said they would keep their units shut till the time they received clear orders on the reopening of industries dealing in non-essential goods.“The union government’s order clearly states that only certain industries dealing in essentials are permitted to reopen. The industrial area was shut even today (Wednesday). We will open only once we get clear guidelines, as we don’t want to get into trouble later,” Ashok Gupta, president, Udyog Nagar Industrial Association, said. The units here mainly manufacture footwear and engineering goods. Delhi has 28 notified industrial areas; at least 23 such areas are notified under the umbrella of redevelopment and do not necessarily have access control mechanisms. According to Brijesh Goyal, convenor, Aam Aadmi Party’s trade and industry wing, around 6 lakh labourers of the estimated 10 lakh employed in industrial areas across the city are present in the city while the remaining left for their home towns soon after the lockdown was announced.Goyal, who had organised the meeting with Jain, said that there were complaints from some factory owners that a few local authorities had not issued clear guidelines on the provision of essential and non-essential services. Besides, he added that there were also complaints about the district authorities adding several points to the guidelines that are not mentioned in the MHA order.“The minister has clearly said that all kinds of industries in all areas with access control can reopen, irrespective of being essential or non-essential. He has asked all district authorities to issue clear guidelines so that industries can start work. Besides, he also said that the government will get measures not stated in the MHA order removed from the district magistrates’ orders,” Goyal said.Concerning downloading the Aarogya Setu app, he said that 80% of the workers do not have android phones. Also, in industrial areas like Libaspur-Samaypur Badli, which are notified under redevelopment, installing gates with access control mechanisms is a major concern before they can open the units.“We do not have any entry-exit gate. We have set a meeting with the local MLA and the area sub-divisional magistrate to allow us to reopen units dealing in iron and other materials required to install gates. It will take us at least 15 days before we can start work,” Alok Kansil, vice-president, Libaspur Industrial Welfare Association, said.Industry owners also said that there is little demand for non-essential goods and urged the government to reopen a few markets with limited staff so that there are takers for the goods that are being manufactured.At construction sites The public works department (PWD) on Wednesday started construction work at three major infrastructure project sites— a 1.2 km-long tunnel between Mathura Road and the Ring Road, Barapullah Phase-3 elevated corridor and the Seelampur and Shastri Park flyovers.According to estimates by construction agencies, around 450 workers are available at the tunnel construction site near Bhairon Marg, nearly 100 are available at the Shastri Park and Seelampur flyover sites in north-east Delhi, approximately 200 are at Barapullah Phase-3 project site near Sarai Kale Khan and Yamuna Basin near Mayur Vihar-1 while around 150 workers are available at the construction site of Benito-Juarez Road underpass in south Delhi.Construction agencies also said that 300 labourers are staying at the Netaji Nagar Redevelopment Project construction site, around 400 labourers each are present at the construction sites of a Central Reserve Police Force building and a National Investigation Agency building in Satbari area, Chattarpur. Besides, around 3,500 labourers are staying at different Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) construction sites across the city.“Presently, the DMRC has about 3,500 workers across five or six different sites in the city including actual work sites as well as casting yards for Phase-4 projects. All contractors have been instructed to get the Aarogya Setu app installed on the phones of all on-site personnel, including workers and engineers. All workers are being sensitised about precautionary guidelines during the tool workshops. Displays with the necessary information regarding social distancing are being installed at the sites. Masks, sanitiser and thermal scanners are being made available at the sites as well,” Anuj Dayal, executive director, corporate communications, DMRC, said.“All guidelines are being followed in letter and spirit. The construction work has begun after thoroughly disinfecting work sites and equipment. We are taking all measures to check the spread of the virus and ensure social distancing. Foot-operated hand wash dispensers and washbasins along with sanitiser have been made available at the project sites where construction has begun,” PWD engineer-in-chief PK Vats said.The National Buildings Construction Corporation (NBCC)-India Limited is helming around 15 projects in Delhi which include ITPO-Pragati Maidan redevelopment project, IIT Delhi, East Kidwai Nagar, Vanijya Bhawan, etc.“Today, work at almost all the sites is taking place with the available workforce. Some of these major projects include East Kidwai Nagar, Nauroji Nagar WTC, Vanijya Bhawan, IIT Delhi, WHO works, NIA Maidangarhi, NIDM works, etc. As far as safety precautions at worksites are concerned, we are providing masks and sanitiser to all labourers and ensuring social distancing. The NBCC also makes it sure that all contractors download the Aarogya Setu app, as also the workers who have smartphones,” PK Gupta, chairman and managing director of NBCC, said.Meanwhile, PWD officials said that downloading the Aarogya Setu app is not compulsory for construction workers. Those who have smartphones can download the app but those without it can continue working.“Many of the construction workers do not have smartphones. We are already facing a workforce scarcity at construction sites so we cannot make it compulsory for only those labourers who download the app to work,” a PWD official said, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/confusion-prevails-over-reopening-non-essential-industrial-pockets/story-fH94zcVbq6slLd0vjTWJtN.html

06-05-2020||Delhi||Two nabbed for selling fake travel forms to migrants||Delhi Police have arrested two people who allegedly duped migrants by selling them fake forms that they said will help facilitate their travel to their home states during the lockdown.Police officers on Wednesday made it clear that the government has not yet formulated any guidelines with regards to sending stranded migrant workers back to their hometowns and anyone claiming otherwise was not to be believed.The interrogation of the arretsed suspects so far has led the police to some WhatsApp groups on which fake forms were being circulated with the intention of duping poor migrant workers desperate to return to their homes.On Tuesday, a 38-year-old owner of a photocopying shop in outer Delhi’s Punjabi Colony near Narela was arrested for allegedly duping migrant workers by selling them fake forms, which he claimed would help them travel during the lockdown.Deputy commissioner of police (outer-north) Gaurav Sharma said that the shopkeeper, identified as Rajeev, was selling photocopies of the fake form to migrants living in Punjabi Colony at R20 each.“Rajeev was misleading them by asking them to deposit the filled forms at the police station. However, no such forms were issued by the Delhi police,” said DCP Sharma, adding that 25 copies of the fake form were seized from the shop. Rajeev admitted to having sold 20 such forms before his arrest.The shopkeeper was interrogated to know the source of the forms. He showed the police a WhatsApp group of which he was a member. Investigators said that they have approached the network service provider and sought details of the person who posted the fake form on the group.A similar arrest was made on May 1 in east Delhi’s Gandhi Nagar. The local police had received information that fake forms were being sold at a photocopying shop in Ajit Nagar area. The shop was raided and its owner, Mujahir Alam, was arrested. Alam told the police that he was only photocopying the form provided to him by some unknown migrant workers. In that case, as well, the police found that the fake form was being circulated on social media and various WhatsApp groups.“We hear migrants living in shelter homes often talking about such forms and the offers they get from outsiders that their travel back home can be arranged if they paid money. But we regularly warn them that such people are fraudsters and tell them that the government is preparing a list of people who want to return to their home states,” said Sujit, a member of Society for Promotion of Youth and Masses (SPYM), an NGO which manages several shelter homes in the city.In many of the recent meetings with a senior police officer, the Delhi Police Commissioner SN Shrivastava have asked them to keep a vigil on such fraudsters and rumour mongers, apart from updating migrants about the steps, the government is taking for their migration to home states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/two-nabbed-for-selling-fake-travel-forms-to-migrants/story-doSMIATZ9Uw0t9b3FNADKI.html

We do not expect too much footfall as lockdown measures are still in place, but the guards have been asked to ensure that patients maintain social distancing in all areas of the hospital,” a spokesperson from Safdarjung hospital said. The hospital had been running the clinics for patients who were already registered at the hospital.“Earlier, only those who were under the care of our doctors were being seen in the out-patient departments (OPDs) since social distancing norms had been put in place. Right now, the registration timings have been cut by one hour to ensure that social distancing is maintained in the hospital,” a doctor from the hospital said.This comes a day after Jain had raised the issue with union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan during a meeting on strategies to control vector-borne diseases on Tuesday.“I request that the central government dedicate one of its hospitals in Delhi for the treatment of Covid-19 patients and the others for non-Covid treatment. There have been cases of patients being refused routine treatment as all hospitals treat Covid-19 patients. Also, the 4,000-bed AllMS has dedicated the trauma centre and the cancer centre in Jhajjar for the treatment of Covid-19 patients, yet all other services at the main hospital are still halted. I urge you to restart the other facilities for non-Covid patients,” Jain said in the meeting.Dr Harsh Vardhan had responded that all the hospitals were treating patients and if any case of patients being refused treatment came to light, the central and state governments should discuss the matter with each other.The AIIMS said that a decision on when to restart the OPDs and routine surgeries has not been made yet, but consultation is being provided to already registered patients over the phone.“There are around 300 Covid-19 patients admitted to the trauma centre and AIIMS Jhajjar. Apart from that, there are about 1,100 to 1,200 other patients admitted to the main campus that has about 2,400 beds. These are patients who come to our emergency department and are usually in need of admission and surgeries. Some patients were admitted before the lockdown,” a senior doctor from the hospital said.Another doctor added, “AIIMS Jhajjar is also drawing staff from the main AIIMS campus and it is a big facility, so all services cannot be resumed immediately. Also to ensure that social distancing is followed, fewer than usual the number of patients are being admitted,” another doctor from the hospital said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/safdarjung-reopens-opds-for-new-patients/story-9eVkKbKsAn75krrka6BVQK.html

The single-judge bench of Justice Bharati Dangre while hearing the plea of Shekhar Sanadi, through video conferencing was informed by advocate Hrishikesh Mundargi that Sanadi was booked under sections 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt), 353 (punishment for assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and relevant provisions of Disaster Management Act, 2005 for placing his hand on the shoulder of the home guard.In light of the above Mundargi said that no offence was made out from the FIR filed by the police, hence Sanadi should be granted pre-arrest bail. However, public prosecutor Deepak Thakare opposed the plea.After hearing submissions, Justice Dangre observed, “On perusal of the FIR, prima facie what emerges is a verbal altercation between the complainant and the applicant while the latter was discharging his duty. No ingredients of Sections 323 and 353 of the IPC are made out of the complaint/FIR.While disposing of the application the bench restrained Sandi from making any inducement, threat, or attempt to persuade a person acquainted with the case from disclosing the facts to the court and not to tamper with the evidence.

It has also asked vend owners to facilitate home delivery of Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL), not more than two litres per order, between 1 pm to 6 pm, till the time curfew is in place.According to department guidelines issued on Wednesday, vend owners can book orders over phone and depute two employees for home delivery. Punjab Made Liquor (PML), or desi, would not be delivered home.As there is no provision for home delivery in the Punjab Excise Act, the state cabinet will approve the excise department’s order on Thursday. “We have completed all modalities for starting home delivery of liquor. We hope for a green signal from the cabinet also,” said additional excise and taxation commissioner Navdeep K Bhinder.“We will know a lot of things only after we take certain decisions, and then make needed rectifications,” Bhinder added.In the excise policy for 2020-21 that the state cabinet had approved in January this year, it was decided to start online sale (home delivery) of liquor as a pilot project in Mohali.All 5,800 liquor vends, except those in seven containment zones, are expected to open. Jalandhar and Patiala districts have two containment zones, with one each in Nawanshahr, Pathankot and Mohali.DCs and deputy excise and taxation commissioners will take decisions in their areas as the situation evolves. VEND OWNERS RELUCTANT,SEEK COMPENSATION With Thursday, the first day of opening this fiscal, vend owners are claiming a straight loss of 10% (Rs 620 crore of annual revenue target of Rs 6,200 crore based on the fixed quota system), saying that vends have already been shut for 36 days. Varinder Sharma, a liquor trader from Ludhiana said, “I, and many other traders, are not willing to open vends.” Anil Mahajan, who has stakes in liquor business in the Doaba region, said they were not in a position to open vends.Vend owners are also claiming compensation for loss of nine days of last fiscal, with the lockdown coming into force from March 23. The department has said that it would conduct stock verification first and any decision on losses would be taken later.— With inputs from Sachin Sharma in Bathinda||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/now-dial-to-get-your-favourite-booze-brand-in-punjab/story-ijFuNnnHv3qrMQ2ZdzzzCN.html

06-05-2020||Chandigarh||Now, get books delivered at doorstep in Chandigarh amid lockdown||On witnessing heavy rush outside bookstores after lockdown relaxations, the Chandigarh administration has now decided to permit owners to deliver books at the doorsteps. The decision came a day after the UT administration removed the odd-even policy for opening of bookstores in Chandigarh.UT administrator VP Singh Badnore had on Tuesday approved opening of stationary shops on all days in the city. However after observing heavy rush at the shops, the decision to deliver books at home was taken.A spokesperson of the UT administration said, “The decision of delivering books at home was taken to prevent overcrowding at the stores.” “Meanwhile, the administration has also cautioned parents to ensure precautionary measures such as sanitising books before giving them to kids while availing home delivery services,” he added.Chandigarh Parents Association (CPA) president Nitin Goyal said it was a welcome step while mentioning that the education department had failed to clarify the confusion over the NCERT books.Recently, there had been allegations by parents claiming that the city schools are forcing students to buy books from private publishers, which were available only with a few book sellers.Goyal said, “The high court, Chandigarh Commission for Protection of Child Rights (CCPCR) and the district education officer (DEO) have passed orders making NCERT books compulsory, but the private schools continue to prescribe books of private publishers. 40 complaints are pending in the DEO office and the administration is felicitating defiance of its own orders. The parents are now in a dilemma because of the confusion created by the education department.”Meanwhile, education secretary Arun Kumar Gupta also approved the proposal to distribute books to around 80,000 government school students from Classes 1 to 8 from the school premises itself.UT director of school education Rubinderjit Singh Brar said, “The distribution will start from Saturday. DEO has been authorised to carry out the distribution. The parents will be called to schools to collect the bundle of books class-wise while maintaining proper social distancing. The respective school principal and skeletal staff will carry out the work.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/now-get-books-delivered-at-doorstep-in-chandigarh-amid-lockdown/story-5pnrsxAyjTQgoUwKQsiHoI.html
06-05-2020||Mumbai||Matheran locals want vehicular restrictions lifted, HC asks MOEF to respond||The Bombay high court (HC) has directed the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MOEF) to respond to a petition which sought relaxation of vehicular restrictions in the ecologically sensitive zone of Matheran to ensure essential commodities reach the hill station.Matheran, which covers an area of 214.73 square kilometres, with an ecologically sensitive zone (ESZ) ranging between 0-200 metres around it, houses a population of 4,393 according to the 2011 census. In 2003, when Matheran was notified as an ecologically sensitive zone, motorised transport was prohibited in the hill station, and transport has since relied on porters, hand carts, and horse-drawn carts.The petition filed by Suresh Lad, a former NCP MLA, and local businessman Ajay Sawant, states that since the lockdown, porters were not available and residents were being forced to pay more for essential commodities.A single bench of justice SC Gupte, while hearing the petition through video conferencing on Tuesday, was informed that no vehicular movement, except for ambulances, fire tenders and tractor-drawn vehicles to collect solid waste were allowed in Matheran. The petitioner further stated that apart from the residents, there were around 25,000 tribals and farmers who lived in the vicinity of Matheran.In light of these submissions and the fact that heavy vehicles like trucks were allowed at the time of a crisis in 2005, the court directed the collector of Raigad district and the MoEF to relax the ESZ norms to allow small tempos to enter the town with essential commodities. Lawyers for the state and Centre said that they would have to take instructions from their relevant officers for the same. The court directed them to respond in a week and posted the matter for hearing after May 11.Umesh Dubal, owner of Gujarat Bhavan hotel at Matheran, said, “As owners of horse-drawn carts had withdrawn their services due to the lockdown, porters were charging a premium as they had to pull goods uphill. This was causing the prices of essential goods to increase. Hence, there was an urgent need to allow small vehicles to enter the town with some restrictions.”Faizan Mahapule who runs the Shabbir Biryaniwala outlet said that due to the lockdown, many tribal villagers who used to come to Matheran to work had stopped coming.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/matheran-locals-want-vehicular-restrictions-lifted-hc-asks-moef-to-respond/story-3VQNDfYK2Ldxen1xuWegjO.html

The city on Wednesday recorded a maximum temperature of 40 degrees Celsius and the highest maximum temperature of 44.9 degrees Celsius was reported at Akola (Vidarbha).The city will witness partly cloudy skies generally towards the afternoon throughout the week until May 10. The minimum temperatures will be at 24 degrees Celsius on May 7 and 8. On May 9 and 10, the maximum temperature is forecast to drop by one degrees Celsius.According to IMD, a western disturbance as a trough is likely to cause a cyclonic circulation over southwest Rajasthan, west Uttar Pradesh, east Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Bangladesh and east Vidarbha. There is also a possibility of trough/wind discontinuity from east Bihar to south interior Tamil Nadu over east Vidarbha that is causing low-pressure areas over south Andaman Sea and adjoining the southeast Bay of Bengal. However, the associated cyclonic circulation extending up to mid-tropospheric levels persists over the same region.“Day temperatures were appreciably above normal in some parts of Saurashtra and Kutch, central Maharashtra, north interior Karnataka, and above normal in some parts of Arunachal Pradesh, Konkan and Goa, Marathwada, Vidarbha, Telangana, Rayalaseema, Tamil Nadu, south interior Karnataka,” said an official from IMD.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-set-to-witness-rise-in-temperature-up-to-42-degrees-celsius-on-may-7-8-imd/story-Y6r4E9LwCEopTnjctnb29J.html
06-05-2020||City||Liquor vends to reopen in Ludhiana from May 7||With Punjab government ordering opening of liquor vends in the state from Thursday, Ludhiana liquor vend owners have marked circles outside their shops to maintain social distancing. According to the orders of the state government, only five customers will be allowed outside the shops at a time. There is also a provision to deliver liquor at the doorsteps of the residents, with maximum of two litres liquor per customer.The vends will remain open from 9am to 3pm, while home delivery will be entertained between 3pm and 6pm Curfew pass has been made mandatory for the staff of vends delivering alcohol at doorsteps, while delivery of liquor has been prohibited in containment zones.Taking lessons from other states, the district police have pulled up socks to deal with any chaos-like situation outside liquor vends. Commissioner of police Rakesh Agrawal said the police were prepared to tackle any such situation and were committed to execute the government’s orders. Meanwhile, the move has received mixed response from the public. Kulwant Singh of Sarabha Nagar said as the government had suffered huge monetary losses during the lockdown, it was forced to open liquor vends, which generated huge revenue. He cautioned that relaxation should be provided but the government should exercise maximum caution.Rajiv Sharma, a resident of Dugri, said the city was in the red zone, so the decision of opening liquor vends could backfire. The government should have waited for some more days before announcing the move, he added.HOME DELIVERY OF LIQUOR: CIVIL LINES RESIDENT LOSES ₹34,000 TO FRAUDSTERS Mukesh Kumar of Civil Lines on Wednesday lost ₹34,000 to fraudsters when he ordered a carton of scotch using a number advertised on Facebook offering home delivery of liquor at doorsteps. The trickster demanded ₹14,000 for the carton and asked him to make online payment using UPI. They demanded ₹4,000 in advance. Mukesh said after sometime the accused called him again and asked him to transfer another ₹10,000 claiming that the delivery boy was near his house.He said the accused made him make payments twice more, claiming that they had not received the amount and it had been credited to his account. He said by the time he realised he had been duped, the accused had already made him transfer ₹34,000. He has made a complaint to assistant commissioner of police (ACP, West) Sameer Verma stating that the Facebook page and numbers of the fraudsters are still active.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/liquor-vends-to-reopen-in-ludhiana-on-may-7/story-ooCmipTOmxwje4kbSGl7WL.html
06-05-2020||Chandigarh||Covid-19 lockdown hits college affiliation work at Panjab University||With work hit at Panjab University, Chandigarh, due to the Covid-19 lockdown, the process of granting affiliation to various colleges is in limbo this year.Panjab University (PU) has more than 190 affiliated colleges and over 100 colleges are granted temporary affiliation every year. Usually, the inspection committees of the university make visits to these colleges in April and May, following which reports are submitted to the PU syndicate.Even though the varsity had prepared for the inspections at different colleges, not a single visit has been possible ever since the lockdown started. PU’s former vice-chancellor ( V-C) Arun Kumar Grover said, “At this moment, the university authorities cannot afford to take any step that is not in the best interest of the students. They have an option to continue with the affiliations they had granted last year because a lot of students’ time has already been wasted due to the lockdown.”One of the syndicate members, professor Navdeep Goyal, said, “I think the university should extend the affiliations for one more year after it reopens,” adding, “Even if the temporary affiliations are continued, the impact of the lockdown is going to be more on the plans of the colleges to open new courses. “He further said that once the university reopens, the authorities can create a template that can be filled in by colleges before opening a new course. “Based on the information provided by colleges through the template, the PU syndicate can take a final decision,” he added.PU senator Inderpal Singh Sidhu, who is an assistant professor at Sri Guru Gobind Singh College, Sector 26, said, “Since the lockdown has disrupted the inspection process, it is advisable that colleges having affiliation in previous session are allowed to proceed further for new admissions in the upcoming session.”“The colleges which want to run new courses may apply online and send details to the university, following which they may be accorded provisional affiliation subject to the validation of documents submitted to the university,” he said.Dean college development council (DCDC), PU, Sanjay Kaushik, said, “We had made all the preparations for granting affiliations to colleges before the lockdown began. Now, once the university reopens, we will take a call with the due permission of the competitive authority.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/covid-19-lockdown-hits-college-affiliation-work-at-panjab-university/story-ptZxcVmbbTelG5UVCb5nxJ.html

Any laxity with regards to the directions will be seriously viewed and will invite action as per rules.”Even after repeated calls and messages, registrar Chandel did not respond to questions.A senior faculty member on the condition of anonymity said the gag orders clearly reflected insecurity among the management of NIPER.

IT companies located in Pimpri-Chinchwad police jurisdiction, which includes the Rajiv Gandhi Infotech Park at Hinjewadi has been allowed to call in 33 per cent of their staff as per orders issued by Sandeep Bishnoi, Pimpri-Chinchwad police commissioner on May 3, a day before lockdown 3.0 came into effect.Pune is one of the major IT hubs in the country with the IT Park at Hinjewadi alone, employing nearly two lakh people who reside mostly in the Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad civic areas. Annual software exports from the IT industry in Pune amounts to around $5 billion (Rs 10,000 crore), according to the Hinjewadi Industries Association.Vinayak Dhakane, deputy commissioner of police, zone-2, under whose jurisdiction the Hinjewadi IT park functions, said, “As employees are not allowed to commute to work by private vehicles, the bigger companies are now approaching us and making bus arrangements for the required number of employees who can come to work.”“By now, also their system of work-from-home has also developed,” he added.“One set of passes reached us in the morning and one at 6pm on Wednesday evening (total 263). The pass requires specific names of people travelling in a bus along with the route. The passes are being issued (by police) through HIA. If they had allowed for private vehicles for IT employees, that would been a more convenient option,” said Colonel (retired) Charanjeet Bhogal of the Hinjewadi Industries Association (HIA).Meanwhile, the Forum for IT Employees (FITE), a union for IT workers in Maharashtra, expressed the view that the employees should be called only after the lockdown is over or when Pune district, which is currently a red zone, comes to green or orange zone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/it-firms-prepare-to-start-operations-with-33-employees-in-lockdown-3-0/story-8gT3ei9UaD9Rs5Y2NLKIsL.html

The case was registered against JS Kandial of Vikas Nagar and five others, including women, on the complaint of Jagjit Singh Sahi, the executive officer (EO) of Nayagaon municipal council.In his complaint the EO said that Mangal Singh had approached the police with a complaint that Kandial and others had constructed a wall on the road from Adarsh Nagar to Guggamadi. The road had been in use for nearly two decades, but Kandial had closed the road by constructing a wall, which posed great inconvenience to residents.The EO in his complaint said that when a nagar council team went to the spot to clear the road, Kandial and the other accused attacked Mangal and disrupted the team from demolishing the wall.On the EO’s statement, police have registered a case under Sections 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 431 (mischief by injury to public road, bridge, river or channel), 447 (punishment for criminal trespass) and 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant ) of IPC in Nayagaon police station.It may be mentioned that a few residents of the area had also taken to social media against the demolition of the wall, saying it was constructed to prevent unwarranted entry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/6-nayagaon-residents-booked-for-disrupting-demolition-of-illegal-wall/story-Z6IKI4ir1I7hLn50tca3hJ.html

Had the state government made proper arrangements of food and shelter for these people on time, their exodus could have been avoided,” he remarked, adding that the state government should start working soon on suggestions given by him.He said added that the county might face its worst recession as the economy had been dealt a big blow. “If the government fails to take necessary steps to boost economy and employment, the future would be quite scary,” Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/new-cases-in-himachal-ex-cm-raises-concern-claiming-negligence-on-admn-s-behalf/story-uJbBxFfjCxF6QvbCaaffiP.html

06-05-2020||Pune||Stranded labourers in Pune restless, desperate to travel back home||Stranded migrant workers living in labour camps across Pune expect a long battle for a chance to travel back home, but restlessness and desperation has kicked in.Despite government agencies and NGOs providing them with adequate food and shelter, the labourers don’t want to stay in Pune any longer due to the fear of the spread of the Sars-Cov-2 virus which causes the Covid-19 infection. Ashok Das who is staying at a labour camp in Katraj said that he and his friends are from West Bengal and want to travel back home to their village. “We are stuck in Pune due to the lockdown. Besides food packets, we are not getting any proper facilities in the labour camp, each passing day has become difficult for us, so we want to go back home now,” Das said. One of the primary hurdles, the migrant labourers face, is getting a medical certificate from an authorised health professional. According to Vaishali Patkar, president of the Aundh Vikas Mandal which is working in the interest of migrant labourers in the city, the number of people wanting to avail the certificate is huge. “There are technical issues which the labourers are facing while filling up the form online, while some of them do not have Aadhar card and are not able to register. For others, there is a lot of confusion over the orders issued by various government agencies, which needs to be clarified,” Patkar said. Another activist, Keshav Mandhare from Katraj believes that the conditions inside the labour camps are not good. “Though they are getting regular food, but all of them are worried about their future stay in Pune. Now most of them have applied to go back to their states, they want the government to arrange a train for them and also provide safety. We are trying our best to help them out, but their patience is now spiralling,” Mandhare said. Credai Pune Metro has been helping migrant workers in all possible ways and providing food, but since the labourers do not have work, they have become restless, according to Suhas Merchant, president of Credai Pune Metro. “Since there is no work on the construction site, naturally these workers want to go back home. How long can builders sustain in this crisis situation? There is a need of proper coordination between different governing bodies like municipal corporations, police department, district administration and others, as everyone issues different orders. So we are not able to start the construction work,” Merchant said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/stranded-labourers-in-pune-restless-desperate-to-travel-back-home/story-oosR7qGVDrexzLa2o4nxqI.html

Dr Rawat, who has been conducting online yoga classes through DMCH’s official website since April, says he has so far taken three sessions of 30 to 40 minutes each comprising 39 asanas.“In my next class that will possibly go live within a week, I will largely focus on the lifestyle changes that one needs to adopt for leading a stress free and calm life,” he informs.The senior consultant says yoga asanas activate neurons that alleviate stress and also relax body muscles that tighten because of stress.He says while yoga nidra (also known as shavasana) helps in cases with cardiac disease, stress and hypertension by relaxing body tissues, asanas such as katichakraasana, udarakarshanasana, surya namaskar, vajrasana, mandukaasana and pawanmuktaasana help in enhancing overall strength and flexibility and are also effective in healing pulmonary diseases.“Pranayama that are practised after yoga nidra and other asanas are also important aspects of yoga. Pranayama like nadi shodhana helps in removing blockages in all 72,000 nerves in the body,” he adds.Dr Rawat suggests ‘dhai ghadi’, 35 minutes before and after sunrise, as the perfect time for performing yoga as nostrils are most active during these times allowing breathing exercises effectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/started-online-yoga-class-to-help-people-beat-anxiety-stress-during-lockdown-ludhiana-hospital-consultant/story-sArJwTLXlNLPiS8ewZqG9I.html

Keeping the current situation in mind, the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) has come up with a new method to continue the approval process for new colleges without delay.In a statement released on Wednesday, the council has clarified that requirement of documents remains same to previous few years. “We have devised online scrutiny of documents and virtual institute inspections in order to proceed with approval of new colleges. This process can’t be further delayed so we had to come up with a viable solution,” said Anil Sahasrabuddhe, chairman, AICTE. He added that the online scrutiny will be at par with any physical scrutiny that institutes have been put through in the past.In the last two years, growing vacancy in both engineering and pharmacy institutes pushed the council to implement a ban on new technical and pharmacy institutes across the country. However, this ban was relaxed in districts with no government-funded institute as well as those institutes who have been applying for approval since before the ban was implemented.“Institutes are free to apply for approval but we will scrutinising every detail before any decision comes through. This year we have received maximum applications for new management colleges,” added Sahasrabuddhe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/aicte-starts-online-scrutiny-of-documents-for-fast-approval-of-new-engineering-institutes/story-pAdnTH1tJBS5EqmlJ8FnfK.html

The bar body had received 3,400 applications for financial help. The Covid-19 relief fund for advocates has been set up on the lines of Delhi and Goa bar council.A 26-year-old advocate living in Phase 1, Mohali, said he had just started his career. “However, courts are closed so I have not been able to earn. But I am expected to pay my rent and meet other expenses. I need assistance to tide over this tough time,” said the young lawyer, unwilling to be named.“I have been getting about 10 to 12 calls from lawyers seeking help. With courts not working, it is become difficult for them, so I decided to take up the issue,” said Manpreet Singh Chahal, president of Mohali DBA. Chahal said he had written to the bar council and is urging other bar associations to step forward and help lawyers.“The conditions imposed for availing help must be relaxed so that a larger number of lawyers can be helped,” said Chahal, who is also seeking to increasing the amount.Courts have been closed for more than 40 days now and some advocates who were living hand to mouth have been rendered without income. Of 600 DBA members, 25 applications for help were filed by advocates who could meet the criteria.For an advocate to qualify for financial help, he should be active and have a regular legal practice at the bar. The advocate must be unable to earn due to the lockdown. He/she should not be receiving any monthly payment from another advocate with whom he/she is practising as a junior. No one in his/her family must be getting a monthly salary from any government or statuary body or organisation, and neither should any member of his/her family be getting a pension.

A senior officer of the Northern Command, requesting anonymity, said every time Pakistan indulges in mischief, it is given a stinging punch in the face. “They had no locus-standi in the past but after nullification of J&K’s special status, Pakistan Army has been indulging in desperate attacks on security forces and intense shelling on the borders,” he said. In a recent report, the Intelligence Bureau had stated that there were 16 operational launch pads across the LoC that are ready to push 450 terrorists into J&K. However, there was a lull for over six months after the August 5 move. The senior official attributed it to Pakistan’s internal problems. “They were under pressure from FATF and then Imran Khan’s government got into a confrontation with General Bajwa. Our mountain passes were also closed due to snow. The lull can be attributed to multiple factors,” he said. “We lost eight security personnel in two incidents but they cannot sum up and define the entire scenario. We are constantly maintaining pressure on militants and retaliating strongly to shelling and firing by Pakistan Army along the LoC,” he said. Major General (retired) GS Jamwal said, “Pakistan is fast losing what they call their jugular vein—Kashmir—after the abrogation of Article 370. Therefore, they are now resorting to all sorts of desperate measures.” “They want to keep the Kashmir issue alive and they know how to grab attention of the international community, including Islamic countries, by staging terror attacks and flaring up borders with India and then blaming us,” he said. He also anticipated more terror attacks in future. “We should continue to maintain pressure on terrorists and ensure that we don’t lose our men but inflict maximum damage on them,” he said. Pak army resorts to firing along LoC in Poonch Pakistan Army on Wednesday resorted to firing on forward areas along the Line of Control (LoC) in two sectors of Jammu and Kashmir’s Poonch district, drawing retaliation from Indian soldiers, a defence spokesperson said. “Around 3:40pm, Pakistan Army initiated unprovoked ceasefire violation by firing with small arms along LoC in Shahpur sector,” the spokesperson said. Cross-border shelling between the two sides was going on when last reports were received, officials said. However, there was no immediate report of any casualty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/art-370-revocation-increased-attacks-on-forces-intense-shellling-a-sign-that-pak-is-desperate/story-I6vCF1UgPeomZcWuItvnwJ.html

The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC)-run hospital has been authorised to issue health certificates to labourers after checking them for any Covid-19 symptoms. The large crowd in front of the Aundh hospital also consisted of women and children. Laltidevi, a woman from Chappra in Bihar said she came to Pune for a court hearing after her husband died, but has been stuck in the city for over 2 months. “I had come for 10 days for a court hearing after my husband died while working at a site in Pune. They had called me to collect the insurance money, now it’s been two months since I’ve been stuck here,” she said. There are several others along with Laltidevi who belong to Chappra in Bihar. Most of them, walked 12 kilometers from Sutarwadi, Pashan area to Aundh. “We started early at 6am to beat the queue,” said Nasseruddin Khan, clutching his copy of the Aadhar card and the travel form close to him.“Can we get some food? We haven’t had anything to eat since last night. There was no ration and we are all hungry,” he said, pointing to his fellow labourers.According to Khan, the workers who walked with him were either working at construction sites or were involved in odd jobs like painting and denting in the Balewadi, Baner area. Khan was working on painting interiors and was half way into his contract when the lockdown was announced. He did not get his full payment and now has to return home without the money. “I have a family back in Chappra and they must be worried about me. Hence, I came here as early as 7am to beat this queue. The faster, I get my medical certificate, the sooner I can go home,” Khan said. Not everyone in the queue was from Bihar, Vijaya Khidki, a resident of Buldhana, was visiting her son who works at a grocery store in the city. “I want to go back to my hometown, I had come for a short visit and now I am stuck here. Both my son and I, are leaving Pune at the earliest,” she said.The husband of a pregnant woman in the crowd asked NV Swami, senior pharmacy officer, incharge of the coordination for issuance of the medical certificate whether he will be allowed to travel to Sangli with his 9-month pregnant wife.Swami asks him to stay in Pune and takes another set of questions posed by labourers. “We will first take the temperature and check for any Covid-19 symptoms, only when they are clear will they be issued a medical certificate. We will keep a copy of the certificate and a copy of their Aadhaar card with the mobile number. We started this two days ago, there weren’t so many people at first. The influx of workers has increased three-fold today and I was informed by the security that people have been waiting since 3am outside the gate,” Swami said. The hospital opens at 8.30am and is open until 1pm every day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/migrant-labourers-queue-for-hours-outside-aundh-hospital-to-get-their-medical-certificates/story-w65GSZcnaeKSuTZKwTiD0N.html

He said that production of packaging materials, which has been been stalled since March, should be started in industrial areas like Baddi, Kala Amb and Nalagarh by taking precautionary measures to ensure safety of the workers.He also urged the state government to make arrangements for labourers, 90% of whom have come to the state’s apple growing belt from Nepal, besides demanding to set up a high-level monitoring committee under the CM’s chairmanship to redress farmers’ issues.The state government should fix minimum support price in order to provide relief to the farmers, while support prices should also be increased as cost of production of apples have gone up, he said.The former Congress MLA asked the CM to waive off loans of small and marginal farmers and revise budget 2020-21 to prioritise health and agricultural sector as the situation has changed since the budget was approved.In addition to it, Thakur suggested opening of controlled atmosphere stores and fruit processing units so that farmers could store their produce safely and sell it at reasonable rates. He also demanded compensation for the loss suffered by farmers and horticulturists due to hailstorm.Thakur has also called for strengthening of public distribution system in the state, besides provision of free ration for poor and needy persons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/former-mla-rohit-thakur-discusses-farmers-issues-with-himachal-cm/story-4UmZxSXyaRvZAx6jj9DoMI.html

06-05-2020||Pune||Lockdown puts warkaris’ annual procession in limbo||The Covid-19 pandemic has cast an uncertainty over this year’s Ashadhi palkhi procession of the warkaris, their annual pilgrimage.At least 15 lakh people from the state participate in the annual procession from Alandi and Dehu to Pandharpur, making it the largest pilgrimage in Maharashtra. However, with the extension of the lockdown and a ban on all kinds of religious gathering, the warkaris who are set to begin the procession on June 12 have sought clarity from government.Organisers of the Sant Dynaneshwar Maharaj palkhi said they want the state government to clarify how the wari should proceed this year, given that at least 15 lakh people gather at Pandharpur.Rambhau Chopdar, trustee, Sant Dynaneshwar Maharaj Palkhi samiti, said that the procession is scheduled to begin in less than a month. The wari will begin with the departure for Muktai’s palkhi from Alandi on May 27, while two other palkhis of Sant Dnyaneshwar and Sant Tukaram will depart from Alandi and Dehu on June 13 and June 12 respectively. However due to lockdown, the preparations are stalled, delaying the procession.“We have dindis (small groups of warkaris) coming in from across Maharashtra and everyone is keen on beginning the procession as per schedule, but there is no clarity whether they will be allowed to do so. The government must find solutions to keep the centuries-old tradition uninterrupted,” said Chopdar.He added that there are not many days left for preparations as people are confined to their homes, given the nationwide lockdown. “The Muktai’s palkhi is scheduled to leave from Alandi in 22 days and the Sant Dynaneshwar’s palkhi is scheduled to leave in 38 days. However, there has been no response from the government regarding Maharashtra’s largest pilgrimage. We appeal to the Government to suggest the way forward. We are aware that this year the wari may not be such a big event due to the Covid-19 pandemic but we need an answer from the authorities to take the next step,” said Chopdar.About the pilgrimageWari is the annual pilgrimage from Alandi to Pune to Pandharpur which takes place in the Hindu month of Aashadh around June- July. Lakhs of devotees walk the 250 km route.

So we are looking for alternate options of railway stations like Daund, Uruli and Loni where currently survey of the station is going on by our officials,” Pune district collector Naval Kishore Ram said. He said the process of registering workers for this train was going on. Once the journey date is finalised, they will be taken to the railway station, at least two to three hours in advance for a final check and would be provided with meals and water bottles. “It is yet to be decided as to who will bear their ticket cost,” he said.Pune divisional railway manager (DRM) Renu Sharma said the railways is ready to run the special train on any given day and time. “Once we get the consent and list of passengers from the Pune district administration the special train will run from Pune railway division with all the safety and precautionary measures,” she said.A senior official from the Pune district administration said that thousands of applications have been received from migrant workers who want to travel towards North India. Accordingly, the first train has been planned to Bhopal. Around 1,200 passengers will travel in this train.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-bhopal-train-for-migrant-workers-on-the-anvil-district-collector/story-hPMt08TqxRYkLU2ZzxLrlK.html
06-05-2020||Delhi||Constable dies of Covid-19, first case in Delhi Police||A Delhi Police constable, posted at Bharat Nagar police station in northwest district, died of coronavirus disease Covid-19 on Tuesday evening.The test result from a private lab confirmed on Wednesday afternoon that the 31-year-old had Covid-19.This is the first case of a Delhi Police personal succumbing to Covid-19. “The result from a private lab has returned positive. We are still awaiting the result from RML Hospital,” said a senior police officer who didn’t want to be identified.Constable Amit Kumar belonged to Sonepat in Haryana where his wife and three-year-old son live. Kumar himself lived with a friend on the fifth floor of a rented home in Gandhi Nagar, a neighbourhood close to Bharat Nagar where he worked.“Kumar was into crime data liaisoning. It didn’t require him to frequently visit the police station or interact with most other colleagues,” said the officer.In the early hours of Monday, Kumar woke up from his sleep and complained of breathing problems. One of his colleagues said that he was provided warm water and when his condition did not improve, he was taken to Dr BR Ambedkar Hospital.“There, he was neither admitted, nor tested for Covid-19,” alleged a colleague. A response from the hospital is awaited. He was then taken to Deep Chand Bandhu Hospital where he was given some medicines and referred for Covid-19 testing. He underwent testing in Ashok Vihar before returning home. “Later he again complained of discomfort and was taken to RML Hospital where he was declared brought dead,” said a statement issued by the police.

06-05-2020||Delhi||Less than 10% of migrant workers in shelter homes want to return home: Govt official||Less than 10% of migrant workers—around 680 of around 7,100—who have taken shelter in the 240-odd centres operated by the Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB), want to head back to their home states at the earliest, a senior government official said Tuesday, citing a report submitted by the Board to the chief secretary’s office.The report, however, does not include the final application status of around 10,000 more migrant workers who have taken shelter in centres operated by the revenue district administrations across the city, which range from school buildings and community halls to sports complexes. A separate report on that is awaited later this week, the senior government official said.The official further said that the data also does not include results of an online application process that has been launched focussing on stranded individuals (migrant workers, students, pilgrims and tourists) who have not taken shelter in any of the DUSIB or district adminstration-run centres and are still believed to be scattered across the city. Their numbers are unknown, at least on paper. In all the centres where migrants have taken shelter, both under the jurisdiction of the DUSIB and the district administration, application forms were distributed between April 30 and May 2, following the central government’s directions to allow states to arrange for interstate movement of stranded migrant workers, students, pilgrims and tourists through buses and trains.On Tuesday, HT spoke to 10 of the applicants from the DUSIB list. Six of them said that they were in Delhi temporarily for construction work and their job was done but they could not return home because of the lockdown. The remaining four said that they had no permanent job in the city and wanted to head back home because they were unsure of their source of livelihood in the days to come.The forms will be further scrutinised by the government. On Sunday, the Union home ministry told the states that the transport scheme was not meant for workers who intend to visit home, but for those in distress because they had been caught unawares by the lockdown, emphasising the word “stranded” mentioned in the directives issued on April 29.“The facility is for those who had come to work temporarily and had to return to their home states immediately after, but could not do so because of the lockdown… It is not for those who have been (already) staying in the state and working for six months or one year,” deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said.At least in the DUSIB centres, the majority of migrant workers have started to have second thoughts now, especially after job opportunities opened up a bit this week. The scaling down of the lockdown measures has paved the way for some business and commercial activities to resume in the Capital despite all its 11 revenue districts categorised as red zones“A phased revival of the industrial and construction sectors matters the most,” Animesh Das, labour activist and member of Delhi government’s minimum wages board, said.Das further said: “A large number of workers is scared of what would happen if they went back home and could not return to the city for a long time. There are no jobs in the towns and villages either. Also, if they returned later, what is the guarantee that there would be jobs for them in the city? There is extreme confusion that is adding to their anxieties.”Bipin Rai, a member of the DUSIB, said: “We will ensure all necessary checks for applicants who want to leave for their home states. For those who stay back, we will continue to ensure food and shelter.”“The highest number of applicants (from the DUSIB centres) are from Uttar Pradesh (around 40%), followed by Bihar (around 35%). Applicants from other states include West Bengal, Punjab, Rajasthan, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh and Jharkhand,” Rai said.Sisodia further emphasised on “confidence-building measures” taken by the government.The Delhi government on Sunday issued a standard operating procedure (SOP) for the movement of stranded migrant workers, tourists, pilgrims and students in adherence to the central government’s orders. The SOP directed government officials and the police to join hands to compile a database of the numbers of those stranded, so they could be sent back to their home states, and “encourage” them to download the Aarogya Setu mobile application.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/less-than-10-of-migrant-workers-in-shelter-homes-want-to-return-home-govt-official/story-Z4zAyZUwV6b01tBmNkkHSN.html

The patient was the second Covid-19 fatality in the state.The victim’s body could only be cremated at midnight as the district administration and municipal corporation authorities passed the buck over making necessary arrangements. Municipal corporation officials refused to cremate the body on ground of it not being part of the protocol. However, they did sanitise the hospital and the route between the hospital and the cremation ground. Municipal corporation commissioner Pankaj Rai said, “It was not our duty to cremate the body as it is not unclaimed. It was registered at the hospital. The instructions in this regard are clear in the central government’s advisory. The corporation staff sanitised the cremation ground again in the morning.” Since the victim’s relatives had been quarantined, the body lay unclaimed in the hospital. Finally, it was the hospital authorities that made arrangements for the disposal of the body. Senior medical superintendent Dr Janak Raj said, “I had informed the authorities concerned as soon as the patient died. It was the hospital, which had to make arrangements to cremate the body in the end.” “The hospital staff and I accompanied the body to cremation ground,” Raj said. The body was kept in the mortuary before it was cremated. “I cannot afford to risk the lives of my staff, patients, and others visiting the hospital,” Raj said. The body was transported to crematorium in Kanlog at mid-night. The hospital staff wore PPE kits. Sub-divisional magistrate (urban) Neeraj Chandla also reached the cremation ground. She and the priest performed the last rites and remained at the cremation ground till midnight. Notably, the priest who performed the last rites did not wear the PPE kit. The victim had also been suffering from a kidney ailment. He had travelled from New Delhi to Mandi’s Sarkaghat. The patient was first taken to Lal Bhadur Shastri Medical College in Mandi district. However, after his condition deteriorated, he was referred to IGMC, Shimla.He reached the hospital at around 3.30am on Tuesday and passed away around 5.50pm. The patient had tested positive for the coronavirus disease both at IGMC and Lal Bhadur Shastri Medical College.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/himachal-reports-second-covid-19-fatality-as-21-year-old-patient-succumbs-in-shimla/story-8IHfOqU7t66kyQO32zRAMJ.html
06-05-2020||Delhi||Admin of Bois Locker Room chat group, where schoolboys planned rapes, arrested||The administrator of Bois Locker Room, a controversial Instagram group where schoolboys discussed raping their classmates, has been arrested by the cyber crime cell of the Delhi Police.This is the second arrest by the police which took suo motu cognisance of the happenings in the group after screenshots were shared on social media and registered a case. A 15-year-old boy was earlier apprehended after questioning.Investigators said the group had 22 members in all, and two of them were adults studying in colleges. At least 20 of them are studying in at least four prominent schools in Delhi-NCR, they further said.On Tuesday, 10 members were questioned over phone.The devices of the identified members of the group have been seized and sent for forensic analysis.The cyber crime unit has asked for information about the alleged group and its members from Facebook-owned social networking platform Instagram. Their reply is awaited, an official said.The role of other members is being ascertained, said investigators.The content on the group included a remark by one member who suggested collecting a group of boys to gang rape a classmate, and several photos of schoolgirls that were accompanied with texts objectifying them. There were also copies of photos posted by girls on Instagram that were then appended with lewd and violent remarks.The conversations were exposed after one of the boys in the group took screenshots and passed it on to someone else, said the officer, before it was posted on social media by one of the girls who was targeted.The police have invoked sections of the Information Technology Act and the Indian Penal Code dealing with the distribution of pornographic content and making objectionable remarks about women.On Monday, authorities of one of the schools – where the whistleblower student studied - filed a complaint with the Delhi Police. “Once the screenshots emerged in the public domain, the group was deleted and another one created. Some girls were added in the new group to mislead police,” said an investigator.The original group was created in early April, the investigator quoted above said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/admin-of-instagram-group-bois-locker-room-arrested-devices-seized/story-9tQDaF32QglX2tnyGPP6wI.html

Sri CM Nitish Kumar has asked Sri Piyush Goyal to intervene on this regressive move.”Tagging the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), Jha further tweeted, “CM Nitish Kumar has written a letter on May 1 to Railway Minister PiyushGoyal requesting him to immediately rescind this decision. IRIMEE represents rich legacy of Railways and Bihar. Its great historical linkage with Bihar needs to be strengthened and not severed.” #जमालपुर स्थित इंडियन रेलवे के इस सबसे पुराने केन्द्रीय संस्थान से न सिर्फ बिहार के लोगों का बल्कि भारतीय रेल के हजारों लोगों व् अधिकारीयों का भावनात्मक जुड़ाव रहा है. @NitishKumar जी के 1 मई को लिखे पत्र के आलोक में रेलमंत्री @PiyushGoyal जी से तत्काल हस्तक्षेप का अनुरोध है।The National General Secretary, JD(U) further stated, “This oldest central training institute has been an iconic institution, and a pride of Bihar. Estblished in 1888, IRIMEE Jamalpur has been most coveted center for training to Indian Railway’s top brains since 1927. How can a legacy of 93 years be wiped off so brazenly?”“In 2015, Bihar urged Centre to upgrade IRIMEE into a University. It was informed that instead National Academy of Railway, Vadodara was being upgraded as 1st national university and IRIMEE shall operate under this new univ. Now, this move to shift it is unacceptable @PiyushGoyal,” he tweeted.“The rather intriguing move of shifting is shocking. IRIMEE Jamalpur is integral to rich legacy of Bihar and CM Nitish Kumar takes great pride in this. We earnestly request Sri Piyush Goyal to intervene and ensure rescinding of this outrageous order,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/bihar-minister-requests-piyush-goyal-to-revoke-order-shifting-railway-institute/story-4wE91DmgWA48bct9zJcKYK.html

Before the order was withdrawn, Panjab University senator Subhash Sharma told Hindustan Times that the university should reconsider this move.‘INHUMANE MOVE’He said, “This step is inhumane and insensitive and I strongly condemn it. There are clear instructions from the government not to retrench any employee. The university should reconsider this move.”Usually, employees continue their service once the academic session ends and in many cases those hired on contract or temporarily are re-engaged after a one-day break at the end of the academic session. However, questions were raised as the university said the employees will be re-engaged once the university resumes functioning.CRITICISM FROM ALL CORNERSIt is learnt that college development council (DCDC) dean professor Sanjay Kaushik, who was also a member of the committee, had opposed the move.Kaushik, reportedly, wrote a letter to dean university instructions (DUI) professor RK Singla criticising the move. The issue was also raised in the online group of PU senators.Panjab University senator professor Rajat Sandhir said, “Raising questions on the appointment of temporary and guest faculty in the present scenario when people are already facing multiple anxieties is not right. The university has finally taken the right step by withdrawing it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/deluge-of-criticism-forces-pu-to-withdraw-retrenchment-orders-within-hours/story-8yeWLxTMQ5cIDbbCrXKBeM.html
06-05-2020||Chandigarh||In corona times, Punjab to start online sale, home delivery of liquor from tomorrow||PATIALA: The Punjab excise department will start the online order and home delivery of liquor across the state from Thursday .The decision coincides with the opening of liquor vends in the state from 9am to 1pm on Thursday. The sale at the vends will be allowed only during the stipulated hours.The cabinet, chaired by chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh, will put its stamp on the excise department’s order at its meeting on Thursday morning.“We have completed all modalities related to starting the home delivery of liquor. We are hopeful that the department will get the green signal from state cabinet to go ahead with it,” said Navdeep Bhinder, Punjab’s additional excuse and taxation commissioner. HOME DELIVERY ONLY DURING CURFEW A senior official said the decision was taken after seeing long queues and chaos outside liquor vends in others states and neighbouring Chandigarh. “The department has come up with a better idea of home delivery,” he said. “The approval from the cabinet is a mere formality. All prerequisites related to this move have already been completed as the state excise department has already directed deputy commissioners, excise officials and liquor vendors to go ahead with the plan,” an official said.Meanwhile, Bhinder said the home delivery services will be provided only till the enforcement of curfew in the state.“The home delivery of liquor will also help to follow mandatory social distancing norms. Though there is no provision of home delivery in the Punjab Excise Act, but the decision has been taken temporarily in the wake of the situation arising due to Covid-19,” Bhinder said.VENDORS NOT TO SELL MORE THAN 2LITRE/ORDERThe liquor vendors have been directed not to sell more than two litres of liquor per order.“The stringent directions have been issued to vendors across the state regarding home delivery. They have to maintain the order book on a daily basis, while only two persons will be allowed to deliver liquor to customers per liquor vend,” Bhinder said.The state is expected to earn a revenue of Rs 6,200 crore in the 2020-21 financial year. However, the sale of liquor is largely affected due to the countrywide lockdown, denting revenue figures of the excise department.In the excise policy for the financial year 2020-21, this is for the first time that the department will experiment with the online sale and delivery of liquor despite criticism from opposition parties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/in-corona-times-punjab-to-start-online-sale-home-delivery-of-liquor-from-tomorrow/story-JLqiibMI63XlmJotAaJTBM.html

06-05-2020||Latest||Will evaluate if ‘The Hundred’ approaches us for investment: KKR CEO Mysore||Kolkata Knight Riders CEO Venky Mysore did not entirely rule out the possibility of the popular IPL franchise “evaluating” investment opportunities in England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB)’s ambitious franchise league ‘The Hundred’, which had to be shelved this year due to COVID-19 pandemic. British newspaper ‘The Telegraph’ on Tuesday quoted Mysore saying that they would surely be keen to “explore” investment opportunities in The Hundred.However the KKR CEO was categorical that at this moment it’s nothing more than speculations. “I know this story is going around. All I said was ‘if we are approached to consider investing in ‘The Hundred’, we will evaluate it’,” Mysore told PTI, reacting to the report in the English daily.Owned by Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan, the two-time IPL champions had in 2015 acquired Caribbean Premier League side Trinidad & Tobago Red Steel, who are now known as Trinbago Knight Riders, a winner of successive CPL titles in 2017 and 2018. They also had acquired a third team, the Cape Town franchise in Cricket South Africa’s Global T20 league which however did not see the light of the day and was cancelled in 2017.“We are the biggest brand in IPL and perhaps the only global brand in cricket. So we can understand why leagues around the world would be interested in getting Knight Riders on board,” Mysore said. A brainchild of the ECB, The Hundred will be 100-balls-per-side format and will be played by eight franchises rather than the established 18 first-class counties.It was slated for a July start but only to be pushed till 2021 with ECB grappling in financial crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.According to ECB chief executive Tom Harrison, they are slated to incur a loss of over GBP 300 million, if the upcoming season is wiped out due to the COVID-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cricket/will-evaluate-if-the-hundred-approaches-us-for-investment-kkr-ceo-mysore/story-GHUTyjtIF5E9xw2yAOFKfI.html

06-05-2020||Lucknow||With restricted evaluation, UP Board results unlikely soon||With the state government allowing evaluation of UP Board’s class 10 and class 12 answer sheets at evaluation centres located in green zones only, results are now expected in July, say teachers and former board officials alike.Although serving UP Board officials are not willing to comment, they also feel results before July seem very unlikely amid the ongoing situation owing to Covid-19 pandemic.“The evaluation started in mere 63 centres in the 20 districts that are in green zone from Tuesday. There is uncertainty as to when evaluation in the remaining 212 centres in the districts that are in red and orange zones will start,” shared a senior UP Board official.UP Board secretary Neena Srivastava confirmed that evaluation process started in the evaluation centres located in districts which are in green zone but expressed her inability to comment on either when the evaluation could start in remaining districts or when the results would be declared.However, board officials claim that it was unlikely that situation will normalise even when the third phase of the lockdown ends on May 17 and this meant that even after May 17 the evaluation was not expected to start in many districts. Moreover, with the state government making it clear that proper social distancing norms is to be followed at evaluation centres, the board also faces problem in deputing all 1.46 lakh teachers that it had initially deputed for the evaluation of more than 3.10 crore answer sheets. “This also means that the process would require 15 to 20 days. So if the evaluation continues till first week of June even then the results would get declared only by first or second week of July as a major part of the result finalisation work is undertaken in Delhi where too coronavirus has impacted routine functioning,” said another senior board official.Teacher MLC (Allahabad-Jhansi division) Suresh Kumar Tripathi said prevailing situation and past experience point to the fact that the UP Board results could now be expected only in July.Agrees former UP Board secretary and former director (secondary education) Basudev Yadav. He said evaluation of answer sheets in all districts before end of the lockdown was impossible as ensuring strict social distancing was a tough ask. He also pointed out that even teachers who are to undertake the evaluation in orange and red zones too were not ready to be part of the process owing to safety concerns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/with-restricted-evaluation-up-board-results-unlikely-soon/story-5DwJyWz3SiDjUQDJ7B0ATN.html

06-05-2020||Lucknow||24 cases in two days: Veggies come at a premium as Meerut mandi closed for 3 days||Two dozen Covid 19 cases inside the vegetable mandi in the past two days have thrown a scare among traders as well as buyers. The scared vegetable traders decided to not open their shops inside the mandi at least for three days from Tuesday, which compelled authorities to shift the mandi to some suitable alternate places so that the supply chain could be maintained.On the other hand, people began hoarding vegetables in their houses, anticipating a hike in prices due to the prevailing uncertainty over supply.Poonam Sharma, a housewife, said, “I have stored onion, potato and green vegetables at least for over a week because prices will go up following closure of the mandi.” Her apprehension was not unfounded. She lives in Ganga Nagar locality where more than a dozen vendors took rounds to sell vegetables. But on Tuesday, a day after 24 people tested positive, barely two vendors hawked vegetables priced at least 25 to 30 per cent higher than the previous day. A vegetable vendor said, “Passes issued to vendors and other traders were cancelled and only a few vendors somehow managed to procure vegetables.”Secretary of Naveen Mandi Narendra Singh said that scared traders refused to open their shops on Tuesday and authorities were now searching for some suitable location where the mandi could function at least for three days while intensive sanitisation was launched on the mandi premises.Singh said that passes issued to traders and vendors had been cancelled and new passes would be issued after shifting the mandi to new locations. He said, “The idea is to operate vegetable and fruit mandi from two to three locations so that the crowd may be controlled easily”. City magistrate Satyendra Kumar Singh candidly admitted that it was a mammoth task to maintain supply of vegetables and fruits under the prevailing situation. He said, “Vegetables being an essential commodity, we are doing everything possible to resolve the problem”. Ashok Sonkar, president of Naveen Mandi Vegetable Traders’ Association, is under home quarantine after a person working next to his shop tested positive. Sonkar, who has been in this trade for over two decades, said, “ We never witnessed such a situation. Traders are scared and farmers are destroying their vegetable crop in fields instead of coming to the mandi. Everyone, including the state government, would suffer huge losses. “He demanded intensive sanitisation inside the mandi and a plan in consultation with traders to maintain supply of vegetables in the district.Sarfaraj Ansari, secretary of Naveen Mandi Vegetable Traders Association, said that the mandi had over 150 wholesale traders and approximate 3,500 to 4,000 vendors sold vegetables in every nook and corner of the city. The district had consumption of one truckload of potato, onion and tomato each, as well as approximately 4,000 quintals of green vegetables, he said. To note, health officials did a pool test in the mandi and 24 people, including traders and vendors, tested corona positive in the past two days. This created fear among people who buy vegetables and fruits from vendors at their doorstep. “I take vegetables and fruits from the vendor in a bucket and use them only after washing them properly. This is the least I can do to protect my family from being exposed to infection because vegetables pass through many hands before reaching us,” said a home maker Mithilesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/24-cases-in-two-days-veggies-come-at-a-premium-as-meerut-mandi-closed-for-3-days/story-Bx7Uklzdnaiu8KhVADqk9M.html

It’s sad that efforts are being made to weaken the fight against Covid-19 for political gains. For the first time, a large relief fund titled Prime Minister’s Poor Welfare Package, involving a sum of Rs 1.7 lakh crore, has been announced for the poor, labourers and women. Those who used to siphon off welfare funds are upset because the money is reaching the bank accounts of the people now,” said Yogi while speaking to a news agency.Although he did not name any leader or party, his reference to the row over migrants rail fare was obvious. The Samajwadi Party and Congress have targeted the BJP government for charging fare to bring migrant labourers back to their homes. The Congress has already offered to foot the rail fare. The BSP has asked the government to make its stand clear and said it was ready to pay part of rail fare.Yogi said politics at this point of time was against established political norms and hoped the people would cooperate with the government. Listing out the relief measures, Yogi said: “In UP alone, a sum of Rs 2000 has reached the bank accounts of 2.34 crore farmers, with the first instalment of Rs 1,000 reaching the bank accounts in April 2020 and the second in May 2020. A sum of Rs 1,630 crore has been transferred twice in April and May 2020 in the bank accounts of 3.26 crore women Jandhan bank account holders.”Yogi said free LPG refill has been given to 1.47 crore families, while free food grains have been distributed to 18 crore poor people twice. He said sustenance allowance of Rs 1,000 has been given to 30 lakh labourers and vendors etc. The chief minister said wages of 88 lakh MNREGA workers have been paid on increased rates, while 14 lakh MNREGA workers have been given jobs.

06-05-2020||Chandigarh||Covid-19 patient in Chandigarh escapes to UP on bike||UT health authorities were left scrambling on Tuesday after a Covid-19 patient escaped on his bike and travelled 800km to reach his village in Uttar Pradesh.The 34-year-old man, who is a resident of Sector 56, was tested for the novel coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on Monday and his tests came out positive on Tuesday evening.A senior UT health official said that the patient was sent home and told to self isolate till the tests results were out. However, the man travelled to his native village, Purenewali, in Partapgarh district of Uttar Pradesh (UP), instead.The UT health department’s contact tracing report reveals that the health authorities learnt of the breech when they went to the patient’s house after his report came out positive.Officials later learnt that the patient had gone to UP on a bike with a relative, who is also a resident of Sector-52.“The patient’s report has been shared with Dr Abhishek, who is posted at the Community health center in Sangipur, and with the state- surveillance unit(SSU) in UP for follow up and necessary action. Station house officer (SHO) Amanjot Singh has been apprised of the situation,” the report says.NEGLIGENCE ALLEGEDAn official, on condition of anonymity, said, “It is surprising that the patient was permitted to go home and quarantine himself.”“The doctors at the Mohali civil hospital should not have allowed the patient to go home in the first place. They also failed to inform the health and quarantine authorities in Chandigarh,” said the senior health official.“The patient committed a criminal act by violating the lockdowns imposed in Chandigarh, Punjab , Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, jeopardising the lives of many people along the way,” the UT official said, adding that the patient in question had probably anticipated a positive test result.PROTOCOL FOLLOWED, SAYS CIVIL SURGEONMohali civil surgeon Dr Manjit Singh said, “It is our protocol that whenever we collect a sample, we ask the patient to quarantine themselves at home. In case the report comes positive the patients are shifted to Gian Sagar Hospital in Banur.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/covid-19-patient-in-chandigarh-escapes-to-up-on-bike/story-l7F7wTLYaDIpZfhyJKjkAI.html

06-05-2020||Delhi||Shutter up, metre chaloo: Delhi’s mixed reaction to Special Corona Fee on liquor sale||The Delhi government, on Monday, announced a tax of 70% on sale of liquor in the Capital. Dubbed the Special Corona Fee, this tax will be levied on the MRP (maximum retail price) of liquor bottles. The official order read: “The fee would apply at “70% of the maximum retail price of all categories of liquor sold through written licences for consumption off the premises.”This decision came in the wake of long queues and the unruly manner in which people thronged liquor shops across Delhi. A government authorised wine shop owner in Nehru Place, on condition of anonymity, gives a low-down on the implementation of the tax: “The tax will be imposed on the new stock. The existing stock is being sold at the same rate. Mere paas abhi tak tax lag ke nahi aaya, toh main tax pe doonga bhi nahi (I haven’t received stock at the new prices yet, so I am not selling it at the new price). Read: ‘Special corona fee’: Delhi govt to charge 70% tax on liquor from todayPeople were seen flouting social distancing norms, and at many places, police had to be deployed. Vishal Basra, a software engineer residing in Pashchim Vihar, says, “I did not feel safe going out because there were just too many people. All we can do now is meet up with friends less often because honestly, who would give ₹150 for a pint of beer? We will have to cut down the frequency of meeting and hanging out.”From a revenue point of view, this move will help the government recover and make money which can be used in handling the coronavirus crisis. While some have lauded the move, others have raised suspicions on its accountability. Rima Ghoshal, an executive producer living in Vasant Kunj, says, “We are still the privileged ones to be able to enjoy a recreational drink or two. But for those who have lost their jobs, paying this extra amount would make them think twice. This will also give boost to the black market as someone might decide to sell it at 50% extra, which is still less than 70%. The other point is, where is this money going? I want accountability for my tax money.”Citing a gap in the demand and supply of luxury items like alcohol, stand-up comedian Arpan Khosla, a resident of Dwarka, says, “It is a desperate decision to open liquor shops. It [the chaos] was bound to happen when you make something available after a long time. Secondly, I also feel that this tax should be used judiciously because the government needs money. But this should not continue for long.”This could also mean the last ‘cheers’ for some, at least for the time being. Prateek Ailawadi from Janakpuri, says, “I won’t be buying any new liquor as I don’t see a point in spending 70% more on the cost. It will curb the buying habits of many, as already, people aren’t earning much and there have been pay cuts across sectors. I don’t see any benefits are given to middle class families.”Interact with Etti Bali @TheBalinianFollow @htTweets for more||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/shutter-up-metre-chaloo-delhi-s-mixed-reaction-to-special-corona-fee-on-liquor-sale/story-y7zjK3aETbWopNhUImmHoK.html

06-05-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra Council poll to mark Uddhav Thackeray’s debut as legislator||The upcoming biennial election to Maharashtra Legislative Council will provide an opportunity to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray to mark his debut as a legislator, and it will also be interesting to see if there there will be a contest for nine seats which are up for grabs.Efforts are on to ensure nominees for the nine vacancies are elected unopposed, a Congress leader said.But, if the situation of a contest arises, all the 288 MLAs, who form the electoral college for the Council polls, will have to come to Mumbai to cast their vote.If the lockdown is extended beyond May 17, it could be difficult for MLAs to travel to Mumbai.“All the parties will have to take a decision on avoiding a contest and efforts are on in that direction,” a Congress leader said, adding that state party unit president Balasaheb Thorat met NCP chief Sharad Pawar on Tuesday.Later, leaders of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA- comprising Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress), including Chief Minister Thackeray, held a meeting to discuss the strategy for the Council polls.Thorat told PTI late Tuesday night that the MVA allies have decided to contest the polls together and field six candidates, two from each alliance party.The opposition BJP is also firm on contesting four seats, and it is upto the government to ensure nominees get elected unopposed, a source in the saffron party said.“If the MVA contests six seats, there will be an election. The BJP will field four candidates. There is no doubt about it,” the source said.Elections to the nine Council seats which fell vacant on April 24 were postponed in view of the coronavirus outbreak, but last week the Election Commission (EC) set May 21 as the poll date.This was after Governor B S Koshyari acted on a letter of the chief minister and urged the EC to hold the elections to allow Thackeray, who is at present not a member of either of the House of the Legislature, to fulfil the constitutional obligation of getting elected as a legislator.Thackeray took oath as chief minister on November 28 last year and per constitutional norms, he has to become member of the legislature within six months to continue in the post.The Shiv Sena has decided to field Thackeray and Council Deputy Chairperson Neelam Gorhe in the polls. The NCP is likely to retain Hemant Takle for another term, but has not declared its candidates so far.The Congress has also not announced its nominees, but senior party leader Naseem Khan, who lost the last year’s Assembly polls, is among the front-runners.Senior BJP leader Eknath Khadse said he has conveyed to his party that he is interested in being a member of the Legislative Council. “I am interested in state politics and I want to be a member of the Legislative Council,” he told PTI.Khadse said the BJP can win four seats as it has 105 members in the Assembly, and 11 members of smaller parties and Independents are also supporting the BJP.“These members have given in writing that they will be with the BJP on the floor of the House,” he said.The quota for a winning candidate is 29 votes.If the MVA contests six seats, it will need 174 votes while the BJP will need 116 votes.During the MVA government’s trust vote in the state Assembly last year, the ruling alliance had got 169 votes.The MLCs whose terms ended on April 24 are - Neelam Gorhe (Shiv Sena), Chandrakant Raghuvanshi and Haribhau Rathod (Congress), Kiran Pawaskar, Hemant Takle, Anand Thakur (NCP), Smita Wagh, Prithviraj Deshmukh and Arun Adsad (BJP). In the 288-member state Assembly, party-wise position is as follows: BJP-105, Shiv Sena-56, NCP-54, Congress-44, Bahujan Vikas Aghadi-three, Samajwadi Party, Prahar Janshakti Party and AIMIM-two each, Peasants and Workers Party, Swabhimani Paksh, Krantikari Shetkari Paksh, Rashtriya Samaj Paksh, Jansurajya Shakti Party, CPM, MNS-one each and Independents-13.The notification for the Council polls on issued on May 4. The last day of filing nominations is May 11. The scrutiny of papers will be done on May 12 and nominations can be withdrawn till May 14.The polls are scheduled for May 21 and results will be announced the same day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-council-poll-to-mark-uddhav-thackeray-s-debut-as-legislator/story-2j8UX2VrW1V29BHIxObqgK.html

But all has not been lost completely. Thanks to the virtual management, the hi-tech companies are keeping the doors of internship and job offers running.”Two IIT-P students have got internship offer in London and France-based organisations. Few others have got internships at Google office in Bengaluru and Hyderabad. However, several students were trying at Japan-based institutes but the process stopped midway.Shweta Kumari, a first-year student of Patna Women’s College, said, “My summer internship is scheduled in June. I have applied for work-from-home internship as it carries weightage in the yearly assessment. I am waiting for the confirmation letter from recruiter.”Meanwhile, the Development Management Institute (DMI) is also in talks with several companies for online internship.DMI dean Niraj Kumar said that the institute was planning to switch for a digital-mode internship.Kumar said the virtual internship is not same as practical experience of office training but considering the exceptional situation, it is judicious to utilise time.Two students of Central University of South Bihar (CUSB) have been selected by Indian National Science Academy (INSA) for summer research fellowship scheduled in June-July.Aashish Prakash and Awanish Pathak, both pursuing masters in science, have bagged internships at the CSIR-Central Mechanical Engineering Research Institute, West Bengal and Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Science,Uttarakhand respectively.CUSB’s public relation officer Muddasir Alam said, “Fate of their fellowship is tied with lockdown.

On Monday, chairman of BSEB Anand Kishor, said, “We are trying to find out possible ways for carrying out evaluation work. Since we have just 25 % of answersheets unchecked, less number of evaluators would be required for assessment.

Officials said that the board was just few steps behind completing the result process. Nearly 75 percent copy evaluation and marks feeding were done simultaneously till mid-March, said an official.

06-05-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: From Rajouri to the Millennium City, a woman who is living her dream||She can see the moon while lying on her bed. She often WhatsApps photos of it to friends, commenting good-naturedly, “See, what I’m viewing from my bed!”. This is a privilege that she acquired by the sheer force of her belief that “we have just one life and we have to take steps to make it happy, even if we are scared in the beginning.”Deepa Ojha is speaking this evening on WhatsApp from the isolation of her 11th floor apartment, in a gated residential complex in Gurugram’s Sector 66 — a wide vista of apartment towers entwined with green expanses of trimmed lawns. The lady lives in a four-bedroom house with mother, Sia, “who ran away from home to marry my father back in the 1960s”, and dog Snoopy, whom “I rescued from the Golf Course Extension Road in December, while driving home from office.”Drawing apart the curtains of her bedroom’s glass wall, overlooking the balcony, she gushes, “See, the Aravallis (mountain range).” A bluish outline of hills looming behind a series of towers is faintly discernible through the phone screen that connects Ms Ojha to this reporter.“It just doesn’t feel like living in a city... so much space and openness.”The private world Ms Ojha has fashioned for herself makes her particularly content because “I’m single at 51 and make my own decisions about life and its routines.” Which includes going to the gym, learning Zumba dance, and attending yoga classes. Though these days her fitness rhythm is reduced by the lockdown to walking “10,000 steps daily” within her apartment—including taking the dog twice a day in the apartment society’s “pet park”.This paradise is new for Ms Ojha. A senior executive in textile industry for more than three decades, she spent all her years in Rajouri Garden—her roots were so entrenched in the west Delhi neighbourhood that she even bought a flat there in 2003. That world was left for good in the winter of 2018 following her move to this rented apartment in Gurugram. “The shift was my gift to myself on turning 50.”Delhi is full of people who consider the Millennium City rather unkindly, viewing it as a soulless place crammed with malls and offices. If, however, they happened to listen to Ms Ojha gushing about the sustenance she draws from her new address, they might as well imagine she has settled down in the spiritual retreat of a pilgrim town like Haridwar or Rishikesh.The lady explains that she left Delhi after deciding to “give three hours to myself daily.”Make no mistake. She was materially contended even as a Rajouri Garden dweller and very happy being a workaholic, but “I had no time for myself.” She would leave home at 7.30am for her office and return at 10.30pm—that was her daily routine for 30 years.“I wanted to add quality to my life. I knew I could do it. I didn’t have to take anybody’s permission. Normally people have this desire to start their own household after they get married.... I’m single but I too have the desire to create the home I want.”Seeing through this decision wasn’t without obstacles though: her elderly mother, with whom she lived, who was unwilling to leave the familiarly of the Delhi neighbourhood., which is also home to her other daughter. In a heart-to-heart chat with her mother, Ms Ojha told her that “I will certainly not be living in Rajouri after you are gone... so why should I wait. This is the only life I have.”The lady ascribes this unusually frank talk to the upbringing her loving parents gave her — “with full freedom to follow my heart’s desires.”Eventually, the mother agreed to the move, noting, “Maybe I should experience the place you will live in after I’m gone.” The elderly woman doesn’t regret the move even if she misses the bird sounds of Rajouri Garden.As far as she’s concerned, Ms Ojha doesn’t miss her former home in Delhi at all. “I feel freer here. People are not intrusive or judgmental, and we all think alike.”By now the living room is flooded with the light of the setting sun. Ms Ojha returns to the balcony outside her bedroom, muttering, “It’s all about taking a stand... my life truly began after 50.” Not long after the phone chat, she WhatsApps a picture of the moon as seen from her bedroom. The scene looks like the stuff dreams are made of.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-from-rajouri-to-the-millennium-city-a-woman-who-is-living-her-dream/story-W3ywONmMWsj1LAOEPwnjFN.html

The BJP leader indicated that the state government was still making attempts to hide the real picture despite criticism from all quarters. Vijayvargiya’s letter to Banerjee came a day after the IMCT wrote to Chief Secretary Rijiva Sinha that the state had the highest mortality rate in the country at 12.8 per cent and the “extremely high mortality rate is a clear indication of low testing, weak surveillance and tracking”. The government is coming out with a much detailed bulletin since Monday, but the data it is providing to people still have a lot of discrepancies, Vijayvargiya said. “There are several unanswered questions on how the State Government is handling the Covid pandemic,” the BJP’s Bengal minder wrote to Banerjee. “But I hope, in the interim, you will take note of the above observations and ensure these discrepancies are addressed at the earliest.” “The government of West Bengal can’t give an impression of being callous when dealing with a sensitive issue involving lives of crores of people,” the BJP leader said.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage The Covid-19 bulletin of Monday has “some glaring discrepancies,” Vijayvargiya said, expressing hope that the administration would be more transparent in order to reassure the people that “they are committed to do whatever it takes to protect the citizens”. Claiming that there was no mention of the number of people who were “deprived” of Covid-19 tests and were “clandestinely buried/cremated as per Covid-19 protocols”, the BJP leader said figures of the total number of Covid deaths was still missing. “Instead, two separate columns mentioning patients who died due to Covid and patients who died due to comorbidities were given. ICMR/WHO-ICD guidelines require Covid to be mentioned as a reason for all patients, who were Covid positive and died,” the letter read. Eleven people died due to Covid-19 in West Bengal in the last 24 hours, taking to 61 the total number of people to have succumbed to the disease, the state government had said on Monday. Later, in an absolutely changed format of the health bulletin, it said there were 72 coronavirus deaths due to comorbidities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/in-letter-to-mamata-bjp-s-vijayvargiya-alleges-glaring-discrepancies-in-bengal-covid-19-bulletin/story-9SDOqpfMjEsKnzCkRURQgP.html

HT has seen screenshots of the posts made by the girl as well as other students who messaged the boy. The girl posted that she was attacked two years ago and “was tired of keeping it a secret”, before describing the alleged incident in the basement of her apartment complex and naming him.The suicide was witnessed by a close friend of the victim in another building, who said he went to check on the teen but did not report the suicide. Deepak Kumar, station house officer of sector 53 police station said the guards heard a thud and rushed to the spot. “They found the boy in a pool of blood and informed the family around 11.30 pm. He was rushed to the hospital where doctors declared him dead.” Officers said they will question students, including the girl who posted and those who commented on it.The police started a suicide inquiry under Section 174 of the Code of Criminal Procedure after parents refused to file a complaint.

06-05-2020||Delhi||Woman cop’s body found in car at Delhi’s Lodhi Road||A 32-year-old Delhi Police woman constable was found shot to death in a car that was parked in a lane surrounded by government-allotted residential quarters in south Delhi’s Lodhi Colony early on Tuesday.The police are working on the theory that her husband, a head constable in the police force who has been missing since the murder took place sometime between 2 am and 9 am on Tuesday, had killed her over a marital discord.The body was found on the front passenger seat of a Maruti Ritz car owned by a colleague of the head constable, the police said. The recovery of an empty bullet shell used in 9 mm pistols from the car has given the police a reason to believe that a police weapon was used to kill constable Renu Malik who was posted in outer-north district’s Covid cell.Her husband Manoj, who uses one name, is attached with the special cell of Delhi Police and posted at its Lodhi Colony office.It is the fifth murder reported in Delhi between Monday and Tuesday. Four of the murders were reported on Monday.Joint commissioner of police (southern range) Devesh Chandra Srivastava said a case of murder has been registered at the Lodhi Colony police station and the head constable is the prime suspect. “Multiple teams are conducting raids to nab him. The exact sequence of the incidents leading to the murder can be ascertained only when we question him. We have learnt that the couple was living separately for the last two-three years.”Deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Kumar Thakur said that around 9 am, a local resident spotted the woman’s body in a Ritz car and informed the police.Forensic experts inspected the crime scene. The investigating team later established that the car belonged to a head constable posted in the special cell. “He (the car owner) told us that at around 1.30 am, his colleague Manoj borrowed the car. Manoj turned out to be the dead constable’s husband, even as she used to claim herself unmarried,” an investigator said. The police raided Manoj’s home in Kotla Mubarakpur, but did not find him. Renu lived with her uncle in Burari. Her family members also suspected Manoj’s role in the murder, the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/woman-cop-s-body-found-in-car-at-delhi-s-lodhi-road/story-evsIC39YbCvC5k1T79eRwK.html

06-05-2020||Delhi||20 boys from 4 reputed Delhi-NCR schools part of lewd chat club||At least 20 boys studying in at least four prominent schools in Delhi-NCR were part of an Instagram group in which members discussed raping their classmates and made lurid remarks while sharing their photos, police officials said on Tuesday, as more details of what went on in the closed social media chatroom reignited concerns about sexual violence involving minors.Investigators said the group, “Bois Locker Room”, had 22 members in all, and two of them were adults studying in colleges, after they took into custody a 15-year-old boy who was identified as the administrator.“We have apprehended the 15-year-old boy and are questioning the adult members of the group,” said Anyesh Roy, the deputy commissioner of police of the Cyber Crime cell.“While we are questioning the adults, we are also interviewing some minors. We know the names of most of them, but are still ascertaining their other details,” said an investigator involved in the case, asking not to be named. On Tuesday, 10 members had been questioned over phone, while the 15-year-old was sent to a remand home meant for juvenile suspects. The content on the group included a remark by one member who suggested collecting a group of boys to gang rape a classmate, and several photos of schoolgirls that were accompanied with texts objectifying them. There were also copies of photos posted by girls on Instagram that were then appended with lewd and violent remarks. The conversations were exposed after one of the boys in the group took screenshots and passed it on to someone else, said the officer, before it was posted on social media by one of the girls who was targeted. “Some of the other teenagers we have interviewed claimed that they did not involve themselves in such conversations. One other student has said he saw these conversations as harmless. The student did not see the criminality in such conversations,” said the officer. The police said that they have seized some of their mobile phones to check if they were having similar discussions on other social media platforms as well. On Monday, multiple such screenshots were shared on social media before the police took suo motu cognisance and registered a case invoking sections of the Information Technology Act and the Indian Penal Code dealing with the distribution of pornographic content and making objectionable remarks about women. According to the investigator quoted above, the minor members will be booked under the juvenile justice act.On Monday, authorities of one of the schools – where the whistleblower student studied -- filed a complaint with the Delhi Police. “Once the screenshots emerged in the public domain, the group was deleted and another one created. Some girls were added in the new group to mislead police,” said the investigator. The original group was created in early April, the investigator quoted above said, adding that it was yet to be verified if all screenshots being shared on social media were actually part of the actual conversations or if some were morphed or picked up from elsewhere. Swati Maliwal, the Delhi Commission for Women chief, called out to other people who could possibly be members of such similar groups on other social media platforms, to exit such groups and report them to her. “Lockdown or not, such boys won’t be spared,” she said. On Monday, the DCW had issued notices to the Delhi Police and Instagram to respond to the allegations.On Tuesday, the Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) too took notice of news reports on the incident and issued a notice to the Delhi Police to take action in the case.“From a broader perspective, try to understand how such things come to pass. Our society faces three different sets of stark realities. One, we are a discriminatory society; second, we are a society where there is normalisation of violence, especially in close relationships; and third, sexuality and violence are intricately enmeshed. If one triangulates these three realities then one recognises that such instances are not one-off... A substantive response has to be thought of. To begin with, each one of us must communicate with our children about respect, equality and empathy: between genders, between castes, between ethnicities, between identities, between people. It is when we recognise people as people first that we stop violence and humiliation,” saaid Achal Bhagat, senior psychiatrist, Apollo Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/20-boys-from-4-reputed-delhi-ncr-schools-part-of-lewd-chat-club/story-C9oFvgNUFCzggvJKCNtLqM.html

They were brought to Amar Shaheed Sukhdev Interstate Bus Terminal in Ludhiana, where after medical screening, they were granted fitness certificates and taken to the railway station in the same buses.The train Ludhiana-Prayagraj Shramik Express (04606) comprised 22 coaches. It departed from Ludhiana at 10.15pm to reach its destination at 12.50pm on Wednesday.Deputy commissioner (DC) Pradeep Kumar Agrawal said so far, 5.4 lakh migrants had registered on the Punjab Helpline Portal from Ludhiana to return home. Most of them were from Uttar Pradesh, followed by Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal, he added.“Text messages were sent to 1,200 people willing to return to Uttar Pradesh, to reach the pick-up points. Of these 1,200, around 900 boarded the buses, while 300 decided to stay back,” the DC said.Commissioner of police Rakesh Agrawal said, “We have set up 50 pick-up points in the district, of which 28 are within the city limits. Staff deployed in the buses checked the identity of the passengers as per the list.”Train tickets were provided to the migrants in the buses while they were taken to the railway station in small batches. The TTEs deployed at the station checked the tickets and accommodated around 50 passengers in each coach having 70 seats.RAILWAYS APPROACHED FOR MORE TRAINSAgrawal said after approval from Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, they had placed requests with railways to run trains to Katni (Madhya Pradesh), Bareilly (Uttar Pradesh) and Daltonganj (Jharkhand) on Wednesday.He appealed to the migrants not to believe in rumours, and not to reach the railway station directly as they won’t be allowed entry. “Migrants will be informed by the Ludhiana administration via text message about the bus pick-up point near their residence,” he added.10 LAKH MIGRANTS REGISTER TO TRAVELRapidly increasing by the day, the number of migrants registering on the Punjab Helpline Portal to travel to their home states touched 10.8 lakh on Tuesday.Of these, 5.4 lakh have registered from Ludhiana, followed by 1.13 lakh from Jalandhar; 88,887 from Mohali, 59,053 from Amritsar and 34,242 from Patiala, besides other districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/second-shramik-special-train-leaves-from-ludhiana-for-prayagraj-with-900-migrants/story-KvJmVcPvEpFXblhuBiqwhJ.html

The tweet read, “Ghar vaapsi ke ishuk saare shramik bandhu kripya samaye se station pahuch jaaye (All stranded migrants willing to return home should reach at respective stations as per timings of trains)”. The information was also published in Jharkhand-based dailies. Besides, administrations of various districts also notified migrants over phone to reach the Ludhiana railway station.Consequently, chaos was the order of the day at the Ludhiana railway station as migrants turned up to leave for Jharkhand. Holding on to their luggage, the hopeful migrants showed the tweet and news clippings to the cops, who only turned them away.Waiting for a solution, they sat on the roadside near Jagraon Bridge, without food or water. They had arrived from Jeewan Nagar in Focal Point, Makkar Colony in Giaspura and Punjabi Bagh in Jawaddi.Many claimed they had also applied on the Punjab Helpline Portal on May 2 to travel to Jharkhand.“I got a call around 9am on Tuesday from the Palamu district administration to reach the Ludhiana railway station by 10.30am as the train will leave at 11am,” said Sarfat Ansari, 36, who hails from Palamu district in Jharkhand.A tailor at a hosiery unit, he had decided to return home after getting no salary from his employer or ration from the Ludhiana administration.Rajak Ansari, 35, from Makkar Colony wished to travel to Ranchi. “I have vacated my rented accommodation. Now, I don’t know what to do. I waited for two hours with my wife and children, but nobody from the district administration or police came to guide us,” he said.Meanwhile, Youth Akali Dal leader Gurdeep Singh Gosha reached the spot and distributed packaged water glasses and biscuits among those waiting.Eventually, deputy commissioner of police (DCP) Sukhpal Singh Brar reached the spot around 1pm and apprised the workers of the change from Jharkhand government’s end.He guided them that they will be informed through Ludhiana administration whenever the next train will be available, and their nearest police station will assist them.After he directed the police force to help the workers go back home in Ludhiana, three pick-up trucks were deployed.Meanwhile, deputy commissioner Pradeep Kumar Agrawal has clarified that the administration was sending text messages to migrant workers shortlisted to board the special trains. The text message will include the date and venue where these workers can board a bus near their residence, and from there, only the shortlisted workers will be transported to the railway station and provided train tickets.ANTI-RIOT POLICE DEPLOYED OUTSIDE STATIONTo manage law the and order, the commissioner of police has deployed 100 personnel of the Anti-Riot Police (ARP) outside the railway station, apart from the personnel from the Division Number 1 police station. The police are further coordinating with Government Railway Police to manage the rush of passengers and ensure their safety.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chaos-at-ludhiana-railway-station-as-migrants-from-jharkhand-look-for-train-that-wasn-t/story-iFa6W3YiW3pXoDfr7FLm1M.html

A video that has been circulated widely on social media shows a number of police personnel and volunteers dancing to Punjabi numbers with many not wearing face masks. Among those in attendance at the get-together were police commissioner Rakesh Agrawal, deputy commissioner Pradeep Agrawal, additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP, City-1) Gurpreet Singh Sikand and assistant commissioner of police (ACP, central) Waryam Singh.The officials claimed that they had a cup of tea with the police personnel and volunteers during the event, and they had no idea how the crowd increased after they left the police station.ADCP Gupreet Singh Sikand said, “All that was allowed was food and some chit chat, but what happened after the senior officials left, should not have happened.”ACP (central) Waryam Singh said some lower rank cops must have initiated dancing, ignoring the social distancing guidelines, but it should have been avoided. Police commissioner Rakesh Agrawal was not immediately available for comments despite repeated attempts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/coronavirus-lockdown-ignoring-social-distancing-cops-volunteers-throw-dance-party-in-ludhiana/story-scNNbmvK5vpWEwalKCkdCK.html

Front secretary Daljit Singh Samrala said when the media demanded accountability from the DEOs in this regard, they concealed the fact that the instructions were issued by them to the teachers, head teachers and cluster head teachers on the Zoom app. The front members said, “The DEOs simply answered that no such admission orders have been issued to the teachers.”District DTF president Hardev Singh Mullanpur said the DEO (elementary education) Rajinder Kaur and deputy DEO (elementary education) Kuldeep Singh had held regular meetings over Zoom app with teachers, head teachers and cluster head teachers (CHTs) of various blocks. “During the meetings, verbal orders were issued to the teachers, head teachers and cluster head teachers for admission in schools and written orders were issued by the block primary education officers (BPEOs),” Mullanpur said.“This is a violation of the guidelines issued by the government. Despite the written orders issued to the teachers by the BPEOs under the pressure of the DEOs, the alleged retraction of their own statements to save their own skin indicates the insensitive approach of the DEOs towards the health and education of students,” he said.The front members said they had earlier sent a memorandum to the chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh to intervene in the matter but in vain. “The verbal and written orders for the enrolment of students in schools during the lockdown should be immediately revoked. Action should be taken against the department officers,” the front members demanded in a written statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/admission-drive-ludhiana-democratic-teachers-front-condemn-education-officials-for-retracting-statements/story-dp6TdNierFIFjaTknbS0RJ.html

Also, there is a need to open the commercial establishments, including hardware shops, oil and lubricant suppliers and electric shops as the industry is opening after several weeks days and the machinery will require repairs.”FICO president Gurmeet Singh Kular said, “A large number of industrial units are situated in mixed land areas, including Janta Nagar, New Janta Nagar, Shimlapuri, New Shimlapuri, Dashmesh Nagar, Dhuri Line, Dholewal, Partap Nagar, Vishwakarma Colony, etc., which were established around six decades ago. The area of these units ranges from 50 square yards to 100 square yards and it is very easy to maintain social distancing in these units as few labourers work in these units. These units have also got Udyog Aadhar.”FICO general secretary Rajeev Jain and propaganda secretary Satnam Makkar also appealed to the government that the railways should not resume regular trains to Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and other native places of migrant labourers working in the city for at least 45 days after the lockdown.They rued that, viewing the current scenario, when the workers were keen to move back to their native places, it would be another lockdown for the industry if they returned to their home states after the lockdown was over.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/allow-industrial-operations-in-mixed-land-use-areas-as-well-fico/story-C9uya3ljP2jCNEDAXaDjgL.html

Maximum violations were witnessed in areas of Old City, including Sabun Bazar and Pindi Street, Jawahar Nagar Camp, Dr BL Kapoor Memorial Hospital and Giaspura. Though the district administration has asked the public not to use vehicles while visiting shops, several people ventured out on their two-wheelers during the curfew relaxation hours between 7am and 11am. With no police personnel deployed on the roads in Old City areas, locals made most of it, and were seen gossiping and laughing standing in smalls groups, most without any face masks.Avtar Singh, 57, of Karimpura, said he needed some medicines for which he came to Pindi Street. “It was not possible for me to walk three kilometres to reach the market, so I came on a two-wheeler,” he said.The market near BL Kapoor Hospital also witnessed vehicular rush. Lajjawanti of Chhawani Mohalla said, “Though grocery is available at small shops near my house, we have to come out to buy vegetables. Vendors avoid entering narrow streets and if they do, they overcharge.”YOUTHS PLAY CRICKET ON ROADS, QUEUES OUTSIDE GROCERY SHOPSIn Jawahar Nagar Camp area, streets were barricaded using bamboo sticks, but locals were found roaming around without any restrictions. Some youths were even playing cricket on the vacant roads. A resident said despite lockdown, street food such as “golgappas” were easily available in the area. The police never come inside the streets to check the violations, he said.Main market of Jawahar Nagar Camp was closed except some grocery shops. While the shopkeepers sold articles from half-open shutters, customers queued up outside the shops, waiting for their turn. Model Gram resident Prabhjot Singh, who was among those waiting, said, “There were long queues outside every shop. We are forced to buy locally produced articles as according to shopkeepers, they have run out of branded ones due to the lockdown.”Police commissioner Rakesh Agrawal said the police will initiate action against the defaulters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/coronavirus-lockdown-locals-don-t-give-two-hoots-to-social-distancing-in-old-city-areas-of-ludhiana/story-88NZ8mrBCOGxEHiKvAxERK.html

The municipal corporation (MC) officials are either diverting the supply from nearby tubewells or providing water tankers.Mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu conducted a meeting with the officials of operations and maintenance (O & M) department officials on Tuesday and directed them to expedite the repair and replacement work. “The councillors have been complaining about the defunct tubewells in their respective areas. I have asked the officials to commence the work at the earliest after getting approval from the district administration so that the residents don’t suffer during summer,” he said.Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) councillor (ward number 29) Prabhjot Kaur said, “Three tubewells in my area need replacement, including the ones at Prem Nagar, Indra Colony and Lohara area. Installation of one tubewell was stopped due to the curfew, while the installation of other two is yet to start.”“Though water tankers are being supplied in the area, residents are facing shortage of water,” she said.Scuffles have also been reported from Lohara area as residents jostle to get water from the tankers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/amid-lockdown-defunt-tubewells-add-to-ludhiana-residents-woes/story-4WXPGTuRpDeorcxZVlHuIO.html

As per MC officials, the trial commenced on April 29 and initial results are encouraging as the black water flowing out of the plant has now diluted and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) levels have improved. BOD is the amount of oxygen consumed by bacteria while decomposing organic matter under aerobic conditions, whereas COD is the amount of oxygen required for the chemical oxidation of total organic matter in water.Mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu visited the STP to assess the results of the trial on Tuesday and directed the officials of the MC and Punjab Pollution Control Board (PCBB) to conduct sampling of the water treated with poly aluminium chloride.“The results of the trial are encouraging, but we need to check effects of the chemical on the water coming out of the STP, as this water gets into the Sutlej and it should not affect the aquatic animals,” said the mayor.He added, “Both MC and PPCB have been directed to collect samples and a final decision on whether this chemical will be used to treat the wastewater or not, will be taken after sample reports are received.”MC superintending engineer (SE) Rajinder Singh said, “Till now, results of the samples are good and the black water, which earlier used to come out of the plant, has diluted. As directed by the mayor, samples are being collected.” An MC official, requesting anonymity, said, “Due to the lockdown, industrial waste is not getting into the STP and the trial might give different results when the dyeing units restart operations. The industry is accused of dumping untreated waste into the MC sewer lines, which affects the working of the STP and is a major reason behind Buddha Nullah pollution.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-mc-conducting-trials-to-treat-wastewater-at-jamalpur-stp-with-poly-aluminium-chloride/story-cMHI1myZxOhb7y0JjHrDsM.html

Most patients and their relatives are reluctant to visit the hospital as they fear getting afflicted with coronavirus,” said Dr Anirudh Kulkarni, assistant professor of neurology at CMCH.“Timely treatment can reduce the disability associated with stroke. Newer treatments like clot retrievals have been introduced, which involves the removal of clots that block the blood supply to the brain by using special stents,” Dr Kulkarni added.Dr Birinder Paul, neurologist at DMCH, said patients who were not coming to the hospital may suffer long-term damage.Dr Jeyaraj D Pandian, vice-president of World Stroke Organisation, said due to the coronavirus outbreak, some patients may be apprehensive about coming to the hospital. “However, hospitals have made necessary arrangements to screen and isolate patients afflicted with Covid-19,” Dr Pandian added.He said as per studies on prevalence of stroke in urban and rural areas published in 2015 and 2019, respectively, 140 people in a population of 1 lakh suffered from brain stroke in urban areas, while in rural settings, the number was 193.SYMPTOMS OF STROKEThe symptoms of stroke include sudden weakness and numbness felt on one side of the body, sudden difficulty in speaking and understanding, giddiness, unconsciousness and sudden headache.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-neurologists-caution-residents-against-ignoring-symptoms-of-stroke/story-ZTmQOhuiMNXGeBaTo8wqeK.html

06-05-2020||Mumbai||Migrants, wine shops: Every day is a new challenge for Mumbai Police||The Mumbai Police on Tuesday received several complaints on crowding at wine shops from residents from Ghatkopar, Mulund, Andheri, Powai and Byculla on their Twitter handle. Residents had posted pictures and videos on @MumbaiPolice of crowds at wine shops throughout the day. Responding to the repeated complaints for two days in a row, Pranaya Ashok, deputy commissioner of police (operations) and spokesperson for Mumbai Police, said, “New measures are being chalked out. No FIRs [first information reports] are registered, but we intensified our patrolling at wine shops.” The police also introduced a token system to disperse the crowds.Raghvendra Thakur, senior inspector of Versova police station, said, “The wine shop owners have been asked to distribute 30 tokens per hour. So only 30 customers will stand in queue while maintaining social distancing and others can stand far away from them to avoid crowding.” Police officers also said that it would have been better if the shops were not allowed to operate but with the government giving a nod for the shops to remain open, the police said they will ensure that social distancing is maintained.942 migrants set to return to Andhra Pradesh Since the lockdown began in March, 942 migrant workers from Andhra Pradesh have been stranded in Dongri, Wadi Bunder and other areas of south Mumbai. They were provided food by the Mumbai Police for a month with the help of a non-governmental organisation (NGO) and the civic body. These migrants are finally set to return home. “All of them will be taken to Kalyan in buses, from where they will board a train to Andhra,” Sangramsingh Nishandar, DCP, zone 1, said. Truck driver tries to ferry 40 to UP, bookedThe RAK Marg police booked a truck driver in Sewri on Monday night for allegedly trying to ferry around 40 daily wage labourers to Uttar Pradesh (UP) without permission. All the daily wages workers were rescued and sent back to their respective shelters in Mumbai. The police said the labourers were from garment and private electronic units in Sewri and Daru Khana. 23-year-old pelts stone at BEST bus A 23-year-old man was booked by Sakinaka police for allegedly pelting a stone at a Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) bus because he was allegedly denied an entry despite telling the bus driver that he had to visit a hospital for a medical check-up. The accused, Shahid Ahmad, who works with a private company, said, “The incident took place on Friday when I was on my way to Sion Hospital for my medical check-up. Due to the lockdown, I didn’t find any taxi or autorickshaw and hence I tried to board the bus. The driver asked me if I was a government servant. I explained that I have developed an infection and needed to visit the hospital. The conductor pushed me out and in a fit of rage, I pelted a stone at the bus,” Ahmad told HT.A patrolling police vehicle nabbed him from the spot. Kishor Sawant senior inspector of Sakinaka police said, “We have lodged an FIR against Ahmad because as per protocol, citizens have to carry medical documents and can travel by autorickshaws available for patients. But he attempted to board a BEST bus which is exclusively running for medical staff and other government servants.” 44 FIRs on Monday The police registered 44 FIRs on Monday for lockdown violations, of which 25 were from central region, while nine were from the west region. Seventy-one people were booked, while 29 were arrested. Both the areas are the worst-affected owing to the Covid-19 outbreak in the city.

06-05-2020||Mumbai||Only essential stores can stay open in Mumbai||Mumbai A day after the state government relaxed restrictions to allow non-essential shops, including liquor outlets, to open, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) overruled the order for the city, owing to the huge gathering of crowds outside wine shops, blatantly disregarding social distancing norms. Civic commissioner Praveen Pardeshi issued a circular on Tuesday stating only groceries and medical stores will be allowed to stay open. “There are multiple reports, news in social media and inputs received from the police and the ward officials that due to the relaxation there has been huge crowds gathering near these shops where it has been impossible to maintain social distancing and there were few instances of law and order situation arising out of such crowds gathering at one place,” the circular stated. “It has been observed that number of positive cases in the city of Mumbai have been rising and the downward trend to set in a gathering of crowds in large numbers without following social distancing will be detrimental to the control of spread of virus and the advantages of the lockdown will be lost due to gathering of people in large numbers,” the circular issued by Pardeshi further read. The state on Sunday had issued an order allowing non- essential shops, including liquor outlets, to be opened in all zones provided every lane had only five shops in red zones. But with Mumbai’s coronavirus cases reaching the 10,000-figure, Pardeshi in the circular pointed out the relaxations were likely to deteriorate the conditions further in the city and hence withdrew them.“Hence, I issue orders to the assistant municipal commissioner of wards that no such permissions for opening of the five shops which are non-essential be given and the police within each ward jurisdictions will ensure compliance of these orders . Only the groceries and medical shops will be allowed to be opened,” added the circular. Pardeshi’s order overrules state notification issued on Sunday, allowing functioning of non-essential shops (limited to five per lane) as well as the Mumbai collector’s order on Monday that allowed wholesale and retail liquor shops to be opened. Pardeshi being the civic commissioner, is an empowered officer nominated by the state to overrule orders of the state within the purview of the city. The corporation was earlier contemplating to draft a policy to the regulate functioning of non-essential shops by limiting certain kinds of shops and introducing odd-even opening slots for them. However, Pardeshi ruled out the policy in favour of a complete ban. Traders have criticised the move. Viren Shah, president of Federation of Retail Traders Welfare Association ( FRTWA), said, “Shopkeepers across Mumbai are shocked and confused with the government’s change in stand every other day.There was no issue with opening of non- essential product stores in Mumbai. Queues were noticed outside wine shops and not outside other non-essential stores. So why have other non-essential shops been asked to shut? ““As of now most of the products in the non-essential category have also become essential commodities. For instance, as most people are at home, they feel the need to buy garments, kitchenware, baby products, toys and indoor games, apart from groceries,” Shah further added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/only-essential-stores-can-stay-open-in-mumbai/story-RYFQObQtKgm8LqrkmR8OxL.html
06-05-2020||Chandigarh||PGIMER begins trials for plasma therapy to cure Covid-19 patients||After the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research received a nod for conducting trials for the convalescent plasma therapy on critical patients of Covid-19, the institute has started calling up recovered patients for donation of plasma.The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) had okayed the idea last Friday.The plasma therapy involves taking antibodies from the blood of a person who has recovered from Covid-19 and transfusing those antibodies into an active coronavirus patient to help kickstart the immune system to fight the infection.The Union health ministry last week had warned against the use of the therapy, saying it was at an experimental stage and had the potential to cause life-threatening complications.The hospital, however, will go ahead with the process. Since the exact role of this therapy in the treatment of positive patients is still debatable, the ICMR has decided to conduct a multicentric study to clarify its role on the patients.The collaborative departments for this trial are internal medicine, anaesthesia and intensive care, transfusion medicine, endocrinology, virology and community medicine.“We have contacted around seven recovered patients who have sought time to take the decision,” Dr Ratti Ram Sharma, head, department of transfusion medicine said.The study is aimed at assessing the safety and efficacy of convalescent plasma to limit complications in Covid-19 patients, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pgimer-begins-trials-for-plasma-therapy-to-cure-covid-19-patients/story-IyZfqSu2fyuxEP08sGHgpK.html

The directions were prompted after the petitioner said that there was no clarity in the tri-party state government on who would pay the amount. The petitioner also sought directions to the state to bear the cost of medical screening of migrant workers before they can embark on their journey back home. The single bench of justice S C Gupte, while hearing public interest litigations (PILs) filed by NGO Ghar Bachao, Ghar Banao through video conferencing, was informed by advocates Kranti L C and Ronita Bhattacharya that after the state wing of the Congress party had said that it would bear the transportation cost of migrant workers, the Centre had clarified that it would bear 85% while 15% would have to be borne by the state. However, as the Congress was a stakeholder in the state government, there was no clarity as to who would pay and hence the state should be asked to clarify. The advocates for the NGO also submitted that as migrant workers who want to go home need a medical certificate, the cost of the same should also be borne by the state government. However, after the state’s counsel submitted that the policy was silent on this aspect, Justice Gupte said that there was a need for coordination between the state and central governments on payment for the transportation and the same should be informed to the court on May 8.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-seeks-clarification-from-state-on-payment-of-travel-and-medical-report-costs-of-migrants/story-HkvayyQpuXNHKYg2g4EavJ.html

We request more people to come forward and pay their bills in advance,” said Grewal.PSPCL’s OFFERStaring at losses due to non-consumption of electricity by bulk consumers, including industries and big commercial establishments amid the lockdown imposed due to the novel coronavirus, PSPCL had made an offer to all its consumers in April.“PSPCL offers consumers of all its categories to make the advance payment towards their electricity bills up to March 2021, and earn 1% interest per month. Thus, consumers can earn around 12% interest per annum (double the rate of interest per fixed deposit),” the appeal read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/month-into-advance-payment-scheme-pspcl-collects-102-crore-in-ludhiana/story-Qaxeivej68h22vT48G3FLI.html

Residents had alleged that around 60% of the streetlights in various areas of the city, including Shimlapuri, Model Gram, Model Town Extension and Dugri, were non-functional, throwing all these areas in darkness all through the night amid the Covid-19 curfew.In fact, streetlights even outside the camp office of the mayor near the Rose Garden, residences of the municipal corporation (MC) commissioner and the CEO of the Ludhiana Smart City Limited (LSCL) near Rakh Bagh were also not working, the complainants said. President of the AC Market Shopkeepers Association and a resident of the Dugri Urban Estate, Gurcharan Singh Chan said, “Most of the streetlights in our block have been non-functional for around a month. Despite complaints submitted with the MC, no steps have been taken to repair the lights.”A resident of Model Town Extension, Simranpreet Singh said, “Even posh areas of the city are facing the same problem and the fear of thefts always haunts residents. In some areas, not a single light is functional in the entire street. Regular inspection should be carried out by the authorities and action should be taken against guilty officials or the company staff.” In response, the mayor said, “What can be expected of the company when even the lights installed outside houses of the mayor and the MC commissioner are not working. The completion certificate has been issued to the company for two zones, but still around 60% of the city is under darkness due to lack of proper maintenance. I will not allow any kind of payment to the company till all lights are repaired in the city.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-mayor-tells-tata-company-to-repair-dysfunctional-streetlights-in-two-days/story-A69WewdAtYGXbk6y0kYBUL.html
06-05-2020||Lucknow||UP govt clears confusion on resuming industrial activities||The Yogi Adityanath government on Tuesday came up with more clear guidelines related with reopening of industrial units across the state.To begin with, the District Industries Centres (DICs) across the state started issuing forms and a set of undertakings to be filled by local industrialists who want to restart their units.For districts such as Noida, Meerut and Agra, where cases of COVID-19 are high, the guidelines are more stringent.The form and the set of undertaking to all industrialists who want to resume production was sent through email.“We are submitting forms and in the next 24-hours permission is likely to be granted. I am hopeful that from Thursday onwards industries will start in the state capital,” said Awadesh Agarwal, president, Indian Industries Association (IIA), Lucknow chapter.

The district industries centre across the state have issued forms to industrialists who want to resume production. In the next two days, there will be some industrial activity in the state,” said Pankaj Kumar, national president, IIA.With the government exchequer drying up and expenditures increasing with each passing day in fight against COVID-19, the government wants industries to start functioning.However, even after clear guidelines from the Centre and the state government, district magistrates at the local level failed to set the industries in motion in their regions, say industry experts.JOINT MEETING OF ALL INDUSTRY DEPARTMENTSThe entire industry ministry of the state government conducted a joint meeting on Tuesday to make sure industrial activities begin at the earliest.The Industrial Development minister Satish Mahana and MSME and Khadi minister Siddharth Nath Singh conducted a joint meeting with all officials of the industry department.Infrastructure and Industrial Development Commissioner Alok Tandon, principal secretary (Industry) Alok Kumar and principal secretary, MSME, Navneet Sehgal along with other officials were present.In the meeting it was decided that the Infrastructure and Industrial Development Commissioner will conduct a meeting with the state home department and issue guidelines for industries.At the local level, district magistrates will implement these guidelines and will also make sure that there is no harassment of industrialists in the name of inspection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-govt-clears-confusion-on-resuming-industrial-activities/story-by56GnHzy3P963x8ezBbJI.html

06-05-2020||Mumbai||Maha tally goes past 15,000 as city inches towards 10,000 mark||Maharashtra on Tuesday crossed the 15,000 mark for coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases with 984 infections, taking the tally to 15,525. Just like on Monday, 841 of the new cases were reported in the 24 hours before the announcement, while the remaining 143 were over the past few days, as per the Central government’s directive to bring the data at par with the national figures on the website of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), the state government said. State capital Mumbai is nearing the 10,000-cases mark with a total of 9,945 cases, including the 635 new infections on Tuesday.Maharashtra breached the 10,000 mark on April 30, 53 days since the first case on March 9. The state took five days to cross the next 5,000. India’s worst-hit state has been witnessing a rapid rise in cases over the past few days. In the past ten days, since April 26, 7,897 cases and 299 deaths have been recorded across the state. Mumbai has seen 4,455 cases and 196 deaths in the period. The state also reported 34 Covid-19 deaths on Tuesday, taking the toll to 617. Mumbai saw 26 deaths on Tuesday. Of the other deaths, six were in Pune and one each in Aurangabad and Kolhapur. At least 14 of the patients who died on Tuesday were above 60 years of age, while 28 had high-risk comorbidities. The mortality rate in the state stood at 4.01%, down from 7.21% on April 12, but the number of deaths is increasing, with 299 deaths in the past ten days. The country’s mortality rate hovers around 3.23%.On Tuesday, the state directed district collectors and municipal commissioners to concentrate on containment zones as their monitoring is expected to become more difficult. “There are complaints of crowding in many places after liquor and other non-essential shops were allowed to operate. Restricting the spread from red and containment zones will become more important after the relaxations. The clampdown in containment zones, especially in MMR and PMR should not be relaxed at any cost,” district authorities have been directed. Late on Tuesday, the Mumbai civic body issued a notification, saying liquor shops and non-essential shops will not be allowed in the city, a move to prevent crowding.According to officials, although chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has directed district authorities to contain the virus by May-end, full containment by then is looking difficult. “He has set a target and asked authorities to ensure strictest monitoring under the principle of 3 Ts (tracing, testing and treatment) in containment areas. He has also asked them to focus on shrinking containment zones to neutralise the areas. Though the cases are not expected to come to nil so soon, we expect the downward trend to begin by then,” said an official.The official said that though there are various projections about the graph of the cases, the government expects the downward trend to begin in the next two-three weeks.Dr TP Lahane, director, Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER), said, “Almost all the contacts of the patients are traced and will be quarantined in the next ten days. During this period, the rate of the cases will move northward and once two weeks of quarantine is over, we expect a drastic fall by the end of this month.” Officials said the state government has set a target of May 31 to flatten the curve to ensure that the spread is contained and the lockdown in Mumbai, Pune and other cities is ended at the earliest. Meanwhile, the state government issued a clarification on timings of shops and establishments, saying that there would be no restrictions on timings unless directed by the municipal commissioner and district collectors. “All shops and markets, which are allowed to remain open as per the order, shall function according to their timings. However, municipal commissioners in MMR and PMR, Nagpur, Nashik and Aurangabad and district collectors in other areas will have rights to decide on the timings in case there is need of regulating these commercial activities. “There were too many authorities issuing orders without any uniformity on timing and days at the local level. This order brings clarity,” said Bhushan Gagarani, principal secretary, Maharashra government.The state government, in the wake of the partial relaxations for the shops and establishments given from Monday, had received complaints about too many restrictions. In some areas, police were regulating the shops without any reason and it was leading to crowding in the areas.State health minister Rajesh Tope said that the recovery rate in Maharashtra has improved. “As many as 354 patients were sent home after they fully recovered from the infection. This was the highest single-day number since the first patient was reported on March 9. We are conducting more than 7,000 tests in 45 laboratories daily and the number is highest in the country,” he said.In the past 24 hours, the state has carried out 6,561 coronavirus tests and 841 people have tested positive, which is 12.81% of the total people tested. The number of tests in the state touched 1,82,884 on Tuesday. 1,67,205 of them were negative. 1,99,182 people are currently under home quarantine, while 12,456 are under institutional quarantine. 11,629 teams of health workers have screened 50.81 lakh people for suspected infection, after they came in contact with patients. 2,819 patients have fully recovered from various hospitals, after testing positive in the past six weeks. Meanwhile, some district and municipal authorities have been imposing restrictions on the movement of people from Mumbai, the worst-hit city, to its jurisdiction. Ulhasnagar and Kalyan- Dombivli municipal corporations have issued orders to the citizens working in Mumbai to arrange for accommodations near their workplaces. According to the officials from the state government, collectors of many districts like Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg have refused to issue permissions for citizens from Mumbai to enter the districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maha-tally-goes-past-15-000-as-city-inches-towards-10-000-mark/story-ND3l18NX6phfj1ZlkqZweJ.html

Cause of action is ‘fact or combination of facts that gives a person the right to seek judicial redress or relief against another’, the court observed.The bench comprising justice Sunita Agarwal, justice Anjani Kumar Misra and justice YK Srivastava decided a reference made by single judge. The reference to the larger bench was made by the single judge in the case of Manish Kumar Misra and others expressing view that there was a conflict of opinion between the views expressed by full bench and other division benches in respect of the maintainability of writ petition against the orders/ decisions taken by an authority outside the state of Uttar Pradesh.“The only difference made by the Constitution (Fifteenth) Amendment is that the location of the seat of Government or authority or residence of a person to whom the writ is to be issued is not to be the sole criterion for conferring jurisdiction and writs may also issue to Governments, authorities or persons outside the territory of a High Court provided the cause of action, in whole or in part, arises within the limits of its territorial jurisdiction,” said the bench.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/petitioner-s-residence-alone-can-t-determine-court-s-jurisdiction-allahabad-hc/story-3E9rYGYZZISyb1cM0MjBNM.html

When the entire state is going through a tough time, the Badal family is expected to play a much bigger role,” Warring told HT.He said the SAD leadership is constantly using pandemic for petty political interests but the Badal clan that played an important role in Punjab politics for more than six decades and led government on five occasions should have come forward to work with the state government for community assistance.Sukhbir’s media advisor Jangveer Singh said SAD president was unavailable.The Congress MLA claimed that a section of employees hired by the transport companies, in which the Badal family has stake, are apprehensive of salary cuts and job loss due to the lockdown.“Prime Minister Narender Modi has appealed the business world to ensure that their employees do not suffer in these unprecedented times.

Senior officials say if all goes well the procurement will be over in 10 days from now, as compared to the last year when the operations continued till May 28.“Following the social distancing and other protocols was a huge challenge. We have overcome the tough phase,” said additional chief secretary Viswajeet Khanna, who heads the state-level committee on procurement and harvest.Amid the fast pace of wheat arrivals, the departments concerned are worried 40% of total procured produce (40 lakh tonne) is yet to be lifted from the mandis. The shortage of gunny bags may also hamper the last leg of procurement.As per reports, the state is facing a shortage of 12,000 bales of gunny bags and sending them to all 4,100 procurement centres will take some time.“We have asked the procurement agencies to purchase one-time use gunny bags so that operations are not affected. These will be purchased from flour mills, arhtiyas and rice shelling mills,” said principal secretary (food and civil supplies) KAP Sinha.Secretary (agriculture) Kahan Singh Pannu said barring some areas in the Majha belt wheat harvesting is almost complete. “We are hoping to touch total arrivals to the tune of 130 lakh tonne,” he said.145 FARM FIRE CASES SO FARAt least 145 cases of stubble burning have been detected in the current rabi season till date.On Tuesday, 25 cases were reported — Kapurthala (8), Ferozepur (4), Hoshiarpur (3), Fazilka and Ludhiana (2 each) and one each in Bathinda, Faridkot, Gurdaspur, Jalandhar, Sangrur and Moga.In 2019 and 2018, as many as 563 and 1,826 such cases were detected during the same period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-wheat-procurement-reaches-100-lakh-tonne-mark-in-20-days/story-8oftNx3coe63WSQgihJBJJ.html

06-05-2020||Mumbai||BMC mulls capping prices at private hospitals after claims of overcharging||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) held a meeting with the representatives of private hospitals recently to discuss capping the price of treating Covid-19. There have been multiple complaints from patients’ families regarding the exorbitant fees charged by private hospitals.On March 18, when the BMC permitted private hospitals to treat Covid-19 patients, all private hospitals were directed to charge ₹4,000 or 50% of the total bill for a bed. However, the instruction did not mention or specify cost of medicines, personal protective equipment (PPE), ventilators, staff services and other details.“We have learnt that hospitals are charging exorbitant amounts from patients. The amount has gone up to ₹1 lakh per day, which is not feasible. We have got the bills and found several loopholes. We called for a meeting with the CEOs to discuss the issue,” said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, BMC.On May 1, HT had reported that bills from private hospitals like Nanavati Super Speciality Hospital showed discrepancies and overcharging. Following the report, a reader sent a soft copy of his father’s hospital bill. His father, who succumbed to the infection, had been in Nanavati Super Specialty Hospital’s intensive care unit for 15 days. The family was charged ₹16 lakh.Patients have complained that private hospitals are also inflating charges for treatments not related to Covid-19. A 60-year-old dialysis patient, who is not Covid-positive, was asked to deposit ₹1 lakh in order to be admitted to Nanavati Hospital.When asked to comment on the allegations of overcharging, chief operating officer of Nanavati Hospital, Manpreet Sohal said, “Whenever any patient raises questions about billing, we always address their concerns.”At the meeting on Tuesday, the BMC discussed capping the price of treatments under the Epidemic Diseases Act. “We have sought their suggestions on the fixed charges they want to impose for the treatment. Once, we get it, we will impose the cap and if anyone is found in violation of it, action will be initiated,” said Kakani.Dr PM Bhujang, president of Association of Hospitals, said, “We are yet to come to a conclusion as we are still discussing it amongst our hospitals.”Cap on treatment costs for those without insuranceOn May 1, the state government capped treatment costs at private hospitals for patients without medical insurance. For others, capped prices will come into effect after they exhaust their insurance cover.In the circular, principal secretary Dr Pradeep Vyas stated hospitals should charge the lowest rates for procedures as per their pacts with insurance companies. Hospitals without such tie-ups must adhere to capped rates. The cost of an angiography has been capped at ₹12,000; angioplasty with one stent, at ₹1.20 lakh; dialysis at ₹2,500; and knee replacement at ₹1.60 lakh.Dr Abhijit More, co-convenor of Jan Aarogya Abhiyan, approved of the BMC’s decision and suggested that the BMC should check with experts for the service prices of medical procedures and set caps accordingly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-mulls-capping-prices-at-private-hospitals-after-claims-of-overcharging/story-tSVXPPNEhwkUAj3UqetrwI.html

One of these projects has been developed over around 21 acres.Speaking to HT, the minister said: “If found guilty, strict action will be taken against the officer concerned.”According to sources, Zirakpur MC officials did not even carry out physical verification of the projects for issuing fire-safety no-objection certificate or giving permissions for sewerage and water connections and setting up of sewage treatment plant. Even in May last year, the Punjab and Haryana high court had pulled up the Zirakpur EO over inaction in removing illegal structures within 100 metres of the Chandigarh International Airport. Warning the EO, the court had said, “Shall we direct the chief secretary to look into your conduct,” while warning him of criminal contempt proceedings.NK Sharma, the Akali state legislator from Dera Bassi, said: “Corruption in not just rampant in the Zirakpur MC, but all government departments. The state government is looking other way.”The Zirakpur MC was dissolved on March 8 as its five-year term got over, and now the state government has appointed Mohali additional deputy commissioner Aashika Jain as its administrator.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-local-bodies-minister-orders-probe-into-misuse-of-power-by-zirakpur-eo/story-m3KUlDOgb8sP5R8NU5lrRI.html

06-05-2020||City||Ghaziabad residents urge admin to allow helps and others to return to work||On a day when neighbouring Gautam Budh Nagar district administration allowed all self-employed professionals such as domestic helps, plumbers, electricians and laundry persons to resume work, the Ghaziabad residents’ associations have written to the district magistrate asking that such persons be given permission to function in the district as well.“We have requested the district magistrate to provide clarity on allowing domestic helps, drivers, electricians, and plumbers, among others, to return to work. Further, we want to know if high-rises can allow in relatives or guests and whether delivery persons can come to individual flats for doorstep delivery. Also, we want to know if residents are allowed to take walks in parks or take up cycling,” Alok Kumar, founder member, Federation of Association of Apartment Owners, said.“There is a lot of confusion as residents want these services back. They also need AC technicians/mechanics as summer has already started. There are senior citizens who need services of physiotherapists, private nurses, etc. So, we want the DM to clarify if any special passes will be given to these persons. A clarification from the administration can help clear a lot of confusion,” he said.The office bearers of Kaushambi’s apex residents’ body, Kaushambi Apartments Residents’ Welfare Association (Karwa), said domestic helps, drivers, plumbers etc are much needed in high-rises.“It is requested that a suitable procedure be chalked out so that high-rise residents can get services of such persons. There are many elderly residents who have been staying away without domestic helps, drivers or attendants. If the administration permits, passes can be issued to such persons and RWAs can submitted a list. Or, the RWA itself can issue authorisation letters. A way out needs to be drawn up,” VK Mittal, president, Karwa, said.District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said he has received requests from RWAs. “We will look into the issue and see how permissions can be given. We will chalk out a plan that allows for the movement of self-employed professionals,” he said.Manish Mishra, superintendent of police (city), said the movement of such persons was not restricted specifically by police.“There are many instances wherein RWAs themselves suspended the services of domestic helps and others in the wake of the coronavirus spread. There are complaints by senior citizens that RWAs are stopping their attendants or helps from entering the premises. The RWAs should approach the administration if their issues are to be resolved,” he said.Few standalone shops openMajor markets remained closed across Ghaziabad city on Tuesday, even as a few standalone shops opened after the district magistrate issued directions on Monday night.“There is a lot of fear among shopkeepers about the Covid-19 spread and many are still not getting any clarity about the order. On Tuesday, only a handful of customers arrived. I hope that with time, people will get to know that shops have opened and more customers start coming,” AK Khanna, who runs a small stationery shop in Kavi Nagar, said.“The shop owners need more clarity on opening and closing timings. The customers are fewer in numbers due to lockdown and there is less or no availability of stock with such shops. They depend on wholesale shops which are located in bigger markets that are still shut. So these factors have hampered many standalone shop owners from opening shops,” Ved Kumar, who owns a small bike parts’ shop in Raj Nagar, said.Most shops that opened Tuesday were those of stationery items, photocopy outlets, cobblers, electronic repairs, type puncture repair, and motorcycle workshops.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-residents-urge-admin-to-allow-helps-and-others-to-return-to-work/story-ZKgcTvOxLP7yjMNBIeGvNN.html

These are called ‘flu counters’.“Our audit will be completed by Wednesday as we have already checked 24 hospitals. Only Sharda hospital and GIMS are remaining and that will be done soon. This audit will be submitted to the state government. We have to ensure that hospitals have flu counters to ensure the safety of paramedical staff. It is important for the hospitals to provide all the required safety kits to their staff. Nurses and other staff members need to follow the safety guidelines strictly to ensure their own safety,” said Dr NK Sharma, president, IMA, Noida.Meanwhile, a 25-year-old Afghan national in Gautam Budh Nagar tested positive for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on Tuesday. He was among the 13 cases detected of the deadly disease, taking its case tally in the district to 192.According to a senior health official, the Afghan national lived with four other students in C-block of Alpha 1 area of Greater Noida. “He is a student of the Noida International University. He had approached the officials himself to get tested after which he and his flatmates were put under institutional quarantine,” the health official said.When the education Attache at the Embassy of Islamic Reepublic of Afghanistan in Delhi, Sediqullah Sahar, was approached for comment on the health status of their national, he said he was yet to gather all the information and would be able to comment not before Wednesday.Among the others whose results came back positive for Covid-19 are a 2-day baby and his father. They contracted the disease from the mother who is undergoing treatment for Covid-19 at GIMS, where she delivered the baby. Officials have taken the second sample of the baby, as per protocol. A 57-year-old police sub-inspector attached with a Noida PRV also tested positive for the highly infectious disease. His three teammates have been quarantined and the police are tracing all those he came in contact with while on duty in Sector 20. “The test report is positive and he has been admitted to a hospital.

06-05-2020||Noida||Admin asks industry owners to maintain health records of all employees turning up for work||The health department of Gautam Budh Nagar wants all industries which have started functioning from Monday to keep a tab on the health of their employees and maintain records for the safety of others. Workers who are on immunosuppressants are at higher risks of contracting the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).The Uttar Pradesh government had allowed private offices to resume work with 33% of the total staff strength. Also, industries in urban areas, export-oriented units, industrial estates and industrial townships have been allowed to function. The Gautam Budh Nagar district falls in the red zone category, and no vehicles, other than those related to essential services and carrying bona fide passes, will be allowed to enter or exit the district till the lockdown ends on May 17, 2020.Health officials have suggested that people above the age of 65 years, those with co-morbid conditions, pregnant women and children below the age of 10 years continue to remain at home.Doctors have said people who are on immunosuppressants are at the maximum risk of contracting the infection and such people shouldn’t go out to join work. Immunosuppressant drugs are a class of medicines that is used to suppress or reduce the strength of the body’s immune system, especially in those with auto immune conditions. The most significant side effect of immunosuppressant drugs is an increased risk of the infection.People on steroids are also prone to the infection. So all such employees should be allowed to work from home, doctors said. People with diabetes or blood pressure can join work but only if their disease is in control, they said.The additional chief medical officer of GB Nagar has said the industry owners have to follow the protocol of screening employees for body temperature before they enter the premises. “Owners of industries and offices should ensure that everybody is scanned. People should be made to sanitise their hands regularly. Social distancing is crucial and it should be followed strictly. One mistake can put many lives in danger,” Dr Sunil Dohre, ACMO, GB Nagar, said.“Organisations should maintain a health record of employees to ensure that anybody with flu-like symptoms can be identified. Persons with such symptoms should be isolated. It will require some effort on the part of the company but it is important for everybody’s safety,” Dr Dohre said.Industrial activities permitted since May 3 are manufacturing units producing essential goods, including drugs, pharmaceutical products and their raw materials. Production units requiring continuous process, supply chain, manufacture of IT hardware and mobile phones, units producing packaging materials, construction activities with employees on site and construction of renewable energy projects have also been allowed.Units having more than 50 employees will have to ensure timely pick-up and drop facility for employees within the relaxation hours (7am to 7pm).Private offices have been allowed to operate with maximum 33% staff strength, with the remaining staff being asked to work from home. “It is a crisis situation and everybody has to come together to control the spread of the coronavirus infection. We expect that all industries which are allowed to function will follow the guidelines related to the precautions,” Suhas LY, district magistrate, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/admin-asks-industry-owners-to-maintain-health-records-of-all-employees-turning-up-for-work/story-l6tQz77Z6WKUiGJf87Q2IN.html

The deceased helpers were identified as Rajan (50) and Bablu (27), and the truck driver as Sohanveer. Police said the three persons were ferrying wheat from Rajasthan to Ghaziabad when one of the front tyres of their truck burst.Prabhat Dixit, station house officer, Site 5 police station, said the three persons parked the truck and started replacing the tyre. “The truck was parked in the overtaking lane since it had broke down suddenly.

06-05-2020||Chandigarh||Anxious Haryana farmers awaiting wheat payment||Two days after Haryana took baby steps to start wheat procurement on April 20, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar had reiterated his vow to “purchase every single wheat grain”, promising to deposit money in the bank accounts of farmers “without any delay.”But in the past 16 days, the government has transferred “not more than 20% payment” of the over 50 lakh metric tonne (MT) wheat procured till Tuesday, top government sources, refusing to be identified, said.At the core of this inordinate delay are certain “technical problems” the banks have been facing while transferring money into the accounts of commission agents.“The agreements with the banks for transferring the MSP were finalised late. This led to delay in uploading commission agents’ details which were required for electronic transfer of the money,” a senior official said.“These technical problems will be resolved within two days. And funds are sufficient,” the official added.The government is procuring wheat at Rs 1,925 per quintal minimum support price (MSP).Until Tuesday, the government had procured over 50 lakh MT wheat from over 6 lakh farmers. On Tuesday alone, around 24,000 farmers brought about 27 lakh quintal wheat across 1,045 mandis in the state. Another key reason behind the delay, being cited by the government, is the changes made in the old and obscure system of payment that commission agents have been resisting. Now, commission agents will have to transfer the money into the bank accounts of farmers with details of loan given to the farmer(s). It is this transparency that the government wants to introduce, while the commission agents are resisting it.“All the payment will be made via e-kharid portal and in the beginning, the ahrityas did not support this initiative. Finally, last week they agreed...” a senior government official. WORRIED AHRTIYAS AND FARMERSSanjay Kumar, a commission agent from Bhiwani’s Siwani is anxious even after having procured 17,000 quintal wheat from farmers since April 20. “The government has not made any payment to us so far,” he claimed.According to Surender Kumar, a farmer of Yamunanagar district, he urgently needed Rs 50,000 to release payments regarding wheat harvesting. “When I approached my ahrtiya, he gave me only Rs 15000 even as I have sold wheat of around Rs 2.50 lakh to him. The government is yet to release the wheat MSP,” Kumar said.Not only farmers, but labourers and the ahrityas are a worried lot too. Ahrityas are unable to make payments of the farmers and the farmers don’t have money to pay wages of the labourers engaged for the harvesting.“I have sold wheat worth nearly Rs 50 lakh to government agencies but so far I have not got a single penny,” a commission agent of Kurukshetra alleged, pleading anonymity.PK Das, additional chief secretary (ACS, food, civil supplies and consumer affairs) said all issues have been sorted out.“We have already issued instructions to clear payments of the wheat procured till April 25,” Das said.“And in the next two days, we will also clear the payments of wheat procured till April 30.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/anxious-haryana-farmers-awaiting-wheat-payment/story-lvr1OJz4Lz2nl5J831SLHN.html

06-05-2020||Delhi||Covid-19 pandemic: Delhi govt begins cutting costs, shelves expensive projects||The Delhi government has initiated cost-cutting measures by freezing the dearness allowance (DA) and dearness relief (DR) of its employees and keeping any proposal for spending not related to the Covid-19 outbreak in abeyance till June 30.The move comes amid a substantial hit to revenues with a complete shutdown of industries and trade due to the nationwide lockdown to stave off the spread of Covid-19. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government has been able to generate only Rs 400 crore in tax revenues in April -- a tenth of its projected collections. In order to cover the massive deficit, the administration has been ordered to cut expenditure and take measures to put the economy on the road to recovery. On Monday, the city-state’s finance department issued an order to every state department, corporations and others, asking for all projects to be placed under “abeyance”. It stated that no proposal be submitted to the finance department for approval till June 30, unless it is an “activity/work” that cannot be postponed.The fresh order was issued after the government observed that departments were “sending files to the finance department for seeking relaxations and approvals” on different pretexts, even after it stated on April 8 that only Covid-19-related activities will be granted funds.In an interview with HT on Monday, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who is also Delhi’s finance minister, said that even if the lockdown is totally lifted, no government project will take off for at least two to three months. “Particularly construction projects, because they are capital-intensive. Paying salary is our priority. Only after that will we decide which flagship schemes to spend on depending on the funds’ situation,” he said.The state government’s decision to freeze DA and DR will affect around 220,000 employees and pensioners of Delhi government till July 2021. They will continue to receive DA and DR at the current rate of 17%.Sisodia presented a Rs 65,000 crore budget in March, the biggest by fiscal size for any government in Delhi. Besides other components, the government had estimated Rs 44,100 crore in tax revenues, excluding a GST compensation of Rs 7,800 crore. As per the Delhi Budget 2020-21 documents, of the estimated Rs 44,100 crore tax revenue, excise accounted for Rs 6,300 crore and Rs 30,000 crore was to come from GST and VAT. While the government expected to mop up Rs 5,300 crore in stamps and registration fee, another Rs 2,500 crore were expected to be earned in taxes on motor vehicles. With all trade and industry shut, liquor shops closed and almost zero new registration of property or vehicles, the government’s revenue estimates have taken a debilitating hit. Officials said besides cutting expenditure, the government may have to now review several projects and take a call as per the rate of the economic recovery. “The Delhi government is not even considering taking up any of its major projects, especially anything related to infrastructure. Construction works be it of schools or roads will take a pause. What we are thinking of starting with are soft projects such as notifying the electric vehicle policy or the tree transplantation policy,” said a senior official. Now, with the Centre coming up with fresh guidelines to relax rules under Lockdown 3.0, which will continue till May 17, the Delhi government has launched a graded response to jump start the economy. On Tuesday, the government levied additional cess on liquor and fuel. While an additional 70% corona cess was levied on sale of all liquor in the city on late Monday evening, the government announced 30% hike in value-added tax (VAT) on petrol and diesel. Officials said with the government struggling to pay salaries of its employees, these measures will bring in money to run the government machinery and pay for urgent measures required to fight coronavirus and start critical projects. As per the Budget document, excise makes for 14% of the total tax revenue. “But these will give only limited gains to the government. In the case of liquor sale, firstly only around 150 shops of over 800 have been shortlisted to open. Secondly, almost 90% of these 150 shops are not even being able to operate for the full permissible time of 9am to 6.30pm because of crowding. They are forced to shut for not following social distancing. So, the revenue is very negligible as of now,” said a senior official in the excise department.In another development on Tuesday, the Delhi government also opened sub-registrar offices for registration of property. “Registrations have opened in all sub-registrar office from today. Twenty-six applications were received today,” Sisodia announced in a tweet in Hindi on Tuesday. Stamps and registration fee make up for 12% of the estimated revenue for the current financial year. With the government rationalising funding, some projects that could be delayed by at least a month despite the lockdown relaxation include an underpass connecting Benito Juarez Road with San Martin Road, and the flyovers at Shastri Park and Seelampur, a second official said.“With the relaxation in in-situ construction activities, a few agencies like the public works department had sought funds for their ongoing infrastructure projects. Additional funds of this nature are not allowed at this time. They can continue with construction activities if they have funds in place, not just for the raw materials and machinery, but also for salaries. So, most construction activities are being put on hold till June at least,” the first official said.The government his hoping that the relaxations announced by the Centre to grant limited economic and normal activity while observing guidelines to curb the spread of coronavirus will help states to jump start economy and plot broader measures in the long run to chart recovery. “Our only hope is that more and more vehicles start plying on the city roads. The problem is now, even if the lockdown has been relaxed, people are going out only for essential works. So, the kilometres travelled per vehicle has also significantly come down and it is going to continue for some more time, which means the sale of fuel will also not be as high as it used to be before the lockdown was announced,” an official in the trade and taxes department said.The official added that compared to the monthly average VAT collection of around Rs 216 crore on petrol and diesel, the government last month could collect only Rs 37 crore. With the increase in fuel prices, it expects the monthly collection to increase by Rs 140 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delh-govt-freezes-da-puts-off-projects-till-june-30-as-revenue-takes-a-hit/story-jaFvuFJdJaVtKZKHJK1UmI.html
06-05-2020||Delhi||Tax hike fails to dampen liquor demand in Delhi||A 70% corona cess tax on alcohol announced by the Delhi government did not appear to have an impact on demand in the Capital on Tuesday. There were long queues outside liquor shops on the second day of the third phase of India’s Covid-19 lockdown, but the situation was not as chaotic as it was on Monday, when several outlets had to be shut because throngs of people violated social distancing norms required to contain spread of the deadly pathogen.Delhi has so far reported 5.104 Covid-19 cases, including 64 deaths and 1,468 recoveries.Of the 172 government liquor shops that opened after a 43-day hiatus on Monday, several in parts of south and south-east Delhi’s Govindpuri, Mandawli, Ashram and Kalkaji remained shut on Tuesday. Delhi Police officials said some had run out of stock, while others could not open because they did not have enough volunteers to ensure an orderly queue.Like on Monday, customers on Tuesday started lining up from early morning, hours before the shops opened. In some areas, the wait was in vain because the Delhi government and the Delhi Police did not give details about which shops would open and which wouldn’t.The buyers were a mix of citizens from all groups. People come in luxury sedans and SUVs, on motorcycles and cycle rickshaws.In parts of Tilak Nagar, Rajouri Garden, Karol Bagh and Jhandewalan, there were long queues outside liquor stores. Although some people said the hike in prices was steep, they added that their purchase was a “contribution” towards strengthening the country’s economy at a difficult time.“All we are asking for is better management. We do not mind paying extra money, but they should ensure we get stock,” said Mahavir Kumar, a resident of Uttam Nagar, who has to stand in line for 40 minutes before he could buy a crate of beer.The Delhi government on Monday imposed a “special corona fee” of 70% of the MRP on all categories of liquor. The fee would apply at “70% of the maximum retail price of all categories of liquor sold through written licences for consumption off the premises,” read the Delhi government order, approved by the L-G. In terms of income, alcohol accounts for around 14.1% of the city government’s total revenue projections for 2020-21. For 2020-21, the city-state projected a total revenue of around ₹6,279 crore through the sale of liquor, compared to the revised estimate of around ₹5,480 crore for the previous fiscal.Delhi has a total of 864 liquor shops. Of these, 389 are privately owned, and other than the 172 stand-alone identified by the administration, the other government shops with L-6 and L-8 licences are either in markets or complexes.The L-6 licence allows a shop to sell foreign liquor and beer, while the L-8 licence is needed to sell country liquor. The government’s tax component depends varies from one brand to another; but it is the same for all private and government shops.Compared to Monday, when the police needed to resort to lathi-charge in some areas to control the crowds, the intervention was minimal on Tuesday though force was used to disperse large gatherings in parts of Ghazipur.“The situation on the streets was peaceful. The local police got in touch with shop owners(liquor) and ensured that people ensured social distancing. Shopkeepers have been asked to rope in volunteers to help them in social distancing. At places where people were not following rules, they were advised and dispersed accordingly,” said Delhi Police spokesperson Mandeep Randhawa.Excise department officers said that things worked in better order also because shop owners were warned that they would have to shut if they could not ensure social distancing. “The call to shut a shop can be taken by police and the district administration, based on the ground situation. Things will improve further from here on,” said an official who asked not to be named.However, people did flout government guidelines in some areas. In outer Delhi’s Nihal Vihar, they started queuing outside a liquor vend from 5am; some spread bedsheets and mats on the ground, while those who had come in groups took turns to hold their position. At 9am, when the shops opened, there was rushing and crowding at the counters.Delhi police officials stationed outside the store said that the crowd was dispersed, and the shutters had to be downed until the store was reopened at around 1pm. “There is no management here. The police are treating us as if we’re goons. We are paying money to buy alcohol. They should tell people to maintain distance and come in line,” said Dharmendra Singh Meena, who had lined up outside the store at 6.30am.Some shop owners took it upon themselves to control crowding outside vends. In south-west Delhi’s Palam, they distributed tokens to ensure people did not jump the queues and start crowding. “There is a crowd but things are better managed today. We are regularly making announcements that if the norms of social distancing are not followed, we will close the shop for the day,” said Naman Arora, the owner of one of the stores in Palam.In Vasant Vihar, liquor shops in C-Block remained shut on Tuesday after residents complained of large crowds on Monday. Although people started gathering outside the shop on Tuesday, there was police on hand to manage the situation. “There was some crowding around 8am, but the police officials ensured the crowd was cleared and made announcements it would remain shut for the day. The market was sanitised on Tuesday,” said Gurpreet Bindra, president of Vasant Vihar residents’ welfare association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/70-tax-on-alcohol-fails-to-deter-delhi-crowds/story-n8Ty2mSzcb4ibjMclDHPKP.html
06-05-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh’s cross-border movement plans hit as Panchkula stays put with curbs||The UT administration’s plan to open up city’s borders and allow opening of shops and industrial units has hit a roadblock as the Panchkula administration is sticking to their restriction orders for cross-border movement.The UT on Monday allowed inter-city movement of people and vehicles, both public and private. While Mohali agreed to UT demand for issuing movement passes for private persons and official ID cards for government officials, Panchkula administration is allowing no entry from Chandigarh, exempting only emergency vehicles, ATM cash vans, LPG and oil containers, health officials and staff among other authorised government officials.Significantly, as per the Chamber of Chandigarh Industries, nearly 30% of management of industrial units in Chandigarh residing in Panchkula commutes across the borders daily. On May 1, Panchkula deputy commissioner (DC) Mukesh Kumar Ahuja had barred “movement for any additional purpose (not allowed under exemptions) without specific exemptions granted by this office.”Panchkula SDM Dheeraj Chahal said, “Movement passes are only permitted to those with medical or other emergencies. One-time pass can be issued in case of private employees of Chandigarh and Mohali, but they, as per the orders, have to get themselves accommodated there only. We are not allowing entry to Panchkula without restricted movement passes.”Meanwhile, Mohali DC Girish Dayalan on Tuesday said as the district borders Chandigarh and Panchkula, it is necessary to align relaxations with those given in these places to enable genuine movement of people. Those working in Chandigarh and Panchkula but residing in Mohali may apply at https://epasscovid19.pais, he said.UT adviser Manoj Kumar Parida said, “I am coordinating with the neighbouring cities to sort out the problem of entry/exit at inter-state borders.”All three administrations are undertaking thermal screening of outsiders coming to their cities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ut-s-cross-border-movement-plans-hit-as-p-kula-stays-put-with-curbs/story-RVNeGY94GS37LaeMPo0EPO.html
06-05-2020||Gurugram||Industry struggles with automatic permission on Saral portal||The new online system launched on Tuesday for industries to obtain automatic approval for the resumption of work during the lockdown remained slow and erratic in the city. The new system is part of the Saral Haryana portal, which has given a tough time to city-based industrialists for the last two weeks, who have found it to be slow and non-responsive. The automatic permission to industry and business were to be granted from Monday but the state industries department launched the new online system for automatic approval on Tuesday.Businesses in the city have been asking the state government to expedite the process of granting permission to industry to start operations, after relaxations were announced by ministry of home affairs on April 20.Industrialists based in Manesar said that they had been facing a lot of problems in uploading documents and information on the Saral portal for the past several days. “The new module must expedite permissions but for the past several days, the industry is facing problems due to lack of permissions and movement passes,” said Manmohan Gaind, vice-president, Manesar Industries Welfare Association, adding that he was very hopeful that the new system, which had become functional in the afternoon would improve things. Confusion also prevailed among industry owners on whether units with less than 10 workers need to apply for permission or not as per guidelines issued on April 30.Manoj Jain, Manesar based industry owner, said, “We applied for the resumption of operations with 10 workers but the system rejected my application. I spoke to an official and he told me I did not need any approval. However, the department of industries and commerce (DIC), Gurugram has made it mandatory for every industry to apply for approval.”A major difficulty faced by the industry owners was that they were not being able to upload documents on the portal and that the system was too slow. Deepak Maini, president of industrial development association, Sector 37, said, “Our members told us that a few applications were accepted but system did not generate approval at all. There were 10,000 applications pending for approval but there has been revision of the guidelines several times that has led to confusion,”In Udyog Vihar, the industry owners said that they wanted the government to do away with permissions for smaller units, which have up to 10 workers. “We are ready to submit the documents manually and also file the affidavit. But, there is an urgent need to accelerate this process.”The industrialists are also worried that so much delay, they will be left with no manpower, as many migrant workers have started returning home. “There could be a massive shortage of labour if the permissions are delayed further. A lot of workers have returned and many are ready to go back to their states. If the situation is not checked, we could face shortage of labour,” warned Manmohan Gaind.The authorities, however, said that they have streamlined the system and upgraded the portal, which will facilitate the permissions with ease.Digvijay Singh, joint director, DIC Gurugram, said, “One can apply online with the correct documents and f acts and can get approval automatically. We do not need to approve applications anymore. Now and as per new and latest guidelines, every industry has to apply. This system has been introduced on Tuesday. The system may be slow because of the rush of applications. But the technical team is looking into the matter.”The industries and commerce department Haryana on May 3 issued the latest guidelines that superseded all the previous guidelines.”These guidelines shall supersede and replace all the previous guidelines issued by the department so far,” stated the order by principal secretary, Haryana government.According to this guidelines, in a city like Gurugram which is in the orange zone, industries can be opened under automatic approval system with 75% workforce for the first week and 100% workforce on the second week(May 11-18).In Gurugram, there are 10,000 industries employing over 11 lakh workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/industry-struggles-with-automatic-permission-on-saral-portal/story-fas4NP5J8XJhbwwxijGxQM.html
06-05-2020||Gurugram||Restriction-free movement for Gurugram residents between 7am and 7pm||The Gurugram district administration on Tuesday said there are no restrictions on the movement of people within the district between 7am to 7pm. The administration added that barring residents living in containment zones in the city, who are not allowed to move outside, people in the rest of the areas do not need any permission or passes to move around the city between the 7am and 7pm.As Section 144 of the Indian Penal Code will still remain in force in the district, residents’ will, however, not be allowed to move from 7pm to 7am. Only those in an emergency situation will be allowed to move after 7pm after acquiring a digital pass from the administration. Interstate and interdistrict movement is still out of bounds.The clarification comes after confusion prevailed among residents about whether they need to collect passes from the administration to visit markets to or any other public place in the city as the phase-wise exit from the nationwide lockdown kicked in on Monday. The Haryana government on Sunday allowed shops, markets, businesses, industries and IT companies to operate with a limited number of employees.VS Kundu, additional chief secretary, Haryana, said as Gurugram district was in the ‘orange zone’, movement of residents is not restricted between 7am and 7pm according to the directions of the union ministry of home affairs. Kundu, who is also the monitoring authority for Covid-19 in the state, a so said that all preventive measures such as wearing masks, maintaining physical distance, and others norms prescribed for using private vehicles will have to be strictly followed by people.“Only persons who have an emergency situation would be allowed to move between 7pm to 7 am and they too need to seek passes online,” he said.Interstate and interdistrict movement of people would, however, remain restricted till further orders from the state and central government, he added.Meanwhile, in another development, the district administration has appointed Jivender Malik, tehsildar, Gurugram as the nodal officer for the return of migrant workers (especially those from Bihar) to their home towns. The district administration has also released three phone numbers—9560319839, 9899621163, 9899292234— for migrants to get in touch with Malik.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/restriction-free-movement-for-gurugram-residents-between-7am-and-7pm/story-dPPmYARHuXw68kZJZLWUZP.html
06-05-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt awaits MHA orders before releasing quarantined Jamaat attendees||The Delhi government has written to the Union ministry of home affairs (MHA) seeking directions for the release of around 3,000 people who were shifted to state government-run quarantine facilities in the last week of March from the Tablighi Jamaat’s headquarters in Nizamuddin Basti and other mosques in the city.According to senior Delhi government officials, while all of them tested negative and completed at least 28 days in quarantine, the lack of clear guidelines from the Centre have delayed their release. The officials said the Delhi government has received requests from several state governments asking that many of them be sent home.According to an official, 3,013 persons had been shifted from the Jamaat’s headquarters (Markaz building) and other mosques in the city to quarantine centres at Narela, Bakkarwala, Mandoli, Sultanpuri, Dwarka and Badarpur. Of them, 2,446 are Indian nationals, including 191 from Delhi.In a letter to the home ministry dated May 3, the Delhi government’s health department requested the MHA to issue directions/protocol immediately for the release of these people. “These people have tested negative for Covid-19, including several who have tested negative twice and completed more than 28 days in quarantine. We have informed the MHA that it is becoming difficult to explain the reasons for their extended stay to these people, especially during Ramzan,” said a senior Delhi government official, requesting anonymity.Home ministry officials refused to comment on the matter.This is the second letter sent to the MHA seeking directions, according to another senior Delhi government official.“While we are getting requests for their release from various states, we can’t release them as we don’t have a protocol or directions from the Centre. We are waiting for the MHA’s response,” a government official said.The Markaz building in Nizamuddin Basti emerged as India’s biggest Covid-19 hot spot towards the end of March, and accounts for at least one-fifth of the 5,106 cases reported in Delhi until May 5.Of the 3,013 persons in quarantine, 1,080 tested positive, as per the Delhi government’s April 17 medical bulletin - the last one that gave a separate count of Markaz attendees and their contacts. The Delhi government listed cases related to the Markaz as “under special operations”, starting April 11.HT earlier reported that around 16,500 people had visited the Jamaat’s headquarters around the time it emerged as a Covid-19 hot spot between March 13 and 24. “All the patients who were brought to the hospital from the Nizamuddin markaz have already been discharged after they tested negative twice consecutively. They have been sent to government facilities for a 14-day quarantine, which people who have recovered usually undergo at their homes. Many of them have also agreed to become plasma donors,” said a senior doctor from Lok Nayak hospital, on condition of anonymity. Anees Ahmed, 38, who was shifted to the Badarpur quarantine facility from Markaz on March 31, said, “We have been here for 35 days, and no one is able to tell us when we will be allowed to go home. Most of us here have tested negative for Covid-19 twice. We have completed more than the required quarantine period. Why are we not being sent home?”All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen (AIMIM) leader and Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi had also written to Union home minister Amit Shah to allow 38 people from Telangana who were part of the gathering at the markaz to return to their home state.“Wrote to @AmitShah @kishanreddybjp & Telangana Chief Secy Somesh Kumar sahab requesting discharge & travel pass for 38 persons from Telangana who are still in Delhi’s quarantine centres despite completing their quarantine period & all their tests being negative,” Owaisi had tweeted on May 2, along with the photographs of the letters he had written. “Our MP has written to the home minister, but we don’t know when we will be allowed to go back home,” said Ahmed, who runs business in Hyderabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-govt-awaits-mha-orders-before-releasing-quarantined-jamaat-attendees/story-LwEoHxjxzE4TfJ25irGfgJ.html
06-05-2020||Delhi||Covid-19 lockdown: Delhi issues SOPs for those entering city||After allowing migrant workers and others stranded across the city to travel, the Delhi government has allowed only people with no symptoms of Covid-19 to enter the state, according to standard operating procedures (SOP) released on Tuesday. Those with mild symptoms will have to stay in home quarantine for 14 days, after downloading the Aarogya Setu app, while those who have symptoms like high fever, cough, chest pain, difficulty breathing, will be tested for Covid-19.Officials working on the ground said that increased testing has led to the detection of more cases in the city.“It is possible that we are detecting more cases now that we are testing more. Earlier, only those who were symptomatic were being tested. However, now we know that around 80% people either have no symptoms or very mild symptoms. So we might have missed many cases who have now spread the infection in the community,” said another district official, on condition of anonymity.As per the SOPs for screening of the people entering Delhi, dedicated teams will have to be constituted by the chief district medical officers to be comprised of one doctor, one nurse, one nursing orderly, one pharmacist. The number of teams will depend on number of persons that have to be screened and the location of embarkment or disembarkment, the order states.A nodal officer will also be appointed to ensure that all the people moving in and out of Delhi are screened.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-issues-sops-for-those-entering-city/story-n2IUNiX2e7WE96G4Oq2p5J.html
06-05-2020||Pune||No consensus among Pune district authorities on allowing maids to resume work||Even as Delhi has allowed domestic maids to resume work in the non-containment zones of the capital, there was no consensus among the Pune district authorities on whether maids should be allowed to resume work. In a joint press conference held on Tuesday afternoon, Pune divisional commissioner Deepak Mhaisekar had allowed domestic maids in areas other than containment zones to function.However, Pune district collector Naval Kishore Ram countered the decision by saying it will be difficult to identify if the maid is from containment zone or not and hence, their services will not be allowed. Previously, Pune Municipal Commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad had said that domestic maids would be allowed to work with proper precautionary measures. Some corporators had also given approval for domestic maids to work. “PMC commissioner in (May 5) today’s standing committee meeting approved all domestic maids to resume work, but with guidelines for housing societies such as getting a medical certificate from a doctor stating no symptoms for Covid-19, having the names of all domestic helpers on society letter head with stamp and medical certificate to be submitted at Kondhwa police station for approval,” said Nanda Narayan Lonkar, corporator, PMC.However, many residential societies across the city are still apprehensive and are refusing entry to domestic helpers. “We have 90 per cent of houses in 25 societies across Sopanbaug and we are not allowing any maids, even if the PMC tells us to,” Sachin Khandelwal, a resident of Sopanbaug said.This situation repeated itself in many other areas too, where residents questioned the precautionary measures in place. “Our society is not allowing maids to enter, the PMC commissioner allowed them to work after necessary precautionary measures. What and how to ensure it is not clear, none of the maids are silent carriers and are not positive if they cough,” Surendra Birje, a resident of Pashan said.Due to the lack of proper written orders and no stated rules or medical protocol, the issue caused a lot of panic across residential societies. “Societies don’t want the risk of allowing external persons inside their campus. The contact circle created by several domestic staff working in various homes in various societies across local areas is a huge risk,” Ravindra Sinha, a resident said.Kalyani Phadnis, another resident, said that even if her society allows maids, she has informed her domestic help to not come to work until the first week of June. “I have small kids at home and I am concerned not just for their safety but for the well-being of the family and of my maid. I have paid her for the month of May and told her to take care,” Phadnis said. Sunita Salunkhe, a maid working in the Spicer road area calls her employers almost every week to find out when she can resume.“I live close to the society that I work in, and though the employers have paid my salary for a month, I cannot just sit and wait for the next salary to come. My job is to clean homes and cook food and I feel bad for not doing any work. Once this salary is through, I will need money and we don’t know when we’d be able to resume work,” Salunkhe said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/no-consensus-among-pune-district-authorities-on-allowing-maids-to-resume-work/story-DV3EE1UcQfkHf9UMm9xk9O.html

06-05-2020||Pune||Confusion prevails as top Pune officials huddle to clear status of administrative orders||Lockdown 3.0 has started and it has been five days since the Centre released its guidelines and two days since the new phase of relaxations were implemented, however, confusion and chaos prevailed in Pune as the top officials failed to be on the same page regarding administrative orders. Even during Tuesday’s joint press conference, there were independent orders by each authority on what will be functional - services of maids, supply of petrol and diesel, operation of non-essential shops and traffic movement.The joint press conference addressed by Pune divisional commissioner Deepak Mhaisekar; district collector Naval Kishore Ram; Pune municipal commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad and police commissioner K Venkatesham further added to the lack of clarity, forcing them to go into a huddle once again after the presser. “To avoid confusion, it has been decided that the PMC chief will take decisions regarding containment and non-containment zones in the city while the district collector has been authorised to decide orders for the rest of the district,” said Mhaisekar. PMC chief Shekhar Gaikwad said he will issue fresh order about non-essential shops and its timings by Wednesday morning. Earlier in the press conference, Mhaisekar had said, “Maids in areas other than containment zones will be allowed to function.” However, collector Ram countered it by saying it will be difficult to identify if the maid is from containment zone or not and hence, their services will not be allowed.On the issue of functioning of five non-essential shops in every lane, PMC commissioner Gaikwad’s order was to allow them. However, district collector Ram said that in absence of any clarity on which shops should be allowed to function, no decision will be taken till May 17. Mhaisekar, according to officials, has asked PMC chief to work on the odd-even formula under which five non-essential commodity shops will be allowed to operate on alternate days on every street.The lack of clarity was evident during the discussion on supply of petrol and diesel as well as the petrol pump dealers association of Pune said that all dealers have been allowed to give fuel to everyone. However, collector Ram said, “Only those involved in essential services will get fuel.”On the issue of traffic movement, Mhaisekar said that a decision will be taken soon on who will be allowed to go out. As per the previous order, only those involved in essential services will be allowed to step out with passes offered by police authorities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/confusion-prevails-as-top-pune-officials-huddle-to-clear-status-of-administrative-orders/story-DmbXU710a5FkPb4tJyIKzJ.html

While trains have started from various parts of Maharashtra, authorities are yet to give details about Pune.Divisional commissioner Deepak Mhaisekar said, “We have sent details of migrant workers to respective states and once they reply, we will send the workers. The migrants can get preliminary medical check-up done from any private medical practitioner and procure certificate. The process is a bit lengthy and therefore taking time”The three-step registration requires the labourers to collect forms and enter details. including name, Aadhaar number, phone number and destination. However, the forms will not be processed without a medical certificate stating absence of flu-like symptoms is the second step. In the third step, the information will be sent to respective districts in states.In Pune city and Pimpri-Chinchwad, the onus of registration was put on the local police while the local governments were asked to head the process in rural areas of the district by district collector Naval Kishore Ram.The Pune city police stations, which have a high number of labourer population in their jurisdiction, have tied up with doctors’ associations in their areas.The Pune Doctor’s Association, an organisation of doctors from Katraj and Bharati Vidyapeeth area, have joined hands with the police to provide certificates to over 13,000 labourers.“We have asked the doctors to charge a nominal fee of Rs 50. We have also urged them to not charge from those who cannot pay. There are more than 100 doctors working towards this now,” said senior inspector Vasant Kunwar of Bharati Vidyapeeth police station.“The police provided us with the copies of empty certificates and around 150 doctors in the area are now issuing certificates. This includes most of the local OPDs,” said Dr Anil Lingade, president of Pune Doctors’ Association (PDA).“Our OPD is functioning all working hours of the day (10am-2pm and 6pm-9pm) to issue certificates. We have also set up 3 camps in our area where labour camps are located. The camps are monitored by PMC health department staff.

06-05-2020||Pune||Social stigma a hurdle: Only 2 donors in Pune volunteer to give blood for plasma therapy||Fear of ostracisation, stemming from the social stigma attached to the virus, is preventing residents who have recovered from the Sars-Cov-2 virus, which causes the Covid-19 infection, from volunteering to donate blood for plasma therapy.A senior doctor at Sassoon General hospital, requesting anonymity, said, “We have contacted 40 people till date and only two have come forward.”All 40 are patients who have tested negative for Covid-19, after having being treated and healed of the infection.“The blood collected needs to be tested for anti-bodies and other illnesses before plasma can be separated. However, most have refused because of apprehensions about donating blood for this reason. Some say that their family is prohibiting them from donating the blood; some are fasting for Ramzan and so can donate blood only after the fasting season ends. We are trying to counsel them as much as possible.” Of the 40 approached by Sassoon, only two have agreed, the doctor confirmed.On April 24, State health minister Rajesh Tope stated that the central health ministry has allowed the use of plasma therapy as clinical trial on critically ill patients at state government hospitals, including Sassoon hospital in Pune.According to Sassoon authorities, the hospital is yet to receive final approval for insurance of the recipient, a technical formality still pending with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).Dr Subhash Salunkhe, chairman, Communicable Diseases Prevention and Control Technical Committee, said, “We will soon get the final approval from ICMR. In addition, we are also facing resistance form those who are completely cured of the virus. For plasma therapy, we need the plasma from the blood of those who have been completely cured of the virus.“However, most people who have been contacted are refusing to come forward to donate their blood. Once all approvals are in place we will try harder to counsel and convince donors to come forward. Although plasma therapy is not a single line of treatment, it has shown some positive results in foreign countries when used in collaboration with other treatment lines.”As per ICMR guidelines, only those patients who have been completely cured of the infection and tested negative twice after a gap of 24 hours post the incubation period of 14 days can donate blood for plasma therapy. The person must weigh at least 55kg; must not be pregnant; must be above the age of 18; and must not be HIV+, or Hepatitus B+. The person must not show any signs of Covid-19 infection or any flu-like symptoms for at least 28 days post recovery. In Pune district, as of May 4, 553 people have been discharged after being declared completely cured out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/social-stigma-a-hurdle-only-2-donors-volunteer-to-give-blood-for-plasma-therapy/story-xnKyfNUFRwT1sZi4Gf8AeP.html
06-05-2020||Pune||With 77 cases in a month, cantonment areas emerge as Pune’s fresh hotspots||The Pune, Khadki and Dehu road Cantonment areas, combined, have reported 77 Covid-19 positive cases and three deaths in the last 30 days.The worst-affected of the three is the Pune Cantonment board (PCB), which has reported 54 positive cases of the 77 in all the Cantonment areas. The Khadki Cantonment board has reported 21 cases, whereas the Dehu road Cantonment board has reported 2 cases. The Cantonment boards fall under the ministry of defence and are located in some of the most congested parts of the city.The PCB borders Bhavani peth, that has the highest number of Covid-19 cases in the city.Amit Kumar, chief executive officer (CEO) of Pune Cantonment board (PCB) said, most of the cases which have been reported in PCB are from New Modikhana and areas adjacent to Bhavani peth, which is a red zone.“Initially, there were people entering from Bhavani peth which might have caused the infection to spread. We have now sealed the area to stop any movement of people from Bhavani peth inside PCB,” Kumar said.According to Kumar, the PCB administration swung into action after the first case was identified on April 7, of senior citizen who tested Covid-19 positive.Each Cantonment area has one hospital, however these hospitals do not have ventilators or ICU facilities, which is why patients are required to be shifted to other hospitals, including the Yashwantrao Chavan Memorial and the Aundh district hospital.The PCB aims to begin a 10-bed ICU facility in its 100-bedded Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Cantonment General Hospital.“We have already issued a tender and in the next 10 days our ICU facility should be ready. We do not have any shortage of experts or infrastructure; we will ensure that the spread of the virus is contained. We have not referred a single patient as of yet to our hospital but we need to be prepared for any eventuality,” Kumar said.Despite various schemes for the treatment of defence personnel, some private and government hospitals are refusing admission due to overflow of Covid-19 wards.According to Dr Ranjeet Bhosale, resident medical officer at Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Cantonment General Hospital, without ventilators or ICU facilities the patients had to be referred to private hospitals and even government hospitals including Sassoon.“However, our patients who needed intensive care were refused admission at private hospitals and Sassoon citing overflowing Covid-19 wards in hospitals,” Bhosale said.Bhosale further added that most of the cases reported were from a single source, the person’s family, neighbours and others were infected following a false negative after which the patient was discharged from a government hospital.“We also faced a lot of resistance from people especially in slum areas post the tablighi report. People hid their travel history and any flu like symptoms,” Bhosale said.The Cantonment board had to take police help to ensure that the lockdown is strictly implemented in slums especially where congestion is a huge issue with multiple people living in the same house.“Areas like Sayyedwada, Kasai Mohalla and Darga vasahat are densely populated,” Bhosale said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/with-77-cases-in-a-month-cantonment-areas-emerge-as-city-s-fresh-hotspots/story-MqgJWxvGIpiH9HFsF8c8gP.html
06-05-2020||Kolkata||Blind people fear days after lockdown, say social distancing is a curse||Rahul Gambhir, a 31-year-old banker from Mumbai, is worried about the day when the Covid-19 lockdown will be lifted and he will have to join office again. His office is at Nariman Point, which is at least 20km away from his flat at Chembur. There are several questions worrying Gambhir, who is totally blind since birth.Like before, will a passerby be ready to hold his hand and assist him to board the train from Chembur railway station? Will he able to hold the hand of that stranger without hesitation? How will he be able to cross the busy Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CST) station without any assistance?“These questions are passing through my mind now. I am sure people like me are also thinking in the same lines. Because such a problem is bound to arise, the moment we step outside of the house again after the lockdown to resume work,” said Gambhir.“Manoeuvring through the CST station during peak office hour will become next to impossible without assistance,” he said.His wife Geetanjali , who works in a government school in Delhi and lives in the Palam area of the national capital with their three-year-old daughter, is also totally blind since birth. She will also face the same problem and so will millions of other blind people in India.For people like Rahul and Anjali, they primarily depend on touch to know what’s in front of them. For this section of citizens, social distancing and physical distancing has come as a curse. These people depend a lot on others when they are out of the streets. “As long as we are within the four walls of our houses or inside the office, we don’t need any assistance. It is because the ambience is known to us. But when we are out of the roads and travelling we need some kind of assistance – to board buses and trains, to cross the road,” 55-year-old Indranath Banerjee, said. The history teacher at Ramakrishna Mission Blind Boys Academy at Narendrapur in the southern fringes of Kolkata has to first take the Metro and then an auto-rickshaw to reach the academy, at least 30km away from his home.According to figures provided by the Union health and family welfare ministry in the Lok Sabha on November 29, 2019, at least 0.36% of the Indian population is blind. This puts the number of blind persons in India to not less than 3.7 million. “I have heard that nearly 80% are patients are asymptomatic. While on one hand, I may not get any assistance, on the other hand, what could be worse is that without any assistance I may bump into a person who might be a carrier,” said Vaishali, a blind student studying BA at the Government First Grade College in Bengaluru.“We need to touch each and everything to get an idea of our ambience. That’s even more worrisome,” she said.Students like Vaishali have yet another reason to worry about—exams. Usually, they take the help of scribes who sit closely. The scribes read out the question, the blind person dictates the answer and the scribe pens it down on the answer sheet.“Once the schools and colleges reopen, we will need such help as exams will be held. I wonder who will volunteer because scribes need to sit very close to the blind person in the exam hall,” she added.Keeping in mind all these difficulties, which may arise once the lockdown is lifted, NGOs working for blind persons in India are now coming up with guidelines in the form of do’s and don’ts for their members to avoid contracting the disease.“Apart from the basics such as wearing masks and gloves, we would tell them to carry a small hand sanitiser every time they go out. They should not hold the strangers’ arms, hands or palm, instead they should just touch his shoulder while crossing the road,” Prashant Ranjan Verma, the general secretary of National Association for the Blind in Delhi, said.Verma said they are also planning to approach examination boards which conduct examinations such as ICSE and CBSE to find out if there could be an alternative way where blind students don’t need scribes. “Maybe they can get recorded questions (audio) and can record their answers and send them to examiners,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/blind-people-fear-days-after-lockdown-say-social-distancing-is-a-curse/story-ogyKpsOJPcpoDFKhTUkmHO.html
06-05-2020||Pune||Labourers seeking safe passage throng police stations even as construction allowed in Pune||The police have received at least 15,500 applications for registration of migrant labourers who wish to go back home. The applications are coming in based on central government directions even though the local police have allowed for construction work to begin, provided the labourers are provided accommodation on site.“I do not wish for an exodus to take place. I urge the labourers to stay back as construction sites with in-situ labourers are allowed. The work is going to begin and they should wait for it,” said Ravindra Shisve, joint commissioner of Pune police.The latest Pune police order, in keeping with state government’s advice, has granted permission for construction work to begin wherever in-situ workers are available. However, the central government had ordered all states to coordinate with each other to facilitate return of labourers to their respective home states. The two conflicting orders have created a tough situation for the construction sites in the city. In the city, the highest number of applications came from natives of Uttar Pradesh followed by Bihar, West Bengal, Jharkhand, Karnataka and Chhattisgarh. Applications were made by natives of 17 states on Sunday and Monday after announcements were made various modes including public announcement systems and loud speakers.The applicants are given a four-page form to fill and their contact numbers, along with Aadhaar number, current address and destination address is noted down. The forms are being accepted, however, they will be processed only after a practicing medical professional provides health certificate to the applicant.In the first two days, maximum number of labourers registered at Bharati Vidyapeeth police station.“We have over 7,000 applications on day 1 alone. Most of the workers here are from Uttar Pradesh. There is a sense of trust among the labourers towards the police. Therefore, such a huge number of applications could be recorded without any hassles. The process of medical check-up, however, will need some time,” said Sarjerao Babar, assistant commissioner of police, Swargate division, Pune police.One other police station which received a large number of applications was Chandannagar. “We have received applications from about 3,000 people. There are around 7,000-8,000 labourers in our jurisdiction. Therefore, more are expected,” said senior police inspector Shankar Khatke of Chandannagar police station.The officials of Warje Malwadi, which has received around 1,200 applications so far, witnessed a display of restlessness from the labourers.“We had put up a board at the labour pick-up point (majur adda) for the website link that can help the labourers with online applications. A check post is located nearby. They all gathered there to see the board while some started asking for their forms to be filled by the police who were deployed at the check-post. That led to a disagreement and the atmosphere turned tense so they had to be dispersed. No lathi charge was done,” said senior police inspector Ashok Kadam of Warje Malwadi police station. The permission of starting work with in-situ workers, however, has provided hope for the builders. The builders will be expected to take care of accommodation, food, and sanitation needs for the labourers.“No site has started today (Monday), but everybody has started mobilising. First, we need to organise workers. Before that we need supervisory staff to visit sites. Staff is living in different areas - Pune rural, Pimpri-Chinchwad and Pune city jurisdiction. We also need permission to bring some raw material. We also suggested that the supervisory staff be given identity cards which will help them move around. We are hopeful that the process will begin soon,” said Suhas Merchant, president of Credai, Pune.“For companies (which have factories outside PMC) and construction work (in-situ) - movement of staff (from non-containment area) is allowed in ‘dedicated vehicle- bus’ rather than individual vehicles; facilitated through punepolice.in,” said K Venkatesham, commissioner of Pune police in a tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/labourers-seeking-safe-passage-throng-police-stations-even-as-construction-allowed-in-pune/story-Ig6Yq5y3b5XZ0jB8NBlwNM.html

06-05-2020||World||Mutant coronavirus more contagious, says study||US researchers said Tuesday the coronavirus that started the epidemic in Wuhan has mutated, and it is more contagious now. This new strain, which is sweeping through the United States, can have implications for the hunt for a vaccine.It spread first in Europe and then to the United States and Canada and has been dominant strain globally since March, researchers at Los Alamos National Laboratory in a 33-page paper in BioRxiv, a scientific journal that publishes pre-peer reviewed papers.If it does not subside in summer, it could further mutate and could potentially be less effective to vaccines that are being developed, the researchers said.Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverage“This is hard news,” Bette Korber, a computational biologist at Los Alamos and lead author of the study wrote on her Facebook page, as reported by the Los Angeles Times.“But please don’t only be disheartened by it,” she went on. “Our team at LANL was able to document this mutation and its impact on transmission only because of a massive global effort of clinical people and experimental groups, who make new sequences of the virus (SARS-CoV-2) in their local communities available as quickly as they possibly can.”Upwards of 90 separate efforts are underway in the United States to find a vaccine as the epidemic continues to rage across the country.It has killed 71,152 people in the United States so far, up by 1,240 in the last 24 hours and infected 1.2 million with 22,335 infections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mutant-coronavirus-more-contagious-says-study/story-yfT41XVnyAmDGiTmscUqvN.html

Those statements can both be true,” Pompeo told reporters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/significant-evidence-but-no-certainty-coronavirus-from-wuhan-lab-us-secretary-mike-pompeo/story-gQsijrSxxs4y7oLLkExChL.html
06-05-2020||World||Donald Trump reverses himself, will keep task-force ‘indefinitely’||President Donald Trump on Wednesday said he intends to continue the coronavirus task force “indefinitely”, reversing his earlier plans to wind it down. He will repurpose it, however, to focus on “safety and reopening” and “vaccines and therapeutics”.Less than 12 hours ago, the president had told reporters at a mask-making factory in Arizona that the task force, which is spearheading the federal response to the outbreak, has done a good job thus far but he wants to replace it with “something different” for Phase Two, the reopening of the country.The flip-flop was was seen as a reflection of the administration’s continued struggle to come to grips with the public health and economic crisis unleashed by the virus. New accounts have emerged through two whistleblower complaints revealed Tuesday how the administration botched the shortage of medical supplies and focussed on unproven treatments such as the antimalarial hydroxychloroquine.The task-force has done a “fantastic job of bringing together vast highly complex resources”, the president said in a bunch of tweets Wednesday and it will continue “indefinitely with its focus on SAFETY & OPENING UP OUR COUNTRY AGAIN … and will also be very focused on Vaccines & Therapeutics”. He may “add or subtract people”.This was in stark contrast of his intention as he conveyed to reporters Tuesday. The task force has “done a great job”, he said as he toured a mask-making factory in Arizona, adding, “but we’re now looking at a little bit of a different form, and that form is safety and ope. He indicated a “different group” could be set up for what he has said will be “Phase Two”.“You could say there might be a recurrence, and there might be,” he replied to a question about the timing of his plans to disband the task force when experts were warning of recurrence and a surge in numbers. But he said the country will be better prepared for it because “we have learnt a lot about the coronavirus.”But he reassured reporters he will continue to consult with the doctors and experts of the task-force, such as Deborah Birx, the coordinator, and Anthony Fauci, the top epidemiologist who has not hesitated to disagree with the president publicly on everything from treatments and reopening.The American president is in a hurry to reopen the country and seek to reverse the economic downturn unleashed by the virus, with over 30 million jobless, with an eye on his re-election prospects. He has dismissed warnings of resurgences caused by hurried and premature opening.A public model widely cited by the White House and regarded by the broader public health community has projected deaths could double to more than134,000 by August because of the easing of restrictions underway in many states — 42 at last count — from the current toll of over over 71,000.“They want to proclaim it over,” New York Andrew Cuomo said on CNN Tuesday about the president’s plans for the task force.“They have been looking to proclaim it over from day one right?…That is clear. But the virus doesn’t care…doesn’t listen. This is not a marketing situation”Accounts of the Trump administration’s mishandling of the federal response to the outbreak have continued to pile up, in the meantime. New allegations are about the administration’s focus on questionable treatments for Covid-19 such as the se of antimalarial hydroxychloroquine and on the botched response to the shortage of essential supplies such as protective gears and ventilators.Rick Bright, a senior official in the department of health and human services, has alleged in a whistleblower complaint, his warnings about the outbreak made as early as January had been ignored. And once it had hit the US with full force, he was alarmed about the pressure brought on by senior officials to “invest in drugs, vaccines, and other technologies without proper scientific vetting or that lacked scientific merit”.He went on to allege he was so alarmed that he shared with a reporter nonclassified emails between government official about hydroxychloroquine in which they had “discussed the drug’s potential toxicity and demonstrated the political pressure to rush these drugs from Pakistan and India to American households”. Bright claimed he was transferred out shortly after the publication of a news article about the drug.Another whistleblower complaint, also reported Tuesday, details how a group of young, inexperienced volunteers from business consultancy firms and private equity funds pulled together by Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and senior advisor, had grossly mismanaged the acquisition of essential supplies such as masks and ventilators, further complicating shortages in the initial weeks of the epidemic in the united States. They had also prioritized the distribution of supplies to serve people who knew the president or claimed to be close to him..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-reverses-himself-will-keep-task-force-indefinitely/story-oE6rC9fB4IUgmJhswZPZ9J.html
06-05-2020||World||Labour leader Keir Starmer in a bind over ‘repositioning’ India policy||Labour leader Keir Starmer has come under fire for what is seen as ‘repositioning’ its policy on Jammu and Kashmir, which previously had an overtly international and human rights-based focus, but has moved in his bid to rebuild trust with India and the Indian community in the UK.Buffeted by competing demands and claims by the pro-India and pro-Pakistan lobbies in the party, Starmer, who took over from Jeremy Corbyn in April, has been gradually distancing the party from the ‘Corbyn era’, which was seen in sections of the community as being anti-India.Several Labour MPs – particularly those leading pro-Kashmir interests such as Debbie Abrahams, chair of the all-party parliamentary group on Kashmir, who was deported from India in February after Indian officials said she was travelling on a wrong (business) visa that was cancelled – are due to meet Starmer on Thursday to discuss the ‘repositioning’ that sees the Jammu and Kashmir. Several individuals and groups have angrily asked him to reconsider the new approach.There were ripples and more in London and the UK when New Delhi made fundamental changes in the status of Jammu and Kashmir in August 2019, leading to violence outside the Indian high commission and anger in sections of the Indian community against Labour. The ministry of external affairs had rejected a Labour party resolution seen as ‘anti-India.’Starmer last week set out the ‘repositioning’ in a statement with the Labour Friends of India, a lobby group in the party. His focus on building “even stronger business links with India” and conception of the Jammu and Kashmir issue is seen by his critics as betraying human rights values.Starmer said in the statement: “We must not allow issues of the sub-continent to divide communities here. Any constitutional issues in India are a matter for the Indian Parliament and Kashmir is a bilateral issue for India and Pakistan to resolve peacefully. Labour is an internationalist Party and stands for the defence of human rights everywhere”.“A Labour Government under my leadership will be determined to build even stronger business links with India and to co-operate on the global stage on issues such as climate change. I look forward to meeting the Indian high commissioner in due course to open a renewed dialogue between the Labour Party and the people of India,” he added.The Pakistani community in the UK has largely stood by Labour even as large sections of the Indian community have gravitated towards the Conservatives in recent elections. It remains to be seen how the Pakistani community responds politically to Starmer’s perceived pro-India stance, since moving to the Conservatives or the Liberal Democrats is not exactly an option.Starmer wrote to the Hindu Forum of Britain (HFB) last week and made similar points, further riling his critics such as the South Asia Solidarity Group, Momentum Internationalists. The HFB had raised issues such as “caste legislation, anti-India stance and Hinduphobia” in the Labour party.Indian circles remain cautiously optimistic on Starmer’s overtures, viewing his statements as a bid to move on from the Corbyn era, but keenly observing how he deals with the challenge of retaining support of the Pakistani community, which closely identifies with issues related to Jammu and Kashmir.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/labour-leader-keir-starmer-in-a-bind-over-repositioning-india-policy/story-MArxgUppN5bo1yAzk2UeaM.html
06-05-2020||World||Asian Development Bank, Pakistan finalise $305 million emergency Covid loan||The ADB and cash-strapped Pakistan have finalised a USD 305 million emergency Covid-19 loan to help the country buy medical equipment and disburse money to poor women, according to a media report on Wednesday. The Asian Development Bank will extend the loan on commercial terms, The Express Tribune reported. Last month, Pakistan had received an emergency loan of USD 1.39 billion from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and an aid of USD 200 million from the World Bank (WB). While the IMF loan was to boost Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves in the wake of the coronavirus crisis, the WB aid focused on supporting preparedness and emergency response in the health sector. Explaining the need for the ADB loan, Pakistan’s Planning Commission Deputy Chairman Jahanzeb Khan told The Express Tribune that the government was looking at ways to assist those who were directly hit by the virus but could not till now apply for financial help. Pakistan had sent the official loan request to the ADB in March. The USD 305 million package will be combined under the Pakistan National Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan (NEPRP) for Covid-19 which is under the Planning Commission. The NEPRP is worth USD 588 million, which includes a USD 238 million World Bank loan. Out of the USD 305 million loan, USD 200 million is for social protection for vulnerable sections -- cash transfers and unconditional cash transfer instalments -- and USD 105 million for health emergencies like maintaining stores. The novel coronavirus which first surfaced in China’s Wuhan city has claimed over 250,000 lives and infected 3.6 million people across the world. In Pakistan, the virus has killed 526 people with 22,413 confirmed infections. The virus has also adversely hit the country’s economy. On Tuesday, Pakistan requested the members of G-20 nations for debt relief with a commitment of not contracting new non-concessional loans except those allowed under the IMF and World Bank guidelines. The country’s foreign currency reserves had dropped to a four-month low at USD 10.97 billion on April 10, 2020. The reserves had partly depleted due to capital pullout worth around USD 2.69 billion by short-term foreign investors from Pakistan’s debt market over the past five to six weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/asian-development-bank-pakistan-finalise-305-million-emergency-covid-loan/story-2l9cxXIiIhiEWsDdzGxPCO.html

How did it allow the outbreak to develop to the stage today? Is this how a government should be responsible to its people?” she asked.Responding to a question, Hua said as of May 1, China has provided more than 5.3 billion masks, 330 million pairs of surgical gloves, 38.85 million pieces of protective clothing, 5.98 million pairs of goggles, and nearly 7,500 ventilators to the US.“Therefore, the claims about China’s so-called concealment of epidemic situation, delay of notification, and profit from epidemic situation are purely nonsense…,” Hua added.“The most urgent task is to control the outbreak in the U.S. and to save as many lives as possible ... Saving lives should take precedence over political self-interest,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-should-not-weaponise-trade-tariffs-says-china/story-NtWKF6o6thViGSMACauhwK.html
06-05-2020||World||Most US H-1B employers use programme to pay migrants below market wages: Report||A majority of the US H-1B employers, including tech giants like Facebook, Google, Apple and Microsoft, use the temporary work visa programme to pay the migrant workers well below market wages, a new report has claimed.The H-1B is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers from countries like India and China in specialty occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise.Nearly 500,000 migrant workers are employed in the US in the H-1B status.“Among the top 30 H-1B employers are major US firms including Amazon, Microsoft, Walmart, Google, Apple and Facebook. All of them take advantage of program rules in order to legally pay many of their H-1B workers below the local median wage for the jobs they fill,” said the report released by the Economic Policy Institute.Authored by Daniel Costa and Ron Hira, the report titled “H-1B visas and prevailing wage levels” says 60 per cent of H-1B positions certified by the US Department of Labor (DOL) are assigned wage levels well below the local median wage for the occupation.While the H-1B programme rules allow this, the DOL has the authority to change it, but has not, it said. While over 53,000 employers used the H-1B programme in 2019, the top 30 H-1B employers accounted for more than one in four of all 389,000 H-1B petitions approved by the US Citizenship and Immigration Services in 2019, it said.Half of the top 30 H-1B employers use an outsourcing business model to provide staff for third-party clients, rather than employing H-1B workers directly to fill a special need at the company that applies for the visa, the report said.The report alleged that major US-based technology firms that hire H-1B workers directly, rather than contract them out to third-party employers, had significant shares of their certified H-1B positions assigned as Level 1 or Level 2, the two lowest wage levels in fiscal 2019, both of which are below the local median wage.“Until now, much of the public discourse and proposals for reforming H-1B have focused on rules that would constrain the practices of these outsourcing companies,” the report said.But researches reveal that many firms that employ H-1B workers directly, including some of the biggest names in the technology industry such as Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Qualcomm, Salesforce and Uber, pay a large share of their H-1B workers at one of the two lowest wage levels, Level 1 or Level 2.In addition, these direct-hire firms also hire many H-1B workers on a contract basis through outsourcing firms, it added.Microsoft, the seventh-largest H-1B employer in 2019, assigned one-third (35 per cent) of its positions on Labor Condition Applications (LCAs) as Level 1 and two-fifths (42 per cent) as Level 2. In total, Microsoft assigned more than three-quarters (77 per cent) of its H-1B positions as Level 1 or Level 2, a wage level below the local median wage.Microsoft assigned only 18 per cent of its positions as Level 3 (the median) wage, and a mere three per cent as Level 4, the only above-median wage level.Amazon, which appears twice in the H-1B top 30, as “Amazon.com Services” (no. 4 among the biggest H-1B employers) and “Amazon Web Services” (no. 27), also assigned the vast majority of its H-1B positions at one of the two lowest wage levels.According to the report, Amazon.com Services assigned 34 per cent of its H-1B positions as Level 1 and 51 per cent as Level 2, for a total of 86 per cent of all positions certified.Amazon Web Services assigned 47 per cent of its H-1B workers as Level 1 and 36 per cent as Level 2. Combined, Amazon.com Services and Amazon Web Services had 12,428 positions certified at Level 1 or 2, for a total of 85 per cent certified at a wage level below the median. Only one in eight (1,684) were certified at or above the 50th percentile (Level 3 or Level 4), it said.Apple, eleventh on the list, assigned 558 of its H-1B positions (two per cent) as Level 1 and one-third (32 per cent) as Level 2, for a combined total of 34 per cent at Levels 1 and 2. Apple assigned 32 per cent as Level 3 and 34 per cent as Level 4.Google, ranked the fifth-largest H-1B employer, had 9,085 H-1B positions certified by the DOL in fiscal 2019. It assigned less than half of one per cent of its certified H-1B jobs as Level 1 and 54 per cent as Level 2. Only 37 per cent of Google’s jobs were certified at or above the median wage, the report said.Facebook assigned only one position as Level 1 and 10 per cent of its 6,118 total H-1B positions as Level 2. Twenty-five per cent were certified at Level 3 and 16 per cent at Level 4. Nearly half (49 per cent) of Facebook’s H-1B positions were certified at a wage established by an alternative wage survey, making it difficult to assess its H-1B wage distribution, it said.Uber, the 29th-ranked H-1B employer in 2019, had 5,708 H-1B positions certified by the DOL. Less than one per cent was assigned as Level 1 and just over half (53 per cent) as Level 2. Just over one-third were assigned as Level 3 and 13 per cent as Level 4.While Uber had 5,708 H-1B positions certified by DOL and hired 1,160 H-1B workers in 2019, in the same year, it made headlines by laying off 400 employees.The report claims that the top 30 H-1B employers are in fact hiring H-1B workers to fill a very large number of routine (Levels 1 and 2) positions that require relatively little experience and ordinary skills.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/most-us-h-1b-employers-use-programme-to-pay-migrants-below-market-wages-report/story-6vzTqoGjIi6bp53r98hxFO.html

Catherine Calderwood, chief medical officer of Scotland, had resigned in April after it was revealed she visited her second home during the lockdown.Ferguson was a member of the influential Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, which has been meeting daily and contributing to the government response to the coronavirus pandemic. The police have been given new powers to enforce lockdown curbs.Health secretary Matt Hancock said Ferguson had made the right decision to resign, adding he would support police action against the expert. According to him, flouting the lockdown rules by Ferguson was “extraordinary,” and left him “speechless”.“Prof Ferguson is a very, very eminent and impressive scientist and the science he’s done has been an important part of what we’ve listened to, and I think he took the right decision to resign,” Hancock said.Johnson faced Prime Minister’s Questions in the House of Commons for the first time after recovering from coronavirus on Wednesday, when Labour leader Keir Starmer subjected him to forensic questioning.Starmer alleged that the government had been slow to lockdown, slow to test, slow to trace and slow on providing personal protection equipment, which led to the UK registering the worst death toll in Europe.Johnson acknowledged that the capacity to test in initial stages was limited: “It’s easier to do now on the way out than it was as the epidemic took off. And I think most people with common sense can see the particular problems we had at the time.” He set a new target of 200,000 tests a day by the end of May.Meanwhile, chancellor Rishi Sunak indicated that the wage-subsidy scheme to pay 80 per cent of furloughed staff up to a limit of 2,500 pounds per month from March to June is likely to be wound down as part of plans to remove lockdown measures.As the number of UK jobless due to the pandemic grew, Johnson told MPs he would announce plans to gradually ease lockdown measures on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/key-uk-govt-advisor-flouts-covid-19-lockdown-rules-quits/story-6ntIL3iMsBNSr0fsU2qewO.html

06-05-2020||World||Members of Islamic State-Haqqani network arrested over Kabul attacks||Afghan security forces arrested eight members of a network grouping Islamic State and Haqqani militants responsible for bloody attacks in the capital including on Sikh worshippers, the country’s security agency said on Wednesday.The arrests were made as special forces carried out a raid on a property in Kabul on Tuesday evening, seizing weapons and explosives and killing five members of the joint network.The group was responsible for shootings of worshippers at a Sikh complex and at a large ceremony attended by many in the Hazara community, as well as rocket attacks on President Ashraf Ghani’s swearing-in ceremony and on Bagram airbase, the National Directorate of Security said in a statement.Gunmen and suicide bombers raided a Sikh religious complex in Kabul in March, killing 25 people. That was the second attack on a minority group claimed by Islamic State in a month after more than 30 people were shot dead in a gathering attended by many members of the ethnic Hazara community marking the anniversary of the death of a Hazara leader.Also in March, attackers fired rockets at Ghani’s inauguration ceremony and in April sent rockets into the Bagram airbase, though no one was killed in either attack.The violence underscored the challenges to securing lasting peace in Afghanistan even after the United States signed a troop withdrawal agreement with the militant Taliban in February. The Islamist group has since held off on large-scale attacks on foreign forces or in major centres, though it has continued attacking Afghan security forces throughout the provinces.Islamic State, which is not a party to the agreement and has fought the Taliban in the past, has a small presence in Afghanistan, largely in the north, though it has waged high profile attacks further south in the capital.The militant Haqqani network, founded in the 1970s, is one of the most powerful and feared groups in the Afghan insurgency and has in the past had links to the Taliban.

She reiterated that the United States should stop shifting its responsibilities over Covid-19 and said accusations that China deliberately spread the virus are baseless.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-says-tariffs-should-not-be-used-as-weapons-after-us-threats/story-qrlraqjl1Z8kSiwVnk3rQI.html

The United States, which exited the deal in 2018, says it wants to extend the embargo.In a speech on Wednesday, Rouhani repeated Iran’s longstanding criticism of Washington’s decision to exit the nuclear deal, which he called a “stupid mistake”.“If America wants to return to the deal, it should lift all the sanctions on Tehran and compensate for the reimposition of sanctions,” said Rouhani, a pragmatist whose rhetoric towards the United States is frequently more measured than that of some officials. “Iran will give a crushing response if the arms embargo on Tehran is extended,” Rouhani added. Iran has gradually rolled back its commitments under the accord in response to the U.S. decision to quit, but says it wants the agreement to remain in place. It has criticised European parties to the deal for failing to salvage the pact by shielding its economy from U.S. sanctions.“Iran’s nuclear steps are reversible if other parties to the deal fulfil their obligations and preserve Tehran’s interests under the pact,” Rouhani said.

Whether it was Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin or Saddam Hussein, these rulers made the world tremble in fear.Same is the case with Kim Jong Un, who rules North Korea. The entire international media was abuzz with the news of his extremely poor health in recent days after reportedly undergoing a heart surgery. Some media outlets, especially those in the South Korea, even claimed that Kim won’t survive.But days later, the North Korean media released photographs of the leader at a ribbon-cutting ceremony, which the media said was held during the inauguration of a fertiliser plant.Kim looked in a jovial mood in those pictures; he was even smiling. And since then, several theories emerged on the internet about his health.One such theory, picked up by British publication Daily Mail, claims that Kim used a body double at the May 1 ceremony. It posted several photographs of the 36-year-old leader doing the rounds on the internet to describe how his facial features looked different.The most notable difference highlighted in those photographs are in his dentition. The teeth looked doctored, the Daily Mail report claimed.Lending credence to the theory is former Tory MP Louise Mensch. “No it isn’t. Teeth, Cupid’s bow, others. Totally different. Look at those gnashes, if you must,” she said in her tweet posted on May 2. No it isn’t. Teeth, Cupid’s bow, others. Totally different. Look at those gnashes, if you must. pic.twitter.com/efPmn0f5ox“That’s what I thought. Something is just a little bit off,” tweeted a user Carlette Jones. That's what I thought. Something is just a little bit off.“but have to know what disorder he had because there is a chance his face is a little puffed up from meds or his condition. Teeth aren’t the same.

He reduced public activity due to coronavirus concerns, they said.“Kim Jong Un had focused on consolidating internal affairs such as military forces and party-state meetings, and coronavirus concerns have further limited his public activity,” a member of South Korea’s National Intelligence Service Kim Byung-kee said.Kim’s visit to the fertiliser factory appeared to be aimed at expressing his resolve to ease food shortages and build a self-reliant economy, Kim Byung-kee further said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-uses-a-body-double-claims-report-highlights-photos-from-his-appearance/story-Zzwj74n3CjnJql5M68bTaJ.html

Johnson is expected to set out a plan for exiting the lockdown on Sunday.

06-05-2020||World||All you need to know about the Wuhan lab at the heart of the US-China virus spat||The Chinese laboratory accused by top American officials of being the source of the coronavirus pandemic conducts research on the world’s most dangerous diseases.US President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have both claimed that there is evidence the pathogen came from the lab in Wuhan -- the city where the disease was first detected late last year.But the World Health Organization said Washington had offered no evidence to support the “speculative” claims, and scientists believe the coronavirus jumped from animals to humans, possibly at a Wuhan market selling wild animals.The top US epidemiologist Anthony Fauci has echoed the WHO’s statement, telling National Geographic that all evidence so far “strongly indicates” a natural origin.China has strongly denied the allegations, but speculation and conspiracy theories have persisted.Here are some key questions about the Wuhan Institute of Virology:What do its researchers do?Work by the lab’s scientists helped to shed light on the COVID-19 pathogen in the early days of the outbreak in Wuhan.In February, they published work concluding that the new virus shared a 79.6 percent sequence identity to the SARS coronavirus, and that it was 96 percent identical at the whole-genome level to a coronavirus found in bats.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe lab’s researchers had already conducted extensive investigations on the links between bats and disease outbreaks in China, and had highlighted the need to prepare for viruses potentially spreading out of their natural reservoirs into human communities.Scientists think COVID-19 originated in bats and could have been transmitted to people via another mammal like a pangolin, but there is no definitive answer so far.What does it handle? The Wuhan institute houses the largest virus bank in Asia which preserves more than 1,500 strains.The complex contains Asia’s first maximum-security lab equipped to handle Class 4 pathogens (P4) such as Ebola.The 300-million-yuan ($42 million) P4 lab opened in 2018. A P3 lab has been in operation since 2012.While the US intelligence community said it had concluded the coronavirus was not human-made, it added that it would continue to investigate if the outbreak started from contact with infected animals or from “an accident” at the Wuhan lab.Could there be a leak? US diplomatic cables seen by The Washington Post earlier said that officials were concerned about inadequate safety standards related to researchers’ handling of SARS-like bat coronaviruses in the high-security lab.The institute has said it received samples of the then-unknown virus on December 30, determined the viral genome sequence on January 2 and submitted information on the pathogen to the WHO on January 11.Shi Zhengli, one of China’s leading experts on bat coronaviruses and deputy director of the Wuhan P4 lab, said she would “bet her life that (the new coronavirus) had nothing to do with the lab”, according to Chinese state media.And in an interview with Scientific American, Shi said the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence did not match any of the bat coronaviruses her laboratory had previously collected and studied.What do scientists know about the virus? Researchers have noted that while there is no proof for the lab accident theory, there is also no clear evidence that the virus came from the Wuhan market.A study by a group of Chinese scientists published in The Lancet in January found that the first COVID-19 patient had no connection to the market, and neither did 13 of the first 41 confirmed cases.Professor Leo Poon of The University of Hong Kong said the scientific community’s consensus was that the virus is not human-made.“We need to look at the origin of this virus. It is important, because from a public health point of view, we want to know how it happened, and (if we can) learn from this,” he said.David Heymann, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, added: “We have a hypothesis that it came from a live animal market, and I haven’t seen anybody provide evidence that shows to the contrary.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/all-you-need-to-know-about-the-wuhan-lab-at-the-heart-of-the-us-china-virus-spat/story-FUamWGJlBmyp5IjJ6k5wrL.html

More than 2.5 lakh people have died due to Covid-19 globally while over one million have recovered from the disease.The United States, Spain, Italy, France, the UK are some of the top affected countries in the world. The United States has reported over one million Covid-19 cases so far while Europe remains the worst-hit continent. Here are the key coronavirus updates from the globe:1. After his hospitalisation for Covid-19, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson will make his first appearance in parliament on Wednesday.2. Russia recorded over 10,000 new coronavirus cases for the fourth day in a row on Wednesday. The country has the sixth-highest number of confirmed Covid-19 infections in the world with around 165,929 people infected from the virus.3. The United Kingdom has overtaken Italy to report the highest official death toll from coronavirus disease Covid-19 in Europe, second in the world after the United States.4. US President Donald Trump on Tuesday said that as the country takes steps to reopen economy, more Americans will die of Covid-19. “It’s possible there will be some... because you won’t be locked into an apartment or a house or whatever it is,” he said.5.

President Vladimir Putin was set to chair a government meeting to discuss a gradual withdrawal from virus lockdown later on Wednesday.Moscow, which has emerged as the epicentre of the pandemic in Russia, has recorded 85,973 cases and 866 deaths.Despite the sharp rise in cases, Russia’s official fatality rate has remained low in comparison to countries including Italy, Spain and the United States.Officials credit quick moves to close the country’s borders, as well as widespread testing and tracking of infections, but critics have cast doubt on the numbers.as/mm/txw||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-sees-over-10-000-new-covid-19-cases-for-fourth-day-in-row/story-4ydLq7FBtJEcu1vuktbK4I.html
06-05-2020||World||Rishi Sunak to look at all options to bring UK furlough support to end||Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak is examining ways to move millions of workers off government support and back into their jobs as the U.K. leaves its lockdown.In March, as the U.K. went into lockdown to slow the spread of coronavirus, Sunak announced a furlough program where workers received 80% of their wage to stay home.It’s now supporting more than 6.3 million people at a cost of billions of pounds, and the chancellor has to find a way to ease them off it. Amid the debate about how to wind down aid, the British Chambers of Commerce said Wednesday that most U.K. businesses could be up and running days after restrictions are lifted, with smaller firms primed to return the quickest.A government official said Sunak was working through policy options this week, with no decisions taken and everything still on the table.Options reported in newspapers include reducing the subsidy to 60%, to encourage people to go back to work, and allowing people to work while receiving a smaller subsidy, possibly as a way of helping businesses restart slowly.Getting the exit from the plan right is crucial if the U.K. is to avoid worsening an already perilous employment situation. The Resolution Foundation warned Wednesday that the crisis could see youth unemployment spike by 600,000 this year, taking it above 1 million.Expensive SupportThe government support for jobs is expected to cost 39 billion pounds ($48 billion). If it runs too long, it will cost more. But if Sunak ends it too abruptly, businesses short of money may have to lay off staff, negating the point of the program.More than 800,000 employers are using the program, and he has promised there will be no cliff edge end to the support. BCC Director General Adam Marshall echoed that sentiment in an interview with Bloomberg TV on Wednesday.“Firms are going to have to have access to it for some time to come because not every business can open at the same pace,” he said. “We caution against just breaking it down by sector because if you withdrew support from some firms that are in the supply chains of these businesses but kept support to others, you could see some supply chains collapse.”According to the BCC survey, almost two-thirds of companies with fewer than 10 employees and half of large businesses said they could be ready within a week.The poll, conducted April 29-May 1 found, suggests commerce could ramp up fairly quickly following the lifting of the lockdown, although questions remain about how businesses will be impacted by continued social distancing rules.The timing of any easing is still uncertain. A decision on whether to extend the lockdown is due this week, with every indication that Prime Minister Boris Johnson will say the closures of schools and most shops needs to continue. But he is likely to set out a pathway back to normality, once scientists are sure that coronavirus can be kept under control.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rishi-sunak-to-look-at-all-options-to-bring-uk-furlough-support-to-end/story-pEzTyeX4zTVQ6O8SYD05DJ.html
06-05-2020||World||UK now has second-highest Covid-19 toll after United States, data shows||The United Kingdom has overtaken Italy to report the highest official death toll from coronavirus disease Covid-19 in Europe, figures released on Tuesday showed.Weekly figures from Britain’s Office for National Statistics (ONS) added more than 7,000 deaths in England and Wales in the week to April 24, raising the total for the United Kingdom to 32,313. Italy said on Tuesday that it has recorded 29,316 virus fatalities to date.Only the United States, with a population nearly five times greater, has suffered more confirmed fatalities from the virus than Britain, according to the data so far. Nearly 69,000 have died in the pandemic there.Italy and Spain, the next worst-hit European countries, have smaller populations than Britain, further complicating comparisons.“Putting a graph out with the United States at the top and UK second is not helpful, but once you start to break it down by looking at the population we should be seriously asking questions about what’s different,” Carl Heneghan, professor of evidence-based medicine at Oxford University, told news agency Reuters.British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab urged against trying to make reliable international comparisons.“There are different ways of counting deaths... we now publish data that includes all deaths in all settings and not all countries do that,” he said at the daily Downing Street press conference.“Can you reliably know that all countries are measuring in the same way? And it also depends on how good, frankly, countries are in gathering their statistics.”Tuesday’s updated statistics means Britain has probably had the highest official death numbers in Europe for days.But the weekly ONS data also shows that the peak in Covid-19 deaths has likely passed, although the week to April 24 was still the second-deadliest since comparable records began being kept in 1993.Britain, in its seventh week of an economically crippling lockdown, is trying to implement a new contact tracing strategy so it can ease the measures.Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to set out his plan to lift the stringent social distancing regime next Sunday, according to media reports.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-now-has-second-highest-covid-19-toll-after-united-states-data-shows/story-rGlVOptjpfg3daLqCDOXcO.html

Officials there say it has created a gap in the global fight against the coronavirus and threatened the island’s health.Speaking to foreign reporters in Taipei, Health Minister Chen Shih-chung said Taiwan wanted proper access to the WHO.“For Taiwan, what we want is first-hand information. Any second-hand information slows down any actions we take, and distorts our judgement about the epidemic, like we’re unable to see the woods for the trees,” he said.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic“But if we can we get first-hand information within the organisation, we can see the whole picture and can react proactively by creating various systems or policies,” he added.“Our speed in reacting will become faster, so Taiwan does not become a gap” in epidemic prevention.Taiwan has produced a list of complaints against the WHO, including that it gave wrong case numbers for Taiwan, ignored requests for information, and has bent to Chinese pressure to interfere with the island’s requests for help.Both the WHO and China say Taiwan has been provided with the help it needs. China says only it has the right to speak for Taiwan’s 23 million people internationally, a claim Taipei’s democratically elected government angrily rejects.Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreakTaiwan has stepped up its campaign to attend, as an observer, this month’s virtual meeting of the WHO’s decision-making body, the World Health Assembly (WHA), though government and diplomatic sources say China will not agree to that.Taiwan attended the World Health Assembly as an observer from 2009-2016, when Taipei-Beijing relations were warmer.But China blocked further participation after the election of Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, whom China views as a separatist, a charge she rejects.Chen would not say whether he was optimistic or pessimistic about Taiwan’s chances of participating, but said there was “of course no problem” in trying to reach a consensus to allow this to happen.“Our only standard is that we cannot be belittled,” he said.Steven Solomon, the WHO’s principal legal officer, said on Monday that the WHO recognised the People’s Republic of China as the “one legitimate representative of China”, in keeping with U.N. policy since 1971, and that the question of Taiwan’s attendance was one for the WHO’s 194 member states.Taiwan says the 1971 decision, under which Beijing assumed the U.N. China seat from Taipei, only resolved the issue of who represented China, not the issue of Taiwan, and did not grant China the power to represent Taiwan internationally.Chen said the world should not be locked in the past and have to stick by something from almost five decades ago.“The times keep changing,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/give-us-first-hand-information-to-fight-virus-taiwan-asks-who/story-EukffgnuFVlFSMV8dzXDbO.html

Increased suspicions also threatened to hurt US-China cooperation to fight the disease and restart the global economy.“It is time to end the blame game,” Cui said. “It is time to focus on the disease and rebuild trust between our two countries.”Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicTrump and his top aides have increasingly faulted China for the coronavirus’s deadly expansion across the US and around the world. The pathogen has killed more Americans than the Vietnam War, pushed the US economy toward recession and clouded Trump’s re-election prospects.‘Conspiracy Theories’While Trump has accused China of a cover-up and trying to hurt him politically, US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo has gone further, claiming there is “enormous evidence” that the virus escaped from a high-security virology laboratory near the first known outbreak in Wuhan. Pompeo has advanced the theory despite Chinese denials and a lack of consensus among US intelligence agencies examining the virus’s origins.Although Cui made no mention of the lab claim, he denounced “conspiracy theories” about China’s geopolitical intentions. He also rejected calls for China to pay reparations for the damage wrought by the virus, saying similar responsibility wasn’t laid on countries where H1N1 or AIDS originated.Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreak“There is no denying that the first known case of Covid-19 was reported in Wuhan,” Cui said. “But this means only that Wuhan was the first victim of the virus. To ask a victim for compensation is simply ridiculous.”Cui has been seeking to ratchet down tensions with the US which have steadily escalated since he became ambassador in 2013. In March, Cui criticized a foreign ministry spokesman’s tweets about whether the virus was introduced to Wuhan by US Army athletes. Last month, he urged cooperation in a similar column published in the New York Times.Cui’s latest op-ed closed with a reference to the Republican Party’s first president, Abraham Lincoln, who Trump has been invoking as his re-election campaign heats up. “As President Abraham Lincoln called for ‘the better angels’ in his inauguration speech, I hope that the wisdom of preceding generations will guide us to choose the right side of history and work for our shared future together,” Cui said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-ambassador-to-us-urges-end-to-blame-game-over-pandemic/story-EqEGEhlgMtQawvKl2vnd1O.html
06-05-2020||World||Peru’s 35-year-old finance minister is suddenly a rock star||Everyone calls her Toni. Mothers take selfies of her with their children, and street hawkers push bracelets into her hand as presents. Artists sketch her portrait and post them to social media. TV networks vie for interviews and run profiles asking, “Who is Maria Antonieta Alva?”The answer: She’s the 35-year-old finance minister of Peru steering an ambitious recovery package during a devastating pandemic, and she is winning praise for its generosity to small businesses and ordinary citizens.“From a Latin perspective, Peru is a clear leader in terms of macro response,” said Ricardo Hausmann, a Harvard economist who was Alva’s professor and is leading a team of experts advising Peru and 10 other countries on mitigating the effects of coronavirus. “You could have imagined a very different outcome if Toni weren’t there.”Appointed only last October, Alva is increasingly seen as a central figure in President Martin Vizcarra’s cabinet, part of a rising generation of new leaders, and spends a great deal of time explaining public policy to a nervous public.“She’s very good at communicating and that’s become much more important in the current context,” said Carlos Oliva, Alva’s predecessor in the post.While Alva’s the only woman, she is part of a group of millennial finance ministers in the region, including Argentina’s Martin Guzman, 37, the Dominican Republic’s Juan Ariel Jimenez, 35, and Ecuador’s Richard Martinez, 39.These aren’t easy times to oversee policy and it remains to be seen whether Alva survives. Some economists forecast a drop in GDP of more than 10% this year, the worst in decades, along with mass unemployment. She also has to contend with a populist agenda from the congress (where the government has no representation) that undermines the ministry’s, with elections less than a year away.Her office said Alva wasn’t available for an interview.Back to GrowthAlva’s initial focus was on reversing a slump in government infrastructure outlays by helping regional and local authorities spend faster, which led to a record increase in public investment. She wanted to reduce deficits in health, education and infrastructure, and get Peru back to growth after a decade-low 2.2% rate last year.Since the pandemic broke -- and it has hit Peru especially hard despite an early severe lockdown -- her focus switched to containment, including aid for families and businesses, and preparing for a reactivation with this month’s reopening.The daughter of Jorge Alva, a civil engineer who’s rector of the Universidad Nacional de Ingenieria (and a former teacher of Vizcarra), Alva has said she was exposed to the extreme poverty in Peru as a child when she accompanied her father on visits to its hinterland, and was determined to change things.In a region known for its machismo, where female accomplishment is often largely seen through the prism of motherhood, Alva cuts an unusual figure, decked out in no-nonsense clothes and a distinctive piece of jewelry: a gold necklace with a pendant in the shape of Peru.“She’s strong but not aggressive,” observed Patricia Zarate, head of polling at the Institute of Peruvian Studies. “She shows it through her work. It’s a different type of female empowerment.”‘Just Machismo’Some sneered at her ministerial appointment, saying she was there because she was someone’s daughter rather than because of her years in public finance. “It’s impossible not to think this is just machismo,” she said at the time. “If I were a man, that wouldn’t necessarily have been called into question.”Alva attended a Peruvian university and then got a masters in public administration from Harvard in 2014. She spent most of the past decade working for the government in public planning and expenditure, including two years overseeing the country’s $52-billion national budget.Just months into her ministerial tenure, epidemiologists presented the government with a dilemma -- lock down the population, including millions of shopkeepers, artisans and street sellers who live hand-to-mouth, or the health system risks collapsing under the strain of virus patients.After consulting economists in Peru and overseas, she negotiated with cabinet colleagues to build a consensus for an array of solutions including cash handouts, payroll subsidies and government-backed business loans, none of which had been tried before in Peru.“It’s been her push within the government that has led to such a clear articulation of the measures and the response,” said Jaime Reusche, an analyst at Moody’s Investors Service.Two weeks ago, Peru sold $3 billion of bonds in the international market at record low rates in a show of investor confidence.Country of ParadoxesPeru, with 32 million inhabitants, is a country of paradoxes. It has internationally recognized economic institutions and large foreign reserves, yet health care and education are among the most under-funded in the Americas.As a student Alva was troubled by those contradictions and by ongoing inequality and poverty, said Enrique Vasquez, who taught her at Universidad del Pacifico in Lima. While studying, she co-founded a charity to help poor children attend university and started a public-policy debate group. Upon graduation, she went to the Finance Ministry.She attended Harvard on scholarship and spent two months in India studying educational opportunities for girls. She returned to Peru to work at the Education Ministry, becoming head of planning and budget, before returning to the Finance Ministry to oversee the budget and a team of more than 150 people.It hasn’t been all smooth sailing as a minister. For many, the cash handouts are arriving too slowly, meaning the lockdown has left them with no income, food or shelter. As the virus digs deep, thousands who’ve lost jobs are leaving Lima and returning to their home provinces in desperation.In February, the chairman of Peru’s state oil company, Petroperu, quit after calling Alva stupid in a taped, expletive-laden conversation, for not authorizing $1.5 billion in financing. Days later, a group of university students draped banners over 18 highway bridges supporting Alva.Last week, there were rumors on social media of her resignation amid claims that her family was benefiting from the rescue package. She denied the resignation and said her finances were publicly available online.Vasquez, the professor, recalled a conversation he had with her when she was a student. “I said to her, ‘Toni, I hope one day you get the chance to be president of Peru. But you’re going to need to be minister first.’ She just smiled.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/peru-s-35-year-old-finance-minister-is-suddenly-a-rock-star/story-MSoxNx1mIee2M1J13ixVzL.html
06-05-2020||World||UK scientist behind lockdown quits after breaking social distancing rules||A top scientist who advised British leaders on coronavirus lockdown measures said on Tuesday he had resigned from a key government panel after admitting to breaking the country’s rules on social distancing.Professor Neil Ferguson, an epidemiologist on the advisory team helping the UK coordinate its pandemic response, stepped down following media reports that he had allowed a woman to visit him at home.“I accept I made an error of judgement and took the wrong course of action,” he said.“I deeply regret any undermining of the clear messages around the continued need for social distancing to control this devastating epidemic.”The scientist said he had “stepped back” from his role on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies. A government spokesman confirmed his resignation.Britain, the world’s second worst-hit country after the US with more than 32,000 coronavirus deaths, imposed strict stay-at-home orders in late March.The government had ramped up its response to the crisis after research by Ferguson and his colleagues at Imperial College London warned that Covid-19 infections and deaths would spiral without drastic action.Ferguson’s resignation came after the Daily Telegraph reported that a woman, said to be his “lover”, came to his home in London on two occasions during the lockdown.“I acted in the belief that I was immune, having tested positive for coronavirus, and completely isolated myself for almost two weeks after developing symptoms,” the professor said.He added: “The government guidance is unequivocal, and is there to protect all of us.”Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who was hospitalised by the disease and has now recovered, ordered the initial three-week lockdown on March 23.Under the measures, “non-essential” shops and services were shut while residents were told not to go out except for exercise and to buy essential items. Police were given powers to fine those flouting the rules.The lockdown was extended for another three weeks in mid-April, but Johnson is soon expected to set out his plan to lift the stringent rules, according to media reports.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-scientist-behind-lockdown-quits-after-breaking-social-distancing-rules/story-ivlT1pBPR0EbUwjxDv9kOM.html
06-05-2020||World||All you need to know about murder hornets which have invaded US||A giant species of bees have reached the US shores and are threatening the native population of insects there. Vespa Mandarinia, dubbed as murder hornets, were first discovered in Washington by a beekeeper and have alarmed the agricultural scientists.These giant bees though generally do not attack the humans or pets, but once threatened they can sting humans too. And their multiple stings can even kill them.Here are some things to know about murder hornets:• The stinging Vespa mandarinia can grow as large as 2-1/2 inches (6.4 cm) in length. They have a large orange/yellow head with prominent eyes, black and yellow striped abdomen and form large colonies that usually nest in the ground.• The species is native to Southeast Asia, China and Taiwan.• The murder hornets present a danger to agriculture and the apiary industry, because the insect is known to attack honey bees, with a few of the hornets capable of wiping out an entire hive in hours.• The Washington State Agricultural Department said that the murder hornets leave piles of dead bees, most of them headless, outside their beehive.• Scientists don’t know for sure how the Murder Hornet made its way to Blaine. The most likely scenario is that it arrived on a container ship docking at one of Washington’s ports. Intentional transport of the killer bug into the United States would violate federal law.• Their stinger is longer than that of a honeybee and their venom is more toxic. Typical beekeeping protective clothing is not sufficient to protect you from stings.• A report in the New York Times said that around 50 people are killed every year by murder hornets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/all-you-need-to-know-about-murder-hornets-which-have-invaded-us/story-p5JimZJxHDWVbdNxjm85gL.html
06-05-2020||World||After Covid-19, US now battles murder hornets which threaten humans too||The United States is already battling the deadly coronavirus pandemic, and it has a new problem to deal with: Murder hornets.The invasive and predatory insect has turned up in Washington state near the Canadian border, where they could potentially pose a threat to humans and the beekeeping industry.The stinging Vespa Mandarinia can grow as large as 2.5 inches in length and is native to Southeast Asia, China and Taiwan. It was first discovered in Blaine, Washington, in December by a homeowner though authorities are not sure how they reached the US.“An Asian giant hornet can sting you multiple times and deliver larger doses of venom just because of the size of them. The venom itself is fairly toxic and creates localized necrosis around the wound so you’ll see melting flesh around the wound,” managing entomologist at the Washington state Agriculture Department Sven-Erik Spichiger told news agency Reuters.“The hornets enter a slaughter phase where they kill bees by decapitating them. They then defend the hive as their own, taking the brood to feed their own young,” according to the official website of the Washington State Department of Agriculture. A few hornets can destroy a hive in a matter of hours, it further said.Scientists in the US are now hunting for the hornets, in a bid to eradicate the species before they wipe out the bee population in the country.While the hornets usually don’t attack people or pets, they can do so if threatened. Their stinger is longer than that of a honeybee and their venom is more toxic. They can also sting repeatedly. Multiple stings can kill humans, agricultural scientists in the US said.A report in the New York Times said that murder hornet stings are believed to cause “as many of 50 human fatalities every year”.The insects are roughly the size of a matchbox and have large yellow-red heads and a black-yellow striped body.“They’re like something out of a monster cartoon with this huge yellow-orange face,” Susan Cobey, a bee breeder with Washington State University’s entomology department, said in a press release on Monday.The Vespa Mandarinia is the largest existing species of hornets in the world, according to the Washington State Department of Agriculture.Canada had also discovered Asian giant hornet in two locations in British Columbia in the fall of 2019, it further said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-covid-19-us-now-battles-murder-hornets-which-threaten-humans-too/story-DQKoQakrsr87kl8W4iOs7J.html

06-05-2020||World||‘Pakistan is China’s colonial vassal’: Former Pentagon official||With souring relationship with Washington and growing business and strategic ties with Beijing, Pakistan is leading nothing more than a colony of China, said Dr Michael Rubin, a former Pentagon official.Pakistan joined hands with neighbouring China since after America’s growing relationship with India, a democratic nation having the world’s second-largest population.Rubin believes that Pakistani leaders see in China strategic depth, an ally able to deter Indian retaliation across the line-of-control, and a partner unlikely to criticise Pakistani corruption, its poor treatment of religious minorities and its internal human rights record.For China, Pakistan can be a major market, provide land links into West Asia, and a strategic port at Gwadar.In his article published by The National Interest, Rubin said, “Pakistanis will soon realise -- if they have not already -- what a devil’s bargain their country has made. In China, Pakistan has tied itself to a country that is responsible for the incarceration in concentration camps of one million Muslims solely on the basis of their religion and it has partnered with a country that thinks nothing about killing Pakistanis and humiliating Pakistan.”Now, it is also increasingly clear that the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) may be becoming a major road for transmission into Pakistan and, more broadly, South Asia.“While Pakistan has struggled with moderate succeed in stamping out hotspots where the coronavirus has erupted, communities living along the corridor in Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, Punjab, Sindh and Balochistan are fearful that Chinese trade and traffic along the corridor as well as its expedition of internal Pakistani commerce across regions, could enable the epidemic to spread like a wildfire. It may be this pressure which is leading Prime Minister Imran Khan to lift Pakistan’s lockdown prematurely,” said the article.Rubin said that the full danger of spread along the CPEC may not yet be apparent. Weather blocks corridor passes during winter, but as spring thaws the ice and snow, commerce usually explodes.Many Chinese workers had also returned home for the Chinese New Year, which coincided with necessary winter-related construction delay. But several hundred Chinese workers have now returned to Pakistan to work on the project, bringing the total numbers of Chinese workers on different CPEC projects to between 10,000 and 15,000.“There is no indication that China has set up any testing and quarantine sites for CPEC workers in Pakistan,” he said.Dr Rubin added, “Gilgit-Baltistan may be the canary in the coal mine as locals suffer for the sake of Pakistan’s China partnership. It is one of Pakistan’s harder-hit regions. It has only one testing centre and can test only fifteen people daily. While there are reportedly nine ventilators in the region, local doctors estimate they need at least two hundred of them. Pakistani officials have long neglected the region, even while working to strip away its right to self-rule.”Pakistani authorities in Islamabad may accept Chinese assurances in order not to hurt Pakistan’s bottom line and insult Beijing, never mind that it was Chinese lies and obfuscation that enabled the epidemic to spread so far in the first place.“It has been easy for Pakistani nationalists to use anti-Americanism and grievances real or imagined in order to shirk responsibility for their own actions and cynically drive a wedge between Islamabad and Washington. China has simultaneously courted Pakistan as Islamabad looked for new partners. Pakistanis may soon recognise, however, that China seeks not a partner, but a colonial vassal, the deaths of whose citizens it sees as wholly irrelevant,” said the former Pentagon official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-not-pakistan-s-key-partner-but-colonial-vassal-former-pentagon-official/story-4kan7FFgiVw36aGRNjs8WL.html
06-05-2020||World||White House begins talks on winding down coronavirus task force, says Mike Pence||The Trump administration has initiated talks on winding down the White House Task Force on coronavirus and gradually delegating its responsibilities to the relevant federal agencies, US Vice President Mike Pence said on Tuesday.Pence leads the task force.“I think we are having conversations about that and about what the proper time is for the task force to complete its work and for the ongoing efforts to take place on an agency-by-agency level,” Pence told a select group of reporters.The White House has already begun to talk about a transition plan with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), he said.The news was first reported by The New York Times.In Arizona, President Donald Trump also confirmed the news.“I think we are looking at phase two and we are looking at other phases,” he said, adding that the country is starting to open up and noting that the task force has done “a phenomenal job”.Responding to a question, Trump indicated that the task force has done an incredible job. The president said he would not need to consult certain people, such as those who worked on ventilators.“We will have something in a different form,” he said, describing the need to focus on both safety and reopening.Asked why is now the time to wind down the task force if there could be a recurrence, he said, “Because we cannot close our country down for the next five years. The administration has learned a lot.” The president noted that health experts believe there could be a recurrence but they would need to “put it out”.By Tuesday, more than 71,000 Americans had died in the last three months due to coronavirus and the number of those infected crossed 12 lakh, the highest across the world. But with the decline in the number of new cases and fatalities over the last one week, quite a few states have started opening up.“It really is all a reflection of the tremendous progress we have made as a country. The president stood up the White House Coronavirus Task Force in January to marshal a national response,” Pence told reporters at the White House.As the head of the task force, Pence has held daily meetings with its members comprising eminent doctors, health experts, heads of multiple federal agencies and cabinet members.“As I have said before, as we continue to practise social distancing and states engage in safe and responsible reopening plans, I truly believe -- and the trend lines support it -- that we could be in a very different place. And by late May and early June -- and that probably represents the timetable for our agencies,” he said.Responding to a question, Pence said the task force might be closed by early June.“I think we are starting to look at the Memorial Day window, early June window, as a time when we could begin to transition back to having our agencies to manage our national response in a more traditional manner,” he said.Dr Deborah Birx, a member of the task force, said the White House will “continue to review and analyse data and work with the departments in agencies to help that data inform their decision-making processes”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-begins-talks-on-winding-down-coronavirus-task-force-says-us-vice-president-pence/story-ip0uUiIIrzzk0cX01Ue76O.html

After much thought, he made the difficult decision to shave his beard off.”Sanjeet told the Montreal Gazette, “But because Covid-19 has become so rampant in our community, it just wasn’t feasible anymore (not to wear a N-95 mask). There are so many people coming in. I felt I just couldn’t sit on the sidelines. This was an exception to the rule, so we had to do what we had to do to help out.”Canada’s total coronavirus death toll rose to 3,915 on Tuesday, up about four per cent from 3,766 on Monday, according to official data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sikh-doctors-in-canada-make-extremely-difficult-decision-to-serve-covid-19-patients/story-dNIx5zeXWEkCdCkWFos2jK.html

While the Indian Government has now announced that citizens will be brought back, with 12 countries in the initial list, Indian officials in Canada have already started preparations for the repatriation flights.India’s High Commissioner to Ottawa Ajay Bisaria said that the mission’s website had posted a registration form for those seeking to return and in less than 24 hours since the announcement in India, it recorded over 2,000 entries. “As a contingency planning exercise, the High Commission of India in Canada is preparing a list of distressed Indian citizens in Canada,” a release from the High Commission said.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageOfficials are hopeful that Canada will be in a part of the second phase of repatriation. Among the categories outlined are Indians who have been laid off from their jobs in Canada, those facing expiry of their visa, those in a medical emergency, elderly or pregnant women, tourists or visitors stuck in Canada or students who are stuck as their educational institutions have closed down. The cost is likely to about Rs 100,000 for the one-way ticket aboard the non-scheduled commercial flight operated by Air India.Those returning from Canada will not require a Covid-19 negative certification because that is not issued in the country, but they will be subject to the norms notified by the government. Medical screening will be undertaken prior to embarkation and only asymptomatic passengers will be allowed to travel. People who have compelling reasons for travel will also have to sign an agreement to abide by the health protocols in India. They will have to pay for the mandatory 14-day quarantine period in a hospital or institutional facility selected by the relevant state government. The passengers will undergo a Covid-19 test after a fortnight.Starting registrations at this time will help them plan out the schedule of flights between selected destinations in India more efficiently, Indian officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/repatriation-registration-story/story-BeoG8GLssMVtH5tOJ0PDqK.html

06-05-2020||World||US infection rate rising outside New York as states open up||Take the New York metropolitan area’s progress against the coronavirus out of the equation and the numbers show the rest of the US is moving in the wrong direction, with the known infection rate rising even as states move to lift their lockdowns, an Associated Press analysis found Tuesday.New confirmed infections per day in the US exceed 20,000, and deaths per day are well over 1,000, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University. And public health officials warn that the failure to flatten the curve and drive down the infection rate in places could lead to many more deaths — perhaps tens of thousands — as people are allowed to venture out and businesses reopen.“Make no mistakes: This virus is still circulating in our community, perhaps even more now than in previous weeks” said Linda Ochs, director of the Health Department in Shawnee County, Kansas.Elsewhere around the world, Britain’s official coronavirus death toll, at more than 29,000, topped that of Italy to become the highest in Europe and second-highest in the world behind the United States. The official number of dead worldwide surpassed a quarter-million, by Johns Hopkins’ count, though the true toll is believed to be much higher.The densely packed New York metropolitan area, consisting of about 20 million people across a region that encompasses the city’s northern suburbs, Long Island and northern New Jersey, has been the hardest-hit corner of the country, accounting for at least one-third of the nation’s 70,000 deaths.When the still locked-down area is included, new infections in the US appear to be declining, according to the AP analysis. It found that the five-day rolling average for new cases has decreased from 9.3 per 100,000 people three weeks ago on April 13 to 8.6 on Monday.But subtracting the New York area from the analysis changes the story. Without it, the rate of new cases in the US increased over the same period from 6.2 per 100,000 people to 7.5.While the daily number of new deaths in the New York area has declined markedly in recent weeks, it has essentially plateaued in the rest of the US Without greater New York, the rolling five-day average for new deaths per 500,000 people dropped slightly from 1.86 on April 20th to 1.82 on Monday.US testing for the virus has been expanded, and that has probably contributed to the increasing rate of confirmed infections. But it doesn’t explain the entire increase, said Dr. Zuo-Feng Zhang, a public health researcher at the University of California at Los Angeles.“This increase is not because of testing. It’s a real increase,” he said.Pockets of America far from New York City are seeing ominous trends.Deaths in Iowa surged to a new daily high of 19 on Tuesday, and 730 workers at a single Tyson Foods pork plant tested positive. On Monday, Shawnee County, home to Topeka, Kansas, reported a doubling of cases from last week on the same day that business restrictions began to ease.Gallup, New Mexico, is under a strict lockdown until Thursday because of an outbreak, with guarded roadblocks to prevent travel in and out and a ban on more than two people in a vehicle. Authorities have deployed water tankers, hospital space is running short, and a high school gym is now a recuperation center with 60 oxygen-supplied beds.On Monday, a model from the University of Washington nearly doubled its projection of COVID-19 deaths in the US to around 134,000 through early August, with a range of 95,000 to nearly 243,000.Dr. Christopher Murray, director of the institute that created the projections, said the increase is largely because most states are expected to ease restrictions by next week.Without stay-at-home orders and similar measures, Murray said, “we would have had exponential growth, much larger epidemics and deaths in staggering numbers.” But cooperation is waning, with cellphone location data showing people are getting out more, even before their states reopen, he said.President Donald Trump, asked about the projections before traveling to Arizona to visit a mask factory, disputed the accuracy of models in general and said keeping the economy closed carries deadly costs of its own, such as drug abuse and suicide.“We have to get our country open,” Trump said.A senior US government scientist alleged in a whistleblower complaint Tuesday that the administration failed to prepare for the onslaught of the coronavirus. Dr. Rick Bright also said he was reassigned to a lesser role because he resisted political pressure to allow widespread use of hydroxychloroquine, a malaria drug unproven for treating COVID-19, that was being pushed by Trump.The Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement that he was transferred to the National Institutes of Health to work on coronavirus testing, a crucial assignment.Zhang, the UCLA researcher, said it’s worrying that the rate of new cases is increasing at the same time some states are easing up: “We’re one country. If we’re not moving in the same step, we’re going to have a problem.”He said he is particularly concerned about Florida and Texas, where cases have been rising steadily and the potential for explosions seems high.While death rates in some places have been trending down, that could change and hospitals could become overwhelmed, he said.Dr. Deborah Birx, coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, said she and colleagues keep warning governors against “skipping phases” in federal guidelines recommending that business and other institutions, like schools, be reopened in phases.“We don’t want to see serious illness and mortality increase,” Birx said.In Europe, meanwhile, Britain said about 29,400 people with COVID-19 have died in its hospitals, nursing homes and other settings, while Italy reported just over 29,300 confirmed fatalities.Both counts are probably underestimates because they do not include suspected cases. Britain reported more than 32,000 deaths in which COVID-19 was either confirmed or suspected; a comparable figure for Italy was not available.Even so, the rate of deaths and hospitalizations in Britain was on the decline, and the government prepared to begin loosening its lockdown.A trial began of a mobile phone app that U.K. authorities hope will help contain the outbreak by warning people if they have been near an infected individual; it could be rolled out later this month.Many European countries that have relaxed strict lockdowns after new infections tapered off were watching their virus numbers warily.“We know with great certainty that there will be a second wave — the majority of scientists are sure of that. And many also assume that there will be a third wave,” said Lothar Wieler, head of Germany’s national disease control center.South Korea reported two new cases Wednesday, its lowest daily total since February, and the country’s baseball season began the previous day with no spectators allowed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-infection-rate-rising-outside-new-york-as-states-open-up/story-ccN3D3niEkZ4hRRvhU9aHI.html
06-05-2020||World||Brazil’s Bolsonaro accused of meddling in Rio federal police||President Jair Bolsonaro was in a stir again Tuesday after Brazil’s former justice minister reportedly accused him of trying to personally pick the head of federal police operations in Rio de Janeiro, where the far-right leader has a home and two of his sons are politicians.TV Globo and mainstream Brazilian newspapers reported that former Justice Minister Sérgio Moro told investigators that Bolsonaro pressured him in March to accept a political appointee to head the country’s federal police office in Rio.The president’s sons, Sen. Flávio Bolsonaro and city council member Carlos Bolsonaro, are under investigation by Rio state prosecutors and police. The president said Tuesday that neither he nor those two sons are subjects of federal police investigations.Moro, who shot to fame as the judge who oversaw the mammoth Car Wash corruption investigation that convicted dozens of politicians and business executives, is seen as a hero by many Brazilians and was publicly granted free rein to operate in the Bolsonaro administration.He resigned April 24 after Bolsonaro fired the head of the federal police without consulting him.On Tuesday, the president confirmed that the head of federal police operations in Rio was leaving that post, but said the officer was being promoted.“I have nothing against the superintendent of Rio de Janeiro, and I don’t interfere in the federal police, and he’s being invited to be an executive director,” Bolsonaro told reporters in the capital, Brasilia.The embattled Brazilian leader also accused Moro of violating national security law by allegedly giving journalists the content of their conversations.According to the leaked summary of Moro’s deposition in the southern city of Curitiba, the former minister said Bolsonaro sent him “more or less” the following message in a text message: “You have 27 superintendencies (of the federal police). I just want one, the one in Rio de Janeiro.” The reports did not show printed images of that exchange.Bolsonaro’s prosecutor-general requested an investigation into the allegations of presidential interference that Moro made when he resigned, which a Supreme Court justice granted.

Yes,” he admitted earlier at the factory. “But we have to get our country open.”Trump’s November reelection campaign is reeling from the massive shutdown ordered to try and stop the spread of the virus, which has already killed 70,000 Americans and is forecast to take tens of thousands more lives.Praising the Honeywell workers, who churn out masks used by medical staff and other first responders, Trump reiterated that it’s time to look ahead.“I want to be a cheerleader,” he said.Bolstering that shift of direction, the White House said that Trump’s emergency coordination group for the pandemic would be disbanding, probably by early June.Unpresidential masks?Trump’s audience at Honeywell sat masked in compliance with US government recommendations and their own company rule, which was clearly displayed on a sign in the facility reading: “Please wear your mask at all times.”Trump had teased as he left Washington that after months of resistance he might finally cover his face.The fact that he skipped the opportunity to make a statement about safety was in line with his new focus on getting Americans to return to work.And he has been skeptical about masks since early on.White House medical experts and even First Lady Melania Trump promote masks as a crucial tool in fighting the viral spread.But the president, tuned closely into his loyal right-wing base, has used his massive visibility to downplay the need.“I think wearing a face mask as I greet presidents, prime ministers, dictators, kings, queens, I don’t know,” he said in April, apparently suggesting a mask would be unpresidential. “Somehow, I don’t see it for myself.”Alterative factsTrump’s Arizona mask moment came after his vice president, Mike Pence, caused an uproar a week ago when he was photographed mask-less during a visit to the famous Mayo Clinic hospital in Rochester, Minnesota, which requires visitors to cover up.Pence -- unusually for a member of the Trump administration -- publicly admitted he’d been wrong.“I didn’t think it was necessary, but I should have worn a mask,” he said on Sunday.On a subsequent trip, Pence did wear a mask.The White House says that because top officials and their guests are frequently tested for the coronavirus they generally don’t need to follow the guidance.However, the controversy runs deeper, reflecting a dispute over facts that has turned swaths of the United States into camps where the left and right see different basic realities.Polls show that Democrats support face covering as a sign of shared responsibility, while some Republicans see mask-wearing orders as a big government threat to individual liberty.Trump-supported groups protesting the coronavirus lockdown -- sometimes ostentatiously brandishing firearms and parading in paramilitary garb -- liken going mask-free to an act of political independence.In Stillwater, Oklahoma, and other cities, local leaders abandoned orders to wear masks after threats of violence.A common slogan at the protests now is that the entire pandemic is a “hoax.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/it-s-possible-there-ll-be-some-trump-admits-us-reopening-will-cost-more-lives/story-gIGLKqdqTzdC7FQoBxo6vO.html

The Trump administration also is being sued by citizens denied virus aid because they are married to undocumented immigrants.The $2 trillion Cares Act, approved by Congress in March, provides $1,200 payments to US taxpayers who earn as much as $75,000 -- plus $500 for each child. But to be eligible, both spouses in families that file joint tax returns must have Social Security numbers, which are unavailable to the childrens’ parents, according to the complaint filed Tuesday in federal court in Greenbelt, Maryland, against the US government and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.“The refusal to distribute this benefit to US citizen children undermines the Cares Act’s goal of providing assistance to Americans in need, frustrates the act’s efforts to jumpstart the economy, and punishes citizen children for their parents’ status -- punishment that is particularly nonsensical given that undocumented immigrants, collectively, pay billions of dollars each year in taxes,” according to the complaint.The children, who are identified only by their initials, are seeking to represent a class of millions of other kids who are US citizens and have parents who are unable to get the $500 payments because one or both of them is undocumented.The White House and Treasury didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.The case is R.V. v. Mnuchin, 20-cv-01148, US District Court, District of Maryland (Greenbelt)..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-administration-sued-by-migrants-kids-for-denied-virus-aid/story-IEuj71z4eODcY0X0ZF7QnK.html
06-05-2020||World||Trump admin officials ignored Covid-19 warnings, alleges fired American scientist||Top health officials of the Trump administration repeatedly warned the multiple warnings with regard to the coronavirus pandemic, including the alleged poor quality of malaria drug hydroxychloroquine from India and Pakistan, a fired American scientist has said in a whistleblower complaint.In a complaint filed on Tuesday before the US Office of Special Counsel, which oversees protection of whistleblowers, Rick Bright alleged that top officials of the Department of Health and Human Services repeatedly ignored his messages and that of others with regard to personal protective equipment and medicines like hydroxychloroquine in particular.When fired, Bright was head of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, a research agency within the Health and Human Services (HHS) Department. He reported directly to Robert Kadlec, the assistant secretary of preparedness and response at the US Department of Health and Human Services.“Dr Bright remained extremely concerned about the drug’s importation from Pakistan and India because the FDA had not inspected the drugs or the factory that produced them,” the complaint said.“In Dr Bright’s experience, drugs from uninspected factories can be contaminated or dosed improperly, and this could obviously be dangerous to those who took the medication. Apparently unconcerned about this known danger, Dr Kadlec and others in the administration sought to ‘flood’ the marketplace with these drugs,” it alleged.The Trump administration has imported nearly five crore units of the malaria drug, hydroxychloroquine, which in March had received Emergency Use Authorisation from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).The Trump administration, the complaint said, was not interested in hearing from Bright and his department or subject matter experts.“Dr Bright and his team had apparently spent all their political capital in their effort to limit chloroquine and rushing into a potentially dangerous situation and that there was no one to help stop the push to ‘flood’ the country with this unproven and potentially dangerous drug,” the complaint said.“He concluded that his only remaining avenue was to share his concerns with the journalist who understood the specific issue and risks associated with these drugs and who had already gathered substantial information from multiple sources,” it added.The complaint alleged that HHS Secretary Alex Azar’s directive to secure a Nationwide Expanded Access IND protocol for chloroquine, based on scant scientific evidence and on such a short time-frame, sent Bright and his colleagues scrambling.Within the hour, Bright had called a meeting of Dr Linda Lambert, Chief Medical Officer Dr Robert Walker, Director of Regulatory and Quality Affairs Dr Tremel Faison, and Drs Johnson, Disbrow and Houchens to discuss the directive.The group expressed serious concerns about a Nationwide Expanded Access IND protocol for chloroquine given the lack of clinical data available about its therapeutic benefits and concerns about its potential safety risks, especially if administered without close physician supervision, it said.Bright and his FDA colleagues were also concerned about the quality and potential toxicity of the chloroquine supplies produced and shipped in from facilities in India and Pakistan that were not approved by the FDA and therefore, not approved to be used in the US marketplace.The HHS clinical and regulatory expert teams worked frantically for 48 hours without sleep to come up with a plan that would ensure the greatest level of safety for people who received this drug.They discussed narrower options for the rollout, including a small pilot study, and established an inter-agency working group of clinical and regulatory experts to determine the safest way to make the unproven drug available without causing harm to the American public, the complaint said.When fired earlier, Bright alleged that he was ousted because of his “insistence” that the government spend funds on “safe and scientifically-vetted solutions” to address the coronavirus crisis and not on “drugs, vaccines and other technologies that lack scientific merit”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-admin-officials-ignored-covid-19-warnings-alleges-fired-american-scientist/story-QEWWk2n3jRvFrWxUlChKWL.html

The lab theory has been pushed by the Trump administration, which has been critical of China’s handling of the outbreak.WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan said, “We have not received specific evidence from the US government relating to the purported origin of the virus. So from our perspective, this remains speculative.”Titled “Evil Pompeo is wantonly spewing poison and spreading lies”, a commentary by Chinese broadcaster CCTV cited the WHO’s Ryan and Columbia University virologist Ian Lipkin, who claimed that the virus is natural in origin. “These flawed and unreasonable remarks by American politicians make it clear to more and more people that no ‘evidence’ exists,” it said. “The so-called ‘virus leaked from a Wuhan lab’ hype is a complete and utter lie.”Commentaries in People’s Daily called Pompeo and ex-White House strategist Steve Bannon “lying clowns”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-spat-intensifies-as-china-calls-mike-pompeo-insane-for-lab-claim/story-O3kQi1KGnqMd9MM23ahifI.html

As a result, several states have announced plans to open up their economy in a phased manner.In its report, Johns Hopkins University projected new coronavirus cases in the US reaching 200,000 daily by June 1 and fatalities around 3,000. “Those projections are with no mitigation. We are doing mitigation,” Trump told reporters before boarding Air Force One at Joint Base Andrews on his way to Arizona.In a statement, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said that the Johns Hopkins’ study being pushed around by the media as factual is based on faulty assumptions and is in no way representative of any federal government projections.John Hopkins University in a separate statement said that the research conducted by it for Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) was to assist in planning for various scenarios and was not to be used for the official forecast.The New York Times was the first newspaper to report about it on Monday.“As Johns Hopkins stated, should not be taken as a forecast,” McEnany said.“This study considered zero mitigation, meaning it was conducted as though no federal guidelines were in place, no contract tracing, no expansion of testing, while removing all shelter in place protocols laid out in the phased approach of the Opening Up America Again guidelines for individuals with co-morbidities,” she said.“The media should be more responsible in its reporting and give the full set of information to the American public,” McEnany said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-white-house-dismiss-report-claiming-us-covid-19-toll-could-reach-3-000-in-june/story-ONvSHzo2osVfaqYIjGDNpJ.html
06-05-2020||India||Transgender activists write to Centre demanding support during Covid-19 crisis||Transgender people have appealed to the government to institute a monthly basic income, ensure access to ration and essentials and supply of medication to help the marginalised community during the Covid-19 pandemic. In a letter to the finance, home and social justice ministries, more than 2,000 activists and groups said the community was hit hard by the ongoing national lockdown because it obliterated their primary sources of income -- begging and sex work – and the lack of proper identity cards stopped their access to social security schemes.“This community is already very badly affected and further marginsalised during a pandemic, and prone to higher health risks. It is important that the central government provide adequate support, which must include ration,” said Meera Sanghamitra, an activist and one of the signatories to the letter. The activists noted that some measures had been instituted to help the community – such as the provision of Rs 1,500 by the National Institute of Social Defense (NISD) -- but added that such efforts were mostly localized and inadequate. For example, the NISD allowance reached around 4,500 people, according to the activists, which made up roughly 1% of the 488,000-odd transpeople counted in the 2011 Census. The activists demanded that the government provide a subsistence income of at least Rs. 3,000 per month, universalize the public distribution system to ensure food security, block the eviction or forced rent payment of transpeople, and ensure uninterrupted supply of essential medication. “This would also be in keeping with the spirit of the judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in NALSA vs UoI (14th April, 2014) and obligations of the state, there under as well as under Article 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution of India,” the letter added, referring to the 2014 verdict of the top court that affirmed the rights of the trans community and recognised them as “third gender”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/transgender-activists-write-to-centre-demanding-support-during-covid-19-crisis/story-v8vV8kEquqfFjXX3YEvODM.html
06-05-2020||India||Now, Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka join states in raising taxes on liquor to fight Covid-19||The Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka governments decided to increase taxes on liquor and fuel on Wednesday to mop up resources to fight coronavirus, a few days after Delhi, Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal increased taxes on liquor.In the past three days, states such as Delhi, Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal had increased taxes on liquor to fund the fight against Covid-19.Several states including West Bengal, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttarakhand on Wednesday reported up to 20% higher excise revenue than normal days and said the rush reported on Monday was slowly tapering. As a result, lesser people were seen at liquor shops in these states. However, women in Uttarkashi district of Uttarakhand, Bolangir in Odisha and in some parts of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh protested over the reopening of liquor shops saying it would derail their families. In West Bengal’s North 24 Parganas district, some women wielding sticks thrashed people who queued outside liquor vends.The Uttar Pradesh cabinet on Wednesday approved proposals making petrol, diesel and liquor costlier to earn an additional Rs 4,429 crore in 2020-2021, said state’s finance minister Suresh Khanna. He said petrol prices will increase by Rs 2 per litre from the present Rs 71.91 and diesel Re 1 per litre from Rs 62.86. The prices will increase from Wednesday night.The cabinet decided to make liquor costlier by Rs 5 per bottle in case of country made liquor to Rs 400 per bottle (of more than 500 ml) in the case of imported brands of foreign liquor. For brands of regular and premium categories, an additional Rs 20 will be charged on 180 ml bottle, Rs 30 on 180 ml to 500 ml bottle and Rs 50 on more than 500 ml bottle, he said. For imported liquor Rs 100 extra will be charged on 180 ml bottle while Rs 200 additional amount will be charged on 180 ml to 500 ml bottle. An additional Rs 400 will be charged on more than 500 ml of imported liquor.Since May 4, when the liquor shops opened in the state, the government has got revenue of Rs 200 crore. “We got maximum revenue on Wednesday even though there was so much hype on Monday,” an official said. In 2019-20, UP had earned revenue of Rs 23,918 crore from liquor sales (2018-19) against the target of Rs 30,000 crore. Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa also announced an increase in liquor prices by 11% and a stimulus package worth Rs 1,610 crore. As a part of the package, the government has decided to pay one time compensation of Rs 5,000 to Rs 60,000 to washer men (dhobis), Rs 2,30,000 to barbers, Rs 7.75 lakh to auto rickshaw and taxi drivers.In West Bengal, a huge rush was witnessed outside liquor stores for the second consecutive day despite the government increasing the prices by 30%.Bengal’s commissioner excise, Niranjan Das, said the sale of liquor in the last two days was about 58 crore, which is slightly higher than normal days. On an average Bengal gets Rs 25 crore from excise revenue. “On Monday, the liquor sale was about Rs 29 crore and on Tuesday it was about Rs 28 crore even though bars and liquor shops in malls are closed,” Das said, adding liquor sale contributes substantially to the state’s revenue.Similarly, revenue from liquor sale has been encouraging in Assam. In three days, the state earned Rs 75 crore as revenue from liquor sales, which was Rs 65 crore for entire March, officials said. In April, due to lockdown, the state had earned only Rs six crore from liquor sales. Rajasthan reported revenue of Rs 40 to 45 on Tuesday and Madhya Pradesh about Rs 40 crore.In Haryana, where shops opened on Wednesday, long queues were seen outside the liquor vends in several districts such as Bhiwani, Dadri, Rohtak and Sonepat districts. However, in many places the vends did not open in the absence of stock, officials said. RK Pandey, a resident of Kumaon, who waited for 30 minutes outside a liquor store, said: “The liquor shop was closed for six weeks and people are not sure whether it will remain open tomorrow or not so they are stocking liquor.”There were reports of women protesting against vends opening in some districts such as Uttarkashi and Chamoli districts. Sunita Negi, head of Virpur village said, “People have not been working here in the village and nearby villages due to the coronavirus pandemic. The situation will only worsen if liquor shops are opened as the men will spend money on liquor.”Liquor shops remained closed in Jharkhand, Kerala and Punjab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-karnataka-hike-prices-of-fuel-to-improve-state-finances-as-liquor-sales-slow-down/story-7kgxC8mcTfDhGfWNWqGUVN.html
06-05-2020||India||‘Irrfan was a gentle soul, a master actor’||Director/cinematographer Mazhar Kamran feels the multiple entertainment platforms we have today are truly a blessing for both the producers as well as the audience. “Yes, of course, it is a boon. Imagine going into lockdown without OTT platforms. Also, the kind of good content being generated now, be it in films, OTT or television, is definitely better than what it used to be,” said Kamran speaking over the phone.With a body of work like ‘Satya’, ‘Kaun’ and ‘Mast’, Sujoy Ghosh’s ‘Jhankar Beats’ and directorial debut ‘Mohandas’ along with documentaries like ‘Ainie Apa,’ Kamran is glad with the release of his short film, ‘The Photographer’, after its round of film fests around globe ended and got its OTT release this week. “I am happy that the release of the short film on the web will take it to a larger audience. Also, I have completed half of another short film ‘Nalini’, with FTII students. The film was supposed to be screened at a few international film fests but due to the Covid-19 outbreak, things have had to be put on hold. So, we are waiting to get back to work so that it can reach audiences soon,” said the Lucknowite.Remembering his initial days when he was just one-film-old and got to work with Irrfan Khan for TV, Kamran said, “I had done ‘Satya’ when Tigmanshu (Dhulia) was directing the episodic ‘Ek sham ki mulaqat’ for ‘Star Bestsellers’ (1999) and that was my first interaction with him during the shoot. After that we were constantly in touch with each other. He was a gentle soul and a master actor. The way he understood his craft was commendable. A lot was planned but he went away too soon.”Kamran was all set to bring his next directorial film this year. “As everything is on hold, so is all our work. But I am utilising all this time writing and scripting new stories for feature films I plan to work on soon. All thanks to webinars and online classes that are also keeping me busy. Teaching what you know to the younger lot of our country is actually a very gratifying experience. I must say today’s youth is far smarter than what we were in our younger days.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/irrfan-was-a-gentle-soul-a-master-actor/story-L3UVPUA20hNeNirGalB4LI.html

This was done after authorities said the kits were producing inaccurate results in the field.Livzon said in its statement said it was “shocked” by media reports that its kits were showing only 5.4% accuracy as millions of the kits had been supplied around the world after they were validated by Chinese and other authorities.Referring to ICMR’s finding that the kits had shown wide variation in their sensitivity in field conditions, Livzon said: “We feel very disappointed [by] the result from ICMR. Our product gained positive report from NIV under ICMR in April before we delivered formal shipment to India and now is still listed as their recommendation…”Livzon also questioned the conditions in which the kits were used by state governments and the tests conducted by ICMR in field conditions. “There was no convincing source pointing out the [inaccurate] results only came from products made in China,” it said, questioning whether ICMR had evaluated similar products from other countries.Wondfo’s statement said its kit was one of the first such products to get an import licence from India and contended several reports in the media in the US and UK had stated that its kits were among the products from a few companies that delivered reliable results.There was no reaction from Indian officials to the statements from the Chinese firms.The Chinese government too has expressed concern about India’s decision to stop using the kits of the two Chinese firms, saying it was “unfair and irresponsible” to label the Chinese products as “faulty”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chinese-firms-again-question-findings-about-their-kits-by-indian-authorities/story-40A8oYYmGK88Ub5NzaiKBP.html

The rise has been attributed to the increase in the number of tests – 2,570 persons were tested on Wednesday – while new cases have also been reported from hitherto unaffected areas. The number of containment zones in the state has also increased from 444 on April 30 to 555 on May 6.While Kolkata, and its neighbouring districts of Howrah and North 24-Parganas have so far been the state’s major concern – accounting for 754, 289, and 202 cases respectively – new cases were reported from 7 districts on May 4, from 9 districts on May 5 and from 8 districts on May 6.Kolkata has emerged as the biggest challenge for the state government, with the capital city accounting for more than half of the state’s Covid-19 cases. Containment zones in the city increased from 264 on April 30 to 334 of May 6, while 119 people tested positive for coronavirus infection in the last three days.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage.“Our number of tests has significantly increased and we hope to conduct 2,500 statewide tests on an average from now on,” state home secretary Alapan Bandyopadhyay said.A total of 2,570 tests were conducted on Wednesday and, on average, Bengal has conducted 2,269 cases a day over the past six days, with 13,616 tests conducted between May 1 and 6. In contrast, the state tested only 16,455 people in the 45 days between March 17 and April 30. Trinamool Congress Lok Sabha MP Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar said the figures “should not been seen like cricket scorecards”. “Given the nature of the virus, every state will have its own time of peaking and flattening of the curve,” said Ghosh Dastidar who is a doctor by qualification.Meanwhile, union home secretary Ajay Bhalla, in yet another letter to Bengal chief secretary Rajiva Sinha on Wednesday said that the state’s low testing rate and very high mortality rate reflected “poor surveillance, detection and testing.”The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), too, blamed a poorly implemented lockdown for the spread of the disease. “The lockdown was never implemented properly. People freely crowded as the police stood bystanders,” alleged BJP state unit president Dilip Ghosh, a Lok Sabha MP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-records-100-cases-of-covid-19-on-a-single-day-for-first-time/story-re97mxtKdr4CFcQ0zHh2DP.html

We have offered India 50 topics for cooperation in health and science regarding the coronavirus,” Malka said.At the same time, Israel is working to put together start-ups and entrepreneurs from both sides to work on finding solutions to different aspects of the Covid-19 crisis. The focus, Malka said, is not just on equipment to prevent infections and defeat the virus but also on facilitating new ways of doing things amid the unprecedented lockdown.“The focus is on top priority areas we want to promote to defeat the virus but also on new methods and equipment to manage the situation,” he said, referring to the development by Israel of solutions such as hand washing stations, ultra-violet light technology, 3D printing of face masks and anti-virus fabrics that block and kill viruses.He also referred to the development of a low-cost ventilator, whose design and codes are open-source, by Israeli researchers from private companies and state-run companies such as Microsoft and Israeli Aerospace Industries, and the breakthrough by the Israel Institute for Biological Research (IIBR) in isolating an antibody that neutalises SARS-CoV-2.“I think this crisis brought Israel and India even closer together, given the fact that we are seen as a precious and close friend, given that there is mutual trust and respect between Israel and India, especially in areas of science and technology,” Malka said.Malka also spoke of Israel’s use of technology for tracing those who tested positive and the people they were in contact with against the backdrop of a debate in India on privacy concerns related to the Aarogya Setu aap.“This is a very careful line that we are now playing because we need to balance between…the need not to violate privacy [since] Israel is a democracy respecting the rights of everyone and universal freedom [and] on the other hand, we have this tech that can help us get control and help save people’s lives,” he said.The technology is being used for a “limited extent and time” by the executive while the legislative branch works on laws and procedures under the supervision of the judiciary, he said. “The basic thing is trust and understanding. In other times, no one will even dare to offer this kind of tracing,” he added.Israel is also keen to share data on Covid-19 with India as having more data to analyse will help uncover patterns and characteristics of the disease, he said.Malka, a trained economist, said any exit strategy for a lockdown will be all “about balancing life and livelihood”. He said, “We understand health is very important but the economy is also important for the health of the people.” Asked about the call from several countries for an investigation into the origin of Covid-19, Malka said: “The focus now is on trying to defeat the virus, taking the right measures to fully control the infection curve and develop a vaccine or a medicine as fast as we can while we find a balance between the needs for health and the economy.“The investigation – where did it come from and why – this is something that we can leave for later. I don’t think Israel is involved with that and I know we have harnessed all our efforts, our experts and our technology just to defeat this virus.”Israel, which was one of the first countries to go into a total lockdown, has so far recorded more than 16,000 Covid-19 cases and 238 deaths. More than 10,500 people have recovered and only 70 are still in intensive care, the envoy said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-israel-suggests-50-topics-in-health-for-cooperation-with-india/story-9hqfu60ZbzLjO6n7NVMFaP.html

While the opposition has called the app a ‘surveillance system’, the government maintains that data of citizens remains safe. MyGov.in CEO Abhishek Singh spoke exclusively to Hindustan Times senior editor Aditi Prasad on the privacy concerns and objectives of the app. Watch here.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/news-updates-from-hindustan-times-tmc-roasts-centre-over-late-covid-19-response-and-all-the-latest-news/story-yteG1cBWPcypZP636dkC8N.html
06-05-2020||India||TMC roasts Centre over ‘late’ Covid-19 response||West Bengal’s ruling party Trinamool Congress (TMC) on Wednesday demanded the Rs 20,000 crore Central Vista project in New Delhi be scrapped, alleged that Arogya Setu app was being used for surveillance on people and accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government at the Centre of acting late on the Covid-19 crisis.The party even alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah were supervising and controlling “a concerted effort to malign and heckle the Bengal government.”Their allegations came amid an unrelenting attack by the BJP on the Mamata Banerjee government over allegations of Covid-19 data fudging, alleged scam in the public distribution system and mismanagement in dealing with the pandemic. “We demand the Rs 20,000 crore Parliament renovation project be scrapped and the money used for the poor, especially the migrant workers. Of what use would this project be, except for, perhaps, creating an underground way for the Prime Minister to travel from this residence to the Parliament?” said TMC Rajya Sabha leader and national spokesperson Derek O’Brien at an interaction with journalists through video conferencing. .The party’s Lok Sabha MPs Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar and Sudip Banerjee also took part in the interaction.Taking a dig at the use of Arogya Setu app, Ghosh Dastidar said, “Instead of the declared purpose of contact tracing, this app is being used for surveillance on people.”“It is because the Centre was not prepared that the states initially received insufficient testing kits and PPEs. That’s how the containment was affected,” she said. Sudip Banerjee, the TMC’s leader in the Lok Sabha alleged that central government officials, including those in the inter-ministerial central teams, were “writing like politicians” because they were “merely signing documents drafted by their political masters.”“There is a concerted effort on behalf of the Centre and BJP to malign and heckle the state and disturb the state’s operations against the pandemic,” Banerjee alleged. His remarks came in the backdrop of the Centre pulling up the state over the number of issues related to Covid-19 management in the state. These include at least three letters from the Union home ministry and three from the inter-ministerial central teams.Separately, TMC secretary-general and state education minister Partha Chatterjee alleged that when the world was planning for Covid-19 in February and March, Centre was busy honouring US president Donald Trump in Gujarat and in “horse-trading” in Madhya Pradesh.“Our party has been raising the issue right from the beginning, sought closure of Parliament sessions at the beginning of March and our chief minister kept demanding that the railways and international flights be stopped. They did not heed and let the virus spread. And when they finally acted, they did not allow lakhs of migrant workers the slightest time to return home. This is nothing but miserable planning,” Chatterjee alleged.BJP rubbished all charges and said that the state was being led to peril by the Mamata Banerjee government. “Had Centre not intervened, we the people of the state would have been in a complete mess. If anything changed for the better, it was due to the pressure created by the Centre,” BJP state unit president Dilip Ghosh said.Responding to TMC’s charge that BJP was indulging in politics in times of a pandemic, Ghosh said, “We are the opposition party. Our role is to highlight where the government is going wrong. We will keep doing it.” On Tuesday, BJP carried out a silent protest at the compound of all block development offices (BDOs) protesting a scam in ration distribution. Protesters wore masks and stood maintaining distance from each other and carried posters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tmc-tops-guns-roast-centre-over-late-covid-19-response/story-5pFUzEpTGfFkWLmCC2Yu7J.html
06-05-2020||India||Covid-19 update: As expatriates return, Kerala vows to prevent past slip-ups||Kerala readies to welcome the first batch of expatriates from the Middle East, hoping to maintain a clean coronavirus slate after not reporting a single positive case on Wednesday.Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said eight out of the state’s 14 districts are now Covid-free with only 30 active patients remaining under treatment at hospitals after the successful recovery of 468 Covid-19 patients. Kerala has seen only four deaths among the 502 positive cases registered in the state since the outbreak.The CM said the state will have to maintain its present tempo in disease containment even as it welcomes back stranded residents from abroad beginning Thursday, when two flights—one from Abu Dhabi and another from Dubai will land at Kochi and Kozhikkode airports respectively. He said the government has made all the necessary arrangements for their arrival.“It is another challenge for us. We have to maintain strict vigilance. There is no room for any complacency at this juncture. We will move all returnees to the government quarantine centres on their arrival and will look after them well,” the CM said.The chief minister’s word of caution is not unfounded since Kerala, which seems to have things under control at the moment, was dealt a setback a couple of months ago when some of the returnees from the gulf countries jumped home quarantine and turned into super-spreaders of the disease. This time the state is taking no chances.“For the first seven days, they will be kept in government quarantine, after this, RT-PCR tests will be done on them. If found negative; they will be sent home, where they will remain in isolation for another week. There is no confusion over this,” said the CM.The government has set up ‘Covid Homes’ or quarantine facilities near all four international airports in the state, including vacant flats, houses and houseboats.Four lakh people have enlisted on the state government’s website requesting repatriation and Kerala expects at least two lakh residents’ return in one month.Vijayan replied to Union minister of state for external affairs V Muaraleedharan’s allegation that the Kerala CM was spreading “canards” by saying it was not ideal for people holding official positions to not maintain the decorum.On Tuesday, Muraleedharan had rubbished Vijayan’s claim that the Centre was flying back expatriates from the Middle East without conducting any tests as “totally absurd”.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19Apart from the return of expatriates, the government also needs to deal deftly with the mass movement of migrant workers to prevent a new chain of positive cases. At least eight trains carrying stranded migrant workers have left the state and more are expected in coming days.Kerala was the first state to report coronavirus case in the country, when a China-returned medical student was diagnosed positive in January.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-update-as-expatriates-return-kerala-vows-to-prevent-past-slip-ups/story-ibz9EHSkQUdOxS5TzbGIUP.html
06-05-2020||India||No privacy breach in Aarogya Setu app: IT min Ravi Shankar Prasad||The coronavirus tracking app Aarogya Setu was “secure” and there was no privacy breach in it, Union IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said on Wednesday, rejecting charges that it was a “sophisticated surveillance system” that was leveraged to track citizens without their consent.The government’s assertion also came a day after French hacker and cyber security expert Elliot Alderson had claimed that “a security issue has been found” in the app and that “privacy of 90 million Indians is at stake”.     Describing the app as a “prominent preventive measure” in India’s fight against the Covid-19 pandemic, an official release said as per information available, close to nine crore users have downloaded it as on May 4. The mobile application is used by the government for contact tracing and disseminating medical advisories to users in order to contain the spread of Covid-19.         “This is a technological invention of India -- Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, our scientists, NIC, Niti Aayog and some private (entities) -- whereby it is a perfectly accountable platform to help in the fight against Covid-19. It is safe and secure. The data is in an encrypted form. Most importantly, it is for the safety of Indians in public interest because it cautions you in the event there is a Covid-infected person in your vicinity.” Prasad told PTI.      Last week, the Centre made it mandatory for government and private sector employees to use Aarogya Setu mobile application to bolster the efforts to fight the Covid-19 pandemic, and instructed the organisational heads to ensure 100 percent coverage. The Union Home Ministry also said the mobile app will be a must for people living in Covid-19 containment zones.          Following the government’s announcement, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi alleged that the app is a “sophisticated surveillance system, outsourced to a private operator, with no institutional oversight”, raising serious data security and privacy concerns.             “Technology can help keep us safe; but fear must not be leveraged to track citizens without their consent,” Gandhi had said.Using the GPS (global positioning system), the app helps in tracking movement of Covid-19 patients within coronavirus hotspots. However, the opposition party and others have maintained that the application captures more information than necessary for the tracking purposes.           Prasad said the mobile application also helps tracing contacts in the event a person is infected. “It is a very robust invention of technology and many other countries are using similar applications to fight Covid-19. And the second most important point is that the data is limited. Routine data remains for 30 days and in the event you are infected, then (for) 45 to 60 days. Then automatically it will vanish,” he explained.         There is always an option to scratch the app out of the phone or uninstall it, he added. “Then what is this ‘hangama’ (rukus) all about? The country has understood its utility and has willingly accepted it,” he said.       The Aarogya Setu app is for smart phones.“For feature phones we have developed Aarogya Setu IVRS. The app is absolutely robust in terms of privacy protection and safety and security of data,” he said.         According to the Union home ministry, it is mandatory for all government and private sector employees attending office to download the app.         Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been urging people to download the Aarogya Setu app, saying it is a fantastic use of technology to combat coronavirus.“Tracks the spread of Covid-19 and notifies you if someone around you is suffering from it. Also lists help-desk numbers of various states,” he had said in a series of tweets last month.         Dismissing Alderson’s claim, the government said “no personal information of any user has been proven to be at risk by this ethical hacker”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-privacy-breach-in-aarogya-setu-app-it-min-ravi-shankar-prasad/story-AQ8m1YqSyLFMx4kABQ4gAK.html

They were asked to submit their report at the earliest.Two bodies were put in the hospital’s mortuary on May 3. One was of Rajmohan (70) of Uttrakhand and other was of Pappu Ram Prajapat (55) of Alwar city. Hospital authorities did not hand over the bodies to the relatives because they were waiting for results of the samples that they had given for Covid-19 tests. When both samples tested negative, the hospital asked the relatives to come on May 6. Click here for full Covid-19 coverage.Rajmohan was admitted due to old age related disease. He worked as a chowkidar in a private house in Alwar. His son Sanjay came from Dehradun on Wednesday morning and went to hospital with his father’s employer to take his body for cremation.After the house owner and Rajmohan’s son identified the body, police handed it over to them. After the cremation, Sanjay returned to Dehradun. Trouble started a few hours later when Pappu Ram Prajapat’s family and relatives reached the hospital in the afternoon to take the body. His sons Deepak and Sonu and other relatives pointed out that the body was of a different person and refused to take it.It then became clear that there had been a mistake while releasing the first body in the morning. Rajmohan’s employer was called to the hospital and she realised that there had been a mistake. “When Sanjay was contacted he said that he hadn’t seen his father for the last 20 years and relied on his father’s employer to recognise him,” a hospital official said.Deepak Prajapat and Sony Prajapat insisted that they will not take the body which is not of their father’s at any cost and have asked the police to file an FIR against the hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/alwar-hospital-under-fire-after-man-claims-wrong-body-cremates-it/story-HeGb0ABWWsAUHcgjBZkzJN.html
06-05-2020||India||Lab-grown antibodies could block Sars-Cov-2 virus: Scientists||Lab-grown antibodies have been shown evidence of blocking the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in the Netherlands and Israel, and could emerge as a critical new tool to stop the spread of the infection.Scientists in the Netherlands and Israel have separately created antibodies in the lab that can neutralise Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, to prevent human cells from getting infected.Monoclonal antibodies are man-made proteins that act like natural antibodies and that work by identifying and binding to the virus to destroy it.The antibodies stopped infection in human cells in the lab, reported Dutch scientists in the journal, Nature Communications, on the same day as Israel’s defence minister announced a government-run research centre had developed antibodies to “neutralise” coronavirus in pre-clinical trials.“Monoclonal antibodies are an established cancer therapy that works against specific types of cancers, such as cancers of the breast and blood. Herceptin, for example, is a monoclonal antibody that has been successfully used as targeted therapy for the treatment of breast cancers for at least two decades. It acts by blocking the HER2-neu receptor to prevent the spread of the cancer,” said SVS Deo, head of surgical oncology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences. Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is a protein that promotes the growth of cancer cells.In the absence of a vaccine and an effective targeted therapy for Covid-19, monoclonal therapeutics offers a new therapy modality. Dutch researchers have identified a monoclonal antibody against Sars-CoV-2.“Here we report a human monoclonal antibody that neutralizes Sars-CoV-2 (and Sars-CoV) in cell culture. This cross-neutralising antibody targets a communal epitope on these viruses and may offer potential for prevention and treatment of Covid-19,” said researchers from the Netherlands in Nature Communications. An epitope is a part of the virus that is recognised and targeted by the immune system, specifically by antibodies, B cells, or T cells.“The monoclonal antibody treatment against Sars-CoV2 is promising but needs extensive and robust human trials to establish whether it stops Covid-19 infection and helps patients recover,” said Deo.Israel has said trials and regulatory approvals will be tracked to have a therapy ready in several months based on the monoclonal antibodies developed by the state-run Israel Institute for Biological Research in Ness Ziona in central Israel.There is no cure for Covid-19 and the treatment largely depends on repurposed drugs, such as anti-malarial drugs such as hydroxychloroquine and chloroquinine, and antivirals such as remdesivir and favipiravir. At least 120 vaccines are in various stages of development, with researchers using diverse platforms in the race to develop a vaccine that prevents infection and/or severe disease within a year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lab-grown-antibodies-could-block-sars-cov-2-virus-scientists/story-vx24ZoDsFw6QKQCQn1zJbI.html

They say the coronavirus outbreak has already taken a toll on household incomes due to joblessness and the reopening of liquor stores was likely to add to the financial woes of family units. The women from Virpur and Dunda villages in Uttarkashi district have been protesting outside the liquor shops.Sunita Negi, head of Virpur village said, “People have not been working in the village and in nearby villages due to the coronavirus pandemic. The situation will only worsen if liquor shops are opened as the men will spend money on liquor.”Negi said that the women of the village “would not allow the shops to open, and carry out a movement if needed.”Pushpa Bhatt, the village head of Dunda village said the liquor shops will not be allowed to reopen anywhere between the Kachdu Devta Mandir to Renuka Devi temple. The protesting women alleged that the habit of liquor consumption was spoiling the culture and the environment in the villages as the youngsters were taking up alcohol.“Families keep on complaining about day to day conflicts that arise due to lack of income. We will not allow liquor shops to open in our area,” said Bhatt.Uttarkashi district excise officer Harish Chandra said the officials will try talking to the women of the villages and find a solution.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19Long queues of people violating social distancing norms have been witnessed outside liquor shops across the state after the relaxations came into effect and the authorities have struggled to manage people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/women-in-uttarakhand-villages-are-not-saying-cheers-to-reopening-of-liquor-shops/story-utPMm7MTXGw5tC4OVDsBAO.html

It further highlighted instances of lockdown violations reported from the cities.“The response to Covid-19 in West Bengal has been characterised by a very low rate of testing in proportion to the population and a very high rate of mortality of 13.2% for the state, by far the highest for nay state, this is a reflection of poor surveillance, detection and testing in the state,” said the letter.It exhorted the state to increase random testing in crowded clusters.“Instances of overcrowding in bazaars, with poor sanitation; free movement of people in large numbers without masks; bathing of people in rives; people playing cricket and football; serious laxity in enforcing lockdown measures in containment zones, plying of rickshaws etc without any restriction; are grave violation of lockdown instructions and social distancing norms,” noted the letter. The MHA also drew state’s attention to the poor community awareness, especially among labourers as a cause of concern. It urged the state to bridge gaps in surveillance and contact tracing of positive case.“Indefinite delays in testing results has further affected the contact tracing process and has put patients under high risk. A string surveillance and testing regime coupled with confidence building measures and effective use of Aarogya Setu app could help in curtailing the spread of the virus,” the ministry noted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/people-playing-cricket-bathing-in-rivers-mha-on-lockdown-violations-in-bengal/story-p78Vx2M4d90GKkCzwcUrFK.html

The move by the government is meant to boost availability of hand sanitisers in the domestic market amid the outbreak of the infectious Covid-19 disease.Sanitisers are an essential component in the fight against the deadly infection and are used as a disinfectant to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.Hand sanitisers were one of the first products to be sold out at retail outlets across the country as the coronavirus infection started spreading in March. Sanitisers of reputed companies are not available in the market till date due to the extended lockdown and several gaps in the supply chain.Multiple reports of people drinking sanitisers due to the high alcohol content have also emerged across India. Last month, a 29-year-old research student died in Hoysala Nagar of Dharwad district in Karnataka after consuming a mixture of sanitiser and cough syrup as he was unable to get liquor.Police personnel and health officials have repeatedly appealed to people not to consume sanitisers or syrups. But unable to get access to liquor during the nationwide lockdown, a number of people had taken to consuming all kinds of substances, which included hand sanitisers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-bans-exports-of-alcohol-based-hand-sanitizers/story-L8iQjwj5hB3YCxlfPu1D3K.html

Those with a new loss of smell should be advised to self-isolate and be tested. This simple manoeuvre could save lives,” tweeted Dr Richard Horton, editor in chief of The Lancet journal.Ajay Swaroop, chairman of the department of ENT (ear, nose and throat) in New Delhi’s Sir Gangaram Hospital, said: “Amnosia, or the loss of smell and with it the altering of the sense of taste, is a well established symptom of Covid-19 just as dry cough, fever and difficulty in breathing. There are very few conditions that lead to sudden loss of smell; so it should be treated as a early sign, especially by people who risk exposure at the front lines and those who develop it with another Covid-19 symptoms.”Health workers are at high risk of infection, both from undiagnosed cases as well as from patients in isolation wards due to aerosol-generating procedures such as intubation of severely ill patients in intensive care units.Last month, researchers from the University of California (UC), San Diego, found Covid-19 patients with symptoms of loss of smell and taste had a 10-fold higher risk of being hospitalised compared to those without the symptoms.“Based on our study, if you have smell and taste loss, you are more than 10 times more likely to have Covid-19 infection than other causes of infection. The most common first sign of a Covid-19 infection remains fever, but fatigue and loss of smell and taste follow as other very common initial symptoms,” said Dr Carol Yan, an otolaryngologist and head and neck surgeon at UC San Diego Health. The findings were published in the journal International Forum of Allergy & Rhinology on April 12.The San Diago study found among those who reported loss of smell and taste, the loss was typically profound, not mild. The effect was, however, temporary, and both smell and taste were restored within two to four weeks of infection.“Among the Covid-19 patients with smell loss, more than 70% had reported improvement of smell at the time of survey, and of those who hadn’t reported improvement, many had only been diagnosed recently,” said Yan.Covid-19 symptoms include fever, dry cough, tiredness, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a sudden loss of taste or smell, along with either a cough or shortness of breath, should be taken as a sign of Covid-19.Symptoms of Covid-19Cough; shortness of breath or difficulty in breathingOr at least two of these symptoms:Fever; chills; repeated shaking with chills; muscle pain; headache; sore throat; new loss of taste or smellSource: US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/calls-grow-for-testing-self-quarantine-of-health-staff-after-loss-of-smell-taste/story-HrvRXrjcgga1FdRrR1cw3O.html
06-05-2020||India||Two Covid-19 patients given plasma therapy in Jaipur, condition stable||Two Covid-19 patients have been given convalescent plasma therapy at the SMS hospital in Jaipur and doctors say their condition is stable. The plasma donors were recovered Covid-19 patients.Dr Sudhir Bhandari, the principal, SMS Medical College, said both patients—aged 63 and 54-years --- showed moderate symptoms of the disease and were given the convalescent plasma therapy on Monday. “The patients started feeling better and their symptoms such as breathlessness and persistent fever has gone away,” said Dr Raman Sharma, senior professor of medicine at SMS hospital.“The patient’s oxygen saturation would fall if they walked a little bit. We saw that if the therapy is given timely, then the progression of the disease can be stopped. Now, their fever is gone and their oxygen saturation has improved,” Dr Sharma added.Dr Bhandari said while it will take longer to confirm the healing through X-ray and CT scan, but a sense of well-being and reduction in symptoms is seen within 12-14 hours of administering the plasma therapy.He added that in the coming days, three more patients could be given the therapy, depending on their condition.“Patients who move into stage two and three and show significant symptoms are not responding adequately and need oxygen support... so when the patients are in moderate to severe illness stage, they are considered eligible for plasma therapy,” he said.Rajasthan, on Sunday, received permission from the Indian Council of Medical Research to begin clinical trials for the convalescent plasma therapy.The state has so far recorded 3,193 Covid-19 cases and 90 deaths. The government has pinned its hopes on plasma therapy to help cure critical patients and bring down the death rate.The centre has stressed that plasma therapy is still in an experimental stage and should not be used for regular treatment of coronavirus patients until it is approved, otherwise, it may lead to life-threatening complications.Convalescent plasma therapy entails taking antibodies from cured Covid-19 patients and injecting them in the blood of active coronavirus patients.The antibody brings down the viral load in a patient, said Dr Sharma.A team of doctors at SMS hospital has studied the feasibility and technique of carrying out plasma therapy on critical patients.The blood bank in-charge at SMS hospital, Dr Bundas said the quantity of plasma taken from a donor ranges from 300-500 ml and the transfusion process takes 60-90 minutes.Mahatma Gandhi Hospital in Jaipur has also received permission from ICMR to conduct phase-II clinical trial of the plasma therapy, named as PLACID trial to assess its safety and efficacy in Covid patients with moderate infection, said Dr. Vikas Chandra Swaranakar, chairman of Mahatma Gandhi Medical University.He said the trials will begin soon at the Mahatma Gandhi Hospital, the only hospital in the private sector in the state to have earned the nod.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19The hospital said that people over the age of 18 who have been cured of coronavirus can donate their plasma voluntarily. The transfusion of donated plasma into a Covid-19 infected patient is done after consent. The results of the trial will be shared with ICMR.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-covid-19-patients-given-plasma-therapy-in-jaipur-condition-stable/story-cmUCK6Mjfn1CnNJKYHYCTM.html

Those who are staying with their relatives’ or in any other accommodation without any problems can’t be brought back.“So far till Tuesday, about 1.61 lakh people have registered themselves with the government website expressing their willingness to return to their home state,” chief secretary Utpal Kumar Singh said.“Out of the total, about 1.30 lakh are from Uttarakhand who are stranded in other states while about 30,000 are from other states stranded in our state and who want to return home in their states. We will bring all our stranded residents but gradually. They have to be patient as the process is not easy because we have to take all the required precautions while doing so,” said Singh. He also said that the state has so far evacuated about 5,700 people from different places in state road transport corporation buses.“The evacuation process is ongoing and in that, we have brought back total 5,669 people back to their home in Uttarakhand mainly from Chandigarh, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. Apart from this, about 7,000 residents who were stranded in districts other than their home districts within the state, have also reached home through government arrangements,” he said. The officer said that the government was taking all the necessary precautions in the evacuation process.“We are coordinating with other states where our residents are stranded so as to ensure their compulsory medical examination before bringing them home safely without them having any symptoms of Covid-19. After they reach here, our health workers are again examining them before sending them to their home districts,” said Singh. A 14-day home quarantine for all evacuees is mandatory while those showing symptoms will be taken to institutional quarantine. He said, “The government has also designated the district magistrates as additional nodal officers to coordinate with nodal officers of other states to facilitate the movement of stranded migrants without much problem.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-to-evacuate-all-1-3-lakh-of-residents-stranded-in-other-states/story-xvsXOhTa9pQacvdc972o8H.html

Keeping these issues in mind, FSSAI had issued detailed guidelines for food businesses during the Covid-19 pandemic … In a bid to enable and equip food businesses to function and reduce the risk of contagion, the FSSAI has launched a training programme for food businesses…,” the food regulator said in a statement.The online training programme is launched under FSSAI’s flagship operation, Food Safety Training and Certification Programme (FoSTaC), through its various empanelled training partners. Food businesses can visit www.fostac.fssai.gov.in to enrol in the certification programme.“The training programme caters to all stakeholders in the food ecosystem comprising manufacturers, packers, transporters, retailers, and food delivery partners and aggregators. The agencies/non-governmental organisations (NGOs) serving food in places, including community kitchens, should also get their food handlers trained for Covid-19 precautionary measures. A certificate of participation shall be issued to the trainees through the FoSTaC portal,” the FSSAI said.The training programme seeks to emphasise on food hygiene and sanitation to prevent the spread of the viral outbreak.“Practising social distancing by the staff is of utmost importance. It’s the responsibility of the employer to ensure the norms are properly followed. The module that FSSAI has created is pretty exhaustive and will help in putting in place infection control practices among food businesses,” said a senior official in the Union Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, requesting anonymity.FSSAI guidelines, which were issued earlier, advocated for mandatory use of personal protective equipment (PPE) kits such as masks, gloves, and headgear. It was suggested that a local emergency response team must be established in large food businesses to deal with suspected Covid-19 cases, and a person should be designated as the coordinator.“Proper hygienic practices such as the washing of hands, frequent use of alcohol-based hand sanitiser, cleaning, disinfection, and avoid close contact with a sick person need to be followed. Besides, wearing personal jewellery and watch should be discouraged along with the use of mobile phones at workplaces,” the guidelines had suggested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fssai-trains-food-businesses-to-mitigate-covid-19-risk/story-FgMc81tkGDk89P4aF8PNAJ.html

Monitoring is being done to ensure compliance of Covid-19 guidelines,” he said.The tea industry is the biggest industry in the state. But with lockdown to check the spread of Covid-19 coinciding with the start of the plucking season, the sector was severely hurt.Assam produced 715.49 million kg of tea in 2019, which was 51.51% of India’s total tea production. But due to the lockdown, the production figure is expected to dip by 32 million kg which translates to losses of more than Rs 500 crore.With relaxation of lockdown norms tea auction has restarted and warehouses resumed operations.Patowary said that the state government has engaged the services of Ernst & Young (E&Y) to study the impact of the lockdown on the industrial sector in Assam and suggest a policy framework to attract industries planning to move out of China.“There are speculations that many American, Japanese, Korean companies are contemplating shifting production facilities from China to India. To woo these companies, the Assam government has taken up the matter with Centre and Japanese and US trade and business organisations to try and attract some of them to Assam. The state has strategic location advantage, vast natural resources, robust industrial infrastructure and reliable connectivity,” said Patowary.The industries and commerce department of Assam is also in touch with the department of for promotion of industry and internal trade (DPIIT) of Government of India and Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) for setting up a Japanese industrial township in Assam to attract investment from Japanese companies.The minister also said that all government departments have been asked to extend the validity of trade licenses, permits, clearances to industries, shops and business establishments from March 31, 2020 to June 30, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/industries-tea-gardens-in-assam-resume-operations-as-lockdown-norms-relaxed/story-lr9PcIZwKUniTJ3lgJEzIK.html

State’s Home Secretary Alapan Bandopadhyay said this in reply to the Union Home Ministry letter. “We will take a call after considering all aspects. There are a lot of things that need to be looked into,” he said. The Centre during the day came down heavily on the West Bengal government for not allowing movement of essential goods through the Indo-Bangladesh border, saying such acts will have international implications. The MHA in a letter to the chief secretary also said the state government has not implemented repeated directions of the Centre for free movement of cargo and this amounts to violation of the Disaster Management Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-take-a-call-after-considering-all-aspects-bengal-govt-on-mha-letter-on-indo-bangla-trade/story-MKAXxzAKXT2rbGASca2y9L.html

In an apparent reference to Pakistan, he said one of India’s neighbours continues with its “nefarious and evil design” of abetting and promoting terrorist activities as well as using social media extensively to spin a fake narrative about the safety of certain communities in the country. India, with the second-largest Muslim population in the world, has remained deeply committed to the welfare of all minority groups since it became independent and is one of the pioneers of practising secularism in the real sense, Naidu said, adding there is no need for anybody to preach India on how to treat its people. “The perpetrators of terrorist activities are under a false impression that they can take advantage of the situation arising from the pandemic and succeed in their abominable practice,” he said in a Facebook post. Terrorist groups are trying to send infiltrators from across the border to create trouble in the country, he said apparently referring to the recent spate of encounters between security forces and terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir. Terror is a matter of grave concern for the entire world and every nation must stand united to defeat and wipe out terrorism, he said. “There is no room for complacency. The world while fighting the pandemic, must simultaneously declare war against terrorism,” he said. “It is unacceptable that these attempts to create schisms and divisions between communities and peddle hate and fear should continue unchecked,” he said. “We have to seek remedies for both the natural health pandemic as well as the man-created destructive mindset,” the vice president said. Both viruses, Naidu said, are destructive and impede human progress and drastically reduce the quality of life. “All nations must speak in one voice and come together in identifying and isolating nations which are sponsoring terrorism. The world, the vice president noted, has a health challenge that is threatening to change the way we live and work. It is a challenge we are collectively and individually coming to grips with. “We must not allow any other concern to assume dangerous proportions that will retard human welfare and divert our energies away from the most important task at hand,” he felt. “Pluralism, tolerance and celebration of diversity and goodwill towards all neighbours, both far and near, have been the cornerstones of the state policy (in India)” Naidu noted. Quite deplorably, India’s neighbour is using social media extensively to spin a fake narrative about the safety of certain communities living in India, he said. “This kind of false propaganda aimed at creating dissensions among different communities in India needs to be nipped in the bud. He said “equally disturbing is the attempt by some people within India, including a minuscule section of the media, to portray a wrong image of the country through false propaganda. All such attempts are highly condemnable. “ Naidu said India cannot allow the virus of terror, misinformation, and hatred assault it.  “We cannot allow anyone to fish in troubled waters and foment trouble and support terrorist organizations and activities,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/terror-perpetrators-trying-to-take-advantage-of-covid-19-pandemic-need-to-defeat-both-viruses-venkaiah-naidu/story-0ANzcDXP1e7xctlQGGCJbL.html

06-05-2020||India||In Karnataka’s Rs 1600-cr lockdown relief, Rs 5,000 for barbers, taxi drivers||To help stimulate economic activity in the state and to compensate for the loss of livelihoods, the Karnataka government unveiled an economic stimulus package worth Rs 1610 crore.As part of the package, the government has decided to pay Rs 25,000 per hectare up to a maximum of one hectare. Sixty thousand washer men (dhobis) and 2,30,000 barbers would also be given a one-time compensation of Rs 5,000.Also 7.75 lakh auto rickshaw and taxi drivers will be given Rs 5,000 each as a one-time measure as due to lockdown they have had no earnings.Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa made these announcements while addressing a press conference.The CM said the monthly fixed charges of electricity bills for MSMEs, who have suffered huge production losses due to the lockdown, will be waived for two months.Electricity consumers of all categories, the CM said, would be given incentive and concessions if they pay the bill in time. No electricity connections would not be disconnected till the end of June for consumers who have not paid their bills, the CM added.Weavers also were given a package with Rs 109 crore being set apart for weavers’ loan waiver schemes.Also 54,000 handloom weavers in the state would get Rs 2,000 each as a one-time measure.Pointing out that there are 15.80 lakh registered building workers in the state, Yediyurappa said they would get Rs 5,000 each as a one-time measure.To fund all these relief measures, the state has hiked liquor prices by 11%. This hike comes on the back of a 6% hike which was announced in the budget earlier, bringing the total hike on retail liquor prices by 17%.Siddaramaiah, leader of the opposition in Karnataka assembly, criticised the package as being completely inadequate and said that at least half of the losses suffered by farmers should be compensated.“Government should come forward and buy the vegetables, fruits and flowers grown by the farmers. The Rs 10,000 per acre compensation does not suffice even to spray pesticides on them. Also what about tanners, road side vendors, carpenters and others? It is unfortunate that the government has not done anything for large sections of the society which are suffering.”KPCC President DK Shivakumar also lashed out at the government for announcing ‘meagre and inadequate compensation package.’ He also demanded that a special assembly session be called to discuss the challenges faced by the public and how to address that.Reacting to this demand, CM Yediyurappa said that he is meeting a delegation of Congress leaders who have sought his time in the next few days and thus there was no need for any special session.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-karnataka-s-rs-1600-cr-lockdown-relief-rs-5-000-for-barbers-taxi-drivers/story-FbT6Qiv1yIUw7sXDfcGUkJ.html
06-05-2020||India||After Covid-19 pandemic, world will need new systems: RSS||The world should come together to avoid the recurrence of the Covid-19 pandemic and create new systems involving responsible individuals, organisations and countries, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh(RSS) joint general secretary Dattatreya Hosable said on Wednesday.The senior RSS functionary, in an interaction with foreign media persons through videoconferencing, said the limitations of ideologies of both “global capitalism and global communism” have exposed themselves in dealing with the pandemic.“The world will have to search for the emergence of a future world order, a new regime. Political ideologies based on politico-economic thoughts which have ruled the world for the last century have failed in today’s world. Unbridled materialism and consumerism will have to be questioned; and I hope humanity will try to free itself from this,” he said.To a separate question on the message to the Arab leadership on the perception that Indian Muslims are being discriminated against, Hosable said RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat has already made it clear that the entire community cannot be made a scapegoat for the acts of a few. “...Naming the whole community is not in the right spirit. The virus does not discriminate,” he said, adding that a few prominent Muslim leaders wrote to Bhagwat and welcomed his stand on the issue.The Sangh functionary also expressed hope that there will be a detailed inquiry carried out to investigate the origin, reason and impact of the pandemic.In response to a question on the US President’s Donald Trump’s statement on the need to investigate the reason and origin of the coronavirus, he said when there is a global crisis of this magnitude, it is for the international community to probe or fix responsibility.“…In any such conditions, it happens that the entire community through organisations with mandate and infrastructure and standing in the global system will go into that. Virus is virus; whether man-made or not is premature to say. It is in the interest of humanity is it good to probe; it is for better preparation in future,” Hosable said.The Sangh, which has steadfastly pushed for indigenisation, also had a message for the government: draft a detailed economic policy that will allow India of attract investments without harming the self-reliance and natural resources.“We will have to be very judicious; new measures will have to be announced so that MSMEs (micro, small and medium enterprises) and agriculture can stand on their own feet; but at the same time any countries cannot close its doors to the others,” he said.Commenting on Hosable’s statement, political commentator Shirish Kashikar said: “It is clear that all countries have to bring changes; India is the second most populous (country), and will have to be the first and others will follow.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-covid-19-pandemic-world-will-need-new-systems-rss/story-fz9fAmlrYDrR0xrRpVn2NJ.html

The tweet has been made from the private account of Malviya and not from the official handle of the organization which is being headed by Nadda, Rastogi reasoned. “This Court prima-facie finds that the tweet has been made by Amit Malviya and the present petitioner has no role in tweeting the information in question. The tweet is apparently from the private tweeting handle, and therefore, no role at this stage seems to be made out against the present petitioner,” observed Justice Pushpendra Singh Bhati.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-high-court-stays-action-of-fir-against-bjp-chief-jp-nadda/story-NGfZKxPaXwYoMjcp3BermK.html
06-05-2020||India||AIIMS Rishikesh’s system to remotely monitor Covid-19 patients is a handy containment tool||All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Rishikesh has launched a remote health monitoring system to cut the health staff’s exposure to coronavirus while bringing down the cost of hospitalising positive patients. The device has been named Monal after the state bird.Through this system, information on the health parameters of a coronavirus positive patient will get displayed in the control centre of the hospital while the patient recovers at home. If the health condition of any patient linked to this system suddenly worsens, then this device will inform the monitoring team and emergency help can be rushed to the patient in time. Professor Ravi Kant, director of AIIMS Rishikesh said that the device offers three main benefits.“This will prevent health care workers from unnecessary exposure to infection. Along with this, the ever-increasing demand for PPE kits will be curbed as patients will be monitored from a distance, and at the same time, the patient will receive healthcare at home while under intensive supervision of doctors day and night,” said Kant.Dr. Mohit Tayal, assistant professor from the department of radiodiagnosis, who was involved in the development of the device, says it is similar to a smartwatch that a suspected patient will have to wear on the wrist, which in turn will use sensors to monitor the patient’s health vitals.“It requires a suspected patient to download the application, which can be used to report their symptoms after registering with their mobile number. If the symptoms are similar to those of Covid-19, then a health team will visit to verify and take the person’s sample for test. If the doctors feel that the person is a potential case, then they will be given this device and home quarantined, after which their vitals will be monitored from a command centre at the hospital,” said Dr Tayal.Dr Tayal added that a person will be hospitalised if the vitals deviate from the normal range. “But otherwise, the main idea is to confine a potential patient to his home and control community transmission of the disease as a positive patient can spread the virus to dozens of people when quarantined at a healthcare facility,” added Dr Tayal.Dr Madhur Uniyal, staff officer at the institution said that the devise’s cost was even less than the cost of keeping a coronavirus positive patient in the hospital for a day.“As a result of this, the institution will be able to easily provide the benefit of medical services to more patients with fewer resources,” said Dr Uniyal.The device runs even on 2G internet and has already been tested on around 200 suspected patients.Chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat launched the system on Tuesday via video conferencing in presence of senior officials of AIIMS Rishikesh.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19While dedicating this device to the country and the state, Rawat named it after Uttarakhand’s official bird Monal, and said, “This device will bring a revolution in the battle against the coronavirus outbreak.”The device will be available for download on both iOS and Android platforms from the next week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aiims-rishikesh-s-system-to-remotely-monitor-covid-19-patients-is-a-handy-containment-tool/story-CDNMaymIr4kNrfo71lHGsK.html

So far, more than 25,200 samples have been taken and the tests helped us to identify more infected patients,” said District Collector Prakash Rajpurohit.Click here for full Covid-19 covergae.An analysis tracing of 712 people who were found positive by Tuesday afternoon showed that there were only 36 patients who got themselves tested at Mathuradas Mathur Hospital or All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Jodhpur when they felt symptoms of Covid-19. While 404 infected people were identified with contact tracing and 272 were found positive in targeted sampling. Many of these positive patients did not have any symptoms.Rajpurohit said, “Our goal is maximum testing, so that every possible infected person can be identified. By doing this continuously, the risk of virus infection will be minimized. With more testing, the number of positive patients can increase, but there is no need to worry about it. This will ultimately help in creating a virus free environment.”“We have done a comparative study of testing done per million per day in other countries, according to which 449 tests are being done daily in Jodhpur city. In Spain, the average is 435,while it is 205 in the USA, 375 in Italy and 307 in Germany,” Additional District Collector Mahipal Bhardwaj said.The Department of Medical and Health has now started sending messages on mobiles phones of all those who have tested negative for Covid-19. Areas where there have been no new positive cases for a long time are being removed from the list of containment zones, he added.Principal of SN Medical College, Dr. GL Meena said that the latest testing machine of Covid-19 will be installed soon. It will now be possible to test 3,000 samples simultaneously daily.

COVID-19 is the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus.Europe has sought up to 800 tonnes of paracetamol APIs every month, said Dinesh Dua, chairman of the Pharmaceuticals Export Promotion Council of India (Pharmexcil).Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverage“We have been under immense pressure from the European Union for the last 10 days,” Dua said.The European Union delegation in India did not immediately reply to an email from Reuters requesting comment on the planned shipment. Indian authorities have asked drugmakers to ensure the country is adequately stocked for up to four months of domestic requirements, Dua said. India, the world’s main supplier of generic drugs, has shipped 1.9 million tablets and other forms of paracetamol to 31 countries, the foreign ministry said late last month, adding that consignments of anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine and paracetamol were being sent to 87 countries on a commercial basis.Europe is India’s biggest buyer of paracetamol APIs and imports around 12,000 tonnes annually, according to Pharmexcil estimates. The common pain reliever is also sold as acetaminophen.The novel coronavirus outbreak has killed more than a quarter of a million people and Europe has accounted for 57% of the global death toll.India has so far reported more than 49,000 cases of COVID-19. The outbreak has not shown any signs of slowing despite a severe lockdown that has confined its population of 1.3 billion to their homes since late March. Health experts warn a surge of infections can overwhelm the country’s medical services. Indian pharmaceutical companies get almost 70% of the active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) for their medicines from China, where the virus had emerged late last year. “The country is vulnerable in terms of importing the drug’s intermediates from China,” Dua said.Pharmexcil counts dozens of pharmaceutical firms such as Pfizer Ltd
06-05-2020||India||Rana Kapoor, his wife and daughters named in ED chargesheet in Yes Bank scam||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has filed a chargesheet in connection with YES Bank scam against the bank’s former Chief Operating Officer and managing director Rana Kapoor, his wife and daughters before a special PMLA court in Mumbai on Wednesday.ED sources said that the chargesheet is filed against Rana Kapoor, his wife Bindu, daughters Rakhee Kapoor, Roshni and Radha and entities allegedly associated with them Morgan Credits, RAB Enterprises (India) private limited and Yes Capital India Private Limited.The agency has pegged the amount at around Rs 5,050 crore with 168 bank accounts under scrutiny of the central agency. The ED has provisionally attached 59 paintings, including an MF Husain painting of Rajiv Gandhi, seized during the raids.Special public prosecutor Sunil Gonsalves appeared before the special court and sought permission to file the chargesheet. Rana’s counsel Subash Jadhav requested that a copy should be supplied to the accused today itself. Subsequently, the court directed the agency to provide the copy to Rana.The chargesheet carries statements of key management persons of Yes Bank over the alleged irregularities. The agency had begun investigation based on the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) case for an alleged sham transaction with Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL).The agency has claimed that Yes Bank bought debentures worth Rs 3,700 crore of DHFL. In lieu of it, DHFL sanctioned a Rs 600-crore loan to Doit Urban Ventures Pvt Ltd, a company in which Kapoor’s daughters are directors. The loan was given without adequate collateral.The agency has been claiming that during his tenure, Kapoor was instrumental in sanctioning loans worth Rs 30,000 crore, out of which accounts worth Rs 20,000 crore have turned into a non-performing asset (NPA). Kapoor, it has been alleged, accepted illegal gratification while granting loans and money was diverted through these companies.Kapoor is under investigation for suspected money laundering along with his family members, through several shell companies that are being probed for diversion of funds. He is also under probe for his alleged role in engendering massive non-performing assets that led to a moratorium by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Yes Bank.

Manipur had two cases, Arunachal Pradesh and Mizoram one case each and Nagaland without any—taking the region’s total to 103 cases.The first case in the region was detected on March 24 when a 23-year-old woman who returned from the UK to Manipur was found positive. The same day, a 50-year-old pastor from Mizoram who had returned from the Netherlands also tested positive.The region reached the 50 cases mark on April 17—24 days after the first patient was tested positive. The figure doubled in the next 18 days.There have been recoveries too. With all their patients testing negative in consecutive tests, Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh and Mizoram have no active Covid-19 cases at present.In Assam, 33 patients, including the patient from Nagaland who was tested and treated in Guwahati, have recovered. Ten patients in Meghalaya have recovered and Tripura has recorded two recoveries.Fortunately, the number of Covid-19 fatalities in the region has also been low to date. Only Assam and Meghalaya have recorded one death each.At present, Tripura with 40 has the highest number of active cases, followed by 11 in Assam and only one in Meghalaya.While Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur and Mizoram have not reported any new case in more than a month, the number of cases has risen slowly in Assam with two people testing positive on Tuesday. Meghalaya has not recorded any new case since April 20. There has been a sudden spike in cases in Tripura, which had claimed Covid-19 free status on April 24 after the two patients had tested negative.But on May 2, two Border Security Force (BSF) personnel from the 138th battalion in Ambassa were found positive. A day later, 12 more people from the same battalion tested positive.The trend continued on May 4, with 13 new cases including two children from the same BSF battalion testing positive and on May 5 (Tuesday) another 13 tested positive—taking Tripura’s tally to 42—two recoveries and 40 active cases.The Tripura government has asked BSF to inquire the source of the infection in the battalion and reasons for its sudden spike. Due to the sudden rise in cases, Union ministry of home affairs (MHA) has declared Dhalai district, where the BSF battalion is stationed, as a red zone—the only one in the North-East.Four of Assam’s 33 districts and one of Meghalaya’s 11 districts are in the orange zone. All other districts in the seven states in the region are in the green zone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-cases-in-north-east-crosses-100-reaches-figure-in-42-days/story-nfl3vyHdfUDMemJguEe4aP.html

Rajasthan youth quarantines himself on neem tree amid Covid-19 lockdown||An 18-year old boy of a small village of Bhinder block of Udaipur, Rajasthan has set a new example on social responsibility amid the Covid-19 outbreak. The boy quarantined himself on a Neem tree near his house due to lack of a separate room for isolation. The youth had recently returned from another state and decided to isolate himself for precaution.Ishwar Lal Rawat, who belongs to Daabkiya village of Bhinder, quarantined himself on the tree as there was no extra room at his house. He wanted to keep himself away from the other members of his family.Three members of the same family returned to the village from Maharashtra and Gujarat. Two of them, including Ishwar, returned on May 3 from Surat while their brother, Pappu, reached on May 4. Upon getting the information of their arrival, a medical team approached them to get them quarantined.Also read: 548 doctors, nurses, paramedics infected with Covid-19 across IndiaIn the view of limited space within their house, Ishwar decided to quarantine himself on a Neem tree situated near his house. His family members also showed their support.The 18-year-old said he will follow all the government orders and will contribute in the battle against coronavirus.The process of home quarantine for the rural people is common these days, during the coronavirus outbreak, with scores of migrant workers returning to their native places.But at some places, people are ignoring the directions of the government, in that case, Bhinder’s Ishwar Rawat sets an example for others to follow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-space-no-problem-rajasthan-youth-quarantines-himself-on-neem-tree-amid-covid-19-lockdown/story-X3RfuJ2zLSgoUBKypJKSsK.html
06-05-2020||India||548 doctors, nurses, paramedics infected with Covid-19 across India: Report||Coronavirus has infected around 548 doctors, nurses and paramedics across the country so far, according to data maintained by the Centre, official sources said on Wednesday. The figure does not include field workers, ward boys, sanitation workers, security guards, lab attendants, peons, laundry and kitchen staff among others. According to an official source, it has not been ascertained from where these doctors, nurses and paramedic staff have acquired the infection. The figure includes doctors, nurses and paramedics from Centre-run and state government-run facilities across states and union territories. “No epidemiological investigation of the cases were done. So there is no clear segregation on how many contracted the disease at workplace and how many got it from the community,” the official source said. Several doctors, who tested positive for Covid-19, are also reported to have died in the country. Though their exact numbers were not immediately known. The official said that 69 doctors in the national capital have so far contracted the disease. Covid-19 has claimed 1,694 lives and infected 49,391 people nationwide till Wednesday morning. Besides, 274 nurses and paramedics have so far been infected by the virus. As many as 13 healthcare personnel, including seven resident doctors and a professor, have tested positive for coronavirus over the past two months at the Centre-run Safdarjung Hospital, the sources said. Around 10 healthcare workers, including a resident doctor and five nurses, have contracted the disease so far at the AIIMS. Besides, some security guards have also been infected in the premier hospital. Besides, several healthcare workers working in various central and Delhi government hospitals have also been infected by the disease, according to the data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/548-docs-nurses-paramedics-infected-with-covid-19-across-india-report/story-o2pM3w2adM4g3PXI6TBlkN.html
06-05-2020||India||Over 1 lakh migrants ferried in more than 100 Shramik Special trains: Railways||Over 100,000 stranded migrants have been ferried in more than 100 Shramik Special trains since the beginning of the services on the first day of this month, according to the railways ministry. Till Tuesday, Gujarat sent the maximum number of such trains (25) to other states, while Bihar received the most (13). Kerala sent 13 trains, according to internal data of the ministry. Other originating states include Telangana, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Rajashthan, Andhra Pradesh and Punjab. States where trains have terminated include Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Odisha, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Maharashtra. Till 1pm on Wednesday, 22 trains have already left originating stations, taking the number of trains ran till afternoon to over 100. Twenty more are likely to be deployed during the day. Eighty-eight special trains were operated by the national carrier across various zonal railways till Tuesday; most of these mainly originating from Bengaluru, Surat, Sabarmati, Jalandhar, Kota and Ernakulam, a ministry official said. Shramik Special trains, which began on May 1, are bound for a single destination without any stoppages. Usually, they have 24 coaches with each carrying a little over 50 in place of the total capacity of 72. These trains will run for distances of over 500km with at least 90% occupancy. A controversy has erupted over these trains with opposition parties alleging the Centre was forcing migrants to pay for ticket fares for their return to their home states.In its guidelines issued on Sunday, the railways ministry said state authorities shall collect fares after distributing tickets among migrants who are boarding these special trains, and hand over the amount to the Indian Railways. The railways has also said it will charge sleeper class fares and an additional Rs 50 for one point-to-point journey, while it also added that states can coordinate and pay on passengers’ behalf.In response to the Opposition’s criticism, the Union government and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) said the railways was bearing 85% of the fare cost, and states had to pay 15% to allow migrants return home free of cost.Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh tweeted on Wednesday that the railway ministry should “come clean on how it is charging full fare from every single migrant labourer travelling back home. All claims that the Centre is picking up 85% of the tab are completely false! Such complete lack of empathy for the poor is unheard of”.Generally, the railways recover about 57% of cost of travel on an average and the remaining is given as subsidy. On an average, it pays 43 paise per rupee for each ticket as subsidy. This is not a traditional subsidy, but is instead cross-subsidised from the money railways makes from its freight operations. Another controversy erupted on Tuesday, after the Karnataka government cancelled 10 trains from the state planned over the next five days. The trains were scheduled to ferry passengers to Bihar.Tejasvi Surya, Parliament member from Bengaluru south, said the state’s move will eventually benefit the workers.“It will help migrant labourers who came here with hopes of a better life to restart their dreams. Also, it will kickstart economic activities full throttle. Karnataka will emerge out of this stronger!,” he tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-over-100-shramik-special-trains-railways-ferried-100k-migrants-data/story-nx4ILHCVPELUkSedNaIPWP.html
06-05-2020||India||MoEF modifies definition of high tide line to spare Goa’s khazan lands||The Union Ministry of Environment Forests and Climate Change has amended the Coastal Regulation Notification 2011 to ensure that the High Tide Line (HTL) in Goa will be demarcated along the bunds (embankments) along rivers and creeks even if such bunds have since been breached or lie in a state of disrepair. The amendment came following a request by the Goa government.Prior to this, the HTL was demarcated depending on how far landward the saline water travelled during the high tide, which in case of a breached bund meant the HTL was demarcated further landward having huge implications on which land is defined as Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ). In a notification issued on May 1, the MoEF has added a clause to section 2 of the CRZ 2011 notification to allow for situation where “there exists a bund or a sluice gate constructed in the past, prior to the date of notification issued vide S.O. 114(E) dated 19th February, 1991, the HTL shall be restricted up to the line long along the bund or the sluice gate. “And in such a case, area under mangroves arising due to saline water ingress beyond the bund or sluice gate shall be classified as CRZ-IA irrespective of the extent of the area beyond the bund or sluice gate. Such areas under mangroves shall be protected and shall not be diverted for any developmental activities,” the amendment reads. The amendment allows for an exception to be granted to the current rule which mandates that “the distance upto which development along tidal influenced water bodies is to be regulated shall be governed by the distance upto which the tidal effects are experienced which shall be determined based on salinity concentration of 5 parts per thousand (ppt) measured during the driest period of the year and distance upto which tidal effects are experienced shall be clearly identified and demarcated.”The low lying lands known as ‘khazan lands, are protected from the high tides by a network of dykes and tide gates and have traditionally held multiple uses being used either as aquaculture ponds to breed fish and prawns in the monsoons, to plant rice during the winter growing season or to harvest salt in the summer, are now facing threats due to breaches in the dykes allowing for ingress of sea water as well as from reclamation for tourism purposes. Goa’s khazan lands date back to 400 AD, when the earliest references are found in literature, to lands that were protected from the sea and tides through a network of bunds and sluice gates that controlled the flow of water and ensured that the lands were cultivable. The network is considered an engineering marvel. According to government figures Goa boasts of 18,000 Ha. of khazans which is about 5% of the total geographical area of the state. Around 4,000 Ha. are estimated to have been lost over the last 30 years after they were inundated. Goa has been lobbying for this change ever since the National Centre for Sustainable Coastal Management (NCSCM) which has been tasked by the state government for drawing up the coastal zone management plan insisted that in areas where there was ingress of saline water would have to be marked as ‘tidal influenced water bodies’ and lands up to 100m from the water line would be notified as Coastal Regulation Zone bringing fresh areas under the stringent CRZ regulations. In August last year the Goa Environment Department wrote to the Ministry of Environment and Forests explaining the issue. The Coastal Zone Management Plan is a mandatory requirement under the CRZ notification. Goa is the last state to approve its Coastal Zone Management Plan under the CRZ notification 2011 which has been pending since 2014. An earlier draft plan placed before the government was rejected with the government telling the NCSCM that it could not be finalised owing to discrepancies. The Coastal Management Plan will now have to be redrafted according to the new definitions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/moef-modifies-definition-of-high-tide-line-to-spare-goa-s-khazan-lands/story-BBnqQubpwkzlV5VwqWZOHI.html

The district is left with only one active case now.On April 3, 2020, the first case was reported in the district which later increased to 38 cases in total out of which 36 have now recovered and discharged from the hospitals.Those discharged from the hospitals have been sent into quarantine again for observation. One patient had died during the initial days. Among them, 14 patients have been released from these centres as well.Also read: Post-Covid-19, the world will change. Here are 7 ways how this could happen“Right after the first case, micro-planning for teams was done by giving clearly demarcated areas for conducting a survey with one supervisor for every 10 survey teams. The survey teams were trained regarding COVID/ILI symptoms, checking persons having foreign travel history and prioritizing population affected in the disease epicentre,” Kumar Pal Gautam, district collector, Bikaner said. “We made a three-layer contact tracking list in which the first list had the people who were in direct contact with the patient. Second list had contacts of these people and the third list was contacts of people on the second list. All of these people were sent in institutional quarantine and were tested within two hours,” Gautam added.“The effort of the local administration came in handy as the total number of cases, in the beginning, was only from five localities. “The people belonging to the areas under curfew were screened nearly five times to make sure that not even a slightest chance is missed and people with severe ILI (influenza-like illness) symptoms were tested. All the results came out to be negative. Except one, all the positive cases have been discharged from the hospital and have been sent to quarantine centres for another check-up and kept in strict vigil. Nearly 14 people have been discharged from the quarantine centres as well,” informed the District Magistrate. “Notably, the containment efforts came out to be successful after the strict quarantine within 2 hours,” added the Bikaner collector.Gautam further said that to contain the virus, 175 people were kept in quarantine centres and more than 18,000 people were put in strict home quarantine. “A team of 60 officials meticulously tracks and works on the three-layer contact list. This was the biggest single unit that worked round-the-clock and tracked individuals falling under contact. Everyone was tracked, quarantined and then if required, tested,” said Gautam.While speaking on the availability of the essentials, the district collector informed that the teams are continuously delivering the products in containment areas and there has been no shortage of any item in the district. “Following the ‘protocol’ of the election, sector magistrates were also deployed along with area magistrates. Dairy products and essential goods were delivered directly to the houses and everything was being taken care of at a rigorous level,” said the district collector.Notably, luxury hotels in the district were spotted and listed as quarantine centres and every patient had one person to look after his/her daily needs, meals and everything else. Every individual placed in the duty of the patients who were tested positive had a duty to look after the patient on one-to-one basis. The process helped in extra care of the patients and helped them to recover well. 34 out of 36 cases were from the same cluster and 28 from the same family. Nearly, 111 contacts were sent to isolation after thorough tracing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-s-bikaner-turns-to-orange-zone-from-red-with-3-layer-covid-19-tracking-system/story-fpy4YvpD6k0V15gkWSprSI.html

Initially, the lockdown was enforced for 21 days from March 25, then extended for another 19 days till May 3 and from Monday further prolonged for 14 more days. Kolkata is among other metros, such as national capital Delhi and Mumbai, which is part of the 130 districts that have been earmarked as Covid-19 red zones, where lockdown 3:0 was enforced from Monday.Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverage“Earlier, we had started psychological counselling of Covid-19 patients undergoing treatment in hospitals and in quarantine centres. Now, we’ve launched a facility, where any person can call and avail of tele-counselling,” said a senior state health department official.The counselling session is available between 11am and 5pm on all seven days of a week.Any person seeking counselling can call on the helpline numbers of the health department and book a slot. Later, the person can call at the appointed time to receive counselling over the phone, the official said.Prolonged lockdown restrictions have necessitated the need for counselling, he added.“The growing fear of Covid-19 has triggered immense anxiety, stress, and insecurity in the minds of people. This stress is manifesting in various forms. People with pre-existing mental conditions are feeling threatened with an overload of information about the pandemic. Psychological crisis intervention is urgently needed for the timely prevention of hazards from the secondary mental health crisis. Counselling may also help overcome issues related to anxiety and stress and restore emotional balance,” said Kasturi Thakur, a clinical psychologist at a Kolkata-based state-run medical college and hospital. Covid-19 patients, who are undergoing treatment, and suspects, who have been kept in either institutional or home quarantine, are already undergoing counselling.Earlier, the state government had directed chief medical officers of all the districts to arrange counselling sessions in all institutional quarantine centres and other such facilities.The Union Ministry of Health & Family Welfare had also flagged the issue of mental stress of Covid-19 suspects, patients, and those who have recovered. The ministry had released a presentation “Minding our minds during the Covid-19” in April on how to cope up with fear, anxiety, panic, and other stress-related ailments, listing dos and don’ts.“We’ve deployed two psychologists and two psychiatrists, who are not only counselling Covid-19 suspects, but even doctors, nurses, and other healthcare workers treating these patients at the hospital. We’ve provided all our staff with the number of the psychologists and psychiatrists to make use of tele-counselling between 8 am and 8 pm,” said a senior doctor of a state-run hospital that is treating Covid-19 patients.A doctor of another state-run hospital said that the decision to deploy psychologists at quarantine centres was taken following reports that several patients were suffering from stress-related disorders during their 14-day quarantine period, where they have to remain isolated from their family members. Some refused to eat, some were not cooperating with doctors, some were too silent and some even made escape bids.“Many patients and even healthcare staff are suffering from anxiety, fear, depression, and other kinds of stress. Talking to a psychologist helps them to ventilate their stress. This is the key to a crisis situation. Tele-counselling is the best possible option, as it helps us maintain social distancing norms,” said Amit Kumar Bhattacharya, professor at the Institute of Psychiatry in Kolkata’s SSKM Hospital and Medical College.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-starts-psychological-counselling-of-citizens-to-beat-lockdown-stress/story-btbvGDGCdsDusiPdYiwN3H.html

Assam’s animal husbandry minister Atul Bora has said, despite the go-ahead from the Centre, the state government will not cull the animals immediately and choose an alternative option to prevent the spread of the disease.African swine fever, Atul Bora has said, was detected towards the end of February this year, but it started in April 2019 at a village in Xizang province of China bordering Arunachal Pradesh.What is African swine fever?African swine fever (ASF) is a severe, highly-contagious hemorrhagic viral disease of domestic and wild pigs. This transboundary animal disease (TAD) can be spread by live or dead pigs, domestic or wild, and pork products.It is caused by a large DNA virus of the Asfarviridae family, which also infects ticks of the genus Ornithodoros.Signs of African swine fever and classical swine fever (CSF) may be similar but the ASF virus is unrelated to the CSF virus.African swine fever is a disease listed in the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) Terrestrial Animal Health Code and must be reported to the OIE.Transmission and spreadRoutes of transmission can include direct contact with infected domestic or wild pigs.It can be through indirect contact by consumption of contaminated material—food waste, feed, garbage, contaminated fomites such as shoes, clothes, vehicles, knives, equipment, due to the high environmental resistance of ASF virus.It can also be transmitted through biological vectors—soft ticks of the genus Ornithodoros where presentPublic health riskAfrican swine fever is not a risk to human health. While swine flu can spread from animals to humans, African swine fever does not and therefore is not a public health threat.Signs of African swine feverSigns and mortality rates can vary according to the virulence of the virus and the type/species of pig.Acute forms of ASF are characterised by high fever, depression, anorexia and loss of appetite, haemorrhages in the skin (redness of skin on ears, abdomen and legs), abortion in pregnant sows, cyanosis, vomiting, diarrhoea and death within 6-13 days (or up to 20 days). Mortality rates may be as high as 100%.Subacute and chronic forms are caused by moderately or low virulent viruses, which produce less intense clinical signs that can be expressed for much longer periods. Mortality rates are lower, but can still range from 30-70%. Chronic disease symptoms include loss of weight, intermittent fever, respiratory signs, chronic skin ulcers and arthritis.Different types of pigs may have varying susceptibility to ASF virus infection. African wild suids may be infected without showing clinical signs allowing them to act as reservoirs.DiagnosisAfrican swine fever may be suspected based on clinical signs but confirmation must be made with laboratory tests, particularly to differentiate it from classical swine fever (CSF).

Article 253 of the Constitution deals with the legislation for giving effect to international agreements while articles 256 and 257 give powers to the Centre for issuing directions to the state that are obligatory for latter.“It has been reported that goods traffic through border crossings between India and Bangladesh, falling in West Bengal, has still not resumed. As a result, a large number of trucks carrying essential supplies, bound for Bangladesh, are stranded at different border crossing points,” the home secretary wrote in his letter.“A number of drivers of such vehicles, while returning from Bangladesh, have also not been allowed to cross the border, and are stranded in Bangladesh,” Bhalla added.He reminded the state government of lockdown measures issued on May 1 according to which no state/union territory shall stop movement of cargo for cross-border land trade under treaties with neighbouring countries.He directed the Bengal chief secretary to allow access land border transportation through all Indo-Bangladesh borders “without any further delay” and send the compliance report by Wednesday.During a meeting between cabinet secretary Rajeev Gauba and the states last month, West Bengal home secretary Alapan Bandopadhyay claimed that everything was under control in his state till Bhalla reminded him of hundreds of loaded trucks stuck at the Indo-Bangladesh border in West Bengal that need to be unloaded for Bangladesh. The state had argued that there is an issue about mingling of workers who handle goods from both sides. Bhalla reminded the state that the trucks contain essential supplies for Bangladesh and they cannot remain stranded in such a way.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-tells-bengal-to-open-b-desh-border-cites-international-commitments/story-hDUmdiuiwxFEP1PAGx3vbN.html

Besides direct financial assistance, PMGKY, targeted at 390 million beneficiaries, included free distribution of wheat, rice, pulses and cooking gas cylinders. In a statement, the finance ministry said the government was front-loading payment of Rs 16,394 crore towards the first instalment of payment to 81.9 million beneficiaries under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KiSAN) scheme PM-KISAN, launched on December 1, 2018, provides cash support of Rs 6,000 per year to farming households across the country in three equal instalments. While launching the Rs 1.7 lakh crore relief package on March 26, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the Rs 2,000 first instalment under PM-KISAN this fiscal year would be front-loaded and paid immediately.The finance ministry statement said Rs 10,025 crore had already been credited to over 200 million (98.33%) women account holders under the Jan Dhan Yojana; it was towards the first instalment of three monthly payments of Rs.500 to women to tide over difficulties caused by Covid-19 and its aftermath. The government has also credited Rs. 2,785 crore to 55.7 million women Jan Dhan account holders in the second instalment as of May 5, it said.The finance ministry said Rs 1,405 crore has been disbursed to about 28.2 million elderly, widows and disabled. On March 26, Sitharaman had promised an ex-gratia payment of Rs 1,000 to 30 million poor senior citizens, widows and divyang (disabled) to cope with economic disruptions caused by Covid-19.About 22 million building and construction workers have received financial support amounting to Rs 3,492.57 crore, the statement said.Besides cash transfers, the government has already distributed foodgrains to millions of poor, it said. The PMJKY promised 5 kg wheat or rice and 1 kg of preferred pulses free every month till June this year to 800 million poor.According to the finance ministry statement, 960,000 members of the Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) had availed of the benefit of online withdrawal of non-refundable advances from their EPFO accounts amounting to Rs. 2,985 crore. The government also transferred 24% EPF contribution to nearly 4.5 million employees’ accounts amounting to Rs 698 crore, it said.To help low-wage earners in the organised sector, the government on March 26 announced that it would pay 24% of monthly wages into the PF accounts of people who earn below Rs 15,000 per month, employed in businesses having less than 100 workers, for the next three months.“This would prevent disruption in their employment,” Sitharaman had said while announcing the welfare package.The government has also notified the increased wage rate under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Programme (MGNREGA) effective from April 1, 2020, the finance ministry said.Sitharaman had raised wages for MNREGA workers under the PMJKY package by Rs 20 a day with effect from 1 April to provide an additional Rs 2,000 benefit a year to workers.PMGKY had also promised insurance cover of Rs 50 lakh per health worker engaged in the fight against Covid-19. “Insurance Scheme for Health workers in Government Hospitals and Health Care Centres has been operationalised by New India Assurance covering 22.12 Lakh health workers,” the finance ministry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-provided-direct-cash-benefits-of-rs-34-800-cr-to-390-million-poor-till-may-5/story-NUoYdV8z2nxbe7eW7BFiAI.html

Jammu and Kashmir director general of police Dilbag Singh was supervising the operation.Also read : Riyaz Naikoo, Kashmir’s most wanted terrorist, carries Rs 12 lakh rewardA senior police officer described Riyaz Naikoo’s elimination as a huge success.Naikoo is learnt to be close to the Pakistan-based Hizbul chief, Syed Salahuddin, who was declared a global terrorist by the US in 2017.Naikoo had taken over as chief of the terror group after the outfit’s Kashmir commander Burhan Wani was gunned down in July 2016.The tech-savvy Naikoo, who used to give private tuitions to school children before joining Hizbul Mujahideen, had played a crucial role in holding the terror group’s hold in the valley after the group’s Zakir Musa split the outfit in 2017 to form his own group Ansar Ghazwatul Hind.Zakir Musa’s new outfit was claimed to be an affiliate of Al Qaeda. Musa didn’t get to lead the new outfit for long. He was killed in an encounter in Tral in May last year. Also read : Who is Riyaz Naikoo, Kashmir’s most wanted militant?Naikoo, however, had been awfully lucky. In Kashmir, where the career span of terrorists rarely exceeds four years, Naikoo lasted eight years.He had been cornered by the security forces in Kashmir on several occasions but had managed to slip out every time. One reason, a J&K police officer told Hindustan Times, that when the police got the initial input about the presence of Kashmir’s most-wanted terrorist, police chief Dilbag Singh quickly got into the picture to oversee the entire operation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/riyaz-naikoo-top-hizbul-mujahideen-terrorist-killed-in-pulwama-encounter/story-aPZOgGE1lfaaYDwXHoy7RK.html

The matter came to light after the state police headquarters received four screenshots of the fake Facebook posts, claiming that CM Rawat is dead.“On Wednesday morning, we received some screenshots of Facebook posts mentioning the sudden death of CM which was as shocking as it was fake. We took suo moto cognisance of the matter and decided to take strict action immediately,” said Ashok Kumar, director general (DG), law & order, Uttarakhand police.DG Kumar said the Dehradun police has been asked to register a case in the matter.“A case is being registered by Dehradun police against all those who posted the fake news. Nobody will be spared, including those who posted it and the conspirators. All will be arrested soon,” said Kumar. The officer said the state police have already warned people that stern action will be taken against those who are found to be spreading rumours or fake news. “We had already warned of strict action against such people. However, this has crossed all limits. What was circulated by some people on Facebook was highly condemnable and absolutely fake,” said Kumar. One of the posts by a user named Narendra Mehra read, “Dukhad samachar mukhyamantri manniya Shri Trivendra Singh Rawat ka dil ka daura padne se akasmik nidhan. Bhagwan punya aatma ko shanti pradan kare (Sad news. Chief minister Shri Trivendra Singh Rawat passed away due to cardiac arrest.

If international prices jump, states which levy ad valorem duties on petrol and diesel gain revenue proportionately, but they lose revenue when international oil rates fall. The Centre levies specific excise duty on the two fuels. Pump prices of petrol and diesel are different in different states because of variations on sales tax or VAT rates and other local levies. State-run oil companies have not been revising the rates of the two auto fuel rates, making up for their present and potential inventory losses, since March 16.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/petrol-prices-go-up-by-rs-2-per-litre-and-diesel-price-goes-up-by-re-1-per-litre/story-x4ZYxoCJny0Na8DxLZ0KTK.html
06-05-2020||India||Maharashtra an area of concern for us: Harsh Vardhan in Covid-19 review||Maharashtra is a cause for concern with 34 of its 36 districts affected by the coronavirus disease, Union health minister Harsh Vardhan told state authorities while reviewing the Covid-19 situation on Wednesday.In the online meeting with state health minister Rajesh Tope, Vardhan highlighted that seven districts — Mumbai, Thane, Pune, Nashik, Nagpur, Aurangabad and Sholapur—have been reporting heavy case load, and need special focus to contain the spread of the disease. The western state has 26 containment zones, which are earmarked pockets in red or orange zones where there are no relaxations of lockdown rules. The two districts that are in green zone (no case reported in at least 21 days) are Gadhchiroli and Wardha, which are about 200km apart.Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageTill 2pm on Wednesday, Maharashtra reported 15,525 of 49,391 cases in India, and 617 of the country’s 1,694 deaths.“Maharashtra is an area of concern for us at the moment as higher number of cases is being reported from the state. Experts from the central team are stationed there to help the state government. The teams from National Centre of Disease Control (NCDC) are also closely monitoring the situation, and looking at ways by which we can reduce the number of cases,” Vardhan said during the review.“The Centre is ready to help in every way possible — be it manpower increase, capacity building, technical assistance etc. or any kind of handholding that is required to manage the situation. We have to get into the minute details to devise a better strategy for disease control,” he said.He also directed experts from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Nagpur, to take help in local surveillance.“Even though rapid response teams of all medical colleges are active at the ground level, I would ask AIIMS, Nagpur, to also proactively assist the state government in managing the disease in the district since they are located in the district. We are in constant touch with all district magistrates who are managing the situation on ground. The idea of this review is to redefine the strategy in these severely affected areas for better outcome,” he added.Apart from Maharashtra, the Union health minister later in the day is also scheduled to review the situation in Gujarat, which is another state reporting high case load of Covid-19.Last week, the health minister conducted a digital meeting with Delhi, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar, and is expected to hold meetings with other states in the coming weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashta-an-area-of-concern-for-us-harsh-vardhan-in-covid-19-review/story-LT21CQg9VafJJPMj3mbmCN.html

BJP leader Kailash Vijayvargiya, who is the national general secretary of the party, has said in a letter to West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee that he remains concerned at the quality of information being furnished by the state on coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases. “...bulletin released on May 4 have some glaring discrepancies with regard to the data. I have listed them and hope that your administration will rise to a higher level of transparency and provide information, which people can use to assess state government‘s preparedness to take on the Goa challenge and defeated,” the letter says. He has also said there is no mention of the number of people deprived of tests and thereafter “clandestinely” buried or cremated. “Non-availability of such data may be costly for epidemiological analyses and also deprives the families of the deceased from getting due compensation announced by the government,” the letter says.The Trinamool Congress government and the BJP have been sparring on the issue of the state‘s handling of the coronavirus disease pandemic.In the letter issued on Tuesday, Vijayvargiya has said Alipurduar district is shown to have no cases but multiple mainstream media reports have shown at least four cases in the district.The health bulletin of the West Bengal government dated May 4 shows no deaths due to Covid-19 in Paschim Bardhaman district, but the chief secretary is himself on record at a press conference on April 21 admitting to one death in the district, the letter says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-letter-to-mamata-bjp-questions-bengal-s-covid-19-data/story-Z8tsen2gchlAELZkG4R5oI.html
06-05-2020||India||Riyaz Naikoo, Kashmir’s most wanted terrorist, carries Rs 12 lakh reward||The gunfight in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pulwama district has brought the spotlight back on Riyaz Ahmed Naikoo, the most wanted terrorist in the valley.Security forces had launched the operation to nab Hizbul Mujahideen terrorist Riyaz Naikoo on Tuesday night on a specific input Beigpora Gulzapora in Awantipora.“Contact established in the third operation at #Beighpors #Awantipur. Top terrorist commander is trapped. Exchange of fire on. Details shall follow,” J&K police tweeted.Riyaz Naikoo took over as the chief of Hizbul Mujahideen after the outfit’s poster boy Burhan Wani was killed in a gunfight with the security forces in Kokarnag area in Anantnag district on July 8, 2016.A post-graduate, he carries a reward of Rs 12 lakh on his head.A resident of Naikoo Mohalla in Durbug of Awantipora, Riyaz Naikoo has been listed as a category “A++” militant, which is given to the most-wanted terrorist in the Valley. He took over as chief of the Hizbul Mujahideen in the Valley after the killing of his associate Sabzar Bhat in May 2017.“Naikoo is now considered to be the overall commander of Hizbul Mujahideen (HM) for the entire Valley. In the last one year, the security forces cornered him many times but each time he has managed to escape,” a central security force official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, had said while speaking to HT.Naikoo, the officer had said, has assiduously cultivated an image of a moderate militant.He is said to have worked as a mathematics teacher at a local school before joining the terrorist ranks. He was known to have a passion for painting roses before he picked up the gun.Naikoo had released a video in 2017, saying he would welcome the return of Kashmiri Pandits in the Kashmir Valley and claimed that terrorists were not enemies of the Pandits.Riyaz Naikoo is also believed to be behind the revival of the “Gun Salute” that terrorists give to their fallen comrades at their funeral.Security officials also believe Naikoo has managed to draft many young people from south Kashmir into militancy due to his image.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/riyaz-naikoo-kashmir-s-most-wanted-terrorist-carries-rs-12-lakh-reward/story-QEM18LWyY1AjsPXnqGqD4H.html
06-05-2020||India||‘What after May 17?’: Sonia Gandhi seeks answer from Centre||Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Wednesday asked the central government to spell out its strategy whether it will lift or continue with the nationwide lockdown on May 17.“What after May 17? What criteria is the government using to judge how long the lockdown will continue?” she said in her opening remarks at a video-conferencing of the party’s chief ministers and senior leaders.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had first announced the 21-day nationwide lockdown to contain the deadly coronavirus disease from March 25 to April 14. The restrictions were first extended till May 3 and then further extended till May 17.The Congress president also thanked the farmers, particularly of Punjab and Haryana, for ensuring food security due to the bumper wheat crop despite all odds.Addressing the meeting, former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said, “We need to know, as Soniaji said, what will happen after the lockdown 3.0?. The CMs need to deliberate and ask as to what is the strategy of the government of India to get the country out of lockdown?”Former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi said the central piece of strategy to fight Covid-19 is to protect the elderly and those who are diabetic and with heart conditions.The meeting comes days after Gandhi announced that her party will pay for the train travel of stranded migrant workers, a move that triggered a slugfest between the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The opposition party accused the government of being insensitive to the plight of stranded migrant workers while the BJP claimed that railways was bearing 85% of the fare cost, and state governments had to pay 15%, thus allowing migrants to go back home free of cost.On his part, Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh said his government has set up two committees to strategise – one on how to come out of the lockdown and other on suggesting ways and means for the economic revival.“Our concern is the people sitting in Delhi are deciding on classification of zones without knowing what is happening on the ground,” he said.His Rajasthan counterpart Ashok Gehlot demanded financial assistance from the Centre to states to sustain the impact of the Covid-19.“Until an extensive stimulus package is given, how will states and the country run? We have lost Rs 10,000 crore of revenue. States have repeatedly requested the Prime Minister for a financial package but we are yet to hear from the Centre,” he said.Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel said states are facing an acute economic crisis and need immediate financial assistance.“Chhattisgarh is one state where 80% of small industries have restarted and nearly 85,000 workers have returned to work,” he claimed.His Puducherry counterpart V Narayanasamy said the Centre is deciding on zones without consulting the states. “This is creating an anomalous situation. People sitting in Delhi cannot tell the states, No state or chief minister is consulted. Why? The Prime Minister is not saying a word on the economic package for states,” he said.Former finance minister P Chidambaram said states are bleeding in terms of finances but no money is being allocated by the Centre. “The media too has brought out the unavailability of finances with states,” he added.For his part, former union minister M Veerappa Moily said the strategy to declare the lockdown or coming out of it has not been stated at all by the Prime Minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-after-may-17-sonia-gandhi-seeks-answer-from-centre/story-p5dwKexYjYcuVsWIL7mLqK.html

06-05-2020||India||‘Creaky and cumbersome’: PM Modi orders overhaul of drug regulatory system||At a late Tuesday afternoon meeting, Prime Minister Narendra Modi showered praise on academics, industry and start-ups for setting aside their reservations and joining hands to power India’s research to develop tests, vaccines and drugs for Covid-19. But PM Modi had one lurking concern.This was about the ability of the regulatory framework to keep pace with industry and scientists. PM Modi, who has on occasions spoken how the bureaucracy and its systems weren’t able to keep pace, said India’s regulatory system for new drugs and vaccines was still “creaky and cumbersome” at the best of times. This, Prime Minister Modi told the meeting of top government officials, had to change. Fast.“The prime minister underscored that we not only had to have the highest quality, ethical standards but also the highest speed,” a senior government official who was present at the meeting of the task force on coronavirus vaccine development, drug discovery, diagnosis and testing told Hindustan Times.Among those who were present at the meeting were principal secretary to the PM PK Mishra, principal scientific adviser to the government K VijayRaghavan, advisor to PM Amarjeet Sinha, biotechnology department secretary Renu Swarup, Indian Council of Medical Research director general Balram Bhargava, Union health secretary Preeti Sudan and Rajesh Bhushan who will take over as health secretary three months later.“This means we need to overhaul the regulatory system, that too at warp speed,” one official later told HT. He explained one aspect of the concern around the regulatory framework that the prime minister had articulated.In the United States and Europe, there are provisions to conduct human trials on emergency clearance basis. In India, it can take drug companies months to even conduct trials on mice.Besides, an official explained by way of an example, if a drug such as Remdesivir of Gilead Sciences turns out to be a success in the United States, it will take a considerable time to reach the medicine to Indian patients due to red tape in the entire system of drug approvals. “We really need to revamp the approval processes at the drug controller’s office,” he said.In the course of Tuesday’s meeting, when a participant spoke about India’s dependence on one country for supply of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API), Prime Minister Modi underlined that companies need to take pride in manufacturing API also rather than relying on other countries. It should be a matter of pride… not just low costs, PM Modi said.In the early part of the task force meeting, PM Modi was told that there were 30 Indian vaccines in different stages of development including a few that were going on to the trial stage.

Governments must borrow to meet their deficits, not impose higher tax burdens when economic activity has ground to a halt,” Chidambaram tweeted on Wednesday. He said the imposition of new or higher taxes makes sense only when the economy is booming.  New or higher taxes will impoverish families further. Governments must borrow to meet their deficits, not impose higher tax burdens when economic activity has ground to a halt.“Tax burdens on the middle class and poor is actually taxing distress,” the former finance minister said. “We have been pleading for cash transfers from the government to the bottom half of the people/families. Instead governments are doing a REVERSE TRANSFER of money from the people to the government! Cruel,” he added.Governments should GIVE money to the people in times of distress, not SQUEEZE and TAKE money from the people. Earlier this week, the Kejriwal government announced an increase in value-added tax (VAT) on petrol and diesel to raise money to fight the coronavirus disease. This decision had increased the price of petrol by Rs 1.67 per litre to Rs 71.26 and diesel, by Rs 7.10 to Rs 69.39.The Centre on Tuesday raised the excise duty on petrol by Rs 10 and on diesel by 13 per litre to recoup some of the loss of revenue suffered by the government due to the Covid-19 lockdown. However, the change in the tax structure will not impact the retail sale price of petrol and diesel on account of the excise duty hike.Besides this, some of the states, including Delhi, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal and Rajasthan, had announced an increase in the excise duty for liquor as alcohol stores lifted shutters after nearly a 40-day lockdown on Monday. Delhi increased the tax by 70%, Andhra by 75%, West Bengal by 30% and Rajasthan by 10%, all to raise funds to fight the pandemics and manage state finances, the governments said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/borrow-to-meet-deficits-not-impose-higher-taxes-p-chidambaram-s-covid-19-message-to-centre-states/story-6LvcXQbzX6nnedueYgU3eK.html

There are 14,182 people who have been cured or discharged, the health ministry data showed.Lav Agarwal, joint secretary with the health ministry, had said during the routine press briefing held on Covid-19 on Tuesday that the doubling rate of the respiratory disease had improved from 3.4 days before the lockdown to 12 days now. The nationwide lockdown was first clamped on March 25, which has been extended twice, and the third phase will end on May 17. “Lockdown has yielded very positive results, doubling time has improved from 3.4 days before lockdown to 12 days now. At the same time, it is important that we sustain the momentum,” said Agarwal.He said it was important to trace every contact of infected people.“Conducting surveillance for SARI (Severe Acute Respiratory Infection) and ILI (Influenza-like illness) symptoms in facilities in containment zones and otherwise yields very valuable data and guides further action,” Agarwal said.Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan had said on Tuesday that India had managed to keep a check on coronavirus pandemic by not letting it slip into the community transmissions phase. Globally, more than 3.6 million have been infected by Sars-Cov-2, which causes the disease, and 257,207 people have died, according to Johns Hopkins Covid-19 tracker.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-covid-19-tally-crosses-49-000-mark-death-toll-at-1-694/story-3f5BmqzkP8gS3OulOxPPpI.html

If behavioural changes such as hand, environmental and respiratory hygiene, which are being practised more rigorously during this period, get imbibed in society it will become the new normal,” Vardhan said.“Other than smallpox and polio, no other viral infection has been completely eradicated from this country. Other diseases keep recurring,” the minister said, indicating that Covid-19 might be here for the long haul.The total number of cases came very close to 50,000-mark Wednesday. The Union health ministry data on Wednesday morning showed the country recorded 2,958 new cases and 126 deaths in the last 24 hours (between Tuesday and Wednesday).On Tuesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi chaired a meeting of a taskforce on the coronavirus vaccine development, drug discovery, diagnosis and testing and reviewed India’s efforts in the fight against Covid-19, news agency PTI reported.There are concerns that India’s tally may increase further with the government announcing plans to bring back a large number of Indians from various countries, in what is being called the world’s biggest ever evacuation programme. PTI reported that over three lakh people have registered for the evacuation from the Gulf region itself.The absolute number of cases and the death toll in India is lower than many others - more than 2.5 lakh people having lost their lives and over 35 lakh having been infected worldwide ever since the emergence of this virus in China last December.The focus now seems to have shifted globally towards developing a vaccine with several world leaders committing more than US $8 billion since Monday for this purpose.The government officials, meanwhile, maintained that India has managed to stave off a community transmission risk and the country remains in a “comfortable” position in terms of managing the Covid-19 crisis.The recovery rate in India has improved to 28.17 per cent, joint secretary at the health ministry Lav Agarwal said during a press briefing on the Covid-19 situation on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-will-remember-covid-19-as-blessing-in-disguise-says-health-minister/story-VvnZU8GPlMUHRsMXfqHXyL.html
06-05-2020||India||Pfizer injects first US patients in Covid-19 vaccine clinical trial, more on way||Several US companies are racing to develop vaccines against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), which has affected more than 3.5 million and killed 257,207 people across the world.US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc has administered the first US patients with its experimental vaccine and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals said an antibody treatment could be available by this fall. Gilead Sciences Inc is working to expand manufacturing of its virus treatment, remdesivir, for use around the world.Regeneron said an experimental antibody treatment for Covid-19 could be available as soon as this fall, an expedited timeline for a drug that’s scheduled to be studied in humans for the first time in June.Regeneron’s chief scientific officer George Yancopoulos said on Tuesday during a conference call with investors that to meet the fall timeline will “depend on a lot of factors,” including whether the treatment works as well as hoped, “and there is obviously a lot of risk”. “We’ve sort of done it before but now we are trying to take it to the next level,” Yancopoulos said.The trials by Pfizer, which has partnered with Germany’s BioNTech SE, are being conducted at the New York University Grossman School of Medicine in Manhattan and the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore, the drugmaker said on Tuesday.“The short, less than four-month time-frame in which we’ve been able to move from preclinical studies to human testing is extraordinary,” Pfizer’s chief executive officer Albert Bourla said in a statement.Researchers said they have begun injecting volunteers with the first of four vaccine shot, which uses a gene-based technology known as messenger RNA, from Pfizer and BioNTech. The first person was vaccinated on Monday.The RNA, after being injected into the body, slips into human cells and tells them to produce the viral proteins that then cause the body to develop protective antibodies. It’s not a technology that has been approved for use yet. The RNA technology has an advantage as it can move faster into trials because it doesn’t involve brewing batches of protein or inactivated viral particles in living cells, which can take months.The trial has begun with healthy, young people between the ages of 18 and 55. But as safety is established in that population, it will expand to an older group of study participants—people up to the age of 85.The trial will help researchers evaluate whether the vaccine candidates are safe, which produces the strongest immune response that could fend off the coronavirus and what the doses should be.The study is being conducted on 360 people whose results could come as early as next months. Kathrin Jansen, Pfizer’s head of vaccine research and development, however, said the vaccine will still need to undergo additional testing in more patients. She added they will track the study’s progress to pick the most promising vaccine candidate.Bourla told The Wall Street Journal last week that a vaccine against coronavirus could be ready for emergency use as early as the falls if everything goes well.Pfizer and BioNTech are also in a race with Moderna, Johnson & Johnson and dozens of other biopharmaceutical outfits and academic groups to come up with a safe and effective vaccine against the illness within the next year to 18 months.

According to an Ipsos survey, more than half (51 per cent) of them favour opening up of economy and businesses, but an overwhelming majority (78 per cent) are nervous about leaving their homes for work and travel.There were 28,000 respondents in the global online survey which was carried out between April 16 and 19.People in eight out of the 14 countries surveyed said that they do not want the economy to open till the time the spread of the virus is fully contained. These countries are United Kingdom, Canada, Mexico, Spain, Australia and the United States.But in India, Russia, China, Italy and Germany, more respondents agree that reopening should take place.Interestingly, people in India are were also most undecided on whether the economy should reopen if the virus is fully contained, according to Ipsos.As per the latest update by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, the total number of Covid-19 positive cases in India stands at 46,711, including 13,161 recovered/migrated and 1,583 deaths.The United States has been hit the hardest by the global pandemic. New confirmed infections per day in the US exceed 20,000, and deaths per day are well over 1,000, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University.Public health officials warn that the failure to flatten the curve and drive down the infection rate in places could lead to many more deaths - perhaps tens of thousands - as people are allowed to venture out and businesses reopen.On Monday, a model from the University of Washington nearly doubled its projection of Covid-19 deaths in the US to around 1,34,000 through early August, with a range of 95,000 to nearly 2,43,000.Meanwhile, Britain’s official coronavirus death toll, at more than 29,000, topped that of Italy to become the highest in Europe and second-highest in the world behind the United States.

It directed the domain registrar to block the name. Brainlink admitted to not using the domain name since 2000, but had blocked it .Brainlink offered to sell the domain name to HT Media “at an exorbitant price” in an unsuccessful attempt, according to the case made out against the firm.The court observed that the firm’s bad faith could be inferred from the extortionist price quoted for the sale of the trademark and that HT’s “goodwill spills over Internationally” to other countries. Brainlink also filed a suit in New York Court to prevent HT from availing further legal remedies. The suit was an attempt to legitimise the alleged infringement,HT said, and made a prima facie case for an anti-suit injunction before HC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trademark-case-ht-media-wins-against-us-based-company/story-AAU6LoFqHkdd1qavVZwbjN.html

At least four drugs are undergoing synthesis and examination in this category,” the statement said.“Secondly, the development of new candidate drugs and molecules are being driven by linking high performance computational approached with laboratory verification. Thirdly, plant extracts and products are being examined for general anti-viral properties,” it added.Several academic research institutions and start-ups have developed new tests, both for the Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) approach and for antibody detection, in diagnosis and testing. Capacity for both these tests has been enormously scaled up by linking laboratories across the country.“The problem of importing reagents for testing has been addressed by consortia of Indian start-ups and industry, meeting current requirements. The current thrust also holds promise for the development of a robust long-term industry in this area,” the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/more-than-30-covid-19-vaccines-in-different-stages-of-development-scientists-tell-pm-modi/story-cAvTRd5hSkOq9YtHC81UuO.html

Praying, the 43-year-old jumped onto her bicycle and rode the three kilometres to her home as fast as she could. When she reached, 20 minutes later, her daughter was no more.Two days later — after cremating her child — Behera reported for duty.The sole breadwinner of her family consisting of ailing parents and a younger brother with mental health issues, Behera had little choice. “I have to keep working so that no one in the family goes hungry,” said Behera, who earns Rs 500 for a day’s work. Home guards in Odisha do not have a fixed monthly salary and are paid on the basis of the number of days they serve.Praising her dedication, director general of home guards and fire services, Sunil Roy said Behera is an inspiration, and has urged the state government to include home guards in the Rs 50 lakh insurance scheme that the police personnel are currently covered by in the state.A similar tragedy struck sub-inspector Dusha Palka, posted at the Ambadola police station in Rayagada district. Palka lost his mother on April 21 and joined duty after the cremation.In Chandbali block in Bhadrak district, tehsildar Sushant Sutar has been ensuring that no one goes out of containment zone and enforcing physical distancing, even as his father was battling for life in the ICU of a private hospital in distant Cuttack. Sutar’s father fell from the stairs and was injured last month.In Deogarh district’s Barkote police station, constable Sanjukta Patra has been reporting for duty since April 9, three days after she was discharged from hospital. Patra had suffered a major injury on her spine after a debilitating road accident and was advised bed rest post discharge, but Patra chose to return to work.In Jharsuguda, 24-year-old Chandrika Singh gave birth in January. A home guard, Singh has been bringing her son to work at the Laikera police station. “I took permission from my senior officers to join work. As it was impossible to leave my child at home, I bring him to office. It’s difficult to manage a wailing child, but my mother manages him inside the station when I have to go on the road. I am scared on getting Covid-19, but we have to do our duty,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bearing-the-loss-of-loved-ones-they-return-to-perform-duty/story-mr2DIXspxUHKzYNbUdprhK.html

06-05-2020||India||Eastern states tweak Covid-19 curfew hours to suit local requirements||A few states, especially those in the eastern parts of the country, are finding it unfeasible to apply the Centre’s latest directive to impose a curfew between 7pm and 7am daily. Many of them are, instead, opting to start functioning earlier in the morning for a very simple reason: the sun rises earlier in the east.In eastern and north-eastern states, many people go to work earlier than their counterparts in the western parts of India. In the north eastern states, people also wind up their work early, once again underlining the wide range of working conditions and styles in a country that stretches from 68°7’ to 97°25’ east longitude.The guideline issued by Union home ministry on May 1, announcing the second extension of the nationwide lockdown, had said, “The movement for individuals, for all non-essential activities, shall remain strictly prohibited between 7pm and 7am.”But states such as Odisha, Assam, Manipur and Nagaland have opted for a timetable that suits their local requirements. In Kohima, the sunrise is at 4.33am (Wednesday) whereas the sunrise in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, in the west, is only at 6.04am.Senior officials in Odisha said the chief secretary recently spoke to Rajeev Gauba, Modi government’s cabinet secretary, seeking a relaxation in curfew hours.“In an eastern state like Odisha, the sun rises before 5.30am and farmers are in the fields by then. Curfew till 7am would hurt the movement of people in rural areas as well as semi-urban areas. So, the chief secretary had suggested easing the curfew hours by two hours,” an official privy to the talks of chief secretary and cabinet secretary said.Among the north-eastern states that have changed their timings are Assam, Manipur and Nagaland. In Assam and Manipur, the curfew timings are from 6pm to 6am.Assam chief secretary Kumar Sanjay Krishna said the modifications in timings were necessary. “The MHA’s guidelines make way for state-specific modifications,” Krishna said.In Manipur, deputy chief minister Y Joykumar said, “Manipur is a green zone, and can afford to have a few relaxations.” Manipur’s two positive cases are now cured, and no new case has been reported. The curfew extends a bit longer in Nagaland -- from 5pm to 6am. Nagaland’s lone Covid-19 patient has been sent to Assam and is now cured.Officials in Meghalaya chief minister Conrad Sangma’s office said Meghalaya has decided to go with the MHA’s recommended curfew timings of 7pm to 7am.The curfew in Arunachal Pradesh is from 7pm to 5am, said an official in CM Pema Khandu’s office, as Itanagar has daybreak at around 4.30am. The state’s lone Covid case is now cured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/eastern-states-tweak-covid-19-curfew-hours-to-suit-local-requirements/story-eLOoTGjHw1ZbBIXzJauWzN.html
06-05-2020||India||IAS officer leads Covid-19 fight in Pune, major hotspot with 1,890 cases||“Why are you going to the office every day?” Pune’s additional municipal commissioner Rubal Agarwal’s seven-year-old son asked her soon after the national lockdown was first imposed on March 25. He was under the impression that only doctors and police officers had to report to duty, Agarwal, said. That evening, however, her son and her husband Prakher Agrawal, employed at an IT company, welcomed her home with a card and some homemade delicacies — clearly the father and son had had a heart-to-heart.An Indian Administrative Services officer of 2008 batch, Agarwal is responsible for bringing the Covid-19 pandemic under control in Pune, as she supervises the health department of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and is the chief executive officer of Pune Smart City Development Corporation Limited (PSCDCL).The PSCDCL is responsible for updating figures: Covid-19 positive patients, deaths and those recovered. It is also tasked with keeping track of the surveys conducted among the city residents, and communicating the results to the concerned agencies.With Pune being one of the prominent hotspots of the disease in the country — it has recorded 1890 cases till May 4 — the PMC’s staff of 15,000 is in the forefront of the city’s response. “All our 42 departments are working round-the-clock to provide back-up services apart from our medical teams, engineers and clerical staff,” said Agarwal.The PMC has established a Command Control War Room at the Smart City office. A lot of emphasis is placed on data crunching to trace and track areas where the coronavirus cases are emerging from, Agarwal said. “We are maximising our efforts in those areas from where the maximum number of positive cases are emerging and undertaking extensive surveys and testing. This is the reason why Pune started getting more positive patients,” she said.Agarwal’s day starts at 6 am, with surya namaskar. Even after she returns from in the evening, work continues till midnight. Agarwal, like several of her ilk, has been putting in at least 14 to 18 hours of work a day since the pandemic began to sweep through the country.With the health department falling under her charge, she regularly reviews the staff and the contact tracing efforts of positive patients, as well as taking care of quarantined people. “I am also required to visit hospitals dedicated to Covid-19,” said Agarwal, pointing out that as the number of positive cases was increasing in Pune, the number of quarantine facilities and isolation beds was being stepped up. Currently, Pune has 17,000 beds.Once out of the house, she uses masks and gloves and PPE (personal protective equipment) while visiting hospitals. Her biggest concern is staffing. If the numbers of positive patients increase, additional medical staff will be needed, Agarwal said. “From where should I bring them if the situation worsens?” she asked.“This is, undoubtedly, the most challenging situation in my career and life; but I am confident we will win this fight against Covid-19,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ias-officer-leads-covid-19-fight-in-pune-major-hot-spot-with-1-890-cases/story-e78PTrB7ff8yZlpQrkBtNP.html
06-05-2020||India||Coronavirus update- Railways, states to take call on migrants’ train fares: Supreme Court||The Supreme Court on Tuesday declined to intervene with steps taken by the Union and state governments to provide relief and transport to stranded migrant workers, while disposing of a plea seeking directions to the central government to ensure free travel for workers who wanted to return home.The petition, filed by Jagdeep Chhokar and Gaurav Jain, said that migrants were being asked to pay the fare for their journeys, and that they were unable to do so because of the financial burden imposed by the national lockdown to contain the spread of Covid-19.But a bench of justices Ashok Bhushan, Sanjay Kishan Kaul and BR Gavai, which heard the matter through video conferencing, disposed of the public interest litigation (PIL). “Insofar as charging of 15% of railway ticket amount from workers, it is not for this Court to issue any order regarding the same, it is the concerned state/Railways to take necessary steps under the relevant guidelines,” the bench said.The principal point raised by Chhokar was that migrant workers be allowed to travel to their home states during the lockdown, and the top court noted that an April 29 order of the Union government allowing the movement of stranded people satisfied this main prayer.“The substantial relief in the writ petition having been fulfilled we cannot expand the scope of the writ petition to consider other issues sought to be raised by the learned counsel for the petitioners during course of argument”, the court said.The Union government, through solicitor general Tushar Mehta, told the court that the central government, in consultation with the concerned state governments and Indian Railways, was taking necessary steps for the movement of stranded migrant workers.A fierce political war broke out over the issue of train fare for the migrant workers returning home on Monday, with the Congress declaring that the party and its state committees would pay the fare to enable workers to return and accusing the Centre of being insensitive to their plight.The Union government and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) responded by saying said that the railways was bearing 85% of the fare cost, and state governments had to pay 15%, thus allowing migrants to go back home free of cost. But the Opposition rebutted the assertion, citing government orders which asked state governments to collect fares from migrants and hand them over to railways.Several state governments on Monday said that they will pick pay for the tickets, with some even promising that any money collected so far from migrant workers will be returned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-update-railways-states-to-take-call-on-migrants-train-fares-supreme-court/story-kMF6YpJTaBCU9QDXSaX7YM.html
06-05-2020||India||Discrepancies in Bengal’s Covid-19 infection data, toll doubles in 5 days||West Bengal’s official Covid-19 death toll has doubled in five days to 68 after it adopted Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) protocols to record fatalities from the disease and scrapped the committee of doctors that, till April 30, audited these deaths.Confusion has surrounded West Bengal methodology of determining the numbers of deaths from Covid-19, with the state government initially reluctant to attribute the fatalities of patients with pre-existing conditions such as heart disease or diabetes to the infectious disease.On many days, the West Bengal government did not publish data of deaths and infections. It also recently revised the format of its health bulletin entirely. The government began to give data only for active cases and made no mention of the cumulative figure. This led to confusion over the number of total positives. Experts say that because of the unavailability of data for several days, health care workers have found it difficult to ascertain the pattern of the disease in the state.Bengal, which has now begun publishing cumulative data on infections, has also started taking into account co-morbid conditions such as heart disease, diabetes and other diseases.Between March 23 and April 30, the state attributed the deaths of only 33 people to the coronavirus disease, Covid-19, and that of 72 others, who tested positive for the virus, to co-morbidities.After it was criticised by the central government for doing this, and after doctors in the state recommended that it scrap the audit committee, the state government decided to follow rules set by ICMR, India’s apex medical research body and the nodal body for Covid-19 treatment and procedures in the country.Since May 1, 35 more deaths have been recorded due to the virus and none to co-morbidities. The state said it would not add the 72 previous deaths to its official fatality count. Bengal’s dashboard on Tuesday night was 1,344 cases (85 new), 68 deaths (seven in past 24 hours) and 264 recoveries.“During chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s meeting with doctors’ associations on April 28, we told her that the deaths needed to be declared as per World Health Organization (WHO)’s guidelines, using International Classification of Disease (ICD) 10 coding, in short, by mentioning Covid-19 in the death certificate of every one testing positive. She agreed to our suggestions, and sought 10 days’ time to fix all the errors that we pointed out. It’s good to see she has heeded our suggestions and things are changing for the better,” said Kaushik Chaki, secretary of the West Bengal Doctors’ Forum.On the 72 deaths not being included in the net count, Dr Rezaul Karim, who too had met with the CM on April 28, said, “Since the government has acknowledged its mistake and come clean with data, we should bury controversies and should focus on fighting the pandemic.”Responding to a query on audit committee, the state’s Chandrima Bhattacharya, junior minister for health, said, “ Dissecting comorbidity in deaths is an internationally recognised practice.”In the first week of April, chief minister Mamata Banerjee had appointed the audit committee. Bengal was seamlessly sharing data on Covid-19 till March 31, giving data on a 24-hour basis and also cumulative figures for deaths, people testing positive and recoveries. At the time, the state had suffered three deaths and 27 people tested positive.On April 1, when three more deaths were reported and 10 tested positive, the daily bulletin kept the total deaths at three and said that it was “subject to confirmation”.The state did not issue any bulletin for the next two days. From April 4, the bulletin’s format changed: it showed only active cases and mentioned only deaths that had been attributed to Covid-19 by expert committee.After the central team sought an explanation for this, on April 24, the state shared data of deaths due to “co-morbidity” among those who tested positive. The state came up with detailed data on May 4, following another letter from the central team, and said it had reported 214 fewer positive cases by April 30.Taking a dig at the Trinamool Congress government, Sujan Chakraborty, leader of the Left parties in the state assembly, said, “Kerala found innovative ways to fight Covid-19 and everyone can see the results. Bengal has found an innovative way to suppress data related to deaths and of people testing positive.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/discrepancies-in-bengal-s-covid-19-infection-data-toll-doubles-in-5-days/story-u5R0RywmifvR2ITXJPWVBL.html
06-05-2020||India||PM Modi reviews status of India’s Covid-19 vaccine development efforts||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday chaired a meeting of the task force on coronavirus vaccine development. PM Modi also took a detailed review of the current status of India’s steady efforts in vaccine development, drug discovery, diagnosis and testing.According to a statement released by the prime minister’s office, Indian vaccine companies have come across as innovators in early stage vaccine development research.The PMO has also noted contributions of Indian academia and start-ups pioneering the domain. Over 30 Indian vaccines are in different stages of vaccine development,with few going on to trial stages. PM felt that such coordination and speed should be embedded into a standard operating procedureIt was also observed that with linkage of laboratories all over the country, capacity for both — RT-PCR approach and for the antibody detection — have been enormously scaled up.“The problem of importing reagents for testing has been addressed by consortia of Indian start-ups and industry, meeting current requirements. The current thrust also holds promise for the development of a robust long-term industry in this area,” the statement read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-reviews-status-of-india-s-covid-19-vaccine-development-efforts/story-kALmnVolim3piB9Z06UkqJ.html
06-05-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||Late on Monday, the number of Covid-19 deaths around the world crossed 250,000. That’s a grim number, whichever way you look at it. On Tuesday, the global tally stood at over 252,000 dead, 3.66 million cases, and 1.2 million recoveries. Are more of the new cases asymptomatic? Data on worldometers.info would seem to suggest so – the proportion of mild cases (2.15 million) among active cases (2.2 million) has increased by a full percentage point from 97% to 98% over the past week. And out of 1.46 million closed cases, 83% (1.2 million) were recoveries, and the rest deaths. With 1.2 million cases, the US alone accounts for a third of Covid-19 cases; and with 70,000 deaths, almost 28% of all fatalities.India ended Monday with 46,388 cases and 1,494 deaths. The number of deaths from the coronavirus disease crossed 100 in a day for the first time. India may have somewhat flattened the curve, but it hasn’t defeated the virus yet – like New Zealand and Australia have, for instance.In both countries, the number of daily cases as well as daily deaths has come down. To be sure, as I have previously written, the number to watch is daily deaths. The number of daily cases can be misleading. This could be on account of complete confusion on reporting the numbers, perhaps driven by the desire to make things look better than they are (West Bengal is a case in point) (see page 9); or it could be on account of certain numbers not being aggregated (the private test numbers in Maharashtra weren’t, for instance, and were added to the total in one swoop on Monday, resulting in a spike in daily cases); or it could simply be because test results come in two, three, four, sometimes even five days later. The Delhi high court directed the Delhi government on Monday to ensure all reports came in within 48 hours of a test, but this applies only to Delhi. The number of deaths isn’t as misleading, although even that has seen some confusion arising from misreporting.As India exits the lockdown gradually – phase 3 of the nationwide lockdown is actually a graded exit – this will be the number to watch. In the US, for instance, the number of daily deaths and cases could rise sharply by June 1 as the country reopens, the New York Times reported Monday, citing internal Trump administration documents (see page 12). According to that report, the number of new cases in the US could touch 200,000 a day, and the number of deaths up to 3,000. The corresponding current numbers are 30,000 and 1,750, NYT reported.The trajectory of the disease in India, as this column has repeatedly pointed out, is very different from that in the US. Indeed, it could almost be called benign, if not for the inappropriateness of using such a term for a dangerous virus. Still, the scenario predicted in the US is important because it highlights that victory over the Sars-CoV-2 virus which causes Covid-19 requires persistence, and that there will not be one day of victory – unless you are New Zealand – but many: one when the number of daily cases starts reducing during a lockdown; another when the number of deaths do; still another when the number of daily cases starts reducing after a lockdown is removed; a fourth when a country successfully combats a second wave (and most experts are sure that there will be one); and a fifth and sixth and so on until a vaccine is discovered, and, more importantly, becomes accessible to all.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-4i3AqACwc7ehI8djSLTAyL.html
06-05-2020||India||Covid-19 update: After liquor tax, Delhi hikes petrol by Rs 1.67, diesel Rs 7.1 per litre||Retail prices of petrol and diesel in Delhi surged on Tuesday after the city-state’s government steeply increased value-added tax (VAT), seeking to raise additional money to offset falling revenues and fund the fight against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) , reducing the price gap between the two automobile fuels, state-run oil marketing companies (OMCs) said .Petrol’s price at the pump increased by Rs 1.67 per litre to Rs 71.26 and diesel’s cost rose Rs 7.10 to Rs 69.39, according to Indian Oil Corp., India’s largest OMC and refiner. Delhi’s Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) raised the VAT a day after lockdown restrictions were eased in the capital and elsewhere in India, allowing standalone stores to open, the self-employed like plumbers, electricians and domestic servants to return to work, and freer public movement, including the return of vehicular traffic. On Tuesday, the government imposed an additional tax of 70% on all varieties of liquor.As the residents of the capital reeled under the double whammy, Delhi’s deputy chief minister and finance minister Manish Sisodia tweeted: “Life isn’t all about rainbows and sunshine. Tough times need Tough solutions - my learning as Finance Minister.” The government almost doubled the levy on diesel to 30%, OMC executives said. The new VAT rate on petrol is also about 30%, they said. Earlier, Delhi used to levy a VAT 27% on petrol and 16.75% on diesel that attracted an additional Rs 250 per kilolitre air ambience charge, official data showed.Delhi is among the states that levies ad-valorem (Latin for “according to value”) duties on petrol and diesel to protect themselves against a steep fall in revenue because of a drop in international prices of crude or demand.Retail prices of the fuels fluctuate in tandem with international oil markets. If international prices jump, these states gain revenue proportionately, but they lose revenue when international oil rates fall. Revenues of states with ad-valorem duties on fuels have been hit badly as oil prices plummeted because of a demand slump resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown.The benchmark Brent crude price, that was around $50 per barrel two months ago, plummeted below $20 on April 21. It is currently hovering around $28 per barrel.The Union government levies a specific excise duty on the two fuels. On March 14, it mopped up an additional Rs 3 per litre from petrol and diesel each to fund Covid-19 relief measures, raising total central levies on petrol to Rs 22.98 per litre and on diesel to Rs 18.83 per litre. Despite the hikes in the central levies, the pump prices of petrol and diesel hadn’t been raised since mid-March because of the decline in crude prices.Since March 16, state-run oil companies have abandoned the practice of daily revision of the two auto fuel rates, making up for present and potential inventory losses. Pump prices of petrol and diesel are different in different states because of variations on sales tax or VAT rates and other local levies. States such as Tamil Nadu and Telengana have higher VAT rates, according to the oil ministry’s data-keeper Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC). Telangana charges 35.20% VAT on petrol and 27% on diesel. VAT rates in Tamil Nadu are 34% and 25% on petrol and diesel, respectively.The Delhi government’s announcement of a hike VAT on the two fuels came a day after it levied a special corona fee on the sale of alcohol. From Tuesday, an additional tax of 70% of the maximum retail price on all categories of liquor sold is being imposed in the capital.In an interview with Hindustan Times, deputy chief minister Sisodia had said losses being incurred by the Delhi government owing to the coronavirus lockdown had been “huge”.“In April last year, the collection was Rs 3,500 crore. This year, till April 30, we have collected only Rs 400 crore. So, factoring in an anticipated growth of 10%, we are losing around 90% on GST [goods and services tax] and sales tax etc. On top of that, there are losses in excise etc. The government cannot disburse salaries with just 10% of the usual revenue,” he said. The Congress party criticized the VAT hike. “Citizens seeking relief in the form of cash and tax cuts being meted out this treatment is a shame. Nowhere in the world would any government have inflicted such hardships on their citizens. We demand immediate rollback of this hike,” Congress leader Ajay Maken said.Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (Assocham) secretary general Deepak Sood said taxes were being raised at a time when demand should be stimulated with tax cuts.“If taxes are raised, demand would be further depressed, giving a jolt to the economy,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-update-after-liquor-tax-delhi-hikes-petrol-by-rs-1-67-diesel-rs-7-1-per-litre/story-QWZTUalAlBfcA6NwBCs8jO.html
06-05-2020||India||Covid-19 lockdown: Centre’s economic package may have small trader focus||The government is working on a relief package for small retailers, an official directly involved in drafting it said on condition of anonymity, adding that small retailers have been hit hard by the lockdown. Last month, trader body Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), representing more than 70 million small retailers, demanded bank loans at special interest rates, a government-backed insurance for traders and employees, and a wage protection plan or subsidy that will allow owners of kirana (Mom and Pop) stores to pay their workers.The government’s decision to allow the sale of non-essential products through standalone shops is widely seen as being aimed at small retailers.The government may also consider a revision in the scheme launched last year to provide pension to small traders. The pension plan was aimed to give old age protection and social security to retail traders, shopkeepers and self-employed persons whose annual income did not exceed Rs 1.5 crore.India’s small retailers run 12 million shops, employ 40 million people, and are responsible for an annual business Rs 700 billion, according to a report published by Assocham.“Small retailers need to continue to pay rentals and expenses like electricity, etc, while their stores have been shut in case they are not carrying essential goods or are operating at lower than 100% efficiency due to lack of goods from the companies reaching the retail points of sale. Hence, they are struggling to be viable businesses. At the same time, the tendency of the consumer to go digital and use e-commerce channels has increased due to safety concerns of Covid19 and this is beginning to cannibalise business from small retail too,” said Harsha Razdan, partner and head of consumer markets and internet business at KPMG India. Chandrajit Banerjee, director general, Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), too said: “The kirana stores need liquidity as they were not allowed to sell non-essentials and in many areas which were under complete lockdown these stores were not allowed to operate.” The government’s relief and fiscal stimulus plan has been in the making since late March, and it isn’t clear why it hasn’t been announced. Industry bodies have asked for a package of Rs 14-16 lakh crore to help offset the impact of the lockdown.The official cited in the first instance said that the government is also considering a package for oil marketing companies that have been hit hard by a fall in demand. In April, demand declined 70% as compared to a year ago , petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan said last week. Since then, there have been signs of a recovery in demand after the government allowed industries to operate, and relaxed restrictions on movement, but the official said this might not be enough to offset the losses of the companies. Also, with 84% of the Centre’s excise collection coming from oil sales, the government is very sensitive to the criticality of fuel sales, this person added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-lockdown-centre-s-economic-package-may-have-small-trader-focus/story-enK9g5ba2mdjmu2kCpvyFP.html
06-05-2020||India||64 flights will bring home 15,000 Indians in a week||India has launched a concerted repatriation programme, by sea and air, to bring back stranded citizens stuck in various parts of the world, but with a strict set of preconditions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), at a time when nations are trying to strike a balance between humanitarian considerations, responsibility towards citizens, and health concerns, in the face of a deadly pathogen.In the first week of a massive air operation, which will start on Thursday, 64 flights will bring 15,000 Indian citizens home from 12 countries. All those who travel back will have to pay for their tickets, undergo strict screening processes, download the Aarogya Setu app, and go into institutional quarantine after landing.The Indian Navy, on Tuesday, already kicked off one leg of the complex evacuation exercise by dispatching two amphibious warships to Male to evacuate Indians stranded in the Maldives, a spokesperson said. Two more warships may soon be dispatched to the Gulf , an officer familiar with the matter added. The overall plan involves key ministries of the government. Minister for state (independent charge) civil aviation Hardeep Puri outlined the air operation; the ministry of home affairs came out with a set of standard operating procedures that all passengers who avail the facility will have to abide by; and the ministry of external affairs coordinated with foreign governments as well as ministries and state governments within. The government has not termed it an “evacuation” but an exercise for the movement of Indian citizens stranded abroad. On March 22, India suspended all international flights. For 45 days, there has been no international passenger movement to and from India -- except international cargo flights and special flights arranged by foreign embassies, permitted by India. But this has also meant that hundreds of thousands of Indians — abroad for educational, professional, tourism or economic purposes, among other reasons — remain stuck. They have been demanding arrangements to get back home, but apprehensive that they may be carriers of the disease, the government had not done it so far. The first phase of bringing back Indian citizens by air runs from May 7 to May 13. The 12 countries involved in it will be United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Bangladesh, Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia, United Kingdom and United States, according to the flight plan for return of Indian nationals stranded abroad reviewed by HT. At a time when there has been a controversy over the train fares for migrant workers, the government clarified that international passengers will be charged for the journey. Some of the fares (one way) from cities in the Gulf countries such as Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Doha to Kochi, Kerala range from ₹15,000 to ₹16,000. Rescue flights from London to India will cost ₹50,000 while flights from the United States to India have been priced at ₹100,000. “If there was no charge, people wanting to come back would be much higher,” Puri said. He also emphasised that these are commercial services being carried out under “special circumstances”, and that the exchequer does not have the space to pay for repatriation of all stranded Indians abroad. Puri said that only Air India flights will be deployed in this phase — 40 from the national carrier and 24 from its subsidiary Air India Express. “We will consider involving private airlines as well going forward,” he added. According to Puri, the requests received by Indian embassies of Indians wishing to return are increasing by the day, and have now gone beyond the initial estimate of 200,000. “The numbers are quite significant…More than 300,000 people have registered in West Asia alone but we will only bring back those registered as compelling cases. The missions will determine the compelling cases,” said a person familiar with the decision. He added that if someone was living in another country and was comfortable, this was not the time to plan one’s return. The MHA SOP said that priority will be given to “asymptomatic” migrant labourers/workers abroad who have been laid off, short term visa holders faced with expiry (of visas), persons with medical emergency, pregnant women, the elderly, students, and those required to return to India due to the death of a family member. The SOP also adds that these flights will also be used to transport people in the other direction, from India to abroad. Foreign citizens of the destination countries, those who hold a visa of the concerned country of at least a year, green card holders, Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) card holders and in case of medical emergency or death in the family, Indian nationals with a valid six month visa can travel to the country. But this has a caveat; they will have to fulfil any conditions imposed by the destination country they intend to travel. They will travel on the non-scheduled commercial flights being arranged to bring back Indian citizens. And they too will have to bear the cost of travel and follow all health protocols. The Indian Navy, on Tuesday morning, dispatched two amphibious warships to Male to evacuate Indians stranded in the Maldives. Indian warships INS Jalashwa and INS Magar are currently on their way to the port of Male and are expected to bring back 1,000 people, a spokesperson said. Two more warships may soon be dispatched to West Asia for evacuating Indians, while a dozen more are on standby for undertaking any mission assigned to them, a person familiar with the planning in the navy said. Indian Air Force transport planes are also on standby for the evacuation but the IAF hasn’t been given any orders yet.External affairs minister S Jaishankar and foreign secretary Harsh Shringla are overseeing the process of coordinating with foreign governments, Indian missions and state governments. Jaishankar has been holding meetings with other ministries and had a video conference with heads of missions in some of the countries from which Indians are returning, including the UAE, Singapore, the Maldives and the US. At least 20 senior officials of the external affairs ministry have been selected to liaise with the states to which the Indian nationals will return. The foreign secretary will have a video conference with chief secretaries of several states on Wednesday for coordination.The external affairs ministry will upload all information on the people returning to the country on an online digital platform that will be accessible to other ministries and state governments. The data on those who lost their jobs will help state governments rehabilitate these workers by including them in national or state government employment programmes or in private sector jobs, a second person aware of the matter said. This person also insisted that the massive programme was not an evacuation because it is not a government-sponsored exercise. “What we are doing is facilitating the return of our nationals back to the country.” But all the planning has been accompanied with a recognition that India needs to be careful that the returnees do not end up spreading the disease, and possibly squandering away the benefits of the lockdown so far. According to the SOPs issued by the MHA, passengers will have to undergo screening process before taking off, and be allowed only if they are asymptomatic. They will also have to give an undertaking that they are taking the journey at their own risk apart providing personal and health data. In the aircraft, they are expected to abide by health protocols — by wearing masks and maintaining hygiene. Upon their arrival, they will once again undergo the screening process. Those found “symptomatic” after reaching India will be immediately taken to a medical facility, while others will have to undergo mandatory institutional quarantine of 14 days, for which they will have to pay. All passengers will have to download the Aarogya Setu app. The decision came as a major source of relief for many Indians abroad, as well as to their families back home. Swati Arora, a Gurugram-based homemaker, said her husband has been stranded in Kuala Lumpur since February, while she is also due to deliver a child by the end of May and has been requesting authorities for over a month for a way out. “My husband had gone for a work trip and his business visa, which was issued for 28 days, had expired. We have been constantly requesting the MEA and the embassy. We have also been tweeting about it tirelessly. I want my husband to be back in time for the delivery. The embassy has contacted him and a group of others stranded there informing that they will have to pay for their tickets and also quarantine facilities,” she added.(With inputs from Rahul Singh)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/64-flights-will-bring-home-15-000-indians-in-a-week/story-EOiwc8PM1F440Ior1A4fkI.html
06-05-2020||India||Over 5 million people internally displaced in India in 2019: UN report||More than five million people were internally displaced in India due to natural disasters, conflict and violence in 2019, constituting the highest number of new internal displacements in the world during the period followed by the Philippines, Bangladesh and China, according to a UN report.The ‘Lost at Home’ report, published by the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF), said that almost 33 million new displacements were recorded in 2019 – around 25 million were due to natural disasters and 8.5 million as consequence of conflict and violence.Of these, there were 12 million new displacements involving children, including around 3.8 million of them caused by conflict and violence, and 8.2 million due to disasters linked mostly to weather-related events.The report said that natural disasters resulted in more new displacements than conflict and violence. Almost 10 million new displacements in 2019 were recorded in East Asia and the Pacific (39 per cent) – and almost the same number in South Asia (9.5 million).“India, the Philippines, Bangladesh and China all suffered from natural disasters leading to displacement in the millions, which accounted for 69 per cent of global disaster-induced displacements. These were overwhelmingly caused by extreme conditions created by dangerous storms and floods,” the report said, adding that globally, around 8.2 million disaster-related displacements are estimated to have been related to children.In India, the total number of new internal displacements in 2019 stood at 5,037,000 - including 5,018,000 due to natural disasters and 19,000 because of conflict and violence. The Philippines accounted for 4.27 million new internal displacements due to natural disasters, conflict and violence, Bangladesh 4.08 million and China 4.03 million.The report added that today, more children than ever before are displaced within their own countries. At the end of 2019, an estimated total of 46 million people were internally displaced by conflict and violence. “About 19 million children were displaced within their own countries due to conflict and violence in 2019, more than in any other year, making them among the most vulnerable to the global spread of COVID-19,” the report said.The UN agency said the Covid-19 pandemic is only making a critical situation worse. “Forced out of their homes and communities, these children are among the most vulnerable in the world. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic stands to bring even more harm and uncertainty to their lives,” it said.Camps or informal settlements are often overcrowded, and lack adequate hygiene and health services. Physical distancing is often not possible, creating conditions that are highly conducive to the spread of the disease, the report said.“When new crises emerge, like the COVID-19 pandemic, these children are especially vulnerable,” said UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore. “It is essential that governments and humanitarian partners work together to keep them safe, healthy, learning and protected,” she said.The report looks at the risks internally displaced children face –- child labour, child marriage, trafficking among them -- and the actions urgently needed to protect them. It calls for strategic investments and a united effort by governments, civil society, companies, humanitarian actors and children themselves to address the child-specific drivers of displacement, in particular, violence, exploitation and abuse. It also calls on Governments convening under the High-Level Panel on Internal Displacement, established by Secretary-General António Guterres, to invest in actions that will provide protection and equitable access to services for all internally displaced children and their families.Better, timely and accessible data -- disaggregated by age and gender -- is also critical to delivering on this agenda, the report says. “Internally displaced children and youth themselves must have a seat at the table,” it said.The largest number of internally displaced children due to conflict are found in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) and sub-Saharan Africa. Internally displaced persons are concentrated in two regions — the Middle East and North Africa and West and Central Africa. The MENA region recorded over 12 million IDPs as a result of conflict and violence at the end of 2019. Almost all of them lived in just three countries — Syria, Yemen, and Iraq — and around 5 million were children.Sub-Saharan Africa is home to another 19 million IDPs due to conflict and violence. Around 4 out of 10 internally displaced persons lives in the region, half being children.One in four of all internally displaced persons due to conflict and violence in 2019 – 6.5 million people – were living in the Syrian Arab Republic alone. This includes 2.4 million children. Together with the Democratic Republic of the Congo (2.9 million) and Yemen (1.7 million), these three countries account for one in three (36 per cent) of all children internally displaced due to conflict and violence, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-5-million-people-internally-displaced-in-india-in-2019-un-report/story-CV4DXVtZFHDGIzbpTniQ7O.html

The guards posted at the site managed to get him out of the car, before it caught fire,” an ASI official said, asking not to be named. Police and fire brigade officials were alerted, and the man was taken for medical assistance.Deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Kumar Thakur said that the Mehrauli police received a call at 3.47 am on Monday. “The 31-year-old driver, Arun Chauhan from Mahipalpur, was driving his Hyundai Verna car under the influence of alcohol. He lost control of the vehicle and it crashed into the boundary wall. He was rescued on time and rushed to the hospital,” said DCP Thakur.A case of rash and negligent driving causing hurt, mischief causing damage to property was registered under relevant sections of Indian Penal Code and Motor Vehicle Act was registered against Chauhan, the DCP said.The ASI official quoted above said the police must be held responsible for letting the man travel at that hour despite their being a complete lockdown. According to police, he had a used cars business, making it unlikely that he was exempted from the lockdown as essential service workers are.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-crashes-car-into-qutub-minar-complex/story-PxEvv6DVONMwKNZwsNCWOJ.html
06-05-2020||India||3 Indian photojournalists from Jammu and Kashmir win Pulitzer Prize||Three Indian photojournalists based in Jammu & Kashmir won the 2020 Pulitzer Prize for feature photography for their coverage of the region during the clampdown that followed the Union government’s decision last August to divest the region of its special status and reorganise it into two Union Territories.The achievement of Dar Yasin, Mukhtar Khan and Channi Anand of the Associated Press (AP) in winning the most prestigious award in American journalism was acclaimed in J&K. Yasin and Khan are based in the Kashmir valley and Anand in Jammu. “It’s not the story of the people I am shooting only, but it’s my story,” Yasin told AP. “It’s a great honour to be in the list of Pulitzer winners and to share my story with the world.” Anand said the award left him speechless. “I was shocked and could not believe it,” he said.The Pulitzer Prizes -- established in 1917 through the will of publisher Joseph Pulitzer -- were announced virtually late on Monday due to the coronavirus disease outbreak.On August 5, Parliament revoked the special status granted to the state of Jammu & Kashmir under Article 370 of the Constitution, and passed provisions dividing the state into two Union Territories, J&K and Ladakh. The moves were accompanied by a clampdown in the region by the Union government, a communications blockade of the region, and the protective arrest of several politicians.The clampdown made it especially hard for journalists and photographers to work and get their reports and pictures through for publication by their organisations.AP says that the three photojournalists, snaking around roadblocks, sometimes took cover in strangers’ homes and hid cameras in vegetable bags. They captured images of protests, police and paramilitary action and daily life — and then headed to the airport to persuade travellers to carry the photo files in memory cards and flash drives and get them to the AP’s office in New Delhi. “It was always cat-and-mouse,” Yasin said. “It was very hard,” Khan told the agency, but “we managed to file pictures.”The Pulitzer Prize news led to the trio being swamped by congratulatory messages.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi wrote on Twitter: “Congratulations to Indian photojournalists Dar Yasin, Mukhtar Khan and Channi Anand for winning a Pulitzer Prize for their powerful images of life in Jammu & Kashmir. You make us all proud.”However, the award created a controversy with the citation referring to Kashmir, part of Indian Union Territory Jammu & Kashmir, as “contested territory”. Bharatiya Janata Party spokesperson took to Twitter to ask why the journalists accepted the award and whether Gandhi concurred with the citation. “It’s been a difficult year for journalists in Kashmir & that’s saying something considering the last 30 years haven’t exactly been easy. Congratulations to @daryasin, @muukhtark_khan & @channiap on this prestigious award. More power to your cameras,” former chief minister Omar Abdullah wrote on Twitter.The Kashmir Press Club said the award of the Pulitzer Prize to the photojournalists marked a reiteration that independent journalism and free press are more important than ever in these times, when journalists have been working in tough conditions.“This Pulitzer to the three photojournalists from J&K is an incredible honour and also a proud and big moment for all the media fraternity in J&K as the journalists in the region have always worked in toughest circumstances, risked their lives and always tried to deliver in a rational and objective manner,” it said.Journalists in the Valley called it a watershed moment. “A Pulitzer, probably for the first time awarded to Kashmiri photojournalists, is a huge honour and a watershed moment in the history of Kashmir. And a global recognition of the stellar work produced by Kashmir’s journalists, especially photojournalists, who go out there everyday despite all the risks, working in difficult conditions, documenting the ground realities, writing the first draft of history,” said senior journalist Majod Maqbool.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-indian-photojournalists-from-j-k-win-pulitzer/story-hN3xlFniHQ9jBH7hk2gUHK.html
06-05-2020||India||Former Jammu and Kashmir CM Mehbooba Mufti’s detention under PSA extended by 3 months||The detention of former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Mehbooba Mufti under the stringent Public Safety Act was on Tuesday extended by three months, hours before it was to expire. Likewise, the detention of former minister and senior National Conference general secretary Ali Mohammed Sagar, and senior PDP leader and uncle of Mufti, Sartaj Madani, was also extended by another three months, officials said.While Mufti is lodged at her official residence which has been converted into a subsidiary jail, Sagar and Madani are in a government accommodation at Gupkar Road.Former J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah questioned the move. “General Secretary of @JKNC_Sagar Sb has also had his PSA extended by a further 3 months. I’m struggling to get my head around the decision & the logic behind it because it smacks of vindictiveness & nothing else. New Delhi needed to make friends in J&K but is doing the opposite,” he tweeted.Srinagar mayor Junaid Mattu pointed out that these leaders had been under detention for the past nine months. “Anguished to hear the PSA detention of @MehboobaMufti Sahiba, Sagar Sahab and Sartaj Madni Sahab has been extended for another 3 months. They’ve already been in detention for 9 long months! My thoughts are with them and their families” Mattu tweeted.Mufti was detained on August 5 last year when the Centre abrogated special status of the erstwhile state and bifurcated it into two union territories -- Ladakh, and J&K. Later, her six-month preventive custody was extended by invoking PSA on February 5 this year. The PSA of Farooq Abdullah and his son Omar was revoked in March this year.Mufti’s daughter, Iltija, moved a habeas corpus petition in the Supreme Court, challenging her detention. The matter could not be taken up on March 18 due to coronavirus outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mufti-s-detention-under-psa-extended-by-3-months/story-RGi19aslJp5H71CGDEEPEP.html
06-05-2020||India||Congress offers to pay train fares for pilgrims, students; to set up help desks||A day after Congress president Sonia Gandhi asked all state units to pay the train fare of stranded migrant workers who are headed home, the party Tuesday extended the offer to students and pilgrims.Congress general secretary KC Venugopal, wrote to the party’s state units, on this. They were told to make sure such people aren’t required to pay the one-way fare if they cannot afford to do so.Pradesh Congress Committees will form advisory committees to frame guidelines and oversee implementation of the initiative, including outreach, identification and reimbursement of beneficiaries besides coordinating with officers appointed by state governments.Through another circular, Venugopal also directed the state units to establish help desks to enable the stranded migrant workers to approach them.The state units were also directed to deploy teams at each railway station to coordinate the departure of migrant workers and make payments to the railway authorities. In another move, the Congress sought voluntary contributions from the public to meet the travel expenses of migrant labourers.Gandhi’s announcement on Monday that her party would bear the cost of travel of migrant workers who, the Congress alleged were being forced to pay the train fare, triggered a war of words with the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which said the railways was paying 85% and states the remainder.Gandhi Tuesday called a meeting of the chief ministers of Congress-ruled states and senior leaders on Wednesday to discuss issues related to the pandemic and the economy.Meanwhile, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati said it was unfortunate that the Centre and the states were charging stranded migrant workers for ferrying them home and also offered to pay for their travel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-offers-to-pay-train-fares-for-pilgrims-students-to-set-up-help-desks/story-QeDc7c9V9B9eBLtofX3mCJ.html
06-05-2020||India||Delhi ITBP camp sealed as 23 more test Covid-19 positive||Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) suspect that a retired officer who died of Covid-19 had infected many other men as the number of infections in the unit where he stayed rose to 45 on Tuesday and forced it to seal the Tigri camp in Delhi, an ITBP officer said on condition of anonymity. It is also possible some of the men may have been caught the infection when they were posted outside the camp, the officer said. The decision to seal the camp was taken after 23 more men tested positive for Covid-19 on Tuesday. The camp houses the 22nd battalion of the ITBP; it has a strength of around 1,000 personnel who all are under observation and 76 are in quarantine.“We are trying to identify the source of infection in the force but preliminary assessment is that a retired ITBP officer, who was staying at Tigri camp and died due to Covid-19 on Sunday at Safdarjung Hospital could be the carrier,” the officer cited above said. “The retired officer had contracted Covid-19 infection sometime in mid-April but there were other comorbidity factors due to which he died,” the officer added. Retired officers are sometimes allowed to stay on in camps on compassionate grounds, including health. ITBP suspects that some personnel may also have contracted the infection while performing law and order duties in different parts of Delhi. Out of these, 43 personnel were deployed for performing internal security duties in the national capital and two with Delhi Police, ITBP said in a statement.ITBP reported its first Covid-19 case April 28. On Monday, the number reached 21 before it more than doubled to 45 on Tuesday; 43 of these were from the Tigri camp and the remaining two were stationed in Delhi’s Rohini.Central paramilitary forces, also called Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs), reported a total of 286 Covid-19 cases from across the country until Tuesday. The Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) reported the most number of cases, 158, of which 142 were posted at its 31st battalion in Mayur Viihar. The Border Security Force (BSF) has reported 67, the Central Industrial Security Force 15 and Sashastra Seema Bal 13.CRPF headquarters was sealed over the weekend and is likely to reopen on Wednesday while the BSF too sealed two floors at its headquarters after a driver tested positive.The spike in Covid-19 infections in CAPFs in the past one week has raised concerns among the top brass, which has ordered troopers to maintain the highest levels of personal hygiene and follow social distancing norms at work.ITBP has designated its largest Covid-19 hospital, in Noida, for troops from all paramilitary forces.“ITBP has started treating the Corona positive personnel at 200 bedded CAPF Referral Hospital based in Greater Noida. This Hospital is now dedicated to corona patients only. Personnel from all Central Armed Police Forces have also been admitted in this Hospital. Currently, 52 have been admitted from the ITBP and BSF (44 from ITBP and 8 from BSF) at the Referral Hospital,” the ITBP statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/itbp-seals-camp-as-infections-rise-to-45/story-JgDYkHESCJUvjkrwAmdvfI.html

On March 28, P K Singh, the resident commissioner at the Manipur Bhawan in New Delhi, was appointed as the nodal officer to help and guide the stranded citizens of the state.Many citizens from Manipur, mostly students, are stranded in various states amid the lockdown. On May 2, 92 stranded residents of the state were brought back from Guwahati and Mizoram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/manipur-notifies-operating-procedure-to-evacuate-stranded-residents/story-HYVCJhMnNc1WGYWMwNyC1K.html
06-05-2020||India||As migrants return, states to increase Covid-19 testing capacity||Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik on Tuesday ordered the health department to increase the state’s capacity to conduct Covid-19 tests by more than fourfold and Bihar decided to conduct pool testing of its returning workers as the two states reported an increase in the number of coronavirus cases.A majority of around 10 million migrant workers have either returned or would be heading back to Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, West Bengal, Jharkhand and Madhya Pradesh in the next few days. Patnaik on Tuesday directed health officials to increase the per-day Covid-19 testing capacity of Odisha to 15,000 from 3,500 now as more migrant workers tested positive after their return to Odisha. Until Tuesday evening, Odisha had reported 175 positive cases; at present, the state is testing 102 samples per 100,000 population compared to 240 per 100,000 in Andhra Pradesh. Still, its performance dwarfs that of West Bengal , which is testing just 25 persons per 100,000 population. Patnaik asked his officials to ramp up testing facilities in Baripada, Balasore, Koraput and Bolangir districts, from where the most number of new cases have been reported. A large number of the returning migrant workers would need to be tested to prevent the further spread of Covid-19 .On Tuesday, the Bihar government said migrants who returned accounted for 65 Covid cases, taking the total number to 535 across 32 of the state’s 38 districts. So far, four Covid related-deaths have been reported in Bihar. Only seven new cases were reported on Tuesday, tweeted Bihar’s principal secretary (health) Sanjay Kumar.“Going by our experience over the past 10 days, almost 60% to 70% of the tested samples, which came positive, were of people who came from outside the state,” Kumar said.Bihar health secretary Lokesh Kumar Singh on Tuesday said the 65 cases among migrant workers were spread across 21 districts of Bihar; he said the government had decided to conduct pool testing.Pooling of samples involves testing them in batches and when pooled sample tests positive, individual samples are assessed. This method reduces the number of test kits used, compared to testing individual samples. On Tuesday, officials said that close to 20,000 migrants and students had arrived in Bihar in special trains and many more were expected to reach in the next few days. The Bihar government has decided on a mandatory 21-day quarantine for the returnees. There were reports of 25 migrants workers running away from a government-run quarantine centre in Katihar district because the facilities were inadequate. “We are human beings and we can’t be held responsible for the spread of Covid-19,” said one of the migrants in the Katihar camp, demanding home quarantine.. Similar complaints were also reported from other districts.In Jharkhand, a large number of migrants who returned claimed that they had not received the Rs 1,000 promised by the state government and had to pay their own railway fare. Vikash Kumar Singh, 28, a worker in a hotel in Karnataka’s Devanahalli, borrowed Rs 900 to pay for his journey to Ranch. He said he had neither received the March salary from his employer nor the Rs 1,000 promised by the Jharkhand government to migrant workers stranded outside the state.“We slept on an empty stomach for several nights. Then I came to know that Jharkhand government is giving Rs 1,000 assistance through an app. I also registered myself with the Jharkhand chief minister’s special assistance scheme app. But I have not received any money till date,” Singh said.Director of information and public relations Rajiv Lochan Bakshi said, “The migrant workers who have registered themselves with the assistance scheme app by April 29 will receive the amount of Rs 1,000, whether they have returned to Jharkhand or still are stranded outside.” According to a government statement, around 306,000 people have registered themselves on the app..Returning migrant workers were greeted with flowers in Dankuni in West Bengal’s Hoogly district and Darbhanga in Bihar. Flower petals were showered on trains carrying the workers, who were received by political functionaries and government officials. In Darbhanga, top police and district administration officers were present at the railway station to welcome as many as 1,200 students from Rajasthan’s Kota, which is famous for coaching centres that prepare students for admission to engineering and other courses. A batch of 1,197 migrant workers from Thrissur in Kerala also returned on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-migrants-return-states-to-increase-testing-capacity/story-zRjT1JeFMSpE4wFJ8SYGTN.html

The international community is well aware of it and recognises that this is a propaganda exercise that they go through.”The person added, “The international community is also well aware of our position on this issue and I don’t think we need to really dignify this with any response.”In his speech, Alvi didn’t name India but referred to attempts to discriminate against and demonise Muslims in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic. Speaking before Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he also referred to Islamophobia, hate speech, the “scapegoating” of a community and denial of medical facilities to this community in Pakistan’s “immediate neighbourhood”.Alvi, a close aide of Prime Minister Imran Khan, also highlighted the condition of the Kashmiri people and said their sufferings were compounded by a communications blackout and lack of unfettered access to medical and other essential facilities and high speed internet. He also criticised what he said were efforts to change the demographic profile of the region.In his speech, Modi, without naming any country, said: “Even as the world fights Covid-19, some people are busy spreading other deadly viruses such as terrorism, fake news and doctored videos to divide communities and countries.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-terms-pak-efforts-to-raise-kashmir-at-nam-meet-propaganda/story-Dt1loBATMqu5sGAhgVNZBJ.html
06-05-2020||India||Hyderabad centre to grow SARS-CoV-2 in human cells for in vitro testing||The Hyderabad-based Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) will attempt to grow SARS-CoV-2 in human cell lines, enabling in vitro ( literally, in a test tube) testing of potential drugs and vaccines against Covid-19. Experts said this could expedite testing of new drugs that have not been tried on humans before.According to a statement from the Science and Technology ministry on Tuesday, CCMB will partner with cell therapy company, Eyestem Research Private Limited to develop these cell lines. The research team will use Eyestem’s human lung epithelial cell culture system provided as part of its anti-covid screening (ACS) platform to understand the molecular and pathological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2.“Culturing the virus outside the human host is a technological challenge that needs to be overcome. Eyestem’s cell culture system expresses the ACE2 receptor (an enzyme the Sars-Cov-2 virus uses to enter the body) and other genes that are key determinants of viral entry and replication. We hope that employing this system will allow the CCMB team to grow the virus predictably and thereby open up the potential for the drug screening and vaccine development strategies”, said Dr Rakesh Mishra, Director, CCMB.Before human trials new drugs should be tested in vitro and then in animals, said Dr Shobha Broor, former head of the department of virology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences. “For the re-purposed drugs being tried for Covid 19, there is some evidence in vitro because they have been tried for other viruses. For different viruses, different cell lines are need for testing efficacy. If we establish this system of testing Covid 19 drugs, whenever we have a new drug it can be tested quickly in the human lung epithelial cell line,” she added.In another statement, the ministry said Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (CSIR-IGIB) and Tata Sons have signed an agreement for licensing know-how for a paper strip based test named Feluda for rapid diagnosis of Covid 19.Dr Anurag Agrawal, Director-IGIB said the technology was conceived and developed at CSIR IGIB and utilizes an indigenously developed cutting edge CRISPR Cas9 technology to specifically recognize the Covid 19 sequence in a sample. A combination of CRISPR biology and paper-strip chemistry leads to a visible signal readout on a paper strip that can be rapidly assessed for establishing the presence of viral infection in a sample. The test is named after Satyajit Ray’s fictional detective Feluda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hyd-centre-to-grow-virus-in-human-cells-for-in-vitro-testing/story-v6iPciBwNg18N0pbMUEorJ.html
06-05-2020||India||Chittorgarh emerging as new Covid-19 hotspot in Rajasthan||Nimbaheda, a cement hub in Rajasthan’s Chittorgarh district, has emerged a hotspot of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) with 99 cases reported in just over a week. Like in Jaipur’s Ramganj, just one person has emerged the superspreader in the area, infecting 100 people including his wife and daughter.On Tuesday, 66 new Covid-19 cases were reported in the state, taking the total tally to 3127. Five more deaths were reported, taking the death toll to 82.Chief minister Ashok Gehlot has expressed concern over the rising number of cases and asked that the ruthless containment model of Bhilwara be replicated in Nimbaheda. Meanwhile, Chittorgarh MP CP Joshi from the Bharatiya Janata Party has written to union health minister Harsh Vardhan requesting that a special health team be deputed from AIIMS Delhi to Nimbaheda. Nimbaheda Principal Medical Officer Dr Mansoor Khan admits the administration was caught unawares since no cases had been reported for a month. “We were, in fact, readying for re-opening after the lockdown and were not prepared for this sudden spurt,” he said.He said the cases are being reported from three areas and all are either contacts of the first Covid-19 patient or those residing nearby. However, shortage of doctors and lack of resources has affected work of the health department, Khan said. Of the 90 posts of health staff at the sub-district hospital, only 41 are filled. One senior physician and four doctors who came in touch with the first positive patient have been quarantined, leading to a staff crunch. The health department has posted a senior physician from Udaipur to Nimbaheda.Till April 24, Nimbaheda did not have any Covid-19 case. On April 25, a 46-year-old gold trader was found positive. The man was being treated for cold and cough in a private hospital and had continued to meet people and also keep his shop open. He died on April 30 while undergoing treatment in the government hospital in Udaipur.After he tested positive, the street where he resided was placed under curfew and the town was sealed. Health authorities rushed to trace his contact history and a list of 300 people was prepared. All th positive cases are from that group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chittorgarh-emerging-as-new-hot-spot-in-raj/story-jdFzvvdlWec2PyWybcpENI.html
06-05-2020||India||Kerala HC refuses to stay govt ordinance on salary cut||The Kerala high court refused on Tuesday to stay an ordinance the government brought last week with an aim to make deductions in employees’ salaries as part of efforts to raise funds for fighting the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).The court agreed to the government’s contention that it has legislative powers to bring such an ordinance during an extraordinary situation and posted the matter for further hearing on June 4.Kerala brought the ordinance on April 30, a day after a single bench of the high court stayed the government’s decision to deduct salaries of employees for six days every month for the next five months (totalling 30 days).The move will be applicable to employees of all state-owned enterprises, public sector undertakings, quasi-government organisations and universities, among others.Hearing a bunch of petitions questioning the ordinance, the government said its move cannot be called a salary cut, and added that it was a deferment of payment in the time of a crisis. The state reiterated its contention that this amount will be paid once the fiscal condition of the state improved.“It is an extraordinary situation and the court cannot question the wisdom of the legislature in bringing out an ordinance...,” the high court observed.The government welcomed the decision. “We are happy. As the court pointed out, it is an extraordinary situation. Instead of a united move, some people are instigating employees,” said finance minister TM Thomas Iaasc.The state is expected to collect Rs 2,000 crore through this move. Employees’ organisations owing allegiance to the opposition parties said they will approach the Supreme Court soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-refuses-to-stay-govt-ordinance-on-salary-cut/story-vvXxR2f0dxGbqKbBW7xLiJ.html
06-05-2020||India||Yet to take a call on Covid-19 rapid test kits’ use, says Centre||India is yet to take a decision on the use of antibody based rapid testing kits (blood tests), said Lav Agarwal, joint secretary in the health ministry. The Indian Council of Medical Research told states to not use the RTKs it sent them after finding huge variations in the results. The kits were imported by it from China and arrived on April 16 after missing two deadlines. They were shipped out to states shortly after, but the apex medical research body told the states to suspend the use of kits on April 21. Following a field assessment, it said on April 27 that the kits were not to be used “The issue is being examined by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) currently, and they are yet to come up with a revised guideline on its use. As and when they are done, they will release the fresh advisory. However, rapid test kits have a limited use, the gold standard for infection detection continues to remain the polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test,” Agarwal said.To be sure, ICMR’s withdrawal of kits pertained only to the kits it was supplying the states. Some states are using RTKs sourced from Korea and do not seem to be having problems with them. India on Tuesday saw the highest jump in the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases and deaths in a single day, with 3,900 new positive cases and 195 deaths, taking the total number of infected people in the country to 46,433 and the death toll to 1,568, according to health ministry data as of Tuesday afternoon. The ministry’s data lags that in HT’s own dashboard which is based on the data at Covid19india.org, and the information released by state governments. According to HT’s dashboard, India’s tally as of Tuesday night was 49,379 cases and 1,613 deaths, with 2,991 cases and 119 deaths being added since Monday night. Agarwal attributed the sudden jump in cases and deaths to certain states not reporting figures on time.“There were some states that were not sending updating figures in time. So the sudden increase in numbers that you are seeing it is actually not the number of deaths or cases having gone up but the figures being updated. The gap is being addressed now,” he said.“Since we are dealing with a highly infectious disease here, timely reporting and management of cases is extremely crucial. Our case doubling rate has gone up from 3.4 days before lockdown to nearly 12 days now, and we are quite comfortable as far as surveillance and case management is concerned. However, this has to be maintained,” Agarwal added.The health ministry is also focusing on ensuring patients don’t face inconvenience in accessing non-covid related essential medical services. “It is a season of vector-borne disease such as dengue, chikungunya and other related diseases, so states have been asked to stay fully prepared for treating these patients also,’ he said. Apart from a directive on managing seasonal diseases, the health ministry has also issued guidelines on delivery of essential health services by states to critically ill patients suffering from chronic conditions and needing dialysis, chemotherapy, blood transfusion etc. in government and private non-covid facilities as per the relaxations given in various zones. “The states also have to ensure the routine programmes such as immunisation, TB, HIV/aids, anti-natal care etc. do not suffer. These are equally important,” said Agarwal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/yet-to-take-a-call-on-rapid-test-kits-use-says-centre/story-rUALOgCM70oJnTdrhYkcwI.html
06-05-2020||India||After 3 days, Kerala records fresh Covid-19 cases||Kerala reported three new coronavirus cases on Tuesday -- the first in the state in three days -- as it prepared to receive the first batch of expatriates from West Asia.Four special flights are expected to arrive in the state on Thursday and all returnees will have to undergo at least one week’s quarantine in care homes arranged for them, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said. “Many of them are coming without tests there. So we can’t take any risk at this point. It would have been ideal if they undergo tests before taking the flights,” he said.The Kerala government had been planning to send the returnees home after screening them and instructing them to stay in home quarantine for two weeks. But it dropped the plan after coming to know that most of them won’t be tested before they board the flights. Minister of state for external affairs V Muraleedharan on Tuesday contested Vijayan’s assertion that the Union government was flying back expatriates from West Asia without any tests being conducted on them.“I don’t know why he is indirectly blaming the Centre like this. On medical side, the standard operating procedure (SOP) is being prepared by the ICMR {Indian Council of Medical Research}. Its SOP came late in the evening and the CM ‘s version was based on some hearsay. We will bring back people only after tests,” he told HT.More than 400,000 people have registered themselves on a portal the state government launched last week for Keralites stranded in other countries, particularly in the Persian Gulf, who wish to return home. But the CM said the Centre had made it clear that such a massive evacuation was not possible at this juncture .The CM said all three new Covid-19 cases were from Wayanad in north Kerala; they contracted the virus from a Chennai-returned truck driver who tested positive two weeks ago. Kerala has 37 active coronavirus cases -- those who are under treatment. Of 33,800 samples sent for testing, 33, 265 returned negative.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-3-days-kerala-records-fresh-cases/story-pa841atjWK7MqRaHZAXAFJ.html

With the fresh cases, the state tally rose to 1,451 while it reported two fatalities taking the toll to 25.The Nanded pilgrims now account for 67 % (969) of the total 1,451 coronavirus cases detected so far in the state, a health official said. Officials said the death toll in the state rose to 25 after a 55-year-old Hoshiarpur man and a 22-year-old woman from Amritsar succumbed to the infection. So far, 133 patients have recovered from the disease, officials said.The maximum 48 fresh cases surfaced in Gurdaspur, followed by 47 in Tarn Taran and 34 in Fazilka, a medical bulletin said.Twenty-seven people were found infected with the virus in Faridkot; 22 in Sangrur; 15 in Muktsar; 14 in Ludhiana; six in Jalandhar; five in Kapurthala; and one in Patiala.Five Covid-19 patients—four from Patiala and one from Pathankot--were discharged from hospitals after recovery.Amritsar continued to top the coronavirus tally with 218 coronavirus cases in the state, followed by Jalandhar (134); Ludhiana (124); Mohali (95); Hoshiarpur (88); Patiala and Tarn Taran (87 each); SBS Nagar and Sangrur (85 each); Gurdaspur (84); Muktsar (64); Faridkot (45); Ferozepur (42); Fazilka (38); Bathinda (36); Moga (28); Pathankot (27); Barnala (19); Kapurthala (18); Mansa (17); Fatehgarh Sahib (16); and Rupnagar (14).

06-05-2020||India||Covid-19 won’t be able to damage Indian agriculture: Narendra S Tomar||Union agriculture & rural development minister Narendra Singh Tomar spoke to Saubhadra Chatterji and Zia Haq about the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the farm sector, labour shortage during the harvest season, benefits given to farmers and farm labourers, and allocations of jobs under the rural employment guarantee scheme. Edited excerpts:You have held a meeting with state rural and agricultural ministers. What are the main demands of the states?The Narendra Modi government’s priority is to protect farmers, rural India, and poor people from the pandemic. We have discussed issues related to farming operations and harvesting, agriculture market and mandi operations, procurement at MSP (minimum support price), provision of seeds and fertilizers, and logistics and movement of agriculture/horticulture produce. As you know, the Centre has given several exemptions to the rural and agricultural sector from the lockdown -- including all farming operations and mandis. This has definitely helped maintaining continuity in the supply chain especially in view the harvesting and sowing season. We are monitoring the situation closely.Farmers are still struggling with labour shortage. Moreover, social distancing and lack of transport have affected farm operations and procurement seems to be taking much longer.There is no denying that this is not a normal situation. But I can guarantee that the Covid pandemic will not be able to damage Indian agriculture. In some states, the stranded farm labourers have been engaged according to our reports and for those who have managed to return, they are working in their home states. I can assure you that farm labourers are getting full wages and are not forced to accept lower wages.Out of total wheat sown, almost 95% has already been harvested. Punjab has deployed 18,000 combines and Haryana has deployed 5,000 combines for harvesting and threshing. Harvesting of pulses is complete. For sugarcane, out of the total sown (acreage) 54.29 lakh hectares, harvesting has been completed all big states barring Uttar Pradesh, where it will continue till mid May 2020. Oilseed harvest is complete except of groundnut, which has been harvested to the tune of 85-90%. Summer crops have been sown in 57.07 lakh hectares this year against 41.31 lakh hectares last year.Farmers have dumped milk and horticulture produce because of inadequate price and markets. Are you planning additional compensations for this?This might have happened in some places due to critical situation occurred in the country in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. However, the government has taken several measures to provide timely benefits to the farmers. The Modi government has already transferred Rs 17,986 crore to farmers since March 24 under the PM-Kisan scheme. Instalment due for the period of April 1 to July 31 has been paid to 81.3 million beneficiaries. Under Kisan Credit Card, Nearly two million applications have been sanctioned since February 20 for a total amount of Rs 18,000 crores.Despite repeated advisories to states about freeing agriculture and allied activities, there are reports that farmers have been stopped from carrying out farm operations?Initially, it might have happened in some locations but now all field functionaries have been sensitised about the exemptions including agricultural operations. A positive impact has been observed in harvesting of Rabi (winter) crops, sowing of summer crops and continuity in supply chain and procurement of agricultural commodities.There is a surge in demand for MGNREGS jobs. How much money is the government ready to spend given its other financial burdens? This year, we have kept a provision of 2.8 billion persondays of work. We are aware that more people might need MGNREGS backup as millions of migrant labourers have returned home. In case the states anticipate more demand for work, it can be further scaled up.We have already approved Rs 33,300 crore of fund for the state out of which Rs 20,752 crore has already been released, liquidating all pending liabilities on wages and material. There is no pending bill on account of wages.On April 14, 1.42 million workers were offered jobs but this increased to 7.79 million (workers) within two weeks. More than 36 million person days of work has already been created under MGNREGS and it will increase further.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-won-t-be-able-to-damage-indian-agriculture-narendra-s-tomar/story-3FQxpETds30Fd24rhK4AaO.html
06-05-2020||India||JEE-Mains from July 18 to 23, NEET on July 26: HRD ministry||The CBSE Class X exams have been suspended for 2020 in the subjects where they have not been conducted, although students from North East Delhi, who missed exams that other students have already appeared in, will have to appear for these, HRD Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ announced on Tuesday when he interacted with students on their concerns. However, CBSE will conduct Class XII board exams in 12 subjects, with the schedule for these, and also the pending Class X exams being announced shortly. Officials say order CBSE to go ahead on evaluation of answer-sheets is expected soon.Students in North East Delhi missed some Class X exams on account of communal riots in the area. The engineering entrance examination JEE will be held from July 18-23, while the medical entrance test NEET will be conducted on July 26, the minister added. The two crucial exams, and also the Class X and Class XII exams were postponed due to the lockdown imposed to combat the spread of the coronavirus disease. “JEE-Mains will be held from July 18-23, while JEE-Advanced will be held in August. NEET will be conducted on July 26,” Nishank said in the online interaction.At least 1.5 million students across the country have registered for NEET this year, and at last 900,000 have registered for JEE Mains, the entrance exam for the country’s top engineering college.The JEE-Mains is also the qualifying exam for JEE-Advanced. The HRD Ministry’s National Testing Agency (NTA) has also given students an option to change their opted centres for the two tests as some of them may have moved back home during the lockdown.Universities and schools across the country have been closed since March 16. Responding to a question, the HRD minister clarified that the pending class 10 board examination will only be conducted for students in North East Delhi and not the rest of the country.“No examinations will be held for class 10 students nationwide except for students from North East Delhi. An adequate time of 10 days will be given to all students for preparation of exams,” Nishank said.“These exams will be conducted again for those few students who could not appear in these exams on the scheduled date due to the impact of law and order issues. The new schedule will be announced within two days,” he added.The HRD minister asserted that the government is planning to assess the academic loss of students during the lockdown period.“As a response to the COVID-19 lockdown, the CBSE will assess the loss of instructional time for proportionate reduction in curriculum load for 2021 board exams. In accordance, course committees of the board have initiated work on reduced syllabus in various scenarios,” he said.Regarding the travel of students, who are staying in hostels of Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas (JNV) to their homes, Nishank said the process has begun.“Out of 173 schools, more than 62 schools have initiated the process,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jee-neet-to-be-held-in-july-class-x-exams-fro-ne-delhi-hrd-ministry/story-1YmLRRvfhexLmCPVstec9L.html
06-05-2020||India||India needs big stimulus package, says Nobel laureate Abhijit Banerjee||New Delhi: India needs a big stimulus package, bigger than the one it announced in March to revive the economy which is hurting from the coronavirus disease and the lockdown enforced to combat it , Nobel laureate Abhijit Banerjee said on Tuesday , adding that the emphasis should be on generating demand. One way to do this would be to just put money in the hands of consumers, he added. Banerjee, 59, who shared the 2019 Nobel prize for economics with his wife Esther Duflo and Michael Kremer for an “experimental approach to alleviating global poverty,” cited the examples of countries that have unveiled sizeable stimulus packages to boost their economies.“That’s the reason a lot of us have been saying that we need a stimulus package,” Banerjee said in a video conversation with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi. “That’s what the US is doing, Japan is doing, Europe is doing. We really haven’t decided on a large enough stimulus package. We are still talking about 1% of GDP [gross domestic product]. The United States has gone for 10% of GDP.” On March 26, the National Democratic Alliance government announced a Rs 1.7 lakh crore relief package under the Prime Minister Garib Kalyan Yojana (PMGKY), which is around 0.8% of India’s GDP, to ease economic distress and make sure food and cash reach the poor. Industrial houses are waiting for a bigger package of about Rs.16 lakh crore to stimulate demand and resuscitate economic growth, which the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has predicted will decelerate to 1.9% this fiscal year, the slowest pace in three decades.In his conversation with Gandhi, Banerjee said that the government should go beyond a moratorium on debt payments which the Reserve Bank of India announced last month; it could consider cancelling payments in this quarter and take care of them itself for small enterprises. But an economic revival also needs more than that, he said, adding that money should be put in the hands of the people to generate demand, say Rs 10,000 each. “It is not clear that targeting the MSME sector is the right channel. It is more [about] reviving demand,” he said, adding that delivering money straight to consumers to spend would achieve the objective.The conversation is the second in a series that Gandhi is holding with global thought leaders and experts on the impact of Covid-19 on the economy and possible solutions. The first was with former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan on Thursday.Banerjee told Gandhi that it is important to revive demand without obsessing about targeting the right beneficiaries. “Nothing bad will happen if we give money to the bottom 60%. But to give direct cash transfer to only poorer people is debatable,” he said.Rajan told Gandhi on April 30 that the government should transfer cash directly to the poor and supply food through the public distribution system (PDS) to as many people as possible to help them tide over the impact of the coronavirus disease. He had estimated that the effort would cost the exchequer Rs 65,000 crore..Banerjee said the government must ensure social security for all in need, either by allowing portability of ration cards, or simply the use of the Aadhaar number irrespective of one’s location, or even temporary ration cards, an idea he suggested in an Op-Ed he wrote with Raghuram Rajan and Amartya Sen. “Anybody who wants one, get a temporary ration card -- lasts for three months for now and maybe renewed for another three months, if necessary..,” he said.“I think we have enough stock (of food). I think we can keep going for a while. The rabi {winter-sown} crop has been good this time, so we are going to have tonnes of wheat and rice. So at least wheat and rice, we can keep giving out. I don’t know if we have enough dal [pulses] or not. But I think the government promised dal as well. So hopefully we have enough dal and cooking oil etc,” he said.On lifting the lockdown, extended until May 17, Banerjee called for caution. “You can’t take out the lockdown when a lot of people are getting sick. We need to be aware of the disease’s path before taking a decision on lifting the lockdown,” he added.Banerjee also suggested that the Centre give state governments money to chalk out their own initiatives to reach a wider section of the people and not think about some of the money getting wasted.“Be brave and take risks. When you are in dire straits, being brave is the only option,” he said. Indonesia, Banerjee pointed out is giving out “cash transfers through a community decision making process. The community will decid who are the people who are needy.” This doesn’t do any worse than “centralised tragetting,” Banerjee added. Gandhi also pointed out that there is a feeling that “strong leaders can take on the virus...; that it requires one man to charge in...” . Banerjee said that this has been “disastrous” and pointed to Brazil and the US. “These are two strongmen behaving like... pretending like they understand anything... but even what they say every day is kind of laughable. If anyone wanted to believe in the strongman theory, this is the time to disabuse themselves,” he said.A spokesperson of the finance ministry declined to comment on the issue. Meanwhile, G Kishan Reddy, minister of state for home, said in a tweet, “Nobel laureate Abhijit Banerjee enlightens the Congress & it’s pseudo intellectual leaders, including Mr @RahulGandhi, by supporting #PMGKY, PMJDY [Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana] among others & the efforts of Hon PM @narendramodi ji.”Sunil Deodhar, national secretary, BJP and Incharge of Tripura said in a tweet: “General public in India is so smart that they sensed well in time what #AbhijitBanerjee said today and made @narendramodi ji & @BJP4India victorious twice with thumping majority.”“So after heavily edited conversation with #RaghuramRajan few days back, today #AbhijitBanerjee makes this “strategic” leadership of @INCIndia fall flat on his face,” he said in another tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-needs-big-stimulus-package-says-banerjee/story-7prqtBHRDZNsA6XrywZ56L.html
06-05-2020||India||Day 2 liquor sale: Long queues, higher taxes, doubts over home delivery||Increased excise duty on alcohol, heavier deployment of police personnel to enforce social distancing, long queues and speculation over home delivery of liquor in some states marked the second day of liquor sales across the country after curbs on sale of alcohol was lifted after 42 days on May 4. Till Tuesday evening, four states – Delhi, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal and Rajasthan -- had announced an increase in the excise duty for liquor. Delhi increased the tax by 70%, Andhra by 75%, West Bengal by 30% and Rajasthan by 10%, all to raise funds to fight the pandemics and manage state finances, the governments said. To reduce chaos at liquor vends, the Chhattisgarh government set up a new company, Chhattisgarh State Marketing Corporation Limited, to deliver liquor at home in green zones, a government statement said.“A customer can order up to 5,000 ml of liquor at a time for home delivery and the delivery charge will be Rs 120,” the release stated. Except Raipur and Korba districts, the remaining 26 districts of the state are green zones.West Bengal also allowed online sale and home delivery from retail outlets to restrict footfall at the shops, officials said. How did it facilitate online delivery?Will delivery men from stores come home? “We welcome the government’s decision,” said Dilip Pal, a shopkeeper from the Sealdah market in Kolkata. Punjab is likely to take a call on a similar proposal at a Cabinet meeting on Thursday. “For allowing home delivery of liquor, we need to make changes in the excise policy.For that, Cabinet’s approval is needed,” said a Punjab government official. Others states have brought in changes in excise policy through a Cabinet decisions. In Punjab, the proposal to is deliver liquor at home from local vends.In the excise policy for current financial year, the Punjab government had approved a pilot project for home delivery of liquor in Mohali. However, the proposal could not be implemented as curfew was imposed all across Punjab from March 22 to contain the outbreak of Covid-19. Some states, such as Assam and Andhra Pradesh recorded high sales on first few days. Assam, where liquor shops opened from Saturday, earned between Rs 75 crore to Rs 80 crore in the first three days, officials said. Assam earns on an average earns Rs 65 crore per month from liquor sales. “On the first day (Monday), Andhra Pradesh earned around Rs 68 crore through liquor sales,” said a state government official. On the second day, Tuesday, higher revenue is expected as the price of liquor has increased and shops will open for an extra hour, the official said. In Karnataka, the estimated excise revenue on Tuesday was Rs 197 crore as compared to Rs 45 crore earned on Monday. The average for a day in 2018-19 was Rs 54 crore, official estimates showed. Some states, such as West Bengal and Karnataka, issued orders to limit the sale of liquor bottles. In both the states, a person is entitled to buy only two bottles of distilled spirits and six bottles of beer. In Karnataka, where a similar order was issued on Monday morning, action was taken against a vend owner who sold more than the prescribed bottles to a customer, who put out his Rs 52,000 liquor bill on social media. To enforce social distancing norms, local administrations deployed additional police personnel at liquor vends and, in some places, such as Mumbai, bouncers were hired to prevent unruly behaviour and jostling among customers. However, in some places in Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh, police had to use mild force to disperse the crowds. UP’s excise secretary, Sanjay Bhoosreddy, said the sale of liquor has been smooth and the government expects the revenue to increase in the coming days. In Andhra Pradesh, where liquor is 75% costlier than it was in the pre-lockdown period, people scrambled to buy alcohol despite the price hike even as women in Nellore and Visakhapatnam districts protests at opening of the shops.At Yetapaka village of East Godavari district, people queued up in front of wine shops from 9 am, though the shops are supposed to be open for business from 11 am. In Guntur, the staff issued tokens to the people in queue. Out of 3,468 retail outlets, only around 500, located in red zones and containment areas of orange districts and in malls, remained closed.“The steep hike in liquor prices is to discourage the consumption of alcohol and number of shops would also be slashed by month end,” the official release said, adding that the number of shops may be reduced by 15% by the end of May.Officials said there was huge rush at liquor vends in districts bordering Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Telangana, which are yet to resume the sales. Police on Monday had to carry out a mild lathi-charge to shoo away more than 2000 people who crossed over into Karnataka through porous borders to purchase liquor.In Rajasthan, where excise duty was increased by 10% to shore up money to combat Covid-19, shops opened late as police tried to control unruly crowds. In some places in Jaipur, buyers carried chalk to make marks to maintain social distancing. There were also complaints of overcharging from Jaipur and Chandigarh.Unlike in the rest of India, liquor sales in Goa were devoid of incident because of the state’s high number of liquor dealers per capita. Goa has around 3,000 liquor retailers and 11,000 licensed liquor vendors, a bulk of whom are serving liquor through a bar or restaurant and cannot currently reopen. “Many of our loyal regular customers have visited us to restock on their supplies. There wasn’t any rush as such,” Dattaprasad Naik, the president of the Goa Liquor Traders Association, said.While Kerala decided not to open liquor shops till May 17, the shops will open in Madhya Pradesh on Wednesday and in Punjab on Thursday. Tamil Nadu also announced that liquor vends will not open in Chennai till further notice while allowing liquor sale in the rest of the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/day-2-liqour-sale-long-queues-higher-taxes-doubts-over-home-delivery/story-hYjR6nTUQxOb6a8L81wGdJ.html

All the 25 people who have tested positive for the deadly virus are from the hospital’s oncology ward, said one of the officers. The people who have tested positive include serving personnel, ex-servicemen and a few of their dependents. No health care professional has tested positive for Covid-19 yet, the second officer said adding that necessary protocol is being followed including contact tracing of the infected people.“After someone tests positive, detailed contact tracing is carried out. The contacts are then placed in high or low risk groups. Quarantine protocol and testing of those in high risk group is carried out. All this can take up to 48 hours,” he added.The positive cases have been moved to the army’s Base Hospital in Delhi Cantt, which is dedicated to Covid-19 patients, said the second official. The people who have tested positive for the coronavirus are serving and retired personnel and a few of their dependents.No health care worker has tested positive for Covid-19 yet, the second official said, adding that necessary protocol is being followed including contact tracing of the infected people.The navy accounts for the single largest case of Indian military personnel being infected with the novel coronavirus, with 26 sailors from a key naval base testing positive for Covid-19 last month. The sailors were from INS Angre --- a logistics and administrative support base under the Western Naval Command. All the cases were traced to a single sailor who tested positive for the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/25-test-positive-in-delhi-s-army-hospital/story-9E2dHV22PW4dcLT0Cda5fM.html
06-05-2020||India||Delhi’s Covid-19 tally crosses 5,000 after 206 new infections||Delhi reported another big jump of 206 cases on Tuesday, with the total infections doubling to 5,104 in 11 days, even as the national capital ramped up testing amid concerns of a surge in the number of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases nudged by a graded exit from the ongoing lockdown.About 1,500 cases have been added to the Delhi tally in the last five days. The Capital accounts for 10.3% of the total cases in the country, with chief minister Arvind Kejriwal saying recently that his government was prepared to tackle a spike in infections.After the first three Covid-19 cases were reported in India in January and were contained, a second wave of infections emerged on March 2, as Delhi and Telangana reported one case each. A 45-year-old man who returned from Italy to his house in Mayur Vihar was the first reported infection in the Capital. Since then, it took more than a month for Delhi to record its first 1,000 cases till April 11. The numbers in early April were driven up largely by those evacuated from a religious gathering at Nizamuddin.After the emergence of the cluster – 16,500 people who attended the gathering have so far been identified – it took only eight days for Delhi to add another 1,000 cases to its tally. The last 2,000 cases in Delhi have been reported in just eight days, with the highest number of infections – 427 in a day – being recorded on Sunday. The previous highest single-day tally was on Saturday, with 384 cases.“Delhi saw the first spike in cases in early April after over 2,300 people from Nizamuddin Markaz were evacuated in March-end. Many of them tested positive subsequently, driving up the numbers. However, once the cases from Markaz and those who had come in contact with them came down, many of the new cases were being reported in health care workers and their families,” a district health official said on condition of anonymity.Several clusters of infections have been reported from hospitals. At the Babu Jagjivan Ram Memorial Hospital in Jahangirpuri, 75 health care workers have so far tested positive. At the state government-run Baba Saheb Ambedkar hospital, at least 45 people have been confirmed of having contracted the disease. The first cluster of infections from a hospital, however, was reported at the Delhi State Cancer Institute in the first week of April – 26 health care workers, four cancer patients and a two-year-old child were among those who tested positive.An official from Delhi’s health department, who asked not to be named, said: “Now, the concern is with the government relaxing the lockdown norms. More and more people will go out and be exposed to the infection. There will be a spike in cases around two weeks from now.”Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Sunday that a complete lockdown has affected the economy and livelihoods, and that relaxations were important to ensure life is not completely thrown out of gear. He said that people will have to learn how to live with the disease in their midst and that the Delhi government was prepared to tackle the surge in cases.When the first Covid-19 case was reported in Delhi in March, there was only one sample collection centre, located at Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, and the tests were being conducted by the National Institute of Virology in Pune. On Tuesday, 3,744 samples were collected at about 42 centres and tested at 24 centres in the city.“It is possible that we are detecting more cases now that we are testing more. Earlier, only those who were symptomatic were being tested. However, now we know that around 80% people either have no symptoms or very mild symptoms. So we might have missed many cases who have now spread the infection in the community,” said another district official, asking not to be named.“Now, most people from the community – many without any symptoms – are being tested positive. This could be the second generation of transmission from the travellers that we might have missed and soon we will see the third generation of transmission, with the relaxation in norms,” said the district official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/capital-adds-1-500-cases-over-five-days/story-RFtmGJyZf48EKvHQlzoppK.html

Subsequently, the lab was also shut down. This is the first such instance in the state in which a laboratory has been found to be testing swab samples illegally without any authorisation from the Indian Council of Medical Research.“The state health department had initiated an enquiry after receiving a complaint against the laboratory. The laboratory was sealed,” said a top official of the state health department.An FIR was registered at the Phool Bagan police station. “This is a dangerous practice as there could be chances of leakage while conducting the tests if proper precautions are not taken, resulting in further spread of the disease. A lab is given permission by the ICMR only if it has proper infrastructure to handle such samples,” said a senior doctor from one of the government-run laboratories.At present, West Bengal has 11 government laboratories and six private laboratories approved by the ICMR where swab samples for Covid–19 are tested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dangerous-private-lab-in-kolkata-conducts-covid-19-tests-fir-filed/story-PUnRxWfEHx5fjzSAGcJ0XP.html
06-05-2020||India||Covid-19 deaths in Bengal double in 5 days as govt junks casualty audit panel||West Bengal’s ‘official’ coronavirus death toll has doubled in the five days since the state virtually shelved its Covid-19 death audit committee in the face of a raging controversy.While the state attributed 33 deaths to Covid-19 between March 23 and April 30, another 35 deaths were reported in the last five days. This steep rise in the death toll is largely because the state, between April 1 and April 30, attributed 72 deaths to comorbidity, a practice that stopped on April 30. Since May 1, the state has not attributed a single death to ‘comorbidity’. However, on Tuesday it maintained that the death toll stood at 68. This meant, even though the state was no longer attributing deaths to comorbidity, it would not include those already attributed to comorbidity, into its official death toll. Taking all deaths into account, Bengal’s Covid-19 death toll stood at 140 on May 5, with a total of 1,344 persons testing positive, including seven dying and 85 testing positive in the last 24 hours.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage.“During chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s meeting with doctors’ associations on April 28, we told her that the deaths needed to be declared as per World Health Organisation (WHO)’s guidelines, using International Classification of Disease (ICD) 10 coding, in short, by mentioning Covid-19 in the death certificate of every one testing positive. She had agreed to our suggestions, and sought 10 days’ time from us to fix all the errors that we had pointed out. It’s good to see she has heeded our suggestions and things are changing for the better,” said Kaushik Chaki, secretary of the West Bengal Doctors’ Forum.Asked if the state now considered the introduction of death audits a mistake, Chandrima Bhattacharya, junior minister for health, said, “Why should it be a mistake? Dissecting comorbidity in deaths is an internationally recognised practice.”Figures related to the deaths of Covid-19 patients went totally awry in the state since the beginning of April, when CM Banerjee appointed a committee of doctors to find out which patient died of coronavirus infection and which of co-morbid conditions. Bengal was seamlessly sharing data on Covid-19 till March 31, when the state put the death toll at 3 and the cumulative number of persons testing positive at 27. Till then, the state gave data for past 24 hours and also cumulative figures for deaths, persons testing positive and recoveries.The first change happened on April 1, when 3 more persons died and 10 tested positive. The health department’s daily bulletin left the cumulative death figure at 3 and said that the declaration of the latest 3 deaths was “subject to confirmation”. The state did not issue any bulletin for the next two days and, from April 4, the bulletin’s format changed, with the state sharing data only for active Covid-19 cases instead of the cumulative numbers and mentioning only those deaths that had been attributed to Covid-19 by the expert committee.The first time the state came up with data on the deaths attributed to co-morbidity was on April 24, two days after an inter-ministerial central team sought Bengal’s explanation on the rationale behind its Covid-19 death declarations. Chief secretary Rajiva Sinha, on April 24, attributed 18 deaths to coronavirus infection and 39 to co-morbidity. On April 30, Sinha attributed 33 deaths to Covid-19 and 72 to ‘comorbidity’.After the state came up with detailed data on May 4, following another letter from the inter-ministerial central team, it also became clear that the state had reported 214 fewer cases of persons testing positive by April 30.Taking a dig at the ruling Trinamool Congress government, Sujan Chakraborty, the leader of the Left parties in the state Assembly, said, “Kerala found out innovative ways to fight Covid-19 and everyone can see the results. Bengal, unfortunately, has found an innovative way to suppress data related to deaths and of people testing positive.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-deaths-in-bengal-double-in-5-days-as-govt-junks-casualty-audit-panel/story-RFvtl7g3WPf4SGRbdOQbQM.html
06-05-2020||India||Second economic stimulus package likely soon: CEA||The second economic stimulus package can be expected “very soon”, Chief Economic Adviser Krishnamurthy V Subramanian said in an interview on Saturday, although he declined to put a time-frame or a magnitude to it.Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with home minister Amit Shah and finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday in the context of a stimulus package and an official familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity that in a series of meetings on this theme the Prime Minister has, over the past few days reviewed trade, commerce, coal and mining, defence, aviation, power, agriculture, and the education sectors.The PM chaired a meet on strengthening the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME). “Chaired a meeting on strengthening our MSME sector, which plays a pivotal role in economic development,” he tweeted. He discussed interventions in the financial sector and structural reforms needed to spur growth. At the meeting with the finance minister and other officials, he also discussed strategies and interventions to support MSMEs and farmers, enhance liquidity and strengthen credit flows. The PM discussed ways to ensure financial stability and measures taken to enable businesses to recover quickly.  Watch | ‘Was the government blindsided on migrants’: CEA answers | On The RecordCoronavirus outbreak: Full coverageThe focus of the package, when it is announced, will be making the Indian economy self-reliant and turning the current crisis into an opportunity, a second person familiar with the matter said, asking not to be identified.The ongoing coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic and the lockdown enforced to slow its progress have roiled the economy. On Friday, the government announced a graded exit from the lockdown over two weeks starting May 4. However, in so-called red zones, the most affected or most at-risk parts of the country, many of the restrictions will continue. The IMF has said India will grow by 1.9% this calendar year.“We have to keep in mind, this is not something that is specific to India, but a global pandemic. This is an extremely uncertain period, so any projection we make will have to be continually recalibrated as things evolve.IMF has said India will grow at 1.9% when the global economy is going to shrink at 3%... They put in several caveats as they should. Even with the Spanish Flu, there was a V-shaped growth after. With that in mind, overall, I would say between 1-2% of GDP is something I would think,” Subramanian said.Meanwhile, the government has already received specific proposals of policy reforms and fiscal incentives from various stakeholders and industries but a final decision will be taken after careful assessment of various sectors of the economy, the two officials cited above said. Industry has proposed a comprehensive stimulus package worth Rs 16 lakh crore, which includes welfare measures, policy reforms and fiscal concessions, to revive the economy. The government has come in for criticism over the delay in announcing a stimulus package.Subramanian said that the delay was because of the government’s desire to come up with a “comprehensive” one. “Primarily, the work is on trying to make it very comprehensive. Not just in terms of the stimulus, but bringing in some reform measures as well. Policy-making is also about balancing different interests. Do recognise that during the period of the lockdown, economic activity has remained down.”The primary focus was containing the spread of the pandemic, and providing relief to the poor, the two officials said. Now, the next big agenda of the government is to bring the economy back on track.“A stimulus is expected sooner than later and it is a work in progress. But, it will neither be the first stimulus, nor the last. The government will provide relief to every sector in a caliberated manner so that the limited resource can be utilised most effectively. The immediate focus would be on rural economy, informal sector, MSMEs (micro, small and medium enterprises) and those big industries that would have rippling impact on the three. Public money will be spent in a measured way so that maximum desired results for the entire economy are ensured,” the first official said.Subramanian, however, did not put a number to the possible package. However, he added that reports of a stimulus as much as 10% of the GDP in the US and 15% in the UK are exaggerated. “Take the UK, which has a 350-billion pound guarantee programme. Now entire cost of that is not 350-billion pounds but a fraction of that — possibly 35 billion. So the number that is floating around of 15% of GDP, isn’t accurate — actual number is 3.7% of GDP. Similarly, the US number is 6.7% of the GDP and not 10%. That’s something we have done carefully, we’ve looked at each of those numbers.”He also said that India can’t compare itself to the US . “40-50% of the US population pays taxes while in contrast the number in India is less than 10%. We cannot cherry-pick some of these aspects, there are significant differences that you have to keep in mind,’’ he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2nd-economic-stimulus-package-likely-soon-cea/story-CxJz153qKFAs215Fx0Y9kN.html

With panic, desperation and gloom all around, there is certainly no time for niceties, one would think. With so many going hungry, corona warriors are focusing on providing basic ration to as many as possible. Gurpreet Wassi, a Delhi-based entrepreneur who has been carrying out relief mission across the city one day that she needed to do something additional, at least for the kids. As hungry children hurriedly gathered to take their share of food, she thought that mere roti or khichdi won’t do, something sweet can bring a smile on their faces. “I wrote a post on my Facebook if anyone could help me with muffins, as it is very tough to arrange for such items these days. Luckily, two companies came ahead to support me. They prepare fruit buns that can be eaten alone. Along with that, a bakery also agreed to make muffins for the children.”Wassi says there’s always joy in the eyes of the children as they receive these treats. “I have also seen children eat muffins with chapattis happily… these are bizarre times, and it’s nice to see them relish it with so much love,” says Wassi.Vineet, an 11th standard student in the rural area of Tauru, Mewat is also distributing cakes to the kids living in JJ colonies, along with rashan. “Kids love anything sweet and because of the lockdown, they haven’t eaten chocolates or candies for weeks. So I thought of giving them cakes along with dry ration that we put together for their families. The sparkle in their eyes was priceless,” he says. Satish Yadav, SDM, Tauru, says, “It’s heartening that NGOs as well as individuals are approaching us. They want to distribute ration to the underprivileged people. We support them so that the distribution happens smoothly. We have formed a committee at the micro level to ensure that everyone gets meals, but this special touch of adding chocolates and candies in the kits was really sweet. The kids were pleasantly surprised,” he says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/muffins-with-chapatti-along-with-rashan-these-thoughtful-treats-are-delighting-the-tiny-tots/story-W9ODCAHfvYm7L9UwJULqsK.html
06-05-2020||Today's||Post-Covid-19, the world will change. Here are 7 ways how this could happen||The coronavirus disease is wreaking havoc across the world and it is far from clear how long it will last. The full extent of the damage, both economic and non-economic, may not be known for a while. Already however, it is possible to draw some important lessons and underline key trends in a post-Covid-19 world.The State is back, and how!The centrality of the State has been brought into sharp relief during the Covid-19 crisis. Rather than debate whether it is the democratic or the authoritarian system of governance that has done better to cope with the virus, the key question to ask is what kind of a State is needed. Both South Korea and Taiwan are held out as model pupils which have coped successfully with the virus outbreak, but in both cases the State was not just ruthlessly efficient in implementing measures but also enjoyed a huge degree of trust with their respective population. In the case of China, the State was indeed strong but it is doubtful if it enjoyed the kind of trust that was necessary to tackle a crisis of this magnitude. Hence the initial missteps. Either way, the State is back!The post-coronavirus world therefore will need a strong, efficient State which enjoys the trust of its people.Public Health SecurityIt strikes one as bizarre that while countries boast of strategic food stocks and petroleum reserves to enhance their food and energy security, some of the richest countries do not have stocks of vaccines, paracetamol, masks or indeed the HCQ, or the hydroxychloroquine drug. In other words, public health security took a backseat in terms of countries’ priorities. This will definitely change.Public health security will, henceforth outflank food and energy security and will equal, if not surpass national security in the calculations of countries in the post-coronavirus world.Regional Value Chains to the foreThe era of unbridled globalisation, symbolised, inter alia, by just in time manufacturing may have run its course. The Covid-19 crisis has demonstrated that global value chains (GVCs) are extremely vulnerable and unreliable during times like this. There will be massive efforts to rework value chains based on geostrategic rather than purely economic criteria.Regional value chains, based on geostrategic criteria, may ensue for production of strategic goods and services.Social Safety Net for the poorThe economic impact of the coronavirus disease is expected to be huge and catastrophic. Already before the crisis, inequalities within countries were widening at an alarming pace. What the Covid-19 crisis has done is to highlight the terribly unequal fashion in which the virus impacts the rich and the not so rich. This is as true of rich countries such as the US where it is disproportionately affecting the Blacks or indeed in a country such as ours, where we saw the migrant labour put to distress. There is now talk of a new social compact.In the post-Covid-19 world, it will be incumbent on most states to devise some kind of a social safety net which includes not just the right to food, to shelter, to education but also to health. The Covid-19 crisis has brought the issue of social security for the poor and vulnerable among us.India’s Covid-19 DiplomacyIndia has successfully navigated not just the lockdown but has also used the strategic opportunities which presented themselves. The quick decision to export vital drugs (like HCQ and Paracetamol) to both our neighbourhood and to key friends such as US, EU, Brazil and Israel was not just based on our larger philosophy of “Vasudhaiv Kutumbakam” - ‘the whole world is one family’ - but also on our efforts to meaningfully contribute towards tackling what is clearly a global crisis.India must ramp up its production of active pharmaceutical ingredients in the near future. With around 70 per cent production of global vaccines and of drugs such as HCQ, India is well placed to fulfil the role of “net public health security provider” for the region and the world.SDGs may have to be re-calibratedAs is well known, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were agreed to after a lengthy period of negotiations and the broad deadline for achieving those are 2030. The SDG 3 in particular talks of “ensuring healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages”. Without knowing the full impact of the coronavirus disease, it is hard to predict whether the necessary progress can be made to fulfil this goal. Also, depending on the economic impact of this crisis, especially on countries such as India, the other SDG goals such as “No poverty” and “Zero Hunger” may be impacted adversely.There is a need to relook at the SDGs, both from the viewpoint of time frames as well as the resources that poor countries will need to achieve them in a timely manner.It is Geopolitics, stupid!In an ideal world, a crisis of this magnitude should make countries bury their narrow differences and get together for the sake of the common good. Yet, there is very little sign of that happening. Indeed, concrete multilateral cooperation has not been forthcoming at all.There is more than a reasonable chance that great power rivalry, parochial national interests and raw geopolitics rule the roost in a post-Covid-19 world.(Dr Mohan Kumar is a former Indian Foreign Service officer and retired as the Indian Ambassador to France)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/post-covid-19-the-world-will-change-here-are-7-ways-how-this-could-happen/story-4MMMISLXFJuGqiglDd2toO.html
06-05-2020||Editorials||Covid-19: West Bengal scores low||Given its population, the density of population, its geographical location (sharing international borders with three countries and national borders with five other states), and the high rates of migration, West Bengal should have recognised it is particularly vulnerable to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). It also had the added advantage of a strong chief minister in Mamata Banerjee, and a ruling party, Trinamool Congress, which is deeply rooted across the state. It thus had the political strength and administrative abilities to be able to track and contain the disease.Unfortunately, West Bengal has scored poorly in the battle against Covid-19. This stems from a range of factors. It began with extremely low testing. It instituted a system where deaths were audited by a committee, which would, in cases of those with co-morbidities, assign the cause of death to other ailments rather than Covid-19. It also did not rigorously follow protocols on hospital admissions, contact tracing and containment. Eventually, as a central team pointed out this week, the state ended up with one of the highest mortality rates in the country at over 12%. It also, on many days, did not put out data. All of this appears to have stemmed from the desire of the West Bengal government to show success, where success was defined as a low number of cases.This was a mistake, because pretending that the problem does not exist will not make the problem go away. It is only by taking it on aggressively that the chances of the spread of the disease get minimised. To be fair, the state government has made certain corrections. It has now adopted the Indian Council of Medical Research protocol to record fatalities, scrapped the committee to audit deaths, begun publicly putting out the number of cumulative cases, and instituted stronger isolation measures. It should learn from its mistakes and emulate best practices from now on.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/covid-19-west-bengal-scores-low/story-Jn2dCEEMDYSf2WfYASV4xM.html
06-05-2020||Editorials||The sharp dip in US-China ties||In the wake of pandemic, the rift between the United States (US) and China has deepened. Washington has said it will scrap the phase one trade deal it made with Beijing in January. The Donald Trump administration is also speaking to countries such as India about the possibility of ripping out electronic and healthcare supply chains from China. As the US president blames China for Covid-19, Chinese official media mocks the bungled US response to the pandemic. The abusive language at the highest levels of government on both sides is unusual and dangerous. Governments keep ambassadors out of the nastiest frays so that they have a path towards negotiations and reconciliation. Talk of a trade war even as the world is slipping into a recession could not be more badly timed. All is fair in trade and war, but when superpowers have only battle plans as blueprints to handle bilateral relations, the resulting scenarios range from bad to worse. That all this is happening during a global health crisis makes it even more perilous. India leans towards the US but keeps an outstretched hand to China. This allows it to maximise benefits. New Delhi has been careful not to call out Beijing regarding its handling of the outbreak. Yet, it has worked more closely with the US on almost every other element of the pandemic. Its reward: tangible assistance and public praise from both sides. The economic gains from supply chain distribution are potentially enormous but are seriously diminished if they require India to align with a single pole. The challenge for India will be to continue its present soft balancing against China without being drawn into a US containment policy, which, it is unclear Washington has either the will or the way to impose. Fortunately, India has sufficient heft that both the US or China know they must persuade rather than coerce New Delhi. Multi-alignment is the catchphrase of Indian diplomacy today, but at its core is the belief India must avoid choosing between sides until the time it is powerful enough that the choice become irrelevant. The next six months will test whether a foreign policy hedge can grow during a geopolitical storm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-sharp-dip-in-us-china-ties/story-tp2RWQliJebWUz6IAv5ftM.html
06-05-2020||Editorials||Battling the ‘locker room’ mindset| HT Editorial||Disturbing screenshots of conversations on an Instagram group called “Bois Locker Room” have recently surfaced on social media. The group, believed to be run by class 11 and 12 boys from schools in Delhi, shared photographs of teenage girls, discussed gangraping them and made sexualised comments about their bodies. Some of these boys and girls are underage. Following social media outrage, Delhi Police registered a case under 67, 67A of the Information Technology (IT) Act, and various sections of the Indian Penal Code. The Delhi Commission for Women also issued a notice to Instagram. On Tuesday, one boy was questioned.While action against the boys is imperative in the course of justice, this episode points to a larger societal problem. The conversations followed a familiar pattern of sexual violence against women and girls — of shaming, vile objectification and an assertion of power over them. These boys do not live in isolation; they are the product of a patriarchal society that has allowed “locker room talk” to go unchecked. For a long-term solution to ensure the safety of girls and gender equality, it is incumbent on society — parents, teachers, classmates, friends and peers — to rid young boys of the sexism and misogyny that are often embedded in this culture. Make no mistake: This is not just a Delhi problem. This is not just an Instagram problem either.Patriarchal societies excuse young boys for predatory behaviour and contribute to a rape culture. The incident points to how this culture has percolated down to the new generation. It can be only be fought by changing the very mindset that encouraged this violent behaviour. Adopt a policy of zero-tolerance and make it unacceptable.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/battling-the-locker-room-mindset-ht-editorial/story-sme9gqV3ab8yoXcpab6bHN.html
