20-05-2020||News||PM Modi can learn from CM Modi| Analysis||Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi, in his address to the nation on May 12, said that Rs 20 lakh crore for 2020 will be the size of India’s coronavirus disease (Covid-19) economic recovery package. It was evident that he liked how the 20s rhymed neatly. Finance minister (FM) Nirmala Sitharaman, in a daily show over the next five days, attempted to provide the details of this package. By the end of the fifth day, it was clear that the FM realised there was a huge trust deficit in the package and mounted a pugilistic public defence, in the style of her previous avatar as a party spokesperson in a cacophonous television debate. It also sparked an analysis frenzy on the gap between the PM’s “20s” and the FM’s numbers. Was the true fiscal size of the package, Rs 1 lakh crore or Rs 1.68 lakh crore or Rs 86,000 crore? Is this fiscal or monetary, an expenditure or liquidity, a demand-side or supply-side measure? This was the debate among economists, analysts, commentators and even political news anchors. The PM’s farcical Rs 20 lakh crore for 2020 claim became the focal point for all discussions on what was supposed to be a serious recovery plan to help the nation bounce back from arguably the greatest economic devastation in independent India. Millions of migrants walking home, shuttered businesses and jobless Indians do not care two hoots if the package were Rs 20 lakh or Rs 2 lakh crores, as long as they get assistance immediately to survive. Alas, India’s Covid-19 economic recovery plan has descended into a struggle for media headlines more than helping a struggling economy. But, India’s political leaders and government administrators have a successful history of the reconstruction of the economy and society after a natural disaster. One example that will resonate best today is the story of Gujarat’s reconstruction after the devastating 2001 earthquake.As the nation was celebrating its 51st Republic Day in 2001, Gujarat was hit by its worst-ever natural disaster — a 6.9 earthquake on the Richter scale. Around 20,000 people died, and 200,000 injured. A million homes, 12,000 schools, 1,200 clinics and 5,000 small businesses were destroyed. The economic impact was 3% of Gujarat’s GDP, even though the epicentre was not a major contributor to Gujarat’s economy. The Gujarat Disaster Management Authority was set up and tasked with rebuilding lives and livelihoods. An amount equivalent to 6.5% of Gujarat’s GDP and one-fifth of overall budget expenditure was immediately allocated for relief and rehabilitation. This was over the budgeted expenditure, for which money was borrowed. Gujarat’s fiscal deficit went from a budgeted 5.1% to 7.5% in FY 2001 and from 5.8% to 9.1% in FY 2002. (source: ADB) Food supplies, medical relief and cash compensation were paid immediately to the affected people. Livelihoods were restored through reconstruction activities which provided a stimulus to other sectors in the economy. This is what economists term as deficit spending in the wake of a crisis. In two years, Gujarat’s economy was back on track. No one knows this better than the then chief minister of Gujarat, who is now the prime minister.Yet, it is befuddling that Modi is being diffident about deficit spending to cushion the economic shock of the Covid-19 pandemic. Perhaps, the PM fears a potential downgrade of India’s sovereign ratings by international rating agencies if the fiscal deficit is allowed to balloon like it did in Gujarat. When the rating agency Moody’s upgraded India’s ratings in November 2017, the Modi government read it as an endorsement to pursue fiscal prudence. In which case, it is important to remind the PM that the fiscal deficit is measured as a percentage of GDP, and GDP could decline precipitously if bold and appropriate measures are not taken now. So, if GDP declines much more than it should, then the fiscal deficit is going to look bad anyway, even if the government does not indulge in additional spending. The need of the hour is to put a large chunk of money directly into the hands of the vulnerable. There is consensus among Indian industry too, some voiced publicly and most privately, that it is in their own interests to revive demand by putting money into people’s hands. It is reasonable if the government’s position is that since it is just the beginning of the financial year and the crisis still has a long way to go, one can calibrate the need for deficit spending as the situation evolves. Regardless, the timidity of the government’s response to today’s needs of the suffering millions is inexplicable and unjustifiable.India’s Covid-19 lockdown is the harshest and the longest among all countries in the world. It is then only logical that the adverse economic impact would also be the most severe in India.Just as we have now realised that Indian genes or soil cannot escape the laws of science and prevent the spread of coronavirus, it is also important to recognise there is no escape from the laws of economics of the adverse impact of a lockdown. Infantile claims such as Rs 20 lakh crores for 2020 or that the coronavirus chain of infection will be broken in 21 days are not worth discussing seriously, in this grave fight against the coronavirus and its calamitous impact.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/pm-modi-can-learn-from-cm-modi-analysis/story-szgJe9SJiUPzXQwE8y1kNL.html
20-05-2020||News||Covid-19: The science behind India’s trajectory| Analysis||In the history of mankind, there have been several pandemics from the Justinian Plague in the 6th century to the Spanish Flu (HINI influenza) in 1918. The 21st century remarkably has already seen three coronavirus-related outbreaks — the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) in 2002 which claimed 800 lives, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Mers) in 2012 (862 deaths), and now the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Despite advancements in medical sciences, it is impossible to predict when the next infectious disease outbreak will take place. So, we need to be on full alert. With India surpassing China in the overall number of infections, a comparison between the two in terms of infection trajectories is interesting. Compared to the more gradual increase of infections in India since mid-March, China witnessed a steep rise in January and February, forcing the administration to impose a strict lockdown in Wuhan on January 23 — two months earlier than India — lasting for over 70 days by which time the curve was flattened and has remained, by and large, static till date. The United States (US) and Europe have shown a trajectory similar to that of China, which makes India something of an outlier.Noticeably, India recorded nearly 45% fewer fatalities than China, although active cases remain over 60% of the total number of persons infected, as against nearly zero in China. India’s over 38% recoveries are higher than those of many nations at the same level of infection, although still lower than hotspot European nations such as Germany, Spain and Italy. Further, while the disease remained primarily confined in China to the Hubei province in general, and Wuhan in particular, India witnessed a more widespread infection with the four states of Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and Delhi accounting for two-thirds of India’s total cases. Higher recovery rates are indicative of effective adaptive immunity developing against the pathogen. On the other hand, the largely inherent immunity of the Indian population might explain the comparative lower fatality/severity rates so far observed. At this point of time, the important question is whether people who clear a SARS-CoV-2 infection can ward off the virus in the future? An answer to this will have implications for creating better vaccines. Epidemiological and nutritional factors have been discussed to explain the population-specific differential susceptibility, progression and severity/mortality of Covid-19 across the globe. Nevertheless, deciphering genetic polymorphism of the immunologically-relevant genes that influence host immunity could reveal population-specific correlates of protection and/or vulnerability to the Covid-19 challenge. The two most important of these are those encompassing the human leucocyte antigen (HLA) system and the Killer-cell Immunoglobulin-like Receptor (KIR) genes, both of which have evolved in humans to maintain a robust immune challenge to invading microbes. Substantial data exists on the genetic propensity of HLA and KIR systems in autoimmune and infectious diseases including HIV/AIDS. The highly polymorphic nature of the two genetic systems signifies their functional importance acquired during the course of evolution. They functionally regulate the body’s immune warriors, namely, the cytotoxic T-cells on one hand, and the natural killer cells on the other, both of which directly target the virus and help to eliminate it. A deep understanding of these in Covid-19 will be vital in developing effective screening tools for predicting prognosis and response to therapy, including designing individualised therapeutic strategies. In the Indian context, scientists must find answers to two critical observations. First, the observed predominantly asymptomatic clinical course of the disease, and second, the rather limited number of severe and critical cases in India so far. All efforts must be made to discover measurable immunological biomarkers that are predictive of severe disease and favourable treatment outcomes. Despite limitations in understanding the mechanistic aspects of Covid-19 pathology, the challenge is to develop strategies for recruiting innate and adaptive arms of the immune system against the virus. A recent study found that some people who have never been infected with SARS-CoV-2 harbour T-cells that target this virus, indicating that they might have previously been infected with other coronaviruses sharing sequence similarities. Again, this is encouraging data for designing therapies.The question is how long does it take to develop reasonably effective treatments for contagious diseases? Historically, while smallpox and polio took thousands of years to get an effective vaccine, HIV/AIDS took a mere 15 years before antiviral drug therapy was developed although an effective vaccine has still not been found. For Covid-19, the rapidity with which the world scientific community has got together, sharing knowledge and information in the singular task of defeating the novel coronavirus, is indeed unprecedented. Currently, all eyes are on the World Health Organization-sponsored solidarity trial that tests, in addition to the standard care, four different lines of treatment regimens to save lives in the short-term. The trial involving thousands of patients worldwide from genetically disparate population groups will test the efficacy of remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, lopanavir/ritonavir combination with or without interferon-beta. Analysing the population-specific influence of genetic systems could provide valuable information on possible differential response to treatment and long-term protection. Identifying HLA variants in infected people can help predict the severity of infection and determine who would eventually benefit from a vaccine. Science alone can motivate tomorrow’s health care providers to rise to their fullest potential and deliver life-saving devices to prevent and treat this and future viral pandemics. In this context, innovative technologies to tackle global emergencies are urgent necessities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/covid-19-the-science-behind-india-s-trajectory/story-Y1qP0xx7UWjEPujXpZJMvK.html
20-05-2020||News||In its approach to the IBC, the government got it right| Analysis||An impending suspension of India’s Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) was being widely reported till recently. For businesses pushed into default by the nationwide lockdown, such a suspension made ample sense, but speculation about a blanket suspension of all IBC insolvency admissions fuelled concern in global insolvency circles.Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s announcements are thus being met with relief, though some ambiguity remains. Her IBC-related statements centred on (i) the impact of the pandemic and lockdown on businesses, and (ii) a revision of the definition of “default” under IBC to suspend the “fresh initiation” of insolvency proceedings based on coronavirus disease (Covid-19)-related defaults. The government’s intent appears to be a limited suspension of “fresh” insolvency cases, disallowing admission based on defaults related to the pandemic. This will avoid potential pitfalls of a blanket suspension, and underscores India’s commitment to credit reforms.So as not to derail the progress of the reforms, the criteria for suspension of new admissions should not be open to interpretation, or manipulation by debtors. Since an existing default is the central criterion for insolvency admissions under IBC, and given the lockdown’s impact, the government may be contemplating suspension of insolvency admissions based on defaults occurring after the lockdown had been put in place. Such a clear and practicable delineation would keep IBC admissions in check, and yet permit admission based on pre-lockdown defaults.The announcements also referred to the suspension being for up to one year. Such a fixed-duration waiver is reassuring. It will allow borrowers hurt by the pandemic a chance to recover, or to attempt to restructure outside the unsuitably prescriptive confines of the present IBC process. It will also ease the burden on capacity-constrained insolvency tribunals, and provide an opportunity to refine the Code or regulations to best serve the changing needs of the day.Meeting the aspirations of Indians — two-thirds of them are below 35 years — requires sustained, and high, economic growth. This hinges crucially on the consistent, and appropriately priced, supply of credit. Since 2015, a series of inspired reform measures have transformed India’s reputation as a credit jurisdiction. Nearly every key player in the effort — the government, the Bankruptcy Law Reform Committee, the Joint Parliamentary Committee for IBC, the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Board, the National Company Law Tribunals, and very notably the Supreme Court — has come through remarkably in remaking India’s pariah credit regime of the past. We now take for granted outcomes that were unthinkable a mere three years ago, such as the IBC transfers of goliaths like Bhushan Steel and Essar Steel.Notably, though, India’s credit regime transformation is still a victory-in-the-making. Much remains to be done to achieve better insolvency outcomes, including wider participation, and market-driven bids in the insolvency process. In this context, the nuanced approach the government appears to have chosen will bolster India’s reputation as a jurisdiction that takes creditor and investor rights seriously. It will also reinforce the high ground Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has gained through its resolute and intelligent reforms. There are four reasons why the calibrated suspension of IBC, rather than a blanket, across-the-board suspension, is positive. First, a blanket suspension would have thwarted the battle for better insolvency outcomes. With the new law and courts in place, decades-worth of jurisprudence has been created over the past three years. The system is only now evolving to restructure companies with the participation of new management teams, turnaround experts and capital providers. Distressed investors are also trying to help modulate inflexible resolution practices, and adapting to idiosyncrasies of historical banking regulation. A blanket suspension would have dealt a blow to the new insolvency regime readying for take-off. Second, maintaining a reasonable flow of new cases based on pre-Covid-19 defaults will avoid destabilising a nascent insolvency ecosystem, which incorporates law, finance and business . If new IBC activity were to stall, investors, lawyers, restructuring advisers, etc., who have chosen to specialise in insolvency may redirect their efforts, leaving system capacity dissipated. Third, a blanket suspension would have re-energised errant borrowers. To equate such defaulters with hitherto performing borrowers pushed into default by the pandemic is inimical to logic. Enabling insolvency transfers from such borrowers has taken great resolve and responsiveness, as evidenced by Section 29A bid eligibility restrictions which prioritise system-wide, long-term benefits while sacrificing higher immediate recoveries. Finally, for investors, the limited suspension underscores the political will, vision, and grit that brought IBC to life, rather than invoking fears of the credit regime that IBC’s enactment banished. A blanket suspension of such a landmark law would have been a hark back to the whimsy-cum-grand larceny that defined Indian credit for decades. Investors are paid to worry, and would have found therein reason to doubt India’s commitment to creditor rights, property rights and the rule of law just as they are finding a surfeit of distressed opportunities elsewhere. In this time of economic distress, the answer lies not in brushing IBC aside, but in actively encouraging its application, development and evolution. Just as the world may be shifting towards government-led solutions in the post-Covid-19 era, it may help India to find faith in market-led solutions to gain a march on other jurisdictions, and create superior insolvency outcomes. Ensuring a steady supply of credit at appropriate interest rates is a pre-requisite for India’s continued economic growth and the prosperity of the next generation. In keeping its faith in IBC with only a limited suspension, the Indian government appears to have chosen wisely in letting a winner run.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/in-its-approach-to-the-ibc-the-government-got-it-right/story-8ZRSos6pYBRHCtEBFBkRWO.html
20-05-2020||News||Ending Inspector Raj in agriculture, writes Sanjeev Sanyal||One of the most important reforms announced last week by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman relates to the liberalisation of the agriculture sector. By announcing that the outdated Essential Commodities Act will be amended, she set the ball rolling for ending both license-permit raj and inspector raj in the agriculture sector. This is not merely the “1991 moment” of ending an inefficient relic of the socialist era, but the unwinding of 700 years of systematic policy bias against farmers and farm produce traders. A combination of two sets of laws have defined how farm produce is bought and sold in India — the Essential Commodities Act (ECA) and the state-level Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) Acts. ECA was enacted in 1955 to control production, supply, trade, and storage of certain commodities deemed to be essential (farm products in the list include onions, potatoes, edible oils, jute, rice paddy, sugar and so on). The Act itself does not lay out the regulations but allows states to issue “control orders” related to dealer licensing, stock limits, the power to fix prices, compulsory purchases and restrictions on transportation. In turn, the authorities are given draconian powers to raid “hoarders”, confiscate stocks, cancel licensing and even imprison offenders. The APMC system, meanwhile, forced farmers to sell their produce only through designated channels and mandis. The combination led to an inefficient regime of licenses, permits and inspectors. The drawbacks of the system were well documented over decades and many economists had argued for change. Some attempts were made to reform it piecemeal but the system had largely remained intact till now. In 2019 alone, an estimated 76,000 raids were conducted in different parts of the country under ECA. The system was not only unfair to farmers and traders, but it also was not even very good at achieving its main goal of price stability. As illustrated clearly in the latest Economic Survey (Volume 1, 2019-20), ECA actually increased the volatility of prices for commodities such as onion, pulses and sugar. It also did not lower the wedge between retail and wholesale prices. Instead, the Survey found evidence that ECA raids mostly led to the harassment of traders (merely 2-4% of ECA related cases stand up in court). It does not need a degree in economics but plain common sense to understand why the ECA-APMC system failed. Farm production is bunched according to harvests, and price stability depends on storage. By forcing farmers to sell their produce through designated channels, and placing arbitrary restrictions on inventory, the system discouraged price discovery and storage. Anyone who invested in storage ran the risk of being called a “hoarder” and facing prosecution. Thus, every year, India sees prices of vegetables such as onions swinging wildly from being too high to too low. Countries that do not even grow food (like Singapore), meanwhile, continue to enjoy stable food prices. The systematic bias in agriculture policy goes back to measures introduced seven centuries ago by Alauddin Khilji. Having conquered large swaths of India, he introduced harsh policies to artificially hold down prices and control trade. Contemporary records suggest that these measures were aimed at cheaply supporting a large army and enriching the Turkic nobility while deliberately impoverishing the general population. It is quite extraordinary that Indian school textbooks today present Khilji’s systematic exploitation as “reforms” and blame the traders who were subject to draconian punishments. This same tilted agricultural policy was used by the East India Company in the late 18th and early 19th century to force Indian farmers to grow indigo (for British industry) and opium (for China), and then sell it at depressed prices through agents. It completely impoverished rural India and caused repeated famines. In the second half of the 19th century, the system was adapted to control raw cotton prices to favour the mills of Manchester. The Berar Cotton and Grain Market Act of 1887 is the forerunner of today’s APMC acts. Importantly, the British were very careful to keep their own hands clean so that the blame fell on the traders. Thus, those who provided the supply chain were accused of “hoarding”. This is the source of the 1950s and 60s film plots. The FM’s announcement, therefore, promises to remove a deep-rooted bias against farmers and the food supply chain (not to mention a source of multilevel rent-seeking). A central law will be introduced to allow farmers to sell their produce as they wish. Barrier-free interstate trade is to be encouraged. State-level APMC laws are already being changed one-by-one to complement this change. Of course, the government will retain the power to intervene in extreme situations, say a war, when markets break down. This ends the license permit raj for the agricultural sector — three decades after this was done for the rest of the economy. It also creates a common national market for agricultural products.Sanjeev Sanyal is principal economic adviser, Government of India.

20-05-2020||News||India isn’t prepared to meet its defence needs||Last week, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman unveiled some major structural reforms in India’s moribund defence sector, as part of a coronavirus disease (Covid-19)-related macroeconomic stimulus, and the increase in foreign direct investment in defence manufacturing to 74% is radical. However, these are all policy changes that have “potential” and need to be implemented effectively before their outcome can be objectively assessed. In the interim, India’s military security challenges, both current and long-term, came into unintended focus in this month even as the nation is grappling with the pandemic and its tragic impact on millions of citizens.In early May, the Handwara terror attack saw the Indian Army losing a colonel and other personnel, pointing to the abiding tenacity of the low-intensity-conflict (LIC) that has been simmering in Kashmir. This is a complex proxy war where the external Pakistani stimulus has permeated the internal security strand with all its corrosive communal elements. It is unlikely to end soon.Currently, India is managing an anomalous territorial challenge exigency, albeit of a low order. The eastern Ladakh sector saw a stand-off between Indian and Chinese soldiers in the Pangong Tso sector. While it is well below Doklam, media reports indicate that stones were used and it is encouraging that no ordnance was exchanged, as has been the pattern for well over three decades. But the long-festering territorial dispute with China, remains alive on the national security radar.The more intriguing element is that Nepal summoned the Indian ambassador on May 11 to lodge a protest against the construction of a road by India in an area (Lipu Lekh pass to Dharchula in Uttarakhand) that Kathmandu claims lies within its territory.To add to the spectrum of challenges, reports have emerged of China enhancing its Indian Ocean (IO) footprint in an island proximate to Male in the Maldives. Thus the possibility of a Hambantota kind of facility/access for the PLA navy in the IO cannot be ignored by Indian security planners. And to cap this opaque security challenge, May also symbolises India’s complex nuclear-missile anxiety. The regional strategic environment became rough for India when China acquired nuclear weapons in October 1964; the subsequent Sino-Pakistan weapons of mass destruction (WMD) covert cooperation presented Delhi with a sui generis security conundrum. The Pakistani nuclear weapon that Beijing had enabled was being used to help terrorism stoked by religious fervour — what one had described as the nuclear weapon-enabled terrorism (NWET) dilemma.India sought to assuage its latent WMD anxiety in May 1998 through the Shakti nuclear tests under Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s watch on May 11. Two decades later, the regional WMD-terror nexus has become muddier and the techno-strategic permutations are bewildering.Does India have the wherewithal to deal effectively with this complex spectrum of national security challenges — one part of which is further aggravated by the current domestic political-ideological orientation? The answer is no — and for years experts have been pointing out that the annual defence allocation cannot sustain the kind of human, material and inventory profile that India needs. The last defence budget (excluding pensions) was Rs 3,37,000 crore. The amount available for modernisation of equipment and new acquisitions was shrinking to about 32% from the optimum of 40% of the budget.In the backdrop of Covid-19, India’s macroeconomic challenge will worsen. The fiscal deficit is set to breach the recommended 3.5% limit; the only question is how high it would go. On May 8, the government pegged central borrowing for 2020-21 at Rs 12,00,000 crore — a significant increase from the budget estimate of Rs 7,80,000 crore. This fiscal stress will have a bearing on sectors earlier referred to as “non-plan” in the budgetary allocation, of which defence is a visible component. Thus, it is unlikely that the armed forces will receive anything close to Rs 3,50,000 crore (approx $46 billion). There are also unconfirmed reports of a budget slash in defence allocation due to Covid-19, ranging from Rs 40,000 to Rs 80,000 crore.Given that the Covid-19 challenge and its accumulating debris of economic devastation and human destitution will be the higher national priority for some years, India will have to embark on a radical review of its security challenges and the road map to deal with this complex spectrum. Many nations are facing a similar predicament, but some abiding elements in the Indian context must be noted. Strategic geography and its attendant security exigencies will not change due to the pandemic. The low-intensity conflict stoked by Pakistan and the internal security fabric will be turbulent and the political apex will seek to assuage national sentiment in this regard.What kind of military capability India needs, its technological contour, and how this can be both nurtured and sustained in an affordable manner in a post-Covid-19 world needs careful and objective assessment. Against this backdrop, some of the sweeping remarks attributed to the Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat, justifying lower defence spend and suggesting that the military may have been misrepresenting its requirements are perplexing, to put it mildly. One hopes this is not the distilled wisdom of Modi 2.0 in the security domain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/india-isn-t-prepared-to-meet-its-defence-needs/story-pMlergps6SmoHC6N0vZhsO.html
20-05-2020||Mumbai||Home quarantine cases rise 73% in past 10 days||With the growing number of cases of Covid-19 in the state, the number of people who are kept in quarantine has also increased rapidly. Since May 10, home quarantine has increased by 73% while institutional quarantine has surged by 85%, as per data from the state health department.On May 10, 2,33,327 people were home quarantined in Maharashtra. This number increased to 4,04,692 on May 19. In the same period, 14,465 people were kept in isolation at institutional quarantine centres and this number rose to 26,752 on Tuesday.According to medical experts, the rise in number of those quarantined at home is because of the change in discharge policy. Under the new rules, asymptomatic patients should be sent home from the second-tier Covid care centres (CCC2), which are government-run centres where doctors and nurses are on duty round the clock. City-based epidemiologist Dr Om Srivastava said, “Now, asymptomatic patients are advised to stay at home if it is feasible. Thus, the number of home quarantines has increased. Our primary focus is on patients with symptoms as they are more contagious.”Over 4.5 lakh people have been kept in institutional quarantine in Maharashtra.The number under contact tracing has also increased. All high-risk contacts are being shifted to the first tier Covid care centres (CCC1), which are located in hotels, newly-constructed buildings and similar structures, but don’t have round-the-clock medical care.“At places, especially in slums where social distancing is not feasible, we isolate the high-risk contacts in lodges, hotels and other structures so that they don’t contract the infection. So, with a rise in cases, the number of institutional quarantine will also increase,” said Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/home-quarantine-cases-rise-73-in-past-10-days/story-s6w3B82L0xmET308JJqpUI.html
20-05-2020||Mumbai||City breathes cleanest air of the year, AQI drops to 28||The city recorded its cleanest air day during the lockdown period and this year so far on Wednesday with the air quality index (AQI) for PM2.5 - a breathable particulate matter of 2.5 micron or lesser - dropping to 28, falling under the ‘good’ category.According to the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), the AQI on Tuesday was 56 (satisfactory) and had shot up to 90 (satisfactory) on Sunday. Wednesday’s AQI however, increased to 32 (good) by the evening. Eight of 10 locations recorded ‘good’ air quality with only Worli and Mazagaon recording ‘satisfactory’ levels. Even the AQI published by the Central Pollution Control Board on Wednesday was 48, falling under the ‘good’ category.The improvement in air quality was attributed to a marginal increase in wind speed and changing weather conditions influenced by the severe tropical cyclone Amphan over the east coast, said SAFAR researchers.“The effect of the cyclone has an impact over the west coast and allows the increase in wind speed or sea breeze (westerly winds) temporarily,” said Gufran Beig, director, SAFAR adding that the AQI was likely to rise to 43 (good). “Combined with this high moisture incursions due to warm weather enhances the pollutant carrying capacity, and marginally high wind speed disperses this layer faster.”The wind speed started increasing from Tuesday morning 4 knots (7.4 km/h) to 5 knots (9.2 km/h) by the evening and continued to be 4 knots through Wednesday at the Santacruz weather station while it ranged between 2 and 3 knots at Colaba, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD).“Cyclones do impact wind pattern and weather conditions in the influential radius of a 1,000 km or more and leads to northwesterly winds for peninsular India at a marginally higher speed. However, one has to check the data for Mumbai to see if this is the case,” said B Mukhopadhyay, former additional director-general of the meteorology of IMD, Pune.Independent meteorologists said cyclone Amphan was too far from Mumbai for causing any prominent enhancement of surface wind speed for Mumbai. “However, surface winds have been persistently from the west due to the cyclone, which along with the lowdown effect has drastically improved the city’s air quality. The air quality worsens when the surface wind is from other direction such as the east,” said Akshay Deoaras, independent meteorologist and PhD researcher at the University of Reading, UK.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/city-breathes-cleanest-air-of-the-year-aqi-drops-to-28/story-06sA8pPp8E5Xh9RfjdypuK.html

He does not have respiratory issues, but he is diabetic. We did not mind if it was a private or a BMC-affiliated hospital. We needed quick help as my father is bedridden,” said Harshal. Shiravdekar and his wife both had dry cough, however, only Sudhakar tested positive.Harshal added that on Tuesday morning, following the test report, the civic body sanitised their house as well as the society premises. As a result, Harshal and his family, who live a few blocks away, were asked to not stay with the couple in a bid to not expose them to the infection. However, due to the unavailability of a bed, Shiravdekar’s wife stayed with him in the same flat as he required special care. “My parents, both of whom are elderly, have been staying alone. We are helpless,” said Harshal. He added that after continuously seeking an update on the bed, he received a call on Wednesday morning that an ambulance would be sent to pick up Shiravdekar. However, the ambulance arrived only around 3pm.“We do not have complaints about the civic body. But, in a situation such as this, a patient’s family needs to be guided. Hospital bed and ambulances need to be made available,” Harshal said.Kiran Dighavkar, assistant municipal commissioner, said after a bed was allotted to the patient, a request has been made for a special ICU bed for him because of his co-morbidity. “I received a call on Tuesday evening. It isn’t right to say that he had to wait for two days because we arranged the bed on Wednesday morning.

The commission also directed the company to either replace the defective car or refund ₹22.10 lakh to the customer.Vivek Kundu, a Sector 38 resident, stated in his complaint, that he had approached Sidhant Motors (Tara Ford) in Hisar, Haryana, which is the authorised dealership of Ford India (opposite party) to buy its Endeavour Trend 2.2 L, 4x4 MT. He bought the SUV in January 2017 for ₹22. 10 lakh.However, within a month, the dashboard began to rattle with excessive noise and vibrations. In February, it broke down several times, parts had to be replaced, wipers began making shuddering sounds and tyres developed cracks.He said the vehicle had been manufactured in April 2016, instead of December 2016, as represented by the agent. Accusing them of sheer unfair trade practices by selling off an old model as a brand new vehicle, he demanded that his vehicle be replaced with a new one.In its reply, Ford India–Gurgaon (opposite party no.2) which is the corporate office of Ford India and Ford India–Tamil Nadu (opposite party no.1), said they were neither necessary nor proper parties and as such, the complaint against them is liable to be dismissed.“The complaint is liable to be dismissed as the complainant has miserably failed to establish any manufacturing defect in the vehicle by leading any expert evidence,” added Ford.To ascertain the true picture, the commission directed the director of Punjab Engineering College, Chandigarh, to constitute a team of two experts to look into the matter and submit a report to this commission. As per report, there were defects.The commission directed Ford India–Gurgaon and Ford India–Tamil Nadu and their agent in Hisar to jointly and severally, replace the vehicle with a brand new vehicle of same specifications/ features within period of 45 days from the date of receipt of certified copies of this order.

20-05-2020||Chandigarh||Calling Chandigarh admn order arbitrary, private schools demand consolidated fee||A day after the education department allowed Chandigarh schools to collect monthly tuition fee, most schools are violating orders by asking for additional fees such as annual fee, hobby fee and caution fee, under the umbrella of ‘consolidated fee’ instead of tuition fee.Schools, meanwhile, have already moved Punjab and Haryana high court challenging the UT’s order for collecting only tuition fees. Schools have petitioned that UT has no jurisdiction to pass such orders, and under law, there is a provision of a fee regulatory authority. A parent whose children are studying in a prominent Sector-26 school, said, “First they asked for a quarterly fee. Today they altered their order showing ₹7,568 as monthly fee under the term ‘consolidated fee’ which only excludes hobby fee. And this is after specific permission to charge only tuition fee.”“Last year, the school charged ₹11,790 as quarterly tuition fee and ₹15,510 as consolidated fee. This means they are now charging even more,” the parent said.Another parent whose kids study in a Sector-40 school said, “The school wants us to pay a consolidated amount for two months before May 31. When I called them for clarity, they said it’s a sum of all fee heads including tuition, annual, admission, caution fees etc.”Advocate for schools Ashish Chopra said, “Schools have different heads under which they charge a fee. UT’s order is arbitrary.” Chairperson of Independent School Association, HS Mamik, said most Chandigarh schools charge consolidated fees, and only a handful of schools have separate heads for charging fees. This why they are charging consolidated fees.”In an official press release, the UT administration, while informing the public about Tuesday’s order, said the matter was sub-judice, with next hearing on May 22.Chandigarh school education director Rubinderjit Singh Brar said he could not comment as the matter is was in court.Nitin Goyal, president of Chandigarh Parents Association, said, “We had told the administration that schools have merged all funds as consolidated ‘tuition’ fees, so the education department’s order was not practical. However, it was still passed to benefit the school lobby.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ut-order-arbitrary-chandigarh-schools-demand-consolidated-fee/story-YL7OuZ8EJIU5MDFv8tL7kM.html

Of these patients, several had been brought to the emergency ward of the hospital and found Covid-19 positive later.The hospital has now set up a five-member committee, chaired by Dr Rajoo Singh Chhina, dean (academics) and chairperson of the Hospital Infection Control Committee, to screen its staffers and bring back those who didn’t directly come in contact with the patients.The development comes four days after a two-year-old girl from Mandeep Nagar in Choti Haibowal, who was rushed to the hospital with abdominal pain, was found to be infected. According to health authorities, she is the youngest Covid patient in Ludhiana. Doctors performed an emergency intestinal surgery on her, following which her samples were sent for Covid testing.After the child tested positive, DMCH authorities asked 35 employees, including, doctors and paramedical staff, to go into home quarantine for 14 days.Earlier on May 13, as many as 160 employees, including doctors and paramedical staff of DMCH were sent into home isolation after two ward boys tested positive. On Wednesday, the reports of 119 staffers, who were tested after the ward boys were found infected, came in negative.The hospital’s Covid in-charge Dr Ashwani Chaudhary said the employees were quarantined as a preventive measure.Sources said that besides a patient from Jammu, the staff had come in contact with three Ludhiana patients from Khanna, Rajpura and Faridkot, who were scheduled to undergo surgeries at the hospital.Dr Chhina said, “We have to follow the universal infection control protocol while treating any patient visiting the hospital. Further, we are conducting a special screening as per the guidelines issued by World Health Organisation (WHO) and Ministry of Health.”Dr Chaudhary said that the primary and secondary contacts have been segregated. “While the secondary contacts, such as those who crossed the area where the Covid-19 patient was kept, will be called back on duty after a week, the condition of primary contacts will be monitored and they will be kept under isolation for 14- days.”The hospital has been battling to control infection ever since the outbreak in March. The hospital even had to close down its OPD services for some time. DMCH principal Sandeep Puri and other senior doctors remained in quarantine in March after the patient they were treating turned out to be the first Covid-19 case of the city.Four Covid-19 patients, a 31-year-old male from Ludhiana, a 69-year-old woman from Gurdaspur, 60-year-old man for Faridkot and 52-year-old man from Patiala were discharged from the hospital on Wednesday after recovery.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/with-200-staff-members-in-quarantine-ludhiana-dmch-s-battle-gets-tougher/story-Ip2cZ6Hav7puYlz9WB2B6O.html

20-05-2020||Chandigarh||‘Probe role of senior Congmen in Khanna illegal distillery case’||The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Wednesday asked chief minister Amarinder Singh to take action against the kingpins in the Khanna illegal distillery case by investigating the alleged role of Congress’ Ludhiana MP Ravneet Bittu, Khanna MLA Gurkirat Kotli and his Payal counterpart Lakhbir Singh Lakha instead of doing a cover-up by arresting the small fish.In a press release, SAD leader Maheshinder Singh Grewal said though the government arrested one of the frontmen running the illegal distillery-cum-bottling plant, the action was too late. “We demand that the government enquire into the role of Congress leaders who patronised the accused.” Grewal said it was shameful that the Khanna police took a fortnight to take action against Kulwinder Singh Kala despite a huge public outcry only because he enjoyed the patronage of the Khanna MLA and senior Congress leaders. “This is the second time the Congress government has taken action against small fish in the Rs 5,600 crore excise scam case. Earlier, in the Ghanaur illegal distillery case the government took action against two local Congress leaders, including a sarpanch, instead of arresting party legislators Madan Lal Jalalpur and Hardyal Kamboj who were the kingpins in the case.” The Akali leader said strict action was needed in the case to break the politico- liquor mafia nexus as well end the Congress leaders’ bootlegging business that was endangering the lives of thousands of people. He said an independent inquiry should be ordered into the case by a central agency or a sitting judge of the high court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/probe-role-of-senior-congmen-in-khanna-illegal-distillery-case/story-uqXPMMoHmQAxOXolJtUgoI.html

However, there’s no sale as restaurants, bars and clubs have been shut for the past two months and there’s no hope for our business to revive soon,” said Amanvir Singh, president, Punjab Hotels and Restaurants Association. The charges for luxury hotels are even higher, he added.Singh said, “We had approached the officials of the excise department to seek exemption of licence fee and other charges for three months from April to June, but they are forcing us to deposit the entire charges applicable.”He said there are at least 10,000 hotels, restaurants, clubs and bars in the state that sell liquor and beer. There are 4,000 marriage palaces in the state, which are also members of the association.Excise and taxation commissioner VP Singh said his department is aware of the issue and would soon work out a solution. He, however, said the number of clubs, hotels, bars and restaurants in the state is not as huge as claimed by Singh.Cabinet minister Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria, who is part of the group of ministers (GoM) constituted to hear the grievances of liquor contractors, said that the GoM would also hold meetings with the hotel and bar owners.

20-05-2020||Chandigarh||CS-MINISTERS’ SPAT: Punjab CM takes luncheon diplomacy route; Randhawa, MLAs reiterate demands||Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Wednesday took the luncheon diplomacy route to try and break the deadlock over the spat between chief secretary Karan Avtar Singh and his ministers.The CM met Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar, cooperation minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa and MLAs Amrinder Singh Raja Warring, Pargat Singh and Sangat Singh Gilzian at his farmhouse in Siswan village near here. These leaders, who were invited for an ‘informal lunch’, had last week vociferously demanded the removal of Karan Avtar Singh from the chief secretary’s post and probe into the excise revenue losses.‘LUNCH HOSTED TO BREAK THE ICE’Jakhar said the CM called the meeting to break the ice and it was held in a cordial atmosphere. “The issue related to CS, which is agitating the minds of ministers and MLAs, was also discussed. The CM heard them out and shared his own views. The idea was to strengthen the party and see that the state comes out of this crisis in a better shape,” he said.Randhawa, Warring and Gilzian, who have been upset over delay in action against the 1984-batch IAS officer, raised the issues of his removal and excise revenue losses without mincing any words. “The chief minister was told that the chief secretary’s demeanour and attitude towards the ministers during the pre-cabinet meeting was improper. If he (Karan Avtar) continues to be there with this kind of attitude, how will things work?” one of them said after the meeting, adding, “The CM was told that wrong perception is getting created about the government”.Pargat, who had also hit out against the government on Sunday for failing to set up an excise corporation, stressed the need to check liquor smuggling and dip in excise revenue at the meeting. “I suggested that the state should try it (excise corporation) to raise its revenue and stop smuggling as this model is working well in at least two states,” he said. Both Randhawa and Pargat later said that the CM told them he would look into all these issues.CM GAVE A PATIENT HEARINGAt the meeting, Amarinder, who gave the minister and MLAs a patient hearing, also told them about all the steps taken by the state government to stop the illegal smuggling, leakages and revenue loss, besides instructions issued to the director general of police (DGP) to hold senior superintendents of police (SSPs) and station house officers (SHOs) accountable for any laxity, according to sources. They said the CM also asked Randhawa about the CS’ apology to the ministers at the pre-cabinet meeting but was told that the officer went to finance minister Manpreet Badal and expressed regret to him when the minister was sitting in his car and ready to leave.Randhawa, Jakhar and several other ministers and MLAs have been seeking action against Karan Avtar following his run-in with finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal and technical education minister Charanjit Singh Channi over the state excise policy more than 10 days ago. While Pargat, Warring and Gilzian went to the CM’s farmhouse with Randhawa, Jakhar came separately.Meanwhile, an official spokesperson, while confirming that the party leaders raised the issue of the chief secretary and the alleged excise revenue losses, said they discussed the dynamically evolving Covid situation and the prolonged lockdown in the state. “In view of the social distancing norms and stringent Covid-related safety protocols in place, Amarinder had invited only a handful of party leaders and members”.The spokesperson, in a written statement, further said they shared with the CM their suggestions on the Covid pandemic and the problems faced by the state due to the resultant lockdown, besides congratulating him on the various steps taken to keep the spread of the pandemic under check.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/cs-ministers-spat-punjab-cm-takes-luncheon-diplomacy-route-randhawa-mlas-reiterate-demands/story-ehVMYaIVMwTNrswS7AwfaK.html
20-05-2020||City||De-addiction clinics in Tarn Taran, Amritsar face medicine shortage||The government-run outpatient opioid assisted treatment (OOAT) centres in Tarn Taran and Amritsar districts are facing shortage of vital medicines required for treating drug abuse victims, mainly due to the spike in number of patients during the lockdown period. The authorities at these centres say due to the shortage in the stock they are now giving daily dose instead of providing take-home medicines to the patients for two weeks. Earlier in March, the Punjab government had instructed all 198 OOAT centres, 35 government de-addiction centres and 108 licensed private de-addiction centres to provide take-home doses of buprenorphine and naloxone for two weeks after an assessment by the psychiatrists. The step was taken to maintain social distancing among the patients at the centres due to the coronavirus pandemic.More than 40,000 patients are registered in government and private de-addiction centres in Tarn Taran and Amritsar districts. Most of the patients rely on 14 OOAT centers in Tarn Taran and nine in Amritsar. “For the past one week, I have been forced to travel for over 30km daily to take my daily dose. Sometimes, I even return without the dose,” said 28-year-old patient from Algonkothi village of Bhikhiwind subdivision in Amritsar. The authorities cite increased load of patients due to the lockdown as the main reason behind the shortage of medicines.“Since the lockdown, 4,000 new patients have registered themselves and a large number of drop-out patients have resumed treatment in Tarn Taran. Due to this, the consumption of medicines has increased,” said Dr Jaspreet Singh, medical officer (MO) of Bhagupur OOAT centre. On Tuesday, around 50 patients held a protest in Tarn Taran civil hospital alleging they were not given the medicines. Tarn Taran civil surgeon Dr Anoop Kumar said, “The patients who protested were given the medicine later. Due to the increased load of patients, the shortage of medicines is witnessed in the entire state. We have already written to the senior authorities about the demand of the medicine.” Dr Rajive Arora, MO at the government OOAT centre in Amritsar medical college, said, “Earlier we had been giving 15-day take-home medicine to the patients. Now, due to the shortage in supply, we are giving daily dose to them. We have been assured that the supply will soon be regularised.”7,134 new patients registered in Sangrur during lockdownMeanwhile, as many as 7,134 new patients got themselves registered at OOAT clinics for de-addiction treatment during the lockdown period in Sangrur district.Deputy Commissioner (DC) Ghanshyam Thori said, “Due to non-availability of drugs, the addicts are voluntarily getting themselves registered at the de-addiction centres.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/de-addiction-clinics-in-tarn-taran-amritsar-face-medicine-shortage/story-yb9EarejOpzPz4lJB4OqsO.html

20-05-2020||Delhi||Another prisoner and superintendent test positive, number of infections in Tihar up to 17||An assistant superintendent of Rohini Jail has tested positive for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), officials said Wednesday. Senior officials said that because the superintendent lived in staff quarters within the Tihar Jail complex, at least 13 of his neighbours and close contacts from work have also been asked to quarantine themselves.With this, the total number of positive cases from Delhi prisons has now increased to 17. While 15 of them are prisoners, two are staff members, including a jail warden.The director-general (Delhi prisons) Sandeep Goel said the 50-year-old official posted to Rohini Jail started feeling unwell a few days ago and was advised to take rest at home.“He lives in the prison’s staff quarters in Tihar complex. He got himself tested at the Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital and his result arrived on Tuesday. Presently he is quarantined at home,” Goel said.Goel said they had identified 13 of the official’s close contacts, including his neighbours and colleagues, who have been asked to quarantine themselves at home for the next 14 days.So far, all the 16 prisoners who tested positive had been lodged in Rohini Jail for about three months. Following the positive reports in Rohini, a high alert was sounded in Tihar Jail, where around 15,000 prisoners are currently lodged in different sub-jails. Rohini Jail has 1,370 prisoners within its walls. With families of prisoners barred from visiting inmates and court hearings currently being held inside the prison over video conference, jail officers suspect the virus may have been transferred through an asymptomatic jail officer. To contain the disease, the bi-weekly visits of all family members have been cancelled. Prisoners have been allowed to use the jail’s phone to speak to their family members everyday.Tihar Jail’s officials are on high alert after reports of the disease spreading rapidly in Mumbai’s Arthur Road jail. In Mumbai’s Arthur Road Jail where 4,000 prisoners are lodged, the infection had affected 184 prisoners and prison staff within a week of one prisoner contracting the virus. It also prompted Maharashtra to look at releasing half the prisoners in its jails to contain the spread of the disease. Tihar Jail officers have also decongested the prison by releasing around 3,000 prisoners on interim bail and parole. At 18,000, Tihar Jail houses the most number of inmates across the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/another-prisoner-and-superintendent-test-positive-number-of-infections-in-tihar-up-to-17/story-SMtGAu9mJKusLNuRPncJzJ.html

Of them, 249 people, which accounted for 31.59% of the migrants testing positive, had returned from Delhi; followed by 187 (23.73%) from Maharashtra and 158 (20.05%) from Gujarat.Migrants now accounted for over 52% of Bihar’s total Covid-19 cases, given the fact that 58 workers, who returned to the state before lockdown 3.0 (from May 4-17), had also tested positive for the virus.Altogether, 571 patients had recovered so far, after 37 people were cured and discharged from different health facilities during the past 24 hours, said Singh. Nine people, who contracted the virus, have died in the state so far.The case recovery rate was 36% in the state. This had slid from around 55%, as recorded prior to the home-coming of the migrant workers in large number by Shramik Special trains, operating from May 2.Bihar expects to receive around 12 lakh migrant workers more by the end of this month. It has already received around 6.10 lakh migrant workers till Tuesday, as per data shared by Anupam Kumar, secretary, Bihar’s information and public relations department.Of the cases reported today, Khagaria accounted for 15, followed by Bhagalpur (12), Banka (11), Madhubani, Nalanda and Darbhanga (6 each), Supaul (2) and one each in Gopalganj and Katihar, as per information shared earlier in the day through a tweet by Sanjay Kumar, Bihar’s outgoing principal secretary, health.

20-05-2020||Patna||Top health official removed in Bihar||Amid the raging coronavirus pandemic which has so far infected over 1600 people in the state, the Bihar government Wednesday replaced Sanjay Kumar with Udai Singh Kumawat as principal secretary (health), a notification issued with the state’s general administrative department (GAD) said, but cited no reason for the sudden shuffle.While Kumar is a 1990-batch Indian administrative service (IAS) officer, Kumawat is from 1993 batch. Kumar will replace Kumawat in the state’s tourism department, where the latter was principal secretary. Kumawat was posted with the tourism department as its principal secretary since August last year. After serving as joint secretary with the Union finance ministry, He was repatriated to Bihar in August 2017. A senior officer of the Central government alleged that a Kumawat was sent back to his home cadre of Bihar before completing his deputation stint, owing to his controversial stint in the ministry. He was also a member of the special investigation team (SIT) on Black Money Commission by the Centre.A section of senior bureaucrats claimed chief minister Nitish Kumar was unhappy over the way the drive against Covid was being carried out by the health department under Sanjay Kumar’s leadership. “The department was failing to meet the target of conducting 10,000 tests for Covid every day after the massive surge of migrants in the state despite the CM’s insistence. We were able to conduct around only 2,000 tests daily. Doctors and medical staff, the frontline warriors, had also reportedly complained against the officer for taking unreasonable action against their colleagues,” a senior official said.The health department was also unable to ensure opening of private hospitals to resume its normal operations despite repeated reminders from the CM during the videoconferencing with senior officers on Covid.The NItish Kumar government has been under fire from the Opposition over “poor” facilities at quarantine centres, many of which reported incidents of inmates breaking out and fleeing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/top-health-official-removed-in-bihar/story-FKZucAlhQfm3PzisndPhqI.html

It is a god-given gift. The district administration has been helping us a lot.”Purnia district magistrate (DM) Rahul Kumar said, “During skill mapping of the migrant workers lodged at the quarantine centres at Shrinagar block, we had identified several migrants who had knowledge of tailoring. As many as 73 migrants with tailoring skills have been engaged in making of three-layer masks.”The migrants have completed their quarantine period. “All the 73 migrants identified had come from Kerala by special trains and were quarantined at their home block,” Shrinagar block development officer (BDO) Om Prakash said.“The migrants started making the masks on Wednesday and we are expecting production of at least 1,000 to 1,500 masks daily” he said. “The migrants will earn between ₹600 to ₹ 800 per day depending upon their speed and efficiency,” said the BDO.

20-05-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab flattens Covid curve over past week||Even as Punjab continues to remain among the top 10 worst-hit states of the country with those testing positive for the coronavirus crossing the 2,000-mark, a dip in the number of new cases in the last week has come as a relief to the authorities concerned. Also, the state witnessed a sharp jump in recovery rate among the infected patients. The development comes after the number of new cases saw a surge of up to 200-300-odd cases a day in the first week of May, especially after the arrival of Sikh pilgrims from Takht Hazur Sahib in Maharashtra’s Nanded.In the past week starting May 13, the state has added has added only 81 cases, as per the data released by the health department.The rate of recovery saw a massive jump with 89% coronavirus patients having been declared cured during the same period. On Wednesday, the data showed only 173 active cases.JUST 200 PATIENTS WERE CURED TILL LAST WEEKUntil last week, only 200 of a total of 1,924 patients were cured, showing only 10% recovery rate. However, with 1,492 patients declared cured in the last week, Punjab’s recovery rate is far ahead of the nine-worst hit states.Figures suggest that Punjab’s positive cases touched 500 on May 1 and crossed the 1,000 mark just within two days on May 3. In next three days, the state crossed 1,500 cases whereas the last 500 cases were added to the tally in 13 days. Dr Rajesh Bhaskar, state nodal officer for Covid-19, said Punjab’s doubling rate of cases increased to 90 days as on Tuesday and it was among the top five states in this regard.“Nearly 1,350 positive patients, including 1,250 Nanded-returned pilgrims and 90 labourers who came to Punjab from other states, were declared cured. The state has improved remarkably on all key points,” said the nodal officer.The state’s mortality rate has also decreased to 1.8%, bringing some respite to the state government which was facing the heat over having fatality rate double the national average.Before the arrival of Nanded pilgrims, the state’s mortality rate at one point of time was more than double the national average, compelling the chief minister to order audit of all deaths. So far, state has witnessed 38 Covid-19 deaths. “Actually, the state faced criticism for mismanagement in bringing the Nanded pilgrims back as their arrival resulted in a sudden increase in cases. At the same time, their release from hospitals improved Punjab’s recovery, fatality and doubling rates,” said a senior health department official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-flattens-covid-curve-over-past-week/story-4vR2dyBie2dhPeJtLmHb3J.html

20-05-2020||Gurugram||Aftermath of stone-pelting: Illegal cross-border route blocked||As the authorities raised a wall at the border adjoining Salapur Khera village in Delhi and Gurugram on Wednesday, used by many to circumvent the border checkpost, many daily wage workers alleged harassment from the police and said that they were denied entry despite procuring movement passes. Several feared that they would lose their jobs if they were not allowed through.The 10-meter lane in the village was a route between Gurugram and Delhi. It earlier had a wall that blocked such an access. However, over the last 20 years, wall was partially demolished and the route was used by thousands — mostly migrant workers employed in industries and factories in Udyog Vihar and Palam Vihar — to commute between the two cities.“I have been going to work using this route for a decade. Now, there is a wall blocking the movement,” said Sudhir Kumar, a Gorakhpur native, who works in a software company in the city. “What is the point of issuing movement passes if the entry is barred. After I was stopped from entering from Salapur, I went to the Dundahera side but police did not allow me to pass. We have suffered already due to the lockdown and are struggling to survive.”Avinash, who works as a delivery person with an e-commerce firm in sector 18, said, “I was on my way to work when I was stopped by the police. I showed them the e-pass but they said it was invalid and tore it up. The police said only essential service workers would be allowed to pass. I have not been paid for past two months as I could not go to work due to the lockdown. This has worsened the situation.”Police said that they had deployed force and the civic authorities constructed the wall at Salapur border after complaints from residents of sector-21 and after the Haryana government had issued instructions to seal interstate borders on May 1. “This is not a legal route for commuting,” said Rajender Kumar, SHO, Palam Vihar police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/aftermath-of-stone-pelting-illegal-cross-border-route-blocked/story-ammb5X9E2al5HwYMqJFCtJ.html
20-05-2020||Gurugram||Seven cops hurt as Delhi mob pelts stones upon being denied cross-border entry||At least seven policemen were injured after a large group of people, mostly factory workers, allegedly pelted stones at them after being denied entry to the city through the Salapur (Delhi) border in Palam Vihar on Wednesday morning. Over 1,070 people were booked and three arrested, the police said.The police said the stone-pelting went on for around 25 minutes, during which additional force was deployed and the situation was brought under control. Senior police officials also reached the spot.The workers and residents of Salapur Khera village, however, alleged that police had charged at them with their canes after denying them entry and tearing up the movement passes issued by their companies. The police have refuted these allegations.Salapur is located in Delhi, adjoining Sector 21 of Gurugram. The route that is currently being used has been cut through vacant plots of the sector. The incident comes exactly a week after residents of Sector 21, on May 14, sought stricter vigil by the police at the porous border, over concerns of spread of Covid-19.According to the police, a large crowd of at least 1,000 people — mostly daily wage earners working in private companies in the industrial hub of Udyog Vihar — had gathered on foot and cycles at the Salapur border around 8.30am, demanding entry into the city via Sector 21, a residential sector developed by the Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) over two decades ago.The police said when the workers were stopped, they started sloganeering and anti-social elements incited the crowd to pelt stones.Rajender Kumar, station house officer, (SHO), Palam Vihar police station, said, “We tried to aggressively push the crowd back, but they started pelting stones at the police. The workers were supported by village residents. An additional force of 50 policemen was called in and the situation was brought under control. This is not a legal route for commuting. We had deployed police at Salapur border after complaints from residents, and after the Haryana government issued instructions to seal interstate borders on May 1.”“This is not a legal route for commuting. Attaining a movement pass does not imply that one can commute through inter-state borders on a daily basis. After crossing the border with a movement pass, it is the responsibility of the employers to make arrangements for the stay of workers within the state. We have communicated the same to employers,” said Kumar.One of the persons named in the FIR, who works in a private company in Manesar, said that he was beaten with a stick. “I was on my way to work when police stopped me. So, I decided to return. Suddenly a policeman charged towards me and assaulted me with a stick,” he said, adding that he sustained a shoulder injury. The police denied that he was beaten up and said that they were investigating.In a video circulated on an instant messaging application, several people, standing in a narrow lane of Salapur Khera village, are seen hurling stones and bricks at the police. Some of the people can be heard saying, “Don’t throw stones. Let’s just talk.” A policeman is also seen throwing stones at the protesters, which was denied by police officials. In another such video, at least two police officials can be seen hitting the workers with a cane as police push them back.The police department said they are yet to establish the authenticity of the videos.The workers alleged that police had stopped them despite them having requisite passes. They alleged that a pregnant woman was also assaulted. Shakuntala Devi, a worker, said, “Police stopped us from entering the city and when we protested, they assaulted a woman and then workers pelted the stones. She had to be rushed to the hospital.”Police denied the allegations as ”hearsay”. SHO Kumar said, “No woman was assaulted in the incident by the police.”A sub-inspector from the Kapashera police station in Delhi, the police station under whose jurisdiction Salapur Khera falls, said that they had not received any complaint of a woman being assaulted from the village.A police official privy to the investigation, requesting anonymity, said, “Seven policemen sustained minor injuries. They were protected by the cane shields. In the FIR, six people have been mentioned by name and 1,070 are unidentified.”In the FIR, police said that over 900 men and 170 women had allegedly attacked them after argument over passage through the border. Police also said that the window panes of a police vehicle were shattered during the stone-pelting.Residents of Sector 21 have repeatedly demanded that the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) build a wall at the periphery and block the route permanently.Shashipal Yadav, the president of Sector 21 residents’ welfare association (RWA), said, “Sector 21 shared a long peripheral boundary wall with Salapur until five years ago. The boundary wall was broken at places by Salapur residents to make illegal routes. The MCG is aware of the issue. We have demanded by writing letters to raise a wall and block illegal routes.”Vinay Pratap Singh, the MCG commissioner, said, “The MCG took cognizance of the offence and issued instructions to field officials to inspect the site and take action, including raising a boundary wall, if needed. Walls are being raised to block the movement of people through this route.”A case was registered against the accused persons under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and Disaster Management Act at Palam Vihar police station on Wednesday, said police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/seven-cops-hurt-as-delhi-mob-pelts-stones-upon-being-denied-cross-border-entry/story-msShtzm4BFfZRnQlTJJsmI.html
20-05-2020||Gurugram||Summer vacation in confinement for city children||From video-calling friends and family to participating in online multiplayer games and workshops, families are turning to technology to keep themselves entertained and engaged during the summer vacation amid the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). In view of the Covid-19 pandemic and Lockdown 4.0, which will be in place till May 31, several families have to skip the yearly ritual of visiting their hometowns or indulging in other outdoor recreational activities during the summer vacation, which has already started in many schools. While some parents said that they were relying on video calls and gaming sessions to bond with relatives in other cities, others said they would utilise the break from online classes conducted by schools to spend more time with children in various activities and chores at home. Tripti Singh, a parent, said that her family can’t visit their hometown for the summer break like they do every year due to the restrictions. To make up for that, her children are relying on frequent video calls to stay in touch with their cousins in different cities. “Since the children were introduced to regular online classes, they are spending more time on gadgets. They chat with their cousins on video calls or play online games such as ludo, which keeps them engaged despite the physical distance,” Singh said.Singh’s daughter Shivranjini Rathor said that summer vacations were usually the time to connect with friends and cousins, but with the lockdown in place, video calls were helping her stay in touch with loved ones. “Video calls with friends and family have increased quite a lot during the lockdown. They help kill time,” Rathor, who also spends time playing online ludo with her cousins, said. “There are many options, but most of my time is spent playing multi-player ludo with people from different places,” the Class 9 student added.Pooja Mihani, another parent, said that the summer vacation usually meant a trip to her hometown in Uttarakhand, but under lockdown conditions, the break this year would be different. “Now our days usually start with a visit to the park. This time, since we are confined to the city, we will be spending time in activities that can be done at home,” Mihani said.She said that her family was keeping children engaged with role-play, household chores, and games such as Pictionary and ludo. “Due to the pandemic, children are already living in a stressed environment. As a family, we are participating in various activities such as cooking or baking together. We are making the most of this time; we may not spend so much of it together again,” Mihani said.Sonal Kaushik, the mother of a Class 9 student, said that her son’s school has a shorter summer break this year, which her son plans to spend at home relaxing and revising the syllabus that had been covered so far. “Every year, we travel to ensure that the children meet their grandparents in UP and Haryana, or plan trips to other locales. Not this year, though,” Kaushik, a professional artist, said. She said that she was planning to engage herself with artwork.Jyoti Raghavan, a mother of two, said that she was contemplating enrolling her children in online workshops to keep them occupied during the summer break. “Every year, during the summer vacation, we travel to new places for around 15 days. For the remaining part of the vacation, we enrol the children in workshops or sports camps. This time, we will be spending the vacation at home,” Raghavan said, adding that she was planning to enrol her children in one of several online courses and workshops to ensure that they are not bored in confinement. “Half their day is spent in online classes right now. During the vacation, children have a lot of free time on their hands. What will they do? We have to enrol them for something. Besides these activities, children have got used to engaging with friends via video calls and, hopefully, that will also keep them occupied,” she said.However, summer vacation is not all fun and games, children are also required to complete holiday homework that they have received from schools. “We have given or students holiday homework so that there is some semblance of a routine in their lives and they keep themselves occupied. The homework doesn’t include a lot of written work and instead focuses on creative activities and hands-on learning. These activities have been designed keeping in mind that children will not be able to move around,” Anshu Arora, principal, Amity International School, Sector 43, said. Other schools have also assigned their students minimal holiday homework.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/summer-vacation-in-confinement-for-city-children/story-u2DiIc5rttrq483u2zDruM.html
20-05-2020||Gurugram||Aarogya Setu mandatory, handshakes prohibited for athletes||The Haryana government released the standard operating procedure (SOP) for sports activities to resume in stadia and complexes on Tuesday evening. According to the guidelines, sports equipment such as helmets, eye and face protectors shall not be shared, a distance of two metres shall be maintained between players during training, handshakes are prohibited, central air conditioning shall be avoided and medical rooms shall be sterilised twice daily when players get back to practice sessions. Meanwhile, sporting events and gathering of spectators continue to remain prohibited. The ministry of home affairs (MHA) had announced a further extension of the nationwide lockdown till May 31 to curb the spread of Covid-19, with certain relaxations in the fourth phase. In an order issued on Sunday, the MHA said sports complexes are allowed to open, clearing the passage for players to resume training which came to a halt in mid-March. Complying with the MHA order, the state government on Tuesday cleared the path for stadiums to reopen with certain norms. The state government has made the Aarogya Setu app mandatory for all athletes and staff. It also added a slew of measures to counter the threat posed by the deadly virus, such as teleconsultation with doctors rather than in-person consults, stringent supervision of athletes’ health, increased sanitation measures, etc.Besides several private academies, players train at the government’s Tau Devi Lal Stadium in the city. Detailed instructions have also been given authorities to sanitise facilities inside sports complexes. “Hand sanitisers shall be made available at the entrance and a notice shall be displayed with guidelines on proper sanitisation process. Foot pedal sanitiser shall be placed at entry point of rooms of officials, medical centre, dining hall/mess and other strategic points throughout the centre (sic),” read the SOP guidelines.According to the guidelines, the trainees and staff should strictly adhere to the social distancing norm of 1.5 to two metres between each individual. “Handshakes and other forms of greetings which need physical contact shall be prohibited (sic),” read the SOP. Personal equipment such as bows, guns, swords, javelins, discus, rackets should not be shared and must be disinfected after every use.Priyanka Thakran, a 23-year-old archer from the city, who bagged two medals, gold as well as silver, in archery at the Khelo India University Games, 2020, said the SOPs are a good initiative for players to get back to training. “In archery, everyone has their own equipment, so the concept of sharing doesn’t exist, but sanitising our bows and arrows regularly is a good step which we will religiously follow,” Thakran said.Coaches in the city have decided to instruct their players that training will take place keeping in mind enough distance from each player. Manoj Sharma, a boxing coach, said, “I have told my players that we will train while maintaining social distance. Also, regular cleaning of boxing gloves will be a necessity for any player who comes to the stadium.”The guidelines also state that the use of masks will be compulsory for players, and training may be performed in small groups of eight to 10 people. “In team events 18 players and two coaches can play for one hour and for individual events not more than 10 players should play at a time (sic),” read the SOP.Strict guidelines concerning the nutrition and diet of players have been released, with an emphasis on placing any package from outside in the sunlight for some time before giving it to the players. “All packed food/fresh fruits etc supplies delivered at centre shall be placed in an open area for a period of 24 hours (cardboard packing) or 72 hours (plastic packing) before usage. Unwrapped items like fruits or vegetables shall be washed under running water immediately after being delivered at centre. Fruits and vegetables may be soaked in diluted vinegar, salt or lemon water for few hours and left to dry prior to consumption (sic),” read the guidelines.Besides these rules and regulations, the state government has made it mandatory for the furniture in medical rooms to be sterilised at least twice daily. Athletes below 18 years of age shall take written confirmation from their parents that they will be responsible if anything happens to them due to the pandemic. All swimming pools shall remain closed in the state.Raj Yadav, the district sports officer, said, “We will abide by the rules and regulations set by the department. Accordingly, sports activities will resume in the city.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/aarogya-setu-mandatory-handshakes-prohibited-for-athletes/story-qYn5VX5b6xUc3uWUM9tZ8N.html

20-05-2020||City||Man arrested for impersonating civil officers||A 21-year-old man was arrested by the Jarcha police on Tuesday for allegedly impersonating civil services officers on social media and duping people.The man was identified as one Ravi Singh of Pratapgarh, who lived in Surajpur, from where he was arrested.According to the police , Ravi specifically impersonated IAS, IPS and IRS officials by creating fake profiles on social media. The police said he would message people who already knew these officials and claim he was in dire financial trouble to dupe them of money.“He was living with a relative and had used his phone to create the fake Facebook profile impersonating an IPS officer. He’d got in touch with the officer’s relatives online and taken money from them. During interrogation, it came to light that he had also made profiles of an IAS officer, an IRS officer and another civil servant. We also found out he had already been jailed in Delhi for impersonating an IPS officer as well as an IRS officer,” Rajesh Kumar Singh, the deputy commissioner of police, Zone 3, said.Ravi has also been arrested in Surajpur and jailed for duping one Surjeet Singh of ₹56,000 by impersonating an IPS officer.“He was released on parole on April 5 because of the ongoing pandemic. He impersonated specific officers, created fake profiles, and then targeted their acquittances for money,” the DCP said.The police said that Ravi has been conning people for the past two years at least. They are verifying how many profiles he created, how many persons he duped and how much money he made, along with how many cases he may be involved in. They said he counted on the fact that people would not ask him the nature of his troubles as he was a government officer.The police have obtained some of his call recordings, though they suspect he has been working alone, and seized two phones from him.The police said Ravi is a Class 12 graduate and had told his family that he works at a call centre.He was booked under sections 463 of the Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of the IT Act. He was produced before a magistrate and later sent to jail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/man-arrested-for-impersonating-civil-officers/story-MV5xet3l0jHSEzEMv71DpM.html
20-05-2020||City||GB Nagar: Parks reopened, G Noida resumes land acquisition work||NOIDA: The two development authorities in Gautam Budh Nagar -- Noida and Greater Noida -- on Wednesday decided to reopen the parks in the district, following the guidelines issued by the Uttar Pradesh government for the fourth phase of lockdown. While the Greater Noida authority is yet to set timings for the parks, the Noida authority has reopened city parks from 7am to 10am and 4pm to 7pm. However, visitors will have to wear mask and follow social distancing norms, officials from both the authorities said. The two authorities had shut down the city parks after the nationwide lockdown imposed on March 25 to contain the spread of Covid-19.The Greater Noida authority has also decided to open its main administrative building in Knowledge Park-IV for visitors and start land acquisition for new industrial projects with an aim to lure manufacturing companies from Japan, China, and Taiwan, among others, under eased guidelines for the Lockdown 4.0, said the authority officials. The Greater Noida authority chief executive officer, Narendra Bhooshan, on Wednesday directed the staff to conduct sanitisation drive in city’s all commercial markets, parks, bus shelters and other public spaces. He also directed the staff to start preparing electronic files instead of traditional paper files to process various routine or big budget projects, including land acquisition from farmers. The authority wants to acquire 1,400 acres of agricultural land via direct buying from farmers in order to ready industrial pockets to be allotted for manufacturing units.“We have directed all project engineers and other staff members to restart land acquisition process via making e-files and following all standard operating procedures. Our office will also reopen for visitors. However, visitors must wear mask and stand in earmarked circles to approach a desk for any work,” said Bhooshan. The authority office, which was closed for visitors after March 25, usually witnesses about 1,000 visitors daily. Now, it will restart its all important jobs that include mortgage permission for builders or individual allottees, map approval, issuance of occupancy certificate for group housing or other buildings, other property related works.The Greater Noida authority will disinfect lifts in its office, door handles, gates and other such points which people generally touch. The disinfection in the office will be done twice in the working hours, the officials said.However, the Noida authority has decided against opening its main administrative office to visitors for now. But the Noida authority has opened city parks to visitors with some riders. It has also asked residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) in respective sectors to ensure that the visitors to the parks obey social distancing norms.“All visitors to the city parks will have to wear a mask and follow social distancing rules. We have asked RWAs to ensure that all social distancing rules are adhered to by visitors,” said Rajeev Tyagi, chief engineer of Noida authority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gb-nagar-parks-reopened-g-noida-resumes-land-acquisition-work/story-OE0HeiNrAVgTLdADkvuZnK.html
20-05-2020||City||Guard at Vivo plant’s construction site tested false positive, being shunned by villagers||Noida: A 38-year-old third-party employee of mobilemaker Vivo India, who was discharged after spending over three days in the isolation ward of the Sharda Hospital while undergoing treatment for Coronavirus (Covid-19) is now facing boycott from villagers. Mahesh and one more colleague from the construction site of Vivo in Greater Noida were found false positive on May 19. The man is a resident of Nawada village in the Dankaur block of Greater Noida and was admitted on May 16 while his mother, wife and two children were kept under institutional quarantine. On May 19, he was found negative for the infection and his reports from a private lab of Gurugram turned out to be false positive.“Villagers are scared to even talk to me and are running away from our family. I have told them multiple times that I am negative and the first report was wrong. I even showed my negative report, but everybody is giving us a weird look. No officer came to remove the barricades from the lane where I live and to inform everybody that my street is not sealed anymore because I was always negative for the infection. I removed the barricades myself,” said Mahesh, who works as a guard at the construction site of the new Vivo manufacturing plant. One of Mahesh’s cow died of hunger as the family was away and nobody fed four of his cattle. “My animals were inside the house and nobody fed them properly as everybody was scared to come close to our house. One of our neighbours threw some dry fodder through the window which helped the remaining three to survive. The surviving cattle are also not keeping well and has stopped giving milk. The mistake of the lab has caused me financial loss too,” said Mahesh.“I want the administration or the concerned lab authorities to compensate the losses I have faced and also the mental stress I have to go through following the behaviour of villagers. I am keeping myself under home quarantine to ensure that nobody faces any problem because of me. The Vivo officials have asked me to write an application mentioning the problems faced by me,” added Mahesh.In a statement released by Vivo officials, the company said: “The company had resumed its manufacturing operations on May 9 at its plant in Greater Noida. The facility continues to abide by all prescribed SOPs to ensure safety and well being of its current 3000 employees (30% of total workforce capacity) that continues to work at the state-of-the-art facility in Gautam Budh Nagar.” “No worker at the Vivo factory has been found Covid positive. However, at the construction site of the new Vivo manufacturing plant, 15 kilometres away from the operational factory and managed by a third-party construction company, two construction workers (third-party employees) were misdiagnosed. Nonetheless, as per the latest lab test reports that came in today, both the workers have been found negative,” it added.Nipun Marya, Director - Brand Strategy, Vivo India, said: “Health and safety of our employees and partners are of paramount importance to us. No vivo employee has tested positive till date and the company are taking all precautionary measures and adhering to all government guidelines.” The district magistrate has asked the local police to ensure that Mahesh doesn’t face any boycott from the villagers. “I have asked concerned officials to look into the matter. We will ensure that the Vivo employee doesn’t face any boycott by the villagers. He is negative and he has every right to live comfortably in his house,” said Suhas LY, district magistrate, GB Nagar.Four new Covid-19 cases in GB NagarThe health department reported four new cases of Covid-19 on Wednesday. The total number of cases has reached 293 in the district. The patients include a 68-year-old man from Sector 78 from the Sunshine Helios society. The patient contracted infection from the earlier patient from the area. A 9-month-old boy who was found positive for the infection was admitted on Tuesday but officials tested him again. He was again found positive after which he was counted in the total number of Covid-19 cases.An 80-year-old man was from Block B of Sector 110 was also found positive for the infection. The man was undergoing treatment at the Yatharth Hospital and it is expected that he contracted infection over there. He was admitted at the Sharda Hospital on Tuesday.A 27-year-old woman from sector 15 was also found positive for the infection.

20-05-2020||City||Migrants wait for buses as political slugfest goes on||Ghaziabad: Even as the Congress and the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh remained locked in an escalating fight over transportation for migrant, hundreds of workers have been reaching Anand Vihar-Kaushambi border in Ghaziabad in the hope of catching a bus to their hometowns. Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra had offered to send 1000 buses for ferrying migrants to their natives in Uttar Pradesh. The UP government had accepted the offer and first asked the Congress to send the buses to Lucknow for necessary inspection, and then tweaked the instructions and asked the party to send 500 buses at each of the state’s border with Delhi in Noida and Ghaziabad.According to the transport officials, no bus has reached its destination point in Ghaziabad or Noida. “We heard that Priyanka Gandhi was sending buses to Ghaziabad so we came here but buses were not available. The cops deployed at the Delhi-Ghaziabad border told us to go away and said that there were no buses. We are still roaming around in hope to getting buses to our home towns,” said Anil Kumar, a migrant worker who had come from Bahadurgarh in Haryana and a native of Rae Bareli in Uttar Pradesh.Like Kumar, Kamla Shankar also came to the border from Kanawani near Indirapuram in hope of getting buses.“My grandfather has passed away and I need to go to my home town in Allahabad. So our group of about 8-10 people came to Kaushambi in hope of getting buses. There was news that 1000 buses were coming to UP so we came here. But there were no buses available,” he added.The Ghaziabad administration has been running bus services to cities in UP from Morta on Delhi-Meerut Road and had decided against running buses from Kaushambi after a major influx of migrant workers in the last week of March at UPSRTC’s Kaushambi depot when the lockdown was announced.The officials of state-run UP State Road Transport Corporation (UPSRTC) said they have ferried about 50,000 migrant workers to different cities in UP in the past one week.“We have been running about 200 buses per day to ferry migrant workers to their home towns in UP such as Jhansi, Balia and Gorakhpur. Nowadays the frequency of buses has come down to 75-80 buses per day as train services has also started from Ghaziabad. Earlier, we had about 400 UPSRTC buses in Ghaziabad and now we have received 100 more buses,” said AK Singh, regional manager, UPSRTC.He said the current fleet strength of UPSRTC buses is enough to ferry migrant workers.“Even if the (Congress’) buses arrive, we already have sufficient buses with us to cater to migrant workers. The number of those coming in seeking transport has also reduced after the state government pressed in trains. We estimate that the number of incoming migrant workers will also get reduced in another week. Migrant workers arrived at the border and the police were making regular announcements.They told workers that no buses were available and requested them to go back,” he added.Since May 15, the Ghaziabad administration has been catering to migrant workers from UP and Bihar as three trains each per day to the cities in two states have been leaving from Ghaziabad railway station.According to officials, a train each is ferrying an average of about 1200-1400 passengers per day.“Our officials were present till the late night on Tuesday at Ramlila Ground in Indirapuram and also at Sahibabad in case any of the 1000 buses sent by the Congress reaches Ghaziabad. But no buses have come so far and we are waiting for directions,” said RR Soni, regional transport officer.The Anand Vihar-Kaushambi border has already been sealed by the Ghaziabad administration.Awanish Awasthi, UP’s additional chief secretary, had said on Tuesday that UP CM has directed for 100% utilisation of entire fleet of about 12,000-odd UPSRTC buses.“We have about 2 lakh workers who are coming to UP each day from buses and trains from different states. We have about 1,044 trains which have come in or are in the process of reaching UP. The fleet of about 12000 UPSRTC buses has also been roped in for ferrying migrant workers. Each district has been given permission to run at least 200 buses and no migrant workers will have to walk to his home,” he said on Wednesday.“We have increased trains and buses in past couple of days. They are in operation from Ghaziabad, Noida, Saharanpur, Jhansi, Mathura, Prayagraj, Kanpur, Moradabad and being sent to different cities,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/migrants-wait-for-buses-as-political-slugfest-goes-on/story-z9zAyWHCBcStHWLMva1UhJ.html
20-05-2020||Delhi||North municipality teachers launch ‘symbolic protest’ against non-payment of salaries||Around 3,500 North Delhi Municipal Corporation teachers — who are currently engaged by the Delhi government in dry ration/food distribution duty, quarantine centres and for survey work — have launched a protest against non-payment of salaries..The “symbolic protest”, in which the teachers are wearing black bands and black outfits, was launched on May 16 and is against non-payment of salaries for the past two months , March and April. The north corporation, in total, employs 7,500 teachers, and their total salary bill comes to Rs 64 crore per month, officials said.The north body’s standing committee chairperson, Jai Prakash, said, “We pay our teachers, sanitation workers, doctors, nurses, domestic mosquito breeding checkers (DBCs) and other staff from the money that comes from the Delhi Government under the ‘Plan Head’ annually. Last financial year (2019-20), we got ₹1,850 crore for the year under this head, and ₹568 crore of it was paid to us in the first quarter (April).”“This year, however, we have got only ₹ 222 crore, which is Rs. 346 crore less. We are struggling and have already written in this regard to the chief Minister and held a meeting with Lieutenant Governor, Anil Baijal, on this issue. But we have not got any response from the Delhi government so far,” he said.Ira Singhal, the north body spokesperson, said, “We cannot pay these people from our own funds because our internal sources of revenue — house tax, parking, advertisement, toll tax, community hall bookings — have all dried up because of the lockdown.”The Delhi government refused to comment on the issue.Meanwhile, teachers said that they have been suffering for no fault of their own.“I have been working in north municipality schools since 1998. We never faced a problem of delayed salaries before. But for the past six years now, we teachers are getting paid only once in three months said Kiran Sardana, who teaches in a north municipality school in Kishan Vihar. “Before COVID, we would at least borrow money from lenders, shopkeepers, etc., but now, due to lockdown, no one is willing to oblige. I have EMIs to pay on a flat I purchased. Plus, there are elderly parents at home with health problems and medical bills, and children, whose school fee need to be paid,” said Balwan Singh, another north corporation teacher.The municipality teachers’ union said that they are currently engaged on COVID pandemic duties under the Disaster Management Act, and thereby cannot hold dharna (demonstration) or stop work, which, otherwise, makes them liable to arrest and legal action.“Therefore, we are only showing our disappointment and anguish wearing these black bands. However, we are constantly writing to the Delhi Government, Prime Minister’s Office, Ministry of Home Affairs and Finance through Twitter and e-mails. While we are sincerely discharging all our duties, including teaching at this time, the authorities must understand that we also have families,” said Ramnivas Solanki, General Secretary of the municipal teachers association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/north-municipality-teachers-launch-symbolic-protest-against-non-payment-of-salaries/story-WAgdh0TgHxynojxQBinOTP.html
20-05-2020||City||Ghaziabad framing plan for opening markets||The opening of markets in Ghaziabad will take a couple of days as officials are considering various models under which shops can be opened while ensuring crowd control and social distancing.District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said during the meeting with market association members, various models for opening markets were put forward and the district officials have been asked to draw up a plan accordingly.“We are considering various models -- opening different markets in a staggered manner; an odd-even plan for shops or even a left-side, right-side plan for shops. I have asked officials to draw up a plan so that everything is put in place to minimise huge gatherings,” Pandey said.“Initially we would ask the traders to thoroughly sanitise their shops. Our local agencies will also ensure that market areas are properly cleaned and sanitised,” he said.Pandey said the commuting to Delhi will continue to be restricted. “The interdistrict movement may be allowed to Noida and Greater Noida. But we will have to seek state government’s directions for opening the borders with Delhi,” he said.The state officials have already sought a list of containment zones and Red zones in Ghaziabad district and a list is being finalised by the chief medical officer.“The administration officials are presently dealing with the task of sending migrant workers back to their home towns. Any opening of markets will also attract thousands of people on a daily basis. So a balance has to be maintained while opening shops,” a district administration official, on condition of anonymity, said.Officials said that the guidelines are likely to be finalised by May 21. Under the fourth phase of the nationwide lockdown, which kicked in on May 18 and will continue till May 31, the Centre had allowed states to decide on restrictions and zoning of areas based on Covid prevalence.On May 1, the Ghaziabad district moved out of red zone to orange as per the classification by of the Union health ministry. Among certain restrictions, the night-time curfew between 7pm and 7am is still applicable.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-framing-plan-for-opening-markets/story-pApZ87yefwoRGFqc3yVAlL.html
20-05-2020||Noida||Noida admin introduces odd-even system for opening shops||The Gautam Budh Nagar district administration Wednesday issued an advisory on opening markets in the different localities and said shops will have to follow an odd-even system for remaining open, similar to the pan adopted in Delhi.According to the advisory issued by district magistrate Suhas LY, all shopkeepers will have to follow safety norms, to stop any further spread of the Covid-19.Additional commissioner of commercial tax (Noida division) Vinay Kumar said according to the guidelines of the ministry of home affairs (MHA) and the state government, all shops in rural and urban areas, except those in containment zones, have been given the permission to operate. “Since maintaining social distancing is a must in a pandemic situation, the shopkeepers of different areas have been asked to follow the odd-even scheme strictly. It will not only reduce crowding in markets, but will also help in maintaining social distancing,” he said.The odd-even scheme for shops follows the same principle of the road rationing scheme whereby shops with even numbers will open on Monday, Wednesday and Friday and odd-numbered ones will open on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. This will ensure that on any given day, only half the shops in a market will remain open. Even shops in Delhi are currently following this scheme. Kumar said it has been made mandatory for all the shopkeepers and staff, to use masks, gloves, hand-wash and sanitisers. “They have also been asked not to entertain any customer who comes to their shops without masks on. None of the shops, except those selling essential commodities, will remain open after 7pm,” he said. Sushil Kumar Jain, the convener of Delhi-NCR chapter of Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), said the shops with even numbers in their addresses will open on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. “Similarly, the shops with odd numbers will be opened on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. On Sunday, it is mandatory for all shops to carry out thorough sanitisation, and will be closed to customers,” he said.He said shopkeepers have agreed to follow the new regulations. “Everyone from our fraternity is hopeful that with recommencement of business activities, the markets will be ‘atma nirbhar (self-reliant)’. They have also been asked to give an undertaking in this regard, to the police stations concerned,” Jain said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-admin-introduces-odd-even-system-for-opening-shops/story-jDaylB69N2rZLxJ9tY7FMI.html
20-05-2020||City||Revised guidelines help Gzb authorities discharge 55 patients in three days||The district health department officials Wednesday said that they have been able to discharge 55 patients afflicted with the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in the past three days (since Sunday).According to them, the district on Wednesday recorded five more Covid-19 cases, taking the total number of cases to 196.“Five positive cases were reported on Wednesday, while six patients were discharged. With this, the total number of active cases in the district is 33, with 161 out of 196 discharged so far. Two of the five cases are from Khoda Colony while three are from sectors 1, 3 and 15 at Vasundhara,” Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer, said.The health department officials confirmed that the tally of discharged patients stood at 161, against the number of total cases, which stood at 196 till Wednesday. A closer look revealed that the number of discharges has increased due to the revised discharge guidelines received by the district health department from the state officials.According to the district officials, a Covid-19 patient earlier needed two successive negative reports to be discharged from the hospital. This, they said, was time-consuming, and the lag in obtaining test results further delayed their discharge.“As per the revised discharge guidelines, we are now discharging asymptomatic patients if their first report is negative. Patients with mild/moderate or severe Covid-19 symptoms such as fever, cough, etc. are also getting discharged after a single negative report. However, such patients must remain asymptomatic for three consecutive days before they can be discharged,” Dr Gupta said.He said that discharged patients are now quarantined at home for seven days as against 14 days as per earlier norms.“Most positive cases in Ghaziabad are showing mild symptoms. So as per revised guidelines, we have been able to discharge about 55 patients in the last three days. Therefore, the number of patients being discharged is on the higher side in our district. Otherwise, we were discharging only 50% of the cases. Earlier, when we were required to get two successive negative reports, we had to face a delay of about six days between receiving the results of both the tests,” the CMO added.He added that some samples are now also sent to the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Delhi, and test reports are received within 15 to 16 hours.In another move, the health department has also been directed to chalk out a list of containment zones as well as red zones within the Ghaziabad district.“State officials have asked us whether some areas need to be demarcated as containment zones or red zones. So, we are now compiling a list of certain areas where cases are clustered and need to be contained for 14 or more days. In case no more cases are reported from these areas, they will be removed from the list of containment or red zones. The entire district is already classified as an orange zone as per the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare,” Dr Gupta added.Officials said they have started compiling a list of such areas. Under the guidelines released for Lockdown 4.0, several activities are not allowed in containment zones.“The potential areas that we can think of are parts of Khoda, Loni, Vasundhara, Jhandapur, Islam Nagar and Dasna Gate among others. Once finalised, the list will be sent to the UP officials,” Dr Gupta added.According to the latest list available with the health department, Ghaziabad has 50 different areas listed under Category 1 and 18 areas listed under Category 2 of containment zones.Category 1 areas are defined as those which have reported just one case (they have a perimeter of about 400 metres) and Category 2 areas are defines as those with more than one positive case (they have a perimeter of one kilometre).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/revised-guidelines-help-gzb-authorities-discharge-55-patients-in-three-days/story-FGxFjripiIiOuqB9ODLmVK.html

Till May 19, about 6.10 lakh migrants/people had reached state through 427 special / Shramik Special trains and buses. This means that Bihar, by May-end, would will received 15.28 lakh migrants/people,” IPRD secretary Anupam Kumar said. “This is the biggest ever evacuation drive,” said an official.Officials of East Central Railway, of which Bihar is a major part, say that though the arrival of migrants is less than the average footfall of passenger per day, it is quite huge.“Before the lockdown started, on March 23, a total of approximately 7.76 lakh passengers travelled by 165 pairs of mail/express trains either originating or passing through Bihar. Similarly 388 passenger trains also of which 108 run in Bihar alone,” said chief public relation officer (CPRO), ECR, Rajesh Kumar.In addition to this, the state government is also running 4,500 buses to ferry migrants from one destination to other.Railway sources said that most of these trains are running to full capacity. “Earlier, of the 72 berths sleeper coaches 54 passengers were travelling as we were not allowing use of middle coaches. Similarly, in LHB coaches, only 60 passengers were allowed in an 80 berth coaches. But now seats are being utilized,” said the CPRO, raising questions over social distancing.An alarmed Bihar government is gearing up to face the rising number of cases of Covid-19 in the state, especially after trainloads of mostly asymptomatic migrant labourers came back and many of them tested positive. The state government has set up 7,840 block quarantine centres in which 5.45 lakh migrants are staying, said the IPRD secretary. “In addition to this, 76,500 people are also living in 151 disaster relief centres being run by disaster management department,” he said.Chief minister Nitish Kumar has already directed officials to do random testing in districts and strengthen isolation wards at the block level with more beds and facilities, as the number is set to grow.The focus has now shifted to the panchayat and block levels, as it is where the migrants will spend their mandatory 14 days at the isolation centres.Date Trains No of passengersMay 20 70 1.12 lakhMay 21 77 1.23 lakhMay 22 70 1.12 lakhMay 23 74 1.18 lakhMay 24 68 1.08 lakhMay 25 54 86,400May 26 52 83,200May 27 47 75,200May 28 62 99,200||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/70-trains-brings-1-12-lakh-migrants-in-a-day-in-bihar/story-WgolrUwvrlCCtoA8t8KcOI.html
20-05-2020||City||GB Nagar admin clarifies guidelines as residents raise concerns||Noida: The Gautam Budh Nagar administration on Wednesday afternoon released clarifications to the guidelines issued by it for the fourth phase of the lockdown.The move comes soon after some residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) complained that certain key issues like movement of domestic helps and maintenance staff have not been addressed. The district administration had released fresh guidelines on Wednesday morning.The guidelines have allowed the public transport and street vendors and e-commerce to operate. Besides, markets and industries can resume their operations.The clarifications released later say that any activity which is not prohibited is treated as permitted and service personnel such as maids, drivers and electricians are allowed, except for any movement in or out of containment zones and within them. “Consent of both the house resident and service personnel is must. RWAs can only impose restrictions to the extent of enforcing guidelines like wearing masks or sanitisation, etc. RWAs can set up internal system to regulate number of people entering the lift or social distancing and they have to balance community hygiene with convenience of individual residents,” said an order from the district administration.During the third phase of the lockdown, the district administration had asked the local RWAs to come up with solutions to problems like entry of domestic helps or maintenance staff in consensus with the residents. “In the absence of clear guidelines, it becomes a problem for the RWAs. If we come up with any decision without administrative backing, there is a huge risk of opposition from the residents,” said KK Jain, secretary general, Federation of Noida Residents’ Welfare Associations.The fresh guidelines also prohibit cross border travel to Delhi. However, residents are facing problems because of it as several people have to travel from Noida to Delhi or vice versa for professional commitments.“More than that, sometimes close relatives have to see each other and businesses have to run. Residential bodies are in no position to take all decisions specially if there is no backing from the administration,” said Colonel (retired) Shashi Vaid, chairman, Arun Vihar RWA.A senior police officials said that in case of RWAs do not act in accordance with administration guidelines and interest of the residents, action can be taken against them though people are advised to sort out internal matters amicably.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gb-nagar-admin-clarifies-guidelines-as-residents-raise-concerns/story-IPt4i8X4OkFXv4iHzARFxM.html

20-05-2020||Delhi||First time since May 4, two South Delhi areas sealed||The Delhi government has sealed two more areas — parts of F block in Dakshinpuri and a lane in Zamrudpur village near Greater Kailash — in south Delhi as containment zones, taking the total of such zones to 69, senior officials said on Wednesday. An official said that three more containment zones are likely to be notified by Thursday.District magistrate (south), BM Mishra, said, “These areas were sealed on Tuesday after cluster cases were recorded.”These are the first and second additions to the list of containment zones since May 4, when the third phase of the lockdown started with a few relaxations.Despite the number of Covid-19 cases increasing from 4,549 on May 4 to 10,554 on May 19, when the orders pertaining to the two containment zones were issued by the district administration, containment measures were scaled down in at least 25 sealed zones, as per government records.On Tuesday, Delhi’s health secretary, Padmini Singla, sent letters to all district magistrates, red-flagging the fact that the number of containment zones was going down even as Covid-19 cases in the city continued to rise exponentially.An order issued by Singla on Tuesday directed the district magistrates to reconsider fresh assessment of Covid-19 cases in their revenue districts and create containment zones “as per guidelines” of the Union health ministry, if needed.The Delhi government on Wednesday directed all district health officials to come up with a plan on categorising wards within the 11 revenue districts as red, orange and green, a senior official in the health department said on Wednesday. The official said the exercise is aimed at helping the government on re-assessment of restrictions and relaxations in the light of spike in the number of Covid-19 cases in the last two weeks.On Wednesday, the north district administration also demarcated a larger buffer area around the existing containment zone in Jahangirpuri, senior government officials said.The current relaxations in the fourth phase of the lockdown are not applicable to the containment zones.The Delhi government on Wednesday directed all district health officials to come up with a plan on categorising wards within the 11 revenue districts as Red, Orange and Green, a senior official in the health department said on Wednesday.The official further said, the exercise is aimed at helping the government on re-assessment of restrictions and relaxations in the light of spike in the number of Covid-19 cases in the last two weeks.Currently, the central government under its new guidelines issued on May 17 for the fourth phase of the ongoing nationwide lockdown allows states to demarcate Red, Orange and Green zones on their own.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/two-areas-sealed-in-a-first-since-may-4/story-QavDTFNC3j94ibY33GJ5zH.html

At 8am daily, I drive to the fields carrying breakfast for my brother, Ashok Kumar, and labourers who are preparing the land for sowing paddy. I don’t touch the food as one of my family members puts it on the backseat of the car.”“I preferred not to meet my relatives, friends or the villagers to avoid any complication. I even didn’t go to the village gurdwara after being cured. I don’t want to get infected by the virus again,” says Gurdeep who worked in a packaging unit in Italy where he migrated in 2008.Gurdeep says he sees his brother and the labourers working in the fields from a distance and he also does some works like cutting grass.He returns home at 2pm and takes rest in his room. “In the evening, I browse the internet to learn more about precautions on how to save oneself from the virus. My friends also keep sending me updates from Italy,” he says.Besides, he has been checking updates on the pandemic situation in Italy. “Ultimately, I have to find out what I will do there as I have nothing much to do in India,” he adds.Whether he faced any social stigma after testing positive, he says, “On a personal note, I didn’t face such thing. Villagers greet me well when I go to or come back from the fields. My friends acknowledge me with a smile and warmth when I wave at them from my car,” he claims.Gurdeep says it was a really difficult time for him in Italy where the pandemic situation was worse. “It’s a disease that can infect anyone. We should defeat it with positivity and a good food,” he maintains.“I am shocked to see on television heavy rush of people in the markets. People should understand the gravity of the pandemic. We should religiously follow the social-distancing norms and other precautions,” he cautions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/waiting-for-flight-resumption-to-return-to-italy-says-punjab-s-first-covid-patient/story-WaFNtLGMRTahuKr2DwDjBO.html
20-05-2020||Lucknow||UP calls buses unfit, Priyanka says will ‘send them back’||With Uttar Pradesh deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma asserting that the state government cannot play with the lives of migrant labourers by allowing ‘unfit’ buses to transport them, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra responded by saying “we will send them back” from UP’s borders with Rajasthan on Wednesday “if you don’t want to use them.”Sharma called the Congress list of buses fake, a charge that another senior UP minister had made on Tuesday.Sharma also said, “How can we take theses private buses mentioned in the Congress list? It’s fake, 460 on the list do not have requisite fitness. How can we deploy them? The state government cannot play with the lives of migrant labourers by using unfit buses. The state government is duty bound to ensure a safe journey to the migrant workers.”For its part, the Congress claimed about 900 buses had remained stranded on the border for 24 hours. The decision to send the buses back appears to have ended the party’s faceoff with the state government over offering 1,000 buses to carry migrant labourers back to their homes.In her address on the social media, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said, “If you don’t want to use them, it doesn’t matter. We will send them back. We had sent them back three days ago too. We will continue to help the migrant labourers and other people affected by the lockdown enforced following the pandemic. It doesn’t matter whether these are our buses or yours. We only wanted to help to serve the people.”“I want to request the chief minister our buses are there on the borders till 4pm. Do permit us to run these buses to help the migrants,” said Priyanka before withdrawal of the buses.“We will complete 24 hours at 4pm. Use them, if you want to. If you want to put on BJP flags or BJP stickers on them, do so. If you want to claim these are your buses do so. But allow these buses to run. How long we will continue to indulge in political issues?” she said.On the state government’s objections to fitness of some of the buses, Priyanka said, “We don’t want to raise any questions to the state government. If there are any numbers that have been found incorrect, we can give them a new list.”She, however, said the time wasted in pointing fingers at the Congress list could have been used in using the buses to transport migrant workers.“I want to say that on May 16-17, we made 500 buses available on the Ghaziabad borders. If these buses had been allowed to run, about 20,000 persons could have reached their homes. On Tuesday, we provided 900 buses. These included about 500 buses on the UP-Rajasthan borders and more than 300 buses remained present on the Delhi-Ghaziabad borders. About 36,000 migrant workers would have reached their home on Tuesday if these buses had been allowed to run. Another 36,000 would have reached their home safe on Wednesday. By now, 92,000 migrant labourers would have been transported… But we continued to indulge in political issues,” she said.“I want to tell our migrant brothers and sisters that each and every worker and leader of the Congress is with you. You will find our workers in every district on the way to provide food and water or look into other problems of yours. We will continue to help you with all our capability in this hour of crisis,” she added.Earlier in the day, UP deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma said the videos of buses being circulated by the Congress showed that the buses belonged to the Rajasthan government’s road transport corporation. “How can a political party use government buses?” he asked.“Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot did not take care of students of Kota. (UP) Chief minister Yogi Adityanath deployed buses to bring them back from Rajasthan… The Rajasthan chief minister even appreciated UP government’s move,” said Sharma, while demanding that the Congress should tender an unconditional apology for committing “fraud” on the issue of providing buses.Late Tuesday evening, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s private secretary Sandip Singh had sent another letter to additional chief secretary, home, Awanish Kumar Awasthi.In the letter (sent via email), Sandip Singh said, “Police misbehaved with Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee (UPCC) president Ajay Kumar Lallu and arrested him. We made it clear in our letters that our main objective is to help the migrant labourers. We remained on the UP border with all the buses on Tuesday. But we did not get any response from you. With this letter (sent on email) we want to inform you that we are still there and will remain till 4pm on Wednesday.”Senior UP Congress leader Pankaj Malik said, “We continued to wait at DND flyover with about 500 buses on Wednesday. Other buses remained at UP’s border with Rajasthan. We have shifted our buses from the Delhi border as the police have begun seizure of the vehicles. We want to help the migrant labourers. They may have found a problem with some of the buses mentioned in the Congress list. But the state government could have easily allowed the remaining buses to carry the migrant labourers.”WHAT UP GOVERNMENT CLAIMSOver 1000 Shramik Special trains carrying 16 lakh migrant labourers have arrived.27,000 buses have been deployed to carry the migrant labourers. These include 12,000 UPSRTC buses and 15,000 buses kept at the disposal of district magistrates (200 in 75 districts).The Congress wasted the government’s precious time by giving a fake list. The UP government is duty bound to ensure safety of migrant workers.WHAT CONGRESS CLAIMSWe gave a list of 1,000 buses and 900 of them remained stranded on the UP-Rajasthan and UP-Delhi borders.It doesn’t matter. The state government can use BJP flags or stickersUP government has wasted precious time. If the state government had used these buses, 92,000 migrant labourers would have been transported in the past two days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-calls-buses-unfit-priyanka-says-will-send-them-back/story-M1J7V6rkMbi6W0XmM3YL3N.html

The volunteers are not only helping cops in implementation of lockdown but are also raising awareness among people to fight the pandemic.Earlier too, civil defence volunteers had played important roles not only during Kumbh but had also assisted cops in maintaining law and order on different occasions in Prayagraj. Soon after the lockdown was announced, the civil defence volunteers were assigned their duties under their respective divisions.The volunteers were not only deployed at different checkpoints in the city but also at quarantine centers and other places, said deputy chief warden of civil defence in Prayagraj Sadiq Husain Siddiqui.At present, over 500 civil defence volunteers including around 50 women are extending cooperation to the administration at different checkpoints and quarantine centers in Prayagraj city which is divided in five divisions headed by as many divisional commandants. “Besides their duties at checkpoints, our volunteers are also continuously engaged in raising awareness to remain safe from the pandemic in different localities of the city including in densely populated areas where people are less aware or are reluctant to follow guidelines issued by the government,” Siddiqui further said.Divisional commandant of Naini area Rama Singh said facing all odds and threats, civil defence volunteers were discharging their duties with enthusiasm while coordinating with local policemen and administrative officials. Civil defence volunteers played an important role in enforcing lockdown in Lukarganj area where people were scared after death of a coronavirus patient, said divisional commandant of Lukarganj area Rajeev Bhanot. The volunteers even provided eatables to poor and needy and helped cops in community policing for better implementation of guidelines during the lockdown, Bhanot further said.Civil Defence volunteers were recently felicitated by the administration for their distinguished services, informed deputy chief warden Sadiq Husain Siddiqui.“Civil defence volunteers have been playing an important role on different occasions and have helped in the maintenance of public order,” ADG Zone Prayagraj Prem Prakash said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/civil-defence-volunteers-at-forefront-in-fight-against-corona-in-prayagraj/story-3ndLYFhexZzXsaVdsZFaxH.html

According to forest officials, the incident took place in the Kirangisarra area towards the eastern end of PTR where the two accused were caught cooking the dead animal in a pot.The two accused, Radheshyam Ahake and Kavadu Dhurve, were arrested by the forest department. “It is shocking that Ahake, being the chairman of the village development committee, is involved in such practices. These offenders are under the impression that during the lockdown, forest patrolling staff is not functional but it is quite the opposite,” said Ravikiran Govekar, field director, PTR.“The duo was trying to cook the animal to remove its scales, a precious commodity in the illegal wildlife market. They have been charged under relevant sections of the Indian Forest Act, 1927, and the Wildlife Conservation Act, 1972.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/2-arrested-for-hunting-pangolin-inside-pench-tiger-reserve/story-vb1JATS5YmzlCO7MSBBj4H.html
20-05-2020||Noida||Noida follows Delhi, adopts odd-even system for opening shops||The Gautam Budh Nagar district administration took a leaf out of Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s book as it issued an advisory on opening markets in the different localities and said shops will have to follow an odd-even system to open like the one in the national capital.According to the advisory issued by district magistrate Suhas LY, all shopkeepers will have to follow safety norms, to stop any further spread of the Covid-19.Additional commissioner of commercial tax (Noida division) Vinay Kumar said according to the guidelines of the ministry of home affairs (MHA) and the state government, all shops in rural and urban areas, except those in containment zones, have been given the permission to operate.“Since maintaining social distancing is a must in a pandemic situation, the shopkeepers of different areas have been asked to follow the odd-even scheme strictly. It will not only reduce crowding in markets, but will also help in maintaining social distancing,” he said.The odd-even scheme for shops follows the same principle of the road rationing scheme whereby shops with even numbers will open on Monday, Wednesday and Friday and odd-numbered ones will open on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. This will ensure that on any given day, only half the shops in a market will remain open.Shops in Delhi are currently following this scheme.Kumar said it has been made mandatory for all the shopkeepers and staff, to use masks, gloves, hand-wash and sanitisers.“They have also been asked not to entertain any customer who comes to their shops without masks. None of the shops, except those selling essential commodities, will remain open after 7pm,” he said.Sushil Kumar Jain, the convener of Delhi-NCR chapter of Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), said the shops with even numbers in their addresses will open on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. “Similarly, the shops with odd numbers will be opened on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. On Sunday, it is mandatory for all shops to carry out thorough sanitisation, and will be closed to customers,” he said.He said shopkeepers have agreed to follow the new regulations. “Everyone from our fraternity is hopeful that with recommencement of business activities, the markets will be ‘atma nirbhar (self-reliant)’. They have also been asked to give an undertaking in this regard, to the police stations concerned,” Jain said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-follows-delhi-adopts-odd-even-system-for-opening-shops/story-nPRfl0UgvqTEsM3ud0IpZL.html

20-05-2020||City||Residential societies set guidelines for domestic help||PUNE Lack of clarity from Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) on maids has left many residential societies to set their own rules and regulations.Santosh Krishna, a resident of Wagholi, said, “I think the civic body has left the decision to housing societies to allow domestic helpers to resume work. A formal order from resident welfare associations or local governing body would have made things clear.”“We are taking a very protective approach because of the virus spread and will take a call later,” said Krishna.Several housing societies held online meetings to draft policies regarding maids and other domestic helpers. “At Sahil Sarene, we are also keeping PMC in the loop via online,” said Ameya Karambelkar a resident of Baner.While some felt that the onus of safety of its residents lies with the management, but lack of clarity on the issue is making it difficult to take a decision. “There are genuine requests for maids from senior citizens, patients, pregnant women, nursing mothers and working women. So, clarity from authorities on the issue in a must,” said Mehzabin Saiyed, secretary, Nyati Empire, Kharadi.“The domestic helpers in our society are not coming as of now. While some members of the society want to call back their maids, others are against because of health reasons” said Nitin Memane, a resident of Gera Emerald City North, Kharadi, adding that members are paying maids at least half salary.In Balewadi, some societies are collecting personal details of maids and ensuring that they belong from green zone. Other criteria include the helpers should either walk to work or use their personal vehicle (no public transport), should have stayed in Pune address for 15 days and should not be unwell.“We have advised people to start with one domestic helper, but many members are hesitant to call them,” said Sangeeta Baheti, a resident of Balewadi.Nandan Prospera, a residential society in Baner, has allowed a few domestic helpers to resume work from June 1, but only to houses that genuinely need their services. The housing committee has made resident employers responsible for ensuring that the maids follow all preventive criteria set by the government. The domestic helps will be issued an ID card only after the health safety measures are met.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/residential-societies-set-guidelines-for-domestic-help/story-TzaK0TkH2FCtT2lyx43FXI.html

20-05-2020||City||Cab services resume but find few takers in Ludhiana||Though cab services finally resumed in the district following the lifting of curfew by the state government, the fear of catching an infection inside the vehicle kept most passengers away. While cabs plying within the city managed to find a few takers, there was almost zero demand for inter-district travel. Punjab taxi union president Jaideep Singh said the taxi business has been hit badly as residents are keen on hiring the cab services due to fear of infection. “Earlier, passengers would hire taxis to take them to the Golden Temple in Amritisar, Chandigarh airport or Delhi. But now with residents restricting their movement, we are hardly getting any passengers. Further, as the government has started bus services at cheaper rates for migrants, there are no takers for cabs.” Inter-state taxi drivers say that usually in summers, they made handsome profits as residents would take a trip to the hills to beat the heat. But this time, they aren’t expecting much business.Amanjot Singh, who works with a private cab aggregator, said, “Cab services resumed on May 18 and I waited for two days, but no passengers came forward. Earlier, I used to get at least 8-10 bookings a day.” “We used to get most of our business from students or young professions who came to the city from outside. But now that most students have left for their homes and professions are working from home, there are no takers for cabs,” says Singh, adding, “On our part, we have taken adequate precautions like keeping hand sanitisers inside our vehicles but the response is very low.”Meanwhile residents, who used to travel in local cabs, are now preferring their own vehicles. Ravi Arora, a resident of BRS Nagar, said, “Due to shortage of parking space near my shop in Mochpura Bazar, I used to take a cab to work but now I go in my own car as I don’t want to take any risk.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cab-services-resume-but-find-few-takers-in-ludhiana/story-3BGFqReXlSn9VZoTobmgQJ.html

This is after the Shimla district administration decided to relax curfew for eight hours. The coffee house witnessed good business on Wednesday as it did sales of more than Rs 3,000.Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, like other businesses, ICH was also closed, resulting in heavy losses. It is one of the most popular restaurants in Shimla, and on Wednesday, people were seen enjoying coffee on nearby benches.Manager Bhagat Sharma said, “Coffee and dosa are available as of now but other items are available in limited quantity. The rates of items remain the same. People have been demanding to be allowed to sit inside the coffee house while maintaining social distancing as they are missing the ambience of the place. But we cannot allow that in the present scenario.”“It was great to be able to enjoy their coffee after such a long time. I used to visit here frequently with my friends and we are waiting for things to get back to normal so that we can once again enjoy hanging out here,” said Surinder Thakur, a local.Built in 1957, the Indian Coffee House has been popular amongst tourists as well as locals.

20-05-2020||Kolkata||Cyclone Amphan batters Bengal, Odisha as 6.5 lakh evacuated, 2 dead||An extremely severe cyclone packing winds of up to 190 kmph roared into West Bengal Wednesday, dumping heavy rain and leaving a trail of destruction that left at least two people dead, officials said. After making landfall at 2.30 p.m. between Digha in West Bengal and and Hatiya island in Bangladesh, cyclone Amphan cut a swathe through the coastal areas, flattening fragile dwellings, uprooting trees and electric poles. At least 6.58 lakh people were evacuated in West Bengal and Odisha before the cyclone struck. “The forward sector of the wall cloud region is entering into land in West Bengal. The intensity of the cyclone near its centre as the landfall process started was recorded at 160-170 kmph, gusting to 190 kmph,” the weather department said.ALSO WATCH Cyclone Amphan: ‘41 teams on ground in Odisha, Bengal,’ says NDRF chief  Two women were killed in Howrah district and Minakhan area of North 24 Parganas district due to uprooting of trees, an official said. NDRF chief S N Pradhan told a press conference in New Delhi that 20 teams of the federal disaster response force had already begun road clearing operations in Odisha, while the 19 units deployed in West Bengal were shifting people to safety. Quoting figures made available by the two states, Pradhan said over 5 lakh people were evacuated in West Bengal and more than 1.58 lakh in Odisha. TV footage showed gigantic tidal waves crashing into a seawall in Digha, close to the landfall site. Thick sheets of rain blurred the vast coastline in the two states and surging waters engulfed mud-and-thatch houses, flattening them in a trice. Heavy machinery was moved in to clear the roads blocked by falling trees. India Meteorological Department (IMD) Director General Mrityunjay Mohapatra, who jointly addressed the media with Pradhan, said gale-strength winds speeding at 160-170 kmph were pounding South and North 24 Parganas and East Midnapore districts and could be gusting up to 185 kmph. He said the eye of the monster cyclone, the most explosive part of the cyclonic system, had touched the land, triggering copious rain in the three districts. The eye of the storm itself was 30 km in diameter, he said. Mohapatra said the intensity of the rain and winds accompanying it could deceptively look like ebbing away briefly, but will surge afresh once the rear sector of the storm has reached the landmass. The whole cyclonic system will have reached the land by 7 pm, he said. Reports arriving in Kolkata from North and South 24 Parganas and East Midnapore said roofs of thatched houses were blown away, and twisted electric poles and broken and uprooted trees bore testimony to the devastation. Streets and homes in low lying areas of Kolkata were swamped with rainwater. Mohapatra said the storm will reach Kolkata in all its fury later in the evening and winds blowing at 110-120 kmph, and gusting at 135 kmph, coupled with downpour, will batter the capital city. Despite losing its force a bit since Tuesday, the storm, which was categorised as super cyclone at one point of time, has left the two eastern states on edge as it hollered on its destructive path over the Bay of Bengal. Intense rainfall was recorded in several areas of Puri, Khurda, Jagatsinghpur, Cuttack, Kendrapara, Jajpur, Ganjam, Ganjam, Bhadrak and Balasore districts since Tuesday. The rains and high-velocity winds will ebb away in Odisha by late Wednesday night by when the cyclone will likely have caused massive damage to standing crops, plantations and infrastructure, Mohapatra said. He said tidal surge of up to five metres could occur in North and South 24 Parganas and East Midnapore districts that could submerge areas in a radius of 15 km. The strong winds and rain could continue till tomorrow in West Bengal, he said. The turbulence will likely extend to Assam and Meghalaya, triggering heavy to very heavy rain on Thursday. Mohapatra said since the time the depression formed over the Bay of Bengal on May 20 till the cyclone made the landfall, the IMDs predictions about the path it will take and the timing was accurate and helped the disaster response machinery strategise and execute the plans to minimise the damage effectively. The cyclonic storm will get weaker while crossing over Nadia and Murshidabad in West Bengal later tonight before entering Bangladesh as a deep depression and dissipating.

The accused also kicked the victim, causing his spleen and kidneys to burst.The victim managed to film the attack with his mobile phone, which was then used as proof by the police to arrest his wife. The murder took place while the couple’s 10-month-old child was in the room.“Arun worked as a technician at a Goregaon-based moulding unit. Due to the lockdown, he was at home since March and the couple would fight daily as Maurya suspected him of having extramarital affairs with various women at his workplace,” said Pradip Kasbe, senior inspector of Boisar MIDC police station, adding that the wife used to regularly beat her husband.On May 18, a fight ensued during which Kavita used a steel pipe and ladle to assault Arun and also kicked him in the stomach. Due to the assault, Arun vomited blood and became unconscious.Maurya then called her brother who rushed Arun to the Tarapur primary health centre (PHC) where he was declared dead. “The PHC informed us and we started to probe the case. On checking Arun’s phone we found video clips of Kavita assaulting him,” said Kasbe. According to the officer, Arun was familiar with his wife’s domestic violence and on Monday, as soon as an argument ensued, he placed his phone on the window sill to film the incident. The footage captured showed Maurya assaulting him.During her interrogation, Maurya confessed to the crime and was arrested under section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). She has been remanded in police custody till May 21, while her brother is absconding.“We sent the body for a post mortem and its report is awaited. We have seized the murder weapons and the 10-month-child is now in the custody of Maurya’s relatives,” said Kasbe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/boisar-woman-murders-husband-attack-filmed-on-victim-s-mobile-phone/story-dw2GgyVtcyNl2be5dqt1oK.html

20-05-2020||City||Congress, BJP MLAs in HP demand special Vidhan Sabha session to discuss Covid-19||Cutting across the party lines, legislators in Himachal Pradesh have demanded a special two-day session of the Vidhan Sabha to discuss COVID-19 pandemic.A joint delegation of legislators from the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and opposition Congress on Wednesday requested Vidhan Sabha Speaker Vipin Singh Parmar to convene a special session of the assembly to discuss the prevailing situation.The delegation, led by leader of opposition Mukesh Agnihotri met Parmar at his office in the Vidhan Sabha complex here. Agnihotri said they have submitted a written request with the Speaker seeking to convene a special session and requested him to send the same to the state government. “Rising above the party lines, all legislators are together in this fight against Covid-19 which has impacted not only India but the entire world,” he added.Agnihotri said a lockdown was imposed in India and Himachal almost two months ago. “The Vidhan Sabha session was also cut short due to the pandemic,” he said. Senior BJP legislator Rakesh Pathania said the session will let people of the state know about the steps being taken to handle the situation and what needs to be done in the future to fight coronavirus.Speaker Vipin Singh Parmar said he has received a request from the joint delegation and it will be considered.Jai Ram flays opposition for politicising the pandemicChief minister Jai Ram Thakur flayed the opposition congress for playing politics over the pandemic. “It is unfortunate that the opposition is politicising the matter. The government is making all efforts to fight coronavirus. This is not the time to play politics. We all should instead unite to fight the disease,” the CM said. “Does the opposition have any treatment for Covid-19? Himachal Pradesh is performing far better than many other states in India,” he said, while sidetracking the allegations that people in quarantine were not being given proper facilities.“The opposition leaders in Himachal Pradesh should first analyse handling of the Covid crisis in the Congress-ruled states, including Rajasthan and Punjab,” the CM said.He said, “There has been a spurt in Covid-19 cases in Himachal Pradesh after the government allowed stranded residents to come back home. Those stranded outside the state were facing immense difficulty and were permitted to come back to their home state on humanitarian grounds. Many of them were stuck in places where Covid-19 infection was spreading.” “All the returnees have been quarantined and those who have tested positive were sent to institutional quarantine centres,” the CM added.“We cannot allow people to die. Those willing to come back home should do it now. Later, we will again restrict the entry of outsides,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/congress-bjp-mlas-in-hp-demand-special-vidhan-sabha-session-to-discuss-covid-19/story-ACRchZCJPw7uCkmB5Qm83O.html

The state education department has directed private schools not to collect fee during the lockdown. The education department had issued an order in this regard in March. Schools are allowed to charge tuition fee, without annual hike, provided they are providing online classes during the lockdown.Despite the government’s instructions, British Co-Ed High School has asked 50 parents to deposit the fee, which comprises Rs 58,000 tuition fee, Rs 11,800 annual fee, Rs 16,500 admission fee, Rs 600 for the calendar and Christmas fee, Rs 1,000 library fee and Rs 1,000 for the annual trip.12 PARENTS COULDN’T SUBMIT THE FEEA distressed mother, on condition of anonymity, said, “How will I will arrange Rs 90,000 out of the blue? Thursday is the last date of fee submission.”“There are 50 students in Class 11. As many as 12 parents failed to arrange the school fee. The school started providing online classes to the students who did pay the fee and barred the others,” she said.Another parent said, “The school administration has asked a few parents to submit the fee in two instalments but we have asked the administration to charge the fee on a quarterly basis.”NOT FORCING PARENTS TO PAY: PRINCIPALExecutive principal Kiren Harika said, “We are not forcing anyone to pay the fee. We have given them the option to pay in instalments. If someone is still having trouble paying the fee, we can discuss the matter.”On excluding students from online classes, she said, “The online classes are just in the initial stage. The syllabus will be repeated for those who haven’t paid yet.”District education officer, secondary, Harinder Kaur, said, “Private schools can only charge tuition fee and only those schools that are providing online classes can charge the fee. We will take strict action against the schools that demand fee. I will look into the school in question.”She said, “I will write to a senior officer and take action against the school if it has defaulted on the orders. The action that will be taken against the school will be decided by a high-ranking official.”Education minister Vijay Inder Singla did not respond to calls and messages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/private-school-in-patiala-demands-annual-admission-christmas-party-library-trip-fee/story-IcqftACOFX4kRBBGvidcMI.html

The bench directed the state through public prosecutor Deepak Thakare and assistant public prosecutor Prajakta Shinde to place “A composite comprehensive report touching upon all the aspects raised in the three PIL petitions as well as indicating measures taken so far” before it on May 26, 2020.

20-05-2020||Lucknow||UP prison inmates make masks, listen to ‘jail radios’ amid coronavirus lockdown||Authorities in Uttar Pradesh began taking all precautionary measures in the states jails even before the nationwide lockdown was enforced from March 25 onwards, including thermal screening and manufacture of sanitisers and face masks etc, a senior officer said.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageIn a telephonic interview with IANS, Uttar Pradesh Director General of Police (Prisons), Anand Kumar, said that an alert had been sounded to state jails on March 12 even as the coronavirus threat was looming large over the country so as to ensure the safety of both inmates and jail staff. Thermal screening was provided in jails as a precautionary measure.The task of manufacture of face masks, sanitisers and soaps was also taken up around that time. “Till May 7, jail inmates have manufactured around 11.49 lakh face masks, out of which 8 lakh have since been provided to government and non-governmental organisations. Also, the inmates and jail staff are using face masks. The manufacture of masks is still continuing,” the DGP (Prisons) said.The senior IPS officer said that the ‘jail radios’ were also coming in handy to fight the stress and anxiety among inmates amid the coronavirus scare in the country.Prisons Department spokesman Santosh Verma said that these radio systems were currently in operation in 26 jails, including those in Ghaziabad, Shahjahanpur, Gorakhpur, Itawah, Agra, Lucknow, and Noida.Verma said that these jail radios had helped prisoners keep themselves busy during the nationwide lockdown. Exchange of news and views through these radios have kept the jail inmates abreast of what is happening in the outside world. Interestingly, these jail radios are operated by prisoners, with jail staff having nothing the do with the endeavour.Official sources said that the 71 jails in Uttar Pradesh house more than 90,000 undertrials and convicted prisoners. As the coronavirus threat loomed large, authorities paroled out 2,251 convicted and 13,453 undertrial prisoners. So, there are still over 75,000 prisoners lodged in state jails.Ten of the 71 jails in Uttar Pradesh are said to be overcrowded -- Moradabad, Jaunpur, Lalitpur, Saharanpur, Ghaziabad, Devaria, Mathura, Varanasi,Shahjahanpur and Itawah. As for the numbers, the Prayagraj jail is the most overcrowded, lodging over 4,000 inmates as compared with its capacity of 2,060 prisoners only.DGP Kumar said that in order to prevent the spread of coronavirus in the jails, 56 temporary jails were set up in 45 districts of Uttar Pradesh. As many as 783 prisoners are lodged there, including 538 Indians and 245 foreigners, so that inmates lodged in regular jails were saved from the spread of coronavirus.Verma said that 100 PPE kits have so far been made in Meerut jail, costing Rs 600 each. He pointed out that a face mask costing Rs 95 was available in the markets outside at five-six times this cost.The work of making PPE kits was also going on in Lucknow Model Jail. At least 132 kits have so far been supplied to Balrampur hospital.DGP Kumar said that they had made efforts to provide sewing machines in jails which so far did not have these, in order to speed up the manufacture of face masks. As for coronavirus cases reported in different jails, the senior officer said that the death of an inmate in Agra jail had come to light. “However, we are trying everything possible to ensure that the jail inmates across Uttar Pradesh are saved from the threat of coronavirus,” he added.(Sanjiv Chauhan can be contacted at sanjiv.c@ians.in)--IANSHindi/tsb||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-prison-inmates-make-masks-listen-to-jail-radios-amid-lockdown/story-Afdt3uRFC1BVgPCb9vwafO.html

20-05-2020||Noida||Buses for migrants moved to Noida by Congress stopped||Engulfed in a bitter ‘bus war’ with Yogi Adityanath-led Uttar Pradesh government, the Congress has managed to move the buses arranged to transport the migrants to Noida. The police, however, stopped the buses in Sector 39 area of Noida and did not allow their movement. Uttar Pradesh Congress Commmitee (UPCC) office bearer and former MLA of Shamli, Pankaj Malik said: “Our leader Priyanka Gandhi has promised to provide 1,000 buses and we are ready at various entry points in the state, but the BJP is doing politics. This is high time to help the migrants.”Meanwhile, Sandeep Singh, the personal aide of Priyanka Gandhi has written another letter on late Tuesday that the buses which are stranded at various entry points will wait for Uttar Pradesh government’s nod till 4 pm on Wednesday.The Uttar Pradesh government had asked buses to be moved to Noida and Ghaziabad.“We are committed to help the migrants and hope the UP government will show positive attitude towards the migrants,” wrote Sandeep Singh to Additional Chief Secretary Avneesh Awasthi.He also blamed Uttar Pradesh police of high-handedness.Amid the ongoing bitter politics over buses for stranded migrant workers, Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Tuesday said that out of 1,049 buses, 879 have been found fit by the Uttar Pradesh government and the party will provide 200 more buses on Wednesday.She also urged the UP government not to delay the bus services for the stranded migrant workers willing to go back to their homes.In a series of tweets, Priyanka Gandhi said: “Uttar Pradesh government has itself said that of the 1,049 buses offered by us, 879 have been found proper in the verification. At Uncha Nagala border our 500 buses have been made to wait by the administration for several hours. Similarly on Delhi border 300 buses are also coming. Please allow 879 buses to ply.”“Tomorrow we will provide the list of 200 more buses for the service. Get the list of those buses also verified. People are in trouble and sad. We cannot delay any further,” Priyanka Gandhi, who is also Congress in-charge of eastern Uttar Pradesh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/buses-for-migrants-moved-to-noida-by-congress-stopped/story-CauD37itCv7Egn0fRr4aVI.html
20-05-2020||Chandigarh||Infected Class-4 employees at Ludhiana civil hospital allege mistreatment||Two days after doctors and paramedics staged a protest over substandard masks, a video circulated by four Class-4 staff members who tested positive for the novel coronavirus disease (Covid-19) alleging mistreatment at the hospital, has caused fresh embarrassment to authorities. In a two-minute video shot on Wednesday morning, the Class-4 contractual employees said they were being treated like untouchables.The staff members who had tested positive on May 18 and 19 said, “Despite being paid a meagre salary (Rs 4,500 a month), we continued to serve Covid-19 patients. However, little did we know that once we become infected we will be treated like second-class citizens by the regular staff members of the hospital.”The patients bolted the door of their room to register their protest.SUBSTANDARD FOODThey alleged that the food being served was substandard.“We had to arrange milk from outside after tea was not offered to us for the entire day. But the staff refused to deliver it to us. If we are treated in such a way then one can imagine the plight of regular patients. We were not even given bed sheets,” said the protesting staff employees.The video shows the four women weeping while narrating their ordeal.“Neither the senior medical officer (SMO) of the hospital nor any other staff member has visited us since our diagnosis,” said the Covid-19 positive employees.Civil surgeon Dr Rajesh Bagga said, “We are a family here and irrespective of being senior or junior, everyone has the right to be treated equally. The four employees contracted the virus while serving patients and it is regrettable that they had to protest to raise the issue of unfair treatment.”“I have directed SMO Dr Geeta Kataria to look into the matter and provide employees with all the necessary items,” said Dr Bagga.NOT A ONE-OFF INCIDENT This is not the first time that lack of facilities have triggered a protest at the civil hospital.Earlier, patients in the isolation wards had protested against the hospital authorities for not providing them with bedsheets while pilgrims who had returned from Nanded had protested against the poor quality food being offered to them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/infected-class-4-employees-at-ludhiana-civil-hospital-allege-mistreatment/story-8uubPfm8WMpnybKFL9ev3I.html

20-05-2020||Mumbai||Dysfunctional Badlapur wastewater treatment plant fined ₹5 lakh for polluting Waldhuni river||The state pollution control board has fined a privately-run Badlapur common effluent treatment plant (CETP) for releasing untreated industrial waste into the Waldhuni river, which had turned red last week due to the pollution.There has been a marginal improvement in water quality this week as the river water was not tainted red as Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) and the CETP managers said effluent treatment was being carried out on priority.The red colour was spotted across several sections of a nine-kilometre stretch of Waldhuni, a tributary of the Ulhas river, which supplies water to cities in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region.Following directions from the National Green Tribunal from January this year, urban local bodies and CETPs failing to treat sewage or effluents are liable to a penalty of Rs 05 lakh.“Every CETP has to pay up a bank guarantee for such violations. We have directed the Badalpur CETP to forfeit their existing bank guarantee, which will be confiscated by us, and the CETP will have to pay double [Rs 10 lakh] as the new bank guarantee and ensure such violations are not repeated,” said Amar Supate, principal scientific officer, MPCB.The CETP is run by an association of local industrial units. According to CETP operators, 22 pharmaceutical, textile, food processing and chemical industries are functional during the lockdown, sending effluents to the dysfunctional CETP.“In their response to our notice, the CETP informed that their operator was not present when some of these 22 industries had begun production. However, they have called in their vigilance team and assured us that such violations of Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, will not be repeated,” said SL Waghmare, regional officer (Kalyan), MPCB.A Badlapur CETP member, requesting anonymity, said they had taken three major decisions following the issue. “A standard operating procedure has been set for all 22 industries functioning during the lockdown that they cannot function until a CETP employee checks their effluent discharge mechanism. Secondly, any new unit starting production needs to take permission from the CETP. Lastly, a separate vigilance team is monitoring daily production and wastewater treatment,” the member said, adding that it was not a textile unit but a drug manufacturing unit part of the essential services using chemicals that led to the red coloured effluents. “The vigilance department is looking into the exact source of pollution, and we submit further compliance reports to MPCB and bear the penalty.”The complainant Ulhasnagar Citizens Forum Satyajit Burman and petitioners before the Supreme Court environment group Vanashakti welcomed the penal action. “We hope the fines serve as a deterrent. We are closely monitoring the situation, and if pollution levels do not decline, we will be forced to seek legal remedy,” said Stalin D, director, Vanashakti.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/dysfunctional-badlapur-wastewater-treatment-plant-fined-5-lakh-for-polluting-waldhuni-river/story-P3VGecw4c7WF8kRkcSrkeO.html
20-05-2020||City||CII suggests measures to improve Himachal’s fiscal prudence||The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) Himachal chapter has submitted suggestions to the state government on improving its fiscal prudence, which has been hit by the Covid-19 pandemic.CII Himachal chairman Col Shailesh Pathak, who met chief minister Jai Ram Thakur on Wednesday, said the delegation apprised the CM about various issues that were hampering industrial activities in the state.“There are certain challenges that have been adversely hampering the sustenance of industry in these difficult times,” said Pathak.He said since industries in Himachal Pradesh were located on the borders, the restrictions on interstate movement of man and material had hit the operations despite having the permission to run the units.“We have suggested a workable solution to the problem and requested the CM to consider the same,” said Pathak.We have also submitted a detailed note on ‘Improving Fiscal Prudence of Himachal Pradesh’ encompassing the key recommendations based on the thrust sectors of the state, he said.“CII believes that the recommendations – for key sectors like horticulture, tourism, renewable energy and pharmaceuticals – if considered and implemented will go a long way in improving the fiscal health of the state in short as well as long term,” he added.CII has exhorted the state government to impress upon the central government for special devolution of financial resources to Himachal.The state government should allow donation to CM relief funds considering the same as corporate social responsibility, on the lines of PM Cares.“The state should also demand the Centre to relax Financial Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act to allow higher borrowings,” said Pathak adding that the pending GST dues for financial year 2019-20 shall also be released to the states.The CII chairman said Himachal must reduce wasteful administrative expenditure and also disinvest in the public sector units and corporations.“CII has laid special emphasis on horticulture and allied services as apple is the most important fruit crop of Himachal Pradesh, which constitutes about 49% of the total area under fruit crops and about 74% of the total fruit production,” he said.Pathak said their other recommendations include ensuring proper and effective supply chains for fruit sale, expediting proposed bulk drug manufacturing park, and developing a strategy to attract investments flowing out of China due to changed global business dynamics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cii-suggests-measures-to-improve-himachal-s-fiscal-prudence/story-SvDeqXaSu2Q9Tm1RY8AMvI.html
20-05-2020||Mumbai||PIL claims private hospitals not admitting, overcharging Covid patients; HC directs to implead BMC chief||The Bombay high court (HC) has directed a petitioner to implead (to make a party in the lawsuit) the municipal commissioner in response to a public interest litigation (PIL) claiming that private hospitals were not admitting Covid-19 patients or overcharging them for treatment. The PIL also stated that the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) was not accepting reports from private testing labs and subjecting tested persons to fresh tests. The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice SS Shinde was of the opinion that the presence of Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) chief Iqbal Chahal was necessary to adjudicate such matters.The PIL filed by Sarika Singh, a resident of Kurla, was brought to hearing through video conferencing by advocate Varsha Jagdale.Jagdale submitted that private hospitals were charging exorbitant amounts for treatment of patients or refusing to treat them at all. She added that Singh was prompted to file the PIL after she learnt that a police constable who had Covid like symptoms, was asked to deposit ₹2 lakh by a private hospital in Vashi to be admitted there.Jagdale added that as the constable was unable to arrange for the amount, he was kept waiting for around five hours. It was only after the local police station threatened to file an FIR against the hospital authorities, that the hospital admitted him with a deposit of ₹20,000. According to the petition, as police personnel are covered by the Aarogya Kutumb Yojana – an insurance cover provided by the centre – private hospitals should not refuse admission to them.It was also submitted on behalf of the petitioner, that test reports issued by private hospitals certifying patients as not infected by Covid-19, were not being accepted by the corporation and they were made to undergo fresh tests. On the suggestion of the government pleader that the BMC commissioner should also be a party to the PIL, the bench allowed the interim application of the petitioner to add him as a respondent.The court observed, “Having regard to the nature of issues raised in the PIL petition and also upon hearing learned counsel appearing for the respective parties, we are of the considered opinion that the presence of the municipal commissioner would be beneficial for proper adjudication of such issues and dispensation of justice on this PIL petition.”With regards to the main prayers in the PIL, the court directed Purnima Kantharia, government pleader for the state, and advocate Yamuna Parekh for the BMC, to obtain instructions from the authorities on grievances raised by the petitioner. The PIL has been posted for further hearing on May 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/pil-claims-private-hospitals-not-admitting-overcharging-covid-patients-hc-directs-to-implead-bmc-chief/story-HbDRzh7SGVTObvT2Epjy1L.html
20-05-2020||Mumbai||AICTE allows management institutes to convert existing MBA intakes to PGDM or vice-versa||The All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) has put an end to the controversy over management courses by agreeing to allow management institutes to convert the entire existing intake of MBA and MMS courses into PGDM intake or vice-versa.According to the consent terms agreed between AICTE and the Association of Indian Management Schools which was submitted to the Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday, the institutes will also have the liberty “to conduct both MBA/MMS and standalone PGDM institute as separate entities from the same premises.”The consent terms have come after the HC on Wednesday sought an explanation from AICTE after the University of Mumbai (MU) said AICTE’s new Admission Process Handbook (APH) which made it mandatory to conduct postgraduate diploma in management (PGDM) as a standalone course was not feasible at least this year.AICTE on February 14, 2020 issued new APH prohibiting institutions from conducting MBA and PGDM courses from the same institution and asked institutions to either convert PGDM course into MBA or convert MBA course into PGDM or start a new institution for conducting PGDM course.Association of Indian Management Schools moved the HC challenging the validity of the new rules. In a petition filed through advocate Ashutosh Kullarni, it has contended that the changes introduced by AICTE for management education institutions through the APH for 2020-21 were “drastic and disastrous” as most management institutes would not be able to meet the requirement.It was also argued on behalf of the association that the options given by AICTE were not feasible as at least half acre land is required to set up a new institute in Mumbai under AICTE norms. “The management will require at least ₹500 crore only for fulfilling this condition,” the association’s lawyer had argued earlier. “These utopian ideas are not capable of implementation,” the lawyer had said.There are 367 institutes that offer PGDBM course in Maharashtra.MU had filed an affidavit in reply to the petition stating the new rules are not feasible, at least for the next academic year. MU also informed the court that consequences would ensue not only upon institutions which run both the courses from same premises but also on the students’ community and the administrative machinery.Justice KR Shriram on Tuesday disposed of the association’s petition in view of the consent terms, which allow management institutes to carry forward and convert all existing intake of part time postgraduate programs of MU into PGDM intake in the next two years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/aicte-allows-management-institutes-to-convert-existing-mba-intakes-to-pgdm-or-vice-versa/story-hqSSEXAjlSe6yz2shEZyEL.html

20-05-2020||Mumbai||HC disposes plea after state assures disposal of seized PPE to frontline workers||The Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday disposed of a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Mohan Joshi, general secretary of the Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee (MPCC), after the state told the bench that a competent authority under the Essential Commodities Act, 1955, has already ordered the release of some of the crucial and vital medical protective equipment and resources seized by the state’s investigating agencies to the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai. The PIL had sought proper disposal of properties under seizure so that it could reach those in the frontline in the battle against Covid-19. The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice SS Shinde, while hearing the PIL through video conferencing, was informed by advocate Vishal Kanade, appearing for Joshi, that since the centre had announced the Covid-19 pandemic, there had been many instances of black marketing and stockpiling of sanitizers, face masks, gloves and other protective equipment. The police had raided and seized these stockpiles.Kanade submitted that in light of a shortage of the protective medical equipment, the petition sought directions to the state to furnish a list of the seized material, action taken after the seizure and to direct the authorities to hand over the material to concerned authorities to distribute it among the frontline workers. The state, through government pleader Poornima Kantharia, submitted an affidavit wherein it was mentioned that the competent authority, under the Essential Commodities Act, had passed interim orders detailing the procedure for disposal of such seized properties but making it clear that such arrangement would be subject to the orders of the criminal court.Kanade informed the court that though the interim orders of the competent authority were challenged in judicial proceedings the same were not stayed and hence the HC should direct the state to implement the interim orders.Kantharia then submitted that action was being taken in terms of the orders of the competent authority and a part of the seized properties had been handed over to the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai.After hearing the submissions the court observed, “So long the orders of the competent authority are not disturbed in judicial proceedings, the state shall make all possible endeavour to implement such orders and ensure that in these trying times the seized properties do reach the end-users for combating Covid-19.” It then disposed of the petition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-disposes-plea-after-state-assures-disposal-of-seized-ppe-to-frontline-workers/story-Bu6JiWzMcCtlLUaVjdV9XO.html

He has also been tending to stray dogs and cats on the streets.“Detained for ferrying migrant workers to their destination in Mumbai. God bless this country,” Shah wrote in a tweet on Tuesday night, in which he tagged the Mumbai Police and police commissioner. “Harassed for 2 hours by Tilak Nagar police..Taken to the police station..Let off by saying please leave.. Suspending all my activities to help the poorest of the poor.. Sorry migrants - the system doesn’t allow me to work for you. Broken heart.. Broken soul..I cry and I am in pain,” he wrote in another tweet.Shah said that he was helping migrants who were walking from Byculla to Ghatkopar, a distance of around 16 km, to catch a bus, when he was detained by police.“I was on the highway between Thane and Nashik, ferrying and providing food for those on the roads for the second half of the day. When I returned to the city at night to help those looking for dinner, I saw a group of around eight to 10 people at Mulund check naka who wanted to reach Byculla. These people had come from Bhiwandi where they did not have any food, were hoping to find work in Mumbai. I dropped them and while taking a U-turn, I saw another group of people, around 30 to 40 of them, who were walking towards LBS Road in Ghatkopar, from where they were to board a bus for Uttar Pradesh. I took around seven to eight of them in the pick-up truck and told others that I would come back to ferry them. At LBS Road the police stopped me,” said Shah.He recalled that the police were abusive and heckled him. “The two constables were getting aggressive and told me to come to the police station. I told them to register a first information report (FIR) as my crime is to help the poor. My volunteer Faizan and I were taken to the police station. They did not register an FIR but detained me. After two hours, they asked me to go with them to LBS Road to drop the migrants, and then I was asked to leave,” he added. Shah said that he has been on the roads for 16 hours a day while observing his fast during the holy month of Ramzan.Shah has been helping the sick and poor on the roads during the lockdown, distributing food, water, juice, and biscuits. “There is a huge humanitarian crisis. If a government is not doing it, we citizens will step out. My mother says that I am putting myself in grave risk. But I cannot sit in my fancy flat and [drive around in my] car. I have to help my fellow citizens,” said Shah, adding that he has now been forced to suspend his efforts.Sushil Kamble, senior inspector, Tilak Nagar police station, said Shah was stopped during routine nakabandi. “There were seven to eight persons in the vehicle which is not allowed. There was no permission for the same,” Kamble said. “The officer who stopped Shah told him that the labourers may face further problems on the road after he drops them. We asked him to take necessary permissions and send them through trains after filling requisite forms,” he added.Sashikumar Meena, deputy commissioner of police, zone 6, said that he would look into the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/activist-afroz-shah-detained-by-cops-for-ferrying-migrants-to-ghatkopar-bus-stand/story-nrbl1ItTrb2F9LglfHnBSP.html

20-05-2020||Lucknow||Mayawati accuses Cong, BJP of doing politics over issue of sending migrants home||BSP chief Mayawati on Wednesday lashed out at the Congress and BJP, accusing them of doing politics over the issue of sending migrant labourers home. The Congress and Uttar Pradesh government have been involved in a war of words over the issue of buses for migrants. In a series of tweets, Mayawati said, “The disgusting politics being done in the past several days, specially by the BJP and Congress in the name of sending migrant labourers home is most unfortunate. Are these parties accusing each other in connivance to divert attention from the tragedy?”.“If it is not so then the BSP has to say that instead of insisting on sending the migrants by buses, the Congress should help them go home by trains by arranging their tickets,” she said in another tweet. The former UP chief minister said BSP workers have been helping migrants in the entire country “without caring for publicity”.“Unlike the BJP and Congress, BSP has not indulged in any disgusting politics,” she said.“Also, BSP has a suggestion for the Congress party that if they have to help the migrants return through buses only and not by train, then it would be better that they send these buses to Congress-ruled states for helping labourers “ Mayawati said. The UP government on Tuesday said the list of 1,000 buses offered by the Congress to ferry migrant workers contained registration numbers of two-wheelers and cars. The Congress, however, rejected the claim, challenging Yogi Adityanath’s government to conduct a “physical verification” of the buses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/mayawati-accuses-cong-bjp-of-doing-politics-over-issue-of-sending-migrants-home/story-hoFoUsyWUnIIsTFsKr8BsM.html

20-05-2020||Lucknow||UP govt’s austerity measures: Curbs on official travel, no new vehicles||The Uttar Pradesh government has decided on a number of austerity and financial management measures for government departments and officers in view of Covid-19.The government has asked its departments not to buy any new vehicles and cut official travel by holding video-conference instead. If at all, travel is necessary, the officials have been asked to fly only economy class. The government has banned business and executive class travel for its officers in the current fiscal.Additional chief secretary, finance, Sanjeev Mittal issued an order to this effect on Monday. He marked the order, ‘Austerity measures and financial management in the circumstances that have emerged because of Covid-19 pandemic’, to all the additional chief secretaries, principal secretaries, secretaries and heads of departments in the state.“Under any circumstances, do not use hotels in the current fiscal for conferences, seminars, meetings. Use only government buildings and premises for such events,” said Mittal’s order.Departments have been asked not to buy any new vehicles. In such cases where old vehicles are rendered out of service, they are to be replaced by outsourced ones. Mittal also asked officials to curtail the cost incurred on fuel and maintenance. The government will now not allow any new appointment of support staff advisors, chairpersons and members in various departments.“Either use the surplus staff as support staff or outsource them if essential,” said Mittal.“Now under the new work culture and information technology, several jobs are obsolete. Abolish those posts, identify those working on such posts and deploy them elsewhere. The departments should not have any new appointments,” he said.The government has also instructed the departments not to initiate any new construction work that is not necessary now. However, construction that was initiated earlier may be completed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-govt-s-austerity-measures-curbs-on-official-travel-no-new-vehicles/story-ma9v98jqyWUi46q8ZGUMgP.html

Ensure payment of salaries during lockdown/curfew to all workers and 70% of it should be paid by government. Property tax, garbage collection fees and other taxes in urban areas should be waived off for at least six months, school fee should also be waived,” said CPI(M) leaders.CPI(M) leader Sanjay Chauhan said almost two months have gone since the lockdown was imposed and all businesses and workers are reeling under a severe economic and financial crisis. ”If the state government does not provide a timely relief package, it will be a challenge to keep businesses economically viable,” Chauhan said.“This economic package and a concrete strategy to get out of lockdown/curfew is necessary to rejuvenate the sinking economy,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/cpi-m-demands-himachal-govt-provide-relief-package-to-all-sectors/story-Chkcofy65zSTqnaST1xiNJ.html
20-05-2020||Lucknow||UP Dy CM Dinesh Sharma accuses Congress of playing politics in times of crisis||Uttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Dinesh Sharma on Wednesday accused the Congress of playing politics at a time of intense crisis, saying this has never been done before by a major political party.“There are no buses of the Congress party. These buses belong to the Rajasthan government. When the list of buses submitted by the Congress was analysed, it was found that around 460 vehicles are fake. Doing politics in times of such an intense crisis was never ever done by a major political party before,” he told reporters here.The deputy CM claimed nearly 300 vehicles mentioned in the list were unfit to ply on roads.“First they gave a list, then in the list there were buses of a state government, and of those, around 460 were found to be fake. Around 297 buses are virtually junk and unfit to ply on roads,” he said.“Should we ply the unfit buses and put the lives of the migrant labourers at risk? There are 98 three-wheelers, cars and ambulances in the list. Around 68 vehicles in the list do not have proper papers,” Sharma added.He also asked how the resources of a state government could be utilised by a political party.“Can any political party use the buses of the Rajasthan State Roadways Transport Corporation as its own? How can the resources of a state government be utilised by a political party? On what basis are these buses being run,” the dy CM asked.“Here, I want to ask them why Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot did not feel sad when our children were crying in Kota (the coaching hub) as they were not getting food, water and treatment? Where had his buses gone then,” Sharma said.At that time, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath issued orders to run over 600 buses to bring back the students to UP and send them to their homes, and Gehlot was compelled to praise the UP CM, Sharma said.He said the action of the Congress was a political stunt aimed at deriving some mileage.“If it (Congress) wants to help the migrant labourers of UP in other states, then they should send buses to Rajasthan, Punjab and Maharashtra, as people are being exploited. Why did it not send buses to Punjab and Maharashtra,” he asked.The deputy chief minister said around 1,000 trains were made available to UP at the request of the chief minister, and more than 10 lakh migrant labourers have been brought back to the state by trains. Around 6.50 lakh migrants came in buses, he said, adding that over 27,000 buses had been pressed into action by the state government.“The Congress has duped the migrant labourers and kept the UP government in the dark. It should tender an apology for providing a wrong list of buses and wasting the time of the government. They also conspired to put the lives of the migrant labourers at risk and hence, tender an apology to the labourers. Are these Transport Department buses the private property of the Congress party? The resources of a state government cannot be used for a political party,” Sharma said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-dy-cm-dinesh-sharma-accuses-congress-of-playing-politics-in-times-of-crisis/story-ZQJNxPE6qfaY9yWoDdEV2O.html
20-05-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai: Missing Covid-19 patients cause for concern for BMC||Even as Mumbai’s Covid-19 count witnesses a significant rise with each passing day, missing coronavirus patients are proving to be a major cause for concern for the city’s civic body, which has adopted all possible means to trace them.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThis was a common occurrence in cases where people experience mild symptoms of the infection or are asymptomatic and undergo testing in private labs, an official from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation said.“When people who get tested don’t furnish their correct contact details like address or phone number, we have to go looking for them after they test positive for the infection. Even testing labs make mistakes while entering contact details of the patients,” the official said.For the civic body, which is already burdened with the arduous task of containing the pandemic, untraceable patients are a major concern, as they can worsen the situation.Mumbai reported its first case of coronavirus on March 11 and as of Tuesday, the city has recorded over 22,700 cases.According to a senior civic official, the BMC adopts all possible means to track down these missing patients from searching for their names on voter’s list or tracing them using property card records.Once they are found, these patients were admitted to the BMC’s Covid-19 facilities, depending on their health condition, asymptomatic or otherwise, he said.“We have to rifle through property card records or voters lists and even take the help of local representatives to trace missing patients,” the official said.In some cases, the civic body even had to check the CCTV footage from private testing labs where these missing patients had been tested, he added.Most of these untraceable patients were from slum- dominated areas, where people have some fears and misconceptions about testing positive, which prompt them to furnish fake details to avoid hospitalisation, the official added.

Therefore, initially, 1.5 lakh women from each household have agreed to get associated with this scheme, which will not only ensure nutritional security for the family but also generate additional income,” he said.EACH WOMAN TO GET RS 1 LAKH CASH INCENTIVE As per estimates, each woman is expected to get an annual cash incentive of Rs 1 lakh under MGNREGS, which includes a per day wage of Rs 198.“After every 15 days, the women’s wages will be transferred to their Aadhar-linked bank account,” Jain said.The government’s task force, the Gram Rozgar Sewaks, which will monitor the beneficiaries.Each beneficiary is entitled to claim reimbursements for purchased seasonal vegetable seeds and fruit tree saplings as advised by the agriculture and horticulture departments.GRANTS FOR VERMICOMPOST, IRRIGATIONFor development of land and setting up irrigation channels, the beneficiaries will get a grant up to Rs 40,000 and for setting a concrete vermicompost pit they will be given Rs 10,000. This money will be provided under MGNREGS.Chief minister Jai Ram Thakur said amid the battle to contain the coronavirus, the government is focusing on the revival of economic activity in rural areas as the state is predominantly governed by agriculture activities.The Mukhya Mantri 1 Bigha Scheme will not only help enhance their skills but also cushion the impact of the pandemic, he said.“This will turn out to be a win-win situation for rural women empowerment. On one hand it will help enhancing incomes and skills, on the other they will manage to develop their assets permanently,” said Thakur.As per the Economic Survey 2019-20, 181.74 lakh days were generated under the MGNREGS by providing employment to 447,773 households in the state.The state has a network of 2,191 bank branches and more than 77%branches are in rural areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/himachal-to-empower-rural-women-through-mukhya-mantri-1-bigha-scheme/story-aV4sIvAHdEb0pHxQcz7J6M.html

20-05-2020||Lucknow||Unauthorised trucks come to rescue of migrants again||Days after the state government ordered to seal the Lucknow borders to prevent migrant labourers from travelling to their home on foot or unauthorised vehicles, a large number of labourers were seen within city limits stuffed in trucks and other vehicles and moving towards east UP districts and Bihar.People said migrants hopped on trucks and other vehicles as the administration failed to arrange adequate number of buses and trains on time.The district administration, meanwhile, claimed it dispatched nearly 17,000 migrant labourers in two days on 450 buses.“On Sunday and Monday, some migrant labourers who wanted to go to Bihar were dispatched in buses till Gorakhpur. Those bound to Jammu and Laddakh were dispatched in buses till Jammu,” said additional district magistrate (ADM), city east, KP Singh.Migrant labourers who want to go to Chhattisgarh are waiting for the arrangement.“We are waiting for vehicles. The administration says trains will start soon,” said Sandeep Kumar of Bilaspur in Chhattisgarh.After police sealed all entry points of Lucknow on Saturday night, the movement of migrant labourers was halted.Migrants from all entry points were taken to Shakuntala Mishra university campus.By Monday, the strictness was eased and migrants were seen hopping onto trucks at different points of UP.This, even when chief minister Yogi Adityanath had directed officials to arrange for private buses.In Lucknow, around 25 private buses were dispatched on Monday while more than 100 on Sunday, said an official.Neeraj Kumar of Bihar’s Motihari district said, “We started from Bengaluru around 6 days ago.

We exhausted the entire savings to reach here,” said Lallan Yadav, a Motihari youth who worked as a labourer in Bengaluru.Two trucks ferrying over 100 Motihari-bound migrant labourers stopped near Kamta bypass after seeing people distributing water bottles and food packets.“We were told that buses will be arranged but nothing happened.

20-05-2020||Jaipur||Lockdown, financial crunch prolongs Afghan students’ return home from Kota||Over the past few weeks, even as hundreds of students studying in coaching institutes in Rajasthan’s Kota have returned to their states during the nationwide lockdown, the wait is getting longer for over a dozen students from Afghanistan of a private university in the city.These students are still stranded in India due to the lockdown imposed in the wake of Covid-19 outbreak and financial crunch. Many have been unable to board the special flights being organised by the Afghanistan government for its citizens. The Afghan embassy in India is providing information about these paid flights and the next ones out of New Delhi are scheduled for May 21 and 23.Twenty three-year-old Kabul resident Saedullah is BA first year student of English Literature at Kota’s Career Point University. He is among the Afghan students trying to return home. “We approached the district administration of Kota for facilitating our return to Afghanistan and. But we cannot travel to Delhi (to board flight for Afghanistan) on train since we do not have Aadhaar cards. So, the administration told us to go to Delhi through car or taxi”, he said.But owing to the high cab fares which most Afghan students cannot afford and fund crunch as banks in Afghanistan are closed due to lockdown, they are forced to stay in India, he said.“If we had got permission to go to Delhi on train, then we could have booked special flights on May 21 and 23. But now we have learnt that there aren’t any seats left, so we have dropped the idea to return to our home country for the time being”, he said.“The Afghanistation ambassador has shared a message on the official portal that efforts are being made for additional flights in the first week of June, so we will try to board those special flights then”, he added. 📢Important announcement: We are facilitating 1 special flight from #Pune to #Kabul on 22nd of May & 2 flights from Delhi to Kabul on May 21st & 23rd to help those students wishing to get back home. Another flight taking off Delhi to Kabul today. Contact airlines for arrangements pic.twitter.com/zqPhtlPx14Another Afghan student, 20-year-old Shahgul Yakub, pursuing a BA degree, is also disappointed at not being able to go back home.“I am disappointed that we are not able to return to our homes due to lack of seats in special flights to Afghanistan. We want to go to our homes but unfortunately the situation is such that we are not able to return to our homes”, she said.Yakub said that there are around two dozen Afghan students in Kota and many among them do not want to return home right now as they will have to again come back to Kota to continue their studies.When asked about the issue of Afghan students, Kota District Collector Om Kasera said that as per rules, only Indian citizens are allowed to travel in trains.“We have allowed Afghan students to leave for Delhi through car or taxi but they cannot be sent through trains due to norms as only Indian citizens are allowed to travel in the trains”.However, Kasera said “If they do not want to travel in car or taxi, we can send them to Delhi through buses”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/lockdown-financial-crunch-prolongs-afghan-students-return-home-from-kota/story-fDHkJmRCf8PF1ZPU2pPJ8J.html

20-05-2020||Lucknow||‘Efforts on to hire jobless migrant workers for DFC project’||At a time when lockdown has rendered umpteen migrant workers jobless, officials of dedicated freight corridor (DFC) project are making efforts to provide them work. Owing to massive demand of workers, DFC authorities have written to district magistrates of several districts across nine states, including UP, to hold back the migrant labourers and send them to DFC so that the migrant labours could be trained and provided work.“These workers can look forward to receiving a fast-paced training and get hired for laying railway tracks in different sections of DFC as per need. Efforts in this regard have been initiated by officials of both eastern and western DFCs of the country at their respective locations, including between Dankuni in West Bengal and Ludhiana in Punjab, falling under eastern DFC,” said eastern DFC’s chief public relations officer (CPRO) Ved Prakash.He further said the ongoing work had stopped in various sections during to the first phase of the lockdown and then was re-started when the government issued fresh norms subsequently.“We require a large number of workers for the DFC work and want to absorb a chunk of migrant factory workers made jobless during the lockdown and now heading to their native homes in hordes,” he added.The union ministry of railways, under the Centre’s direction, has taken up the DFC project involving construction of six freight corridors traversing the entire country to provide a safe and efficient freight transportation system.Initially, the construction of two freight corridors, the western DFC connecting the states of Haryana and Maharashtra and the eastern DFC connecting Punjab and West Bengal, is being undertaken. The combined length of the western and eastern DFCs is approximately 2,843 km to be readied at an estimated cost of $11.38 billion. The aim is to make them fully operational by 2021.The other four proposed corridors include North-South (Delhi-Tamil Nadu), East-West (West Bengal-Maharashtra), East-South (West Bengal-Andhra Pradesh) and South-South (Tamil Nadu-Goa). However, these are still in the planning stage.In 2006, the Government of India established a dedicated body to implement the project, called the Dedicated Freight Corridor Corporation of India (DFCCIL), which began building the eastern and western corridors simultaneously in three phases.The DFC project is expected to reduce congestion at various terminals and junctions. It will also allow efficient and fast movement of freight along the corridor, share officials.The eastern DFC plan covering Punjab, Haryana, UP, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal includes construction of 104 bridges, 368 road-over-bridges (ROBs), 189 road-under-bridges (RUBs) and 21 flyovers. It also includes the reconstruction of nine existing ROBs and the extension of ten existing RUBs.The western DFC plan covering Haryana, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra and UP includes a 4 km-long tunnel, 262 bridges, 33 flyovers, 505 ROBs and 200 RUBs.

20-05-2020||Lucknow||Akhilesh targets govt over ‘use’ of buses in ferrying migrants||Joining the ongoing ‘buses for migrants’ issue in the state, the Samajwadi Party (SP) national president Akhilesh Yadav on Tuesday attacked the BJP government over the availability of buses for ferrying migrants to their homes. “People are finding it difficult to comprehend that when tens of thousands of government, private, and school buses are idling all over the state, why the state government is not using them to transport migrants to their homes. What kind of stubbornness is this? Using ‘Bal’ (force) [on migrants] in place of ‘Bus’ is improper,” he said in a tweet.On Monday within hours of the UP government’s green signal to the 1,000 buses request of Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, an Amethi MLA of Samajwadi Party (SP) had sought permission for 50 buses to transport Amethi’s migrant workers stranded in Delhi, Ghaziabad, Noida, and other districts. Gauriganj (Amethi) MLA Rakesh Pratap Singh wrote to chief minister Yogi Adityanath in this regard. However, Singh has himself not arranged any buses but has said he will pay whatever money is spent on transporting the migrants by 50 buses. He said the state government should help in bringing back Amethi’s migrant workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/akhilesh-targets-govt-over-use-of-buses-in-ferrying-migrants/story-dKnWJVwR441fqKrJqCTKNJ.html

20-05-2020||Mumbai||Is Mumbai tracking New York’s Covid-19 trajectory? A data analysis||With cases of Covid-19 rising at an alarming rate in Mumbai in the past few weeks, questions emerge if it is headed on a trajectory not too different to what New York City followed as it became the pandemic hotbed in the United States.Both are the worst-hit cities in their respective countries.Here is a look at numbers to see if the spread of the Sars-CoV-2 virus in Mumbai can flare like it has in New York.Difference of demography Mumbai is roughly half the size of New York City and has more than 1.5 times the population, according to numbers by the 2011 census in India and 2010 census in the US. This means that on average, India’s financial capital has more than three times as many people living in every square kilometre compared to the Big Apple.Also crucial is the presence of ultra high population areas in Mumbai like Asia’s largest urban slum, Dharavi, which has seen 1,327 cases and 56 deaths due to Covid-19. All of this places Mumbai at a massive disadvantage as the congestion makes it far easier for the virus to spread.Spike vs gradual rise In absolute numbers, New York City has reported more than nine times the cases and 270 the number of deaths than Mumbai. For uniform comparison, the starting point is the first day each city reported over 50 cases. New York saw a very steep rise off the start and only 15 day in, it had a gap of nearly 15,000 cases over Mumbai. However, a drop in new cases towards the middle of March brought the NYC curve down.The trajectory followed by Mumbai is more even with a gradual increase of cases. However, unlike the drop seen in NYC’s curve, Mumbai’s remains rising at a steady rate.‘Flat’ vs ‘rising’ For our analysis, we have plotted a five-day average line over the daily new cases to how a clear trend. We see that while the trend line is rising rapidly in Mumbai in the last 60 days, in NYC, it appears to have weathered the worst of the storm. New cases in NYC are now consistently getting ;ower than the peak seena t the start of April.(Source: HT’s Covid-19 dashboard and Johns Hopkins University)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/is-mumbai-tracking-new-york-s-covid-19-trajectory-a-data-analysis/story-3H5Fg6gbNKcIGMEpSF6uTO.html

Shalini Chawla, distinguished fellow, Centre for Air Power Studies (CAPS) said India is now making efforts for diplomatic isolation of Pakistan, by highlighting its policy towards terrorism, at various international forums. She said these sustained efforts improved India’s position at the international level, which was highlighted when India’s air strikes at Balakot, after the Pulwama terrorist attack, was not condemned by any nation. She said Pakistan has recently created a new terrorist organisation for Kashmir, The Resistance Front (TRF), that has brought members of various terrorist organisations under its banner, since it has not been banned. Chawla added that Pakistan has been relying on local Kashmiri terrorists since infiltration of the Line of Control (LoC) has become difficult and the government is using its “Indian Threat” narrative to justify increase in military spending. “The upcoming US withdrawal from Afghanistan is only going to strengthen Pakistan’s hold on that country through Taliban, which it will later be used against India,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/dynamics-of-indo-pak-relations-in-focus-during-webinar-at-panjab-university/story-o3VUDrsY81wCZCmLocl9bP.html

20-05-2020||Mumbai||ICMR’s new rule will push up number of undiagnosed Covid patients, say doctors||The Indian Council of Medical Research’s (ICMR) new testing guideline, released on Monday, has left doctors confused. Doctors said that the new rule, which states that only symptomatic patients with influenza-like illnesses (ILI) within hotspots and containment zones are qualified for coronavirus tests, is a “diplomatic decision to decrease the number of contaminated zones”.Doctors claimed that the new rule implicates that other suspected people with similar symptoms from outside these areas will not be tested.The Union Health Ministry defines the containment zone as a specific geographical area where positive cases of coronavirus are found. The authorities declare some lanes or neighbourhoods as containment zones even if it has one case, but it is declared a hotspot particularly when more than 6 cases appear.Now, doctors’ associations are raising the question— if no more new patients aren’t diagnosed outside the already marked zones, there will be no enmarkment of new containment zones of hot spots. This will ultimately diminish the rising number of infected zones but let loose undiagnosed Covid-19 patients from other areas, alleged doctors.“The rule is diplomatically correct, fundamentally wrong. This will help to reduce new containment zones as no more new cases will be identified outside those areas. Thus, no new containment zones will be created,” said Dr Deepak Baid, president of the association.“But this will let go of several undetected patients even if they have symptoms.”At present, in Mumbai, there are over 3,000 containment zones. Indian Medical Association (IMA) also criticised the new rule and demanded the involvement of doctors’associations in framing it. “So far, we have been testing symptomatic patients coming to our fever clinics. Now, with the new rules, we will never let them go if they don’t belong from containment zones,” said Dr Avinash Bhondwe, president IMA- Maharashtra. Doctors also fear that it may increase the number of submissions of fake addresses. “This may force people to give wrong addresses from the containment zones to qualify for the test. And we don’t even have the provision to check it. But it will delay the contact tracing of infected patients,” he added.Other than this, people with recent international travel history, symptomatic close contact of infected patients, health workers, patients with severe acute respiratory infections (SARI), high risk contact of confirmed patients, symptomatic migrant workers and hospitalized patients can undergo tests with the recommendation of doctors.The Indian Council of Medical Research’s (ICMR) new testing guideline, released on Monday, has left doctors confused.

20-05-2020||Lucknow||Lucknow ready to shift gears in lockdown 4.0||It’s 12.30 pm and the temperature is a scorching 40 degrees Celsius.But unmindful of the heat, Vijay Shanker Verma, 64, more popularly known as ‘Lalla’ in Chaupatiyan locality of the old city, is busy getting his shop cleaned.“Today I have opened it for the first time March 23. But I don’t have any mutton supplies so I didn’t do any business. My workers have returned and we are waiting for the government nod to resume sale of non-vegetarian food, specially because Eid is close,” says Verma, the chef and owner of ‘Lalla Biryani’, a 35- year-old shop.Since he speaks of Eid, does his customer base include Muslims too? Muslims prefer ‘halal’ (which means permissible in Arabic) meat. So does ‘Lalla’ a Hindu, follow ‘halal’ slaughtering of animals, meaning killing an animal through a slow cut to the vein, carotid artery and windpipe? Hindus and Sikhs are known to prefer ‘jhatka’ or swift slaughter. Verma’s answer showcases the communal amity of Lucknow. “I operate my shop out of a mosque and buy my stuff from Muslims only. About 40 per cent of my client base is Muslim. I am an Indian first, a Hindu later,” he says. Old city in Lucknow is home to some iconic eateries – Tundey kebabs, Raheem’s Kulcha Nahari, Mubeen’s pasanda kebabs, Idrees’ biryani, all of whom are just about as eager to open. “We have heard that the government might allow sale of meat from Wednesday and if that happens we will slowly start operations,” said Abu Bakr, the owner of Idrees Biryani. From salt ‘lassi’ to makhan malai and ‘rabri’, the special ‘kesar milk’ and those mouth watering ‘imartis’ or the refreshing ‘thandai’, he old city is a foodie’s paradise.Many labyrinthian lanes of the old city are also famous for ‘khastas and samosas’ deep fried in desi ghee, drawing people from across the city. This part of the state capital is also famous for its intricate zardozi and chikankari art work – all of which has been hit. “I think it will still take a day or two for things to normalise,” says Mohd Shahzad, a zardozi worker who has come back from Hardoi hoping to begin work.“We heard that there would be some relaxations but at least today there has not been any work. Like me hundreds of workers are waiting to start work,” he said.TRAFFIC LIGHTS COME TO LIFEAt the Vidhan Sabha Marg, traffic lights have come to life. The once deserted roads have started recording decent movement. Waiting at the crossing for the light to turn green, one can see that nearly all movement is on personal vehicles.There are a few buses too, but it is not clear if they are ferrying people or running exclusively for migrants whom the government has barred from walking on the road or cycle their way back to their village. “It has been done for their safety as they were dying on the roads and putting themselves at great risk while walking abnormally huge distances,” a policeman manning the Vidhan Sabha Marg crossing says. One quickly realises that there are fewer barricades on the road. The curbs are coming off, bit by bit.MASK PLEASE!At the polytechnic crossing and in Indira Nagar, policemen check if the people follow the mask-social distancing norm while driving. “There can just be two persons other than driver in the car and pillion riding isn’t allowed on two wheelers,” says a policeman as he stops a motorcyclist violating the norm. Going out without a mask or face cover or violating social distancing protocol while driving can lead to a fine of Rs 1000. However, the policemen at polytechnic crossing clear people with a warning.AH, SWEETS!There are just two sweetshops open-- Tripathi’s in Hussainganj and another small shop in the old city. “I made ‘boondi ke laddoo’ as today is Tuesday when many people offer them as ‘prasad’ (offering) to lord Hanuman,” says V Tripathi, the owner of one of the city’s oldest sweet shops.But the more popular Chappan Bhog in Sadar and Ram Asrey in old city as well as in Hazratganj are closed, as is Parampara, another famous sweetshop. BUSINESS IS PEANUTS!At the Moongphali Mandi, a wholesale market of puffed rice, roasted grams and peanuts, shopkeepers say the business is down.“In pre-lockdown days we had buyers from across the state capital and did business of Rs 8000. Now, it has shrunk to just about Rs 2000, that too because it’s the cheapest food the poor can afford and vendors are coming to buy it,” says Roshan Gupta, a whole seller who explains that gram and puffed rice is nutritious too.TESTING WATERS!A lone cloth shop is open at Mahanagar crossing and the owner is busy chatting on the phone. “Please don’t take a photo,” he requests, before getting back to his mobile.CONTAINMENT ZONES!An entire food street in Nazirabad is closed for vehicular traffic. This street also houses a row of food joints, the most popular being Tundey Kebabs, the first shop Tundey’s family set up out of old city. This area is a covid hotspot, a policeman says, explaining why the food street has been barricaded. Another street out of bounds is Latouche Road that opens at Qaiserbagh crossing and has a queer mix of gun shops, music shops and sanitaryware stores.There have been several corona positive cases from the vicinity leading to the barricade.IRONY! While driving out of the old city, one cannot resist capturing an interesting photo. A fruit seller has parked his cart right at the entrance of Mubin’s non-vegetarian shop. The irony of the situation isn’t lost on some young Muslim women. “It seems Mubin has diversified his business and started selling fruits too!” they joke. PARTING SHOT! At Madhurima, a bakery-cum-restaurant in Gomtinagar, one stops for a reality check. At the entrance the watchman subjects one to a thermo scan. “You can’t go in, your temperature is reading 41 on this machine,” he says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/lucknow-ready-to-shift-gears-in-lockdown-4-0/story-N6J5N5no1kc3tD9aUJ1ZqI.html
20-05-2020||City||Day 1 of lockdown 4.0: Bleak response as public transport resumes in and around Chandigarh||Even though fresh relaxations in the tricity have allowed for public transport to resume services, albeit maintaining social distancing, there were hardly any takers on Tuesday.Many auto-rickshaws were found parked at the stands. A few inter-state CTU buses seen on the roads didn’t have any passengers.Charanjit Singh, an auto driver based in Chandigarh, said, “I started the auto after two months today, but till 2pm, I could not find a single customer. It is heartbreaking to see such a response.”Another driver, Raju Prasad, said that he had been surviving on food provided by the administration and loans from local vendors.A Mohali-based Uber driver said, “The response has been poor. People are preferring their own transport over cabs.”MANY DRIVERS HAVE LEFTRam Chander, an auto-rickshaw driver working in Sector 38, said, “In Sector 38, 12 auto drivers used to work, now only one or two are left. Most of them from Bihar and UP have left for their homes because there was no source of livelihood. Their auto-rickshaws are still here.”“I stayed back because I have a loan to repay that I took to buy this auto. I thought that schools would reopen and I would make some money, but that hasn’t happened either.”An Uber driver from Mohali said, “We do not have enough drivers and cars because many left after the lockdown began. Also, the yearly permits of many vehicles expired in March and they can begin services only after renewing the permits.”INTERSTATE CAB OPERATIONS A CHAOSAlthough both Ola and Uber became operational on Tuesday, many tricity residents faced trouble while trying to book interstate rides.Junaid Maqbool, a student of Panjab University, said, “I tried booking an Uber for Mohali from Chandigarh, but it displayed an error message after which I took Ola.”Many passengers said that cabs were operating within the district only. In lockdown 4.0, inter-state travel for cabs has been permitted in Chandigarh and Mohali, but in Panchkula, only intra-district travel is allowed for now.NEW CAB DRIVING NORMSCab services have said the drivers will not travel to containment zones. Drivers will be provided with masks, sanitizers and disinfectants, the common surfaces like door handles and seats will be cleaned after every ride.Ola, in an official statement, said that both drivers, as well as customers, will be given an option of cancelling a ride if the other is not wearing a mask.Moreover, there will be no AC in cars and cashless payments will be encouraged.Intra-district bus service resumed in Panchkula on Tuesday with nine buses to ply to Barwala, Raipur Rani, Naraingarh, Pinjore, Kalka and even to Ambala and Yamunanagar. However, on the first day there was poor response and most of the buses did not start in the absence of adequate passengers, said Ravinder Pathak, general manager, Haryana Roadways.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/day-1-of-lockdown-4-0-bleak-response-as-public-transport-resumes-in-and-around-chandigarh/story-JcXjTJdXn8ml0V33dPStxL.html
20-05-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh gets just 3 stars in Centre’s garbage-free rating||Chandigarh’s waste management system has got three stars in the latest garbage-free star rating released for 141 cities by the central government on Tuesday. An initiative of the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, a seven-star rating is the highest, awarded to the city with a perfect waste management system. The municipal corporation (MC) was aspiring for five-star rating this year and also planning to achieve the highest seven-star rating next year.However, Chandigarh fell short of the target. While mayor Raj Bala Malik said the three-star rating was an achievement, MC leader of opposition Devinder Babla said, “MC must introspect why other cities not as organised as Chandigarh fared well in the ratings. The delay in waste management reforms on the ground continue to ruin city’s perspective in Swachh Survekshan rankings and much of the credit goes to slow decision making by the BJP-ruled MC,” he said MC commissioner KK Yadav said, “While city was lagging behind in waste segregation and processing, three-star can’t be underrated when just six cities got five-star rating and none so far has been rated seven stars. “We will definitely try to get better rating next year as most of our waste reforms will be achieved,” Yadav added. Poor rating last year tooThe star rating, awarded on the basis of 25 key parameters across the solid waste management spectrum, helps cities assess their progress while encouraging them to move towards a better rating, thereby improving their overall cleanliness and aesthetics.However, Chandigarh made little progress ever since rating began in 2019, when it got only two stars.This time, it went one step up the ladder but it is not enough especially when star rating is now linked with the annual Swachh Survekshan.The annual cleanliness survey has reserved 1,000 (20%) marks for better garbage-free star rating. With Chandigarh getting low rating, it will not be able to score more than 50% marks in this category. On the other hand, cities like Ambikapur, Rajkot, Surat, Mysore, Indore and Navi Mumbai were awarded five-star rating. Their final ranking in Swachh Survekshan is likely to surpass Chandigarh, said MC insiders. Vinod Vashisht, convener, City Forum of Residents Welfare Associations, said, “There are strong chances that the city will not be in top 10 in Swachh rankings this year. We continue to struggle with poor waste management infrastructure despite tall claims.” Where the city faltered?Unable to achieve 100% waste collection and segregation of garbage till processingAll public and commercials areas not sweeped twice a dayUnable to place twin bins (blue and green) at every 50-100 metres in all public and commercial areasYet to set up material recovery facility for garbage collection, sorting, storage, recycle, processing and saleUnable to accomplish 100% scientific processing of wasteRules framed but penalties and spot fines for non-segregation and littering not implementedProcessing of construction and debris is slowLacks robust citizen grievance redressal and feedback systemDrains and water bodies are not cleanedExisting dumping site needs to be levelled||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-gets-just-3-stars-in-centre-s-garbage-free-rating/story-7ZXudNK4E0yuuq05OGOIQJ.html

20-05-2020||Mumbai||FIR against Mumbai doctors if patient sent for swab test sans examination||Doctors found prescribing swab tests to detect Covid-19 without examining patients could not only lose their licences to practice, but will also face a criminal case under section 188 (disobedience of an order promulgated by a public servant) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Epidemic Act of 1897, the civic body’s notice, issued on Sunday, stated. On May 7, HT was the first to report that the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) was planning to file a first information report (FIR) against doctors prescribing tests without physical examination. A sample of the police form was also forwarded to ward officers but the proposal was called off. However, new BMC commissioner Iqbal Chahal has reinforced the rule to stop unethical practices. The BMC notice stated that all medical officers of health (MOH) of the 24 wards should follow the standard operating procedure (SOP) for swab testing. The ward officers will have to inform police to file FIR against the doctors if they are found violating the rules. “If an MOH finds that local private medical practice is giving recommendation letters for swab testing to outside area persons without physical examination, then strict action may be taken against such doctors as show cause notice for cancellation for registration and to lodge an FIR in local police station,” reads the notice. However, it has garnered much criticism from the medical fraternity, with the doctors terming the rule as “tyrannical” and “draconian”. “This is unacceptable...we are putting our lives at risk to save people. A corporation can’t just decide to file an FIR against us. Also, cancellation of a licence is up to the medical council. BMC has no role or authority in it,” said Dr Avinash Bhondwe, president of Indian Medical Association (IMA), Maharashtra. The Association of Medical Consultants, Mumbai, has written to the BMC commissioner seeking an exemption against the rule and said it contradicts the telemedicine policy of the central health department. On March 21, when the Union health ministry issued the guidelines for Covid-19 testing in private laboratories, it had stated, “Laboratory test should only be offered when prescribed by a qualified physician as per the ICMR [Indian Council of Medical Research] guidelines.”Dr Deepak Baid, president of the association, said, “Under telemedicine, a registered medical practitioner can evaluate and prescribe laboratory or radiology tests to suspected callers. In such a case, the doctors send the prescription through WhatsApp and emails. This is more effective and safer,” said Dr Baid.Earlier this month, BMC was planning to bring such a rule when a doctor from Delhi prescribed Covid test to a Mumbai resident without a physician examination. The incident came to light after the private laboratory where the resident went for the test informed BMC officials.Doctors found prescribing swab tests without examining patients could not only lose their licences, but will also face a criminal case under section 188 (disobedience of an order promulgated by a public servant) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Epidemic Act of 1897, the civic body’s notice, issued on Sunday, stated.

20-05-2020||Chandigarh||Reprieve: No power tariff hike for Chandigarh consumers in 2020-21||In a major relief to more than 2 lakh power consumers in Chandigarh, the Joint Electricity Regulatory Commission (JERC) has decided there will be no hike in electricity tariff for 2020-21 fiscal. The charges for electric vehicle charging at designated outlets have also been reduced.Responding to the tariff revision petition of the UT electricity department, the JERC in an order on Tuesday said, “No increase has been made in the retail tariff for existing categories due to standalone revenue surplus in financial year 2020-21.”Giving another relief to the residents, the JERC has directed the UT to stop recovery of the fuel and power purchase cost adjustment (FPPCA) from all consumer categories starting April 1, 2020, till its further orders. The FPPCA charges are imposed on user on quarterly basis, and are in addition to the tariff imposed in the bill. The directions have been issued on account of revenue surplus in 2020-21. The department, however, has been directed to submit the quarterly FPPCA calculation to the JERC for review. In order to promote the use of electric vehicles (EV), the JERC has introduced a single-part tariff for EV charging stations, wherein the demand/fixed charges have been removed and the energy charges have been reduced from ₹4 per kilowatt hour (Kwh) to ₹3.80 per Kwh.The new tariff will be applicable from June 1 and will remain valid till further orders from the JERC.JERC approved tariffThe last increase in the domestic and commercial electricity tariff was in 2018-2019.In the domestic category, the approved rate is ₹2.75 in the slab of 0-150 units, ₹4.80 in the slab of 151-400 unit. In the slab of above 400 units, the rate is ₹5.20 per unit.In the commercial consumer category, there is no change in the rate of ₹5 in the slab between 0-150 units, in slab of 151-400, the rate is ₹5.30 per unit. In above 400 slab, it is ₹5.60 per unit.FIXED CHARGES TO CONTINUEThe JERC has turned down the demand for removing fixed charges component of the electricity bill.In the wake of the losses incurred due to the two-month lockdown period, the commercial units in the city were demanding removal of the fixed charges.The fixed charges are being charged separately, over and above the consumption charges. These charges range from ₹30/kW/month to ₹200/kW/month.The JERC, announcing its decision, stated, “The electricity department has to incur expenditure towards the capacity charges of power purchase and operation and maintenance, which are fixed in contrast to the energy charges which are payable for purchase of energy per unit. These expenses have to be recovered from the consumers and this is done by having a two-part tariff. Thus, the recovery of these expenses from the tariff is also levied on two-part tariff basis.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/reprieve-no-power-tariff-hike-for-chandigarh-consumers-in-2020-21/story-VoaLtYn5L10tqZIadZogLN.html
20-05-2020||City||Zirakpur MC official suspended for ‘misuse of power’||Punjab local bodies department additional chief secretary Sanjay Kumar on Tuesday suspended Zirakpur municipal council executive officer (EO) Manvir Singh Gill for misusing his powers to issue completion certificates to eight major residential-cum-commercial projects in February this year.This comes after chief vigilance officer of the department, Atul Sharma, submitted his report to Kumar, who confirmed that as per the report, the completion certificates were issued by not following the proper procedure.On May 4, HT had reported how Gill, despite having no authority under the relevant rules, issued certificates to major projects that are spread over more than five acres each. One of these projects has been developed over around 21 acres, and Punjab local bodies minister Brahm Mohindra had ordered an inquiry over it.When asked about the completion certificates, Mohindra said, “We will thoroughly probe the before cancellation of the certificates.”According to sources, Zirakpur municipal council officials did not even carry out physical verification of the projects for issuing fire safety no-objection certificate or giving permissions for sewerage and water connections and setting up of sewage treatment plant.Even in May last year, the Punjab and Haryana high court had pulled up the EO over inaction in removing illegal structures within 100 metres of the Chandigarh international airport, while warning him of criminal contempt proceedings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/zirakpur-mc-official-suspended-for-misuse-of-power/story-PV2nsnRMD8sNhOylIoFV2N.html
20-05-2020||Mumbai||Chaos at Mumbai’s Bandra station, again, as 2,000 migrants gather to board Bihar-bound train||In second such incident, more than 2,000 migrant workers gathered near Bandra Terminus around 11.30am on Tuesday morning to board a Bihar-bound Shramik special train.The railways carry a maximum of 1,700 workers in a train. As the message of the train to Bihar spread, workers started to walk towards the terminus along with their luggage, said police. While 1,700 could board, the remaining waited outside the station. The police lathi-charged and dispersed the crowd by 2pm. “The train was scheduled for Purnia. Many people who were not registered and not called by the state authorities gathered on the bridge and the road leading to the station. Registered passengers were checked and allowed to enter the station. The train left Bandra Terminus around noon with 1,700 labourers and their families,” said Ravinder Bhakar, chief PRO, Western Railway.Mumbai Police officers said the crowding was a result of rumours ranging from “the police are allowing people on the train by taking a cut” to “there is more space in train”, “cops have called labourers asking them to reach the station” and “there was a second train in the evening for Bihar”. Manjunath Shinge, deputy commissioner of police, zone 8, said, “We will investigate who spread the rumours and take appropriate action. The workers came from Dadar, Dharavi, Wadala and Mahim.” Pradeep Chavan, DCP GRP, said, “There was another rumour that a train will leave at 4pm.”Rohit Kumar, 18, who used to work at a hotel in Sakinaka and has been unemployed for two months, said, “I came here as I wanted to go to my hometown in Bihar. Someone told me that the police will allow me on the train if I pay them some money.” Ajay Paswan, 23, from Sakinaka, a tea seller, said, “Someone said there was more space on the train.” Jabbar Ansari, 48, who sells clothes in Bandra (East), said, “There was a rumour that there was another train at 4pm and it’s on first-come-first-served basis, so I reached the railway station.” “I got a call from the police saying that I will be allowed to board the train on Tuesday and that my turn has come. The police said they would give me the details about the train, but I got no call. When I came to know about the train leaving from Bandra Terminus I came to the station. However, I could not board,” said MD Ahmed, resident of Bihar.On April 14, hundreds of migrant workers had turned up at Bandra station, demanding trains to take them home. The Western Railway has since operated over 582 Shramik trains for migrant workers towards Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand.(Inputs from Suraj Ojha)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chaos-at-mumbai-s-bandra-station-again-as-2-000-migrants-gather-to-board-bihar-bound-train/story-Ea6zzkcvEfN6NI6hegHbRJ.html
20-05-2020||Chandigarh||Local bus service to restart in Chandigarh by May 21||The Chandigarh Transport Undertaking (CTU) will be starting its local bus service by May 21.With the city entering phase four of the Covid-19 lockdown, the UT administration in its order issued on Monday allowed plying of both local and interstate public transport. However, on Tuesday, CTU buses remained off road on both city and long routes, as both the interstate bus terminals (ISBTs) have been to put to alternative use — the Sector 26 vegetable market has been temporarily shifted to the Sector 17 ISBT, while at the ISBT-43, arrangements have been made for transportation of migrant workers to the railway station.The holding centre setup for migrant persons at the ISBT-43 is being shifted to the Chandigarh College of Engineering Technology (CCET), Sector 26, and the bus stand will be handed over once again to the UT transport department. The department has also requested the administration to vacate the ISBT-17 so that bus services can be resumed from there too.“The department is making efforts so that CTU buses are started by May 21. We will be starting the service from the ISBT-43 first,” said Uma Shankar Gupta, director, transport. First, 15 to 20 buses will be started, and the number will increase gradually. The timings and routes for CTU buses are being worked out by the department and will be made public in a day or two.For starting local bus to all areas of the tricity – Panchkula, Chandigarh and Mohali — and interstate bus service, the department has written to Punjab and Haryana for their consent. According to the central government’s Lockdown 4.0 guidelines, buses on interstate routes can be run only after consent is taken from all states concerned.All buses will run with 50% capacity and will be sanitized after every trip. There will be volunteers with thermal screening at the bus terminals to screen the passengers before boarding.HOLDING CENTRE FOR MIGRANT PERSONS SHIFTEDConsidering that the movement of CTU buses will commence shortly from ISBT-43, the holding centres for migrant persons will now operate from the Chandigarh College of Engineering Technology (CCET), Sector 26 . The stranded persons are required to reach there to avail themselves of the Shramik special train facility.AK Sinha, UT finance secretary, said that 10 more Shramik trains have been planned for carrying migrant labour and stranded persons from Chandigarh.The destinations include Motihari, Gaya, Madhapura, Ara, Danapur and Chapra in Bihar, Dhanbad in Jharkhand, and Lucknow, Moradabad, Shahajanpur, Sultanpur, Khagaria, Jounpur and Hardoi in Uttar Pradesh.However, there will be no train on May 20 and 21.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/local-bus-service-to-restart-in-chandigarh-by-may-21/story-kVnRzIYxjYg3VMmFIWMDEL.html

20-05-2020||Mumbai||Lowest on the list so far, five city wards to soon touch 500-case mark||Five wards--T ward (Mulund), RN ward (Dahisar), C Ward (Marine Lines), B Ward (Dongri) and RC ward (Borivli)--that had the lowest number of Covid-19 cases in the city are now inching towards the 500-mark. The growth has been fastest in T ward, with 216 cases last week but now they stand at 413.According to BMC officials, the doubling rate in Mulund is currently around seven days that has to be increased to 10 days on a priority. The rise in cases in the area has links to slums, majorly in Indira Nagar, followed by several cases having a connection to the APMC market and the clearing agents of Mumbai Port who have contributed to the spike. BMC said that many from the trading community, involved in essential services, spread the virus amongst their families which also contributed to the increase. Kishore Gandhi, assistant municipal commissioner, T Ward, said, “The doubling rate is currently seven days and we have to increase it to break the chain. The outbreak that was earlier reported in slums is now much under control, however, the priority is to contain the virus in residential housing societies. Citizens have to cooperate and stay indoors to break the chain.”In Mulund, out of the total 413 cases, 116 have been cured followed by 10 deaths. About 66 buildings were sealed and there were 15 containment zones in the area.The civic body is also setting up a quarantine facility of around 115 beds near Mulund check naka on the land that was being used for octroi naka. Mihir Kotecha, BJP MLA from Mulund said, “The facility is being made ready. It will be up for use in the next 48 hours.”According to BMC’s data last week, T Ward and RN ward that includes Dahisar and parts of Borivli, have growth rates of 18% and 11% respectively. RN Ward that had the lowest number of cases, had 192 till Monday compared to 101 on May 12, followed by C Ward including Marine Lines and Kalbadevi, with 234 cases till Monday compared to 134 on May 12. Further, at R Central Ward (Borivli) there were 221 cases on May 12 followed by 347 on Tuesday.At B ward (Dongri), cases rose from 184 on May 12 to 221 on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/lowest-on-the-list-so-far-five-city-wards-to-soon-touch-500-case-mark/story-VEaSGPoJEJ8oh2XB5l6kOM.html
20-05-2020||Chandigarh||Businessman Oberoi secures freedom for 11 Punjabi youths facing murder charges in Dubai||Twelve Indians and two Pakistanis, who were facing murder charges in Dubai, have been saved by Indian businessman and philanthropist SP Singh Oberoi, who made arrangements for the blood money to secure their release. According to Oberoi, 11 of the 14 youths (including two Pakistanis), returned on Monday while three are expected to reach India in the coming days. Five of the 12 Indians are from Gurdaspur, two from SBS Nagar, two from Kapurthala, one each from Jalandhar and Hoshiarpur, and one from Kurukshetra district in Haryana. According to a press release issued by Sarbat Da Bhala Charitable Trust run by Oberoi, a clash between two groups broke out in Sharjah on December 31, 2015, in which 23-year-old Ashif Ali of Samrai town in Jalandhar district and 25-year-old Varinderpal Singh of Pandoori village of Kapurthala district were killed. Fourteen youths were charged with the double murder and sent to jail in Dubai on January 1, 2016. Oberoi said the family members of the accused youths had approached him for help. “After finding that some of the youths were the only breadwinners of their families, I approached Nirmal Singh, a relative of victim Varinderpal, and apprised him of the pitiable situation of the family members of the accused,” he said. On May 21, 2018, Oberoi took Nirmal Singh to the Dubai court and told the judge that the family members of the victims were ready for a “compromise”.Oberoi said after getting a nod from the court, he handed over around ₹65 lakh blood money to the victims’ families in July 2018 and submitted the relevant papers. “After this, I attended 27 hearings. In total, ₹75 lakh, including the blood money, was spent on the case. A part of the money was paid by the families of the accused youths,” he said. He also said they had filed the appeal for the youths’ release in February 2020 and the court decided to release them in April this year. The nine Indian-returnees have been quarantined for 14 days at the Military Hospital in Chennai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/businessman-oberoi-secures-freedom-for-11-punjabi-youths-facing-murder-charges-in-dubai/story-A1UfDFV4OItVBSguionEDJ.html
20-05-2020||Mumbai||State is not handling crisis well: Maharashtra BJP||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Tuesday led a delegation to Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari to submit a complaint against the state government’s handling of the Covid-19 outbreak.The delegation, led by Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis, has demanded that the state should announce a fiscal package for daily wage earners as they have been worst hit by the pandemic.“Every day, the situation is getting worse in the state. Maharashtra has the maximum number of cases as well as fatalities due to the novel coronavirus disease. It’s an alarming situation. In a city like Mumbai, patients can’t get hospital beds or ambulance services. Some have died while trying to shift from one hospital to another,’’ said Fadnavis, after meeting the Governor.He added, “Farmers are in a dire situation with their rabi harvest remaining unsold. Migrant labourers are walking back home while risking their lives. We have made several representations to the government about these issues.”Fadnavis also said that instead of writing to Prime Minister Narendra Modi all the time, NCP chief Sharad Pawar should sometimes write to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to help the common people.The move is part of BJP’s ‘Maharashtra Bachao’ (Save Maharashtra) protest, launched on Tuesday, to highlight the state’s ‘ineffectual tackling’ of Covid-19. As part of the protest, party leaders will be sending similar representations at the district level to collectors. On Wednesday, BJP will hold a demonstration, where party workers will hold protest slates against the government, outside their houses.However, Congress alleged that the BJP was trying to play politics amidst a pandemic.Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant said, “This is not ‘Maharashtra Bachao’ but a ‘Maharashtra Virodhi’ (Anti Maharashtra) protest by the opposition party. Fadnavis said that he did not see any efforts taken by the state to send migrant labourers home. For his information, we have sent 2.3 lakh labourers in 19,353 state undertaking buses.’’He also alleged that Maharashtra BJP’s official Twitter account had released a one-month-old video about a protest in a local Shushrusha hospital to create animosity and anger amongst the public.“The home minister should take action against them for releasing old videos with an agenda to create trouble,’’ Sawant added.Fadnavis said, “I do not know about the video and if this is indeed an old video released mischievously, we will take action against the concerned member. We don’t want to do politics amidst a pandemic.’’||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/state-is-not-handling-crisis-well-maharashtra-bjp/story-bxlFCFog3aygURRq9rqRuJ.html
20-05-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC strikes down payment of ₹303 cr to firm for Balganga dam works||In a major reprieve for City and Industrial Development Corporation (CIDCO) and the Konkan Irrigation Development Corporation (KIDC), the Bombay high court on Tuesday struck down a decision directing them to pay a sum of Rs 303 crore to FA Enterprises towards unpaid bills for construction of Balganga dam in Raigad district.Justice RD Dhanuka struck down the arbitral award dated April 3, 2019, on the ground that it was patently illegal and legally unsustainable. The judge noted FA Enterprises could not prove most of its claims independently, but the majority members (three out of five) of the tribunal accepted the claims on the basis of communications issued by some KIDC officers, who are under the cloud of suspicion.In January 2009, the government decided to construct Balganga dam at Niphad in Pen tehsil of Raigad district for catering drinking water requirements of some CIDCO areas and therefore CIDCO was to fund the project, initially estimated to cost Rs 353.89 crore. However, five months later the work was allotted to FA Enterprises for Rs 495.45 crore and on June 10, 2011, the cost of the project was revised to Rs 1,220 crore. The dispute started the same year after CIDCO officers started disputing the project cost and appointed the body’s own experts to ascertain the cost.FA Enterprises had then moved high court invoking the arbitration clause in its agreement with the authorities. Accordingly, the arbitral panel was formed, comprising one representative each of the state government, KIDC, the CIDCO and FA Enterprises. The presiding member was appointed by the high court.The contractor had claimed an amount of Rs 536.56 crore, including Rs 186.89 crore towards a particular bill. Both KIDC and CIDCO had strenuously opposed the claim.On April 3, 2019, three members of the tribunal passed a majority award directing the KIDC to pay to the claimant a sum of Rs 303 crore to the contractor firm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-strikes-down-payment-of-303-cr-to-firm-for-balganga-dam-works/story-3jZeKhRYH3heB2GoT2Yh4I.html
20-05-2020||City||1991 ABDUCTION CASE: 4 retired cops get anticipatory bail, directed to join investigation||A local court on Tuesday granted anticipatory bail to four retired policemen, booked along with former Punjab director general of police (DGP) Sumedh Singh Saini in a case related to the disappearance of Balwant Singh Multani, a Chandigarh Industrial and Tourism Corporation (CITCO) employee, in 1991.The court of additional district and sessions judge Monika Goyal also directed the accused -- sub-inspectors Har Sahai Sharma, Jagir Singh and Anoop Singh, and assistant sub-inspector Kuldip Singh -- to join investigation within seven days and furnish personal bail bonds of Rs 50,000 with one surety each.They have been asked to surrender their passports and not to leave the country without prior permission of the court.Saini has already joined investigations after getting anticipatory bail from the court last week.“The case is more than 29 years old and the complainant kept mum for such a long time. The custodial interrogation of the applicants is not required,” the court ruled.Defence counsel HS Dhanoa had contended that all the four cops had retired from Chandigarh Police with “unblemished carrier” of about 37-38 years. The court in its order said, “Prima facie all the accused had acted as per law and conducted the proceedings in the FIR, but whether they were part of the bigger conspiracy, in which Balwant Singh Multani was picked up illegally and was afterwards eliminated is matter of evidence.”The court also pointed out that since December 7, 2011 (when the Supreme Court dismissed the case against Saini), no action has been taken by any family member of the victim.COURT QUESTIONS REGISTRATION OF FIR IN MATAUR“The allegations against the applicants (accused retired policemen) pertain to their act and conduct at police station Sector 17, Chandigarh, or at police station Qadian, thus there are serious doubts regarding the jurisdiction of police station Mataur,” the court said.Multani was allegedly picked up by two officers after a terrorist attack on Saini, then SSP, Chandigarh, in which four policemen in his security posse were killed. The police later claimed that Multani had escaped from the custody of Qadian police.A case was registered under Sections 364 (kidnapping or abduction in order to murder), 201 (causing disappearance of evidence), 344 (wrongful confinement), 330 (voluntarily causing hurt to exhort confession) and 120 (B) (criminal conspiracy) in Mohali on May 6 on the basis of a complaint filed by Multani’s brother Palwinder Singh Multani.Former DGP Saini, former DSP Baldev Singh Saini, inspector Satvir Singh, then sub-inspectors Har Sahai Sharma, Jagir Singh and Anoop Singh, and then ASI Kuldip Singh were booked in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/1991-abduction-case-4-retired-cops-get-anticipatory-bail-directed-to-join-investigation/story-IbXMPCnkCD7eQMVayOx7CI.html

20-05-2020||City||Locust attack alert leaves Punjab cotton, paddy growers worried||An alert by the Union agriculture ministry of a possible locust attack in Punjab, particularly the Malwa region, in the coming months has sent the cotton and paddy growers into a tizzy. The Locust Warning Organisation (LWO), a subsidiary of the central ministry, has identified Fazilka district, which shares the boundary with the neighbouring state of Rajasthan as well as Pakistan, as the most vulnerable to attacks by swarms of migratory pests that target vegetation. KL Gurjar, LWO deputy director and national coordinator on mitigating locust attacks, said the Sarwar Khuian block in Fazilka is under the constant watch of the state and central agencies.He said the swarms of locusts are invading from Pakistan as a result of which Rajasthan districts such as Barmer, Jaipur, Jaisalmer and Sriganganagar have been hit.“The Sarwar Khuian area near Abohar town has faced at least five locust attacks since April 11 and it may escalate in the next three months. Presently, movement of the locust is spotted from Rajasthan towards Neemuch in Madhya Pradesh. The agriculture authorities in Punjab have been sounded about the possibility of locust invasion,” said Gurjar.Gurjar said farmers should avoid using drum beats or other means to chase away locusts during the night hours.“Locusts have a natural tendency to rest on trees at night and then attack crops in the daytime. If farmers allow locust to settle at one place, the pest can be eliminated effectively with pesticides. Presently, immature locusts are active and they can harm vegetation,” he added.Fazilka chief agriculture officer Manjit Singh said of about 50,000 hectare land under cultivation in Sarwar Khuian, cotton is sown on 36,000 hectares. “It is a matter of concern as cotton is being sown in the area and swarm attack on growing plants will impact the farmers. Following the LWO advisory, the district administration has roped in the Border Security Force (BSF) to maintain a constant watch to eliminate locusts. A sizeable cultivable land in Sarwar Khuian is located across the border fence and pest control measures have been taken,” he added.State agriculture director Sutantar Kumar Airi said the department will provide ample stock of pesticides at the district level this week.“We are ready for any emergency situation caused by locust swarms. A special monitoring team is working in Fazilka in coordination with teams of Rajasthan and central agencies,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/locust-attack-alert-leaves-punjab-cotton-paddy-growers-worried/story-4sOhWnjdN7t9wzqaImoL1I.html
20-05-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Another day of over 2,000 cases in state; tally 37,136||Maharashtra on Tuesday continued to record more than 2,000 coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases as it registered 2,127 new infections, taking the total to 37,136. According to officials, reconciliation of figures with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) portal is still in process, resulting in a difference in the cumulative figures.The state also registered 76 deaths, bringing its toll to 1,325. However, 32 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours, while the remaining 44 happened between April 30 and May 16, the state health department said.Of the new cases, Mumbai recorded 1,411 new infections, taking the city tally to 22,746. while Thane, Navi Mumbai and Pune recorded 112, 122 and 139 new infections, respectively.On Tuesday, Maharashtra also saw its highest number of discharges in a single day with 1,202 people sent home after recovery, the state health department said. So far, 9,639 people have recovered and discharged from the hospitals. State health minister Rajesh Tope said that the recovery rate of Maharashtra is 25%.The state has added 21,020 Covid-19 cases in the past 14 days. It also clocked over 2,000 cases in the past three consecutive days. An average of 1,500 cases daily is added during the two-week period.Maharashtra is witnessing a significant rise in Covid-19 cases since May 6, as it has been reporting over 1,000 cases on a daily basis. But the health department official denied that the state has reached the community transmission stage yet as the growth in cases is not exponential.A senior health department official said that another incubation cycle is underway, which has led to a spike in number. “There is another 14-day incubation cycle till around May 31. The spike will come under control and the curve could start to go down after that,” the official, who wished to remain anonymous, said.Meanwhile, the Maharashtra government on Tuesday announced categorisation of various areas into red and non-red zones for the purpose of allowing or restricting business and other activities during the fourth phase of the lockdown till May 31 in view of the coronavirus pandemic. It also issued guidelines for these zones that would come into effect from May 22. Earlier, districts in the state were categorized into three zones-- red, orange and green.The municipal corporations within the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) —that includes Mumbai, Thane and the surrounding areas — as well as civic bodies of Pune, Solapur, Aurangabad, Malegaon, Nashik, Dhule, Jalgaon, Akola and Amravati fall in the red zone, the order said. While the remaining areas of the state are categoriSed as non-red zone and have been give more relaxation in terms of opening up businesses and other activities.Tope said that the restrictions in red zone have not been relaxed as the cases are increasing on a daily basis. “In red zone, we have kept curbs as they were because today’s cases are reported from several containment areas of the red zone. Public transport, Metro, inter-district buses, among others, are still not operational across both categories. The only change in the red zone is that people can now order food for takeaway from restaurants in the red zone,” Tope said in a Facebook Live address.While the revised guidelines don’t allow malls and shops selling non-essentials to open in red zones, e-commerce activity for essential and non-essential items is allowed. Private offices are not allowed to reopen in red zones and only 5 % of the staff are allowed in government offices.The state government is currently focused on reviving economic activities in the state that had come to a grinding halt in the past 50 days. Industries and other business activities have been opened in the non-red zone area of the state.“Industries should begin. And therefore in the non-red zone, we have opened up mostly all industries and other businesses. However, precautions have to be taken; social distancing, masks etc. Bus travel within the district is allowed. Within the non-red zone, private vehicle movement is also allowed, except between 7pm and 7am. Restaurants, shops, workplaces, among others, in non-red zone can remain open,” Tope said. However, public gatherings, religious gatherings are still not allowed in the non-red zone too.The minister said that barring Mumbai, the health infrastructure to treat Covid-19 patients is up to the mark and there is no shortage of the beds. “Even in Mumbai, the ICU beds currently are equal to existing number of patients. Keeping the potential shortage in mind, we are augmenting the bed availability in the city to 1 lakh beds from the existing capacity of 60,000 with the help of additional facilities at BKC, Worli and Goregaon. The bed capacity in the Dedicated Covid Health Centres (DCHC) in the city will be ramped up to 15,000 and the number of ICU beds will rise to 2,000. We have issued the notification, making it mandatory to the private hospitals to use 80% of their beds for Covid-19 patients at the rates decided by rate control laws,” he said.Tope said that the state was roping in private medical practitioners to ramp up the availability of the expertise. He said that the committee headed by the chief secretary has been coordinating with private doctors and their organisations for roping in their services ahead of the monsoon.The minister said that the chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has given them permission to fill up vacant posts in public health, medical education and health departments of the civic bodies and the process will soon begin. “We will recruit the doctors and health workers, including 17,000 in the public health department, in the next couple of months,” he said.Tope asserted that although the number of patients is on the continuous rise, there was no need to worry as the mortality rate has dropped to 3.2% and the doubling rate has improved to more than 14 days. “The recovery rate, too, has reached 25% as 9,639 patients have been discharged till today after their full recovery. The high rate of addition of the patients is owing to the highest number of tests being conducted in the state. We have a daily capacity of 15,000 tests through 67 laboratories,” he said.He has also warned people against the ill treatment accorded to patients or the people travelling from the cities like Mumbai and Pune.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-another-day-of-over-2-000-cases-in-state-tally-37-136/story-V4YaBfIVgwrpvCys1oLXQM.html

20-05-2020||City||ASI tells judge ‘cops have right to thrash accused’, gets notice||Taking exception to the statement of an assistant sub-inspector (ASI) that “police have every right to give beatings to the accused at the time of his arrest”, the additional district and sessions judge, Jalandhar, on Tuesday issued a show-cause notice to the cop for display of intemperate conduct in the courtroom.The incident took place when the judge, Parminder Singh Grewal, was hearing the anticipatory bail plea of Parminder Kumar Mehmi, father of Amol Mehmi who allegedly dragged Mulak Raj, an ASI, on his car bonnet on May 2 during curfew. Amol, who was arrested earlier, was granted bail on May 13. Parminder Kumar along with his son was charged with attempt to murder and sections. On Tuesday, ASI Surjit Singh, who brought case file to the court, made the remark when the judge asked him whether the police beat Amol Mehmi up at the time of his arrest.The judge also found that the ASI spoke in a loud manner as if he was shouting in the courtroom. The court directed Surjit Singh to file the reply on the next date of hearing on May 21 as to why necessary legal proceedings should not be initiated against him.The judge also directed Jalandhar police commissioner Gurpreet Singh Bhullar to depute a responsible official not below the rank of a superintendent of police (SP) to assist the court in the case as “lower rank officials like ASI Surjit Singh do not know how to behave”. The court observed ASI Surjit’s behaviour was highly reprehensible which is not expected from a member of the police force. “It also shows that the cop has no regard for the rule of law and he considered that he and police are law unto themselves,” the judge said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/asi-tells-judge-cops-have-right-to-thrash-accused-gets-notice/story-q1GFqQlkpfd5pVUqSi7p5H.html

20-05-2020||City||Missing liquor case: Haryana probe team visits Sonepat godown, police recount bottles||The three member special enquiry team (SET) formed to investigate the missing liquor case visited the Kharkhauda godown on Tuesday.The state government had constituted the SET after 5,500 boxes of liquor went missing from the godown owned by illicit liquor kingpin Bhupinder Singh’s mother two weeks ago.Investigation head TC Gupta, along with additional director general of police (vigilance) Subhash Yadav and additional excise and taxation commissioner Vijay Singh, inspected some files related to the case at the excise and taxation office, said Sonepat superintendent of police Jashandeep Randhawa.A police officer said the SET sought the record of total seized liquor stored at the godown and the quantity that went missing during the lockdown from the excise and taxation officials.The three-member probe team and Sonepat police are probing the role of some liquor traders, two former SHOs, some policemen and excise officials in the scam. Two former Kharkhauda SHOs, who were suspended two weeks ago for their alleged role in the case, are on the run, and the police are trying to nab them. The SET will have to submit its report by May 30 to the state government.SP Randhawa said the SET has asked the police to recount the bottles at the Kharkhauda godown.“The police will be done recounting the liquor bottles at the godown in three to four days,” the SP added.Four days ago, the main accused in the case, Bhupinder Singh, who was in police custody, was admitted to the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Rohtak, after he complained of chest pain.“During interrogation, the accused had revealed that he along with few other traders used to bring liquor from Punjab’s Rajpura at low rates and sell the same using fake labels in other parts of the country. The liquor traders confessed that they used to print fake bills for the liquor consignments and that some cops were also involved in the scam,” the police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/missing-liquor-case-haryana-probe-team-visits-sonepat-godown-police-recount-bottles/story-ETapAqimlRDzyDUHMZfruN.html

20-05-2020||Mumbai||Curbs to stay in Maharashtra red zones||Two days after the Centre issued guidelines for the fourth phase of the lockdown which began on May 18, the Maharashtra government extended more relaxations to rural and semi-urban areas, excluding them from the existing red zones. The existing orange and green zones are now ‘non-red zones’ and almost all activities in these areas have been opened up, state health minister Rajesh Tope said. While commercial and other activities are allowed in non-red zones, the restrictions imposed earlier will continue in red zones. The revised guidelines will come into existence from May 22.The earlier colour-coded classification of district-level red zones has now been changed to municipal corporation level, restricting it to urban areas. While 18 of the 27 municipal corporations are in the red zone, the remaining are in non-red or green and orange zones, where more commercial and industrial activities are allowed. During the third lockdown, between May 4 and 17, 14 districts were in red zones with greater restrictions on activities. The change in the policy has brought down the population percentage in these zones from 6,55,82,498 (population of 12 districts) to 2,90,79,892 (population of 18 corporations according to 2011 census.)The 18 municipal corporations include nine from the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (Mumbai, Thane, Kalyan-Dombivli, Navi Mumbai, Vasai-Virar, Panvel, Mira-Bhayandar, Bhiwandi-Nizampur and Ulhasnagar), and Pune, Solapur, Aurangabad, Malegaon, Nashik, Dhule, Jalgaon, Akola and Amravati.Red zones will continue to have stricter curbs, with only essential activities being allowed, besides a few non-essential activities, including a limited number of standalone shops, e-commerce of both essential and non-essential goods. Nagpur, Pimpri-Chinchwad, Nanded-Waghala, Kolhapur, Sangli-Miraj-Kupwada, Latur, Ahmednagar,Chandrapur, Parbhani the corporations are in non-red zones. A few corporations including Dhule, Jalgaon, Akola and Amravati have been added to the red zone list because of the surge in the cases, while Pimpri-Chinchwad has been excluded due to containment of the spread.Private offices will continue to remain shut in red zones, but will open in non-red zones. Government offices in red zones may operate at 5% staff and at full capacity in non-red zones. Containment zones are to be earmarked by municipal corporations and district collectors. It is mandatory for the district, civic authorities to consult with the chief secretary to earmark larger areas as the state wants containment zones restricted to only affected areas such as building, colony, mohalla.Malls and industrial units, which are not allowed to operate in red zones, will be allowed to carry out their maintenance and monsoon-related upkeep by keeping them open. “Industrial activities in non-red zones have been fully allowed, while other activities too are mostly been allowed. The curbs in red and containment zones will remain. People are expected to maintain the health protocols strictly in public and workplaces in the zones with relaxed curbs,” Tope said.Based on the guidelines issued by the Centre on Sunday, the state has allowed sports complexes, stadia and public open spaces in non-red zones to operate, except for group activities and entry of spectators. Intra-district activities in these zones have been allowed with a maximum 50% of passengers. The state is expected to take a call on inter-district transportation in these zones in the next few days. Markets and shops in these areas have been allowed to operate between 9am and 5pm.Liquor shops as well as non-essential shops have not been allowed in Mumbai. “Autorickshaw and taxi, aggregator services remain prohibited in red zones. Two- and four-wheelers are allowed only for essential services with the occupancy of 1 and 2+1 travellers respectively. Home delivery of essential, non-essential items by e-commerce services and food items by hotel and restaurants is allowed,” the order stated. “Using the power given under the central guidelines, we have narrowed the areas of red zones and freed up more area, which are not much affected. These areas will have more commercial-industrial activities. Inter-state transport facilities are unlikely to be allowed until May 31,” said an official from the state government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/curbs-to-stay-in-maharashtra-red-zones/story-YNyrdqfWJU4NCTWL5TwbYI.html
20-05-2020||Lucknow||IIT-K may begin animal trial of corona vaccine next month||The scientists of the department of Biological Science and Bioengineering at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT-K) who are developing an anti-corona vaccine, are likely to begin trial on animals next month. If the results are satisfactory, human trials would start in the next four months.IIT-K director professor Abhay Karindkar said that the work was presently in the research stage. But soon the research was expected to be completed.According to the professor in-charge of the Innovation and Incubation Cell of the IIT-K professor Amit Bandhyopadhyaya, two scientists of the bioengineering department, professor Sarvanan Matheswaran and professor Debendu Kumar Dass were carrying out research for developing two types of vaccines to check corona virus for the past two months.“The research has come to a stage when the developed vaccine would be put on trial on animals by next month. The discussion with the scientists of other Institutes is in progress for animal trial,” he added.In case the results proved satisfactory, necessary measures would be taken for its trial on human beings in the next four months.According to professor Amitabh, the scientists were developing two kinds of vaccines. One of the vaccines would produce anti bodies in human beings to check the corona infection and to fight it out .The other vaccine would effectively check the mutation of corona virus into different strains. At present most of the scientists were busy in developing anti-corona vaccine but they had not started research in this direction, he added. The spikes of corona 19 virus have S-1 and S-2 protein through which it comes into contact of human beings. The IIT-K scientists were working on S-2 protein, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/iit-k-may-begin-animal-trial-of-corona-vaccine-next-month/story-kkvJqnxbh7z8QV2BXzT8kO.html

Kapurthala police had arrested the accused ASI and his friend Mangu for murder and cop was terminated from service.Khaira, however, said it was not enough and the chief minister should sympathise with the family and interact with them personally before announcing a government job for the Arvinderjit’s kin and injured friend with ₹1 crore compensation.Last week, inspector general of police (Jalandhar range) along with Kapurthala senior superintendent of police and family members of the deceased had held a joint press conference to counter the social media campaign against the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/khaira-demands-1-crore-govt-job-for-slain-kabaddi-player-s-kin/story-QMMVnXZTdlpzZjekhHDVTP.html
20-05-2020||Chandigarh||Ggm man moves Delhi HC, says Saral Haryana portal not user-friendly||Raising doubts on the efficiency of Saral Haryana web portal, used for issuing electronic passes for inter-state movement between Delhi and Haryana, a Gurgaon resident on Tuesday filed an intervention application in the Delhi high court seeking directions to Haryana government to allow the inter-state movement of advocates on identity cards issued by bar associations.The matter will be heard on Wednesday by a Delhi HC division bench of Justices Hima Kohli and Subramonium Prasad.Following an undertaking given by the Haryana government on May 14 that e-passes for inter-state movement of all persons engaged in providing essential services, including medical professionals, will be issued within 30 minutes of the receipt of the application, the Delhi high court had disposed of a public interest litigation (PIL). Each e-pass will be valid for the entire duration of the lockdown and can be used for multiple visits, the state government told the HC.The PIL had sought court directions to stop the Haryana government from restricting the inter-state movement of medical professionals.The applicant, Govind Swaroop Chaturvedi, a lawyer who practices in Delhi said in his intervening application that he was residing in Gurugram and has his chamber at Patiala House in New Delhi where his files have been lying consequent to sudden lockdown announced on March 23. Chaturvedi said in his application that since he was being stopped from entering Delhi without a movement pass, he tried to apply for electronic movement pass on May 18 at www.saralharyana.gov.in. However, he could not succeed even after wasting more than one and a half hours.“The website is not user-friendly. While uploading the identity card in pdf format from a laptop, the Saral Haryana website asks for uploading image files only. However, when the same was tried from a mobile phone, the website said that file size should be less than 500 KB,’’ the application reads.It is submitted that when the applicant asked his colleagues in Gurugram, it came to the fore that they also could not apply. In their case, the website itself did not open, the application said. Chaturvedi said he had tried to apply for an e-pass in April also but faced similar problems and could not even submit the application. If the same is not going to facilitate the movement of the majority of the affected advocates, no purpose is going to be achieved by the statement of the Haryana government before the HC.“Directions be given to the Haryana government to allow the vehicles of advocates in the national capital region (NCR) with stickers of bar associations of Delhi to enter the UT. This should be done instead of applying for an e-pass, which a cumbersome and difficult process requiring technical help. Additionally, valid identity cards of the advocates issued by bar associations could also be checked to allow entry,’’ the application said.The applicant said as per the new norms announced for the fourth phase of the lockdown, even inter-state buses are going to be operated by the Haryana government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ggm-man-moves-delhi-hc-says-saral-haryana-portal-not-user-friendly/story-S9emFzXSk64NZi1dgVG1cO.html

The remaining hail from other states. The chartered flight, run by the ICE air operations, an air transportation arm of the US agency entrusted with the task to remove illegal migrants from the American soil, landed at 4pm at the Amritsar airport, where they were screened by the health department.As many as 92 Indian immigrants were detained by the US Customs and Border Protection personnel in Texas after they illegally entered the US from Mexico. There were 21 detentions from New York, and 22 each from Atlanta and San Francisco.Ajnala SDM Deepak Bhatia said all passengers are being sent to their respective districts in Punjab and those belonging to other states will be taken away by vehicles of their respective states.He said that everyone will be quarantined in their respective states and districts. “As many as 21 men have been taken to Swami Vivekanand Drug De-addiction and Rehabilitation Centre, a government quarantine centre in Amritsar for now. From here, youths of other regions will be sent to their respective districts,” said an official.PARENTS SEEK ACTION AGAINST TRAVEL AGENTSMother of Meetkamal Singh, 20, of Bholath in Kapurthala district, said, “A travel agent gave us assurance that he will take my son to Mexico from where he will help him enter the US and charged Rs 26 Lakh. My son went to Mexico on a six-month visitor visa on April 25. He told us that he crossed over to the US side by jumping the wall at border. However, he and others were caught.”“He told us that he was kept at a checkpost and the US personnel had asked him to be ready to be deported,” she said.“I am not concerned about the loss of money. I’m happy that my son has returned home safe. But he had to spend days in the US government’s custody under tough circumstances. He told us over the phone that he was beaten up. I appeal to all parents not to send their wards to the US in any illegal way through these travel agents,” she added.Father of another youth, Gursewak Singh of Mukatsar, said, “Strict action should be taken against the travel agent who charged Rs 21 Lakh from us and Rs 1 lakh extra for returning my son’s passport.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/us-deports-167-illegal-indian-immigrants-through-special-flight/story-pSG7mY5rvZVH1eFo0CHGuO.html
20-05-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab launches community transmission surveillance programme in four districts||The Punjab health department on Tuesday began collecting blood samples from people in four vulnerable districts under the ‘Community Transmission Surveillance Programme’ for conducting their ‘rapid antibody tests’ to find if the community transmission stage of Covid-19 has started in the state.As a part of a nationwide survey initiated by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), the health department decided to collect samples from four districts of Punjab—Patiala, Ludhiana, Jalandhar and Gurdaspur, which have the maximum number of Covid-19 cases.“Punjab health department will send 400 samples from each district to the Chennai-based National Institute for Research to monitor the trends of the Covid-19 in community transmission. The blood samples will be tested through rapid antibody test kits and ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) test kits, developed by the National Institute of Virology, Pune,” said state health department spokesperson for Covid-19, Dr Rajesh Bhaskar.He added, “The department has collected 400 samples from Patiala while collection of samples in Ludhiana is in process. In the next phase, blood samples will be collected from Jalandhar, followed by Gurdaspur.”“We plan to complete the survey in a month. These four districts have been chosen as most of the cases reported in these areas were cases of community spread. Amritsar, with highest number of Covid-19 cases, was not included in the survey as most of the cases in the district pertained to Nanded-returnees and were not related to community spread,” Dr Bhaskar said.He said the state has also conducted random sampling in each district to find out if Covid-19 is spreading in community or not. On daily basis, over 100 people are being tested randomly in each district through pool testing, he added.“This survey is to understand how the transmission of infection has been so far and how it is taking place in the later stages. This will also reveal if a person, whose sample is being tested, was ever infected by Covid-19 or not. Even if the person is found negative, the study can show if he or she was infected with the disease in the last 20 days or not,” Dr Bhaskar said“Since most Covid-19 positive people in the country were asymptomatic, this survey will also help us find out if coronavirus has affected the healthy people, who do not know if they are infected. This will also give an idea about the transmission based on gender, age and socio-economic characteristics,” a health official, seeking anonymity, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-launches-community-transmission-surveillance-programme-in-four-districts/story-1wU8UfHvZ6TAh4SjduCKGJ.html

Khan and his family were seen trudging along the highway in the scorching heat, near Chilar Phata, in Boisar.Khan served water to the workers at construction sites, for a living, whereas his wife and daughter lifted bricks and sand. “We earn Rs 1,200 per day. But the lockdown has rendered us jobless. We don’t have any money now even to survive,” he said.Khan moved to Mumbai in 2000. He worked in a factory as a labourer, but he lost his right leg in an accident. He was then thrown out of the job.On May 3, Khan and his family had applied for e-passes with the help of a friend, but due to technical reasons, his application was rejected. As he did not have the transit passes, the family was unable to board a train to UP from Vasai Road station.“We even contacted a trucker who agreed to drop us at the Kanpur border, but he charged Rs 5,000 per person. So, we decided to walk instead,” Khan said.Khan’s wife and daughter take turns in pushing the wheelchair. “It is tough for them, but we have no other alternative,” said Khan.The family plans to cover the 1,300 km distance in a span of 27 days. They have decided on covering only 50-60 km a day and rest under the shades of trees or in musafir khana (transit homes) if we are allowed entry. “I just pray that the wheelchair does not fail me. It has been loyal to me since the past 15 years. It would be difficult to get a spare part on the way, as all shops are shut. I want to die in my village. At least there I will get a decent burial in the presence of my relatives,” said Khan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/better-to-die-in-my-ancestral-village-says-man-walking-1-300km-with-kin/story-98efsFAV4rZWtk4V9fQxTI.html

The centre has been set up at the meeting hall of MC headquarters (Zone A) office near Mata Rani Chowk.MC commissioner Kanwalpreet Kaur Brar said a team of 70 officials had been deputed at the call centre. She said, “The labourers register themselves on the government portal, www.covidhelp.punjab.gov.in, for moving back to their home states. Once the registration is made and migrants are selected, then calls are made to the shortlisted passengers.” She said the centre was also informing the administration about the actual number of people willing to travel to their home states. “As industrial activity has commenced in the city, several migrants, who had registered themselves to go back home, have dropped the idea and returned to their jobs,” said Brar. Brar said 10 special trains for labourers departed from Ludhiana for different destinations on Tuesday, and the number of trains will increase to 12 from Wednesday onwards. Each train ferries around 1,200 passengers.She said the Punjab government was paying for travel, food, water and pick-up service from designated points. The medical screening of all passengers was being done and a medical certificate was being issued to the labourers before they catch the trains, she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mc-sets-up-call-centre-to-help-out-migrants-willing-to-go-back-home/story-uBhkosuZ6egw88YP6VLpQO.html

20-05-2020||Noida||Congress’ buses yet to reach Noida||After the Uttar Pradesh government accepted Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s offer of 1,000 buses to send migrant workers stranded in different border areas of the state, not one was seen at the stations in Greater Noida or Noida. The Congress said they were caught in paperwork, a handiwork by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the Centre and UP government.“At 11pm Monday, Uttar Pradesh officials wrote to us asking to send the buses to Lucknow complete with all papers like fitness certificate, pollution certificate, driving licence etc - by 10 am on Tuesday,” said Congress UP general secretary Virendra Singh Guddu. “And later, they asked us to send the buses to Noida’s Expo Mart in sector 62 instead, Ghaziabad’s Kaushambi and Sahibabad areas.” The party claims they had arranged 600 buses from Rajasthan and 400 from Delhi.“The ones from Rajasthan were on their way to Lucknow when they got orders to go to Noida’s sector 62. But at the Rajasthan-Agra border, they were stopped by the regional transport department despite having all required documents. The Delhi buses too were stopped at the Noida-Delhi despite having all documents. The BJP is playing cheap politics with poor migrants, who are forced to walk on roads in this scorching heat with their families and children. Our senior leaders are a protesting in Agra, and we are at the Noida-Delhi border with our buses. We will ensure buses reach Noida and Ghaziabad on Wednesday,” said Guddu.The Gautam Budh Nagar administration said that they expected these buses to arrive in the morning.“Our top officials in Lucknow informed us that these buses would arrive to pick up migrant labourers at the Expo Mart. When the did not arrive, we continued with our plan of using our designated buses to ferry migrant workers,” said Anil Kumar Singh, chief development officer, Gautam Budh Nagar, who is looking after the operation of sending migrants to hometowns. “Migrants can register via online helpline or at 180 and then we arrange adequate buses for them daily or trains.” He refused to comment on the Congress party allegations that their buses were stopped without valid reason.“Congress is playing politics with migrant workers’ suffering during this crisis which is very sad. Congress has sent buses which are not having required documents. It means they are not serious to help the migrants and needy. BJP and its workers are working day and night to help migrants and all who need it during this crisis,” said Dhirendra Singh BJP MLA from Jewar.Uttar Pradesh had sealed all its borders after 26 workers died in a road accident on Saturday. Migrant workers travelling in trucks and other vehicles and on foot would be asked to wait for buses or trains that the administration would arrange. It was then that Priyanka Gandhi, also party in-charge of UP (east) tweeted to the UP government with her request that was later accepted.On Tuesday, she tweeted: “UP government in its inquiry found that 879 out of 1049 buses have valid documents. Then they should allow these buses to operate. And our 500 buses are stopped are at border near Agra. And 300 buses are reaching Noida from Delhi. They should allow entry to buses having al documents. People are suffering we cannot wait.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/congress-buses-yet-to-reach-noida/story-PnLTx6iREksM8wNV7INShJ.html
20-05-2020||City||Councillor writes to Ludhiana MC chief, seeks report on CLU, EDC charges levied in 2019-20||In a letter to municipal corporation (MC) commissioner Kanwalpreet Kaur Brar, ward number 67 councillor Mamta Ashu has sought a report within two days from municipal town planner (MTP) Monica Anand on the collection of change of land use (CLU) and external development charges (EDC) against the building plans approved during the last fiscal. In January, the MC committee concerned had accused the building branch staff of levying different charges in every zone of the MC to favour builders and building owners. The committee had said MC officials had charged the rates approved by the state government in 2017 against many buildings, even though these rates were disapproved by the MC General House. Being a member of the MC committee, Mamta stated in the letter, “During the meeting of the committee held in January, committee members had sought a report from the MTP, but the report has still not been submitted. In that report, the MTP was also asked to list the orders of authorities concerned on the basis of which charges were collected from building owners.”“I have asked the MC chief to summon the report in two days and sought a meeting of the committee on May 26,” said Mamta. As per information, the state government had approved new CLU and EDC rates in 2017. But the MC House had rejected the same and officials were directed to continue charging the 2014 rates.The resolution rejecting the 2017 rates was then sent to the government that had directed MC to form a committee for finalising rates in December 2018.However, this information was allegedly concealed by the MC staff for allegedly benefitting builders and it is suspected the MC was levying both the rates (whichever is less) for favouring building owners.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mamta-writes-to-mc-chief-seeks-report-on-clu-edc-charges-levied-in-2019-20/story-Q6zxpvVzFxCYQ46LQ7T6vK.html
20-05-2020||Chandigarh||Private schools can now collect fees in Chandigarh||Days after the meeting with the Independent Schools Association (ISA), the Chandigarh education department, on Tuesday, gave the go-ahead to private schools in the city to collect monthly fees from parents.The Chandigarh education department’s permission for fee collection comes despite the fact that more than 60 Chandigarh schools have not uploaded the mandatory balance sheets online. Prior to this, the education department had directed all recognised private unaided schools to reschedule the last date for depositing fees and funds for the 2020-21 session. They were asked to fix the last date at least a month in advance after reopening of school, so as not to inconvenience parents. They were also told they could not charge for late fees.However, it came to notice that despite the directive, many schools demanded fees from parents. Following this, the education department invoked the Punjab Fees Regulation Act, 2016, and ordered schools to upload their balance sheets online.Furthermore, ISA and seven other petitioners (schools) challenged the UT’s directive on fee deferment in the Punjab and Haryana High Court. In compliance with orders of the HC, a hearing was granted by education secretary Arun Kumar Gupta to private schools, following which Tuesday’s orders were issued.The orders make it binding on schools, that they will “neither stop payment of monthly salary nor reduce the existing total emolument of teaching and non-teaching staff.”It also says that, if any parent is unable to deposit the fee on time, the school concerned will consider their request on a case to case basis. “However, neither the name of any student is to be struck off, nor is the student to be deprived of online teaching on this account, during lockdown period,” reads the order.HS Mamik, chairman of ISA, said, “Already, payment of fees for two months is pending, which parents need to pay, after which we will begin charging monthly fees.”President Chandigarh Parents’ Association Nitin Goyal said, “Schools are now demanding full hiked fees from parents who have suffered massive financial losses. Not only has the administration not taken any action against defaulting schools for not uploading their balance sheets, but have even provided them extensions and leverages.”“Where is the respite to the middle class in today’s order? We have again ended up as victims,” he said.Commenting on non-compliance of the balance sheet order by schools, Rubinderjit Singh Brar, director of school education, said, “We will issue show cause notices next week because it involves many schools and we have to recheck details of each school.”BOX1. Only monthly tuition fees can be collected by 15th day of every month from June 2020 onward2. The fees for April and May is to be collected by May 31, 20203. No late fee is to be charged up to May 31, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/private-schools-can-now-collect-fees-in-chandigarh/story-yVUzbFNzJSA2ArpHJGXesK.html
20-05-2020||City||Parents protest against school asking for tuition, admission fee in Ludhiana||Flouting social distancing norms, over 100 parents held a protest outside Merry Mint Public High School, Amar Nagar, on Tuesday, alleging that the school authorities had been them asking to pay the tuition and admission fee for April and May.They wrote a letter to Punjab education minister Vijay Inder Singla, urging him to waive the fee for the two months. The parents also claimed that the school was charging thrice the amount for books, compared to the market rates.Gurpal Nagar resident, Rajni Khurana, whose son and daughter are enrolled in Classes 1 and 2, said, “We are asking the authorities not to charge the fee as the schools have been closed due to Covid-19. Since all the assignments are being sent online, what is the need to purchase books at this time of financial crisis? Moreover, they are charging three times the market price.” Another parent, Kulvinder Kaur, who has three children studying in Classes 4, 8 and 10, said, “The school administration is neither reducing the fee nor waiving it. They should at least consider reducing the tuition fee to half. When we met the principal, she offered to reduce it by ₹200 per month, which is not enough. Schools should not be charging for the services they have not provided for the last two months.” Principal Harpreet Kaur could not be reached for comments despite repeated attempts.LIP, STUDENTS PROTEST AGAINST PRIVATE SCHOOLSSlamming the state government for its failure to act against schools asking parents to submit the fee along with transportation charges for April, May and June; members of Lok Insaaf Party (LIP) and a few students of different schools staged a protest outside the deputy commissioner’s (DC) office on Tuesday. The students were holding placards, urging the state government to announce school fee waiver rather than announcing free smartphones for them. They claimed schools were warning them of their names being struck off the school rolls if the fee was not paidLIP chief spokesperson Gagandeep Singh Kainth said, “The state government has failed to pay heed to the problems being faced by parents. Families are facing trouble catering to their daily needs and the schools are demanding fee for three months. How can parents pay such lumpsum amounts at this time of crisis?” “The government should announce that no school should charge fee in the lockdown period,” he added. The protesters submitted a memorandum regarding their demands to the additional deputy commissioner (ADC) Iqbal Singh Sandhu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/parents-protest-against-school-asking-for-tuition-admission-fee-in-ludhiana/story-USWNj0RfvoegSIhfUuFRwI.html
20-05-2020||Chandigarh||Unappetising start to delivery of cooked food, sales dismal in Chandigarh||When UT administration, on Monday, permitted the home delivery of cooked food, it was anticipated to be a moment of cheer for restaurateurs, dhaba owners as well as those who have been craving their pizzas, burgers and kebabs. However, sales on Tuesday were paltry.Barely a few riders of app-based food delivery companies were spotted on roads on Tuesday. Prem Sagar, a delivery boy with Zomato, said many restaurants had still not opened as they were preparing their food. Another delivery boy with Swiggy, Ankush Kumar said, that like the previous days, they mostly delivered groceries.Outlets of food chains such as KFC and Domino’s were closed to entry. Ashish, the manager of KFC’s Sector-35 outlet said only three orders had been delivered by late noon. A Domino’s employee, of condition of anonymity, also said their sales were meagre compared to an average day before the lockdown.With business having gone bust for about two months now, several dine-in restaurants have adapted to provide home delivery. Indian Coffee House in Sector 17 was open to orders which were being delivered within the sector, mostly to offices, said assistant manager Virender Singh. Nik Bakers which did not deliver earlier, has begun home delivery for their cooked items.Meanwhile, some eateries preferred to stay closed, as food without the particular ambiance does not ‘feel’ the same they said. Proprietor of Oven Fresh Rohit Kumar said, “Oven Fresh has never delivered food before, and we are still hesitant. We will first renovate, then after a survey of the response, we will decide if we should start delivering.”Most people who order food regularly are still apprehensive. Sector 9 resident Anmol Gupta said, “It is hard to monitor what is going on in a restaurant so currently I feel uneasy about ordering food.” Himali Bhargav, who lives in Sector 27, said, “I feel uneasy about eating food not cooked before me especially in these times.”Sector 18 resident Gagandeep Seikhon said she is not likely to order for a month. “This phase is as the curfew is lifted is crucial, as there will be more infections. I won’t order till cases come down.”Takeaways are hardly going to help restaurants which have suffered huge losses, said Arvinder Pal Singh, president of Chandigarh Restaurants and Hotels Association. “Tuesday sales were not even 10% of an average day. The government should allow restaurants to open soon, with all safety procedures in place.”Hot Millions proprietor Amanbir Singh said the administration has capped the timings for delivery too early in the evening. “Sales will stabilise eventually, but with the 7pm cap, we can’t provide dinner, which is our biggest source of earning. There is no point allowing deliveries from 7am as hardly anyone orders breakfast.”Pal Dhaba in Sector 28, received only 10-12 orders on Tuesday. Owner Sunny Pal said they used to get a 100 orders a day. “Maybe because many people don’t eat non-vegetarian fare on Tuesdays. I think orders will go up on Wednesday as people get to know that deliveries have started,” Sunny Pal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/unappetising-start-to-delivery-of-cooked-food-sales-dismal-in-chandigarh/story-k4fQaupaXFGmeaVI3oBTMJ.html

The mayor said the payment will be made only after the company repaired all the faulty lights.Company officials met the mayor at the Zone A office of the MC on Tuesday for getting the payment released. However, the mayor asked the officials to wait till an inspection was conducted to ensure that all the streetlights were functional.Sandhu said, “I had conducted an inspection on May 5 following complaints by residents and councillors that lights were lying non-functional in over 50% of the city area. During inspection, I found that the streetlights were non-functional even outside my camp office and MC commissioner Kanwalpreet Kaur Brar’s residence. Hence, I had directed the company to repair the lights by May 15. But, they failed to do so. So, we have stopped the payment. The payment will be released only after a fresh inspection.”Senior deputy mayor Sham Sundar Malhotra said, “The MC is supposed to make the payment to the company out of energy savings after the installation of LED lights in place of traditional ones. The proportion of energy-saving sharing (monetary value of savings) between the company and the MC is 85:15 (85% will go to the company and 15 to the MC). On this basis, if the lights remain non-functional, the savings will automatically increase and the company will get its benefit, while residents have to bear the brunt of non-functional streetlights.”A company official, requesting anonymity, said, “Most of the time, lights are damaged due to power theft as it leads to overloading. The MC has also not paid the required amount for updating the infrastructure. Only around ₹12 crore has been sanctioned against the over ₹50-crore demand. The recent delay in repairing the lights was due to the shortage of staff and material due to lockdown. However, lights are now functional in most parts of the city.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dysfunctional-streetlights-mayor-stops-payment-of-3-crore-to-company/story-6j99zvBFybo3x5I6rpUKvJ.html
20-05-2020||Delhi||All liquor shops, except those in malls, airport to reopen: Delhi govt||The Delhi government Tuesday allowed the opening of all liquor shops, except for those that are located in shopping malls and the airport. This came a day after the Delhi government scaled down restrictions in the fourth phase of the nationwide lockdown that kicked in on May 18 and will continue till May 31.The shops shall remain open from 9.30am to 6.30pm, read the order.There are 864 liquor shops in Delhi, of which around 600 will reopen now. This is apart from the 100 that had opened for business on May 4. The rest are located in containment zones, which include the airport and shopping malls, and cannot reopen under the guidelines issued by the Union home ministry, a senior official in the excise department said.The 850-odd restaurants in the city, which have a bar, have also not been allowed to sell liquor yet, though, under the new guidelines, their kitchen is now open for takeaway and the home delivery of food, the official said.Of the 700 liquor shops that can reopen, around 400 are under government departments, such as tourism and industrial and infrastructure development while the remaining 300 are private enterprises.“With the reopening of private vends, people will once again be able to avail of a much wider variety of Indian-manufactured foreign liquor, beer, wine, as well as imported liquor, after around two months of dry days,” a government official said.While the government-run shops can start functioning from Wednesday after thorough sanitisation, the private ones have been given time till Friday to complete stock management formalities, sanitisation, arranging staff and social distancing measures, excise officials said.The private enterprises that can operate now also include general stores and department stores that have alcohol counters. But they will have to adhere to the timings and the odd-even rule for shops in case they are located in markets or commercial spaces, the senior excise official said.Of the 700 liquor shops that can reopen, around 200 are stand-alone shops (those not located in market clusters), which can open all days of the week. The remaining 500 are located in markets and, hence, they will have to follow the odd-even rule, which allows shops allocated odd and even numbers to open on alternate dates.In the last two weeks, there have been massive crowds and rampant violation of social distancing norms around the 100 or so liquor shops in Delhi that were open for business, often leading the police and district administration to crack down.Vinod Giri, director-general of the Confederation of Indian Alcoholic Beverage Companies, welcomed the move calling it a “win-win situation” for stakeholders. He said, “It will help stabilise the industry. It will help the government earn revenue. It will help customers buy liquor of their choice, which several of them have not been able to do in the past several days either due to the massive rush or inadequate stocks. Having more shops open would also help ensure better social distancing.”The e-coupon system that was introduced by the Delhi government last week would continue. Under this system, individuals can apply online and avail of time slots to visit a designated liquor shop and purchase liquor without having to join a queue.The government, however, has done away with the proposal of the home delivery of liquor, for now, a senior government official said.Also, the “special corona fee” of 70% on the MRP of liquor would continue to apply.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/all-liquor-shops-except-those-in-malls-airport-to-reopen-delhi-govt/story-8nwyktcXxwmUpnZRrpAw5J.html
20-05-2020||Delhi||Bootleggers use the aged, the disabled to evade cops||With 90% of all liquor vends across Delhi closed since March 25, bootleggers have been coming up with innovative ways to smuggle the spirits into the capital city.Although all shops were shut since March 25, on May 4, the government had allowed 100 of the 864 liquor stores in Delhi to reopen. But they were in no way able to manage the huge crowds that descended on them in blatant violation of all social distancing norms. Experts say the huge profit margins and the wide demand-supply gap has bootleggers moving in to fill the void. From hiring the elderly or disabled people as carriers to transporting liquor hidden in vegetable carts, the bootleggers over the last two months used every trick in their book to milk the dry days while avoiding arrest. The Narela police on April 26 arrested a 75-year-old woman for smuggling liquor from Sonepat, Haryana. The woman told police she was paid ₹2,000 to sit as a pillion rider on a scooter to avoid suspicion. While the young man, who hired her, abandoned the scooter on seeing the police and fled, the elderly woman could not run and was caught. Police found at least 100 bottles of liquor with her, each containing about 330ml. Hoping that police would not stop disabled persons for checking, a bootlegger roped in a physically disabled person. When police stopped the two at Nangloi on April 28, they found 90 bottles of liquor, each bottle measuring 180ml, smuggled from Bahadurgarh, Haryana. The 40-year-old disabled person told police that a friend had promised him ₹500 for each trip he made. Last month, police registered at least 300 cases under the Excise Act and also seized around 30,000 bottles of liquor. Delhi Police officers said with the government opening all shops, except those in malls and containment zones, there will be a reduction in bootlegging. In the last one month, police found bootleggers smuggling liquor in vehicles carrying loads of cauliflower, cucumber an other vegetables. On May 2, when police stopped an e-rickshaw loaded with cucumbers, the driver’s behaviour aroused suspicion, prompting the police to carefully sift through the cucumbers. They found 580 bottles hidden inside the cucumbers. In Chhawla, two men were arrested for using a private ambulance to smuggle 913 liquor bottles. Deputy commissioner of police(Dwarka) Anto Alphonso, said the two were paid ₹2,000 each by the owner of the ambulance vehicle to ferry the contraband.It isn’t just vehicles or unusual carriers. Until last week, when movement of all persons except those involved in essential services, restricted across the city, a 36-year-old man came up with the idea of getting alcohol to his buyers in south Delhi while posing as a Good Samaritan out to distribute food to the underprivileged. He was arrested from Jaitpur on May 10.Retired IPS officer Vikram Singh, who was the director general of Uttar Pradesh Police, said when there is a prohibition, criminals do come up with innovative ways to beat it. “Liquor was unavailable until recently. The profit margins for a smuggled bottle is very high so they find innovative means to smuggle them,” he said.Delhi Police spokesperson Mandeep Randhawa said even so, police are one step ahead of them. “Our personnel on the ground are alert and keep an eye on every vehicle passing through the border. Apart from acting on tipoffs we also conduct random checks on suspicious vehicles. We rely on intelligence from our sources to catch these smugglers. Bootleggers may come up with innovative ways but we are ahead of them. This is the reason why we have busted illicit liquor transported in ambulances, vegetable carts, milk canisters.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/bootleggers-use-the-aged-the-disabled-to-evade-cops/story-s5JUWrYz9xNmSxNAPyD5DJ.html
20-05-2020||Delhi||Delhi’s transport network sputters back to life after reopening hiccups||After nearly two months of being off the roads, Delhi’s public transport system sputtered back to life Tuesday. The empty roads got busier as the day progressed though many complained of long waits for buses and autos fleecing them. On Tuesday, the first day after the state government relaxed lockdown norms (following the Centre doing so on Sunday evening), fewer cabs were on the roads, most bus stops didn’t have the promised marshals , and not everyone who wanted to travel by bus was screened with an infrared thermometer. According to reports from the Delhi government, the state transport utilities pressed more than 2,000 Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) buses and cluster buses into service on Tuesday from its fleet of 6,487 buses.Transport minister Kailash Gahlot said the number of buses was low because around 1,400 buses are at the disposal of revenue and police departments for movement of migrants to railway stations and for law and order duties.“We are also facing an issue with the availability of bus drivers due to the curbs in neighbouring states. We hope to have more buses on the road in the coming days,” he said. Even as transport officials said the number of passengers who travelled in the state-run buses on Tuesday was only about 10% of the usual daily bus ridership of 3.2 million, commuters demanded more buses and an increase in frequency of trips. Many even questioned the government’s move to open all offices, industries and allow construction and other economic activities to resume citing that the public transport system was “grossly inadequate” to handle the load, which is going to increase with each passing day. The Metro service is still not allowed in the national capital. Only 1,650 marshals were deployed at bus stops on Tuesday, with the result that people queueing up at bus stops were seen voluntarily following the social distancing protocol. On Monday, the Delhi government had said it would deploy 4,000 marshals at 740 busy bus queue shelters to ensure social distancing.After visiting several bus stops and terminals in Delhi, HT found that the fewer number of buses, coupled with the rule that allowing only 20 passengers per bus, resulted in longer waiting periods for people at bus stops.Subhash Chand (62) waited for more than two hours at the Shivaji Park bus stand to board a bus to his home in Dwarka. He had an eye treatment at the Guru Nanak Eye Centre at Maharaja Ranjeet Singh Marg, after which around 1pm, he walked for about 35 minutes to reach the terminal.“There was no auto or e-rickshaw available to drop me at the bus terminal. It is so hot, and even at the terminal there was no respite. I have been waiting for two hours for the bus. In the morning, I reached the bus stop in Dwarka at 8am and was able to hop on one after an hour,” Chand said. On buses, stickers saying ‘do not sit’ have been pasted on every alternate seat. Tinku Mondal, who had arrived by a special passenger train from Howrah, West Bengal, said he waited for two hours before he could board a bus from Kapashera bus depot to go to the Delhi-Gurugram border. “I travelled from Sultanpuri to Punjabi Bagh by bus, then took an auto to AIIMS. At AIIMS, I waited for 1.5 hours for bus number 433 to Okhla to join work at my factory,” he said.  The bus queue shelters at Apollo Hospital, Okhla Tank, Ras Vihar, Sarita Vihar, Harkesh Nagar and Saraswati Kunj had marshals managing the people. Thermal screening of passengers was absent at a majority of the bus shelters across the city.“Today we have initiated the process to procure 1,000 contactless temperature checking devices. We did start thermal screening at a few select bus stops on Tuesday. But, the problem is that we have only a few devices at our disposal,” Gahlot said. Those who opted to travel by auto-rickshaws said they were overcharged by drivers or had to hire multiple autos to adhere to the Delhi government’s norm of one passenger per auto. Some autos, however, were seen carrying two passengers as well. Rajesh Gupta, a retired government employee, who had to go to Okhla from AIIMS, said the auto driver asked him for ₹350 for the ride. “It ride usually costs me about ₹150. I asked him to settle for ₹200-250, but he refused. So I had to wait for a bus for more than an hour to get home,” Gupta said. Cabs also resumed services on Tuesday, but very few were spotted on the roads. An official of cab aggregator service provider Ola, who did not want to be identified, said the number of bookings received from Delhi was lower when compared to the bookings they received before the outbreak of the pandemic. “I tried booking a cab and the app gave me a waiting time of around 15 minutes. But due to dynamic pricing mechanism, I had to pay about ₹40 more for my ride to Laxmi Nagar from South Extension,” Ruchira Tyagi, an employee at a designer apparel store in South Extension Part 2, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-s-transport-network-sputters-back-to-life/story-AHLcer8rCd8u28RAt3RHxJ.html
20-05-2020||Delhi||North corporation gets Rs 1.3 crore from IGL to repair cremation furnaces at Nigambodh Ghat||The North Delhi Municipal Corporation has received a fund of Rs 1.3 crore from Indraprastha Gas Limited (IGL) to repair its damaged CNG-based cremation furnaces at Nigambodh Ghat.The Delhi government has authorised only three crematoriums in the Capital to dispose of dead bodies of Covid-19 patients or those who had symptoms of the infection.Two of these are CNG-based: Nigambodh Ghat in Jamuna Bazaar, under the north corporation, and one in Punjabi Bagh, under the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC). The third is the electric crematorium on Lodhi Road under the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC).Besides these, five burial grounds for Muslim and Christian people, who die of Covid, have been approved at ITO, Mangolpuri, Madanpur Khadar and Shastri Park.While each CNG furnace is capable of processing only four bodies per day, they have been receiving up to 18 bodies for cremation as per Covid protocol daily. The Covid dead body disposal Standard Operating Procedures are followed for those who have died of the disease and suspected cases as well. “We are under a lot of pressure. We have six CNG-furnaces in Nigambodh Ghat, of which three were damaged and the rest functional. Till April, we were getting only four or five bodies for cremation with Covid protocol. The number has now gone up,” said Suman Gupta of the Nigambodh Ghat Sanchalan Samiti.For instance, on May 12, the crematorium got 16 such bodies, and on May 13 and 14, they got 18 bodies each, Gupta said. From May 15-17, it has been getting 13 bodies each day, he said.“This is why getting the other three dysfunctional furnaces running was important for us. Thankfully, we got Rs 1.3 crore from IGL,” said Vishal Mishra, another member of the Samiti. “We placed the work order on April 15 and started work on the furnaces today,” Dr. Ashok Rawat, municipal health officer of the north body said.An IGL spokesperson, who didn’t wish to be named, said, “We have provided about Rs 1.3 crore under Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and glad to have done our bit for the society in times of such a pandemic.” The Punjabi Bagh cremation facility has four CNG-operated furnaces out of which two were defunct till a few days ago. The load of cremating bodies was being shouldered by two furnaces, resulting in delays in cremation.“The two machines, which were under maintenance, have been repaired now, so all four furnaces are working. Now there is no pendency of bodies at the facility,” a senior SDMC official said.The official said in the last three days, 40 bodies of confirmed Covid and suspected patients were cremated here. According to central government guidelines, bodies of Covid-19 patients can be carried cremated at CNG furnaces only as it ensures “closed and complete burning.”Wood-based burning releases particulate matter in the air and is not recommended for patients with infectious diseases such as Covid or even tuberculosis. “As many as 13 bodies were received at the Punjabi Bagh facility on May 16. While 16 were cremated on May 17, 11 were received for funeral on May 18. The cremation was done without any delay,” the SDMC official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/north-corporation-gets-rs-1-3-crore-from-igl-to-repair-cremation-furnaces-at-nigambodh-ghat/story-M5bzd0iZ4VbCYt7H0Aud6O.html
20-05-2020||City||160 high-risk inmates to be shifted from Mandoli jail to Tihar||A high-powered committee, constituted to decongest prisons in the national capital, has resolved that all 160 high-risk prisoners lodged in jail number 15 in Mandoli prison, be shifted to the Tihar jail complex, to allow new entrants to the former to be lodged in separate cells in isolation. The move comes after 15 prisoners and one jail staffer in the Rohini prison complex tested positive for Covid-19 last week.In a meeting on May 18, Sandeep Goel, director general (prisons), told the committee precautions are being taken and all contacts of the infected persons are being traced.Justice Hima Kohli, chairman of the committee, had asked the DG (prisons) whether individual cells, which could be converted into isolation cells, were available in any prison, to allow new entrants at least 14 days of isolation, so as to keep others at bay from the potential threat of contracting Covid-19.Goel said jail 15 at Mandoli prison, which has an overall capacity of 280 prisoners, has 248 individual cells (with attached toilets). He also told the committee that Mandoli currently has 178 inmates, of whom 139 are under trial, 38 are convicts, and one is a detenue.“After transferring the existing inmates of Jail No 15, the same shall be available for keeping the new entrants in isolation cells/rooms. This shall take care of all the new male entrants who are above 21 years of age. It is made clear that fresh male inmates who are between 18 to 21 years of age and fresh women inmates shall continue to be kept in ‘ separate isolation wards at jail no 5 and 6 respectively at Tihar, in terms of the earlier resolution.“It is resolved that these new inmates shall be permitted to intermingle with other inmates only after keeping them in Isolation Wards for 14 days and before lodging them, they should be thermally screened and medically examined and in case of any medical necessity, their RT-PCR test be conducted,” the minutes of the meeting read.Goel also told the committee that steps are being taken to maintain social distancing and regular medical checkup of jail staff and inmates is being done through jail doctors who have been advised to inform jail superintendents if they find symptoms of Covid-19 in any inmate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/160-high-risk-inmates-to-be-shifted-from-mandoli-jail-to-tihar/story-MdLWVPAaSjnnM31aZVr4QJ.html
20-05-2020||Delhi||As Delhi returns to work, RWAs set guidelines for domestic help||While several residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) in the city have allowed domestic help to return to work, there are some which have or are in the process of putting in place rules for their movement within colonies. The Delhi government, in its order on Tuesday, had clearly stated that RWAs can’t ‘prevent persons from performing their services’.In some residential areas, RWAs have asked domestic help to show their Aadhaar Card to ascertain whether they are coming from containment zones and have requested an undertaking from residents as well. Some RWAs are also contemplating fixing timings for the entry of domestic help.In Vasant Kunj’s Sector A Pocket C, the RWA has allowed domestic help, but with a rider. “We have asked residents to place a request with the RWA to allow domestic help. We are not stopping anyone; we just want to know who is entering our society,” Vinay Kumar Gupta, the RWA president, said.In Alaknanda, which has over 10 residential apartment societies, most residents have decided to wait for some time before allowing domestic help to start work again. But some rules have been put in place for those who want to call domestic help at home.“For the elderly, working couples and whoever wants to call domestic help, different societies have put in place some basic rules. We are asking the help to show their Aadhaar cards at the gate so that we can ensure that they are not coming from containment zones. Some societies are issuing new ID cards while others are fixing timings for their entry. We are not stopping anyone, but we are taking these measures for everyone’s safety,” Poonam Arora, general secretary of the Federation of Alaknanda RWAs, said.The joint forum of 45 residential apartments in east Delhi’s Vasundhara Enclave issued a set of guidelines on Monday, allowing domestic help between 7 am and 11am only for those in “dire need”, such as elderly people and working couples.“Residents in their own safety interest might like to ensure that their domestic help works exclusively in their house [sic],” the guidelines stated.Shantanu Monga, who works in an IT firm and lives in Vasundhara Enclave, said, “Now, it’s become very difficult for us to manage on our own since we have to report back to work. Despite the government allowing domestic help, how can residential societies bar them? This is absolutely unacceptable.”But JP Sharma, the president of the forum, said, “ We have asked all apartment buildings not to stop residents from calling domestic help. We just want them to ensure they wear masks all the time, don’t roam around the premises after work and in no circumstances be allowed to visit in the evening,” he said.In Indraprastha Extension, Dwarka and Patparganj—these areas have a large number of apartment complexes—RWAs have allowed domestic help to resume work. “We have to live with Covid-19. We have just advised RWAs to ensure that the domestic help follow all hygiene measures and cover their faces,” Rejimon CK, a member of Dwarka Forum, said.While RWAs are doing their bit to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in localities, they said that the Delhi government should have roped them in for the effective implementations of its new norms. “Strangely, a bus driver/conductor, an auto driver, a shop keeper can be entrusted with this responsibility, but a duly elected body representing a residential area is looked at with doubt. It is high time that the government appreciates the role of the RWAs in propagating their point of view among the residents of the colonies,” Atul Goyal, president of URJA, a network of RWAs in Delhi, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/rwas-set-rules-for-domestic-help/story-kJZfeBofu4oi0df0enLxQN.html
20-05-2020||Delhi||Arvind Kejriwal asks Centre for 100 special trains to send migrant workers back||Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has urged the central government to provide 100 shramik special trains to the Delhi government for sending back thousands of stranded migrant workers to their home states, senior officials in the chief minister’s office said on Tuesday.The chief minister’s demand came amid the ongoing blame game on the matter between the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said, “Till now, around 65,000 migrants from Delhi have been sent to their home states by trains. We are seeking permission from different states to send back their citizens stranded in Delhi.”However, the consent of destination states is not required for running Shramik special trains to ferry migrant workers, the ministry of railways said Tuesday, revising an earlier order that made it mandatory for both states to mutually agree to run the trains.Senior officials in the chief minister’s office said the government had received online applications from around 400,000 migrant workers in the city wanting to go back home. The highest number of them belong to Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.They said that so far, 59 special trains and over 200 buses had left Delhi in the past one week. The states and union territories covered include Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Rajasthan and Assam.“The government now plans to scale up the process and schedule trains on an hourly basis one after another if more trains are granted at the earliest. We are talking to more states,” an official said.AAP spokesperson and Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh criticised the BJP-ruled Central government for its “deliberate reluctance” to send the poor back to their homes.“To send these four lakh migrants, we need 350 trains, but the BJP government is running 100 trains across the country, which shows their apathy towards solving this issue. The BJP sent luxury flights for those stuck in other countries, but they do not care for the poor people who are walking hundreds and thousands of kilometres barefoot. This shows the BJP is an anti-poor political party,” Singh said. The Delhi BJP, on the other hand, said the AAP government was responsible for the exodus of migrant workers from the Capital. Leader of opposition in the Delhi Assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri said the Central government had given 8kg wheat, 2kg rice and one kg pulses free to 72 lakh people of Delhi, but the AAP government failed to distribute the ration to all of the poor people.“Only ₹6.5 crore was spent by the Delhi government on ration distribution. Union food minister Ram Vilas Paswan has already said only 1% of the ration issued by the Centre for the month of April was given by the Delhi government to the poor people. The central government has been providing free ration to 72 lakh people of Delhi for three months,” he said. “The BJP’s allegation is completely baseless. The Delhi government had first announced increasing the ration quota of card holders in March, whereas the Centre announced its scheme in April. By then, we had already completed one round of extra and free ration distribution in the Capital. Delhi government had announced its ration scheme even before the Centre, or any other state for that matter. BJP is doing politics over the migrant crisis instead of actually solving it,” said a media advisor to the chief minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kejriwal-asks-centre-for-100-special-trains-to-send-migrant-workers-back/story-2ksWHvUpsng3YWVsZ4YfzK.html
20-05-2020||Noida||Traffic jams on Delhi-Noida border as GB Nagar admin continues with travel restrictions||With the district administration of Gautam Budh Nagar maintaining the status quo on travel restrictions between Delhi and Noida, commuters faced traffic snarls during peak hours even on the second day of Lockdown 4.0.The ministry of home affairs(MHA), last week, had removed all restrictions on interstate travel if the states consent. Guidelines of the Uttar Pradesh government have also allowed travel between Delhi and Gautam Budh Nagar, leaving the final decision with the respective district administrations. The Gautam Budh Nagar district administration, however, chose to continue with the travel restrictions in place. Border areas like Kalindi Kunj barrage and the Delhi-Noida-Direct (DND) Flyway saw heavy traffic congestion on both Monday as well as Tuesday with more load being seen on the Delhi-Noida side of the carriageway.“The guidelines clearly state that the individual district magistrate will make the final decision and in our district the restrictions are yet to be lifted. For some reason, people feel that they can cross borders without any reason and vehicles are being returned every day except for emergency vehicles, those belonging to essential services and those with valid administrative passes,” said Rajesh S, deputy commissioner of police, traffic.Officials have had to open multiple lanes to manage the traffic congestion and the situation was brought under control by afternoon.In a combined tweet by the Noida district magistrate and the commissioner of Noida police, the officials said that the status quo shall be maintained between Delhi-Noida border for now while further instructions are being sought from the state government regarding this.Meanwhile, commuters faced long hours of traffic congestion because many vehicles were being denied entry while cops carried out a thorough ID search.“Around 9 am today (Tuesday), there was a lot of traffic on the Kalindi Kunj stretch on the Noida side. Police personnel are not just looking at passes. Each and every document is also being thoroughly scrutinised while those people who don’t have the valid authentication are being asked to go back,” said Vikas Chauhan, an executive with a medical equipment manufacturing firm in Noida.In the evening, there was severe traffic congestion on both the DND flyway and Kalindi Kunj barrage towards the Noida side. The jam stretched for kilometres, and, as the situation worsened, Noida Police had to let the public in without any checks.“All commuters have been warned to avoid this. If they leave in the morning for Delhi, then traffic becomes a problem in the evening creating a lot of chaos. So until the state government issues any fresh guidelines, only people with valid passes and those belonging to essential services should be allowed to travel across the border,” said Kumar Ranvijay Singh, additional deputy commissioner of police.“I came to Noida in the morning around 6am for work. We have necessary passes but everything is being checked thoroughly. There isn’t too much traffic in the morning hours. However, while going back in the afternoon, the traffic had started slowing across the Kalindi Kunj barrage towards the Noida side with people returning,” said Sanjay Joshi, another commuter.According to the Noida Police, the officials of Delhi Police have also been briefed about the problem.“No matter what, anyone coming in to Noida without a valid pass or not belonging to any of the listed essential services will not be allowed to enter. In fact, they can be issued a challan under Section 188 for breaking the guidelines of the lockdown,” said Sankalp Sharma, deputy commissioner of police, Zone-1.Officials said that despite the guidelines remaining unchanged for the past few weeks, the public is still trying to cross the state borders without any reason, which is leading to traffic congestion. Fresh guidelines are expected from the district administration soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/traffic-jams-on-delhi-noida-border-as-gb-nagar-admin-continues-with-travel-restrictions/story-S7FSp1cyqLLGtQzB4oOCCJ.html

20-05-2020||City||Key accused in Ludhiana 30kg gold heist sent to five-day police custody||Another accused in the 30kg gold heist case, Chandan, alias Chandu, who was lodged in the Nabha jail and was the brain behind the heist, was brought on production warrants by a team of the Organised Crime Control Unit (OCCU) of the Punjab Police from the New Nabha Jail and produced in a Ludhiana court on Tuesday. The court remanded him in five-day police custody.According to the police, the accused, who is a resident of Ferozepur and a close associate of gangster Jaipal Singh Bhullar, had operated from the jail and arranged everything for executing the robbery.Chandan is facing trial in 30 cases, including murders and attempts to murder. In 2016, the army’s Military Intelligence (MI) had written to the Punjab Police that criminals in state jails, including Chandan, were running extortion rackets. Inspector general of police (OCCU) Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh said gangster Chandan had hatched a conspiracy to commit the gold heist in the IIFL branch, Gill Road. He had prepared the escape plan for the accused and also arranged shelter for them in Ferozepur through his contacts. He was also supposed to get the lion’s share in the robbery.Gangsters Jaipal Bhullar and Gursewak Singh are yet to be arrested in the case.On February 17, five armed robbers had robbed gold ornaments and Rs 3 lakh in cash from the IIFL gold loan branch on the Gill Road. The robbers executed the crime within 25 minutes after the financial service company’s branch, located opposite the Punjab Police’s Crime Investigation Agency Unit 3 office, had opened.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/key-accused-in-30kg-gold-heist-sent-to-five-day-police-custody/story-oWxesAjOgJvv3RSQwgkOqJ.html
20-05-2020||Noida||Interstate travel restricted, standalone shops, markets to open in Noida||Although restrictive norms have been eased across states, under the fourth phase of the lockdown that kicked in on May 18, the Gautam Budh Nagar district administration still continues to enforce the rules strictly with few relaxations. On Tuesday evening, the Uttar Pradesh government flagged the district administration’s decision to maintain status quo on the movement of vehicles between Noida and Delhi, with reference to point 3 (1) and 7 (12) of the government order of the state home department issued on May 18.GB Nagar commissioner of police (CP) Alok Singh said that point 7 (12) categorically said that no one will be allowed to enter GB Nagar, who are coming from the hot spot areas of Delhi and Ghaziabad. “Since it was really difficult to identify them, the district and police administration had no option other than to maintain the status quo as a precautionary measure, to check the further spread of Covid-19 in the district,” he said.Referring to point 3(1) of the government order, Singh said movement of interstate buses will depend on the result of talks between the two state governments.The CP further said all kinds of industrial work have been allowed apart from those in the containment zones. “But, they will have to strictly follow the Covid-19 safety guidelines, which include social distancing, sanitization and mandatory face masks. All shopkeepers, who have been permitted to operate, will also follow the same rules. They have been asked not to entertain any customer who is not wearing a mask. Markets, too, have been allowed to open, but the shopkeepers there will also have to follow the safety measures,” he said.Singh further said that wedding venues have been allowed to open. “But, not more than 20 people will be allowed in any case at a wedding function. Even for that, the wedding hall owners will have to take prior permission of the administration for a booking,” he said.About the movement of vehicles, he said that vehicular movement will be allowed in the state. “While in a four-wheeler two people are allowed besides the driver, two-wheelers cannot have a pillion rider, except a female. In three-wheelers, apart from driver, two passengers will be allowed,” he said.The CP also said that main vegetable markets will be allowed to operate from 4am to 7am. “The timing for the retail vegetable mandis has been stipulated from 6am to 9am. However, the public are allowed to buy vegetables between 8am and 6pm,” he said.He further said restaurant owners have also been allowed to operate but only for takeaways and home delivery. “The sweets shops will also follow the same rule and they will have to ensure proper sanitization. These eateries are not permitted to serve eatables in-house. The dry cleaning shops and printing presses have also been allowed in non-containment zones,” he said. However, shopping malls will remain shut in Noida and Greater Noida until further orders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/interstate-travel-restricted-standalone-shops-markets-to-open-in-noida/story-obLmDRDFhZ4sh95z41oQwM.html

20-05-2020||Gurugram||2 constables of Gurugram Police test positive for Covid-19||Two police constables of Gurugram Police have tested positive for coronavirus disease (Covid-19), confirmed officials on Tuesday. The police officials are the first Covid-19 positive cases in the police force in the district. Police officials and health department officials confirmed that both the police constables had tested positive for Covid-19 earlier this week.The police said the constables, who are in their 20s, were asymptomatic in nature. They were posted at Bajghera and Sector 17/18 police stations respectively and were on Covid-19 duty in the city.Muhammad Akil, commissioner of police, Gurugram, said, “One of them was posted in Sector 18 and had come in close contact with a Covid-19 patient while discharging duties. The second was posted at Bajghera and came in close contact with another positive person, who was his brother’s friend. His brother, however, has tested negative,” he said.According to the police, both the officials have been placed under home quarantine. Police officials have also converted one barrack into a quarantine ward for police personnel.Akil said that the constable from Sector 17/18 police station, a native of Mahendargarh, was deployed in Sirhaul, which is a containment zone. The second positive case is that of a head constable from Bajghera police station, who hails from Rewari. “In the past week, their samples were taken and both were found to be positive. Both the police stations have been sanitised and samples of their colleagues and those who came in contact with them have been taken,” he said.Nearly 5,800 police personnel are deployed for Covid-19 duties in Gurugram, including being posted at the 11 borders with the neighbouring state. Gurugram has recorded a fewer number of cases among police personnel as compared to other districts.Dr Jaswant Singh Punia, chief medical officer (CMO), said that both the infected police personnel have been put under isolation and contact tracing is being carried out.Earlier, the asymptomatic patients were placed under isolation in the hospitals but after the revised guidelines by the ministry of home affairs (MHA), they are either isolated at home or shifted to Covid-19 care centres, said the police.The police said an assistant sub-inspector (ASI) from Sector 14 police station had tested positive last month but when he was tested for a second time, the reports were found to be negative. “The ASI had taken down the body of a man, who had allegedly committed suicide, after hanging himself with ceiling fan. He was wearing a PPE kit,” said Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime).FARIDABADFaridabad on Tuesday reported 13 new cases of Covid-19, including three police officials. The police said all the infected officials were admitted to a hospital and those who came in contact with them were placed under quarantine. The officials who tested positive include two special police officers (SPOs) from the Sector 55 police post and one police officer from Saran police station.These policemen had come in contact with a constable from Sector 17 police station, who was suspected to be positive. However, his report came out negative on Tuesday and he was discharged from the hospital. Saran police station and Sector 55 police post have been sanitised, said the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/2-constables-of-gurugram-police-test-positive-for-covid-19/story-MbwfwBLyIcO9NsP8bWLlnM.html
20-05-2020||Gurugram||Ease in lockdown poses challenge for the health department||At a time when coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases are rapidly increasing in the city, health officials worry that with the easing lockdown, exposure to the Sars-CoV-2 virus will increase if social distancing is not maintained. The opening of industries and more activity in high density areas pose a big challenge to contain the crisis even as they now look for setting up additional quarantine facilities.Announcing a third extension of the nation-wide lockdown to contain the virus till May 31, the central government on Sunday had allowed states to demarcate their areas of infection and relaxations. The Haryana government on Monday allowed industries, outside containment zones, to function with 100% staff.“The chances of exposure are high as there has been an ease in the lockdown,” said Dr Jaswant Singh Punia, chief medical officer, Gurugram. “Since industries and factories are reopening, they should approach us for the surveillance of their employees. We can screen them and based on the symptoms, we can timely isolate them. This would reduce the risk of transmission. In this way, industrial operations wouldn’t be halted and timely symptomatic cases can be traced.”Till Tuesday evening, Haryana recorded 36 fresh cases (Gurugram nine) taking the total to 964 (Gurugram 220). The total number of deaths due to the infection in the state is 14, while Gurugram suffered no deaths. In the last 20 days, the city has saw a surge with 150 cases.Most cases are asymptomatic, according to health officials. According to Punia, emerging new cases are the primary contacts of Covid-19 patients and nearly 80% of them are asymptomatic. But cases coming from crowded urban settlements pose serious issues.“We have reported cases where domestic helps, workers, security guards and drivers have contracted the virus. The target is to test them and quarantine the high risk contacts,” he said.BREAKING TRANSMISSION CHAINIn crowded areas like Sirhaul, Dundahera, Basai Enclave, breaking the chain of transmission is even more challenging where industrial workers and daily wage workers reside. Each of these areas has reported more than 10 cases in the last two weeks. Following the guidelines issued on May 16 by the union ministry of health and family welfare, high risk contacts found in congested areas have to be quarantined separately.As per the guideline, a quarantine facility has to be identified where large number of high risk contacts can be accommodated. Shifting of high risk contacts, like elderly and those with co-morbid conditions is a crucial intervention to minimize the spread of disease in such persons, thereby limiting morbidity and mortality among them. A contingency plan has to be in place to move high risk population to alternative or temporary sites.The health team wants to expand its existing capacity of 500-bed quarantine facility. Interestingly, the department has converted 400-bed quarantine facility in sector 9 as Covid Care Centre and is admitting asymptomatic Covid-19 patients. Dr Jai Prakash, nodal officer for the quarantine facility, said, “Males who are asymptomatic Covid-19 positive are kept in sector 9 quarantine facility, while women are kept in the isolation ward of sector 10 Civil Hospital. Symptomatic patients and high-risk area admitted in 100-bed ESIC Hospital, sector 9, 120-bed Medeor in Manesar and other private hospitals of the city.” Six private hospitals have kept 100-bed, each, for Covid-19 cases.High risk contacts of Covid-19 patients, who can easily spread the virus till their reports are declared, are being taken to 100-bed Bhora Kalan facility in Pataudi for quarantine, according to the nodal officer. There are at least 40 people under quarantine at the facility. Dr Punia, however, said, the administration along with health department has identified a few community centres to set up quarantine facility.In DLF- Phase 1, the proposal is to convert community centre into qurantine facility but residents has opposed the move as community centre is in the middle of the residential area. RS Rathee, independent elected councillor ward no 34 recently took to social media to raise the issue citing residents’ objection in setting up the facility.A member of rapid response privy to the matter said, “Quarantine has become an issue as people are not willing to stay away from their families for 14 days. Also, we are finding more places where the facility could be set. Everyone wants home like facility at the quarantine centre, which is not possible. Now, government has also issued guidelines for home isolation. It now depends how people manage social distancing on their own.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/ease-in-lockdown-poses-challenge-for-the-health-department/story-GEUsz3LEdNcCisN9MnWHWM.html

We suggested that the fixed charges should be waived for at least a year to bring relief to the industry, which is reeling under losses,” said Thukral.Hunjan and Kalsi said the industry was going through a tough time and the government should provide immediate and extensive relief to the industry as a major section, especially the micro and small industry, will not be able to survive without support.Thukral said they will take up the matter with the PSERC officials during the public hearing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-small-scale-industrialists-body-seeks-power-bill-waiver-for-a-year/story-ipi9KcuLIwDeyQpveGMs1I.html
20-05-2020||City||Kerala residents stranded in Ludhiana sent home on special train||Around 90 people from Kerala stranded in Ludhiana returned to Thiruvananthapuram on a Shramik Special train from the Jalandhar railway station on Tuesday night.The passengers included around 20 nursing students from Christian Medical College (CMC), Ludhiana, while others were employees of private companies and some labourers.They had applied to travel back home on the Punjab Helpline Portal, following which they were called to the Amar Shaheed Sukhdev Interstate Bus Terminal in Ludhiana for the Thiruvananthapuram from Jalandhar. Ludhiana district administration coordinated with the Jalandhar administration and sent these passengers there on three buses after their medical screening at the local ISBT.Varghese, a nursing student, said she had been staying at the CMC hostel during the lockdown. “I didn’t face any problem, but as the government was providing the facility for stranded people, I decided to go back home,” she said.Mohammad Fayaz had come to Ludhiana two months ago for work, but got stuck here after the curfew was clamped. “I got shelter at the mosque on Rahon Road where we were provided all facilities. I applied to return to Kerala after I got to know of the special trains,” he said.Another passenger, requesting anonymity, said his company had allowed him to work from home, but it was inconvenient to do so from the paying guest facility. “So, he chose to travel back home for now. I will return after the situation normalises,” he said.Assistant deputy commissioner Iqbal Singh Sandhu said three buses were sent to Jalandhar railway station carrying migrants from Kerala, while three buses carrying around 90 migrants were sent to various districts of Uttar Pradesh, including Aligarh, Meerut and Muzaffarpur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kerala-residents-stranded-in-ludhiana-sent-home-on-special-train/story-w5yHhjZzM0wwoWDdzGSn6H.html

We are also not expecting much footfall as it will take days for normalcy to return,” he said.He said their regular customers were migrants and rural people. “Most of such people are struggling due to depleting finances or have left for their home states. Also, lack of public transport has affected our sales.”Similarly, the shopkeepers of the Books Market said their counter sale had dropped by around 80%.JS Bunty, president of the Books Market Association and owner of Sant Stationery, said the retailers were expecting a number of customers as online classes for the new academic session had started. “But the footfall is too less.

20-05-2020||Pune||650 cases from 3 sq km area of Tadiwala, Mahatma Phule peth slum||The three-sq-km area that covers Tadiwala road and the Mahatma Phule peth slum have have reported at least 650 Covid-19-poisitve cases, which is 18 per cent of the total cases (3,598 as of May 18), in a city with a population of 40 lakh, spread over 331 square kilometres.These two areas from Dhole Patil road and Bhavani peth wards of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) were among the first to be declared red zones as social distancing is a challenge due to the cramped living conditions.According to DP road ward officer Dayanand Sonkamble, within DP road, the most infected containment zone is the Tadiwala road slum, with a population of 70,000 living in 13,000 houses.“We have, till date, found 350 positive cases in an area spanning about 1.5 square kilometres at the Tadiwala road slum. While their initial excuse to go out was to buy groceries, we started providing ration kits, then people ventured out to buy vegetables, for which we will now only allow vegetable vendors every three days and ensure social distancing is followed,” said Sonkamble.According to PMC officials, as of May 18, DP road ward has 700 cases while, Bhavani peth ward has reported 627 cases.In the Bhavani peth ward, which is another red zone, the Mahatma Phule slum is spread across an area of 1.5km. Sonkamble said that most of the cases identified in the area are employees of a nearby hospital where Covid-19 patients are being treated.Councillor Ajay Khedekar from ward 18 which is under Bhavani peth, covering most of the Mahatma Phule area, said that the youth in the area are often seeing venturing out and even play cards despite multiple efforts to ensure that they remain indoors.Khedekar said, “The Rapid Action Force (RAF) has been deployed in the area, but still we see people moving around. We must also consider the fact that there are about eight-10 people living in a 10x12 feet room and so social distancing is a luxury. Right now the PMC is also cleaning toilets at least three times a day and I have also installed sanitisers at every public toilet in my ward. We have also provided rations kits to people. Initially people hid the symptoms of Covid-19 fearing social boycott, which led to a rise in the number of cases. Mobile vans have also been deployed for swab collection so that people do not have to travel to distant places. Most of these people are uneducated and to explain social distancing became difficult, however, we are carrying out aggressive information campaigns.” Mahatma Phule slum is the most affected area within the Bhavani peth ward. Khedekar also said that many class four civic employees also live here who provide essential services to the city. “The employees move around the city and this could have been the reason for the spread,” he claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/650-cases-from-3-sq-km-area-of-tadiwala-mahatma-phule-peth-slum/story-iM3zHQPNSH6QXHPZg7A7MN.html
20-05-2020||Pune||Pune traders seek clarity on reopening of shops, says Fatehchand Ranka||Pune: The lockdown has left shopkeepers in Pune with an estimated loss of at least Rs one crore business, said Fatehchand Ranka, president of the Federation of Trade Association Pune. Ranka shares the steps taken to resume operations and following safety precautions. How are traders and businesses holding up?Ever since the lockdown, 30,000 traders in Pune have been badly affected. We have followed every rule announced by the authorities and even shut shops when required during the lockdown, but now patience is running out amid apprehension among traders of survival of their businesses.How badly has the business being affected?In the past three months, we have borne losses estimated to be about Rs one crore. There are several shops which are on rental basis. If the rent is not paid, they will lose the shop, leaving them no choice but to opt out of business.What kind of expectations do you have from the state and municipal corporation?We have entered phase 4 of the lockdown and the state government has been talking of relaxations, but nothing is clear about it nor have they intimated to us whether we can open our businesses. All they have allowed is for smaller shops of essential goods and those of electrical, electronics, furniture and essential clothing to open in non-containment zones, but it seems there is miscommunication between the local authorities for the police do not allow us to reach our shops to open for business.Are the shops ready for business?Yes, we are ready. We have already kept our staff on standby, given them training on how to work with gloves, masks and also have teams ready to sanitize shops. For those visiting shops, we have kept gloves and masks ready. And we will maintain social distancing and follow all the guidelines given by the government.Problems expected if shops are openThe shops being shut for three months is bad enough, but what we foresee as a problem is getting goods from manufacturing units. With many of the migratory labour gone home, there are hardly any skilled labour left to work on new products. It will be a problem if there is a heavy demand for new designs and products.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/traders-seek-clarity-on-reopening-of-shops/story-CYxbCVp1nBqglP0FFfwqVJ.html
20-05-2020||Pune||Lockdown impact: PMC extends property tax rebate scheme by one month||The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has given a one-month extension to avail the benefit of 5 to 10 per cent rebate scheme on property tax because to the prevailing Covid-19 situation.Hemant Rasane, PMC standing committee chairman, said due to the lockdown, citizens are unable to pay the tax and take benefit of the scheme.The last date for availing the benefit every year is May 31, but due to lockdown and a financial crunch, PMC standing committee has given a 1-month extension on the scheme. Now, the benefit can be availed until June 30, 2020.“We had given an extension for the rebate scheme for one more month. It will also help PMC to get more revenue as residents used to give a good response to the scheme in the past. Even elected members asked not to impose fine immediately if someone failed to repay the tax in time,” Rasane said.PMC is offering a rebate if the taxpayer pays property tax in the first two months of the financial year. Citizens who have tax below Rs 25,000 are getting 10 per cent discount in general tax and those having more than Rs 25,000 will be eligible for 5 per cent rebate.According to PMC property tax department chief Vilas Kanade, Covid-19 has financially impacted the property tax department.“In the previous year until May 18, PMC collected Rs 380 crore taxes through rebate scheme, but this year only Rs 150 crore has been received till date. We got permission from the standing committee for a one-month extension. Now the general body’s okay is awaited,” Kanade said.PMC had sent messages and link to property tax receipts for residents to pay bills online, but due to the lockdown people are unable to take benefit of the scheme like previous years, Kanade said.“Now the PMC has begun to send a hard copy of the property tax bills to citizens,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lockdown-affect-pmc-extends-tax-rebate-scheme-by-one-month/story-6wtWaAWUCgHnnOH3zEFw6L.html

20-05-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh touches 200 mark in 62 days||In just over two months, the tally of coronavirus disease cases has touched the 200 mark in Chandigarh, with three more people testing positive on Tuesday. However, in good news, as many as 37 patients – the highest in a single day — were discharged, taking the total number of recoveries to 91 and bringing the number of active cases down to 106.Among the new cases, two are from Bapu Dham Colony — two women aged 28 and 55 — while one is from Dhanas.The 34-year-old man from the Rehabilitation Colony in Dhanas had arrived from Delhi on May 17 and had gone straight to Government Multi Specialty Hospital, Sector 16, where he was sampled as he was symptomatic. The first case had surfaced in Chandigarh on March 18, when a 23-year-old woman, who flew back from England, tested positive following which restrictions on movement and business activities were imposed in the city. Even though restrictions have been relaxed in the city, fresh cases of infection — majorly from the Bapu Dham Colony containment zone — continue to come to the fore.Out of around 600 people sampled in Bapu Dham Colony, Sector 26, as many as 129 have been found infected. The chain was triggered by a resident who works as an operation theatre attendant at Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, after he was tested positive on April 24. The colony now accounts for 64.5% of the total cases in Chandigarh.Lagging behind on the testing, till April 24, the UT had sampled only 638 persons with the strict policy to test patients only with strong symptoms. However, after the Bapu Dham Colony outbreak, 2,393 suspected persons have been tested out of which 7.18% were found positive.With the testing numbers going up, fresh cases came to fore with total test positivity rate of Chandigarh standing at double the number of national average rate at one point of time. It reached its peak on May 11 with 8.3% of total persons tested turning positive. On Tuesday, test positivity rate stands at around 6.5% against 4.2% in India.The recovery rate for persons who have been tested negative after contracting infection stands at 29%, while after implementing the new discharge policy on Tuesday (which allows discharging asymptomatic and mild symptoms patients for home isolation), 34 patients have been discharged from the ayurvedic college in Sector 46. Three patients were also discharged from the PGIMER after two negative tests, including the GMCH-32 staffer from Bapu Dham Colony, who was first to test positive in the locality. With this the recovery rate has shot up to 45.5%.Dr BS Chavan, director principal, GMCH, said in strict implementation of Government of India’s new discharge policy, 34 patients have been discharged from the ayurvedic college in Sector 46 after 10 days of hospitalisation and have been kept in the post-discharge care centre in Sood Dharamshala.“Containing the situation in Bapu Dham Colony requires focus, not only in terms of screening, but testing as well as other methods available which are not as ‘sacred’ as testing but also can give effective results. Some of them which can be employed can be checking the oxygen saturation level of the persons within the containment zone majorly the high risk citizens,” a senior epidemiologist at the PGIMER, on the request of anonymity, said.The expert added that screening the whole population will not yield better results until persons with symptoms are tested.UT health secretary Arun Gupta said testing is being done strictly as per the protocol defined by the central government. “Testing numbers have increased gradually. More than 3,000 persons. At one point of time, doubling rate was 12 days, which is around 85 days now,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/two-new-covid-19-cases-in-chandigarh-take-total-count-of-positive-cases-to-199/story-6LN77Lrfk17TdJTpIhVFRN.html

He has separately accused the WHO and its director general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus personally of “missteps” of their own, including abetting China’s cover-up.With all 50 United States set to reopen partially President Trump stirred fresh controversy Tuesday saying he considered it a “badge of honor” that the United States had the highest number of infections in the world at 1.5 million, arguing it was a testimony to increased testing.Critics pounced on the president, arguing, he was taking credit for the highest number of infections.“So when we have a lot of cases, I don’t look at that as a bad thing; I look at that as -- in a certain respect, as being a good thing because it means our testing is much better,” he had said, “I view it as a badge of honor. Really, it’s a badge of honor.”There were 1.52 million confirmed Covid-19 cases in the United States till Wednesday morning and 91,983 fatalities, up by 20,260 and 1,574 in past 24 hours respectively. The total number of tests administered thus far was 12.6 million, according to the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).The high number of infections is a reflection of higher testing, as the president has argued in his defence, but critics have largely attributed them, and the high fatalities, to his administration delayed and botched initial response to the outbreak, which allowed the virus to spread rapidly unchallenged.President Trump has touted testing figures in recent days to counter criticism that the United States is not testing enough, specially with states reopening steadily. Public health officials have sought more testing to ensure lifting of curbs on public life did not lead to a resurgence as it has in countries.Connecticut became Wednesday the 50th American state to join the national reopening, allowing restaurants, malls and some outdoor activities to resume. As in a number of other states, rest of the economy and public life will be reopened in phases depending, determined by declining incidence of infections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-calls-covid-19-outbreak-mass-worldwide-killing-slams-china-for-incompetence/story-USaB6LTcq21KZrbMHNLlpJ.html
20-05-2020||World||Moderate increase in China’s defence budget likely in Covid-hit year, say experts||China is likely to increase its soon-to-be announced 2020 defence budget moderately in the backdrop of an epidemic-hit economy but also to have adequate resources to face challenges at home and abroad, military experts said Wednesday.The Chinese finance ministry is expected to announce the outlay for the sector on the first day of the National People’s Congress (NPC), China’s legislature, which begins for a delayed and short session on Friday.In March, 2019, Beijing announced a yearly budget of 1.19 trillion yuan ($177.5 billion), marking a 7.5 percent increase from the 2018 budget of 1.11 trillion yuan ($167.4 billion).Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageChina, the world’s second-largest economy, sank by a historic 6.8% in the first quarter of 2020 compared to a year earlier following a battering by the Covid-19 outbreak in the first quarter.“My personal opinion is that China’s military spending should increase moderately. The gap between China’s actual needs and the actual figures for military spending is huge, and the problems China faces are numerous and the dangers are growing,” Song Zhongping, Hong Kong-based military expert said.Among the external factors, Song highlighted China’s rising tension with the US, Taiwan’s, which China says is a breakaway region, “provocative statements”, Sino-India tension at the border and the volatile situation in the dispute ridden South China Sea.Shanghai-based military expert Ni Lexiong said many of China’s neighbours like India, Russia and Japan have joined the “arms race” in east Asia, an “…external factor that have prompted the mainland to significantly increase its military spending”.Ni, however, agreed that the government needs to maintain a balance in its defence budget – a balance between the domestic economic situation and the need for the armed forces.“Personally, I feel, the increase can’t be too much more than last year; but to increase it by less than last year, it will be suspected (by the international community) that China is weak. Therefore, a slight increase maybe a balanced move,” Ni said.“The moderate increase in China’s military spending is also in linewith the needs of our economic development; if the increase in GDP this year is 3%, 4%, I think the increase in military spending should be around 5% (more than last year),” Song said.Song added that the epidemic has also made the PLA aware of the need for increased military spending to improve its ability to respond to biological warfare.“China will not engage in an arms race no matter how much it increases its military spending. If military spending is raised to over 4% or 5% of GDP, it is called an arms race,” Song said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moderate-increase-in-china-s-defence-budget-likely-in-covid-hit-year-say-experts/story-Kc5Vn65VmjaoiJ7R0uZoWO.html
20-05-2020||World||US-based firm leads Covid-19 vaccine race, clinical trials show promising early results: Experts||As scientists across the world work frantically to find a vaccine against Covid-19, which continues its rapid global spread, all eyes are on US-based company Moderna’s encouraging early results on a small group of healthy volunteers. Cautioning that a vaccine is still months, maybe even a year away, experts said the US-based biotechnology firm‘s results have propelled it to a pole position in the race of 118, say experts.Eight candidate vaccines for Covid-19 are in the clinical evaluation, while 110 are in the preclinical stage, according to the WHO’s latest draft landscape.  Preclinical development is a stage of research during which important feasibility, iterative testing and drug safety data are collected, while clinical trials are research studies performed on people.Early data from its vaccine candidate “mRNA-1273” showed it produced protective antibodies in a group of eight healthy volunteers, Moderna said.The other closely watched Covid-19 vaccine is the one being developed by scientists at Oxford University. It appears protective in a small study of six monkeys, promising findings that led to the start of human trials late last month.“Because Moderna’s is the only vaccine having demonstrated any kind of immunologic response in the Covid-19 field, we would consider this to be the leading candidate,” said Michael Breen, associate director, Infectious Disease, at GlobalData, a UK-based data analytics and consulting company. “Of the vaccines in human trials, only two have demonstrated any kind of effectiveness,” Breen told PTI, noting that the Moderna study proves that the platform can lead to the production of antibodies against a given virus.Moderna on Monday announced positive interim clinical data of mRNA-1273, from the Phase 1 study led by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).The data comes from eight people who took part in a 45-subject safety trial that kicked off in March.The study showed the vaccine was safe and all study participants produced antibodies against the virus, according to the company. “Globally, one vaccine candidate that is promising is Moderna’s mRNA based vaccine that showed promising results in the early trials,” Upasana Ray, assistant professor at CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology in Kolkata, told PTI.RNA is the genetic material of the viruses. While conventional vaccines are developed with an inactivated virus or using proteins made by virus,  messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines work by introducing a synthetic sequence of the viruses’ genetic material that encodes the disease-specific protein to trigger the body’s immune system, the experts explained.Discussing the Oxford University vaccine, she said the work “deserves applause but needs additional supportive information and experiments”.The preliminary findings of the Oxford study appeared on the preprint server bioRxiv. A preprint is a full draft research paper that is shared publicly before it has been peer reviewed or published in a journal.British drug maker AstraZeneca teamed up with researchers at the Oxford Vaccine Group and the Jenner Institute in developing the vaccine.Breen described their “ChAdOx1 nCoV-19” candidate vaccine as a “standout”. “While this vaccine has yet to demonstrate efficacy in humans, it was shown to be able to prevent infection and disease from Covid-19 in a primate model,” he said. While this needs to be replicated in humans, it is one of only two vaccines to have demonstrated any effectiveness in reducing infection due to Covid-19, making it a “highly interesting candidate”.Though the Moderna and the Oxford vaccines are in a leading position, there are several other vaccines, including those being developed in India, in the running.In India, eight organisations are in the fray with a vaccine candidate , half of which are companies and the other half non-industry, said Brooke Wilson, associate director, Healthcare, GlobalData.  “These organisations are running or planning to initiate 12 clinical trials, one is ongoing, recruiting and the other 11 are planned,” Wilson told PTI.He explained that six of these trials are specifically for a Covid-19 vaccine while the other six trials use a vaccine developed for other indications, such as tuberculosis, adding that the majority of the trials are in Phase I, followed by Phase 3 and Phase 2. Explaining the various phases in the development of a vaccine, E. Sreekumar, chief scientific officer at the Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology (RGCB) in Kerala, said Phase 1 trials are small-scale, usually involving few participants, to assess whether the vaccine is safe for humans. Phase 2 trials often involve several hundred subjects, and mainly evaluate the efficacy.  “The final phase involves thousands of people to further assess the efficacy of the vaccine over a defined period of time, and can last several months, Sreekumar said.  Breen also mentioned China-based Sinovac Biotech’s PiCoVacc vaccine which he said has demonstrated efficacy in non-human primates, similar to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19.However, he said Sinovac Biotech does not have the global marketing capabilities of AstraZeneca, which could impact worldwide availability of their vaccine.In another animal trial, researchers from Fudan University in China last week announced that a single dose of a  SARS-CoV-2 simulating particle vaccine induces potent neutralising activities in mice.“These results support further development of ShaCoVacc as a candidate vaccine for Covid-19,” the researchers wrote in a paper that appeared in preprint platform BioRxiv.A vaccine is designed to protect people before they’re exposed to a virus -- in this case, SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19 -- according to the WHO.It basically trains the immune system to recognise and attack the virus when it encounters it, the world health body noted.“Vaccine development involves many steps starting from designing the candidate, mice immunisation studies and neutralising antibody repertoire testing, other animal immunisation trials like in ferrets, human safety checks, human trials of various levels before it is approved for general use,” said Ray This entire process, she noted, takes at least 12-18 months.“However, the extent of worldwide effort been taken in this area is commendable and promising showing hope of a possible efficient vaccine in near future,’’ Ray added.Umashankar Singh, assistant professor, biological engineering, IIT-Gandhinagar told PTI that the number of different approaches employed for Covid-19 are impressive. “My personal understanding is that all of these strategies will yield results that may suit different profiles of recipients and might end up providing immunity, not exclusively though, against different strains of this virus that will emerge, if not there already,” he said. The number of Covid-19 cases is close to five million in 188 countries and region with more than 3,23,000 fatalities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-based-firm-leads-covid-19-vaccine-race-clinical-trials-show-promising-early-results-experts/story-LzMG08tvBkNitUupa5MyRN.html
20-05-2020||World||Coronavirus coming from India ‘more lethal’ than those from China, Italy: Nepal PM||Nepal Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli has said the coronavirus coming from India is “more lethal” than those from China and Italy and blamed the rising number of Covid-19 cases in the Himalayan nation on those illegally entering the country from India, as the total number of Covid-19 cases jumped to 427 on Wednesday. Speaking about the COVID-19 pandemic in Parliament on Tuesday, Oli said it has become very difficult for Nepal to contain the spread of the deadly virus due to the flow of people from outside. “Many coronavirus infected patients have entered into Nepal. The virus came from outside, as we did not have here before. We could not stop infiltration of people from outside the border,” he said. Oli said that the biggest challenge facing the country today is the rising number of coronavirus cases and blamed the rising number of coronavirus cases on individuals breaking the nationwide lockdown, especially those sneaking into Nepal from India. “The coronavirus coming from India are more lethal than those from China and Italy,” he said. “Those who are coming from India through illegal channels are spreading the virus in the country and some local representatives and party leaders are responsible for bringing in people from India without proper testing,” Oli was quoted as saying by the Kathmandu Post. Oli’s remarks came amid Nepal’s border row with India after the construction of a key road connecting the Lipulekh pass with Dharchula in Uttarakhand. He said the Nepal government has been following precautionary measures since early time to stop the spread of the virus. “It is the main priority of the government to make the country free from coronavirus,” he said. There were reports of hundreds of people entering the country daily through different border points despite the deployment of security personnel at all major entry points along the Nepal-India border to check cross-border movement of people during the lockdown. Earlier this month, Prime Minister Oli had instructed authorities to intensify the vigil along the country’s southern border with India due to a sudden spike in the number of coronavirus patients and directed the officials to properly manage the lockdown. The nationwide lockdown imposed to contain the spread of the coronavirus has been extended until June 2. The coronavirus cases in Nepal on Wednesday rose to 427 after 25 new infection cases were confirmed, the Health Ministry said. Two persons, a man and a woman, have died due to COVID-19 in the country so far. Prime Minister Oli on Tuesday asserted that Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura belong to Nepal and vowed to “reclaim” them from India through political and diplomatic efforts, as his Cabinet endorsed a new political map showing the three areas as Nepalese territory. Addressing Parliament, Oli said the territories belong to Nepal “but India has made it a disputed area by keeping its Army there”. “Nepalis were blocked from going there after India stationed its Army,” he said. The Lipulekh pass is a far western point near Kalapani, a disputed border area between Nepal and India. Both India and Nepal claim Kalapani as an integral part of their territory - India as part of Uttarakhand’s Pithoragarh district and Nepal as part of Dharchula district. India has said that the recently-inaugurated road section in Pithoragarh district in Uttarakhand lies completely within its territory. Indian Army chief Gen MM Naravane last week said that there were reasons to believe that Nepal objected to India’s newly-inaugurated road linking Lipulekh Pass with Dharchula in Uttarakhand at the behest of “someone else”, in an apparent reference to a possible role by China on the matter. He said there was no dispute whatsoever between India and Nepal in the area and road laid was very much within the Indian side.

The government wants to extend it until June 7.The vote is expected to be close, although Sánchez’s minority government composed of his Socialists and an anti-austerity party has secured the important backing of the center-right Citizens party.Sánchez’s support has been waning with every vote to extend the state of emergency, which gives the government the power to restrict Constitutional rights such as free movement and assembly key to its sanitary lockdown. The main opposition party, the conservative Popular Party, has said it will vote “No.” Also, the governmental gazette published the order that will require everyone over six years old to wear face masks in a closed public space or outdoors if a two-meter (6.5-foot) social distance cannot be guaranteed starting Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-spanish-pm-asks-to-extend-state-of-emergency-again/story-WpjyjXMTYmel96jb7FjcNL.html

Some of the masks had a red stain on them, after lab testing it was found those were paan stain.”“As per our hospital protocol, we destroyed all kits to ensure no infection gets spread in our hospital. It’s shameful that after receiving fake Made-in-China testing machine, AJK has now become a dumping ground for used PPE kits,” the Twitter thread added.The hospital was constructed with humanitarian assistance donated by Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the President of the United Arab Emirates to alleviate the sufferings of the people of the region, who were affected from the devastating earthquake in 2005.Pakistan’s tally of coronavirus cases soared to 45,898, with 1,932 new ones reported on Wednesday.With poor testing and trained medical staff, PoK has registered 133 Covid-19 cases whereas Gilgit Baltistan has reported 556 positive cases.Earlier, the doctors in PoK held protests against the government for its failure to provide PPE kits to treat Covid-19 patients.However, many of these healthcare workers denied going to hospitals without PPE kits, which have affected the testing and treatment of suspected coronavirus patients.Islamabad has been discriminately treating PoK and Gilgit Baltistan during the outbreak, which has directly affected the lives of people in the regions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-hospitals-in-pok-get-used-ppe-kits-masks-with-paan-stains/story-R2UOAHrEM0nHZdW20CMamN.html

We are taking all possible measures that we should adopt for protecting the lives and properties of the people from the cyclone,” Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina told a meeting of the National Disaster Management Council (NDMC) formed to review the preparations in facing the possible assault of the super cyclone.“Twenty lakh people have so far been evacuated to the cyclone centres as part of the prior preparation. As many as 13,241 cyclone shelter centres have already been opened to this end,” Hasina was quoted as saying by The Daily Star newspaper. The Bangladesh Army, Navy and Air Force have made preparations to tackle the super cyclone which has moved within 400km of Bangladesh’s coast and is expected to make landfall on Wednesday evening, Bdnews24.com reported. The cyclone is expected to make landfall at 6pm on Wednesday, State Minister for Disaster Management and Relief Enamur Rahman was quoted as saying by the report. On Tuesday, the authorities began to move nearly 2.2 million people to storm shelters to avoid casualties. The Navy has deployed 25 ships as part of three-tier efforts to conduct emergency rescue, relief and medical operations in the immediate aftermath of the super cyclone, the report said. Two maritime patrol aircraft and two helicopters were also at the ready to conduct search operations over the Bay of Bengal and in the coastal districts, the Inter Services Public Relations Directorate (ISPR) said. The Army has prepared 18,400 packets of relief materials and formed 71 medical teams. As many as 145 disaster management teams with special equipment are also ready to be deployed at short notice, the ISPR said. The Army Aviation Group would join rescue and relief operations, it said. The Air Force will assess the possible damage along with medical, relief and rescue efforts by using six transport aircraft and 22 helicopters, it said. Meanwhile, the Bangladesh Meteorological Department on Wednesday advised ten coastal districts to hoist the ‘Great Danger Signal Number 10’ as Cyclone Amphan has moved closer to Bangladesh’s coast, the Dhaka Tribune reported. Coastal districts of Satkhira, Khulna, Bagherhat, Jhalokathi, Pirozpur, Barguna, Patuakhali, Bhola, Barishal, Laxmipur, Chandpur and their offshore islands and chars will come under great danger signal number 10, the report said. The meteorologists said the world’s largest mangrove forest, the Sundarbans, was likely to absorb the main brunt of the Amphan onslaughts as it has done many times over the centuries, leading to a less number of human casualties. “The Sundarbans always absorbed the brunt of cyclones whichever hit the coastlines alongside the Bangladesh-India, we expect the forest to face the initial impact of Amphan like foot soldiers this time as well,” Bangladesh’s Meteorology Department Director Shamsuddin Ahmed told reporters on Tuesday. Leading global storm tracker AccuWeather on Tuesday described Amphan as the first super cyclone in the Bay of Bengal since 1999, fearing the “ferocious” storm to unleash extreme impacts across Bangladeshi and northeastern Indian coastlines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cyclone-amphan-bangladesh-shifts-over-two-million-people-armed-forces-put-on-alert/story-cR9w1cyKuGJFWzv1tJ9zfO.html
20-05-2020||World||Russia reports record high daily coronavirus death toll with over 300,000 cases||Russia’s coronavirus case tally, the second highest in the world, passed 300,000 on Wednesday, but a representative from the World Health Organisation (WHO) said the situation was starting to stabilise. Russia’s 8,764 new novel coronavirus infections took the nationwide total to 308,705. But the daily increase was the lowest since May 1.Only the United States has reported more cases than Russia, though the Russian death rate remains much lower than many other countries, something that has been queried by some critics and relatives of those who have died. Russia says the way it counts deaths is more accurate than others however and has defended its approach. The overall death toll edged up to 2,972 on Wednesday, with 135 new fatalities reported in the past 24 hours, the country’s coronavirus response centre said. Dr. Melita Vujnovich, the WHO’s Russia representative, said on Wednesday that she believed the situation had entered a stabilisation phase, the TASS news agency cited her as saying. In Moscow, Russia’s worst hit-region now in its eighth week of a lockdown, citizens remain largely confined to their homes unless they obtain digital passes to make certain journeys. Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said on Tuesday it was too soon to consider letting people out for walks or exercise.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-reports-record-high-daily-coronavirus-death-toll-with-over-300-000-cases/story-uQup8cJklvZzCijgLZdSvK.html
20-05-2020||World||China’s new outbreak shows signs Covid-19 could be changing||Chinese doctors are seeing the coronavirus manifest differently among patients in its new cluster of cases in the northeast region compared to the original outbreak in Wuhan, suggesting that the pathogen may be changing in unknown ways and complicating efforts to stamp it out.Patients found in the northern provinces of Jilin and Heilongjiang appear to carry the virus for a longer period of time and take longer to test negative, Qiu Haibo, one of China’s top critical care doctors, told state television on Tuesday.Patients in the northeast also appear to be taking longer than the one to two weeks observed in Wuhan to develop symptoms after infection, and this delayed onset is making it harder for authorities to catch cases before they spread, said Qiu, who is now in the northern region treating patients.“The longer period during which infected patients show no symptoms has created clusters of family infections,” said Qiu, who was earlier sent to Wuhan to help in the original outbreak. Some 46 cases have been reported over the past two weeks spread across three cities -- Shulan, Jilin city and Shengyang -- in two provinces, a resurgence of infection that sparked renewed lockdown measures over a region of 100 million people.Scientists still do not fully understand if the virus is changing in significant ways and the differences Chinese doctors are seeing could be due to the fact that they’re able to observe patients more thoroughly and from an earlier stage than in Wuhan. When the outbreak first exploded in the central Chinese city, the local health-care system was so overwhelmed that only the most serious cases were being treated. The northeast cluster is also far smaller than Hubei’s outbreak, which ultimately sickened over 68,000 people.Still, the findings suggest that the remaining uncertainty over how the virus manifests will hinder governments’ efforts to curb its spread and re-open their battered economies. China has one of the most comprehensive virus detection and testing regimes globally and yet is still struggling to contain its new cluster.Researchers worldwide are trying to ascertain if the virus is mutating in a significant way to become more contagious as it races through the human population, but early research suggesting this possibility has been criticized for being overblown.“In theory, some changes in the genetic structure can lead to changes in the virus structure or how the virus behaves,” said Keiji Fukuda, director and clinical professor at the University of Hong Kong’s School of Public Health. “However, many mutations lead to no discernible changes at all.”It’s likely that the observations in China don’t have a simple correlation with a mutation and “very clear evidence” is needed before concluding that the virus is mutating, he said.Northeast DifferencesQiu said that doctors have also noticed patients in the northeast cluster seem to have damage mostly in their lungs, whereas patients in Wuhan suffered multi-organ damage across the heart, kidney and gut.Officials now believe that the new cluster stemmed from contact with infected arrivals from Russia, which has one of the worst outbreaks in Europe. Genetic sequencing has showed a match between the northeast cases and Russian-linked ones, said Qiu.Among the northeast cluster, only 10% have turned critical and 26 are hospitalized.Over 100 Million in China’s Northeast Face Renewed LockdownChina is moving aggressively to stem the spread of the new cluster ahead of its annual political gathering in Beijing scheduled to start this week. As thousands of delegates stream into the capital to endorse the government’s agenda, China’s central leadership is determined to project stability and control.The northeast provinces have ordered a return of lockdown measures, halting train services, closing schools and sealing off residential compounds, dismaying residents who had thought the worst was over.“People should not assume the peak has passed or let down their guard,” Wu Anhua, a senior infectious disease doctor, said on state television on Tuesday. “It’s totally possible that the epidemic will last for a long time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-new-outbreak-shows-signs-covid-19-could-be-changing/story-6TDK0KB47wR9XeHqWOHrRO.html
20-05-2020||World||UK inflation slumps to lowest since 2016 as coronavirus hits||Britain’s inflation rate sank in April to its lowest since August 2016 as the coronavirus pandemic pushed down global oil prices and clothing stores slashed prices, bolstering the prospect of more Bank of England stimulus next month.Consumer price inflation dropped to an annual rate of 0.8 per cent from 1.5 per cent in March, official data showed on Wednesday. That was the sharpest one-month fall in over a decade and took inflation further below the BoE’s 2 per cent target. Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent has said it could drop below zero by the end of 2020.The BoE increased its bond-buying programme by a record 200 billion pounds in March as the per cent crisis escalated, and many economists expect another increase on June 18.Markets see a chance the BoE could cut interest rates below zero for the first time by the end of the year.Ruth Gregory, an economist with Capital Economics, said underlying price growth would stay subdued as weak demand more than offset any inflationary impact from the pandemic. “Against this background, we expect the Bank to expand its quantitative easing programme further,” she said.The Office for National Statistics says inflation readings were likely to be volatile because the coronavirus shutdown has kept its price-checkers from getting prices on more than a fifth of goods and services, forcing the ONS to estimate them or use substitutes.Declining prices for energy bills, transport - which includes petrol - and clothing and footwear, causing biggest drop in inflation.The ONS said clothing retailers, hit by the government’s stay-at-home orders, resorted to more discount sales and prices dropped by the most since 2010, down an annual 2.9 per cent.Household utility bills dropped by the most since 2009, reflecting previously announced price caps.But there was upward pressure from the price of video games and consoles, board games and children’s toys, as well as fresh vegetables, the ONS said.Core inflation, which excludes energy, food, alcohol and tobacco, held broadly steady at an annual rate of 1.5 per cent.Retail price inflation - an older measure which the ONS says is inaccurate, but is widely used in bond markets and for other commercial contracts - dropped to 1.5 per cent from 2.6 per cent.The dip in the CPI below 1 per cent will require BoE Governor Andrew Bailey to explain to the government how the central bank will attempt to push it back up.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-inflation-slumps-to-lowest-since-2016-as-coronavirus-hits/story-dKFz4vli2h31eEmK7OGZqO.html
20-05-2020||World||Eid-ul-Fitr amid Covid-19 crisis: What countries have announced so far||The Islamic holy month of Ramadan is nearing an end amid the coronavirus crisis. Scores of countries, including India, are under lockdown to curb the rising incidence of Covid-19 infections. Last month, during the commencement of Ramadan, governments across the globe and Islamic leaders had urged the Muslim community to offer prayers from home and not to congregate amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Mosques bore a deserted look in the absence of devotees owing to the global outbreak of coronavirus. With Eid-ul-Fitr celebration just around the corner, Islamic leaders have urged people to stay indoors and avoid large gatherings on the occasion of Eid. Also read: Timing, date of Eid and impact of coronavirusEarlier this week, Darul Uloom Deoband, India’s leading Islamic seminary, issued a fatwa urging Muslims to offer their Eid prayers at home instead of congregating at mosques. The fatwa said the Eid namaz can be offered in the same manner that the Friday prayers are now being read at home.The Muslim Council of Britain also issued a similar directive asking people to celebrate Eid virtually keeping the prevailing coronavirus situation in mind.Islamic and Gulf nations like Saudia Arabia have extended lockdown for the period of Eid holidays keeping the rising number of coronavirus cases in view.Egypt has said it will bring forward the start of its curfew by four hours to 5 pm and halt public transport from May 24 for six days during the Eid holiday.Shops, restaurants, parks and beaches will be closed for the extended holiday at the end of the holy month of Ramadan. Restrictions on citizens’ movements will remain in place for at least two weeks afterwards, Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly said on Sunday.Saudi Arabia too has introduced a nationwide 24-hour curfew during the Eid holidays amid the coronavirus crisis. The curfew will apply from May 23 to May 27.In Jordan, there will be restrictions of movement of vehicles on the first day of Eid. The curfew will now begin at 8 pm, instead of 10 pm, and will last till 6 am. On Monday, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said a four-day lockdown, starting May 23, would be imposed nationwide, to prevent the spread of coronavirus during the Eid holidays.The month of Ramazan is the holiest of the year as per the Islamic tradition and lasts for around 28 to 30 days depending on the sighting of the moon. The month-long fasting or Sawm (fasting from dawn till dusk) is one of the five pillars of Islam and is observed by Muslims across the world during Ramadan. The day starts with partaking a meal at the crack of dawn and ends by breaking the fast after sunset and saying the evening prayer Magrib.

20-05-2020||World||Annie Glenn, widow of astronaut and US senator John Glenn, dies at 100||Annie Glenn, the widow of astronaut and US Senator John Glenn and a communication disorders advocate, died Tuesday of complications from Covid-19. She was 100.Glenn died at a nursing home near St Paul, Minnesota, said Hank Wilson, a spokesman for the Glenn College of Public Affairs at The Ohio State University.At the time of John Glenn’s death in 2016, the two had been married 73 years. She had moved out of the apartment they shared in Columbus in recent years and gone to live with her daughter, Lyn, according to Wilson.Annie Glenn was thrust into the spotlight in 1962, when her husband became the first American to orbit Earth. She shied away from the media attention because of a severe stutter.Later, she underwent an intensive programme at the Communications Research Institute at Hollins College, now Hollins University, in Roanoke, Virginia, that gave her the skills to control her stutter and to speak in public.By the time 77-year-old John Glenn returned to space in 1998 aboard space shuttle Discovery, Annie showed she had become comfortable in her public role when she acknowledged that she had reservations about the retired senator’s second flight.“John had announced one year before that he was going to retire as a senator, so I was looking forward to having him as my own because I had given him to our government for 55 years,” she told a NASA interviewer.Her career in advocacy for those with communication disorders included service on the advisory boards of numerous child abuse and speech and hearing organisations. The Annie Glenn Award was created to honour individuals who overcome a communication disorder.Defense Secretary William Cohen honoured Annie Glenn with the Department of Defense Medal for Outstanding Public Service in 1998. He called her “a hero in her own right” and praised her for being “a strong voice for children, speech and communications, and the disabled.” In 2009, Glenn received an honorary doctorate of public service from Ohio State, where she served as an adjunct professor of speech pathology in the Department of Speech and Hearing Science. The department bestows an Annie Glenn Leadership Award annually.Glenn was born Anna Margaret Castor on February 17, 1920, in Columbus. She met her husband while they were children growing up in New Concord. She was offered an organ scholarship to The Julliard School, but World War II began and John proposed — so she decided to stay with him, according to a biography on the Glenn College’s website. The high school sweethearts attended Muskingum College and were married in 1943. They had two children, David and Lyn.The Glenns served on the board of trustees of the college, now Muskingum University, and Annie Glenn was named a distinguished alumni fellow in speech communications at the school.A virtual memorial service will be held on Saturday, June 6, 2020, at 11 am EDT. The service will be officiated by the Rev. Amy Miracle, pastor for the Broad Street Presbyterian Church in Columbus. The memorial will be virtual with no parishioners or guests in attendance due to the Covid-19 restrictions.She is survived by her two children.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/annie-glenn-widow-of-astronaut-and-us-senator-john-glenn-dies-at-100/story-8umlcqYtLrYbizimrFtHYN.html

We will not accept the Beijing authorities’ use of ‘one country, two systems’ to downgrade Taiwan and undermine the cross-strait status quo. We stand fast by this principle,” Tsai said.China uses the “one country, two systems” policy, which is supposed to guarantee a high degree of autonomy, to run the former British colony of Hong Kong, which returned to Chinese rule in 1997. It has offered it to Taiwan, though all major Taiwanese parties have rejected it.China’s Taiwan Affairs Office, responding to Tsai, said Beijing would stick to “one country, two systems” - a central tenet of Chinese President Xi Jinping’s Taiwan policy - and “not leave any space for Taiwan independence separatist activities”.“Reunification is a historical inevitability of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation,” it said. “We have the firm will, full confidence, and sufficient ability to defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity.”China views Tsai as a separatist bent on formal independence for Taiwan. Tsai says Taiwan is an independent state called the Republic of China, its official name, and does not want to be part of the People’s Republic of China governed by Beijing.TAIWAN OPEN TO DIALOGUEChina has stepped up its military drills near Taiwan since Tsai’s re-election, flying fighter jets into the island’s air space and sailing warships around Taiwan.Tsai said Taiwan has made the greatest effort to maintain peace and stability in the narrow Taiwan Strait that separates the democratic island from its autocratic neighbour China.“We will continue these efforts, and we are willing to engage in dialogue with China and make more concrete contributions to regional security,” she added, speaking in the garden of the old Japanese governor’s house in Taipei, in front of a socially-distanced audience of officials and diplomats.Taiwan has become a rising source of friction between China and the United States, with the Trump administration strongly backing Taiwan even in the absence of formal diplomatic ties. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo sent his congratulations to Tsai on Tuesday, praising her “courage and vision in leading Taiwan’s vibrant democracy”, in a rare high-level message from Washington direct to Taiwan’s government.China’s Foreign Ministry condemned Pompeo’s remarks, and said the government would take “necessary countermeasures”, though did not elaborate.China cut off a formal talks mechanism with Taiwan in 2016 after Tsai first won election.Yao Chia-wen, a senior adviser to Tsai, told Reuters the chance of talks with China were small given ongoing tensions.“We are ready to engage with them any time, but China is unlikely to make concessions to Taiwan,” he said. “In the next four years there’s little chance for the cross-strait relationship to improve.” (Reporting by Yimou Lee and Ben Blanchard; Additional reporting by Huizhong Wu in Beijing; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman and Michael Perry)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/won-t-tolerate-taiwan-s-freedom-says-china-tsai-bats-for-coexistence/story-YQWSzPdJzF8OhwXR1gM8bO.html

While the US has carefully crafted interactions with Taipei to avoid recognizing its government, Pompeo’s statement Tuesday referred to Tsai as president and called Taiwan a “force for good in the world and a reliable partner.”“China urges the US side to immediately correct its mistakes,” the ministry said in a statement posted on its website Wednesday. “The Chinese side will take necessary countermeasures to respond to the above-mentioned erroneous actions by the US side. And the US side should bear the consequences arising therefrom.”Congratulations to Dr. Tsai Ing-wen on the commencement of your second-term as Taiwan’s President. Taiwan’s vibrant democracy is an inspiration to the region and the world. With President Tsai at the helm, our partnership with Taiwan will continue to flourish.Earlier in the day, Tsai urged China to “find a way to co-exist” with Taiwan’s democratic government as she was sworn in to her second term in Taipei.

20-05-2020||World||Global emissions cut during lockdown may not last long, warn scientists||The momentous decline in global greenhouse gas emissions, fuelled by the wave of shutdowns and shuttered economies caused by the coronavirus pandemic, is unlikely to last long, said a group of scientists, who fear that the drivers of global warming could quickly bounce back as social distancing ends and economies rebound.The Washington Post on Tuesday reported that as infections surged in March and April, countries across the world experienced an abrupt reduction in driving, flying and industrial output, leading to a startling decline of more than 1 billion tons of carbon dioxide emissions.That includes a peak drop in daily emissions of 17 per cent in early April, according to the study, published in the journal Nature Climate Change. For some nations, the falloff was much steeper.Scientists have long insisted that the world must scale back carbon pollution significantly -- and quickly -- to mitigate the worst effects of climate change over the coming decades.Tuesday’s study projects that total emissions for 2020 will probably fall between 4 and 7 per cent compared with last year. The final 2020 figure will depend on how rapidly or cautiously, people around the world resume ordinary life, the scientists said.The unprecedented situation produced by coronavirus has offered a glimpse at the massive cuts in global emissions, year after year, that would be required to meet the most ambitious goals set by world leaders when they forged the 2015 Paris climate accord.Last fall, a United Nations report estimated that global greenhouse gas emissions must begin falling by 7.6 per cent each year beginning in 2020 to avoid the worst effects of climate change.But the changes are unlikely to last.“History suggests this will be a blip,” said Rob Jackson, a Stanford University professor and one of the authors of the peer-reviewed study, which attempts to assess the virus’s effect by nation and economic sector.“The 2008 (financial) crisis decreased global emissions by 1.5 per cent for one year, and they shot back up 5 per cent in 2010. It was like it never happened,” he added.Already, the demand for energy is resuming as people return to the roads and many US states have begun easing stay-at-home orders that helped drive the price per gallon of gasoline to less than USD 1 at some pumps.Governments also are expected to begin trying to boost their economies with stimulus spending in the coming months. But how leaders decide to spend that money could make a fundamental difference.Some world leaders have also pledged to push for greener economies in the wake of the pandemic.Last week, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that his country’s effort to slash its emissions remains “undiminished” by the coronavirus and the economic turmoil it has caused. He singled out airlines during remarks in the Parliament, saying the sector must limit its carbon emissions even when normal flights resume.Last month, German Chancellor Angela Merkel indicated that she would support green investments as her nation seeks to restore its economy.Although some aspects of life may change in the wake of the pandemic -- more people working remotely, fewer people commuting and taking frequent plane trips -- individual changes are unlikely to make much of a long-term mark on emissions, said Zeke Hausfather, a scientist and director of climate and energy at the Breakthrough Institute.“Unless anything structurally changes, we can expect emissions to go back to where they were before this whole thing happened,” he was quoted as saying.Hausfather also said that one year of sharp reductions in emissions would do little to stave off the warming that scientists have said will continue unless the world significantly cuts emissions for good.“I do not think there is much of a silver lining to COVID-19 for the climate. unless we use the recovery as a chance to both stimulate the economy and build the type of infrastructure to support a clean-energy future.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/global-emissions-cut-during-lockdown-may-not-last-long-warn-scientists/story-m11eT6KDEaeC63sQUU9IdI.html
20-05-2020||World||Man sentenced to death in Singapore via Zoom call||A man has been sentenced to death in Singapore via a Zoom video-call for his role in a drug deal, the city-state’s first case where capital punishment has been delivered remotely.Punithan Genasan, a 37-year-old Malaysian, received the sentence for his role in a 2011 heroin transaction on Friday, court documents showed, with the country under lockdown to try and curb one of the highest coronavirus rates in Asia. “For the safety of all involved in the proceedings, the hearing for Public Prosecutor v Punithan A/L Genasan was conducted by video-conferencing,” a spokesperson for Singapore’s Supreme Court said in response to Reuters’ questions, citing restrictions imposed to minimise virus spread. It was the first criminal case where a death sentence was pronounced by remote hearing in Singapore, the spokesperson added. Genasan’s lawyer, Peter Fernando, said his client received the judge’s verdict on a Zoom call and is considering an appeal.While rights groups have criticised the use of Zoom in capital cases, Fernando said he did not object to the use of video-conferencing for Friday’s call since it was only to receive the judge’s verdict, which could be heard clearly, and no other legal arguments were presented.    California-based tech firm Zoom did not immediately respond to a request for comment made via its representatives in Singapore. The Attorney General’s Chambers, the public prosecutor, referred Reuters’ questions to the Supreme Court.Many court hearings in Singapore have been adjourned during a lockdown period that started in early April and is due to run until June 1, while cases deemed essential have been held remotely. Singapore has a zero-tolerance policy for illegal drugs and has hanged hundreds of people - including dozens of foreigners - for narcotics offences over past decades, rights groups say.“Singapore’s use of the death penalty is inherently cruel and inhumane, and the use of remote technology like Zoom to sentence a man to death makes it even more so,” said Phil Robertson, deputy director of Human Rights Watch’s Asia division. HRW has also criticised a similar case in Nigeria where a death sentence was delivered via Zoom.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/man-sentenced-to-death-in-singapore-via-zoom-call/story-ylk1ogjDwmOiumy5CFHopI.html

The pandemic has killed at least 17,971 people in Brazil, according to the Health Ministry.Brazil overtook Britain on Monday to become the country with the third-highest number of confirmed infections, behind Russia and the United States. Brazil’s confirmed cases also jumped by a record 17,408 on Tuesday, for a total of 271,628 people who have tested positive for the virus. Bolsonaro, an ideological ally of Trump, has been criticized for his handling of the outbreak, such as opposition to restrictions on movement he sees as too damaging to the economy.Bolsonaro said Interim Health Minister Eduardo Pazuello would issue new guidelines on Wednesday expanding the recommended use of the anti-malarial drug chloroquine to treat the coronavirus.Two trained doctors have resigned as Health Minister in the past month as Bolsonaro defies public health expert advice.Bolsonaro told website Blog do Magno that Pazuello, an active-duty army general, would sign the new chloroquine guidelines and keep the top job for now. Bolsonaro added that his mother is 93 years old, and he keeps a box of chloroquine on hand should she need it. Trump, who announced on Monday he was taking chloroquine preventively, told reporters on Tuesday: “I don’t want people coming over here and infecting our people. I don’t want people over there sick either. We’re helping Brazil with ventilators ... Brazil is having some trouble, no question about it.”Pan American Health Organization officials said in a virtual briefing they were concerned about the virus’ spread in the tri-border area of the Amazon between Colombia, Peru and Brazil. They urged special measures to protect vulnerable populations among the indigenous, poor and racial minorities.

20-05-2020||World||Trump administration signs up new company to make Covid-19 drugs in US||US President Donald Trump’s administration awarded a contract worth up to $812 million for a new US company to manufacture drugs and drug ingredients to fight Covid-19 on American soil, aiming to end dependence on other countries.The administration has been looking to build up the ability to produce drugs and their raw materials in the United States after the global pandemic exposed the industry’s dependence on China and India for its supply chain.“For far too long, we’ve relied on foreign manufacturing and supply chains for our most important medicines and active pharmaceutical ingredients while placing America’s health, safety, and national security at grave risk,” Peter Navarro, director of the White House Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy, said in a statement.Navarro for months has been advocating that Trump issue an executive order to require federal agencies to buy US-made medical supplies and pharmaceuticals.The U.S Department of Health and Human Services said it had awarded a four-year, $354 million contract to privately-held Phlow Corp to make Covid-19 drugs, other essential drugs and their ingredients. The contract - which is for generic drugs, not more complicated products like vaccines - can be extended to a total of $812 million over 10 years.Phlow, which was incorporated in January, said the contract will help it contribute to a national stockpile of pharmaceutical ingredients for essential medicines.The company is run by Eric Edwards, who previously founded the drug company Kaleo Pharmaceuticals with his twin brother. He said in an interview that Phlow initially reached out to the US health department last November, to tell them that they were working to build US drug manufacturing capacity.After Covid-19 hit, Edwards said Phlow focused on drugs for the virus and reached out to Navarro’s office and government agencies. “We said, ‘You’re going to have a problem.’ The supply chain was already vulnerable, with all of these drug shortages before Covid-19,” he said. The company submitted a proposal on drug manufacturing in response to an open request from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, one of the HHS agencies overseeing Covid-19 vaccine and drug development, he said.Phlow has already started making pharmaceutical ingredients and finished dosage forms for over a dozen medicines to treat hospitalized patients with Covid-19-related illnesses, including medicines for pain management, sedation for ventilators, blood pressure support for critical patients and antibiotics.All pharmaceutical products will be made in the United States, according to Phlow’s website. The company said it is working to build advanced manufacturing capability in Virginia, as well as sterile manufacturing facilities for injectables.It has partnered with generic drug manufacturer Civica Rx, chemical company Ampac Fine Chemicals and Virginia Commonwealth University’s Medicines for All Institute. It said it has already delivered over 1.6 million doses of five essential generic medicines to treat Covid-19 patients to the US Strategic National Stockpile. Edwards’ previous company Kaleo was criticized for high prices, including a $4,500 price tag on Evzio, its device to treat painkiller overdoses. Kaleo lowered the price for federal and state government agencies as well as patients without government or commercial insuranceA Phlow spokesman said Edwards never had any control over drug pricing during his tenure at Kaleo and is committed to providing low-cost generic drugs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-administration-signs-up-new-company-to-make-covid-19-drugs-in-us/story-lAKbBz1fFeNOqRILeyXUQO.html

Radisson hotels and food producer PRFoods are among the first companies that have started to test the passport.“We are seeking every solution to have our employees back to work and clients sleeping in our hotels again,” said Kaido Ojaperv, CEO of Radisson Blu Sky Hotel at Tallinn.Estonia, which has so far recorded 64 deaths due to COVID-19 and 1,791 infections, has started to ease the lockdown measures this month, and opened last week with Lithuania and Latvia the first “travel bubble” within the European Union.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/estonia-starts-testing-digital-immunity-passport-for-workplaces/story-vlMAVm2Ld0OcTLxh0MZiqJ.html
20-05-2020||World||Canada’s first: Teen INCEL who killed a woman charged with terrorism||Canadian law enforcement has levelled terrorism charges against a teenager who belonged the burgeoning INCEL, or involuntary celibate, movement and was allegedly involved in the murder of a woman in Toronto this February.This is a precedent setting action and the first time ever that a killing or violence related to INCELs has been formally described as terrorism. Experts believe that this action will help broaden the application of terrorism charges in other instance that are motived by ideology.The 17-year-old charged with terrorism has not been named since he is a minor. In a rampage on February 24, the youth allegedly murdered 24-year-old Ashley Noell Arzaga at the Crown Spa in the city, while also injuring two others. The charges laid against him now are defined as first-degree murder - terrorist activity and attempted murder.“Terrorism comes in many forms and it’s important to note that it is not restricted to any particular group, religion or ideology,” the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and Toronto Police said in a joint statement. They added that the attack was “inspired by the Ideologically Motivated Violent Extremist (IMVE) movement commonly known as INCEL”.Canadian national broadcaster CBC described the INCELs as a “misogynistic online movement” where participants “typically express frustration toward women over their own lack of sexual success, and sometimes threaten violence against them”.Violence related to INCELs has increased in recent years. In 2018, Alex Minassian, also inspired by INCEL, used his van to run over and kill 10 people. Sixteen others were injured in the incident.Minassian, 25, declared himself to be a soldier in the “INCEL” rebellion. He was charged with 10 counts of first-degree murder and 13 counts of attempted murder.Canadian authorities had said that the majority of the victims were women, ranging in age from their mid-20s to early 80s.The outlet Global News noted that such attacks have happened in Florida in November 2018 and Texas in June last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-s-first-teen-incel-who-killed-a-woman-charged-with-terrorism/story-ZuqyHhBIoyM4bQssw5KXAL.html

20-05-2020||World||South Korea restarts schools after coronavirus spread slows||After an unprecedented five-month break, South Korean students are returning to their classrooms as government health officials declared that the country may have avoided a “second wave” of infections.The schools are reopening in stages, with high school seniors returning first on Wednesday and middle and elementary students slated to go back to school in the following weeks. The third-year high school students are leading the return as they now only have half a year before their annual university entrance exams in early December, education officials said.Unlike in the US, South Korea’s academic year starts in March, but students never returned to school after their winter break as the Asian nation confirmed its first Covid-19 infection in late January and then saw a spike in cases -- peaking at near 1,000 a day -- in February. Resumption of schools were delayed five times, and in April, all students were offered online classes instead.Health and education officials had worried that a new cluster infections linked to nightclubs in Seoul earlier this month could once again jeopardize plans to reopen schools, but they concluded the latest outbreak appears under control.Big EffortSouth Korea has been able to sharply slow coronavirus infections by launching a massive testing and contact tracing campaign. Thirteen new cases were reported Tuesday, raising the total to 11,078.“There are still worries over safety of our students, but the situation of the community spread is within the capacity of our health care system,” Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun said before a meeting Tuesday. “If we, the government, school and families, act together, we could restart the off-line classes safely.”South Korea’s government left detailed academic schedules and methodology for each age group to be decided by respective regional authorities. But most students in Seoul -- representing more than 15% of all school-age children in the country -- will not go to school every day, except for those in their final academic year, according to the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education.Depending on the school district, schools will start on different days and students will alternate between attending classes and online instructions at home. Class times and lunch hours are also being staggered. No extracurricular activities will be allowed.Education officials said that a school would be shuttered immediately if an infection is confirmed among the school’s students, faculty and staff.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-restarts-schools-after-coronavirus-spread-slows/story-jNjGS91Zye8ZfoRkUIvTXP.html
20-05-2020||World||Taiwan’s Tsai Ing-wen riding high into second term as Trump fights China||This might be as good as it gets for Tsai Ing-wen.Tsai is riding high as she starts to her second term as Taiwan’s president Wednesday in Taipei. Besides a record approval rating and a so-far successful effort to contain the coronavirus outbreak, Tsai has benefited from an upswing of support from the US and its allies.The next four years could be more challenging for Tsai, 63, as the democratically ruled island finds itself at the center of an increasingly fraught relationship between its giant neighbor China and the US. Taiwan’s export-dependent economy also faces the risk of its first recession in more than a decade as overseas demand collapses.Tsai is slated to lay out her agenda for give a speech at 10 a.m. local time after an inauguration ceremony pared down to prevent another coronavirus surge. She’ll pledge to build core industries including 5G and other information and communication technologies, bio-technology, medicine, defense and renewable energy, the Taipei-based Liberty Times reported Wednesday, without saying where it got the information. She’s also expected to maintain her opposition to unification with China, stressing democracy and dialogue in dealing with Beijing.“Taiwan’s relationship with the US will continue to warm up as the US-China relationship continues to break down,” Stephen Tan, president of the Taipei-based Cross-Strait Policy Association, said via telephone. “As long as the US-China relationship remains tense, cross-strait ties won’t improve. All Taiwan can do, and Tsai is expected to do, is to avoid being provocative and changing the status quo, but also not giving in.”High PointThe event marks another historic high point for Tsai’s Democratic Progressive Party, which has grown over the past four decades from a loose band of pro-independence dissidents to become Taiwan’s dominant political bloc. A landslide election victory in January reaffirmed the DPP’s control of the executive and legislative branches and left the Kuomintang -- who ruled Taiwan for much of the time since the Chinese civil war ended in 1949 -- stuck in the opposition.Tsai begins her second term with an approval rating of 61%, the highest since she took office in May 2016, according to a survey by broadcaster TVBS released Monday.The DPP’s rise has upended efforts to by Chinese President Xi Jinping to use his country’s economic might to draw Taiwan toward a unification deal. Tsai, who views Taiwan as a sovereign nation, was expected to repeat her rejection of Xi’s bottom line that both sides belong to “one-China.”“Beijing has given up on hoping for demonstrations of ‘sincerity’ from Tsai -- partly because they set the bar too high and partly because they don’t believe she is sincere anyway,” said Jonathan Sullivan, director of China programs at the University of Nottingham. “None of the moderation that Tsai has shown has been good enough to negate the preordained opinion in Beijing that she is an independence wolf in status-quo sheep’s clothing.”In her first term, Tsai repeatedly benefited from Donald Trump’s feuding with China, holding an unprecedented phone call with the US president in December 2016 and securing Taiwan’s first American fighter jet deal in three decades. Tsai’s support for pro-democracy protests in the former British colony of Hong Kong last year helped her consolidate her China-skeptic base and secure re-election.The Trump administration threw its weigh behind an international campaign to grant Taiwan access to the World Health Assembly earlier this week. And while the attempt ultimately failed, it highlighted the lengths to which the US was willing to go to back a greater international role for Taiwan.Since Tsai came into office in 2016, Beijing has persuaded seven former Taiwanese allies to switch ties to the People’s Republic of China. Taiwan is now officially recognized by just 15 countries, mostly small states in Latin America and the Pacific. Tsai has also made little progress in securing a bilateral trade deal with the USUS Secretary of State Michael Pompeo congratulated Tsai in a statement Tuesday, saying America “has long considered Taiwan a force for good in the world and a reliable partner.” The two sides “have a shared vision for the region -- one that includes rule of law, transparency, prosperity and security for all,” he said.Higher StakesThe stakes for Tsai could rise in her second term, as disputes between Washington and Beijing prompt predictions that the two sides are headed toward a new cold war. While Tsai had so far avoided any moves that might prompt an aggressive response by Beijing, she may face greater demands from the DPP’s pro-independence wing after its recent electoral success.One figure to watch is Tsai’s incoming vice president, Lai Ching-te. Lai, a former premier who has described himself as an “independence worker,” is a much more outspoken advocate for a formal break from China than either Tsai or his predecessor, Vice President Chen Chien-jen.Tsai’s speech comes just two days before Chinese Premier Li Keqiang is scheduled to deliver his annual report to the National People’s Congress in Beijing, a platform that Chinese leaders have often used to deliver pointed message to Taiwan. Last year, Li vowed that China would “resolutely oppose and deter any separatist schemes or activities seeking Taiwanese independence.”“Beijing will continue to employ a mix of its carrots and sticks approach with Taiwan, but with an emphasis on the latter,” said Russell Hsiao, executive director of the Washington-based Global Taiwan Institute. “Indeed, most indicators point to China ratcheting up its multifaceted pressure campaign against Taiwan.”Although Taiwan has avoided a coronavirus outbreak like those in China or South Korea, Tsai faces many of the same economic concerns as Taiwan’s neighbors. Growth in the first quarter cooled to the slowest pace since 2016, an increasing number of economists forecast the economy’s first contraction since 2009.And Taiwan’s companies could also suffer collateral damage from Trump’s efforts to push back against Chinese influence, such as new US rules barring any chipmaker using American equipment from supplying Huawei Technologies Co. Taiwan’s biggest company, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., gets an estimated 14% of its revenue from Huawei.“In the next four years, Taiwan faces a variety of threats from China and some from the United States,” said Ashley Feng, a research associate with the Center for a New American Security. “Opportunities for China and Taiwan to cooperate over the next four years are limited and shrinking.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-s-tsai-ing-wen-riding-high-into-second-term-as-trump-fights-china/story-bTcGP8uue46tnN9a7tBJEP.html
20-05-2020||World||US extends heightened border enforcement during coronavirus||A Trump administration policy of quickly expelling most migrants stopped along the border because of the Covid-19 pandemic was indefinitely extended Tuesday, with a top US health official arguing that what had been a short-term order was still needed to protect the country from the virus.The order issued by Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, authorizes Customs and Border Protection to immediately remove migrants, including people seeking asylum, as a way to prevent the potential spread of the virus while in custody.President Donald Trump issued the initial 30-day order in March, and it was extended for another month in April. The new version notably has no fixed end date, though it says the CDC will review public health data every 30 days to ensure it is still necessary.Administration officials have defended the policy amid criticism from human rights advocates who say the US is using health as a pretext to deny people the right to seek asylum and to enact immigration policies aimed at appealing to supporters of the president in an election year.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“Trump’s goal is not to protect our health, it’s to sow division and advance his political agenda,” said Andrea Flores, deputy director of immigration policy for the American Civil Liberties Union.Under the policy, CBP has been sending Mexican and Central American migrants they encounter along the southwestern border back to Mexico in about two hours. It is turning people from other countries over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement for rapid repatriation, removing people who might have remained in the country for months, or even years, to pursue asylum claims.Human Rights First, a nonpartisan human rights organization, said the CDC order has already been used to block and expel thousands of asylum-seekers to dangerous places.“This new extension of the CDC order will end US refugee and child protections at the border indefinitely, endangering rather than saving lives,” said Eleanor Acer, the group’s senior director for refugee protection. “There is little doubt that the Trump administration will wield this indefinite ban to expel and block asylum-seekers and children for many months or longer, possibly until this administration is no longer in office.”The US is also quickly expelling migrants encountered entering across the northern border with Canada, though there are far fewer than along the southwest.Acting US Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf said in announcing the extension that the restrictions were one of the most critical tools his department has to “prevent the further spread of the virus and to protect the American people, DHS front-line officers, and those in their care and custody from Covid-19.”The previous order was due to expire Wednesday. Redfield said the new one would remain in effect until “the danger of further introduction of Covid-19 into the United States has ceased to be a serious danger to the public health.” He also noted that vaccines and treatment for the virus were still months away and that cases were increasing in the US, Canada and Mexico.Canada, Mexico and the US shut their borders by mutual agreement to nonessential traffic in March to help control the spread of the virus.Trump followed that up in April with an executive order that halted immigration to the US for 60 days in an effort to limit competition for jobs amid the economic collapse from the outbreak.The president has long advocated restrictions on both legal and illegal immigration and has raised concerns for years about foreigners competing with American citizens for jobs. But he denied he was using the virus to make good on a long-standing campaign promise during an election year.Also Tuesday, the Trump administration asked a federal appeals court to allow it to terminate an agreement that places limits on the detention of immigrant children.Justice Department lawyer August Flentje told a panel of the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals in California that “repeated border crises that are driven by irregular family migration” required the government to adopt new rules and replace what’s known as the Flores settlement.In court filings, lawyers for migrants said ending the agreement would give ICE new powers to detain children and parents indefinitely and “eviscerate their right to a neutral review of whether they are eligible for release.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-extends-heightened-border-enforcement-during-coronavirus/story-KTnAtkFKyvqBCPKuYA3oiO.html
20-05-2020||World||States accused of fudging or bungling Covid-19 testing data||As large parts of the US ease their lockdowns against the coronavirus, public health officials in some states are being accused of bungling infection statistics or even deliberately using a little sleight of hand to make things look better than they are.The result is that politicians, business owners and ordinary Americans who are making decisions about reopenings and other day-to-day matters risk being left with the impression that the virus is under more control than it actually is.In Virginia, Texas and Vermont, for example, officials said they have been combining the results of viral tests, which show an active infection, with antibody tests, which show a past infection. Public health experts say that can make for impressive-looking testing totals but does not give a true picture of how the virus is spreading.In Florida, the data scientist who developed the state’s coronavirus dashboard, Rebekah Jones, said this week that she was fired for refusing to manipulate data “to drum up support for the plan to reopen.” Calls to health officials for comment were not immediately returned Tuesday.In Georgia, one of the earliest states to ease up on lockdowns and assure the public it was safe to go out again, the Department of Public Health published a graph around May 11 that purportedly showed new COVID-19 cases declining over time in the most severely affected counties. The entries, however, were not arranged in chronological order but in descending order.Georgia state Rep. Jasmine Clark, a Democrat with a doctorate in microbiology, called the graph a “prime example of malfeasance,” adding: “Science matters, and data manipulation is not only dangerous, but leads to distrust in our institutions.” Democratic state Rep. Scott Holcomb likewise called the department’s presentations “purposely misleading.” Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp’s office denied there was any attempt to deceive the public.Guidelines from the Trump administration say that before states begin reopening, they should see a 14-day downward trend in infections. However, some states have reopened when infections were still climbing or had plateaued. States have also been instructed to expand testing and contact tracing.The US has recorded 1.5 million confirmed infections and over 90,000 deaths.Vermont and Virginia said they stopped combining the two types of tests in the past few days. Still, health officials in Virginia, where Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam has eased up on restrictions, said that combining the numbers caused “no difference in overall trends.” In Texas, where health officials said last week that they were including some antibody results in their testing totals and case counts, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott said Monday that the numbers are not being commingled. Health officials did not respond to requests for clarification.Georgia’s Department of Public Health also regularly publishes a graph that shows cases over time, except new infections are not listed on the day they came back positive, which is the practice in many other states. Instead, Georgia lists new cases on the day the patient first reported symptoms.That practice can shift the timeline of the outbreak and make it appear as if the state is moving past the peak.Kemp spokesperson Candice Broce insisted that the governor’s office is not telling the department what to do and that officials are not trying to dress up data to make Kemp look better, saying that “could not be further from the truth.” As for the May 11 graph, Broce said public health officials were trying to highlight which days had seen the highest peaks of infections. “It was not intended to mislead,” Broce said Tuesday. “It was always intended to be helpful.” Thomas Tsai, a professor at the Harvard Global Health Institute, said the way Georgia reports data makes it harder to understand what the current conditions are, and he worries that other states may also be presenting data in a way that doesn’t capture the most up-to-date information.In other developments, the White House scrambled to defend President Donald Trump’s decision to use the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine to fend off the coronavirus. The drug is unproven against the virus, and the president’s move spurred fears that many Americans might start using the medication, which carries potentially fatal side effects.White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany emphasized that “any use of hydroxychloroquine has to be in consultation with your doctor.” More than 4.8 million people worldwide have been confirmed infected by the virus, and about 320,000 deaths have been recorded, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University that experts believe is too low.

20-05-2020||World||26 scientists among 150 Indians returning home from S Africa this week||Twenty-six Indian scientists stranded in South Africa’s Cape Town due to a coronavirus lockdown will be heading back home this week. They had been on a mission to Antarctica and stuck in South Africa three months ago after the imposition of the lockdown. The scientists are among around 150 Indian nationals who will be returning home on a South African Airways (SAA) flight that will leave Johannesburg on Friday for Mumbai and Delhi.Indian Consul General in Johannesburg, Anju Ranjan, said over 1,000 Indian nationals had registered for the the flight. Passengers had to be vetted by the Indian mission based on a criteria set by the South African Department of Home Affairs. “We had to select priority passengers depending on their need,” Ranjan said in a Facebook broadcast. The diplomat said those left out are likely to be repatriated on an Air India flight under the Indian government’s Vande Bharat mission. “People who are going back on this flight include 26 scientists from India who were stuck in Cape Town after they returned from a mission to Antarctica,” Ranjan said. “They were here for the past three months, so this was a priority for us to send them back to India,” the official said. Ranjan said 93 members of the ISE Cruise who were stuck in the coastal city of Durban were also a priority for them. Others approved for the flight are those who are ill or on a temporary tourist visa. Ranjan said the ticket price for the one-way flight was 15,000 rands, which was fixed by the SAA and the Indian government had nothing to do with it. The fare, which is almost thrice the normal ticket price, has to be paid by the passengers themselves. An Air India flight can be expected in phase 3 of the Vande Bharat mission in June as there is no fixed date for it yet, Ranjan said. Currently, the mission in phase 2, the official added. “Many people who could not pay could not be accommodated on the flight. I feel very sorry for them, but we can have some say and discounts when we get our own flights, so I just want them to wait patiently and not feel disheartened,” Ranjan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/26-scientists-among-150-indians-returning-home-from-s-africa-this-week/story-1a9OygHi9VQZYBtVouFwBM.html
20-05-2020||World||US births fall, and Covid-19 could drive them down more||US births continued to fall last year, leading to the fewest number of newborns in 35 years.The decline is the latest sign of a prolonged national “baby bust” that’s been going on for more than a decade. And some experts believe the coronavirus pandemic and its impact on the economy will suppress the numbers further.“This unpredictable environment, and anxiety about the future, is going to make women think twice about having children,” said Dr Denise Jamieson, chair of obstetrics and gynaecology at Emory University.The latest numbers were released Wednesday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The report, which is considered preliminary, is based on a review of more than 99% of birth certificates issued last year.The CDC found the number of births fell about 1% from 2018, to about 3.7 million. Birth rates continued to fall for teen moms and for women in their 20s.Aside from a one-year uptick in 2014, US births have been falling every year since 2007, when a recession hit the country. The drop continued even after the economy rebounded.Experts say there are a number of causes, but chief among them are shifting attitudes about motherhood: Many women and couples delay childbearing and have fewer kids once they start. The economy is a factor, but not because of short-term cycles in hiring. Many jobs are low-paying and unstable, and that coupled with high rents and other factors have caused women and couples to be much more cautious about having kids, said John Santelli, a Columbia University professor of population and family health.It’s unclear what will happen to births this year, said Brady Hamilton, the CDC report’s lead author. The impact of the last few months’ events won’t become clear in maternity wards until late this year or early next, he said.Santelli said it’s possible births will go up, at least among some groups. Access to birth control and abortion has become more difficult, and some homebound couples may find themselves with greater opportunity to conceive, he said.But others say it’s more likely births will plummet.The idea that there will be a lot of “coronababies” is “widely is widely perceived as a myth,” said Hans-Peter Kohler, a University of Pennsylvania fertility researcher.The debate most demographers are having is not about whether there will be a decline, but whether it will be lasting, he said.“The decline due to COVID-19 might be different given the extent and severity of the crisis, and the long-lasting uncertainty that is caused by it,” Kohler wrote in an email.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-births-fall-and-covid-19-could-drive-them-down-more/story-rVZM818pTy5O7m3NITDQUJ.html
20-05-2020||World||Trump’s use of malaria drug likely to be welcomed in India||President Donald Trump’s declaration that he was taking a malaria drug of dubious effectiveness to help fend off the coronavirus will likely be welcomed in India.Trump’s previous endorsement of hydroxychloroquine catalyzed a tremendous shift in the South Asian country, spurring the world’s largest producer of the drug to make much more of it, prescribe it for front-line health workers treating the virus and deploy it as a diplomatic tool, despite mounting evidence against using the drug for Covid-19.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageTrump said Monday that he was taking hydroxychloroquine as a measure of protection against the virus. The US Food and Drug Administration, however, has cautioned against using it outside of hospitals because of the risk of serious heart problems.Suhhil Gupta, a pharmacist in New Delhi, said Tuesday that Trump’s announcement shouldn’t carry any weight in India.“He’s not a pharmacist. His statements are not relevant to the field,” Gupta said.Still, India’s policy on the decades-old drug, used to prevent malaria and treat lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, drastically changed after Trump tweeted in March that the drug, used together with an antibiotic, could be “game changers” in the fight against the pandemic. India’s health ministry quickly approved it as a prophylactic for health care workers and others at high risk of infection, and as a treatment for critically ill patients.Officials in Mumbai even drew up a plan to administer hydroxychloroquine to thousands of slum dwellers as a preventive measure against the virus.Indian health officials have declined repeated requests for comment, limiting communications to daily health briefings, the last of which occurred May 11.The rules say that drugs such as hydroxychloroquine be used only after a rigorous scientific and ethical review, continued oversight by an ethics committee and ensuring informed consent — none of which happened with hydroxychloroquine, according to Dr. Amar Jesani, a medical ethics expert.The Mumbai proposal was ultimately shelved amid questions of the ethics of administering the malaria drug without first subjecting it to clinical trials. Still, the Indian government has recommended more and more people use it, contravening 2017 rules for emergency use of untested drugs, Jesani said.India initially banned hydroxychloroquine exports, but lifted the ban after Trump threatened “retaliation.” At the same time, India’s government ordered manufacturers to ramp up production from 1.2 million to 3 million pills a month — causing company shares to skyrocket. From the US to Australia, sales jumped.Officials have even said that Indian plantations could increase the growing capacity of cinchona trees, whose bark contains the compound quinine, which has been used to treat malaria since the 1860s. Quinine can also be made synthetically.The Indian government itself purchased 100 million hydroxychloroquine pills, according to government data, to distribute to states and donate to countries including Afghanistan, Myanmar and the Dominican Republic.India is the world’s largest producer of generic drugs, a fast-growing industry that has brought down pharmaceutical prices globally. During the HIV/AIDs crisis, India played a similar role as in the coronavirus pandemic, boosting global supplies of life-saving drugs.The problem this time, experts say, is that the hydroxychloroquine hype is based on a flimsy study, with little to no evidence that it prevents or treats Covid-19.Still, a sharp rise in demand has reduced supplies for patients with lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.India’s hurried guidance has also impeded scientific trials that could determine whether the benefits of taking hydroxychloroquine outweigh the risks.“We should do a trial. I think that is the right way to come to answer on this question. But the (government) made our job harder,” said Dr. Bharath Kumar, whose team has proposed a trial.Meanwhile, evidence against using hydroxychloroquine for the coronavirus is growing.A US study of 368 patients in veterans’ hospitals, the largest study yet examining the malaria drug’s value as a coronavirus antidote, found no benefits and even more deaths among those given the drug.The Indian government’s own assessment of 19 drugs found that hydroxychloroquine wasn’t the most promising. A task force noted that while hydroxychloroquine was readily available, the strength of scientific evidence for the mechanism of action was fairly low.With more than 101,000 cases and 3,163 deaths, the coronavirus hasn’t yet overwhelmed India’s limited health care system. But that’s starting to change in some hot spots as a stringent weeks-long nationwide lockdown begins to ease, allowing for greater mobility of the country’s 1.3 billion people.Nowhere is this clearer than in Maharashtra, the coastal state in central India bearing a third of India’s virus caseload. The state’s medical education and research agency has been administering hydroxychloroquine to patients in public hospitals and clinics, according to court records.Agency chief Dr. Tatyarao P. Lahane said protocols set by India’s government were being followed and declined to answer further questions.Dr. Shriprakash Kalantri of the Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences in Maharashtra said the government was recommending hydroxychloroquine for “off label,” or unapproved, use, meaning that patients must be told that “there is a small but significant risk that it might harm you.”“If there is no evidence backed by solid clinical trials, then why are the scientific bodies pushing this drug and giving an impression to the public that this is a magic bullet and this is your last hope?” Kalantri said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-s-use-of-malaria-drug-likely-to-be-welcomed-in-india/story-wuNFZxYeHLEp6DTIKeA61L.html
20-05-2020||World||Australia to relax some domestic travel curbs amid Covid-19 pandemic||Australians in the country’s most populous state will be able to vacation within its borders next month, when art galleries and museums will also reopen, as officials seek to boost an economy hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic.The move will allow New South Wales state, home to Sydney, to open up tourist regions on its southern coast that were badly damaged by huge bushfires before the virus wreaked further havoc.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageNSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said people would still need to adapt to a “new normal” as officials maintain some of the social distancing measures that have been credited with keeping both Covid-19 cases and deaths relatively low.“We want people to enjoy themselves, to feel free, but at the same time please know that nothing we do is the same during a pandemic,” she said during a televised media conference.“We want to people to feel encouraged and hopeful about the future, but we also want people to be realistic, in that a Covid-safe environment will look and feel very different to what it did before the pandemic.”Australia has reported just over 7,000 infections, including 100 deaths, among its population of 25 million.NSW, the hardest hit state, logged just four new cases over the past 24 hours, all international travellers already in quarantine. More than 7,000 test results over the same period showed no community transmission, Berejiklian said.Australia’s states and territories are implementing a three-step federal government plan to unwind lockdown measures at a staggered pace, meaning different areas of the country have different restrictions.In Victoria state, authorities were using a controversial smartphone contact tracing app for the first time to track the movements of a person who was confirmed on Monday to have the disease.Almost 6 million Australians have downloaded the app, still short of the 40% of the population the government has said would make it an effective tool, amid privacy concerns about the use of the data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-to-relax-some-domestic-travel-curbs-amid-covid-19-pandemic/story-cgzRdJ63F2Lzm4nldWV34N.html
20-05-2020||World||‘My decision to make’: Trump defends criticised use of antimalarial drug HCQ for Covid-19||President Donald Trump emphatically defended himself Tuesday against criticism from medical experts that his announced use of a malaria drug against the coronavirus could spark wide misuse by Americans of the unproven treatment with potentially fatal side effects.Trump’s revelation a day earlier that he was taking hydroxychloroquine caught many in his administration by surprise and set off an urgent effort by officials to justify his action. But their attempt to address the concerns of health professionals was undercut by the president himself.He asserted without evidence that a study of veterans raising alarm about the drug was “false” and an “enemy statement,” even as his own government warned that the drug should be administered for COVID-19 only in a hospital or research setting.“If you look at the one survey, the only bad survey, they were giving it to people that were in very bad shape,” Trump said. That was an apparent reference to a study of hundreds of patients treated by the Department of Veterans Affairs in which more of those in a group who were administered hydroxychloroquine died than among those who weren’t.“They were very old. Almost dead,” Trump said. “It was a Trump enemy statement.” During a Cabinet meeting, he elicited a defense of his practice from other officials, including VA Secretary Robert Wilkie who noted that the study in question was not conducted by his agency.But the drug has not been shown to combat the virus in a multitude of other studies as well. Two large observational studies, each involving around 1,400 patients in New York, recently found no COVID benefit from hydroxychloroquine. Two new ones published last week in the medical journal BMJ reached the same conclusion.No large, rigorous studies have found the drug safe or effective for preventing or treating COVID-19.Trump said he decided to take hydroxychloroquine after two White House staffers tested positive for the disease, but he already had spent months promoting the drug as a potential cure or preventive despite the cautionary advice of many of his administration’s top medical professionals.“This is an individual decision to make,” Trump told reporters during a visit to Capitol Hill to meet with Senate Republicans. He later claimed, “It’s gotten a bad reputation only because I’m promoting it.”Many studies are testing hydroxychloroquine for preventing or limiting coronavirus illness but “at this point in time there’s absolutely no evidence that this strategy works,” said Dr. Carlos del Rio, an infectious-disease specialist at Emory University in Atlanta.“My concern is, the president has a big bully pulpit ... maybe people will think there’s some non-public evidence” that the drug works because Trump has chosen to use it, del Rio said. “It creates this conspiracy theory that something works and they’re not telling me about it yet.”The veterans study that Trump slammed was an analysis by researchers at several universities of hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin in COVID-19 patients at veterans hospitals across the nation. It found no benefit and more deaths among those given hydroxychloroquine versus standard care alone. The work was posted on an online site for researchers and has not been reviewed by other scientists. Grants from the National Institutes of Health and the University of Virginia paid for the work.Addressing concerns that Trump’s example could lead people to misuse the drug, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said that “tens of millions of people around the world have used this drug for other purposes,” including malaria prophylaxis. She emphasized, “You have to have a prescription. That’s the way it must be done.”The drug is also prescribed for some lupus and arthritis patients.Trump said his doctor did not recommend hydroxychloroquine to him, but that he requested it from the White House physician.That physician, Dr. Sean Conley, said in a statement that, after “numerous discussions” with Trump, “we concluded the potential benefit from treatment outweighed the relative risks.”The Food and Drug Administration warned health professionals last month that the drug should not be used to treat COVID-19 outside hospital or research settings because of sometimes-fatal side effects. Regulators issued the alert, in part, based on increased reports of dangerous side effects called in to U.S. poison control centers.Calls to centers involving hydroxychloroquine increased last month to 96, compared with 49 in April 2019, according to data from the American Association of Poison Control Centers provided to the AP. It was the second month of elevated reports involving the drug, following 79 calls in March. The problems reported included abnormal heart rhythms, seizures, nausea and vomiting.Trump dismissed reports of side effects, claiming, “What has been determined is it doesn’t harm you. Very powerful drug, I guess, but it doesn’t harm you.”He added, “I’ve had no impact from it.”FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn said in an emailed statement Tuesday: “The decision to take any drug is ultimately a decision between a patient and their doctor.”As research started to emerge that hydroxychloroquine was not helpful, and even potentially harmful, in battling COVID-19, the president’s public rhetoric in support of the drug had faded. But his private hopes had not, according to three White House officials and Republicans close to the White House not authorized to speak publicly about private discussions.Trump also lashed out at House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, calling her a “sick woman” who has “a lot of mental problems” after she questioned Trump’s use of the drug because he is 73 and falsely labeled him “morbidly obese.” Her comments were followed by Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, who told MSNBC that Trump’s move was “reckless, reckless, reckless.“Trump’s presumptive Democratic opponent in the 2020 election, Joe Biden, chastised the president for being irresponsible in taking hydroxychloroquine.“What is he doing? What in God’s name is he doing?” Biden said during a Yahoo News town hall Tuesday night. “The words of a president matter.”After two staffers were known to test positive for COVID-19 earlier this month, the White House mandated that those in the West Wing wear face coverings and introduced daily testing for the president, vice president and those they come in close contact with.Pence told Fox on Tuesday that he was not taking the drug because his doctor did not recommend it, but said he “would never begrudge any American taking the advice of their physician.”Prescriptions for hydroxychloroquine surged roughly 80% in March to more than 830,000 compared with same period in the prior year, according to data tracking firm IQVIA. That jump in prescribing came before the federal government accepted nearly 30 million doses of the drug donated to the strategic national stockpile by foreign drugmakers. Since then, millions of those tablets have been shipped to U.S. hospitals nationwide for use treating patients with COVID-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/my-decision-to-make-trump-defends-criticised-use-of-antimalarial-drug-hcq-for-covid-19/story-pyu1HreuneonwKZPkUfa7N.html
20-05-2020||World||‘This is war’: Virus charges beyond Latin American hotspots||Beyond the hotspots of Brazil and Mexico, the coronavirus is threatening to overwhelm Latin American cities stretching from Chile to the Colombian Amazon in an alarming sign that the pandemic may be only at the start of its destructive march through the region.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage More than 90% of intensive care beds were full last week in Chile’s capital, Santiago, whose main cemetery dug 1,000 emergency graves to prepare for a wave of deaths.In Lima, Peru, patients took up 80% of intensive care beds as of Friday. Peru has the world’s 12th-highest number of confirmed cases, with more than 90,000.“We’re in bad shape,” said Pilar Mazzetti, head of the Peruvian government’s Covid-19 task force. “This is war.” In some cities, doctors say patients are dying because of a lack of ventilators or because they couldn’t get to a hospital fast enough. With intensive care units swamped, officials plan to move patients from capitals like Lima and Santiago to hospitals in smaller cities that aren’t as busy — running the risk of spreading the disease further.Latin American countries halted international flights and rolled out social distancing guidelines around the same time as the US and Europe, delaying the arrival of large-scale infection, said Dr Marcos Espinal, director of communicable diseases at the Pan American Health Organization.“Latin America was the last wave,” said Espinal, who previously worked at the World Health Organization.He warned that authorities need to maintain anti-virus restrictions even as the US and Europe reopen. Some of the hardest-hit cities, like Lima and Santiago, imposed strict, early lockdowns.But officials have struggled to enforce them, whether among the wealthy who are used to flouting regulations or lower-income people who depend on day labor or selling things on the street to feed their families.Latin America is the world’s most unequal region, a reality that Espinal said made it difficult to balance health and economic growth, with millions facing increased poverty during quarantines, curfews and shutdowns.A month after swamping the Ecuadorian coastal city of Guayaquil in one of the first serious blows to Latin America, Covid-19 is sickening thousands in the capital of Quito, where 80% of intensive care beds were occupied as of Friday.“In terms of intensive care, we’re stripped bare,” city health secretary Lenín Mantilla said.Quito has more than 2,400 confirmed infections, and Health Minister Juan Carlos Zevallos said he expected the peak to come toward the end of June. He assured citizens that the city was prepared and would avoid the fate of Guayaquil, where hundreds died at home, left in living rooms for days before overworked coroners could retrieve the bodies. Those who perished in hospitals in coastal cities were put in chilled shipping containers that served as makeshift morgues.The number of deaths in Quito jumped alarmingly over the weekend, from 114 to 209, and doctors said they dreaded the coming days.“I have a 26-year-old woman next to me who walked in. Three hours later, she’s suffocating because we don’t have a respirator available,’‘ said an intensive care doctor, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not allowed to speak to the media. “I think we’re getting to the point that you saw in Europe, where people died for lack of respirators.” Ecuador has banned most private car trips and imposed a 2 pm to 5 am daily quarantine, but thousands of people can be seen buying from street vendors across the capital.The worst-hit country in Latin America remains Brazil, which is third in the world for reported infections — at more than 250,000 — even with limited testing. More than 85 percent of intensive care beds are full in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo.Now, other countries are surging. Chile has imposed new restrictions in Santiago after cases doubled over the past week, to more than 34,000 in the country of 18 million people.Under the new restrictions, people will have to receive a police permit to leave home, with violators fined the equivalent of thousands of dollars. Essential workers are exempted.“We’re on very, very thin ice,” said Claudio Castillo, a professor of public policy and health at the University of Santiago.In Colombia’s Amazon region, cases have shot up in recent weeks, from 105 at the start of the month to 1,006 on Monday. The infections are concentrated in Leticia, a city on the Amazon river that borders both Brazil and Peru.Locals believe it’s related to the increase in cases in Brazil’s Amazon. Even though Colombia’s president has militarised the border, many still cross. Residents often work in one country and live in the other.Leticia relies on two poorly equipped hospitals, which have about a half-dozen respirators between them. Authorities recently began transporting seriously ill patients to Bogota after a failure at a hospital oxygen plant. Officials said Monday that they will open hotels in Leticia to take in people with less severe coronavirus cases.Health workers also complain of limited access to testing and say they are overworked to the point of collapse.In Mexico, intensive care occupancy is below 50 per cent in most cities, although deaths have begun to overwhelm funeral homes and crematoriums in the Mexico City borough of Iztapalapa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/this-is-war-virus-charges-beyond-latin-american-hotspots/story-UEDfT0IQySAAJb8HPUnd7M.html

Underlining Washington’s escalating fight with Beijing, Trump said the WHO needs to show “independence from China”. He earlier labelled the WHO as a “puppet of China”.In a letter to WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Trump accused the organisation of “repeated missteps” in responding to the pandemic.Trump shared the letter on Twitter hours after Chinese President Xi Jinping addressed the WHO’s governing body, the World Health Assembly, by video link. Xi promised to devote $2 billion towards fighting the pandemic over the next two years.WHO head Tedros later said that he would keep leading the global fight against the pandemic.Commenting on Trump’s letter, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said it was “full of insinuations” and aimed “to mislead the public and achieve the purpose of stigmatising China’s epidemic control efforts while shirking its own responsibility”. He said the US has an obligation to pay the full WHO membership fee.“Arbitrarily cutting funding to an international organisation is unilateralist behaviour,” Zhao said. “We urge the US to stop passing the buck and deepen international cooperation.”In the letter, Trump wrote, “It is clear repeated missteps by you and your organisation in responding to the pandemic have been extremely costly for the world. The only way forward for the organisation is if it can actually demonstrate independence from China.”He also wrote that if the WHO “does not commit to major substantive improvements within the next 30 days, I will make my temporary freeze on US funding permanent and reconsider our membership.”Later, when Trump was asked about the reforms he wants the WHO to carry out, he said, “They have to clean up their act. They have to do a better job. They have to be much more fair to other countries, including the US, or we are not going to b involved with them any more and we will go our separate way.”The US president had suspended US funding for the WHO - at more than $400 million annually - in April.The US has exited a number of world bodies and pacts during Trump’s tenure, starting with the Trans-Pacific Partnership in 2017. It was followed by departures from Paris Accord, Unesco, Iran Nuclear Deal and UNHCR.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-shoots-letter-to-who-threatens-to-exit-world-body/story-pSIypEPoIScSOUHKydBQNM.html

The pandemic has killed at least 17,971 people in Brazil, according to the Health Ministry.Brazil overtook Britain on Monday to become the country with the third-highest number of confirmed infections, behind Russia and the United States. Brazil’s confirmed cases also jumped by a record 17,408 on Tuesday, for a total of 271,628 people who have tested positive for the virus.Bolsonaro, an ideological ally of Trump, has been criticized for his handling of the outbreak, such as opposition to restrictions on movement he sees as too damaging to the economy.Bolsonaro said Interim Health Minister Eduardo Pazuello would issue new guidelines on Wednesday expanding the recommended use of the anti-malarial drug chloroquine to treat the coronavirus.Two trained doctors have resigned as Health Minister in the past month as Bolsonaro defies public health expert advice.Bolsonaro told website Blog do Magno that Pazuello, an active-duty army general, would sign the new chloroquine guidelines and keep the top job for now. Bolsonaro added that his mother is 93 years old, and he keeps a box of chloroquine on hand should she need it.Trump, who announced on Monday he was taking chloroquine preventively, told reporters on Tuesday: “I don’t want people coming over here and infecting our people. I don’t want people over there sick either. We’re helping Brazil with ventilators ... Brazil is having some trouble, no question about it.”Pan American Health Organization officials said in a virtual briefing they were concerned about the virus’ spread in the tri-border area of the Amazon between Colombia, Peru and Brazil. They urged special measures to protect vulnerable populations among the indigenous, poor and racial minorities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-1-179-brazil-registers-highest-one-day-highest-one-day-covid-19-deaths/story-LxDwV1r6NzH2nxpPxdom7J.html
20-05-2020||World||H-1B visa holders do not adversely affect US workers: Report||H-1B visa holders do not adversely affect US workers, a new research said on Tuesday, suggesting that the presence of the workforce holding such visas boosts employment among other workers in an occupation.The National Foundation for American Policy said that the findings of its new research should give pause to policymakers considering imposing additional restrictions on the H-1B program. There is little reason to think doing so will help American workers, it said in its latest research.“H-1B visa holders do not adversely affect US workers, according to new research. On the contrary, the evidence points to the presence of H-1B visa holders being associated with lower unemployment rates and faster earnings growth among college graduates, including recent college graduates,” the report said.“Further, the results suggest that, if anything, being in a field with more H-1B visa holders makes it more likely that US-born young college graduates work in a job closely related to their college major,” it said.The study uses data from 2005 to 2018 to examine how the number of approved petitions to hire H-1B visa holders as a share of college graduates within each of 22 occupations affects the unemployment rate and earnings growth rate in those occupations.An increase in the share of workers with an H-1B visa within an occupation, on average, reduces the unemployment rate in that occupation, the report said. The results indicate that a 1 percentage point increase in the share of workers with an H-1B visa in an occupation reduces the unemployment rate by about 0.2 percentage points.The findings suggest the presence of H-1B visa holders boosts employment among other workers in an occupation. The results provide no evidence that the H-1B program has an adverse impact on labour market opportunities for US workers, it added.According to the report, while critics often allege that H-1B visas reduce wages or suppress wage growth, this finding on the opposite is consistent with research showing that H-1B visa holders earn at least as much as similar US workers, if not more.The results further indicate H-1B visa holders do not adversely affect US-born college graduates during the early years of their careers. Having more approved total or initial H-1B petitions, on average, reduces the unemployment rate within a major-occupation for recent graduates.It provides no evidence that recent college graduates have worse labour market outcomes if there are more H-1B visa holders in jobs closely related to their college major, the report said.Noting that the results of the research indicate that H-1B visa holders do not adversely affect US workers, the report said that the H-1B program is small relative to the size of the college-graduate workforce, likely accounting for at most two per cent of highly educated US workers.H-1B visa holders are concentrated in computer-related occupations but account for only a small share of workers in information technology (IT) jobs. Despite the H-1B program’s small scale, the visa category is important to the US economy and to employers that use it to fill gaps in their workforce.The presence of H-1B visa holders increases innovation, productivity and profits at H-1B employers and boosts total productivity and innovation in the United States.

The Schantzes tossed the bags in the back of their pickup truck and kept riding, according to Emily Schantz. Only when the Schantzes returned home did they discover the bags contained money, she said.“Inside of the bag, there were plastic baggies and they were addressed with something that said ‘cash vault,’” Schantz told WTVR.They contacted the Caroline County Sheriff’s Office, which sent deputies to the home. The deputies took inventory and determined the money totalled nearly USD 1 million.Caroline Sheriff’s Maj. Scott Moser said authorities have since determined where the money was headed, but are still trying to figure out how it ended up in the middle of a road in Goochland County. Moser would not say specifically where the money was going. But he said he hopes the recipients offer the Schantzes a nice reward.“Their actions deserve nothing less,” Moser said. “They saved someone a lot of money and set a wonderful example for everyone else.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/family-in-us-goes-out-for-a-drive-find-nearly-1-million-in-road/story-dYAFcxgt39j2kkyOveS1qL.html
20-05-2020||World||Covid-19: Cambridge teaching to go online next academic year||There will be no face-to-face lectures in the University of Cambridge in the next academic year beginning October 6 as part of plans to deal with coronavirus pandemic that has left British universities reeling with financial and other challenges.Teaching in the current Easter term in Cambridge was moved to online in April, but university authorities have now decided to continue to teach and hold exams online in 2020-21. If the official advice changes, it may be possible to hold some small teaching groups in person.Cambridge is among several universities bracing for lesser number of Indian and other non-EU international students turning up when the next academic year begins in September-October. The university sector has sought a bailout from the government.A Cambridge spokesman said: “The university is constantly adapting to changing advice as it emerges during this pandemic. Given that it is likely that social distancing will continue to be required, the university has decided there will be no face-to-face lectures during the next academic year”.“Lectures will continue to be made available online and it may be possible to host smaller teaching groups in person, as long as this conforms to social-distancing requirements. This decision has been taken now to facilitate planning, but as ever, will be reviewed should there be changes to official advice on coronavirus.”Universities moving to a virtual learning environment will deprive students of “campus experience”, which is one of the key attractions of international students to come to the UK. Stake-holders say it should be made clear to students how they would be taught before they arrive for the next academic year.In April, five unions warned the government that universities must be given extra protection during the pandemic to ensure their financial survival; some universities were already facing major financial challenges before the pandemic struck.Until recently, ministers, diplomats and stake-holders were hailing an increase in the number of Indian students based on visas granted, but there are now concerns over the extent of the new intake from September-October.In a joint letter to higher education minister Michelle Donelan, the unions representing higher education staff sought urgent assurances that universities will not be allowed to collapse financially as a result of the outbreak, backed up with legislation.The unions – UNISON, University and College Union (UCU), GMB, Unite and the Educational Institute of Scotland – said in a letter to the government that the university sector is too valuable for any institutions to get into financial difficulties.The letter says: “The university sector is one of the most productive and important parts of the UK economy with international students alone bringing in £7.3 billion each year and the sector as a whole generating £73 billion”.“We are already getting many reports of universities serving notifications of redundancies, and of contractors in universities sending staff home without pay or asking them to use their annual leave”.“It is no overstatement to say that such a response from universities will be disastrous for the individuals concerned and their families as well as for the future of the higher education sector – one of the most important industries in the UK”, it adds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-cambridge-teaching-to-go-online-next-academic-year/story-l6NeXSndIRHf6wGIe6InJN.html
20-05-2020||World||Canada, US extend border closure to non-essential travel||Canada and the US have agreed to extend their agreement to keep border closed to non-essential travel to June 21 during the coronavirus pandemic.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Tuesday the border is a source of vulnerability, so the agreement will be extended by another 30 days. The restrictions were announced on March 18 and were extended in April.Trudeau said Canada’s provincial leaders clearly wanted to continue the measures.“This will keep people in both of our countries safe.” Trudeau said.U.S. President Donald Trump also confirmed the extension, but looked forward to its eventual end, saying, “everything we want to get back to normal.”But many Canadians fear a reopening. The U.S. has more confirmed cases and deaths from COVID-19 than any country in the world, though its per capita numbers are well below many other nations.Essential cross-border workers like healthcare professionals, airline crews and truck drivers are still permitted to cross. Truck drivers are critical as they move food and medical goods in both directions. Much of Canada’s food supply comes from or via the U.S.Americans who are returning to America and Canadians who are returning to Canada are also exempted from the border closure.Canada sends 75% of its exports to the U.S. and about 18% of American exports go to Canada. The U.S. Canada border is world’s longest between two nations.___AP writer Darlene Superville in Washington contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-us-extend-border-closure-to-non-essential-travel/story-0lHh6Pizph9zoTtfsqm3jO.html

What’s common among them? Like many people around the world these days, all of them are wearing masks! They have emerged as a symbol of this era, giving out the message that we won’t give up till we defeat our enemy. Even the gigantic dinosaur at Ripley’s Believe It Or Not, in Los Angeles, US, manages to smile behind his face mask! A few toys, books and music stores have reopened with curb side pickup.As the entire globe tries to curb the spread of coronavirus, masks have also been appearing on public artworks in countries across the world. While a few months ago, wearing a mask in public would have been a fashion no-no, they are now a necessary mechanism to fight the virus, and thus a valid accessory that brands are busy prettying up.Everyone seems to be getting increasingly comfortable with the idea of wearing masks. At the Erawan shrine in Bangkok, Thai dancer have been wearing face shields while performing. Brazilian fashion photographer Marcio Rodrigues wore a mask made with recyclable bottles, cans and boxes in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, while dancers at Shanghai Ballet Company are also training with their masks on during the coronavirus epidemic.Wearing the masks on, even the common people feel like warriors, ready to do their bit in this fight against an invisible yet deadly enemy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/smiling-behind-the-mask-facial-covering-symbolise-our-relentless-fight-against-covid-19/story-AQ4mE4yP9MzNaWTrRx6x4O.html
20-05-2020||India||Don’t want buses? Will take them back: Priyanka to UP govt||Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said on Wednesday that the party would summon back the hundreds of buses it had sent to Utfar Pradesh’s borders to carry stranded migrant workers home after a confrontation with the state government, which refused to accept the vehicles .“If you don’t want to use them, it doesn’t matter. We will send them back,” Priyanka Gandhi said in a message posted on social media after repeated appeals to allow the buses, parked on UP’s borders with Delhi and Rajasthan, failed to move the Yogi Adityanath government.She said her party had arranged the buses in a humanitarian gesture to UP migrants stranded by the lockdown imposed in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic. “It doesn’t matter whether these are our buses or yours. We only wanted to help to serve the people,” the Congress general secretary said in the 10-minute messageUttar Pradesh deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma said earlier Wednesday that a list of buses sent to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) state government by the Congress was fake and alleged that many were unfit for use as public transport.“How can we take theses private buses mentioned in the Congress list? It’s fake, 460 on the list do not have requisite fitness. How can we deploy them? The state government cannot play with the lives of migrant labourers by using unfit buses. The state government is duty-bound to ensure a safe journey to the migrant workers,” Sharma said.The Congress claimed that 900 buses the party had dispatched to UP’s borders with Delhi and Rajasthan had been stranded there for 24 hours.“I want to request the chief minister -- our buses are there on the borders till 4pm. Do permit us to run these buses to help the migrants,” Priyanka Gandhi said. “We will complete 24 hours at 4pm. Use them, if you want to. If you want to put on BJP flags or BJP stickers on them, do so. If you want to claim these are your buses, do so. But allow these buses to run,” she said.She said the time wasted in pointing the alleged flaws in the Congress list could have been used in transporting migrant workers instead.“I want to say that on May 16-17, we made 500 buses available on the Ghaziabad borders. If these buses had been allowed to run, about 20,000 persons could have reached their homes. On Tuesday, we provided 900 buses. These included about 500 buses on the UP-Rajasthan borders and more than 300 buses remained present on the Delhi-Ghaziabad borders. About 36,000 migrant workers would have reached their home on Tuesday if these buses had been allowed to run. Another 36,000 would have reached their home safe on Wednesday. By now, 92,000 migrant labourers would have been transported,” she said.“I want to tell our migrant brothers and sisters that each and every worker and leader of the Congress is with you. You will find our workers in every district on the way to provide food and water or look into other problems of yours. We will continue to help you with all our capability in this hour of crisis,” she added.The Congress made the offer of providing the buses at its expense on Saturday after many migrant workers were killed in road accidents; the offer was accepted on Monday. On Tuesday evening, the state government said only 879 of the 1,000 vehicles were buses, and the rest three-wheelers and other vehicles.Deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma said the Congress party’s move was a stunt aimed at deriving some political mileage.“There are no buses of the Congress party. These buses belong to the Rajasthan government. Doing politics in times of such an intense crisis was never ever done by a major political party,” he said in Lucknow.“Can any political party use the buses of the Rajasthan State Roadways Transport Corporation for its own? On what basis are these buses being run?” he asked.Congress spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi alleged the state government was obstructing efforts to help migrant workers.“One is astounded, one cannot understand - if it were not tragic for humanity, it would be comic. How is it that you will not allow to ferry the migrant workers of UP and Bihar? This is the cheapest form of politics. Will the Uttar Pradesh government stand up and explain to the nation,” he told reporters via a video conference.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/don-t-want-buses-will-take-them-back-priyanka-to-up-govt/story-zBZaukKAvJJ1SFeNW63fKP.html

20-05-2020||India||US says Covid-19 crisis gives India chance to become key part of new supply chain||The Covid-19 crisis has presented an opportunity for India to become a key part of new trusted supply chain relationships but it will have to reduce tariffs and adopt more welcoming policies for foreign players, a top US diplomat said on Wednesday.Alice Wells, the outgoing head of the state department’s South and Central Asia bureau, said bilateral trade had totalled almost a record $150 billion in 2019 but the US continues to have concerns about India’s “protected market that can be difficult and sometimes not provide a level playing field for foreign companies”.India and the US had made concerted efforts to finalise a limited trade deal ahead of President Donald Trump’s visit to the country in February but were unable to reach common ground on a range of issues. Before winding up the visit, Trump had held out hope for trade deal by the end of 2020.During an online briefing for journalists, Wells said she couldn’t predict whether the US Trade Representative and the Indian government would be able to finalise an agreement this year, but noted that the “impetus for achieving a trade deal is very much present”.Instead, Wells suggested that the Covid-19 crisis and the move by countries to carry out “a little bit of de-globalisation and of onshoring more of the critical production” could present an opportunity for India to become a bigger player in global supply chains.“I think there’s a very vigorous effort to diversify supply chains. This is a real moment of opportunity for India, by adopting more open and welcoming policies, by reducing tariffs that allow manufacturing companies inside of India to be part of a global supply chain – it’s a real moment of opportunity for us to create trusted supply chain relationships with one another,” she said.India, as one of the world’s foremost producers of pharmaceuticals, generic drugs and vaccines, can also play a “critically important role in the treatment and health of the world as we move out of the pandemic”, Wells said.In recent weeks, India has supplied hydroxychloroquine and other drugs to dozens of countries, including the US, both through commercial sales and grants. It has also sent medical rapid response teams to several countries, including the Maldives and Kuwait.On the other hand, Wells was very critical of China’s Belt and Road Initiative and the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, saying they were exposing countries such as Pakistan to “predatory loans”. The US is concerned about the lack of transparency in CPEC projects, unfair rates of profits guaranteed to Chinese state-owned organisations and distortions the project has caused in Pakistan’s economy, including a massive imbalance in trade with China, she said.“I think at a time of crisis like Covid, when the world is reeling from the economic consequences of having shut down parts of the economy, it is really incumbent on China to take steps to alleviate the burden that this predatory, unsustainable and unfair lending is going to cause Pakistan,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-says-covid-19-crisis-gives-india-chance-to-become-key-part-of-new-supply-chain/story-8ExH7LTezQOfozfk6T6R9H.html

All three were released on interim bail on Wednesday.Superintendent of police (City, Agra) Botre Pramod Rohan said: “The Congress state president was granted bail in the Agra case but was taken into custody by Lucknow police for a case filed at the Hazratganj police station (in the state capital).”Earlier, on Tuesday, a case was registered against the UP Congress chief under Sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) and 269 (Negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) of the Indian Penal Code, besides the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, according to the Agra police.“A case has been registered against Ajay Kumar Lallu under various sections of the IPC and the Epidemic Act at the Fatehpur Sikri police station. Lallu was arrested on Tuesday evening, and along with other Congress leaders, put in the Police Lines,” senior superintendent of police, Agra, Babloo Kumar said.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesSoon after the UP Congress chief’s release on interim bail, a special police team from Lucknow took him to the state capital in connection with a case of forgery registered against him and party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s private secretary Sandip Singh regarding the alleged discrepancies in the list of buses provided by the Congress party for the migrants. This case was registered at Hazratganj police station in Lucknow on late Tuesday evening.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19Pradeep Mathur, a four-time former Congress MLA from Mathura, said, “We were granted interim bail on furnishing personal bonds and the date of July 16 was fixed in the case. It appears to be political vendetta by Bharatiya Janata Party and its chief minister who have registered fake cases against our state president Ajay Kumar Lallu and kept him in custody for no valid reason.”Many Congress supporters had gathered at Gate No. 1 of Civil Court premises in Agra as they were waiting for Lallu. Police, however, entered through Gate No. 4 and produced him, along with the others, in court.There was chaos at the Civil Court compound gates when Lallu was taken away by the police. Party workers tried to block the vehicle in which he was being transported but the police applied mild force to disperse them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/buses-for-migrants-up-congress-chief-gets-bail-in-one-case-taken-into-custody-in-another/story-aMbaIv9xNUNHRH4bW9c2JK.html

He instructed the minister to conduct a field study of the present situation in the reserve and apprise the government. Sonowal stressed that the government is always in favour of sustainable development which is in sync with ecology. The CM’s statement comes at a time when students and environment activists in Assam have launched an online campaign with the hashtag #SaveDehingPatkai to stop coal mining in the elephant reserve.The campaign follows a recommendation by the National Board of Wild Life (NBWL) last month that part of 98.59 hectares of the reserve forest be used for opencast coal mining. The rest of the area could be considered for underground coal mining, the body said.The move is expected to have a negative effect on flora and fauna in Dehing Patkai elephant reserve, which is part of Dehing Patkai wildlife sanctuary spread across 111 sq km in Dibrugarh and Tinsukia districts. It is said to be the largest tropical lowland rainforest in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-savedehingpatkai-campaign-assam-cm-commits-to-save-environment/story-10SoNG2BcKu69tHUuSTVuL.html

Here’s what to expect||The civil aviation minister has announced a gradual resumption of domestic flights from May 25 following the easing of restrictions on interstate travel in the fourth phase of nationwide lockdown. Flying, however, will not be the same while the fight against coronavirus continues. Here is a list of possible changes governing domestic flying that may come into force once the new flying protocol is notified by the civil aviation ministry. 1. Physical distancing measures and screening are likely to be followed at the airports. Wearing of masks and maintenance of at least four-feet physical distance from co-passengers is likely to be enforced.2. Passengers will be required to wash or sanitise their hands frequently. The bureau of civil aviation has already issued guidelines for the enhancement of admissible limit of hand sanitisers to be carried in cabin baggage.3. A system for contact-less check-in, including web check-in, is likely to be followed.4. The stamping of boarding passes may be suspended to reduce contact between passengers and the security staff.5. In a draft standard operating procedures (SOPs) proposed by the civil aviation ministry for passengers, airlines and airport operators, it was suggested that cabin luggage should be barred.For Coronavirus Live Updates6. The draft SOPs had also suggested suspending passenger ID checks to minimise crowding at terminal gates.7. Inside the plane, the middle seats may not be left vacant as was mooted earlier, since it may lead to an unreasonable escalation in the cost of tickets.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-198. The government may also introduce a cap on airfares to protect the consumers as a temporary measure, officials said.9. The domestic flights are likely to resume operation to major tier-I cities initially. 10. Senior citizens aged above 80 years may not be given the nod for air travel yet.11. Passengers may have to be quarantined as per the state government’s protocols. 12. Fliers may be advised to download the Aarogya Setu app on mobile phones 13.

20-05-2020||India||Real targets of Nepal PM Oli’s new political map are in Kathmandu||Nepal prime minister KP Sharma Oli’s push to fast-track release of a new political map on Wednesday is linked to his huge climbdown last month when he had to cancel an ordinance within five days, people familiar with the development said.There is a concerted effort by the Oli government in recent days to play the anti-India card to whip up ultra-nationalistic emotions to settle domestic scores, sources told Hindustan Times.“By raising an ultra-nationalistic sentiment, Oli has left his comrades - former PMs, Pushpa Kamal Dahal “Prachanda” and Madhav Kumar Nepal - with no option but to side with him and make India the casualty in the cross-firing between the two groups, a second person, a Kathmandu watcher, said.Nepal’s new political map that claims the Lipulekh Pass, Limpiyadhura and Kalapani in Uttarakhand’s Pithoragarh as its own is only one part of this exercise. PM Oli’s statement in parliament on Tuesday that claimed the coronavirus infection coming from India is “more lethal” than those from China and Italy is another.The two former prime ministers, who have been accused of destabilising the KP Sharma Oli-led government, are seen to have played a lead role in the tug-of-war that played out in Nepal’s power politics.At a time when Nepal, like the rest of the world was battling Covid-19, the prime minister had surprised his country when he got twin ordinances notified.These two made it easier for parties to split and register a new faction and were widely perceived to be part of an exercise by PM Oli to strengthen himself in the party and the government.But he had to stand down on April 23 and scrap the ordinances within five days to buy peace with his prime detractors. Energy minister Barsaman Pun told the Kathmandu Post that the Cabinet scrapped the ordinance following what he described as “excessive criticism”.According to reports from Nepal, the Communist Party of China’s international liaison department also stepped up efforts to broker peace between the comrades in Nepal.It was this shade of domestic power play at work when land management minister Padma Kumari Aryal on Wednesday held up a new map of Nepal. According to a report in the Kathmandu Post on her Press conference, she hoped India would take Nepal’s decision to publish the new map in a “positive way”. She didn’t elaborate.The 80-km stretch of road that New Delhi built Uttarakhand’s Dharchula to Lipulekh to make it easier for pilgrims to reach Kailash Mansarovar in the Tibet Autonomous Region offered the perfect opportunity.Army chief Gen Manoj Mukund Naravane brushed aside the shrill voices from Kathmandu, underlining that there was no dispute over the land on which the road had been built. Gen Naravane went on to suggest that the protests could be at the behest of “someone else” – a veiled reference to China.Prime Minister Oli, who is seen to be heavily tilting towards China, has described Gen Naravane’s comment as “inappropriate”.KALAPANIKalapani is a 35 square kilometre area in Uttarakhand’s Pithoragarh district. Nepal claims this area as part of its Darchula district.The tri-junction point of Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura in Nepal’s northwest separates China and the Tibet Autonomous Region to the north and India’s Kumaon to the south. The Mahakali river has been considered as a natural demarcation line to separate the borders.Indian security officials say China has tacitly recognised India’s claim over the Kalapani area when it agreed to open a border trade post at Lipulekh in 2015.India reacts to Nepal’s mapThe external affairs ministry described the new political map as an “artificial enlargement of territorial claims” and asked Kathmandu to refrain from “unjustified cartographic assertion”.“This unilateral act is not based on historical facts and evidence. It is contrary to the bilateral understanding to resolve the outstanding boundary issues through diplomatic dialogue,” External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/real-targets-of-nepal-pm-oli-s-new-political-map-are-in-kathmandu/story-mVL7k2tDorroQRwxjl2L3O.html
20-05-2020||India||Coast guard officer who arrived from Mumbai tests Covid-19 positive in Goa||An officer of the Coast Guard who arrived in Goa from Mumbai has tested positive for the coronavirus on Wednesday, being one among four people who tested positive over the last 24-hours in Goa. “The officer who arrived with a team of others has been admitted to the Covid-19 Hospital in South Goa while his co-travellers have been quarantined,” Health Secretary Nila Mohanan told a news conference.Goa’s Covid-19 total tally touched 50 on Wednesday evening with the number expected to climb higher as the test results of 471 people who arrived on a chartered flight are awaited. “We have ramped up the capacity of the Covid-19 hospital from 100 to 170 and the number of beds will be increased to 220 over the next few days,” Mohanan said. Barring two people, all the others admitted in the hospital are asymptomatic, she added. Among the others who tested Covid-19 positive is a passenger who arrived by train and two others who arrived by road. Goa has put in place Covid-19 testing protocols for all people arriving in the state by rail, air or road, which on the flip side has led to long waiting tenures for people who disembark as swab samples are collected before they are taken to quarantine centres. If found negative, the travellers are discharged and sent on home quarantine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coast-guard-officer-who-arrived-from-mumbai-tests-covid-19-positive-in-goa/story-50t2x46JKbVFkfFSIM3QmN.html
20-05-2020||India||‘Reminder of threat posed by Beijing’: US backs India amid border tensions with China||The US on Wednesday strongly backed India amid its simmering border tensions with China, with the Trump administration’s pointperson for South Asia saying such disputes are a “reminder of the threat posed by China”.Alice Wells, the outgoing head of the state department’s South and Central Asia bureau, said there like-minded nations such as the US, India, Australia and Asean states have rallied together in the face of China’s “provocations and disturbing behaviour”.The remarks, made in the course of an online briefing for journalists, came against the backdrop of simmering tensions in Ladakh and Sikkim sectors of the Line of Actual Control (LAC), where India and China have deployed additional troops. China on Tuesday also accused Indian forces of crossing into Chinese territory.The top US diplomat also addressed India’s role as a critical player in Afghanistan, saying it was for New Delhi to decide whether it wants to directly engage with the Taliban. However, she suggested that with the Taliban set to join the emerging governing structure in Kabul, it would be necessary for India and any future Afghan government to have a “healthy relationship”.Answering a question on the recent India-China tensions, Wells replied: “The flare-ups on the border, I think, are a reminder that Chinese aggression is not always just rhetorical. And so whether it’s in the South China Sea or whether it’s along the border with India, we continue to see provocations and disturbing behaviour by China that raises questions about how China seeks to use its growing power.”She added, “What we want to see is an international system that provides benefit to everyone and not a system in which there is suzerainty to China. And so I think in this instance, the border disputes are a reminder of the threat posed by China.”China’s actions have led to a “rallying of like-minded nations, whether it’s through Asean or through other diplomatic groupings – the trilateral that the US has with Japan and India or the quadrilateral with Australia – and conversations that are taking place globally”, Wells said.India is and will remain a “critical player” in Afghanistan and this was reflected in US special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad’s decision to travel to New Delhi amid the Covid-19 lockdown for consultations with the Indian leadership last week, Wells said.Khalilzad had said in an interview that India should engage with the Taliban. Asked about the issue, Wells replied: “We defer to India as to whether it wants to engage directly with the Taliban.“But in a situation where we are seeking through a negotiated political settlement to have the Taliban as part of that political governing structure, that government’s relationship with India should be close, and we believe that a healthy Afghanistan is going to need to have a healthy relationship with India.”Wells was less forthcoming on a question about the US-Taliban agreement signed in February having no guarantees about Afghan soil being used by anti-India terror groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed that are known to have links with the Taliban.The Taliban, she said, have made commitments against international terrorism, and the US is committed to ensuring that Afghan soil is never used as a base for “terrorism directed against us, the region and our friends and partners”. Noting the $3 billion in aid and political and diplomatic support provided by New Delhi to Kabul, she added, “Obviously, it’s up to India to determine how best to support the peace process.”Wells also noted that the core principles of President Donald Trump’s South Asia Strategy of 2107 remain in place – that Pakistan must take “decisive action against militant groups” and that India is “an important partner in Afghanistan’s development”. Trump’s suspension of security assistance to Pakistan in January 2018 “demonstrated our resolve”, she said.The South Asia Strategy also marked a major change by seeking to hold Pakistan accountable for the presence of terrorist groups on its soil. Pakistan has taken “initial steps” to curtail terror groups that threaten the region, such as arresting and prosecuting LeT leader Hafiz Saeed and beginning to dismantle terrorist financing structures, she said.With the formation of an inclusive government by President Ashraf Ghani and his rival Abdullah Abdullah, Wells said, the time has come to “double down” in Afghanistan and take forward the peace process and to root out the Islamic State, which has committed despicable acts of violence such as the attack on a maternity hospital in Kabul.“It is against groups like ISIS that we believe the Afghan government and Taliban should make common cause and you’re only going to be able to defeat the most vicious of these terrorists by reaching a peace agreement that allows a unified and total response to the threat posed by these terrorist organisations,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/reminder-of-threat-posed-by-beijing-us-backs-india-amid-border-tensions-with-china/story-MYLVZr5sna0awWvhGsxulO.html
20-05-2020||India||Bengal’s Covid-19 confirmation rate decreases even as testing triples||Bengal’s Covid-19 positive confirmation rate – percentage of persons testing positive for every 100 samples tested – is recording a significant decrease despite a sharp rise in the number of tests, a trend that stands in contrast of those in its neighbouring states and some other major states. Over the past fortnight, while Bengal’s average daily testing increased by over 227%, the average number of persons testing positive on day increased by only 33%. This has resulted in a sharp decline in the state’s positive confirmation rate, from 4.87% on May 5 to 3.11% on May 19, helping Bengal to improve its position.As on May 20, India’s positive confirmation rate stood at 4.2%, with 105,750 people testing positive for 2,512,388 samples tested. This was slightly lower than 4.5% on April 22. In the first month of the lockdown, India’s testing had increased 24 times whereas the number of new positive cases grew by 16 times, chairman of India’s Covid-19 Empowered Group 2 had said on April 23. In contrast, Bengal’s improvement is sharper. Between May 5 and 7, the state tested 7,637 samples, averaging 2,545 per day. In those three days, 289 people tested positive, with an average of 96 people daily. However, between May 17 and 19, the state tested 24,994 samples, with 8,331 tests daily on an average. During these three days, 385 people tested positive, with an average of 128 people per day.This trend stands in contrast to those observed in neighbouring Bihar and Odisha, and the large states of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Rajasthan and Maharashtra, where positive confirmation rate increased with the number of average daily tests, even if slightly. In Tamil Nadu, number of tests remained below 10,000 per day till May 4 and the state had a positive confirmation rate of 2.32% (4,058 positive of 174,232 samples tested). After testing another 173,055 samples between May 6 and May 19, with an average of 12,363 tests per day, the state’s positive confirmation rate stood at 3.58% (12,448 positives out of 347,287 samples tested). In Bihar, as the number of tests increased, the positive confirmation rate rose from 1% on May 6 to 2.9% on May 19. In Odisha, the positive confirmation rate increased from .38% on May 5 to .97% on May 18.The positive confirmation rate in Rajasthan remained almost the same – 2.31% on May 6 (3,177 people testing positive for 137,287 tests) to 2.33% on May 19 (5,845 people testing positive for 250,800 tests). The state’s increase in daily number of new cases has been in parity with the increase in the number of tests.Between May 7 and 9, a total 18,717 tests were conducted, averaging 6,239 tests per day, with 531 persons testing positive, averaging 177 persons per day. Between May 17 and 19, a total 32,455 tests were conducted averaging 10,815 tests per day, and 885 people tested positive, with an average of 295 people daily.Maharashtra’s ratio in increase in number of tests and the number of people testing positive rose almost in parity. It tested 28,428 samples during May 6-8, with an average of 9,476 samples daily, and altogether 3,538 people tested positive, averaging 1,779 people per day. During May 16-18, the state tested 32,457 samples averaging 10,819 tests per day, during which 5,958 people tested positive, or 1,986 people daily on an average.In Karnataka, too, number of people testing positive increased with the number of tests. Between May 5 and 7, Karnataka tested 14,342 people, with a daily average of 4,780 tests and overall 54 people testing positive. Between May 16 and May 18, when it tested 17,939 samples with a daily average of 5,979 tests, the state recorded 190 new cases.Bengal’s ruling party, Mamata Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress (TMC), claimed that this was because of the state’s success in containing the spread of the diseases. “The data reflects the state’s success in containing the diseases by enforcing a successful lockdown. People’s cooperation made every containment zone a success story,” said Santanu Sen, TMC Rajya Sabha MP and a doctor by qualification. Sen has been one of the important persons in chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s Covid-19 management team.Public health experts Rezaul Karim and Punyabrata Goon, too, felt that Bengal may have managed to contain the spread to some extent. Koushik Chaki, secretary of West Bengal Doctors’ Forum, however, was of the opinion that the figures may be a reflection of large number of tests conducted in relatively lesser affected areas. “Some pool testing has been conducted in north Bengal. A large number of tests have been conducted in the eight north Bengal districts and Murshidabad in south Bengal, where the virus’ spread has been nominal,” Chaki said. A total of 74,711 tests were conducted in the state between May 5 and 19, of which 27,358 were conducted in the eight districts of north Bengal and Murshidabad. These nine districts have reported only 93 of the state’s 2,961 positive cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-s-covid-19-confirmation-rate-decreases-even-as-testing-triples/story-XzH9gKATXVkhV8m1U35CyJ.html

As such under no circumstances, the Union Government could have come up with the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, which dilutes the constitutional, legislative and administrative safeguards of the Assamese people,” the plea said.A bench, headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde, issued notice to the central and Assam governments on Wednesday and tagged the matter to be heard with other petitions challenging the CAA.The CAA which was passed in December 2019 amends Section 2 of the Citizenship Act, 1955, which defines “illegal migrants”. According to change in definition, any person belonging to Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi or Christian communities from Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan, and who have been exempted by the Central Government under the Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920 or the Foreigners Act, 1946, shall not be treated as “illegal migrant”. Consequently, such persons shall be eligible to apply for citizenship by naturalisation, which is laid down under Section 6 of the 1955 act.The exclusion of Muslim community from the benefits of CAA had led to widespread protests across the country, as did the linking of citizenship with religion. There have also been protests against a proposed all-India National Register of Citizens (NRC).Over 150 petitions were filed in the Supreme Court challenging the law based on the alleged discrimination against Muslims.However, the challenge mounted by All Assam Law Students Union is based on the impact the CAA could have on the Assamese identity and how it violates various laws and agreements enacted by the union government to identify and deport illegal migrants and preserve Assamese identity.The central government had enacted Immigration (Expulsion from Assam) act in 1950 to protect the indigenous people of Assam. This was done after the influx of Bengali speaking people into Assam from East Pakistan after the partition of the country in 1947.There was a further exodus of Bengalis to Assam during the liberation of East Pakistan by India in 1971 and the formation of Bangladesh.This eventually culminated in an agitation by the Assamese people and the Assam Accord was signed between the central government, All Assam Students Union (AASU) and the All Assam Gana Sangram Parished (AAGSP) in 1985.The Assam Accord mandated that foreigners who came to Assam on or after March 25, 1971 shall be detected, deleted and practical steps shall be taken to expel such foreigners.Pursuant to the Assam Accord, the central government in 1985 inserted section 6A in the Citizenship Act. As per the same, illegal migrants who entered Assam from Bangladesh up to March 24, 1971 were granted citizenship of India but a specific assurance was also given that illegal migrants entering the state of Assam on or after March 25, 1971 would be deported back to Bangladesh.The petitioner claimed that the CAA makes section 6A of the Citizenship Act and the Assam Accord meaningless. It would enable illegal immigrants to become Indian citizens and the entire process set up by the Assam Accord and section 6A would be diluted.“Bringing outsiders or including the illegal immigrants as citizens shall worsen the situation and cause serious after-effects in the cultural, economical, social and political genre of Assam,” the petition said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/caa-threatens-assamese-culture-and-identity-says-plea-in-supreme-court/story-oR4pEDhaszORdtAURr8EjK.html
20-05-2020||India||Telangana HC asks govt to allow private labs to conduct Covid-19 tests||The Telangana high court on Wednesday directed the state government to allow authorised private labs in the state to conduct Covid-19 tests and private hospitals to treat such patients.A division bench of the high court comprising Justice M S Ramachandra Rao and Justice K Lakshman found fault with the Telangana government headed by chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao for insisting that people should get tested for Covid-19 only in state-authorised labs at Gandhi Hospital and Nizam’s Institute of Medical Sciences (NIMS) and go for treatment only in government hospitals.“This is highly unconstitutional. People have every right to get tested and treated at private labs and hospitals respectively at their own cost. The government cannot bring pressure on anyone to go only to the state-run hospitals,” the bench observed, while dealing with a public interest litigation petition filed by one Ganta Jaya Kumar of Hyderabad.However, the court ruled that only those private hospitals and labs which are authorised by the Indian Council of Medical Research could admit patients and conduct tests for Covid-19.“Those private labs and hospitals willing to deal with Covid-19 cases should apply for permission from ICMR. Experts from ICMR would assess the capacity of the labs and facilities available in the hospitals before giving permission. The ICMR will also fix rates for the tests and treatment,” the bench said.The high court wondered how the government could alone tackle the Covid-19 which was rapidly spreading in the country without the support of private institutions. “At present, government labs are conducting tests only for those who have symptoms of Covid-19. What about asymptomatic patients? What is the objection by the government if those asymptomatic patients go to private labs to get tested for Covid-19 at their own cost? Does it not reduce the burden on the government?” the court asked.The court did not agree with the contention of the state government that the private hospitals, if given permission, might misuse the same and hide the actual figures. “If the government has no faith on the private hospitals, why is it allowing them to treat patients under Arogya Sri scheme?” it questioned.Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, in the past, had ruled out giving permission to private labs and hospitals to deal with Covid-19 cases on the pretext that they would fleece the people in the name of tests and treatment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-hc-asks-govt-to-allow-private-labs-to-conduct-covid-19-tests/story-ZeELdCjppSYON2cEaXpRHO.html
20-05-2020||India||‘Artificial enlargement of territorial claims’: India on Nepal’s new map||India on Wednesday said Nepal’s new political map, which depicts Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura as part of Nepalese territory, amounts to “artificial enlargement of territorial claims” that won’t be accepted by New Delhi.The external affairs ministry’s sharply worded response came hours after Nepal’s land management minister Padma Kumari Aryal unveiled the map at a function in Kathmandu attended by political leaders and officials. The three territories were shown as part of Byas rural municipality in Sudurpaschim province.Aryal said she hoped India will take Nepal’s decision to publish the new map in a “positive way”.But external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said Nepal’s revised official map “includes parts of Indian territory”. He said in a statement: “This unilateral act is not based on historical facts and evidence.“It is contrary to the bilateral understanding to resolve the outstanding boundary issues through diplomatic dialogue. Such artificial enlargement of territorial claims will not be accepted by India.”Nepal is aware of India’s consistent position on this issue and the government should “refrain from such unjustified cartographic assertion and respect India’s sovereignty and territorial integrity”, Srivastava said. India hopes the Nepalese leadership will “create a positive atmosphere for diplomatic dialogue” to resolve boundary issues, he added.Kathmandu’s move came little more than six months after New Delhi published new maps of the union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh that showed Kalapani as part of Uttarakhand state.Nepal’s council of ministers had approved the new map during a meeting chaired by Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli on Monday.“The map will come into use immediately…The areas of Gunji, Navi and Kuti, near Kalapani, which had been left out in earlier maps, are also included in the new map,” Aryal was quoted as saying by The Kathmandu Post.Unnamed Nepalese officials were quoted by the Post as saying that the country’s total area has increased from 147,181 sq km to 147,516 sq km after the addition of “disputed land that is currently occupied by India”.The diplomatic row began on May 8 after defence minister Rajnath Singh opened an 80-km road that ends at Lipulekh Pass on the border with China. The road was built so that pilgrims going to Kailash-Mansarovar in the Tibet Autonomous Region can avoid dangerous high-altitude routes through Sikkim and Nepal.Nepal’s foreign ministry summoned the Indian envoy last week to protest against the construction of the road. New Delhi had rejected Kathmandu’s protest, saying Lipulekh is “completely within the territory of India”.While addressing Nepal’s Parliament on Tuesday, Oli said the decision to include the three territories in Nepal’s map was made after India inaugurated “a road link through Nepali territory”.

20-05-2020||India||Wrong to blame expatriates for rising Covid-19 numbers, says Kerala CM||Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Wednesday said it was wrong to blame expatriates and people who came from other states for the spurt in Covid-19 cases but conceded that the rising numbers pose a fresh challenge to the state.“Some people are giving a different interpretation to the tough procedure being adopted by the government. We are only trying to identify the source to equip ourselves to combat the disease. They have every right to come back to their state. Due to the peculiar situation some restrictions are there,” he said. Vijayan’s comment came in the wake of a campaign in social media alleging the government was very harsh towards NRIs after positive cases of Covid-19 went up.“The state’s progress is because of the contributions of the expatriates. We really salute our brethren. Some people are trying to create an ill-feeling and we hope expatriates will realise this,” he said adding the whole state must unite to combat the virus and it was not the responsibility of health workers alone. In view of rising cases the government will have to strengthen its surveillance in coming days, he said.The state reported 24 new Covid-19 cases on Wednesday out of which 12 had returned from Persian Gulf countries, 11 came from other states and one contracted the disease from an infected person, he said.The recovery of five persons turned out to be a big relief for the state which has been witnessing a spurt in cases with more than 150 cases surfacing the last eight days. Kerala’s tally now stands at 666 out of 161 are active while the rest have been discharged from hospitals.The CM said some people who are in home quarantine are interacting with other family members and it poses a serious threat. “Home quarantine means room quarantine. Only one person in the family is allowed to interact with the person in quarantine, that too after keeping distance and other norms. But we came to know some are not following this,” he said adding they are endangering the lives of their family members.After much confusion, Vijayan said the state government will conduct remaining examinations of Class X (SSLC) and Plus Two from May 26 to May 30 and all arrangements were made for this. Three pending examinations of the SSLC will be conducted from May 26-28. The lockdown came while the examinations were on and later three of them were postponed indefinitely. At least 4.2 lakh candidates will appear for these examinations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wrong-to-blame-expatriates-for-rising-covid-19-numbers-says-kerala-cm/story-zbUPN8suuemS3Jz8KKGKNM.html
20-05-2020||India||Migrants fall from Ganga bridge in Amroha, one dead, another injured||One of the two migrant labourers from Uttar Pradesh, who fell from a bridge over the Ganga at Amroha-Hapur border on Tuesday, died and the other is critical.Sanjeev Kumar from Mohaddinpur village of Shahjahanpur and his companion Pyarelaal from Samaspur village of Bareilly were rushed to the Meerut medical college where Sanjeev died during the treatment. Pyarelaal is currently battling for his life.Both the migrant labourers worked in Delhi and were returning to their native places along with their family members in a shared taxi. The incident took place when hundreds of labourers coming from Delhi and Haryana swarmed the Ganga Bridge. The crowd swelled as the police had barricaded the road preventing their entry into Amroha’s Gajraula. This led to a jam.Eyewitnesses said the police resorted to a mild force to restore order which resulted in a melee on the bridge following which the two labourers jumped into the river. They fell on one of the pillars of the bridge instead of landing in water.The police, however, denied using force to disperse the crowd on the bridge.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesAmroha superintendent of police Vipin Tada said, “There was no stampede on the bridge. During the investigation, we found that they were trying to jump from one bridge to the other running parallel and fell down. Their family members did not know of the accident. They had reached their destination when we contacted them. The victim’s body was handed over to his relatives after the postmortem.”The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19Following several such incidents of migrant labourers trying to enter the state by crossing river Ganga, the local administration has deployed police on the river’s banks and its tributaries and canals to keep migrants from entering without proper registration.According to officials, registration of incoming migrant labourers is mandatory along with screening and subsequent quarantine.A large number of migrant labourers have been entering UP from Uttarakhand and Haryana while on the way to their native places in eastern UP and Bihar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/migrants-fall-from-ganga-bridge-in-amroha-one-dead-another-injured/story-E19mUllnAcTjtJN0lW6fKL.html
20-05-2020||India||6.39% of total active Covid-19 cases needed hospital support: Health ministry||About 6.39 per cent of the total number of active Covid-19 cases in the country needed hospital support, the Union health ministry said on Wednesday.During a briefing on the COVID-19 situation, joint secretary in the ministry Lav Agarwal also said about 2.94% of the active COVID-19 cases needed oxygen support, 3% needed intensive care units (ICU) and 0.45% required ventilator support.“Only around 6.39% of COVID-19 cases need either oxygen support or ICU or ventilator support; many people are recovering due to early identification. At the same time, we are also upgrading our healthcare infrastructure,” he said.“During lockdown, we have upgraded our hospital infrastructure, including oxygen supported beds, ICU beds and ventilators. Our efforts give us confidence that we are ready and equipped, along with states, to manage COVID-19 cases,” he added.Agarwal said the health ministry analysed the data from the recently released WHO situation report and found that while cases per lakh of world population stand at 62, in India, it was found that 7.9 people per lakh population were affected.“Despite similar population, total cases of COVID-19 in top 15 countries is 34 times that of India and despite similar population, total deaths due to COVID-19 in top 15 countries is 83 times that of India,” the joint secretary said.He further said so far, India has about 0.2 COVID-19 deaths per lakh population as against the global figure of 4.1.Among the countries with high COVID-19 casualties, the US with 87,180 fatalities has 26.6 deaths per lakh population. The UK has reported 34,636 deaths and has approximately 52.1 deaths per lakh population.“While our deaths are a matter of grief, we find that six countries have reported more than 10,000 COVID-19 deaths, together with states and citizens. We have relatively been able to manage the situation, though the challenge still continues,” Agarwal said.When the lockdown started, the COVID-19 recovery rate was 7.1 per cent which gradually improved to 39.62%, he said.He said the government’s focus will be on stringent containment measures, hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene, environmental sanitation and conversion of physical distancing into a life norm.The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), responding to a question on whether the government is planning to drop hydroxychloroquine from the COVID-19 treatment plan, said a review of its efficacy will be held to decide on its prophylaxis.Head of epidemiology and communicable diseases at ICMR Raman R Gangakhedkar said 25.36 lakh COVID-19 tests have been done till 12.30 pm on Tuesday. For the second time, more than one lakh tests were conducted within a span of 24 hours.“There are 555 testing laboratories and 89,466 tests (were) done in ICMR labs yesterday (Tuesday),” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/6-39-of-total-active-covid-19-cases-needed-hospital-support-health-ministry/story-sNxlnXCiOtFl6T4oPs8D1N.html

20-05-2020||India||Assam issues fresh guidelines for flood relief camps in view of Covid-19||The Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA) has issued a fresh set of guidelines for the management of flood relief camps in the state this year because of the unforeseen coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak.Floods during monsoon affect a majority of Assam’s 33 districts each year and displace several lakhs of people. Most of the displaced spend weeks in schools or temporary relief camps till the time the floodwaters subside.“This year the challenge to support those who might get affected due to annual flood menace will be even tougher due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic across the globe, which has also affected our state,” said Pankaj Chakrabarty, state project coordinator, ASDMA.The new guidelines have urged the district authorities to identify additional relief camps as per population density of villages to earmark space for social distancing norms. Earlier, 3.5 square metres of space in relief camps were earmarked for each person at a relief camp. However, the allotted space will be doubled this year to ensure the mandatory one-metre social distancing is maintained between two inmates at a relief camp.All arrangements have been made, including the availability of face masks and hand sanitisers, at relief camps, which have been notified as no-spitting and no-tobacco zones.“Daily monitoring (in place of weekly) of the health condition of inmates will be done by medical teams, who will be equipped with personal protective equipment (PPE) units for conducting special screening during the registration process,” said the guidelines.“If an inmate is found to be sneezing and suffering from common cold immediate medical supervision will be made. The patient must be isolated as per Covid-19 norms and regulations,” it added.The district authorities have been asked to prepare standard operating procedures (SOPs) for the distribution of relief items and cooked food complying with precautionary measures.“Quarantine isolation facilities have to be identified on higher altitudes by the district administration for transfer of Covid-19 suspect cases,” the guidelines said.To ensure proper management of livestock, the district authorities have been asked to identify highland areas such as tea gardens with grasses “for the arrangement of the green fodder for livestock of the farmers/camp inmates”.Assam has reported 158 Covid-19 positive cases till Tuesday. While four Covid-19 patients have died so far, 42 have recovered, 110 patients are still undergoing treatment in hospitals and another two have left for their native places in West Bengal and Bihar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-issues-fresh-guidelines-for-flood-relief-camps-in-view-of-covid-19/story-Gb8uaZ7dGgkhDwW8IILNFO.html

This facility is also available at Shirdi Sai Samsthan in Shirdi, Maharashtra and Siddhi Vinayak temple (Mumbai).Subba Reddy said it was heartening to note that despite the lockdown restrictions, the devotees were generously offering money through e-hundi and displaying their devotion though they did not get to see the Lord for over 60 days as of now.He said in view of the tremendous response to the e-hundi from devotees, the TTD had decided to resume sale of the famous “Laddu Prasadam of Tirumala” in two or three days at a discount of 50%.“Instead of the regular price of Rs 50 per laddu weighing 175 grams, it will now be sold at Rs 25 per laddu. This discount will continue till the darshan of the Lord resumes after the lifting of lockdown,” he said.The sale of laddu would be done at all TTD Kalyana Mandapams (Wedding halls) and information centres present in all 13 district headquarters in Andhra Pradesh, apart from those at Hyderabad, Chennai and Bengaluru state shortly”, he said.Stating that there was still uncertainty over resumption of the darshan of Lord Venkateshwara, the TTD chairman it would depend on the central government’s decision to lift the lockdown. “We have been receiving several calls and mails from the devotees regularly on reopening of the temple for darshan, but we can’t take a decision until the Centre decides on the lockdown,” he said.Reddy refuted the reports that the TTD was facing such a severe cash crunch that it had no money to maintain the temple administration and also pay staff salaries.“There is no scarcity of funds and there will not be any problem to pay salaries and pensions to our employees as well for maintenance. We have paid salaries to the employees for March and April and have enough money to pay May salaries as well,” he asserted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/devotees-donate-rs-2-cr-to-india-s-richest-temple-in-april-under-e-hundi/story-X5uJpGltnC3k28ZhqThNFO.html

He was arrested on Tuesday and handed over to the NIA, which has now shifted him to Jammu.”Sources said Rustam Ali was a close associate of Hizbul Mujahideen commander Riyaz Naikoo who was killed in an encounter with security forces earlier this month.The Parihar brothers were shot from point blank range in November 2018 and RSS leader Chandrakant Sharma and his body guard were killed in April 2019. All the murders took place in Kishtwar town.Rustam’s arrest came two days after the killing of another Hizbul Mujahideen militant, Tahir Bhat, by security forces in Doda district.While Tahir was said to have been assigned the task of recruiting local youth into militant ranks in Doda district, Rustam had allegedly been recruiting youth in adjoining Kishtwar district.Tahir was also allegedly involved in the killing of RSS leader and his bodyguard.After eliminating Tahir, security forces have now launched a manhunt to nab the oldest surviving terrorist, Jehangir Saroori aka Mohammad Amin Bhat as the crackdown against the terror outfit continues in Jammu and Kashmir.“This militant is hiding in the upper reaches of Marwah and Dachhan belt in Kishtwar district adjoining Doda district. He is the oldest surviving terrorist in J&K and carries an award of around Rs 50 lakh on his head that was announced by the police and NIA,” said a senior police officer, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-takes-custody-of-hizbul-man-wanted-for-multiple-murders/story-pwLEfJ3vxntjfUW2c3xZTO.html

The court is happy to let the govt play for time & gave them till 1st June. Clearly they have no suitable reply to give,” NC vice president said in another tweet.Ahead of August 5, most of the Jammu and Kashmir mainstream politicians including Srinagar MP and former J&K chief minister Farooq Abdullah, his son Omar Abdullah and PDP president and former CM Mehbooba Mufti were detained.While most were released after their preventive detentions ended, five to six top politicians including NC general secretary Ali Mohammad Sager, former ministers, Nayeem Akthar, Sartaj Madni, Hilal Akbar Lone, Peer Mansoor and former IAS officer Shah Faesal were detained afresh under the PSA. Recently, PSA against Shah Faesal was extended by another three months by the J&K government.PSA was withdrawn against several politicians including Mehbooba Mufti and Peoples Conference chairman Sajjad Lone, but they have been put under house arrest at their official accommodation.The recently launched Apni party had also demanded the release of political leaders detained inside and outside the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/omar-abdullah-appeals-to-pm-modi-for-release-of-j-k-politicians-ahead-of-eid/story-cre8kfeyIYJ2DH69P5Ft7L.html

In the PM Garib Kalyan scheme -- introduced after lockdown, we gave some cash transfer. With that done, we weren’t closing the option,” Sitharaman said when asked if the government considered more immediate measure while deciding economic package.“For cash transfer, we thought it was far more effective because the way in which we’ve planned it, we thought there will be a greater multiplier effect, and therefore, it should be through banks, businesses for meeting the fixed cost expenditure; it should be money which is given for working capital; it should also money for loans so that they can buy raw materials,” she added. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had earlier this month announced Rs 20 lakh crore special economic package to deal with the situation created by the coronavirus and to make the country self-reliant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/measures-in-stimulus-package-aimed-at-greater-multiplier-effect-sitharaman/story-QbFw9Y4eoQRgRKCBbhnlUL.html

How we medically manage a positive case, how we are able to save a patient’s life and focus on good health care decides if we are doing a satisfactory job,” added Agarwal.Agarwal said that in another relatively-positive news, the recovery rate of coronavirus patients in the country, which stood at 7.1% at the beginning of the lockdown on March 25, increased to 11.42% at the beginning of the second phase of the lockdown and further to 26.59 % before reaching 39.62% as of May 19.Agarwal said that India had around 61,000 cases of Coved-19 under active treatment and only 2.94% of these were on oxygen support, 3% on ICU support and 0.4% on ventilator support.For Coronavirus Live Updates“This data is very important to us since it shows that because of our focus on early detection and surveillance leading to timely identification of cases, a very few percentages of infected patients need serious hospital management,” Agarwal said.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19Giving an update on the scaling up of the health infrastructure in the view of the pandemic, Agarwal said India currently had 1.5 lakh hospital beds available for treating coronavirus patients.

20-05-2020||India||Rajasthan battles locust invasion in 16 of 33 districts||Locusts that have crossed into Rajasthan from Pakistan are travelling far and wide across the state because of favourable wind conditions and lack of crops in the fields, officials said Wednesday.Locust swarms were reported from Bundi, Sikar, Pratapgarh and Chittorgarh districts, they said.“There’s no crop in the fields. Unable to find settling grounds and crops to devour, locust swarms are travelling far in search of food. The insects have also become irritable and fly at the sound of tractors or at sight of light when we launch control operations at night,” said Dr Om Prakash, agriculture commissioner.Rajasthan had reported a locust invasion in May last year after a gap of 26 years and the attack continued until February this year, damaging crop across 670,000 hectares in 12 districts. The state put the loss due to the locust invasion at about Rs 1,000 crore.In 2019, the swarms were first spotted in Jaisalmer.The Locust Warning Organization (LWO) of the Union ministry of agriculture and farmer welfare warned of another attack in May-June this year. The first locust attack this year was reported in Ganganagar, a north Rajasthan district bordering Pakistan, on May 11.LWO deputy director KL Gurjar said the Jodhpur-based organization feared last year that yellow matured adults may lay eggs in some places in Pakistan, leading to an outbreak in May-June this year.The agriculture commissioner said locusts generally settle on vegetation after sunset and fly again at around 9-10 am the next day, giving control teams enough time to spray pesticides at them.“This year, we are able to launch control efforts only around midnight because they are settling late. The current breed of locusts scuttles on hearing the sound of tractors, making our job more difficult. An unsettled swarm is highly mobile and can travel as much as 150 km a day if winds are favourable. These swarms can devour large quantity of vegetation and crops. The saving grace is, there’s no crop so there’s no damage,” he said.Many districts that did not report swarms last year such as Sirohi, Ajmer, Bhilwara, Pali, Pratapgarh, Sikar and Jhunjhunu, are reporting them this year. So far, locusts have been reported from more than half of Rajasthan, covering 16 out of 33 districts.Officials say that the desert locust has always been a major threat to man’s well-being. Just one small swarm of desert locust can eat the same quantity of crops in one day as 35,000 people. This year, there’s no damage so far. “Currently, they are settling on babool and khejdi trees,” Dr Om Prakash said.Meanwhile, the state agriculture department has controlled the outbreak on around 40,000 hectares, he added.Agriculture minister Lal Chand Kataria said the state government had provided 45 pickup vehicles to the LWO for their sprayers and deployed 70 vehicles for survey in fields. He said 600 tractor-mounted sprayers were also involved in control operations. “We have also invited bids for drones to spray pesticides in areas inaccessible to the vehicles,” he said.LWO sprayers can reach up to 7-8 feet, and those on tractors go up to 15-20 feet. The department has engaged fire tenders for greater heights. “Around 150 teams are working in 14 districts to identify places where control operations need to be launched,” the minister said.He said the department has provisioned Rs 5 crore for vehicles and Rs 10 crore for providing plant protection chemicals to farmers at 100% grant.Meanwhile, according to a status report by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), hopper groups, bands, and adult groups are present on the Indo-Pakistan border in Punjab of both countries.“Migration from the spring breeding areas in Baluchistan has commenced, and several immature adult groups and swarms have appeared in Rajasthan,” it said.The FAO has also released a global forecast according to which in addition to the current outbreak, locust swarms from new areas can also enter the Indian border from June 22.Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on April 24 and May 11 to seek Centre’s help in dealing with locust attacks. The CM also told the PM about the outbreak in the state during a video conference on May 18.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-battles-locust-invasion-in-16-of-33-districts/story-JigOjx43MpwlWfdaPAqz9I.html

20-05-2020||India||Domestic flights to resume ops in ‘calibrated manner’ from May 25, SOPs soon||Domestic flights in the country will resume operations from May 25, two months after the services were suspended following the nationwide lockdown imposed to stop the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).Union civil aviation minister Hardeep Puri on Wednesday announced that operations will recommence in a “calibrated manner” from Monday. “All airports and air carriers are being informed to be ready for operations from 25th May.Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for passenger movement are also being separately issued by civil aviation ministry,” he tweeted. The domestic flights that will be allowed to operate are likely to connect all major tier-I cities. Airports will facilitate limited domestic flights in phases and may be at 30% capacity to facilitate social distancing, the Airport Authority of India had stated in a set of guidelines for resumption of service post-lockdown, Hindustan Times had reported on April 30. India has also launched a concerted repatriation programme, by sea and air, to bring back stranded citizens stuck in various parts of the world, but with a strict set of preconditions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.All measures for social distancing and screening will be followed at the airports, officials said. Middle seats inside the plans may not be left vacant, an idea that was being considered earlier by the ministry, officials aware of the development said. The government may also not allow senior citizens aged above 80 years to board the flights. Passengers may have to be quarantined as per the state government’s protocols. The government may also introduce a cap on airfares, this is being done to protect the consumers and airlines as a temporary measure, officials said. In its guidelines for the fourth phase of lockdown, the home ministry had said all domestic and international passenger flights will remain suspended till May 31. Both domestic and international cargo flight operations have remained operational since the lockdown. The revised set of guidelines and SOP for the domestic flight operation will be issued on Wednesday, officials involved in the process said. A meeting with all airlines’ Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) is also scheduled to be held on Wednesday evening after which the SOP would be finalised, the official added.“We have been preparing for resuming domestic flights since a while and have made all the necessary arrangements but the states had expressed some reservations on resuming the operations in a meeting held a day before the home ministry guidelines were issued,” another official said. On Tuesday, Puri had said the state governments should be ready to allow civil aviation operations “in the spirit of cooperative federalism.”“It is not up to civil aviation ministry or centre alone to decide on resuming domestic flights,” he had said. Passengers will have to wear a mask and other protective gear and maintain at least four-feet physical distance from co-passengers, according to guidelines issued by the Airports Authority of India, and also may have to download the Aarogya Setu app on mobile phones. They will also be required to wash or sanitise their hands frequently, the AAI said. On Thursday the bureau of civil aviation issued guidelines for enhancement of admissible limit of hand sanitisers to be carried in cabin baggage.Those travelling will also have to do a web check-in before the journey. The stamping of boarding passes has also been suspended to reduce contact between passengers and security staff. There has been no word yet on resumption of international flights. “This resumption will go a long way in lifting the overall economic sentiment in the country. While the SOP for resumption of operations and details of flights to be operated is still awaited, we are sure that this much awaited move will help a large number of passengers by providing them access to the safest and quickest means of transport… We will strictly adhere to social distancing norms and SOPs laid down by the Government to ensure the best, the cleanest and the most sanitised flying experience,” said Ajay Singh, Chairman and Managing Director, SpiceJet. In a draft standard operating procedures (SOPs) proposed by the civil aviation ministry, it was suggested that cabin luggage be disallowed. The SOP had also suggested passenger ID checks will not be required so as to minimise the crowd at terminal gates.The Centre will also issue guidelines for the movement of passengers for reaching the airport from different zones including containment areas, similar to the rules for passengers travelling in trains, officials said. “As per the government announcement made today, we will be resuming flight operations from Monday, May 25, 2020 in a phased manner. We are fully prepared with safety measures w.r.t. Covid-19 across all our passenger and CarGo interfaces during their journey with us. We will share further details and guidelines for passengers, in line with the advisory from the authorities over the next few days,” IndiGo said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/domestic-flights-to-begin-operations-from-may-25-guidelines-to-follow/story-QtGOILBEMSDvW03WK3YNsO.html

However, we’re trying to adopt new strategies such as bringing about a change in the testing pattern and putting in place a more effective mechanism for migrant returnees to be kept under institutional quarantine,” said Dr. Gupta.In the past week, testing has gradually increased in the state, and pool testing also started in a few places. On May 17, 575 samples were tested, and 792 and 754 were tested on Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively.“Pool testing helps to increase the number of samples tested during a day. We’re looking at a sample size between 1,200 and 1,500 for a daily pool testing,” Dr. Gupta added.Under pool testing, all the samples of people in a certain batch are tested together. If the result comes negative, then it means none of the people has contracted SARS-CoV-2, which causes Covid-19. But, if the result turns out to be positive, then all the people of that batch are required to undergo individual tests.“If a person tests Covid-19 positive during pool testing, then more attention needs to be paid through contact tracing and conducting more tests on the other people that the infected person came in contact with,” said the senior health official.Over the past 48 hours, more Covid-19 positive cases have been reported from the hilly districts such as Uttarkashi, Almora, Chamoli, Bageshwar, and Pauri Garhwal.Earlier, Covid-19 positive cases were mostly restricted to the four main plain districts of Dehradun, Haridwar, Udham Singh Nagar, and Nainital.Uttarakhand has reported 120 Covid-19 positive cases till Wednesday, an increase of nine cases from the previous day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-covid-19-cases-surge-as-stranded-migrant-workers-return/story-sIBO4xjQEGwEM4zFPJaZ6N.html

Forest officials rushed to the spot and sent the carcass for post-mortem.Vinod Chandra, Deputy Ranger Chaukhutiya range in Almora forest division said, “Some people informed us that the carcass of a leopard was lying on the roadside near the forest on Godi Motor road in Chaukhutiya area in Almora”.“The leopard seems to be around 3 years old. There were no injury marks on its body but the rear part of the body was swollen. It is likely that the carcass is around seven to eight days old. The exact cause of death will be known after the post mortem,” Chandra said.The villagers in the area are in panic and have urged the forest department to start night patrol in the area.On May 12, two leopards were found dead in Uttarakhand within 24 hours. A carcass of a five-year leopard was found in Jyolikot area of Nainital stuck in a trap wire. In another incident, a ten-year-old leopard was found dead in Pithoragarh district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/leopard-found-dead-in-uttarakhand-s-almora-third-to-die-in-a-fortnight/story-hmMognc1vbH6UA4V3idHSI.html

The three territories were shown as part of Byas rural municipality in Darchula district of Sudurpaschim province.Aryal said she hoped India will take Nepal’s decision to publish the new map in a “positive way”.There was no immediate reaction from Indian officials.Nepal’s council of ministers had approved the map showing Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura as part of Nepalese territory during a meeting chaired by Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli on Monday.“The map will come into use immediately…The areas of Gunji, Navi and Kuti, near Kalapani, which had been left out in earlier maps, are also included in the new map,” Aryal was quoted as saying by The Kathmandu Post.Unnamed Nepalese officials were quoted by the Post as saying that the country’s total area has increased from 147,181 sq km to 147,516 sq km after the addition of “disputed land that is currently occupied by India”.The diplomatic row began on May 8 after defence minister Rajnath Singh opened an 80-km road that ends at Lipulekh Pass on the border with China. The road was built so that pilgrims going to Kailash-Mansarovar in the Tibet Autonomous Region can avoid dangerous high-altitude routes through Sikkim and Nepal.Nepal’s foreign ministry summoned the Indian envoy last week to protest against the construction of the road. New Delhi has rejected Kathmandu’s protest, saying the Lipulekh region is “completely within the territory of India” and that both sides could resolve such boundary issues through diplomatic dialogue.While addressing Nepal’s Parliament on Tuesday, Oli said the decision to include the three territories in the map of Nepal was made after India inaugurated “a road link through Nepali territory”. He also contended that people coming from India “through illegal channels” were spreading the Coronavirus in Nepal.India and Nepal share a 1,800-km open border. Nepal claims all territories east of the Kali river, including Limpiyadhura, Kalapani and Lipulekh, under the Treaty of Sugauli that it signed with the erstwhile British administration in 1816.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nepal-releases-new-political-map-showing-lipulekh-and-kalapani-as-part-of-its-territory/story-a1WJ5ctHvy010Ss1Y6jt4O.html

20-05-2020||India||Cabinet approves Rs 3,110 crore foodgrain package under Aatma Nirbhar Bharat package, 8 crore migrants to benefit||The union cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday approved the allocation of free foodgrains for approximately 8 crore migrants for the month of May and June as part of the relief announced by the centre under the Aatma Nirbhar Bharat Package. The economic package worth nearly Rs 21 lakh crore was announced by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman over five days last week and it contained monetary and policy interventions to revive the Indian economy as it battles the economic doom spelt by coronavirus pandemic.On May 14, while delivering the second chunk of the economic relief package, Sitharaman had announced that the central government had decided to extend the free foodgrain distribution scheme to migrants who were neither beneficiaries under the NFSA (National Food Security Act) or holders of state cards. She had valued the total cost of this intervention to about Rs 3,500 crore.The scheme involves the grant of foodgrain from the central pool to approximately 8 crore migrant labourers who are either stranded or have reached their homes. Every migrant will be eligible for receiving 5 kg of foodgrain a month for two months of May and June 2020. Centre said the cost of this subsidy will be in excess of Rs 3100 crore.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19“It would entail an estimated food subsidy of about Rs 2,982.27 crore. Further, the expenditure towards intra-state transportation and handling charges and dealer’s margin/additional dealer margin will account for about Rs 127.25 crore, which will be borne fully by the Central Government. Accordingly, the total subsidy from the Government of India is estimated at about of Rs.3,109.52 crore,” an official cabinet press document said.Migrant workers are among the worst-hit due to the lockdown imposed in the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak. The pandemic and its resultant economic and social impact has not only cost migrants their jobs and money, but also forced them to retreat to their home states in one of the largest workforce exodus seen in the recent times.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesSeveral migrant workers have even ended up losing their lives in accidents as they make a desperate dash to their homes in the absence of adequate public transport.The central government said the allocation will ease the hardships faced by the migrant workforce due to economic disruptions caused by Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cabinet-approves-rs-3-110-crore-foodgrain-package-under-aatma-nirbhar-bharat-package-8-crore-migrants-to-benefit/story-IGnFqGIAzeA7jHw9nAZvKO.html
20-05-2020||India||Goa: HC allows state board to conduct 10th and 12th exams||The high court (HC) of Bombay at Goa on Wednesday allowed the state board to conduct class X and XII examinations from Thursday, ending the examinees’ uncertainty and anxiety about their future prospects amid the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak.The HC disposed of a bunch of petitions that were filed seeking to defer the examinations because of the pandemic.Pravin Faldessai, Assistant Solicitor General, Goa, submitted in the court a written communication received from the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) late Tuesday night granting exemption to the state to conduct Class X and XII examinations from Thursday subject to certain conditions. On Tuesday, the court had directed the MHA to inform whether the board examinations could be conducted under the fresh guidelines issued by the ministry last Sunday about lockdown 4:0, which came into effect from Monday and will be in place till May 31 to contain the spread of the pandemic.Earlier, advocate General Devidas Pangam had told the court that “had the Central Government intended to prohibit the holding of examinations, then, it would have clearly stated that in its orders. No prohibition was ever intended, as there’s no specific bar.”However, late on Tuesday night, state chief secretary Parimal Rai wrote to the MHA, seeking an exemption from the lockdown to hold the board examinations, and the relief was given shortly.“The matter has been examined by the MHA taking into consideration the factual position. Goa doesn’t have a single local active case of Covid-19 (except for 39 positive cases of the people who had travelled from outside) and the onset of monsoon season during which the state will have difficulties in holding the examinations.“After taking into account these factors and the assurance given by the state government in ensuring all safety precautions, Goa is allowed to conduct board examinations for Classes 10 and 12,” the MHA said. The MHA stipulated that no examination centre would be permitted in the containment zone. Besides, teachers, students, and invigilators have to compulsorily wear face masks, provisions of thermal scanning facility and hand sanitisers to be made available at examination centres and social distancing norms must be strictly enforced.“The HC has permitted the state board to conduct class X and XII examinations on the basis of the MHA’s letter. There’s no legal impediment in holding the examinations,” said Advocate General Pangam. State chief minister Pramod Sawant welcomed the move to end the uncertainty for anxious board students.“The board examinations will start on Thursday. I hope people will cooperate to successfully conduct the examinations. At the end of the day, this exercise involves the future of our children. It’s important that everybody cooperates amid the viral outbreak,” the CM said.Altogether, 19,680 students will appear for the secondary school certificate (SSC) examinations, which will be held across 1,612 centres in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-hc-allows-state-board-to-conduct-10th-and-12th-exams/story-EspmxNFcRwi1as82t7sTxM.html

The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice S S Shinde was of the opinion that the presence of the civic chief was necessary to adjudicate such matters.The PIL filed by Sarika Singh, a resident of Kurla, cited the case of a police constable who was allegedly asked to deposit Rs 2 lakh by a private hospital in Vashi for admission when he approached them with Covid-19 like symptoms.According to the petition, the constable was made to wait for around five hours since he couldn’t arrange for the hefty sum. It was only after the local police station allegedly threatened to file an FIR against the hospital authorities for refusing a suspected coronavirus case that they admitted him with a reduced deposit of Rs 20,000.

20-05-2020||India||This phase has brought my family even closer: Vivek Prakash||For singer-composer Vivek Prakash, this lockdown brought a series of woes. The Lucknowite, now settled in Mumbai, was alone at his residence while his singer-wife Roli was stuck in Singapore. He fell ill to viral fever with no one around to take care of him. Thankfully his wife is back but is still in quarantine and he is looking forward to see her again after months now, shares the singer over phone.“I am much at peace now as I know that Roli will be out of quarantine soon. I am thankful to God, that the phase is over and together we will brave this extraordinary situation the world is facing. But, this phase has brought the family even closer despite we not being together,” said Vivek.For him it’s a matter of great pride that legend like Jagjit Singh has sung his composition, ‘Gudiya tujh par ik pal hasna, ik pal rona aaye’ for a movie. Also likes of Kumar Sanu, Alka Yagnik, Anup Jalota, Udit Narain, Sadhna Sargam and Vinod Rathod amongst others have rendered their voice to his compositions.Narrating his story, he tells, “After getting Sangeet Natak Academy Award in Lucknow in February, I came back for two concerts around Holi and returned on March 13. We were supposed to go to Singapore, Jakarta, Kuala Lampur for concerts. Roli left for Singapore on March 16 with our son. I was scheduled to fly on March 25 as I had to perform at an award function on the same day.”It was during those dates that the lockdown was imposed. “As all the flights were cancelled and I was stuck in Mumbai and my family in Singapore. I literally had a panic attack and then I fell severely ill. I was alone in my house managing food, taking telemedical consultation but my condition worsened. It was only when my brother came over that I got proper treatment. I was also tested for Covid-19. That was truly scary, I somehow survived the worst phase of my life when I was ill, alone and helpless.” Vivek used all his contacts and by ‘Vande Bharat Mission’ rescue flight his wife and son were brought to India. “It’s only technology that has kept us together. I think the phase has made us understand the importance of families. We have always been known as a ‘singing jodi’ but our real bond was realized in this period,” he said.The singer feels that the coming months are going to be very tough, “March, April and May had concerts lined-up. But, now we don’t performances happening anytime soon. It’s going to be a very tough time for middle-class artistes like us who are dependent on shows for their bread and butter. Hope, something good happens soon as expenses remain intact but inflow has stopped. I wish artistes too are given some minimum support. I am trying to remain positive.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/this-phase-has-brought-my-family-even-closer-vivek-prakash/story-e3oGV1fddMmMDL8LIAOASP.html
20-05-2020||India||Cyclone Amphan begins landfall near Sunderbans in West Bengal as extremely severe cyclonic storm||Super Cyclone Amphan has begun making landfall near the Sunderbans in West Bengal with a wind speed of 155 to 165kmph gusting to 185kmph as an extremely severe cyclonic storm.It will cross the West Bengal-Bangladesh coast between Digha in West Bengal’s East Midnapore district and Hatiya Island in Bangladesh.“Yes it has begun landfall as an extremely severe cyclonic storm. Its trajectory is being tracked,” said M Rajeevan Nair, secretary, ministry of earth sciences.Watch | Super cyclone Amphan to hit West Bengal today, landfall likely near Sunderbans According to IMD’s glossary an extremely severe cyclonic storm is considered when wind speed is between 167 to 221kmph and a super cyclone is considered when wind speed is more than 222kmph.After the landfall the system is very likely to continue to move north-northeastwards, across Gangetic West Bengal & Bangladesh and weaken gradually. It is likely to maintain the intensity of Cyclonic Storm till the morning of 21st May and thereafter it will weaken into a Deep Depression over Bangladesh. Under its influence gale wind speed reaching 70-80kmph gusting to 90kmph likely over interior districts (Murshidabad & Nadia) of gangetic West Bengal during 20th night to 21st morning.As of 1pm, the super cyclone was lying 150km east-northeast of Paradip; 95km south-southeast of Digha, 90km nearly south of Sagar island and 260km west-southwest of Khepupara in Bangladesh, the IMD said.During landfall near Sagar Island, the intensity of the cyclone is likely to be 155 to 165kmph gusting up to 185kmph.The storm surge is expected to inundate low-lying areas of south and north 24 Parganas and parts of East Midnapore districts during landfall.Wind speed in Kolkata, and adjoining Hooghly and Howrah districts are likely to range between 110kmph to 120kmph gusting to 130kmph that may cause extensive damage in urban areas as well.Gale wind of 75 to 85kmph gusting to 95kmph is also likely to impact the north Odisha coast, including Jagatsignghpur, Bhadrak, Balasore, and Kendrapara districts, among others.The cyclone is expected to cause heavy to extremely heavy rainfall over Gangetic West Bengal and heavy to very heavy rainfall over north coastal Odisha on Wednesday. It will also cause heavy to very falls over sub-Himalayan West Bengal and Sikkim on Wednesday and Thursday and Meghalaya on Thursday.IMD is expecting extensive damage to all types of kutcha houses, some damage to old badly managed pucca structures; the potential threat from flying objects; uprooting of communication and power poles, disruption of rail/road link at several places, extensive damage to standing crops, plantations, orchards, falling of palm and coconut trees, uprooting of large bushy trees and large boats and ships may get torn from their moorings.National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) director-general SN Pradhan said on Tuesday that all precautionary measures have been taken and people from low-lying areas evacuated.“The biggest challenge is that we are facing two disasters together — coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak and cyclone Amphan. We’ve been spreading awareness about both Covid-19 and the cyclone while evacuating people. If a cyclone shelter has a capacity of 1,000, we can only accommodate half of that in a bid to maintain social distancing norms,” he added.“One of the most important factors is the storm surge that comes with the landfall. IMD and Indian National Centre for Ocean Information have forecasted a storm surge of about 4-6 metres above the tidal level. This could have an impact on the coastal areas and also raise the river levels,” said Roxy Mathew Koll, Climate scientist at Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cyclone-amphan-begins-landfall-as-extremely-severe-cyclonic-storm-bordering-on-very-severe/story-80DAZFsYHC5zJhvg9SWKyL.html

This is when the total number of people having been treated under the world’s largest public health insurance scheme reached 10 million since its launch in September 2018.  At least 3,000 persons have also been tested cashless for Covid-19 under the scheme.The National Health Authority (NHA), which is the implementing authority of the scheme, has empanelled about 1,500 additional hospitals under the scheme in the past month to meet the load of Covid-19 patients, the authority announced on Wednesday.Also read: Maharashtra reports highest single-day recovery of Covid-19 patients“We want to be prepared in case there is a surge in cases. As of now, the public sector is taking care of much of the load but if there’s an unusual increase then we would need private sector hospitals also to chip in. We are currently on a drive to add more hospitals to the list. We have created separate Covid-19 treatment packages also as treating these patients requires isolation, PPE kits, extra manpower etc,” said Indu Bhushan, chief executive officer, NHA (Ayushman Bharat).    The authority is in the process of also adding private laboratories for Covid-19 testing that have been approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research. The rate packages are being used from the already existing category related to respiratory illnesses, severe acute respiratory infection, influenza-like illness with aggravated symptoms etc. India currently has 61,149 active Covid-19 cases.Also read: PM Modi lauds Ayushman Bharat scheme as beneficiaries cross 1 crore-mark“Responding to the outbreak of Covid-19, the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has made the testing and treatment for Covid-19 free of cost under the AB PMJAY scheme for all its 53 crore beneficiaries. 2,132 people have availed the treatment or are currently undergoing treatment for Covid-19 under AB PMJAY in the country,” read the National Health Authority (NHA) statement.    The NHA teams are also reaching out to its elderly (above 60 years of age) and other high-risk category beneficiaries (who recently received treatment) to check if any of them has Covid-19 symptoms and needs testing through its call entre that is handled by about 700 dedicated operators. Close to 30 million calls have already been made to the scheme beneficiaries through this call centre.“Our aim was to call up all of the beneficiaries who are above 60 years, recently received treatment and those who have co-morbidities because these are the people at high risk. Our call centre is running 24x7,” said Bhushan.The call centre is also being used to get in touch with people identified at potential risk of contracting the infection by the Aarogya Setu mobile application, to caution them so that they strictly follow the preventive measures. Close to 6 lakh people have been contacted and 15,000 teleconsultations have been facilitated with doctors in the past couple of months.The NHA has empanelled 21,565 hospitals under the scheme, of which 1,385 hospitals have been empanelled across the country since April 1. A total of 1,310 hospitals are through the regular empanelment route and remaining 75 under express empanelment. Of the total hospitals on board, nearly 58% per cent are private hospitals.“To increase the number of hospitals providing Covid-19 treatment and to ensure continued treatment such as haemodialysis, cardiovascular procedures, and chemotherapy for non-Covid-19 critical illnesses, the NHA has started an express empanelment mechanism.”The NHA is also launching a hospital ranking dashboard to rank empanelled hospitals on the basis of beneficiaries’ feedback. “The ranking will help the NHA to take evidence-based decision-making for enhancing the quality measures and indicators of healthcare delivery across all empanelled facilities to further improve the beneficiaries’ experience,” it said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-000-under-treatment-3-000-tested-free-for-covid-19-under-ayushman-bharat-scheme/story-ROgYn2caqy6gnMMaYDdxQL.html

20-05-2020||India||Tungnath dham, lord Kedar’s 3rd abode in pristine Uttarakhand hills opens with first prayer offered in PM Modi’s name||The portals of Tungnath shrine, the third temple of Lord Kedar, opened in Rudraprayag district at 11:30 am on Wednesday with priests maintaining physical distancing. Soon after the opening rituals, first prayers at the shrine were offered on behalf of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Tungnath shrine is considered to be the world’s highest temple dedicated to Lord Shiva, located at a height of 12,070 feet above the sea level.The palanquin carrying the deity reached the shrine from Chopta in Rudraprayag at 9 am on Wednesday after it left from Makkumath village, the winter abode of the deity on May 18, following an Utsav Doli.All priests and temple workers wore masks and ensured proper physical distancing during the opening ceremony in the presence of officials from the Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board.As soon as the shrine’s portals were opened, rituals like Samadhi Puja, Rudrabhishek and Jalabhishek were carried out.With the opening of the portals of Tungnath shrine, all five temples of Lord Shiva in the state have been opened for the summer season. However, given the coronavirus pandemic, Char Dham Yatra has not started in the state this year. Satpal Maharaj, tourism and culture minister in Uttarakhand, said the Char Dham yatra is expected to begin soon after the epidemic situation is brought under control.Harish Gaur, media in-charge of Chardham Devasthanam Management Board said that all the shrines including the four holy shrines of Kedarnath, Badrinath, Gangotri and Yamunotri have been opened successfully in the state, with all priests strictly following physical distancing norms and wearing masks at all times.Tungnath temple is not only popular with devotees but also a major tourist attraction as it is surrounded by the lush green alpine meadows.Tungnath, 3 km uphill from Chopta, the last motorable road, is a beautiful and popular tourist destination.On a steep climb of about 2 km from Tungnath temple, lies Chandrashila, a famous tourist attraction that commands a breathtaking view of snow-clad peaks of Nanda Devi, Chaukhamba, Panchachuli, Bandarpoonch, Kedarnath and Neelkanth.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tungnath-dham-lord-kedar-s-3rd-abode-in-pristine-uttarakhand-hills-opens-with-first-prayer-offered-in-pm-modi-s-name/story-2jKbrBZim0fpVncIRQNcQK.html
20-05-2020||India||Ladakh sector’s Galwan Valley and its history in Sino-India relations||The Chinese government often says the border dispute with India is a legacy of history. The dispute has influenced bilateral ties between New Delhi and Beijing for nearly 70 years despite dozens of rounds of negotiations over the years.Archival documents from 1962 reveal tit-for-tat allegations by India and China on soldiers trespassing in Ladakh sector’s Galwan Valley -- where the most recent standoff took place. The Galwan Valley region, which China claims is part of Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, is part of the 3,488 km long border dispute.Through the summer of 1962, barely weeks before the two neighbours fought a war, India and China went back-and-forth on their troops trespassing across the border in the Galwan Valley region.Several letters were exchanged between the foreign ministries through embassies in New Delhi and Beijing.The rhetoric flew thick-and-fast and within months both countries were fighting the border war of 1962.The language in those letters exchanged remain almost identical to official exchanges now.In a letter from the Chinese foreign ministry handed over to the Indian embassy in Beijing on July 23, 1962, Beijing laid out its allegations.“According to frontier guards in Sinkiang, (Xinjiang) China, there occurred recently another two serious cases of Indian troops intruding into Chinese territory and firing provocatively at Chinese frontier guards,” excerpts from the letter said.It continued: “Several dozens of Indian troops intruded recently into Chinese territory south of the Galwan river had reached a place…where they attempted to entrench themselves permanently. At 17:35 hours on July 19, the said Indian troops unwarrantedly fired provocatively at Chinese patrol nearby. The Chinese patrol took no action against the provocation”.“If the Chinese guards had not remained cool and exercised self-restrain, the above two new cases of provocation would most probably have led to armed clashes. The Chinese Government hereby lodges a serious protest with the Government of India against the two cases,” the letter said.The Indian government responded swiftly.In a letter to the Chinese embassy, August 3, 1962, the ministry of external affairs (MEA) rejected the allegations.“The Government of India has carefully investigated all the three allegations and has found them to be without any basis whatsoever…The GOI notes in this connection that all the three areas referred to by the Chinese government lie well within India territory. It is clear from this that such intrusions as have occurred, have in fact been committed by Chinese forces and not by Indian troops.”The Indian border defence forces have, despite provocation by Chinese forces throughout shown considerable patience and self-restraint.”“While rejecting the Chinese note, the Government of India would once again press upon the Chinese Government the urgent necessity of issuing immediate instructions to all Chinese forces to desist from provocative action of any kind and to withdraw from Indian territory”.The very next day, on August 4, 1962, China shot off another dispatch to India.“In disregard of the repeated protests of the Chinese government, the Indian side has not only refused to withdraw its troops which have intruded into the Galwan river valley in Sinkiang, China, and menacingly surrounded the Chinese frontier guards there but set up another military strongpoint on Chinese territory south of Galwan river…,” excerpt from the letter said.India dismissed the allegations on August 8 in a letter to the Chinese embassy. “...There is no truth whatsoever in these allegations. On the contrary whenever an instance of this nature has arisen, it has invariably been due to Chinese forces intruding in Indian territory and shooting at Indian border forces. The Government of India has protested about two such incidents…On both occasions the Indian forces exercises great self-restrain and did not return the Chinese fire,” said part of the letter.Similar exchanges continued for weeks until the 1962 Sino-Indian war, the legacy of which will continue to shadow ties for a long time to come.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/when-india-and-china-clashed-in-ladakh-s-galwan-valley-weeks-before-1962-war/story-kjcsT7ILMvbizrOriFuI7L.html
20-05-2020||India||Cyclone Amphan will carry winds with speed greater than Vande Bharat Express, say experts||The extent of devastation that Cyclone Amphan is likely to cause in the coastal blocks and riverine areas of West Bengal will depend much on the landfall time and its synchronisation with the tidal timings, experts have warned.With the new moon scheduled on May 22, scientists said that the ‘spring tide’ phase - when average tidal ranges are higher - has already started. Then there is going to be the diurnal high tide that occurs approximately every 12 hours. Over and above these, there would be storm surge that would be triggered by Amphan itself.“Together these three could trigger huge waves in the rivers and sea that could create massive destruction. Mud embankments could collapse and sea water could gush in. Large areas could get inundated,” said KJ Ramesh, former director general of the India Meteorological Department (IMD).The IMD has warned that extremely severe cyclone Amphan, located less than 100 km south of the Bengal coast around 12:30 pm, could hit the coast somewhere between Digha in south Bengal and Hatiya Island in Bangladesh with wind speed gusting up to 185 km per hour - the top speed of Vande Bharat Express, India’s fastest train.“Storm surge of about 4-5 metres above the astronomical tide (spring tide and neap tide coinciding with new moon and full moon) is likely to inundate the low lying areas of South 24 Parganas and North 24 Parganas,” the IMD has warned in its bulletin.On Wednesday, the first high tide at Diamond Harbour in South 24 Parganas was recorded around 10 am. The next high tide will peak around 10:18 pm. The low tide is around 5:36 pm. The IMD has said that the storm is expected to hit in the afternoon or evening. Rain and gusty winds have already started battering the coast. “When the storm makes a landfall, the winds will blow in a north to south direction. If at that time there is high tide, then water will gush in from south to north and there would be head-on collision between the water and wind. This will bring more devastation,” said Kalyan Rudra, chairman of the West Bengal Pollution Control Board and a noted expert on rivers.West Bengal had witnessed this phenomenon during cyclone Aila, which had hit the Sunderbans in May 2009. It was high tide at that time. There were massive waves, the river embankments got damaged and sea water gushed into the villages resulting in heavy loss of life and property.“Bulbul, which struck in November 2019, also created damage because of its wind power. But the damage caused by waves was not much and the embankments didn’t break because there was low tide at that time. On Wednesday I heard that despite there was a low tide in the early morning the river water didn’t go down much in the Sunderbans because storm water was gushing in with the approaching storm,” said Tuhin Ghosh, director of School of Oceanographic Studies at Jadavpur University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cyclone-amphan-will-carry-winds-with-speed-greater-than-vande-bharat-express-say-experts/story-VeDoqrKwIwQrVkxPG2JrKL.html
20-05-2020||India||UP govt obstructing help to stranded migrant workers: Congress||The Congress alleged on Wednesday the Uttar Pradesh government is obstructing efforts to help migrant workers by not allowing in 500 buses, and urged chief minister Yogi Adityanath to enable the labourers to safely reach their homes.The party said the buses, which have been standing at the Uttar Pradesh border for the past six days, will remain till 4 pm on Wednesday.The issue has triggered a war of words between the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress, with both sides accusing each other of playing politics with the plight of migrant workers.“One is astounded, one cannot understand - if it were not tragic for humanity, it would be comic. How is it that the state government is sitting and doing nothing and not letting anyone else do something, and also obstructing any help for the migrant workers,” Congress spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi told reporters via video conference.“Will the Uttar Pradesh government stand up and explain to the nation? For the last six days, especially the last two days and even as we speak, about 500 buses are standing at the Uttar Pradesh border. How is it that you will not allow to ferry the migrant workers of UP and Bihar? This is the cheapest form of politics,” he said.Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and the BJP government are at loggerheads over her plan to send 1,000 buses to help transport migrant workers from Uttar Pradesh to other states. The offer was made on Saturday, and accepted on Monday. But by Tuesday evening, the Uttar Pradesh government said only 879 of the 1,000 vehicles were buses, and the rest three-wheelers and other vehicles, triggering angry reactions from the Congress.“In its own statement, the state government has admitted 879 buses in the list have been found alright. The administration (Agra) has stopped our 500 buses for hours, while 300 buses are reaching the Delhi border. Allow the 879 buses to run,” Priyanka Gandhi tweeted.“UP government has crossed all the limits. When there is an opportunity to do away with political differences and serve helpless migrant labourers it has caused all the hindrances. @myogiadityanath ji you can use BJP flags and your posters on these buses, but don’t reject our feelings of service,” she said in another tweet.Late on Tuesday evening, Uttar Pradesh Police booked Priyanka Gandhi’s private secretary Sandip Singh and state Congress chief Ajay Kumar Lallu for allegedly providing “misleading” information about the buses.“It is still not too late and I beseech with folded hands, like Priyankaji said, if you are so concerned about politics, please put your name or party banner but at least use the help we are providing,” Singhvi said.“I beseech with folded hands, if the Adityanath government cannot help the migrants, let Priyankaji and the Congress party help the migrants,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-govt-obstructing-help-to-stranded-migrant-workers-congress/story-aJsL3AtpTmpsFNaOSpshHN.html

As fire brigade personnel proceeded, they faced hurdle with 22 trees uprooted along the stretch leading to the village. Braving strong winds and squally weather, they cleared the road and ferried the woman in the service vehicle,” he said.The woman went into labour midway through the journey, Dash said, adding, the fire service personnel assisted her as she gave birth to the child.As cyclone “Amphan” hurtled towards the coast, heavy downpour coupled with high velocity winds pounded coastal Odisha, uprooting trees and flattening fragile structures, officials said.More than 1.25 lakh people have so far been evacuated from low-lying coastal areas and the process of evacuation was still underway in some places like Balasore on Wednesday morning, Special Relief Commissioner (SRC) P K Jena said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/woman-delivers-baby-in-fire-service-vehicle-as-cyclone-amphan-pounds-odisha/story-YCXStf2e2BQYF8s1WkKaMM.html

Our revenue has come down 95 per cent over the past 2 months. Most importantly, this crisis has affected the livelihoods of millions of our drivers and their families across India and our international geographies,” he said.The company has decided to downsize and “let go” of 1,400 employees, Aggarwal added. He said this will be a one-time exercise and will be complete by the end of this week for the India Mobility business, and by the end of next week for Ola foods and Ola Financial Services.“No more COVID-related cuts will be done after this exercise,” he noted.Aggarwal explained that more companies are expected to have a large number of employees work from home, air travel will be limited to essential trips and vacations being put off for better times.“...the impact of this crisis is definitely going to be long-drawn for us. The world is not going to revert to the pre-COVID era anytime soon. Social distancing, anxiety, and an abundance of caution will be the operating principles for everyone,” he said.In the past few weeks, a number of tech-led businesses like Uber, Zomato and Swiggy have announced layoffs as the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown dried up demand and ravaged businesses.Zomato has laid off 13 per cent of its 4,000-staff, while Swiggy said it will let go off 1,100 employees. Uber is laying off 3,000 people globally and the move is expected to impact India operations as well.Last year, Ola had undertaken a restructuring exercise of its 4,500-workforce that resulted in about 350 employees being laid off.Aggarwal, in his mail, said the crisis necessitated the need to conserve cash aggressively so that it is able to invest in opportunities in the future.“While we restructure our organisation to the new realities of our business, we are also going to recommit ourselves to strengthening our operational excellence.“We are increasing our investments and adding people capabilities in R&D as a group, through this crisis to double down on innovation and engineering...This crisis is accelerating macro trends of digital commerce and clean mobility, and our businesses are well-positioned to leverage these macro trends well,” he said.The company has, in the past, spoken of its aim to turn profitable and go public in the next few years.Aggarwal said the impacted employees will receive a minimum financial payout of 3 months of their fixed salary, irrespective of the notice period. “Employees who have spent significantly more time with us will be eligible for higher payouts depending on tenure,” he said.Also, all eligible ESOPs will vest forward to the closest quarter and for those who may not have completed a year, as an exception, Ola will enable pro-rated vesting for the period of time spent with the company, he added.“All affected employees will be able to continue using their medical, life and accident insurance cover for themselves and their families up to December 31, 2020 or the start of their next job whichever is earlier, to help minimise the financial burden of health and other risks in a time like this,” Aggarwal said.The company has also decided to offer medical insurance for up to 2 parents (or in-laws) to each employee. This insurance will cover parents for all pre-existing ailments up to the age of 90, for a sum of Rs 2 lakhs.“While we have made every possible effort to accommodate as many affected team members in open roles in our other group companies, we are rallying the support of the Ola Talent Acquisition team to help with outplacement support for as many people and in helping find suitable roles for them outside of Ola,” he said.In addition to this, we are also allowing all company-issued laptops (primary work devices) to be retained by affected employees, he added.Aggarwal said all members of Ola’s extended leadership team have taken significant salary cuts.“We had all hoped in the beginning that this would be a short-lived crisis and that its impact would be temporary.“Over the past couple of months, all members of our extended leadership team have taken significant salary cuts to be able to help the organisation delay tougher people decisions as we waited for the situation to evolve. But unfortunately, it’s not been a short crisis,” he said. Aggarwal said economic activity returns, so will the need for mobility.“Formats will evolve depending on context - personal, shared, public transit, or the niches in between. This pandemic has only highlighted the need for each of us to have safe and reliable mobility solutions. As economic activity returns, so will the need for mobility, but the paradigm will have changed,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ola-to-layoff-1-400-employees-as-covid-19-pandemic-hits-revenues-says-ceo/story-AI809A5X5Q9RbKYgAxLhbN.html
20-05-2020||India||Cyclone Amphan to hit Bengal at 4 pm, CM Mamata to monitor from secretariat||Cyclone ‘Amphan’, one of the worst cyclones over the Bay of Bengal, lay centred about 170 km south of West Bengal’s Digha on Wednesday.

I would not be wrong in saying that these people had sacrificed themselves and their posts for the state. So, for this reason, all of them are in consideration for the candidature,” the state BJP President told ANI. The by-polls have been necessitated as seats fell vacant after the sitting MLAs resigned. The party is already gearing up for by-elections in 24 assembly constituencies. MLAs considered close to Jyotiraditya Scindia had resigned and later crossed over to the BJP resulting in the fall of Kamal Nath government in the state.The nomination for tickets for the by-elections will be approved by the Central leadership of the party, he added.Despite lockdown, the party has begun preparations for these by-polls. According to Sharma, online meetings in all constituencies are being conducted. Present in these meeting were 20-25 people including former candidates, district, mandal level leaders and other prominent leaders in every constituency. “We have strengthened the organisation online. Shakti kendra and booth level meetings have begun. We work round the year. We will reach people through online mediums and door to door campaign will be done by keeping physical distancing and following other health measures,” said Sharma. The by-polls are expected to take place in September. Sharma praised BJP workers in the state and called them Corona warriors. “I take pride in saying that BJP workers are not less than any Corona warriors. They have served people while endangering their lives. One of our corporator from Ujjain contracted and died while serving people. We have ensured that migrants reaching or crossing over the state will get food and essentials,” claimed Sharma. On the announcement of his new team in the state, Sharma said, “ it will be announced soon. It got delayed as we all are busy with COVID-19 relief work. It may get announced by the end of this month.” (ANI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mlas-who-sacrificed-to-remove-congress-govt-will-be-contenders-for-tickets-in-by-polls-madhya-pradesh-bjp-chief/story-zdfOuYn8dYNqAm5jdMCRXJ.html
20-05-2020||India||Over 1 crore availed free treatment under Ayushman Bharat so far: Report||Over one crore people have availed treatment worth around Rs 13,412 crore for free in hospitals across the country under the Ayushman Bharat health insurance scheme since its launch in September 2018, officials said.Also, 2,132 patients have availed or are currently undergoing treatment for Covid-19 under the Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojna (AB-PMJAY) in the country, the National Health Authority (NHA), which is responsible for implementing the scheme, said on Wednesday.Responding to the Covid-19 outbreak, the Union Ministry of Health has made testing and treatment for the coronavirus infection free under the insurance scheme for its 53 crore beneficiaries.More than 21,565 hospitals, including private hospitals, have been empanelled under the programme so far, the NHA said in its statement.Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Chhattisgarh, Kerala and Rajasthan have emerged as the top performing states, providing the highest number of treatments under the scheme, it said.Orthopaedics, cardiology, cardio-thoracic and vascular surgery, radiation oncology and urology have remained as the top specialties under which treatment is sought.Treatment packages like single stent (medicated, inclusive of diagnostic angiogram), hip fracture internal fixation and rehabilitation, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), double stent (medicated, inclusive of diagnostic angiogram) and total knee replacement have emerged as the top tertiary procedures, the statement said.This is a milestone achievement for the Ayushman Bharat PMJAY scheme on providing 1 crore treatments to patients from the country’s poorest households since its launch less than two years ago. These treatments worth Rs 13,412 crore have been provided through a growing network of 21,565 public and private empanelled hospitals, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said in the statement.“The government of India is making persistent efforts to expand testing and make treatment of Covid-19 available for free to all 53 crore beneficiaries of the Ayushman Bharat PM-JAY, further strengthening government’s resolve, scope and capability to move towards universal health coverage,” Vardhan said.To mark this milestone, the first edition of Arogya Dhara, a series of webinars created as an open platform for discussion on topical issues of public health, is being planned to be held on May 21.  The webinar titled “Ayushman Bharat: 1 crore treatments and beyond” will have a keynote address by Vardhan and he is expected to launch a ‘Ask Ayushman’ chat bot on WhatsApp, a 24*7 AI-enabled assistant to provide information on various aspect of the AB PM-JAY scheme such as its benefits, features, process of making an e-card, locating the nearest empanelled hospital, sharing feedback and the process of lodging a grievance, it said.One of the key features of the chat bot is that it is able to comprehend and respond in Hindi and English languages and it also provides text-to-speech feature for the users and can be universally used on all major social media platforms, the statement added.The minister will also launch a hospital ranking dashboard, which is a significant step to rank empanelled hospitals on the basis of beneficiaries’ feedback, it said.The ranking will help NHA take evidence-based decisions for enhancing quality measures and indicators of healthcare delivery across all empanelled facilities to further improve the beneficiaries’ experiences.Apart from these, a Hindi version of the Ayushman Bharat PM-JAY website will also be launched. The main objective of this is to effectively connect with the masses and to empower them with access to right information through a user-friendly medium, the NHA said in the statement.Dr Indu Bhushan, CEO of AB-PMJAY and NHA, said, “We are marking this milestone of 1 crore treatment under AB-PMJAY at a time when the whole country is reeling under the Covid-19 pandemic. We have utilised this period to leverage our IT systems and network of private sector stakeholders to support the government’s preparedness and response in the form of managing the national Covid-19 helpline 1075 by conducting thousands of outbound calls to coronavirus-infected patients and their families.” “We have also further strengthened our network of hospitals and service capabilities to ensure continued service delivery to non-COVID patients under the scheme,” he said.NHA’s state-of-the-art call centre is also being used as a Covid-19 helpline. More than 600-700 dedicated agents are answering calls by citizens round the clock.The National Health Authority has made calls to disseminate precaution advisory to beneficiaries of AB PM-JAY who are at a higher risk of contracting the disease such as those above 60 years of age and have recently received treatment under PM-JAY or those having co-morbidities.  The AB-PMJAY is the flagship scheme of the government that provides a cover of up to Rs 5 lakhs per family per year for secondary and tertiary care hospitalisation to over 10.74 crore poor and vulnerable families (about 53 crore beneficiaries). AB PM-JAY provides cashless and paperless access to services for the beneficiaries at the point of service.Under this scheme, there are 1,578 health benefit packages with defined rates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-1-crore-availed-free-treatment-under-ayushman-bharat-so-far-report/story-8lFxwgxKiNurTws5d7jkjM.html

Here is what we discussed. https://t.co/vsUOEEo5pMThe prime minister also spoke about the benefits of the scheme and lauded the healthcare workers associated with it . He said that one of the biggest benefits of the scheme is “portability” as the beneficiaries “can get top quality and affordable medical care not only where they are registered but also in other parts of India.”  One of the biggest benefits of Ayushman Bharat is portability. Beneficiaries can get top quality and affordable medical care not only where they registered but also in other parts of India. This helps those who work away from home or registered at a place where they don’t belong.He appreciated the efforts of doctors, nurses among others in ensuring the scheme helps the ‘poor and downtrodden’. I appreciate our doctors, nurses, healthcare workers and all others associated with Ayushman Bharat. Their efforts have made it the largest healthcare programme in the world. This initiative has won the trust of several Indians, especially the poor and downtrodden.Prime Minister Modi had launched the Centre’s flagship health insurance programme Ayushman Bharat Scheme on September 23 in Ranchi that aims to provide Rs 5 lakh hospitalisation cover to up to 107.4 million poor and vulnerable families.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-lauds-ayushman-bharat-scheme-as-beneficiaries-cross-1-crore-mark/story-nJcuxIMfWSarjB0ftGETiI.html

A lot, says Rajiv Gandhi (35) of Marayur in hilly Idukki district in Kerala, who shares his name with the former prime minister.Rajiv’s grandfather Megavarnan was an ardent supporter of the Congress party and named his newborn grandson after the stalwart in 1985. Though he basked in the glory in school, Rajiv soon started facing problems. His friends and others used to bully him. He took it in his stride but had to often explain to people how he got the name.Ahead of the death anniversary of former PM Rajiv Gandhi on May 21, the man from Idukki says Gandhi’s early death was a big loss to the country.“I read he was a good leader and started computer in the country. Sad, the country lost him at a young age,” he said.Though he’s now known by his first name, in all official records he is still Rajiv Gandhi. When the former PM was assassinated in 1991, he was six but still remembers that his grandfather and others cried that day.Not good in his studies, Rajiv started doing farm jobs after Class 12. A good farm hand, he often goes to the Marayur forest nursery as a temporary worker. The “name game” is nothing new in plantation areas of Idukki - just walk around he you can see many Gandhis, Nehrus, Napoleans and others.On the 150th birth anniversary of the Father of the Nation Mahathma Gandhi last year, Idukki district Congress committee had arranged a gathering of people carrying the name Gandhi. At least 100 ‘Gandhis’ had responded to the invitation and later on popular demand they also included Nehrus. Hence, hundreds of Gandhis and Nehrus rubbed shoulders on October 2 last year and shared their experiences. The vice-president of the Kerala unit of Congress, A K Mani, said many plantation workers still love to name their children after national heroes.Keralites’ love for names of Russian leaders and other sports legends are well known. You can meet many Breshnev, Khrushchev, Lenin, Olga and Pushkin in the interiors. Every year, Russian cultural centre in Thiruvananthapuram organises a meet of such people.“Earlier, party supporters were mad over Communist legends. As the ideology declined the world over this trend is also on the wane,” said V Lenin, a teastall owner in Thiruvananthapuram. Agreed senior journalist M J Babu, hailing from hill destination Munnar. “Keralites are nostalgic about their great leaders. So many eponyms are still around,” he said.In north Kerala, where people breathe soccer, many still love to name the newborn after their soccer greats. At one point, religious leaders were forced to issue a ‘fatwa’ in Malappuram to rein in crazy soccer fans. In Kozhikode, a Muslim League leader had named his daughter Brasilia, capital of Latin American country Brazil. Brasilia was councillor of the Kozhikode Corporation and is now helping her businessman husband run an apparel unit in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajiv-gandhi-from-kerala-s-idukki-remembers-former-pm-ahead-of-his-death-anniversary/story-rdRWYP47LmVv3lnNlgbLII.html

The cyclone is lying around 110 km south by southeast of the port town.Though the ground zero of Amphan is expected to be somewhere between Sagar islands in neighbouring West Bengal and Bangladesh’s Hatia islands later on Wednesday afternoon, the cyclone, strongest over the Bay of Bengal since the 1999 supercyclone, has started causing widespread destruction in coastal Odisha, uprooting trees and electric poles in Jagatsinghpur and Kendrapara districts.Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) officials said though cyclone Amphan was moving at around 20kmph on Tuesday, it has slowed down to 11kmph over the last six hours. “It’s expected to move along the track that we had anticipated.

Chandbali witnessed winds blowing at 74kmph and Balasore at 61kmph.At Balasore’s Talasari beach, fishermen ran for cover as gusty winds lashed their boats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cyclone-amphan-brings-heavy-winds-and-rain-to-odisha-coast/story-Oz6AGrElQ0BI9Z4B5KkChM.html
20-05-2020||India||Surat’s diamond industry starts operations with reduced workforce||After government gave relaxation for opening the industries while taking necessary precautions during the fourth phase of lockdown, the diamond industry in the city opened on Tuesday.However, the industries are operating with a reduced workforce. Nilesh Bodke, who is associated with the diamond industry said that this sector is resilient and will overcome the impact of Covid-19 lockdown in 2-3 months. “The diamond market opened today, after the announcement of the state government, but it will take at least 2-3 months for the industry to start its functions normally. Majority of the labourers who work in these industries have returned back to their villages and will not come back in the near future. On the other hand, the monsoon season is about to start and these labourers will most probably return after ploughing their land in the villages,” Bodke told ANI.“The market in Mumbai has not started operating yet, which makes it difficult for the industry in Surat to function. There are no options to export or import the diamonds and hence the industry cannot function normally in the given scenario,” he added.However, Bodke expressed hope that the situation would improve gradually.“The situation will improve in the future. The workers in the diamond industry are very hard-working and do not shy away from putting more than 12 hours if required,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/surat-s-diamond-industry-starts-operations-with-reduced-workforce/story-rTChKm9wPC1oTcbGyAeqdJ.html
20-05-2020||India||As Amphan barrels towards India, a look at what makes cyclones deadly||India and Bangladesh evacuated around half a million people out of the way of the most powerful storm in a decade ahead of its landfall on Wednesday amid fears of heavy damage to houses and crops and disruption of road, rail and power links.Approaching from the Bay of Bengal, Amphan is expected to make the landfall between West Bengal and Bangladesh with winds gusting up to 185 kmph. The wind speed packed in by Cyclone Amphan is equivalent of a category 5 hurricane.Watch | What does cyclone Amphan have to do with covid-19?The cyclone will generate sea waves as high as a two-storey house that could swamp mud dwellings along the coast, uproot communication towers and inundate roads and rail tracks.Bangladesh authorities fear that Amphan will be the most powerful storm front since Cyclone Sidr devastated the country in 2007, killing about 3,500 people and causing billions of dollars in damage.Here is a look at what makes cyclones deadly:• Cyclones are low-pressure systems that form over warm tropical waters, with gale force winds near the centre. The winds can extend hundreds of kilometres (miles) from the eye of the storm. Sucking up vast quantities of water, they often produce torrential rains and flooding resulting in major loss of life and property damage. Tropical cyclones (hurricanes) are the most powerful weather events on Earth, according to NASA.• Cyclones can unleash catastrophic storm surges - tsunami-like flooding - when they make landfall. The large swells move faster than the cyclone and are sometimes spotted up to 1,000 kilometres ahead of a major storm. The surge can extend for dozens of kilometres inland.• Experts say that one of the reasons for cyclones to be so devastating is the favourable conditions in Bay of Bengal, like high sea surface temperatures. The tropical cyclone season in the Bay of Bengal and neighbouring Arabian Sea has two peaks around May and November, according to the World Meteorological Organisation. The cyclones can form in the western Pacific Ocean and travel in a northwest direction before arriving in the Bay of Bengal. Some reach the southeastern coast of India but others divert northeast and move up to West Bengal and Odisha states. • Studies suggest a warming climate could bring more destructive cyclones as there would be extra heat in the oceans and atmosphere, although such systems could also become less frequent. Rising sea levels could boost storm surges from cyclones, making them even more deadly and destructive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-amphan-barrels-towards-india-a-look-at-what-makes-cyclones-deadly/story-znY8qNlDqi22PX2seJd6CP.html

Lockdown 4.0 is scheduled to end on May 31.A new study has found that higher temperature and humidity may do little to arrest the spread of the coronavirus pandemic adding to a growing body of literature that indicates that the correlation between local climate conditions and virus transmission is weak.The study by scientists at Princeton University and the US National Institutes of Health also suggested the lack of sizeable immunity to the Sars-Cov-2 virus and the speed of the pathogen ensured that climate and humidity had limited impact on transmission. It was published in the journal Science on Monday.Also read| Covid-19: What you need to know todayA batch of studies during the initial surge of the pandemic had held out hope that drier and colder climates are more suited to the virus, and that the weather in tropical countries may hobble the spread to the disease.Previous research from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the US National Academies of Sciences (NAS) also say while there is some evidence that Sars-CoV-2 transmits less efficiently in higher ambient temperature and humidity, this does not lead to a significant decrease in disease spread without major interventions, such as personal protection and social distancing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-biggest-single-day-spike-india-records-over-5-611-covid-19-cases/story-akdXPe54kIwGnmfLnMmgzO.html

20-05-2020||India||Bois Locker Room: Response sought on plea against groups||The Delhi high court on Tuesday sought the Centre’s response over a plea seeking directions to it to ensure social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram remove illegal groups such as Bois Locker Room for the safety and security of children.Bois Locker Room, an online chat group that made light of gang-rape and trivialised sexual assault, came to light this month and triggered outrage.A bench of Justices Rajiv Sahai Endlaw and Sangita Dhingra Sehgal issued notices to the Union home, information technology and finance ministries while also seeking to know the stand of Facebook, Google and Twitter by the next date of hearing on July 14.The court was hearing a plea moved by former Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh ideologue K N Govindacharya “highlighting the unlawful nature of illegal groups” like Bois Locker Room. “Due to the negativity, fake news and illegal content many young lives are destroyed. Such groups are criminal in nature and do not deserve any protection of free or creative speech,” Govindacharya’s lawyer Gaurav Pathak said. He added Bois Locker Room on Instagram shows “one of the vilest forms of social media”.The Centre’s standing counsel Anurag Ahluwalia accepted the notice on behalf of the ministries.“We have zero tolerance for any behaviour or material that exploits young people online and action content violating our community guidelines and policies. We will not be able to comment further, as the matter is sub judice,” a Facebook spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bois-locker-room-response-sought-on-plea-against-groups/story-JKkQ6Sq7EZYVrrYsXZZslK.html
20-05-2020||India||Tensions simmer along LAC as India, China step up vigil||Tensions continue to simmer in Ladakh and Sikkim sectors of the Line of Actual Control (LAC), where India and China have deployed additional troops, days after scores of Indian and Chinese soldiers were involved in a tense face-off along the India-China boundary.People familiar with developments, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said both sides have deployed additional troops, especially in Galwan Valley region of the Ladakh sector. India bolstered troop levels after the Chinese side brought in reinforcements, they said. China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has pitched close to 100 tents and erected temporary positions in Galwan Valley as part of efforts to establish a presence there, the people said. It has also strengthened its presence in the area opposite Demchok, they said.Responding to a question from Hindustan Times, China’s foreign ministry, in a statement in Mandarin, said the Indian Army was “obstructing normal patrols and operations of Chinese border troops”. While there was no official word from the India side on Tuesday, the external affairs ministry previously said it remained committed to maintaining peace along the border with China and noted that such incidents could have been avoided if there was a common perception about the boundary.Tensions flared after scores of soldiers from the two countries clashed near Pangong lake in eastern Ladakh on the night of May 5-6, while about 150 soldiers were involved in another standoff in north Sikkim on May 9. Several soldiers from both sides were injured in these confrontations.The people cited above said there had been no more confrontations after both sides activated border management mechanisms but the situation continues to be tense, especially in Galwan Valley. The Indian Army responded to the Chinese build-up by deploying additional troops, they added.“In the past, the Chinese side usually patrolled this area but now they’re entrenched in the region,” said one of the people cited above. The face-off began after the Chinese side objected to the construction of a road, north of Pangong lake, located well within Indian territory, he added.The statement from China’s foreign ministry said: “China’s position on the China-India border issue is consistent and clear. The Chinese border troops are committed to maintaining peace and tranquillity in the China-India border areas and have exercised great restraint.”The troops, the statement said, “will firmly safeguard China’s territorial sovereignty and security”. The tensions with China come against the backdrop of an escalating India-Nepal border row. Nepal has protested against India’s construction of an 80-km road leading to Lipulekh, which is claimed by Kathmandu. New Delhi has rejected the protest and said the road, built to facilitate pilgrims travelling to Kailash Mansarovar in China, is “completely within the territory of India”. Nepal was also irked when Indian Army chief Gen Manoj Mukund Naravane, without naming China, said Kathmandu was protesting against the road at someone else’s behest.China’s state-run Global Times daily reported that the troop deployments in Galwan Valley constituted the “strongest military response to India’s illegal trespassing incident along the border since the Doklam standoff”. The 73-day faceoff at Doklam in 2017 took bilateral ties to a fresh low and relations were put on an even keel only after the first India-China informal summit at Wuhan in 2018.A second person familiar with developments said the strategic guidance from the top leadership of both sides for better management of the border did not appear to have percolated to the ground level on the Chinese side. Last week, the Indian Army chief Navarane described border face-offs as “temporary and short”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tensions-simmer-along-lac-as-india-china-step-up-vigil/story-vpKqtZJm1nAOM3qk9t20FO.html
20-05-2020||India||Chhattisgarh to launch Rajiv Gandhi Nyay Yojana for farmers on May 21, former PM’s death anniversary||The Chhattisgarh government will launch a scheme to ensure “minimum income availability” to farmers of the state through direct bank transfer on the death anniversary of former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi May 21.Under the Rajiv Gandhi Kisan Nyay Yojana, based on registered area and area under cultivation during Kharif crop season 2019, Rs 10,000 per acre will be deposited in the bank accounts of farmers as agriculture assistance grant for sowing crops such as paddy, maize and sugarcane, officials said.According to the government, at least 19 lakh farmers will benefit from the scheme, for which the state government had allocated Rs 5,756 crore in the budget 2020-21.The money will be given to the farmers in four instalments.In November 2019, the Congress government had decided to procure paddy at the Centre’s fixed price of Rs 1,835 per quintal and said it will pay the difference between the central price and Rs 2,500 per quintal promised by the Congress in its manifesto for the assembly elections in 2018. A five-member committee was constituted to study how a benefit of Rs 2,500 per quintal could be ensured to the farmers.“The committee recommended that Rs 10,000 per acre should be given to farmers who sold paddy under MSP and added the benefit should also be provided for maize and sugarcane crops,” a senior government official with the chief minster’s office, who did not want to be named, said.Chhattisgarh cabinet approved the scheme on May 14. “Our leadership has been advocating the direct transfer of money to the people. We have seen the amazing result of this cash transfer in Chhattisgarh last year. So, we decided to put money in farmers’ pocket again. I am confident that this scheme will help in revival of economy post-Covid-19,” chief minister Bhupesh Baghel said.Chhattisgarh based social workers said the scheme was the right of the farmers. “This is a welcome step as the farmers would be getting money directly in their bank accounts. If the government is claiming it as Nyay Yojana, why aren’t the all 30 lakh paddy farmers of the state are covered in this scheme? These 18.75 lakh paddy farmers, who are benefited under the scheme are those who had sold their crops at the central price,” Alok Shukla, a social activist based in Chhattisgarh, said. The Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP’s) Chhattisgarh unit questioned the scheme and said it will not do justice to the farmers.“This is ‘Anyay Yojna’ not Nyay Yojana. The money is given to the farmers in four instalments which will be of no use to them. They promised that they will be giving the difference amount in one instalment but they ditched the farmers of the state,” senior BJP leader and spokesperson Sacchinand Upasane said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-to-launch-rajiv-gandhi-nyay-yojana-for-farmers-on-may-21-former-pm-s-death-anniversary/story-0i6h2FlVgVGmDxCZRTD3MN.html

It’s an anti-national act which could be possible because of patronage of the ruling party BJP. I demand of Shivraj Singh Chouhan government to order lodging of an FIR against those who indulged in the act,” said RP Singh, Congress leader in Gwalior.“It’s unfortunate that the state government endorses the ideology of Nathuram Godse. That’s why celebration of Godse’s anniversary by lighting lamps by some people who don’t believe in democracy is not surprising,” another Congress leader KK Mishra said.But the state unit of the BJP hit back at Congress. “Congress is in habit of trying to draw political mileage from any such situation as it has lost its base in Madhya Pradesh and relevance in politics. The fact is BJP has nothing to do with any celebration on Godse’s birth anniversary,” said Madhya Pradesh BJP spokesperson Rajneesh Agrawal.Earlier in November 2017, Hindu Mahasabha set up a shrine of Godse in its Gwalior office on the death anniversary of Godse by installing his bust. Godse’s bust was unveiled amid vedic chants and it was worshipped with cow urine, curd, milk, honey and water of Ganges.The district administration in Gwalior later forcibly removed the bust when Congress lodged its protest against it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/war-of-words-between-congress-bjp-as-godse-s-anniversary-celebrated-in-madhya-pradesh/story-7JPipigY8eLu2ZuEzSFKZP.html

His wife, Dr Alpana Jha (49), tested positive a few days later, along with their daughter.He was also part of the first cluster of cases that were reported from Delhi. His colony in Dilshad Garden was one of the city’s first containment zones.“I was a little apprehensive on my first day back. I kept wondering whether patients would be scared to come to my clinic. Everybody in the area knew my wife and I had the infection. But the reception we received was quite the opposite. My regular patients actually came just to ask about my health and well-being. It was nice to talk to them again,” Dr Gopal Jha said. The clinic was sanitised and kept ready while he recovered from severe symptoms of the disease at Safdarjung hospital.He was discharged in the first week of April. He started developing symptoms the day after he got a call from the district authorities asking him to get tested at Guru Teg Bahadur hospital near his house, after one of the patients he had referred there tested positive. He was moved to Safdarjung hospital when he got high fever, cough, loose motion, and had to be put on oxygen therapy for breathing difficulties. His wife and daughter had mild symptoms.“At first I developed a mild fever, which I thought could be because of all the stress... Then, the fever shot up a day later and I started coughing two days after that. I had loose motion and high fever for all 14 fourteen days. The worst was the feeling that I could not breathe. The doctors had to put me on oxygen, after I told them I was feeling a little breathless,” he said.“I did not expect I would have the infection. I maintained social distance when the patient came in. She would have been in my clinic for no longer than five minutes, and I cleaned all the surfaces after she left,” said Dr Jha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ht-salutes-2-recovered-mohalla-clinic-docs-returned-to-a-caring-response/story-oocl1ZU9sNxahj7mBENjOI.html
20-05-2020||India||HT Salutes: The worry of coming home to a joint family||Dr Srishti Prakash worries constantly about returning home after work. She is a postgraduate student in the gynaecology department of Safdarjung hospital, one of the busiest departments across hospitals in Delhi. Around 50 of her colleagues have so far tested positive for Covid-19. She lives in a joint family with 12 others in a three-storey Ghaziabad house. The family includes her elderly grandmother, who has diabetes, and grandfather, who had prostate cancer. The elderly, and those with co-morbid conditions like diabetes, hypertension, kidney and heart disease are at an increased risk of developing severe Covid-19 symptoms.“When I am at work, it is like any other day. We have to maintain social distance, wear masks, gloves and gowns properly. My only fear is carrying the infection home with me,” Dr Prakash said. Her last round of Covid-19 duty in the super-speciality block — where Covid-positive women deliver — was in March, and her next is likely to come soon.“The hospital arranges accommodation for those on Covid-19 duty, so I do not have to go home till I am sure I do not have the infection. But when I work in the other wards, there is a persistent worry, because most Covid-19 patients generally are now asymptomatic,” she said. Every day, before leaving hospital, she cleans her cellphone, pens, and anything in her bag that might have been exposed, with cotton and sanitiser. When she gets home, she first takes a bath and washes the clothes she wore to work.“Everyone is staying home right now, and it scares me that I might be the one to bring the infection home. So, whenever I feel like I might have been exposed to someone with the infection, I stay back in the hostel along with some of my friends,” Dr Prakash said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ht-salutes-the-worry-of-coming-home-to-a-joint-family/story-t0Q2bPzy0XNayLWSrbVFmK.html
20-05-2020||India||HT Salutes: A Covid +ve doctor found support from an unlikely source||Dr Aditi Puniya found out she was Covid-positive at 2pm on April 24. By 4pm, people in her colony and all her friends knew about the diagnosis. The resident welfare association (RWA) of the colony in Ghaziabad where she lived had put up a notice everywhere letting people know she had tested positive, and an NGO had tweeted about it.“I was surprised. I was getting calls from everywhere about the diagnosis. I don’t think there was any malice behind what the RWA did, they probably just wanted to inform people and did not know what to do,” said Dr Puniya. She is a postgraduate student working in the department of paediatrics in Jag Parvesh Chandra hospital.Her sister tested negative and was put up in a quarantine centre in Ghaziabad, while Dr Puniya was admitted to a Covid-designated hospital.But it was not all bad. When her sister returned from quarantine, a neighbour started giving them food thrice a week. “We were not very close earlier; we would just greet each other when we met in the lift or lobby. But we have become very close now. My sister got back home before me. The neighbour called my sister to the balcony and gave her food. She still continues to share food with us,” Dr Puniya said.Many of her colleagues weren’t as lucky. She first started feeling ill, with a fever and shortness of breath — on April 19, and the head of her department asked her to go back home and get tested as a precaution. When she tested positive, the hospital started contact tracing.Several members of staff were asked to go into quarantine. “Some of them had very bad experiences, with people not coming close to their house. Our area was declared a containment zone after I tested positive, and groceries were delivered to our houses. But for many others in non-containment areas, getting groceries became difficult during home quarantine, and their neighbours did not help,” she said. Her colleagues stepped up and started bringing groceries to all those who had been quarantined.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ht-salutes-a-covid-ve-doctor-found-support-from-an-unlikely-source/story-N4uSCgk0cNfOa77mcWWBQP.html
20-05-2020||India||From June 1, govt to restart 200 trains but without ACs, bookings to start soon||Indian Railways will run 200 special passenger trains a day from June 1 and online ticket booking will begin soon, railway minister Piyush Goyal said on Tuesday, in a fresh step aimed at gradually resuming normalcy in the services of the national carrier. These trains will run with non-air conditioned coaches and are expected to cater to small towns, according to officials aware of the developments. The schedule will be announced soon, the railway ministry said.The 200 trains announced on Tuesday will run in addition to the premium passenger trains connecting New Delhi with 15 cities across India, and the ones ferrying stranded migrant labourers to their hometowns.“Apart from this, from June 1, railways will run 200 non-AC trains a day according to the time table…online bookings will begin soon,” Goyal tweeted. In a statement announcing the new trains, the railway ministry said: “No tickets will be sold at any railway station and prospective travellers should not come to the railway station to buy tickets.”According to officials who did not want to be named, these passenger trains will run long distance and are likely to connect smaller cities. They could also help expedite the transport of migrants stuck in different parts of the country due to the lockdown imposed to stop the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).On Twitter, Goyal also said the railways will increase the number of Shramik Special trains to 400 a day — from the current 150 — within the next two days. “All migrants are requested to stay where they are, Indian Railways will get them back home over the next few days,” he said.On May 1, the government began operating Shramik Special trains after demands by several states. And on May 12, Indian Railways resumed its passenger services after a gap of nearly two months with 15 pairs of trains connecting Delhi with Dibrugarh (Assam), Agartala (Tripura), Howrah (West Bengal), Patna (Bihar), Bilaspur (Chhattisgarh), Ranchi (Jharkhand), Bhubaneswar (Odisha), Secunderabad (Telangana), Bengaluru (Karnataka), Chennai (Tamil Nadu), Thiruvananthapuram (Kerala), Madgaon (Goa), Mumbai Central (Maharashtra), Ahmedabad (Gujarat) and Jammu Tawi (Jammu and Kashmir).Railways stopped its passenger services in an unprecedented move on March 22 in the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak. The 167-year-old rail network of India ran nearly 14,000 passenger trains and ferried 23 million passengers a day before the lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/from-june-1-govt-to-restart-200-trains-but-without-acs/story-yG6WCi5S9OYSD6Q7L9VqOK.html
20-05-2020||India||Bengal, Odisha brace for barrelling cyclone Amphan||Cyclone Amphan is poised to slam into West Bengal and Odisha on Wednesday afternoon, packing winds gusting to a speed of 185 kmph, bringing with it torrential rainfall, threatening to inundate low-lying areas of human habitation and cause extensive damage to crops and public property at a time when the nation has its hands full with the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Amphan is expected to make landfall between Digha in West Bengal and Hatiya Island in Bangladesh, close to the Sundarbans and around Sagar Island, as a very severe cyclonic storm, bordering on an extremely severe cyclonic storm.On Tuesday afternoon, the storm was packing wind speeds of 200 to 210 kmph, gusting to 240 kmph. Its intensity had reduced marginally, bordering a super cyclone and an extremely severe cyclonic storm. According to IMD’s glossary, an extremely severe cyclonic storm carries wind speed of between 167 kmph and 221 kmph; a storm is classified as a super cyclone when wind speeds exceed 222 kmph.National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) director general SN Pradhan said people from low-lying areas were being evacuated.“The biggest challenge is that we are facing two disasters together—Covid-19 and cyclone. We are also creating awareness about Covid-19 while creating awareness about Amphan and evacuating people,” Pradhan said.He cited one example what it means to confront two such challenges simultaneously. If a cyclone shelter has a capacity of 1,000, because of social distancing norms and the need to maintain adequate sanitation to curb the spread of Covid-19, only 400 to 500 people can be sheltered there, said Pradhan.Amphan had been billed as the first super cyclone in the Bay of Bengal since a 1999 storm devastated Odisha, killing around 9,000 people.“After the 1999 super cyclone, this is the most intense.... Though its wind speed will reduce to 155 to 165 kmph, gusting to 185 kmph, we can expect extensive damage and devastation in South and North 24 Parganas and East Medinipur,” IMD director general M Mohapatra said at a media briefing on Tuesday.The storm surge is expected to be 4 to 6 metres above the astronomical tide in parts of West Bengal, flooding low lying areas in the three districts when it makes landfall. Wind speeds in Kolkata, Hooghly and Howrah are likely to range between 110 kmph and 120 kmph, gusting to 130 kmph.Gale-force winds of 75 to 85 kmph, gusting to 95 kmph, are likely to lash the north Odisha coast, including Jagatsignghpur, Bhadrak, Balasore, Kendrapara and other areas.Meteorologists and climate scientists said that on Monday evening the intensity of Amphan was 145 knots, or 270 kmph. The wind speed passed the 1999 super cyclone velocity of 260 kmph, tweeted meteorologist Eric Holthous, based on data from the US-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center.Bay of Bengal recorded sea surface temperature of 32 to 34 degree Celsius prior to the formation of cyclone Amphan, Roxy Mathew Koll, climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, said. “We have never seen such high values until now. Tropical cyclones draw their energy from the ocean surface and these temperatures can supercharge a cyclone, leading to rapid intensification. Cyclone Amphan intensified from a category 1 to a category 5 cyclone in only 18 hours, it evolved into the strongest cyclone ever recoded in Bay of Bengal,” Koll wrote in a social media post on Twitter, sharing sea surface temperature data from the buoys of the National Institute of Ocean Technology.Sunita Devi, cyclone scientist at IMD, said the wind speed was 130 knots, or about 240 kmph. “Yes, ocean surface temperatures were high. The sea surface temperature was in the range of 30 to 31° Celsius on Monday, as compared to an expected temperature of 28° Celsius over the region,” Devi said. “On Tuesday, the maximum temperature is around 30° C. The cyclone is still bordering a super cyclone. Its intensity hasn’t reduced much. We are expecting it to make landfall as a very severe cyclonic storm, again bordering an extremely severe cyclonic storm,” Devi added.Amphan was a massive cyclone 700 km in extent and 15 km in height when it was rotating around its centre in the central parts of Bay of Bengal on Monday, Mohapatra had said, adding that its very rapid intensification was unusual.The cyclone is expected to cause heavy to extremely heavy rainfall over Gangetic West Bengal and heavy to very heavy rainfall over north coastal Odisha. It will also cause heavy to very heavy rainfall over sub-Himalayan West Bengal and Sikkim on May 20 and 21 and Assam and Meghalaya on May 21.IMD is expecting extensive damage to thatched houses, some damage to old, ramshackle concrete structures; uprooting of communication and power poles, disruption of rail/road links at several places, extensive damage to standing crops, plantations and orchards. Large boats may get torn from their moorings.NDRF has 15 teams in Odisha; 19 in West Bengal and two in reserve for rescue and relief efforts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-odisha-brace-for-barrelling-cyclone/story-OEARGd3IKyYyCX9PUNBb2M.html
20-05-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||Is Mumbai India’s New York? And is Maharashtra, India’s New York State?The questions are in the context of the coronavirus disease. New York State accounts for 356,278 (as of Tuesday morning) of the total of around 1.51 million cases in the country – around 23.5%. And 28,302 deaths – 31.3% of the 90,293 deaths in the country.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageNew York City accounted for 198,114 of these cases and 20,298 deaths – 13.1% and 22.4% of the cases and the deaths in the country, respectively.On Tuesday morning, Maharashtra accounted for 35,058 of India’s 100,311 cases and 1,249 of 3,081 deaths – 35% and 41% respectively.Of these, Mumbai’s share was 21,335 and 757 – 21.2% and 25% of the cases and deaths in the country respectively. That one in four deaths in India from Covid-19 has taken place in its commercial capital and one of its two most important cities is staggering.The comparative figures for Delhi were 10,054 and 160 – 10% and 5.2% of the India total, respectively.The number of cases in Mumbai and Delhi have accelerated in the past two weeks – but so have cases across India.In the two weeks between May 4 and May 18, the number of cases in Mumbai rose by 12,025 (56% of the total cases in Mumbai were recorded since May 4). In the same period, the number of cases in Delhi increased by 5,156 (or 51.28% of the total cases in Delhi were recorded since May 4). At the national level, India has recorded 54% of its cases in the past two weeks.To answer the original question, Mumbai’s trajectory of cases has followed a more even curve than New York City’s, which was steep. But Mumbai is also more densely populated than NY, and smaller (see page 5).As for why, there are no easy answers.Higher testing alone doesn’t explain this, although it may be one reason why both Delhi and Mumbai are showing as many cases as they are.Delhi tests around 7,354 people for every million of its population (according to data available till Monday night). Mumbai was testing 7,040 per million, according to data available till May 14. That number is likely to have increased.Density may be a factor, as could the presence of large slums. Mumbai has Asia’s largest, Dharavi, and it has seen 1,327 cases and 56 deaths thus far.For some time, it looked as if Mumbai was going the New York City way even in terms of the death rate – it was higher than 7% for some weeks in April. It is now 3.5% (number of deaths as a percentage of number of cases). The corresponding proportion for NYC is 10.2%.That’s a huge difference – but it is also in keeping with the trend that the fatality rate of Covid-19 infections in India has remained lower than that in other countries.It’s probably the reason why India shouldn’t worry too much about the spike in cases. Its focus should be on minimising deaths. Tamil Nadu is a good role model (so far). With 11,760 cases till Tuesday, it has seen only 81 deaths, a fatality rate of 0.69%. Almost 70% of the cases in the southern state have been added in the past two weeks.As India opens up even as it sees a spike in cases, comes the good news that Moderna’s mRNA vaccine seeing great results in a limited study of eight people.The vaccine will now have to go through a much larger human trial. Interestingly, if approved, it will become the world’s first mRNA vaccine. In contrast to normal vaccines that use inactive forms of the virus or bacteria causing the disease, mRNA vaccines use messenger RNA from the virus to instruct the body’s own cells to produce the viral protein. The body’s immune system registers and reacts to them, producing what is called an immune reaction. Moderna’s vaccine against Covid-19 did just this.There’s even better news – there’s work happening on similar vaccines in India||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-0Zb4HvqAPHqWsULAkF4JDK.html
20-05-2020||India||12-year-old left alone at night at Uttarakhand quarantine centre, probe ordered||A 12-year-old boy was left alone at night at a quarantine centre in Gangapur village of Nainital’s Haldwani area on Sunday after he returned from Rampur in Uttar Pradesh. The district administration has ordered a probe into the matter.The boy spent the night alone at a primary school while his father waited outside, who had brought dinner for him. After the father gave him dinner and left, the local guard of the school closed the gate. The boy’s father was taken aback as there was nobody in the school to look after his son and so he decided to wait outside to ensure that the boy doesn’t feel alone or frightened.Officials said that there was no one at the quarantine centre to look after the child at night and the gate was opened the next morning after the boy’s father was seen waiting outside.Lalit Sanwal, gram pradhan of Gangapur village, said that the gate had been locked for security purposes.“We had locked the gate for the safety and security of the boy quarantined at the primary school. There was an ASHA worker to look after the child,” said Sanwal.However, the boy’s father alleged that he found the boy alone at the centre. Nirmala Joshi, block development officer and nodal officer for the quarantine centre, said “this is a very serious matter. I have instructed the panchayat secretary to hold an inquiry into this. The minor boy could not have come alone from Rampur. People who accompanied him should also have been quarantined at the same centre,” said Joshi.According to guidelines stated by the government, a minor should be quarantined with his or her family members, who along with the gram pradhan are supposed to look after the minor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/12-year-old-left-alone-at-night-at-uttarakhand-quarantine-centre-probe-ordered/story-88FHXg5R7ux7LqUgdC6GqK.html
20-05-2020||India||2 migrants workers killed, over 20 injured in road accidents in Odisha||Two migrant workers died and over 20 were injured in four separate road accidents in Odisha on Tuesday. In Angul district, the driver of an LPG tanker was charred to death when a bus carrying 26 migrants on its way to West Bengal from Mumbai rammed headlong into the tanker at Luhamunda area. At least 12 migrants sustained injuries in the accident and were admitted to Angul district headquarters hospital.In a separate incident, a migrant worker of Balasore sitting atop a iron sheet-laden truck was killed when the vehicle hit another truck parked in front of a marine products export company in Bahanaga. The truck driver was seriously injured in the accident. Similarly, an Odia migrant worker was killed as the trolley he was travelling in was hit by a truck from behind near Uliapatna in Soro area of Balasore.In Cuttack district, at least 10 migrant workers were injured as the bus carrying them from Tamil Nadu rammed into a truck parked on the road near Tangi area of the district early this morning. All the injured have been admitted to SCB Medical College and Hospital. The bus was on its way to Bhadrak district.A truck driver was killed after a bus, returning to Bhubaneswar after deboarding migrant workers in Kolkata, collided with the truck near Panapana in Balasore district. The bus driver sustained injuries.Seventeen migrant workers of Odisha have so far died in different circumstances since the lockdown was announced on March 25 to prevent the coronavirus disease from spreading. Last week, Satyaban Swain, a 28-year-old migrant worker from Ganjam working in a private factory of Surat died after he was allegedly beaten up by police while a 56-year-old Dhubei Mohanty, a migrant worker in Kolkata died near Odisha-Bengal inter-state tollgate after tripping on road. An Odia migrant worker in Haryana last week hanged himself to death after failing to come back to his village in Kendrapara district due to lockdown. Gangadhar Biswal, a migrant worker from Kendrapara district was found hanging from a tree in Yamuna Vihar area of Haryana, a day after he posted a video appeal on social media to help him return to his village.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-migrants-workers-killed-over-20-injured-in-road-accidents-in-odisha/story-eb28JLgIorC4QI70rTg5FO.html
20-05-2020||India||Rs 20,500-crore loan support for farmers to sow crop||The Union government will issue Rs 20,500 crore worth of quick loans to farmers who need money for the critical summer-sowing season starting in June, a tranche that will be drawn from an already available fund, but which will ultimately be replenished by farm-sector credit announced by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman,an official from the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) said on condition of anonymity.Farmers access agricultural loans, critical for meeting inputs such as fertilisers, seeds and power, through three types of rural banks across states. These are 33 state co-operative banks, 352 district central co-operative Banks and 43 rural regional banks.During India’s summer-sown season, known as kharif, farmers plant the widest variety of crops, such as rice, pulses, groundnut, coarse cereals, sorghum and maize, among others. This accounts for half of India’s annual food output.Farm-sector credit announced by Sitharaman is yet to be notified by the Reserve Bank of India, but the quick loans will go from NABARD, India’s main state-run financier for rural needs.  NABARD will take usual route of reaching farmers. “NABARD will extend Rs 20,500 crore. Of this, Rs 15,200 crore will be extended through cooperative banks and balance Rs 5,300 crore through rural regional banks as a special liquidity facility in various states,” the NABARD official said .“It will augment the resources of cooperative banks and rural regional banks to enable them to extend credit to farmers for pre-monsoon and kharif (summer-sown season) 2020 operations,”this person added.The fund will be made available as a means of “frontloading” of resources of these banks so as to ensure adequate liquidity with them for financing farmers, the official said. Front-loading is a financial term that means upfront injection of liquidity. The government subsidises short-term crop loans to make farming cheaper. Moreover, banks must necessarily lend to farmers because agriculture is a so-called priority lending sector. All scheduled commercial banks must direct 40% of their adjusted net bank credit towards priority sector lending.Farmers get crop loans at a cheaper 7% as compared to consumer loans, on which the interest ranges from 12% and 14%. For those making timely repayments, the effective rate of interest is even lower at 4%.“Farmers have already accessed over Rs 4 lakh crore of such credit this year. Agriculture is the only sector appears better equipped to absorb the lockdown shocks because supply lines of fertilisers and seeds etc have fared better than other goods,” said Abhishek Agrawal, an economist with Comtrade, a commodities firm. The prediction of a normal 2020 June-to-September monsoon by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has brought relief to farmers, as it will likely lessen the strain on the economy from widespread disruptions caused by the Covid-19. The monsoon rains are critical because nearly 60% of India’s net arable land lacks irrigation and half the population depends on agriculture for a livelihood.With good rains, spending by rural consumers on manufactured items such as television sets and gold jewellery goes up, and boosts factory output. A deficient monsoon cuts rural consumption and also drives up inflation. A normal monsoon is key for robust agricultural output growth, which the government targets at around 4%.Agrawal said since incomes of every class had been hurt, a “class of farmers may still be in need of cash”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/20-500-cr-loan-support-for-farmers-to-sow-crop/story-blxmKFbLWX0j3JHjzzUCGJ.html
20-05-2020||India||Sonia Gandhi to chair Oppn leaders’ meeting||Congress president Sonia Gandhi will on Friday chair an opposition leaders’ meeting via video-conferencing to discuss the impact of the Covid-19 lockdown, the Centre’s Rs 20 lakh crore package, the plight of migrants, farmers and the suspension of labour laws in Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled states.A Congress leader said Gandhi and her party’s key ally, Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar, were keen on holding the meeting and chalk out a future course of action. He said the two spoke twice to finalise the meeting.People aware of the matter said the opposition parties want to put pressure on the government to accept their demands for announcing “adequate relief measures”, including direct cash transfers for the poor, migrant workers, farmers as well as a financial package for micro, small and medium enterprises as part of a revised package to revive the crisis-hit economy.“The opposition parties want to discuss the Covid-19 situation. That is good. We discuss with the government regularly. Now, the opposition parties will discuss how we can do better and what we are facing,” said West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee.Banerjee’s Maharashtra and Jharkhand counterparts, Uddhav Thackeray and Hemant Soren, Pawar, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam chief MK Stalin, Communist Party of India (Marxist) general secretary Sitaram Yechury, Communist Party of India general secretary D Raja will attend the meeting. Rashtriya Janata Dal, Indian Union Muslim League, Jammu & Kashmir National Conference, All India United Democratic Front, Loktantrik Janata Dal and Revolutionary Socialist Party leaders, too, are expected to join it. The Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party were yet to confirm their participation, the people added.This will be the first meeting of the opposition leaders since the lockdown was enforced across the country on March 25 to contain the Covid-19 pandemic. The Congress and the BJP have been involved in a war of words on issues like the plight of migrant workers left jobless by the lockdown. The workers have continued to cycle and walk back to their homes even as buses in late April and special trains have been arranged for them since May 1. The Congress has accused the government of being insensitive towards the plight of the workers. The BJP has hit back and blamed the opposition party for politicising the issue. Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi interacted with and arranged transportation for a group of workers from Delhi on Saturday.The two parties have also exchanged words over the suspension of major labour laws in BJP-ruled Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh to help businesses recoup from the Covid-19 blow and to create more jobs.Rahul Gandhi has accused the government of using Covid-19 as an excuse to exploit the workers, suppress their voice and crush their human rights.The Congress has called the Centre’s Covid-19 economic package “hopelessly inadequate” and said it has “left high and dry” several sections, including 130 million families at the bottom half of the population, migrant workers and farmers. It has maintained the package only amounts to Rs 1,86,650 crore, which is barely 0.91% of the GDP, and includes already budgeted expenditure, regulatory measures, and proposed reforms.Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the package last week to help individuals and businesses. Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman has announced details of the package, which the Centre has said is equivalent of a little below 10% of the GDP. BJP refused comment on the meeting.Hyderabad-based political analyst C Narasimha Rao said the entire country is pained at seeing the plight of migrant workers, maintaining that it is the responsibility of both the ruling side and the opposition parties to ensure these stranded labourers return safely to their home states. “The opposition parties should join hands and put pressure on the government to ensure the suffering of the migrant workers is ameliorated,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sonia-to-chair-oppn-leaders-meeting/story-3BYCeG84wmK30FiJa6gxFL.html
20-05-2020||India||Covid-19 crisis: 100,000 samples tested for second straight day||Over 100,000 samples were tested for Covid-19 in India on a second consecutive day (101,475) on Tuesday and took the total number of tests to more than 2.4 million in about four months, officials aware of the matter said. On Monday, a record 108,233 samples were tested, more than the target of 100,000 samples daily that the Union health ministry has set. “The testing capacity has been strengthened significantly in the past couple of months, and we already hit a record in a single day by testing more than a lakh [100,000] samples. The cumulative samples that have been tested so far are also inching closer to 25 lakh [2.5 million], which is huge. Our testing capacity is adequate,” said an official on condition of anonymity.The World Health Organisation (WHO) has called on all countries to ramp up their testing as the best way to slow the advance of the pandemic. “We have a simple message to all countries - test, test, test,” WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in March.The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), the country’s apex biomedical research agency, has approved 385 government and 158 private laboratories for testing.In a statement on Tuesday, Union health ministry said through 14 All India Institute of Medical Sciences-like mentor institutions, handholding of labs across the country has been undertaken to ensure adequate bio-safety standards and accreditation of the laboratories. “To maintain a steady supply of testing material to the labs, 15 depots have been created by roping in India Posts and private agencies for distribution. Many Indian companies have been supported to undertake the production of testing material which was earlier primarily sourced from abroad. This has helped in maintaining steady supplies across the country,” it said. ICMR has been periodically revising guidelines for Covid-19 testing. On Monday, a directive widened the testing strategy to include frontline workers involved in containment and mitigation of Covid-19, all hospitalised patients, who develop influenza-like illness (lLl) symptoms, and all symptomatic ILI among returnees from abroad and migrants within seven days of onset of symptoms. “The more you test, the more you know about the disease pattern. It never harms to test more; it should not be less,” said Dr T Jacob John, a senior virologist.The country has also reported 0.2 deaths per 100,000 population as opposed to 4.1 globally, said the ministry’s statement, attributing the relatively low fatalities to timely case identification and clinical management.The number of cases per 100,000 population in the country stands at about 7.1 while it is nearly 60 globally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/100k-samples-tested-for-second-straight-day/story-N0Yc0K55nsfKOdS90kY8kK.html
20-05-2020||India||Double whammy of pandemic, climate disasters likely this year||Climate disasters this year, including Cyclone Amphan expected to hit India’s eastern coast on Wednesday, are likely to compound the problems related to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic since 2020 is also likely to be the warmest on record, a paper published on May 15 in British Nature journal has warned. There is a 74.67% chance of 2020 being the warmest year ever and a 99.94% chance that it will among the top five warmest years, the American National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said in March.The paper by Massachusetts Institute of Technology scientists and students has listed heat waves in north India, floods in the delta regions of West Bengal and Bangladesh, wildfires in Siberia, bushfires in Australia, locust crises, drought, water scarcity and floods in Africa, a hurricane in the US among others as climate-attributable risks. The risks are likely to intersect with the Covid-19 crisis over the next 12 to 18 months.“A concerning body of evidence already indicates that climate hazards, which are increasing in frequency and intensity under climate change, are likely to intersect with the Covid-19 outbreak and public health response. These compound risks will exacerbate and be exacerbated by the unfolding economic crisis and long-standing socioeconomic and racial disparities, both within countries and across regions,” said the paper.Fiji was hit by a category 5 tropical cyclone Harold in April. The Gulf Coast of the US is bracing for hurricane season while Louisiana has become the Covid-19 mortality hotspot. In South Africa, authorities are struggling to maintain social distancing during flooding in informal settlements. Drought in Zimbabwe has left millions without access to clean water, the paper said.The paper warned extreme heat events in the US and outside are likely to lead to excess mortality and morbidity, disrupt power supplies, hospitals and emergency services, especially in cities.Emergency response agencies and first responders will have to be deployed across multiple crises at the same time. For example, American Federal Emergency Management Agency is coordinating Covid-19 as well as ongoing extreme weather responses. India’s National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) is faced with similar dual responsibilities including rescue and evacuation efforts related to Amphan. “Cyclone Amphan is very intense and has the potential to do large-scale damage. It is a big challenge as the cyclone is striking during the outbreak of Covid-19. We [NDRF] are facing two disasters. It a cyclone in the time of Covid-19,” NDRF chief SN Pradhan said.The paper has recommended coordination at every level of government to prevent potential conflicts of strategy across agencies as difficult policy decisions may lie ahead, including whether hospitals, especially intensive care units, can be evacuated safely. It has also recommended policies on managing health risks during large scale evacuation or sheltering. Detailed plans need to be drafted for compound risk preparedness and governments need to ensure continuous electricity and water supply to avoid an increase in transmission of Covid 19, it said.The paper said overall a long-term strategy for pandemic preparedness is also needed. “...Covid-19 is neither the first nor only time that our globalized society will face these types of compound risks; for example, Puerto Rico was forced to stop Zika surveillance and response in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria [2017].”Roxy Mathew Koll, a climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, said while they were preparing the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports, they realised that the worst-case scenarios are the compound climate events, where multiple extreme events overlap. “For example, floods due to extreme rains and the high tide coming together when the sea level is also high. Or where the warming in the tropical oceans are making it much more fertile in terms of cyclonic activities and intense storm surges [cyclone Amphan is the best example],” said Koll. Koll added even developed nations are not well equipped to mitigate such kind of compound events. “Most of the low-to-middle income nations in the tropics do not have early warning systems in place or long-term policies to adapt and mitigate climate change. Now, on top of that, the Covid-19 pandemic is presenting new hurdles.” Koll said the paper points out that the growing threats of climate crisis cannot be disregarded. “We need a framework to address both the disasters hand-in-hand.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/double-whammy-of-pandemic-climate-disasters-likely-this-yr/story-HDLrnTzrq43BHDLXXsusEL.html
20-05-2020||India||Govt tackles twin challenge of cyclone Amphan, Covid outbreak||The Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), preoccupied with the enormous challenge of tackling the coronavirus disease and containing its spread, now also has to worry about super cyclone Amphan, which is set to make landfall in West Bengal on Wednesday.According to functionaries familiar with the situation, the PMO’s focus for the past two months has been almost exclusively on Covid-19, whether giving final touches to federal guidelines on how to deal with the public health crisis, coming up with new strategies to contain its spread, ensuring relief for stranded migrant workers or preparing plans for a revival of the economy.With Amphan set to make landfall in West Bengal between Digha and Hatiya Island in Bangladesh on Wednesday afternoon, the PMO as well as the home ministry are in talks with key ministries and states administrations to size up their preparedness to tackle what has been billed as the first super cyclone in the Bay of Bengal since 1999, when over 9,000 people were killed in Odisha.The PMO is engaged in efforts to ensure that plans are in place for the relief and rehabilitation of people at risk of facing the brunt of the storm, officials said. It is also keeping an eye on the supply of food, medicines and other essential items and coordinating between ministries on the logistics of the exercise.“Most of the meetings in the PMO are related to Covid. But from Sunday onwards, there has been one daily meeting on the cyclone,” said an official, requesting anonymity.One of the major concerns that figured during the meetings at the PMO is how the cyclone may impact the battle against Covid in the affected areas.Management of Covid-19 requires strict adherence to guidelines such as social distancing, quarantines and the need to avoid crowded spaces . The concern is that the cyclone, with the potential to throw life out of gear in large areas that lie in its path, may upset their implementation. “When the PMO takes these meetings, the plans are made also keeping in mind that the cyclone will come amidst an extraordinary health situation,” one official saidOn Tuesday, cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba chaired the third meeting of the National Crisis Management Committee (NCMC) to review the preparedness of states, central ministries and other agencies to tackle the cyclone and its aftermath.The India Meteorological Department said the super cyclone was expected to hit the West Bengal coast with wind speeds ranging up to 155-165 kmph, gusting to 185 kmph, accompanied by heavy rainfall. Several districts including Kolkata may be affected, it has warned.“Chief Secretary, Odisha and Additional Chief Secretary, West Bengal apprised the NCMC of preparatory measures taken by them. They informed that evacuation of people from the low-lying areas is being carried out. All actions have been taken to stock food grains, drinking water and other essential supplies. Teams for maintenance and restoration of Power and Telecom services have also been positioned,” said a government communique.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-tackles-twin-challenge-of-cyclone-covid-outbreak/story-jDWIjw5jRFN0YLVBQsqXtN.html
20-05-2020||India||As cyclone Amphan nears, 4.2 million evacuated in coastal regions of India, Bangladesh||Nearly 4.2 million people have been moved to safety in the coastal regions of India and Bangladesh anticipating one of the severest cyclones in decades, Amphan, making landfall somewhere on the border of the two countries on Wednesday, officials said.On Tuesday, Amphon was still several hundred kilometres out to sea in the Bay of Bengal, packing winds of up to 235 kmph and gusts of 255 kmph. It is, however, expected to lose some steam before the landfall between Digha in West Bengal and Hatiya Islands in Bangladesh.According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), cyclone Amphan is expected to cause more damage than its predecessors, cyclone Bulbul in November 2019 and cyclone Alia, 11 years ago. During Bulbul, a total of 1.8 lakh people had been evacuated and about a million people were affected. “We have shared the data with Bangladesh also as part of regional office of World Meteorological Organisation,” said Sanjib Banerjee, deputy director general of regional meteorological centre in Kolkata.The cyclone will hit when India and Bangladesh are in various stages lockdown to contain the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic and the cyclone relief centres in both the countries are being used as quarantines for a large number of migrant workers returning home. Officials said around 2 million have been evacuated in the coastal districts of West Bengal (1.8 million) and Odisha (2 lakh) and about 2.2 million in Bangladesh. In both Bengal and Odisha, the government has turned vacant school, colleges and other government office buildings into relief centres to ensure social distancing norms. At least three West Bengal coastal districts - East Midnapore, North 24 Parganas and South 24 Parganas – and four of Odisha -- Balasore, Bhadrak, Jagatsinghpur and Kendrapara --- are likely to bear the brunt of the cyclone.“We have around 60 cyclone shelters. But to maintain social distance we will use nearly 600 schools and colleges, where evacuated people will be shifted,” Partha Ghosh, district magistrate of East Midnapore.In the six coastal blocks of South 24 Parganas, at least 4200 migrants, who returned from other states over the past few days, have been kept in quarantine, some in cyclone shelters. Now, these shelters cannot be used for evacuees and the administration has turned panchayat offices into cyclone shelter homes.“The silver lining is that Covid-19 has not spread in the remote villages of coastal blocks,” said Javed Khan, disaster management minister of Bengal.Even though South 24 Parganas has registered 97 Covid-19 cases till date, none have been reported from its six coastal blocks, where the evacuation is in progress. In East Midnapore, only one of 52 cases has been reported from its six coastal blocks.“Nodal officers have been deputed for each shelter and front line workers, such as police, doctors and civil defence personnel are being given PPEs”, P Ulaganathan, district magistrate of South 24 Parganas, said.In Odisha’s Balasore, where there are 121 Covid-19 cases, officials said only those quarantine centres, which have not been occupied, will be used for cyclone relief. In the state’s Bhadrak district, another low-lying Covid-19 hot spot, district collector Gyana Ranjan Das said arrangements had been made to shift the evacuees to cyclone shelters inside 72 panchayats and 363 schools in the district. “558 schools have also been identified to accommodate more people if required,” he said.In addition to usual items like food, drinking water and medicines, this is the first time that masks and sanitisers, too, are being stocked at the shelters. People were being told about maintaining social distancing norms. “Nodal officers have been deputed for each shelter and front line workers such as police, doctors and civil defence personnel are being be given PPEs”, P Ulaganathan, district magistrate of South 24 Parganas, said.While asking people to maintain social distancing, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee said maintaining social distancing “may not be possible everywhere, as the priority was to save lives in the cyclone”.Odisha’s special relief commissioner (SRC) Pradeep Jena admitted that running cyclone relief centres during the pandemic was a challenge and said the situation was “under control” and that the district collectors had been “given a free hand”.Bangaldesh junior disaster management minister, Enamur Rahman, said the number of shelters had been doubled to ensure social distancing, and everyone would be made to wear masks.Banerjee said that nobody should “step outside their homes from Wednesday morning till Thursday noon,” and should wait for government clearance. “Railways and union home ministry have been requested to suspend movement of trains bringing in migrants from other states during the same period,” she said.District administrations in the two states are making public announcements in the coastal areas and have told fishermen not to venture out to sea, while small fishing boats that had ventured out earlier were contacted on distress alert transmitters and asked to returned to shore. NDRF and SDRF have been deployed in Bengal and Odisha’s coastal areas and sandbags are in place to strengthen embankments. Amphan’s impact on Odisha and West Bengal will likely be felt from Tuesday night onwards as wind speeds in the coastal areas are expected to pick up. Kolkata can see wind speed as high as 130 km per hour, an IMD statement said. Jena said gales between 95-110 kmph are likely to pummel the districts of Jagatsinghpur, Kendrapara, Bhadrak, Balasore and Mayurbhanj from Wednesday morning onwards even though the impact in Cuttack and Bhuvaneshwar will not be as severe. The entire region, including parts of north-east, will witness heavy to very heavy rainfall because of the cyclone till Friday.(With AFP inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-cyclone-amphan-nears-4-2mn-evacuated-in-coastal-regions-of-india-b-desh/story-bpZ14tH5LNaaDNckvZknDK.html
20-05-2020||India||Virus ideally suited to infect humans: Study||The novel coronavirus is ideally suited to infecting human cells rather than animal ones, a new study by researchers in Australia claims, raising questions about the origin of the virus, which has, until Tuesday, killed over 318,000 people and sickened more than 4.8 million globally.Using an “in silico” or computer simulation method, the researchers found that the data generated indicated “…SARSCoV2 [the virus that causes Covid-19] is uniquely adapted to infect humans, raising questions as to whether it arose in nature by a rare chance event or whether its origins lie elsewhere”.The four researchers, including two trained in India, tested the binding affinity of Covid-19 virus’s “spike protein” to humans and several animals including pangolins.“Notably, SARSCoV2 spike protein had the highest overall binding energy for human ACE2 (a receptor on cells), greater than all the other tested species including bat, the postulated source of the virus. This indicates that SARSCoV2 is a highly adapted human pathogen,” the study found.The study is yet to be peer-reviewed and now available on the prestigious US-based Cornell University’s pre-print server.The research is plausible but the evidence put out to support it was thin,Richard H Ebright, from the department of chemistry and chemical biology at the US’s Rutgers University, told HT.China has consistently denied, and cited international research, to deny that he virus originated in a high-security biology lab in Wuhan Institute of Virology, located in the central Chinese city where the Covid-19 disease broke out late last year.The four researchers of the paper, however, were surprised at the rapid rate at which the virus adapted to humans. “Normally a virus will bind tightly to the cells of its normal host species and less tightly to cells of species it has not infected before. The surprise with COVID is we found that it bound tightest to human cells than any other species we tested. This is either a massive coincidence or Covid-19 has somehow in the past been adapted for human cells. One way in which this can happen is via culture with human cells in a lab,” lead researcher Nikolai Petrovsky a clinician and vaccinologist, told HT over email.The other researchers involved are Sakshi Piplani and Puneet Singh, who are both bioinformatics scientist originally trained in India, and David Winkler, a professor of biochemistry and genetics.Piplani and Petrovsky are affiliated to the Flinders University in Australia, Singh is with Vaxine Pty and Winkler is affiliated to the La Trobe University.“Yes, this virus looks and behaves as if it is perfectly adapted to humans. That is a surprise for a virus that has apparently just entered humans for the first time,” Petrovsky said.He added that zoonotic events, where pathogens jump from animal to human, are not rare and have been regularly witnessed with Ebola, bird flu, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) etc.“What is rare is to not find any animal source of the virus. For example, for MERS it was rapidly identified to be coming from camels, SARS from bats via civet cats, Ebola from bats via monkeys. So far no animal source has been found for Covid-19 – this may still be found, but its absence allows other possibilities to be considered.”Not everyone, like Ebright,is fully convinced.“The conclusion of the paper that the virus was ‘pre-adapted for human transmission’ is consistent with the scenario of lab ‘gain-of-function’ research followed by a lab accident,” Ebright told HT over email.“Gain-of-function” is a scientific research term, which means accelerating research that improves the ability of a pathogen to cause disease.However, the evidence for the conclusion of the paper that the virus was ‘pre-adapted for human transmission’ is thin,” he said.Petrovsky said their study shows the need to carry out more research into the origins of the coronavirus.“Of course, we know there were institutes in Wuhan that were doing research on bat and pangolin coronaviruses to which Covid-19 is most closely related, with genetic elements from both. It is certainly possible that if both viruses ended up in a cell culture together, which is not unheard of in a lab due to cross contamination, then a new variant virus could be created just as it does in an animal that is infected by two viruses at the same time,” he said.“Both scenarios are equally possible, hence the need to do further investigation to see if either of these is the most likely explanation.”The need for further investigation is also emphasised in the research paper.“Given the seriousness of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, it is imperative that all efforts be made to identify the original source of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.”The researchers added: “In particular, it will be important to establish whether Covid-19 is due to a completely natural chance occurrence where a presumed bat virus was transmitted to humans via an intermediate animal host or whether COVID-19 has alternative origins. This information will be of paramount importance to help prevent any similar human coronavirus outbreak in the future.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/virus-ideally-suited-to-infect-humans-study/story-LBF93IypYG0YjS9c7N21vK.html
20-05-2020||India||Drug being tested could help in Covid-19 recovery, say Chinese scientists||A research team at a Beijing university has claimed to have successfully tested an experimental drug on animals that could shorten the recovery time for Covid-19 patients and offer short-term immunity to the pathogen, which has infected 4.8 million people globally and killed over 315,000 since originating in China late last year.A Peking University statement said on Monday that the team led by Sunney Xie, the director of its Beijing Advanced Innovation Centre for Genomics, has “successfully identified multiple highly potent neutralising antibodies against the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus of the respiratory disease COVID-19, from convalescent plasma [a blood fluid] by high-throughput single-cell sequencing”.According to a study on the team’s research published on Sunday in the online medical journal Cell, the “potent neutralising antibody could be used to develop drugs for both therapeutic intervention and prophylactic [preventive] protection against SARS-CoV-2”.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“If the Covid-19 epidemic reappears in the winter, our neutralising antibody might be available by that time,” Xie said in the statement.“When we injected antibodies into infected mice, after five days the viral load was reduced by a factor of 2,500,” Xie told the news agency AFP. “That means this potential drug has [a] therapeutic effect.”The drug uses neutralising antibodies -- produced by the human immune system to prevent the virus infecting cells -- which Xie’s team isolated from the blood of 60 recovered patients.Antibodies have been successfully used in treating other viruses like HIV, Ebola and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. Clinical trials in the US have showed Ebola drug Remdesivir shortened the recovery time in some Covid-19 patients by a third.Over 100 vaccines for Covid-19 are in the works globally even as the World Health Organisation has cautioned developing one could take up to 18 months.Three Covid-19 vaccines have entered phase II of clinical trials in Beijing, a municipal health official has said.Separately, five innovative drugs have also been approved for clinical trials and all of them have entered phase II clinical studies, said Xu Qiang, the head of the Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission.Beijing, Xu was quoted as saying by Xinhua news agency, will accelerate the research and development of diagnostic reagents, drugs, vaccines and medical equipment and support pharmaceutical and vaccine manufacturers in expanding their capacity to meet the increasing demands.The second phase of the clinical trials is expected to be completed successively beginning in JulyA total of 2,036 volunteer participants have been inoculated for the second phase of clinical trials and researchers are assessing whether or not the vaccines are safe and effective, Xinhua reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/drug-being-testedcould-help-in-covid-recovery-say-chinese-scientists/story-pWkFOf615yBnX8XfZSXx0J.html
20-05-2020||India||Temperature, humidity may do little to halt the spread of Covid||Higher temperature and humidity may do little to arrest the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, a new study has found, adding to a growing body of literature that indicate that the correlation between local climate conditions and virus transmission is weak. The study -- conducted by scientists at Princeton University and the US National Institutes of Health and published in the journal Science on Monday -- also suggested that the lack of sizeable immunity to the Sars-Cov-2 virus and the speed of the pathogen ensured that climate and humidity had a very limited impact on transmission. “It doesn’t seem that climate is regulating spread right now,” said Rachel Baker, a postdoctoral scholar in the Princeton Environmental Institute and first author of the paper. “We project that warmer or more humid climates will not slow the virus at the early stage of the pandemic.”A batch of studies during the initial surge of the pandemic had held out hope that drier and colder climates are more suited to the virus, and that the weather in tropical countries may hobble the spread to the disease. But this paper joins previous research from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the US National Academies of Sciences (NAS) that say while there is some evidence that Sars-CoV-2 transmits less efficiently in higher ambient temperature and humidity, this does not lead to a significant decrease in disease spread without major interventions, such as personal protection and social distancing.The scientists ran three scenarios. The first assumed that coronavirus has the same climate sensitivity as influenza. The second and third scenarios assumed the virus had the same climate dependence as OC43 and HKU1, which cause common cold and are of the same betacoronavirus genus as Sars-CoV-2.In all three scenarios, climate became a significant factor when large portions of the population were immune or resistant to the virus. “The more that immunity builds up in the population, the more we expect the sensitivity to climate to increase,” Baker said. In one of the simulations, the team found that despite very different climates in New York, London and Delhi, there was no substantial difference in pandemic size in various scenarios. While for HKU1 (which results in upper respiratory tract disease like common cold), tropical locations experienced a more sustained, lower intensity pandemic than the northern hemisphere, the dependence on climate was not as much for OC43 (known to cause common cold) was not as much.Without a vaccine or other control measures, Covid-19 will become responsive to seasonal changes only after the supply of unexposed hosts is reduced, said co-author Bryan Grenfell, professor at the Princeton Environmental Institute.“Our simulated control measures imply that the key determinant of reduced peak incidence is the extent to which population immunity builds over the control period...the timing of introduction and the efficacy of local control measures as well as factors such as population density and contact patterns could also shape future outcomes,” the study said. Yusuf Jameel, a postdoctoral researcher with MIT, said that monsoon may slow the spread of the disease only a little and that the correlation between temperature and the spread of coronavirus is weakening with time and growing cases in warmer countries. The scientists emphasised the need for more research in diverse locations and said the results didn’t account for potential cross-immunity from other coronavirus infections or the impact of rainfall. Coronaviruses that cause potentially serious human illness, including both Sars-CoV and Mers-CoV that caused outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome and middle-east respiratory syndrome in the past, have not demonstrated seasonality.“The researchers have run extensive models. Overall it suggests that in the initial stages of pandemic, people’s immune response is the most important in determining how the virus will impact the population. This is also called residual immunity. Even if people have immunity to other related viruses, it can help. Climate and other related factors will only gain prominence when the population has developed resistance or immunity to the disease,” said Amit Singh, associate professor, Centre for Infectious Disease Research, Indian Institute of Science.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/temperature-humidity-may-do-little-to-halt-the-spread-of-covid/story-Az7taYWq5wZ0pQCExMoPjL.html
20-05-2020||India||ICMR releases guidelines for testing suspected Covid deaths||The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has directed all hospitals to take nasal swab samples from dead bodies of suspected coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases, to test for the virus, in a detailed autopsy guideline for patients. “Collect Nasopharyngeal swab at the emergency department/casualty/ward/ICU and should be sent for Covid-19 RT-PCR test in all Suspected cases before moving the body to mortuary for preservation if the same was not sent in due hospital course,” state the guidelines that were released on Tuesday.The research body stated that bodies must not be released from the mortuaries, in case Covid-19 test results are awaited.As the disease is highly contagious, and the staff conducting the autopsy run the risk of contracting the infection, ICMR, in its guidelines, has also directed to treat death in hospital or under medical care due to Covid-19 as a NonMedicolegal case that doesn’t require a medico-legal autopsy and the required certification of death can be done by treating doctors.“The doctors, mortuary technicians and other mortuary staffs in mortuary performing autopsy are exposed to potentially high and dangerous health risks due to coming in direct contact with infected organs, fluids and secretions, even after taking the highest precautions. Hence, non-invasive autopsy technique should be adopted for forensic autopsy,” the directive stated.Since asymptomatic cases and patients in incubation period may not meet the diagnostic criteria for suspected cases, doctors should go by the possible epidemiological history.“…all dead bodies without reliable clinical/ epidemiological history and all unidentified dead bodies should be treated as suspected Covid-19 deaths. Cases with negative swab results also should be treated as suspected Covid-19 deaths as false negative result is not uncommon,” the guidelines stated.There should either be a separate mortuary or a place earmarked for preservation of bodies of unconfirmed Covid-19 cases, as per the guidelines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/icmr-releases-guidelines-for-testing-suspected-covid-deaths/story-J8rzIkJ0dxVC10bFMxzjdN.html
20-05-2020||India||Rs 6.45 lakh crore loaned to small borrowers||Public sector banks have sanctioned loans worth Rs 6.45 lakh crore in about two-and-a-half months to small borrowers, out of which about Rs 50,000 crore was approved in just one week ending May 15, as the government attempted to alleviate the distress caused to businesses by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic and subsequent lockdown. The loans were sanctioned to 5.5 million micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and retail, agriculture and corporate sectors between March 1 and May 15, the finance minister’s office (FMO) tweeted on Tuesday, describing it as a “notable increase compared to the Rs 5.95 lakh crore sanctioned as of May 8.”The loans included Rs 1.03 lakh crore extended as emergency credit lines and working capital enhancements, an increase from Rs 65,879 crore that had been sanctioned between March 1 and May 8, the ministry tweeted from its handle @nsitharamanoffc.Experts cautioned that a more accurate measure of the revival of industrial activity would be the actual disbursal of loans. The finance ministry could not immediately disclose disbursal data. A finance ministry spokesperson declined comment on loan disbursal. “Industrial activity is directly proportional to the credit off take. Companies will not draw money from the sanctioned limit unless they are confident about their returns on investment. When they don’t draw from their sanctioned limits, it automatically indicates inadequate activity,” said an executive member of a small industries association, who requested anonymity. Easy credit and collateral-free loans to the farm sector and MSMEs were components of the Rs 20.97 lakh crore Atamnirbhar Bharat Abhiyan (Self-Reliant India Initiative) announced by the Narendra Modi government to revive the economy in the wake of the economic crisis that followed the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown.While announcing the first tranche of the five-part package, finance minister Sitharaman on March 13 unveiled a Rs 3 lakh crore emergency working capital facility for small businesses, Rs 20,000 crore subordinate debt for stressed MSMEs and proposed to set up a “fund of funds” with a corpus of Rs 10,000 crore to provide equity funding support for MSMEs.On May 7, the FMO had said in a series of tweets that India’s economy was “poised to recover” as state-run banks had sanctioned loans worth Rs 5.66 lakh crore over last two months to about 4.2 million account holders belonging to MSMEs, retail, agriculture and corporate sectors, HT reported on May 8.“The industry does need money, particularly MSMEs. It is good that the money has been sanctioned, now disbursal should happen as soon as possible,” Niranjan Hiranandani, president of the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (Assocham), had said then. It is of paramount importance that these loan approvals get converted into disbursals as soon as possible, said Sanjay Aggarwal, senior vice president of the PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/6-45-l-cr-loaned-to-small-borrowers/story-B2SxxKXfG0DOOICeL49YyH.html
20-05-2020||India||Faster vaccines likely if Moderna effort succeeds||Moderna’s experimental vaccine against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has emerged the front-runner in the global effort to stop the pandemic after an early trial showed it produced virus-neutralising antibodies similar to those found in recovered patients.It is one of at least 20 experimental nucleic acid vaccines against Covoid-19 in various stages of clinical development that use the messenger RNA (mRNA) platform to elicit an immune response against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, according to the World Health Organization (WHO)’s draft landscape of Covid-19 candidate vaccines. Most of these vaccines encode the spike protein of Sars-CoV2. “If it is approved, it will be the first messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine against any disease in the world. We don’t fully know the effectiveness of mRNA vaccines as yet. However, there is high quality science and pre-clinical evidence for this fast and flexible platform for vaccine development. We will have to wait and see,” said Dr Anurag Agrawal, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research-Institute of Genomics & Integrative Biology, New Delhi.The new vaccine, called mRNA-1273, encodes for a pre-fusion stabilised form of the spike (S) protein selected by Moderna in collaboration with the US Vaccine Research Center at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. mRNA vaccines are promising alternatives to conventional vaccine approaches because of their high potency, capacity for rapid development and potential for low-cost manufacture and safe administration.“This is great news as RNA- and DNA-based vaccines are faster and cheaper to produce than synthetic vaccines as it involves synthetic production of the genetic material, and not the virus. The production is lab-based, so it can be quickly standardised and scaled up,” said Dr N K Ganguly, former director general, Indian Council of Medical Research.Vaccines work by training the body to recognise and respond to the proteins produced by disease-causing organisms, such as a virus or bacteria. Traditional vaccines use small or inactivated doses of the pathogen (virus or bacterium), or the proteins it produces, to provoke an immune response after vaccination without causing disease.mRNA vaccines use a synthetic version of the genetic blueprint the virus uses to build its infectious proteins. The synthetic nucleic acid is inserted into human cells, the humans cells read it as instructions to build fragments of the viral protein, which the immune system attacks by building antibodies against them.“Technological advances have made in vivo delivery of mRNA efficient, and several mRNA vaccine platforms against infectious diseases and some cancers have demonstrated encouraging results, in both animal models and humans,” said Ganguly.This makes mRNA vaccines safer for patients as they don’t contain infectious material. Some experimental mRNA vaccines against certain cancers and allergies are in early stage clinical trials, but none have been approved for use.“For its messenger RNA vaccine, Moderna uses lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles (LPNs), which are known messengers with established safety. In India, Gennova Pharmaceuticals has also developing an mRNA vaccine, which it will use with its patented carrier lipid iron oxide (LION) and an adjuvant known as GLA-SE,” said Ganguly.Gennova Pharmaceuticals has conducted experiments ... and obtained very high neutralizing antibody titres,” said Ganguly. A senior company official declined comment, saying the work was in its early stages.The US pharma company Pfizer, is working on four nucleic acid vaccines, of which three are mRNA; the other one contains self- amplifying mRNA. Pfizer collaborated with a German company, BNTECH, to identify the most viable candidates and tests are underway in Germany and the US. The DNA vaccine developed by INVIO Pharmaceuticals work is in phase I /II trials at the International Vaccine Institute in South Korea..There is no approved vaccine for Sars-CoV2, although around 120 vaccine candidates are in various stages of clinical trial. “If mRNA-1273 is successful, it should be ready for commeriail use by January next year,” said Ganguly.Moderna’s vaccine will be produced by the US government and Swiss contract drugmaker, Lonza Group, which has said it will produce one billion doses a year. “We are investing to scale up manufacturing so we can maximize the number of doses we can produce to help protect as many people as we can from Sars-CoV-2,” Moderna Chief Executive Officer, Stéphane Bancel said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/faster-vaccines-likely-if-moderna-effort-succeeds/story-Lvc7kBvUe9fzvmhPkmKoPI.html
20-05-2020||India||TikTok faces criticism as NCW leads calls for ban over hate content||TikTok, a video-sharing social networking site owned by Chinese firm ByteDance, where millions of Indians post short videos of just about anything is in the midst of a storm with the National Commission of Women and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh both turning their guns on it. Rekha Sharma, the chairperson of the National Commission for Women said that several videos of women being abused have beein shared on the platform. She said on Twitter that she is of the strong opinion that the platform should be banned She added that the app was also “pushing youngsters towards unproductive life where they are living only for few followers”She said her attention was drawn to a video where a person seemed to be throwing acid on a girl. “We wrote to TikTok to take it down and they cooperated. Soon, we were shown hundreds of videos, with abusive content; videos inferring rape, domestic abuse and molestations. We got in touch with TikTok and showed them some more of the videos; we are waiting for their response,” said Sharma. The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh’s paper, Organiser, in an editorial accused TikTok of enabling Chinese propaganda, harbouring Islamic terrorism and of allowing Muslim men to flout safety measures. “TikTok’s censorship rules which allows all such content is very sensitive when it comes to China. It is clear that it censors posts in India that mention China or Tibet. It is known that TikTok, a video-sharing social networking service, is owned by a Chinese company called ByteDance. However, it is very concerning that the company which is concerned only about China is allowing violent content including videos that glorify rape, acid attacks and terrorism,” the editorial read. On Twitter, Delhi BJP spokesperson Tajinder Pal Bagga, too, called for a ban of the platform, and urged BJP leader Maneka Gandh, also an animal activist, to take action against videos showing cruelty to animals. The calls for ban have been accompanied by hundreds of users down-voting the app on the Android Playstore and it went from being rated 4 stars to 2 stars in a matter of two days. An online petition to have the app banned has been initiated and the petitioner Abhiemanyu Anand Tyagi says that the platform promotes “love jihad”, “religious conversions”, “corona carriers”, “child sex abuse”, “rape threats”. A TikTok spokesperson said that the platform clearly outlines in its terms of service and community guidelines what is not acceptable on our platform. It’s Twitter profile described the platform as “just an anti-fake news account”. “Keeping people on TikTok safe is a top priority and as per the policy, we do not allow content that risks safety of others, promotes physical harm or glorifies violence against women. The behaviour in question violates our guidelines and we have taken down content, suspended the account, and are working with law enforcement agencies as appropriate,” the TikTok spokesperson said.A senior official of the IT ministry said that the ministry usually deals with individual complaints of content on any platform, after which it asks the platform to take it down. “Law enforcement agencies sometimes inform us about disturbing content, and we get in touch with the company to take it down,” said the official. Banning a platform, the official said, is rare. “If a platform routinely flouts norms, and does not take down content, then it can invite serious action from the Centre,” added this person who asked not to be named. TikTok India has courted several controversies earlier. Last year in July, an RSS-affiliate, the Swadeshi Jagran Manch, wrote to the Centre asking for a new law to test and regulate apps like TikTok as India does not have any regulations to monitor any illegal activity on such platforms. Last month, TikTok clocked 2 billion users globally, and said there are 611 million users in India; most of them were on Android platforms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tiktok-faces-criticism-as-ncw-leads-calls-for-ban-over-hate-content/story-teLpPZtz5MpdpfFt1rv0kO.html
20-05-2020||India||‘Mutations in virus not specific to India,’ says Harsh Vardhan||The Sars-CoV-2 viruses causing coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has three major strains, but no key mutation specific to India has been found that affects infectiveness or disease severity, said Minister of Health and Science & Technology Dr Harsh Vardhan in his first interview after Covid-19 cases crossed 100,000 in India on Monday. He said calibrated lockdowns and public health measures have delayed the peaking of the curve in India and prevented the dramatically high numbers predicted by several modelling studies, but warned that how the pandemic progresses now will depend on how closely people follow mobility restrictions, social isolation and personal hygiene norms. Edited excerpts:When is the pandemic expected to peak in India?We have successfully managed to delay the peaking of the curve by imposing lockdown and other public health measures in a timely manner. There are several mathematical models which are predicting the course of the pandemic in India, but till now, we have managed to avoid the dramatically high numbers that they predicted. Right now, with the calibrated lockdowns being implemented, we have tried to contain the spread of infection. It is difficult to predict numbers as they will depend on the adherence of restrictions on mobility and intermingling, observance of personal hygiene, and prevention of exposure to infection by people in different areas. Additionally, it will also depend on the proportion of those infected among migrants and travellers from outside and within.Has community transmission begun in India?The World Health Organization (WHO) has defined four stages of Covid-19 outbreak: Countries with no cases, countries with sporadic cases; countries with clusters; and countries experiencing larger outbreaks of local transmission (community transmission). How large is an outbreak that constitutes a community transmission has not been defined by WHO, so what people refer to as community transmission differs from country to country.In India, the virus has come from foreign sources through travellers coming from outside. We generally consider a case to be a ‘case of community transmission’ when there is no clarity on the source of origin of the infection in a new community. Let me explain again. Community spread in India would mean that cases are occurring in people who did not have any known contact with travellers from overseas infected countries. However, this is not happening, implying that there is no community transmission in India.Although there are some clusters of local spread, the numbers being reported are not indicative of community transmission, which would have likely resulted in a larger number of cases given the expanded testing. Central teams have been deployed in 10 states witnessing a high burden of cases to investigate the sites with higher transmission. In addition, 69 districts will be brought under surveillance to understand the burden and disease trends in greater detail.Is India prepared for the projected rise in cases after work and travel restrictions end?India has massively scaled up all aspects of preparedness. There are around 535 laboratories across the country, more than one lakh samples are tested per day, and 24,04,267 people have been tested. The testing strategies are constantly being examined in light of emerging evidence. India has also developed ELISA-based antibody testing kits, which will provide testing alternatives.India now has the capacity to produce over 250,000 PPE units every day. This expansion of capacity is a real success story as we were entirely dependent on imported PPEs in the pre-pandemic period. We have also scaled up the availability of hospital beds, and oxygen supply linked beds, to enable supportive treatment of Covid-19 patients. While there are sufficient ventilators, our goal is to prevent patients from going on ventilators because the global experience shows that once patients go on ventilators, the mortality rate is very high.Overall, we are focusing on preparedness in the community (physical distancing, phased relaxation of lockdown), augmenting healthcare facilities (more beds, oxygen support, ICU) and public health management measures (surveillance, testing) to ensure that a holistic plan is in place to combat the threat of resurgent infections once the lockdown is lifted in a phased manner at varying levels in different districts.How many genomic sequences of SARS-CoV2 has India submitted to the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID)?India has contributed around 226 genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 so far to the around 25,000 sequences of SARS-CoV-2 that have been shared with unprecedented speed via GISAID. A 1,000-genome sequencing initiative has been launched by Department of Biotechnology (DBT), and 500 are being sequenced by the Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR).What are the findings? Are there any key mutations in the SARS-CoV2 virus causing disease in India?The key mutations in SARS-Cov-2 virus have been found in spike glycoprotein (D614G, G1124V), nucleocapsid (R203K, G204R), RNA dependent RNA Polymerase (P323L) . The circulating viruses in India belong to three major strains. The majority of our samples belong to A2a and about 15% to A3 genotypes. There are a few samples belonging to genotypes B, B1, B4, and A1a. They do not have any mutation that has been reported to be associated with any disease progression or acquisition so far. So, despite the fact that no key mutation specific to India has been found in the virus and it still continues to be an imported virus strain, we cannot afford to be complacent. We have to remain vigilant and continue tracking the virus to identify emerging quasi-species or strains.How many states have the SARS-CoV2 genetic samples been sequenced from? Is there any difference in the strains causing infections across states?Sequences are currently mostly from Kerala, Karnataka, West Bengal, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh -- most belong to A2a clade, while some belong to A3 and B1 clades. It is too early to detect major differences. We are trying for a systematic study of viral RNA sequence from different zones of India and correlate with disease severity.What has been the role of government institutions in the Covid-19 response, including diagnostic, drug and vaccine development?The focus is on self-reliance. We have ramped up our capacity for developing Indigenous testing kits. From being completely dependent on imports, we now have over 20 indigenous manufacturers with a diagnostic kit production capacity of nearly 50 lakh kits per month getting ready by the end of May. This includes indigenous components and reagents.The government’s role has been very proactive in supporting innovation for vaccine development, development of cost-effective diagnostic equipment , as well as drug discovery and repurposing. The Covid Consortium, under DBT-BIRAC (Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council), has supported 70 projects under various categories of vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics. Support has been also given to medical devices such as ventilators and equipment such as PPEs, N-95 masks etc, and for drugs and vaccine development. Funding start-ups that offer immediate solutions has been fast-tracked to address the Covid challenge.Some US studies have found hydroxychloroquine to be ineffective against Covid-19? What is India’s experience?The recent study from New York which failed to find any mortality benefits associated with the use of hydroxychloroquine is a retrospective cohort study. There are several caveats in the study which need to be accounted for. First, the design of the study precludes attribution of the causal effect of the use of hydroxychloroquine on the disease outcomes. Second, the recipients of the drug were already suffering from severe disease, thus making the comparative sample groups unfair. Third, the best effect of hydroxychloroquine based strategy is seen when initiated in the mild to moderate disease stage. Several clinical trials are underway, and once their results are declared, we shall have definite evidence of the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine.Several studies are also underway in India, and as the results emerge, we shall be able to provide more insights into the experiences locally. However, early reports from the pharmacovigilance programme indicate that there are no unexpected spikes of adverse reactions from the use of hydroxychloroquine in the country.What is the progress on the WHO Solidarity Trial in India?In India, we plan to randomise at least 1,500 Covid-19 patients over five to six months. The trial has been initiated with 46 randomised Covid-19 patients, symptomatic adults who have been recently hospitalized and have not yet received hydroxychloroquine. We are not enrolling any asymptomatic Covid-19 patients. The nature of care proposed as part of the randomized trial include providing only local standard of care, administering Remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, Lopinavir / Ritonavir or Lopinavir / Ritonavir with Interferon Beta-1a. So far, around 2,500 people have been randomized globally. Being a five-arm study, large numbers (> 10,000) are required, although there is no cap on sample size. It’s not possible to give timeframe for outcomes as the analysis resulting from these trials is global.Is the effect of BCG vaccination being studied in India?BCG vaccination has been found to be an immunomodulator in malignancies and also protects against certain infectious diseases. Several high-income countries, which do not have routine BCG vaccination in childhood, have initiated clinical trials of BCG in high-risk groups, especially in healthcare workers. Currently, there are two ongoing clinical trials in India. Serum Institute of India (in Pune) is conducting a trial of VPM1002 and Cadila is conducting a trial using mycobacterium indicus pranii. However, we have to keep in mind the fact that India has very high rates of BCG vaccination at birth, and this could be an effect modifier or confounder in the results.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mutations-in-virus-not-specific-to-india-harsh-vardhan/story-eaT55M4k3dLVSnDWs1NXBP.html
20-05-2020||India||Infections rise in four states after migrants return||The return of migrants workers from Delhi and Mumbai, the two worst-hit cities by the Covid-19 pandemic in the country, has led to a spike in the infections in Rajasthan, Karnataka, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, multiple officials in these states said.Migrant workers left jobless by the lockdown imposed to check the pandemic spread in late March have been cycling and walking back to their homes from big cities like Mumbai and Delhi. The number of returnees has gone up since buses in late April and special Shramik trains were arranged from them beginning May 1. As many as 759 migrants have tested positive for Covid-19 since May 1 in Rajasthan. Officials said a majority of them have returned from Mumbai. Barring Jaipur, Kota, Bundi and Ganganagar, migrants have been tested positive for the disease in the rest of 29 Rajasthan districts including Bhilwara, which had reported no infections for almost 20 days.Till now, 5,87,880 migrant workers have returned to Rajasthan and the state has 5,507 Covid-19 cases. Rajasthan’s additional chief secretary (health) Rohit K Singh said they have marked 11 districts as red as they fear an escalation in the number of cases as most migrant workers are expected to return in the coming days. He added they were upgrading medical infrastructure in these districts like Barmer, Udaipur, Bikaner, Bhilwara, Jodhpur and Rajsamand. Singh said a majority of the workers found Covid-19 positive have returned from Mumbai and Gujarat.Bhilwara collector Rajendra Bhatt said 42 migrants have been diagnosed with the disease and a majority of them-- 30--have returned to the district from Mumbai, followed by Gujarat (10) and Madhya Pradesh (2). Migrant workers account for 159 out of 164 Covid-19 cases in Dungarpur and most of them have returned from Mumbai, said district collector Kana Ram. His Pali counterpart, Ansh Deep, said a majority of the infected people in his district, too, have arrived from Mumbai where they worked as vegetable, fruit and ice-cream vendors.Bihar had tested 8,337 out of 5.30 lakh migrants (1.57%) who have returned to the state till Monday.Bihar’s principal secretary (health) Sanjay Kumar said 26% of the migrant workers tested Covid-19 positive have returned from Delhi. “Of the 8,337 samples of migrant tested so far, 651 (8%) have been reported positive...,” Kumar said on Monday. About half of the Covid-19 cases in Bihar (1,392) were migrants who have returned since May 3. As many as 26% of them have come from Delhi followed by 12% from West Bengal, 11% from Maharashtra, 9% from Haryana and 7% from Gujarat. “The health department has been very attentive to the arrival of migrants and [is] analysing data on a continuous basis,” Kumar said. Bihar had received 530,000 migrant workers until Sunday and around a million were expected to return by May 27.According to the Karnataka health department’s data, migrants from Mumbai accounted for 66 of the 99 new cases reported on Monday. A few of the cases were of people, who have returned from Tamil Nadu and Gujarat. Karnataka has reported 1,692 total cases and half of them are those, who have retuned to the state after May 1.Uttar Pradesh has not provided data on how many migrant workers have tested positive, but health officials said a large number of them, who have returned from Delhi and Mumbai, have been diagnosed with the disease.“More than half of the workers, who have tested positive, are from Delhi and about one-fourth from Mumbai. Fortunately, all of them are in quarantine centres and have no symptoms,” said an official in Saharanpur district, who did not want to be named.Gujarat’s southern districts have reported a surge in Covid-19 cases due to the return of migrants from neighbouring Maharashtra. One-third of the total Covid-19 cases in Odisha are migrants who have returned to the state from Gujarat’s Surat. “In districts such as Dang, Narmada and Valsad, many of the new cases are of the persons who have returned from Mumbai or Pune in Maharashtra,” Gujarat health secretary Jayanthi Ravi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/infections-rise-in-four-states-after-migrants-return/story-bBzKZGN49Zm5MgAZtiunNP.html
20-05-2020||India||In Bengal, increase in testing but rise in cases the same||West Bengal’s average daily increase in the number of Covid-19 patients has remained almost the same over the past fortnight even though the testing rate has increased by over three folds, according to an analysis of available data. This has resulted in a sharp decline in the percentage of Covid-19 positive people among those tested for the disease.Between May 5 and 7, the state tested 7,637 samples, averaging 2,545 daily. In those three days, 289 more people tested positive, with an average of 96.3 people daily. But between May 17 and 19, the state tested 24,994 samples, with 8,331 tests daily on an average. During these days, 385 people tested positive, with an average of 128 persons daily. With this, the state has recorded a significant improvement in the percentage of people tested positive for the disease among those tested for it. The percentage stood at 4.87% on May 5. It has since come down to 3.11% on May 17.The state’s ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) claimed that this was because of the state’s success in containing the spread of the disease even as the figures have intrigued a section of doctors.“The data reflects the state’s success in containing the diseases by enforcing a successful lockdown. The people are also to be thanked for maintaining the lockdown,” said Santanu Sen, TMC Rajya Sabha lawmaker. Sen, a doctor, has been one of the important persons in chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s Covid-19 management team.West Bengal Doctors’ Forum secretary Koushik Chaki said the data could be misleading. “This mismatch in the rate of testing and the percentage of people testing positive could have happened due to more testing in the areas lesser affected by the disease. One example is that whereas a good number of tests have been conducted in north Bengal, too few persons tested positive there,” said Chaki. “Whether the infection rate in the state is indeed low can be said only after knowing how much tests have been conducted in the highly-affected districts of Kolkata, Howrah and North 24-Parganas and how many in the containment zones.”Punyabrata Goon, another doctor, said the figures indicate more testing in relatively unaffected areas. “There are hints that the state may have been able to contain the spread but more test reports are needed to say so convincingly.” A health department official, who did not want to be identified, said that the high rate of negative results is also because of pool testing in some pockets of the state, especially north Bengal. “Nearly 11,000 tests were conducted in the districts of Malda and Murshidabad but only 43 cases were reported from these districts.”An Inter-Ministerial Central Team, which visited West Bengal to assess the Covid-19 situation, earlier this month alleged discrepancies in reporting of cases in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-bengal-increase-in-testing-but-rise-in-cases-the-same/story-piKbJxvi5DPG27yzwZKJzO.html
20-05-2020||India||Gujarat Covid tally crosses 12,000-mark||Gujarat, the third worst-hit state by Covid-19, trailing only Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, crossed 12,000 positive cases on Tuesday. Maharashtra has 35,058 confirmed cases of the viral disease and Tamil Nadu 12,448 .Gujarat recorded 395 more positive cases on Tuesday and 25 deaths in the past 24 hours. “Till Tuesday evening 12,141 cases and 719 deaths have been reported,” said Jayanti Ravi, principal secretary (health). “Out of these 25 deaths, 16 deceased had comorbid conditions. Also, 239 people were discharged in the same period. As of now condition of 6,330 patients is stable and 49 are on ventilators,“ she said.Ashwini Kumar, secretary to the chief minister, urged the people of Gujarat to adhere to restrictions that still remain in place after recent lockdown relaxations.Shops only related to essential services would remain open in containment zones and that too only between 9 am and 3 pm, Kumar said. Similarly, in non-containment areas, shops and offices will be open from 7 am to 6 pm on the basis of the odd-even formula. Drug stores, health care and medical facilities will be open 24 hours.Kumar added that a night curfew will be imposed from 6 pm to 8 am across the state which will be implemented very strictly. “All the shifts of employees in all the industries will have to be completed by 06:00 in the evening as per the concession given to start phased industry business in the state. All industrial houses should be vigilant so that employees can reach their homes by 6.00 pm so that there are no cases of curfew violations.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gujarat-covid-tally-crosses-12k-mark/story-5oFBRJWXDRSlHBzkLy6IWP.html
20-05-2020||India||3 Gulf returnees booked for hiding medical history in Kerala||Police have booked three persons in Kollam on Tuesday for allegedly hiding their health status and travelling from the Gulf. They tested positive on their arrival in Kollam medical college hospital and later they reportedly told the police that they had symptoms before their travel. “We have registered cases against them under the Disaster Management Act,” said Kollam rural police superintendent S Harishankar.Now health authorities have asked all travellers who arrived by the Abu Dhabi-Thiruvananhtpuram flight on Sunday to undergo PCR tests immediately.Many complaints have surfaced that people often suppress their fever by taking paracetamol tablets before taking flights to escape thermal scanners, said a senior health official. There are also unconfirmed reports that these three had tested positive during anti-body tests in Abu Dhabi and they were allowed to board the flight in last moment, the three told the police during questioning. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan had termed their behaviour “most irresponsible.” “It is a serious issue. We will take it up with the Union Government and embassies concerned. We have been asking for thorough tests before taking our expatriates. The affected will endanger others also,” the CM had said on Monday. Later police in Kollam (south Kerala) registered cases against them under the disaster prevention act.A 34-year-old nurse from Kuwait, who was cured of the disease in Malappuram in north Kerala, tested positive on Monday. “She landed at Kozhikkode airport from Kuwait with a cured certificate. She was asked to come for a re-test after a week and tested positive again. This is first of its sort in the state but in others parts of the country such cases reported,” said Malappuram district medical officer K Sakeena. She said a special medical board has been constituted to treat her.With 38 flights from foreign countries and 24 trains from other states scheduled to arrive in the next two weeks, the state is bracing for a major surge in cases. Arrivals from West Asian countries and other states led to a surge in active cases from 16 to 130 in last 11 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-gulf-returnees-booked-for-hiding-medical-history-in-kerala/story-bxTAI9BBbPBxs8664NP3FM.html
20-05-2020||India||States should be ready before domestic flights restart: Puri||Civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri on Tuesday said that states should be ready to allow the resumption of regular domestic flight operations as the Centre alone cannot make a decision in this regard. “ In the spirit of cooperative federalism, the govt of states where these flights will take off & land should be ready to allow civil aviation operations,” Puri tweeted. Flight operations have remained suspended since March 25 when the lockdown to check the Covid-19 pandemic was imposed.The government on Sunday lifted several stringent curbs and allowed interstate travel and local transport like buses as it extended the lockdown until May 31. Regular flights will continue to be prohibited across the country. Cargo, medical evacuation, and special flights have operated during the lockdown.The Airports Authority of India has issued guidelines for the resumption of flights in a “graded manner”. It has asked passengers to wear masks, other protective gear and maintain at least four-feet distance from co-passengers whenever the operations resume. Puri has said airport operations are likely to open only in a graded manner with nearly 25-30% of capacity initially. They will be scaled up to their original level in a gradual manner, according to the government’s plan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-should-be-ready-before-domestic-flights-restart-puri/story-lyTj7SwsKim5rDHCmaOXwJ.html
20-05-2020||India||Covid-19 crisis: Is worst yet to come for Maharashtra? Experts weigh in||On Monday night, Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray addressed the state on social media – a much-anticipated speech on the possible easing of lockdown restrictions in the state.That wasn’t to be. Instead, he said, his government will continue to with red zone restrictions in the state and will not ease the lockdown until at least May 31. The reason? The rising number of Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra, and feedback that told him things would have been even worse, possibly “alarming” without the lockdown. Soon after his speech, the state health department released the daily Covid-19 numbers for Maharashtra. In the previous 24 hours, the state had added 2033 new cases, taking the total positives to 35,058. In the same time, authorities recorded 51 deaths. Maharashtra now has 1,249 deaths. This meant that Maharashtra has more than three times the number of cases recorded by Tamil Nadu (11,760), Gujarat (11,746) and Delhi (10,554) – the three states immediately below it in the Covid-19 affected list. Simultaneously, Maharashtra accounts for 39.41% of all Covid-19 fatalities in India (Mumbai’s share in this grim statistic is 23.89%).There are more sobering numbers from Maharashtra: It recorded 20,607 coronavirus cases in the last 14 days (May 5-18), averaging 1471 new cases per day. Mumbai recorded 12,025 cases in the same time, averaging 859 per day. Earlier this week, both Maharashtra and Mumbai reported record one-day spikes (2347 and 1595 cases respectively on May 17).To be sure, a similar trend was observed throughout India during this period; 54% of the country’s 102,287 cases (6 pm, May 19) have been recorded in the last two weeks.State health minister Rajesh Tope indicated earlier this week that the worst is yet to come. “We expect the cases to peak by the end of June,” he said. But some experts differ, saying that it may come down after 14 days (May 31) when the fifth incubation period of the virus will be over. Dr Tatyarao Lahane, director, Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER) said on Tuesday, “We will have to wait for another 14-day incubation cycle to complete (by May 31). After this, the rise is likely to come under control, and we may witness a gradual decline. If it does not reduce then, we may be in the community transmission stage.”He added that state has not reached community transmission stage as there is no exponential growth in the number of fresh cases. For comparison, Maharashtra recorded 24,588 cases in the first 18 days of May, whereas it recorded 10,201 cases in April. It took the state 30 days to reach 1000 cases, but only 23 more for 10,000.The numbers, while on a rising trajectory, have not resulted in a high death rate. On April 12, Maharashtra and Mumbai recorded the highest mortality rate of the pandemic – 7.52% and 7.09% respectively. On May 18, this dropped to 3.56% and 3.55%. India’s overall mortality rate is 3.1%.Maharashtra’s testing rate has also risen dramatically in a month. On April 14, the state was testing at an average of 290 per million population. However, on May 19, according to Maharashtra Medical Education and Drugs Department data, the testing rate had risen to 2409 per million. Tamil Nadu is testing at 4463 per million, according to the state’s health department.Dr Satyajit Rath, retired scientist from the Delhi-based National Institute of Immunology and adjunct faculty at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Pune, said, “It is always good to test more. But the fact remains that the crucial time to be testing extensively was in the early stages of the epidemic when outbreak control was much more feasible. Now, we have established local transmission. While it remains very important to test a lot, increasing overall testing numbers by itself may not have a big effect on slowing down transmission rates in local events.”Another scientist, Abhay Chowdhary, agrees. Dr Chowdhary is the head of the department of microbiology at Navi Mumbai-based DY Patil University and former director of Haffkine Institute for Training, Research and Testing. “Even though the state is running more tests, individuals are violating physical distancing rules, for instance, in containment zones. As a result, those infected get mixed with the healthy population,” said Chowdhary on Tuesday. “This is more worrisome in the case of those who are suffering from existing ailments. Even if 1-2% individuals have co-morbid conditions, it will put an immense strain on the state’s health care infrastructure.”The state government said last week that it has resolved to make the entire state a green zone by the end of the month(currently there are 18 red zone districts). This seems unlikely as, according to the health minister Rajesh Tope, “all the predictions about Mumbai and Maharashtra have not come true. The numbers are rising and we feel that the peak is yet to come.According to our mathematical models, the number of cases in Mumbai will likely be four times the current figure by the end of June. We are trying to prevent it, but have to be prepared for the worst and hope for the best.”Dr Rath says one of the hurdles to get more testing is the paucity of labs.But that the biggest failure may have been the underfunding of our health care system. “We have underfunded our public health system and starved it of resources for a long time; a problem that we cannot now fix overnight. I can only hope that we do not forget this mistake once the pandemic passes.”(With inputs from Faisal Malik)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cases-still-rising-maha-braces-for-covid-peak/story-VY6xO8X1oYdGmNVabEZiQO.html
20-05-2020||India||22 migrant workers killed in road accidents across 5 states||Twenty-two people were killed in separate road accidents in five states on Tuesday, taking the death toll in such incidents involving migrant labourers to at least 162 during the lockdown imposed to stop the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Nine people died in Bihar, four in Maharashtra, six in two separate accidents in Uttar Pradesh, one in Jharkhand, and two in as many incidents in Odisha, according to state officials.The accident in Bihar’s Bhagalpur took place when a truck with the migrants rammed a bus, which too was carrying labourers who returned on a Shramik Special train on Monday night. Four passengers in the bus, which was on the way to Banka district from Darbhanga, suffered injuries. The truck, which was carrying iron poles, skidded off the road and fell into a ditch after the collision on NH-31 around 4am. The nine victims sitting atop were buried under the poles, Bhagalpur district magistrate Pranav Kumar said. According to the documents found in their possession, they were residents of east and west Champaran districts. Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar expressed grief over the accident and announced a compensation of ~4 lakh to family members of each victim. In Maharashtra’s Yavatmal district, three migrant labourers and a bus driver were killed and 22 others injured after their vehicle hit a stationary truck early on Tuesday, the police said. Among those injured, 17 were reported to be in a serious condition.The accident took place at Kolwan village around 3.30am, when the bus was on its way from Solapur to the Nagpur railway station. The labourers were going there to board a Shramik Special train to reach their home towns in Jharkhand, additional superintendent of police Noorul Hasan said. The bus driver lost control and the vehicle hit a stationary truck carrying road construction material, he said. In UP, two separate accidents involving migrant workers were reported. In the first incident, a truck carrying labourers overturned on the Jhansi-Mirzapur highway, killing three women — between 30 and 38 years — and leaving 17 others injured, the police said. The accident took place at Mahuva crossing in Mahoba district. The labourers had returned from Delhi and boarded the truck near Harpalpur along the Madhya Pradesh border. The truck fell into a roadside ditch after a tyre burst. In the second accident, three workers travelling in a car were killed when their vehicle rammed a stationary mini-truck in Azamgarh district. Superintendent of police Trivedi Singh said: “The accident took place in Jameendashav village under Atraulia police station when the driver of the car dozed off. As a result, he lost control over the car and rammed it into a stationary mini-truck.”In Odisha’s Angul district, the driver of an LPG tanker was charred to death when a bus carrying 26 migrants on its way to West Bengal from Mumbai rammed into the tanker . At least 12 migrants sustained injuries.A migrant worker of Balasore sitting atop a iron sheet-laden truck was killed when the vehicle hit another truck parked in front of a marine products export company. Another migrant worker killed as the trolley he was travelling in was hit by truck.According to data collected by HT reporters, at least 162 migrants have died in such accidents since the beginning of the lockdown on March 25. In the past fortnight alone, 42 migrant labourers have died in two major accidents. On May 8, a goods train ran over 16 people who were sleeping on the tracks in Maharashtra’s Aurangabad on their way back to their village in MP on foot. Then on May 16, 26 workers died after the truck they were travelling in rammed another vehicle in Uttar Pradesh’s Auraiya district.The nationwide lockdown left migrant workers without jobs and a way to get back home. It was only in late April that some states started transporting their workers back from other states using buses and only on May 1 that the government started running special trains for them. In a communication to states on Tuesday, the Union home ministry asked states and Union Territories to operate more Shramik Special trains in coordination with Indian Railways to ferry the migrants. “I appeal state governments to help the migrants, register their names and provide the list to the railways. I also appeal the migrants to stay where they are, and the Indian Railways will soon help them reach their hometowns,” said railway minister Piyush Goyal.

20-05-2020||Today's||Old ways have to give way to new. Set up permanent community kitchens | Opinion||These days our country faces the twin challenge of feeding lakhs and lakhs of poor people driven out of work in urban areas due to the coronavirus pandemic and ensuring the safe return of these labourers and keep them in quarantine centres for 14 days as per the protocol laid down by Health Authorities before they are allowed to reach their homes in rural areas.The other day, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman mentioned that the central government has released Rs 11,000 crore to states as part of the Centre’s contribution to State Disaster Relief Fund (SDRF) to deal with the situation which includes provision of cooked food thrice a day to lakhs of poor migrant workers.Depending on which side of the political spectrum they represent, hearts of representatives of all political parties bled for the poor and destitute representing the ‘soul of India’!This was mostly in response to visuals played by the electronic media. Some of these reports were focused on the plight of migrant labourers put up in quarantine centres in several states who had not been provided ‘proper’ food or clean water. Others put the spotlight on the migrant labourers traversing on foot with their families in tow in the scorching summer with little or nothing to eat.We have also seen how some of the gurdwaras across cities, NGOs, volunteers associated with various organisations have also chipped in and used the ‘community kitchen’ infrastructure and the well-established ‘supply chain’ to serve quality food to a large number of urban poor and migrant labourers.But state agencies have mostly faltered in their efforts to serve cooked food in this time of crisis despite their efforts. No government wants people walking hundreds of kilometres to their homes in rural areas. Or the arrangements made at quarantine centres crumbling under pressure playing out on national television. Yet this happened. Why?The short answer is that India’s administrative system is not designed, trained or equipped to undertake this task. Despite 73 years of Independence, the revenue department and the district administration headed by the Collector are ill-equipped to perform this task. Even when clear orders along with substantial funds are released to set up relief centres or quarantine centres, the district authorities generally zero in on school buildings – ubiquitous primary school buildings in rural areas and government secondary school buildings and such other infrastructure in urban areas. These generally have one India Mark II handpump and a set of 4 toilets for children with or without running water facilities in rural areas, and perhaps piped water supply and some more toilet sets in secondary schools in urban areas. There may be ceiling fans and tube lights but electricity supply in rural areas would largely be erratic. There is certainly no facility for cooking food for hundred or more persons who may be lodged there.Now apart from making arrangements of procuring folding cots, bedding etc from the local ‘tent house’, the urban and village level functionaries also have to procure cooking vessels, gas cylinders, gas stove and trained cooks and their helpers who will stay and prepare food apart from arranging cooking material ranging from wheat flour, rice, pulses, salt, cooking oil, vegetables, tea, sugar, milk and the like. Lighting arrangements also need to be made at the place where food will be cooked for hundreds of persons and tens of cooks and helpers will stay. If only, all these could be done at the ‘click’ of the button.In a vast and diverse country like ours, we need to institutionalise the system of running community kitchens because we keep facing problems of this kind in varying degrees every now and then. In rural areas, ‘community kitchens’ with mechanised cooking facilities must be set up by the government in each gram panchayat under the control of Gram Panchayat. This facility can be used to prepare mid-day meals for school children and children attending Anganwadi centres which also now double up as pre-school centres. So every day, this ‘panchayat community kitchen’ can be used to provide cooked food to children attending anganwadi centres, schools and may be, just about anyone who is prepared to pay Rs 10 for a meal. Gram panchayats should receive subsidised grains and funds earmarked for ‘conversion cost’ under the mid-day meal scheme and Mission Poshan. It should be the responsibility of the gram panchayat to ensure that no one sleeps on an empty stomach in the village. This facility will also come handy when a region faces natural disasters such as floods or the pandemic being faced today. Organising community kitchens in urban centers will have to be set up similarly under the municipal authorities.It is time to empower and strengthen community and local governments to enable them effectively respond to natural disasters be it floods, earthquakes or health pandemics.

20-05-2020||Editorials||Supporting the unemployed| HT Editorial||India was in the middle of an economic slowdown before the pandemic. With the coronavirus, and the national lockdown imposed to curb its spread, the slowdown has potentially turned into a recession. The government’s announcement of ₹20 lakh crore package is an acknowledgment of the crisis at hand.One key way in which this crisis is getting reflected is in the unemployment figures. Even before the pandemic, India was staring at relatively high unemployment — an official report indicated a 6% unemployment rate in 2017-18, the highest in 45 years. Over 12 million people enter the workforce every year, and India has struggled to create new jobs. This trend has now got accelerated. According to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), the unemployment rate was 24% in the week ending May 17. Its April data shows that it was predominantly small traders and labourers, followed by entrepreneurs, and then salaried employees who lost their jobs. This is not surprising. If factories and shops are closed, if daily wage labourers and street vendors can’t work, if companies begin losing revenues drastically, there will be job losses. The problem is that the easing of the lockdown will not immediately restore these jobs.That is why a key component of any relief package has to take into account this rising unemployment. By pumping in an additional Rs 40,000 crore into the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), the government is hoping to create a financial buffer for those who have returned home to their villages. And by unveiling structural reforms, it hopes to get the economy kickstarted. But this will not solve the immediate crisis — where people, in the absence of jobs, don’t have incomes, which, in turn, makes basic livelihood difficult. The poor will get most severely affected, but so will large sections of the middle class who are staring at salary cuts or job losses, which will reduce their purchasing power and ability to take and pay loans sharply. This, in turn, will have an impact across a range of sectors. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman has said that she is open to suggestions and, as the year progresses, there will be more measures. India will have to look more carefully at both the United States, which is offering a generous unemployment allowance, and the United Kingdom, which has offered wage support to workers. There will be issues of resources, and identifying and targeting beneficiaries. But India may, sooner than later, need to introduce an unemployment allowance to help citizens overcome this crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/supporting-the-unemployed/story-jtN7guH1OUKvLrVuxgESdI.html
20-05-2020||Editorials||Centre’s Covid-19 report card: It recognised the threat, but slipped on migrants, economy||Fifty-five days after India went in for arguably the most stringent lockdown in the world, the country opened up substantially on Tuesday, though the lockdown has been officially extended to May 31. This is a good moment to evaluate what the Centre did right, and what it got wrong in this period.Here is where the Narendra Modi government was right. One, it understood the gravity of the challenge posed by the coronavirus pandemic, did not underplay the threat, and emphasised the need for precautions and social distancing. Two, despite the economic costs, it took the right decision in imposing a lockdown on March 25 — the country needed it then to reduce the spread of the infection and prepare the health infrastructure. Three, once it recognised the importance of masks and personal protective equipment (PPE), it scaled up domestic production. Four, it recognised the centrality of the states in this battle, with Mr Modi regularly consulting chief ministers and taking into account their inputs. Five, the prime minister’s messaging by first emphasising lives over livelihoods, and then the need to reconcile both lives and livelihoods — as it became clear that the pandemic was here to stay — was important. And finally, it behaved responsibly by helping countries in need, and not using this moment to score geopolitical points. Where did the government go wrong? One, it underestimated the desire of migrant workers to return home, causing one of the most severe humanitarian crises India has seen. It was inconsistent regarding their travel policy, didn’t provide adequate safety nets, and was insensitive when reports of them walking home emerged. Two, it slipped on the health front — by, first, having limited testing criteria, testing at low numbers for long, and not providing enough PPE in the early stages. It is not clear if India still has the infrastructure in case there is a surge in cases. Three, it greatly delayed the economic package — and when the package was announced, it did not have a strong enough component to stimulate demand and provide immediate relief. Four, the Centre did not do enough to support the states financially. Five, it has been sporadic and often not transparent in its communication, particularly on the spread of the disease. And finally, in the enforcement of the lockdown, the security apparatus often used excessive force and violated guidelines of the government itself. As India prepares for the next phase in the battle, it should build on the strengths and remedy the weaknesses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/centre-s-covid-19-report-card-it-recognised-the-threat-but-slipped-on-migrants-economy/story-kayTT0y6DX21YNSt4wieOL.html
20-05-2020||Editorials||Lipu Lekh Pass: Nepal should reconcile to reality | HT Editorial||There has been a dip in the relationship between India and Nepal in the past month. Two issues have contributed to it. The first was an internal rift within the Nepal Communist Party (NCP) where Prime Minister (PM) KP Sharma Oli faced a challenge from senior party leaders and former PMs, Pushpa Kamal Dahal “Prachanda” and Madhav Kumar Nepal. The crisis was defused after China mediated a deal between the leaders. If there were any doubts about the Chinese investment in the NCP and backing for Mr Oli, it was dispelled. Delhi noted the development, quietly. The second, more public, episode has been the controversy over the border. India inaugurated a road that crosses through Lipu Lekh Pass, part of an area both countries claim as their own. There is a long history to claims and counter-claims, but what is relevant is this. India possesses the territory; it sees it strategically important; and it will continue to expand infrastructure. The issue is, however, a subject of ultra-nationalist politics in Nepal. Mr Oli’s own nationalist politics (which seems to disappear when it comes to China), and domestic political opinion resulted in Kathmandu taking a strong position. While Beijing supports Mr Oli in general, domestic factors are driving Nepal’s rhetoric on this issue. In fact, India and China, in 2015, agreed to have trade across the pass, an acknowledgement by Beijing of India’s control over the area. Nepal should reconcile to the status quo and stop its anti-India rhetoric. India can offer a diplomatic sop by agreeing to start a dialogue on border issues. But Delhi must be vigilant, and keep a check on the Chinese-backed Oli regime.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/lipu-lekh-pass-nepal-should-reconcile-to-reality/story-8d15NFCuAvcaG3WJoebf6H.html
