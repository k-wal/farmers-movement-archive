That Covid-19 affects the respiratory system is known; in its milder form, which is the case in more than 80% of those infected, it causes fever, sore throat, cough, and body aches that abate over a couple of weeks without any treatment. But some of these cases may get serious because of pneumonia, leading to breathlessness, which may need ventilator support. Many of these patients don’t survive. Over the last six weeks, doctors have realised that Covid-19 also affects the heart in many ways, leading to the creation of treatment protocols by several national societies to manage cardiac cases during the Covid-19 pandemic.It is now evident that patients with pre-existing heart diseases, previous heart attacks, or low-pumping efficiency of the heart (heart failure) are at a greater risk of developing serious Covid-19 infection. Those above 60 years with hypertension or diabetes have a five times greater risk of dying from it. On the other hand, even a mild coronavirus infection can lead to the worsening of previously stable heart disease, needing urgent medical care for stabilisation. Therefore, heart patients must protect themselves from Covid-19 by social distancing, wearing masks, washing hands, and using sanitisers. Heart patients also need to maintain a healthy lifestyle during the lockdown by following indoor exercise and yoga regimes, a healthy diet, sleeping, engaging in recreational activities, taking medications regularly, and staying positive. Going forward, these protective habits should become the new normal lifestyle.There has been a realisation that the virus can affect the heart in previously healthy individuals. The virus can cause severe inflammatory responses in the body that affect the arteries and, in addition, cause an increased tendency for clotting. This can lead to heart attacks and strokes, and these can occur in a younger age groups. The virus can also infect the heart muscle, causing myocarditis, which can be confused with a heart attack. This leads to decreased pumping efficiency of the heart, acute heart failure, shock, heart rate, and rhythm irregularities, and in rare instances, sudden death. This heart muscle injury is seen in 20%-30% of Covid-19 patients hospitalised with breathing problems, and is reflected in markedly raised levels of a commonly available blood marker (Troponin I) test and contributes to 50% of the deaths. Such serious patients require advanced in-hospital supportive care. Experts agree that patients getting admitted now with acute cardiac problems should be tested to exclude the coronavirus. Following recovery from Covid-19, those with myocarditis may recover over weeks, but knowledge of this is limited.Finally, there is an intriguing paradox observed during this pandemic that has implications for heart patients. Hospitals around the world including India have noted an approximately 50% decrease in the admission of patients with acute heart attacks, a medical emergency requiring life-saving treatment. Cardiologists have debated on the causes for this. While pollution-free and stress-free lifestyles during the lockdown could have resulted in lower heart attack rates, the inability to reach hospitals for treatment because of movement restrictions could be another reason. But the biggest concern across the world seems to be that despite their heart condition deteriorating, many patients may be delaying medical attention and treatment because they are scared to go to the hospital for the fear of being infected by the coronavirus. Evidence of this has been seen in Europe and the United States, where everyone calls for an ambulance in case of medical emergencies, and accurate and centralised data is maintained of all medical events in the community. While there are fewer acute heart attack cases being admitted to hospital emergency units, there is a marked increase in deaths from cardiac arrest at home , probably due to the postponement and delay in seeking medical attention. It is, therefore, important to emphasise that heart patients must not ignore any deterioration in symptoms and/or delay medical attention. Telemedicine consultation is now possible with most doctors for immediate advice. Furthermore, heart patients should feel reassured that the hospitals are open, doctors are working, and the medical facilities are safe places with well-defined protocols laid down for both elective and emergency treatment to keep the patients protected from infection. So the clear message is: No heart patient should delay or postpone any treatment due to undue fears over Covid-19 if the need arises. Timely treatment saves lives.While we fight the coronavirus together and take care of Covid-19 patients, millions of heart patients should be reassured that their safety remains a priority for those of us in the medical profession.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/heart-patients-should-not-delay-hospital-visits-due-to-covid-19-fears/story-RWTeQcdu8ircUCZn2xYijL.html
03-05-2020||News||Covid-19: In times of crisis, women self-help groups lead the way||As India fights the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), it requires all stakeholders to take charge and deliver. Among those which are working on the ground, the women-led self-help groups (SHGs) have emerged as effective frontline responders, reaching the last-mile and ensuring an immediate relief and socio-economic protection to the country’s most vulnerable.Their reach is staggering: Approximately 67 million women are organised into 6 million SHGs. Operating on the principles of self-help, cohesion and mutual interest, SHGs are voluntary groups of 10-20 women from their neighbourhood, who pool their savings and gain access to credit. As of today, these collectives have saved $1.4 billion, and leveraged another $37 billion from commercial banks. What began as a call to empower poor rural women under the aegis of the Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana-National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM) has since grown into one of the world’s largest institutional platforms for the poor.To facilitate the workings of SHGs, the Union ministry of rural development issues policy directions and advisories to state missions.SHGs have local as well as national reach. They are producing masks and personal protective equipments (PPEs), creating awareness about the pandemic, and delivering essentials goods and financial assistance to the most vulnerable.For example, in Bihar, women under the JEEViKA platform (the State Rural Livelihood Mission) are active in identifying and surveying vulnerable households. Using innovative communication methods, SHG members ensure that the risks of Covid-19 and its transmission are easily explained to rural masses. Using the information education and communication material developed by the state mission, the didis, as they are locally called, use the network of 1.4 lakh state-wide SHGs to create awareness about hand-washing, social distancing, sanitation and quarantine.In Uttar Pradesh (UP), with the help of Khadi Gramudyog, SHG members plan to produce masks worth six lakh metres of khadi fabric. In Kheri district, SHGs are working round-the-clock to produce PPE kits for frontline health workers and police personnel. Moreover, SHG women under the Prerna platform use methods such as rangolis, TikTok videos and songs to create awareness about hand-washing and social distancing.In Jharkhand, SHG women use the Aajeevika Farm Fresh mobile app to sell vegetables, ensuring that social distancing guidelines are not flouted. They also use their networks to identify vulnerable households, flagging to the administration the pockets in need of food. They help run a 24-hour helpline by the State Rural Livelihood Mission (SRLM), which provides important information and counselling to the returning migrant. Every Panchayat in the state has a Muhkya Mantri Didi Kitchen, which provides free food to the needy. At present, the state has about 4,185 community kitchens in as many Panchayats, with SRLM providing Rs 20,000 each to SHGs running these centres.In Kerala, through the renowned Kudumbashree network, women collectives have been on the frontlines, home-delivering groceries through a floating market to the most vulnerable, providing PPEs to local government hospitals, and running 1,300 community kitchens across the state. They also help in Covid-19-related myth-busting.In several states, SHGs have taken up the task of production, packaging and distribution of take-home ration (THR) as anganwadi centres across the country are shut due to the lockdown. In Odisha and Chhattisgarh, the SHG women also distribute eggs along with THR. This ensures that the State reaches every child under five, pregnant women, lactating mothers, and vulnerable target groups.In many states, SHG members engaged as BC Sakhi (banking correspondent agents) help home-deliver the Centre’s financial relief packages for the rural community facing socio-economic distress, pensioners, and those who are dependent on the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act.There are four main reasons why SHGs play an important role in serving the poor:One, they have a better understanding of local communities, and in times of crises, have immediate access on the ground.Two, they serve as an integral community communication channel, help reach the last mile, and are trusted by local communities.Three, they can provide short- and medium-term social and economic protection, serving as a critical conduit for providing relief to the most vulnerable.Four, they quickly set up the production of relevant items using their well-honed skills, and put to use village distribution and supply chains.As we celebrate and acknowledge their contributions in tackling the coronavirus pandemic, we must continue to strengthen them, and replicate the model across the country. They must be given a requisite economic and social empowerment. Governments and society must recognise that effective emergency response and the social and economic protection of the most vulnerable is critically dependent on institutions like SHGs.Nita Kejrewal is joint secretary, ministry of rural developmentThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/covid-19-in-times-of-crisis-women-self-help-groups-lead-the-way/story-SyXJVNPLUdVbSljkeaeszN.html
03-05-2020||News||We need social solidarity, not social distancing||Leadership plays a crucial role in times of crises. In confronting unprecedented challenges such as the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), proper messaging is essential to galvanise people. In the Indian context, apart from region, language and faith, social diversity also plays an important role. The growing consciousness on social diversity is a significant step in dealing with exclusion and incidents of discrimination on the basis of birth. Therefore, any strategy to contain a crisis of this proportion must be inclusive.When Prime Minister Narendra Modi used “physical distancing” instead of “social distancing” in Mann Ki Baat, it started a debate in India. In a deeply hierarchical society with traditional prejudices, social exclusion may masquerade as “social distancing”. That made intellectual leaders from the subaltern communities across the country question the term “social distancing”.Not only in India, but voices from across the world challenged the usage of the term. Socially marginalised and racially segregated people, who are unfortunately at the bottom of the pyramid, unequivocally discarded the term “social distancing”. Rising international concerns eventually made the World Health Organization advocate for the use of the term “physical distancing”.Caste still remains a fundamental component of the national conversation. It plays an instrumental role in shaping the structures of power and influence. Government data on social atrocities, published by the National Crime Records Bureau, recognises it as a cardinal source of tension in both rural and urban areas. The term “social distancing”, therefore, smells of archaic practices perpetuating casteism. Noted thinker on Dalit issues and professor of sociology at the Jawaharlal Nehru University, Vivek Kumar, says, “There is absolutely nothing as a pristine, pure and universal culture. Terms are culturally-specific and, therefore, cultural constructs should also be society-specific. Social distancing in India was maintained during birth, death and menstruation. Social distance is the totality of interactional distancing barring all cultural and physical engagements. Hence, we must not even unconsciously legitimise anything that ends up intensifying social cleavages and conflicts.”There is an imminent threat of social distancing gaining traction in society. Regressive sections might choose to justify traditional social distancing as an effective tool to counter the pandemic. It will be a big dent to the efforts of those who have dedicated their lives for the cause of fairness and equality. Social reform movements against caste and its privileges are as old as Savitri Bai Phule and BR Ambedkar, and that struggle for equality still continues. We must go back to the Constitution’s preamble, which seeks to achieve social justice as the nation’s ultimate virtue.Empathy, sense of compassion and efforts aimed at achieving social solidarity to challenge Covid-19 must be acknowledged and encouraged at all levels. Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief, Mohan Bhagwat, too, in his address to the nation, promoted the term “physical distancing” instead of “social distancing”. The leadership, both at the government- and the civil society-level, has shown that the crisis needs a socially cohesive and comprehensive strategy.India has made substantial progress, with a Dalit in the Rashtrapati Bhawan and a person from a socially-backward community as the country’s prime minister. The collective conscience of the country is at an all-time high. The march towards social justice and equality must compliment the efforts to contain the pandemic without losing credence. To crush the virus, this crisis must be transformed into an opportunity that coalesces the collective will of every Indian – irrespective of caste, creed, gender, and religion.Guru Prakash is assistant professor, Patna University, and fellow, India FoundationThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/we-need-social-solidarity-not-social-distancing/story-QlECWtV9vAU0wOVgTYc3YI.html
03-05-2020||News||A tale of two epidemics – Aids and Covid-19||The global upheaval created by the new strain of coronavirus (Covid-19) reminds us that communicable diseases are always a threat to public health. I look at the coronavirus pandemic with a feeling of déjà vu – with memories of the deadly spread of HIV/Aids just two decades ago fresh in my mind. It consumed more lives and left many more infected than Covid-19 is likely to before it is tamed and eliminated.I see similarities in how countries responded to Aids then and Covid-19 now. While, in case of Aids, it was Africa and the third-world countries that were in denial and bore the brunt of the epidemic, this time around, it is the developed world that has messed up the response to the Covid-19 crisis, despite possessing the scientific and technological prowess to challenge it. During the Aids epidemic in the 1990s, African and Asian countries underestimated the spread of HIV, thanks to the lack of sophisticated epidemiological tools and responsive health systems. But there can be no excuse for the developed world’s complacency and a lack of preparedness in dealing with the coronavirus crisis; they, after all, possess the world’s best information technology-enabled epidemiological surveillance systems to track pandemics.One common challenge that we faced then, and face still now, is to arrive at a credible number of infections. In the case of Covid-19, most countries are tailoring their responses to symptomatic cases or those quarantined for suspected infections. Infectious diseases always have a large number of unreported cases, with people either unaware or frightened to undergo tests. But there are still no organised efforts to bring out a credible number of estimated infections in countries reporting a high number of cases.During the HIV crisis, the process to arrive at an estimated number was developed quite early with help from the United Nations system. India reported less than one lakh HIV infections 20 years after the first case was reported in 1986. But national-level sentinel surveillance conducted in 1998 yielded an estimate of three million infections. This was further refined using new data, but the number was still as high as 2.4 million, 20 times more than the reported cases. This forced the government to recognise the severity of the epidemic and invest resources into a vastly expanded and decentralised national AIDS response in 1999. In the next 10 years, the infection level was brought down by 56%, and the mortality was reduced through an expanded treatment programme covering almost 1.2 million people.It should be epidemiologically possible to initiate national-level sentinel surveillance for Covid-19 in India, to locate if any latent epidemics are occurring in rural and remote areas outside the hot zones identified by states. The integrated disease surveillance programme (IDSP) should be given the mandate to undertake such periodic surveillance with technical inputs from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).Testing is another important component of epidemic control. In the Aids programme, rapid kits introduced in 2,000 had enabled the government to quickly expand testing facilities across the country, which allowed people to get themselves tested and, if required, enrolled in the treatment programme.Similarly, in the case of Covid19, India could easily overcome its initial reluctance to test large numbers. States could gradually expand testing facilities; the numbers, in case they are higher, can be partially explained by scaling up testing. The availability of rapid test kits for quick diagnosis could have enormously helped the programme, but substandard kits from China slowed down the effort. We need to quickly ramp up the indigenous production of rapid kits of standard quality to test the asymptomatic cases. Making kits available for voluntary testing at a very low price will help people access health care services during the early stages of infection.In the 90s, stigma and discrimination associated with HIV positives greatly hindered the response. Health care providers were reluctant to treat them due to the fear of infection, and a lack of universal precautions for infection control in government hospitals which bore the brunt of the epidemic. The big difference this time around is that health care providers at the forefront of the response are being hailed as heroes.But stigma is emerging from society due to an inadequate understanding of the dynamics of the Covid-19 epidemic. Disturbing instances of locals resisting last rites of people dying of Covid-19-related infections point towards the need to normalise the disease. Massive awareness campaigns in the late 90s, with community participation, contributed to a rise in awareness levels about HIV and Aids in the population. Similar efforts are needed now, with strong involvement of communities and persons cured of Covid-19.Unlike HIV, which still infects about 1.5 million persons every year, the immediate threat of Covid-19 may not last more than a year or two. But its impact on the health systems and economies will be more profound than HIV, which was more of a silent tsunami causing unnoticed destruction to vulnerable communities. But even if Covid-19 is controlled, it may not necessarily vanish. Until the mass immunisation of populations becomes possible with a preventive vaccine, we must be prepared for its periodical onslaughts, even if in a less virulent form.

03-05-2020||Delhi||81-year-old dies of Covid-19 after being made to wait 12 hours for an ambulance||An 81-year-old man died of Covid-19 on Wednesday, after being made to wait for nearly 12 hours for an ambulance to arrive after his samples tested positive on Tuesday night, his family members alleged.The man’s son said they spent the excruciating hours, between his test results returning and an ambulance arriving at their Rohini residence, making frantic phone calls to the national Covid helpline, the Delhi helpline, as well as the CATS emergency ambulance number — to absolutely no avail.“We knew of the various helpline numbers. When we called the national helpline number, we were given the Delhi state helpline number. Thereafter, we called the number hundreds of times, but no one would take the call,” the son said.They called the CATS ambulance helpline number multiple times, but no one received their calls, he alleged.He said umpteen tweets to several government officials too went unheeded. Even after an ambulance arrived on Wednesday morning to take him to Lok Nayak hospital, the family alleged that the man was made to wait in the ambulance for nearly an hour, without even being admitted to the hospital. His family claimed he died in the ambulance itself.A government official said, “The man was already dead by the time a doctor arrived at the scene.”Health officials HT spoke to claimed few ambulances were in service, as most drivers had parked their vehicles and did not want to report to duty, for fear of contracting the contagious disease.“We have been trying to persuade ambulance unions to send men to work, but they are refusing. However, while there could be hours of delay in providing ambulance service, we can only assure the patients that they will eventually arrive,” said the official.The official, however, refused to comment on any specific case. Another official from CATS too did not respond to queries related to the alleged delay and death.A nightmare of 12 hoursThe family’s travails began more than two weeks ago when, on April 18, the 81-year-old man, a retired teacher, developed a fever and cough. He lived with five other family members, in Rohini Sector 15, and since the lockdown, only the man’s son would step out to buy essential items.With no inkling that he could have contracted the coronavirus disease, his family gave him medicines for the fever and cough syrup. “We thought it was the usual old-age ailments. The thought that he could be infected with Covid-19 didn’t occur to us,” said his son, a businessman.When his condition didn’t improve, they got in touch with the family physician, who prescribed further general medication.Finally, on Monday, the family got him tested for Covid-19. “On Tuesday, around 10 p, we received his test result that said he was positive,” his son said.Their problems only mounted from here on.Family said they spent the 12 hours desperate, trying everything they possibly could.“For much of that time, my father was speaking to us. He felt weak, but he was alive and conscious. He could have lived had we received timely help,” his son said.“We were afraid to take him to the hospital in our car. We had no protective equipment, except face masks,” he added. The man’s grandson tweeted of their plight, tagging government authorities, but was met with only silence. He finally tweeted on Wednesday morning, “My grandfather is corona positive and there is no reply from govt authorities hence I will take him to hospital”.By Wednesday morning, the family had geared up to move him to hospital in their own car. As a last ditch, they contacted a surveillance officer in the area who helped arrange a CATS ambulance, which arrive around two hours later, the son said.But the ambulance only brought more trouble with it. “Two men wearing PPEs [personal protective equipment] arrived outside our home in an ambulance around 10am, but they asked us to bring my father downstairs from our flat on the second floor. They just refused to help,” he alleged.A video shot by a neighbour showed the elderly man sitting on the staircase as a few members of his family tried to lift him up to take him downstairs. “We decided to ignore our own safety to save my father. The ambulance staff neither helped get my father on the stretcher, nor lift the stretcher into the ambulance,” he alleged.The health official said many of the ambulance staff who continue to provide their services are afraid to go beyond their “basic duties”.The family said that as the ambulance drove away with the sick man, his son and grandson ran back into their home to bathe and decontaminate themselves before driving to the hospital in their car.“When we reached Lok Nayak Hospital, I found my father lying motionless in the ambulance. No one attended to him, and he wasn’t even admitted to the hospital. By the time a doctor arrived, my father had died. The doctor glanced at my father from a distance and declared him dead,” the son alleged.While the hospital refused to comment on the specific incident, a doctor at Lok Nayak Hospital who asked not to be identified, said the standard procedure is to first record the case histories of the patients and their attendants before admitting them. “We are adhering by the guidelines when it comes to admitting patients,” said the doctor.While refusing to comment on this specific case, the health official said it was “unlikely” that a delay in hospitalisation had caused the death. “There is no treatment for this disease. Even at the hospital, there wouldn’t have been much that we could have done to save such a patient,” the official said.As for the dead man’s family, they believe the death was avoidable. “I don’t think my father died of Covid-19. He died due to an avoidable delay,” the son said. He was cremated later in the day.The 81-year-old is survived by his wife, his son, the son’s wife, and two of their children and all five now face a wait for their test results to return.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/81-year-old-dies-of-covid-19-after-being-made-to-wait-12-hours-for-an-ambulance/story-guEdz2oDfTerFfTUmECM1L.html
03-05-2020||Mumbai||Maha govt allows shops selling non-essentials, liquor to open||Liquor shops and establishments dealing in non-essential commodities are allowed to open with certain conditions even in red zones across Maharashtra, the government announced on Sunday via a revised notification. The revision came a day after the state announced it will continue with the stricter norms of the coronavirus-enforced lockdown in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), Pune, Pimpri-Chinchwad and Malegaon. Containment zones in these cities, however, have been excluded from the exemptions. The decision will come into effect from Monday, the beginning of the third phase of the lockdown and which will be in force till May 17.Maharashtra on Sunday reported 678 coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases, taking the total to 12,974. It registered 27 deaths, taking the toll to 548. Of the new cases, 441 were from Mumbai, which also saw 21 deaths on Sunday. Of the other deaths, four were in Pune and one each in Bhiwandi and Navi Mumbai. Fourteen of the patients who died on Sunday were above 60 years of age, while 13 had high-risk comorbidities. The mortality rate in the state stood at 4.23%, down from 7.21% on April 12, but the number of deaths is increasing with 270 deaths in the past ten days. The country’s mortality rate hovers around 3.25%.Excise commissioner Kantilal Umap issued a circular on Sunday announcing that wholesale and retail liquor shops will remain open between 10am and 6pm across the state. The circular has also stated that the manufacturing of liquor in MMR, Pune, Pimpri Chinchwad will not be permitted during the lockdown restrictions.On the lines of the exemptions given by the Centre in the third phase of the lockdown, the state has extended relaxations to commercial and industrial activities in the big cities too.According to the notification issued on Saturday, Maharashtra government had, contrary to the Central order, continued the restrictions in these activities. By revising it on Sunday, the state has allowed stand-alone shops and establishments dealing in non-essential services to open. These establishments, however, will be regulated by local authorities (municipal corporations and police) to ensure that no more than five shops (excluding the establishments dealing in essential commodities) in a lane are open at a time.The state government has, however, not allowed private and government offices to open in MMR, Pune, Pimpri-Chichwad and Malegaon. The government offices in these cities will operate with 5% workforce. The state government has also allowed construction activities in these cities to resume. “They will, however, have to ensure that their workforce is available in-situ. The Centre had allowed construction activities after completion of the first lockdown on April 14, however, we had banned those for the past two weeks,” said Bhushan Gagarani, principal secretary, Maharashtra government. “The change in the notification is to ensure the resumption of economic activities, which had come to a standstill, affecting the state’s economy badly. We will ensure that lockdown is strictly followed in the containment zones. By allowing these activities, we also want to retain the migrant workers who have been insisting on going back to their homelands,” said a senior state government official. An official from the excise department said that the state was losing revenue of around ₹68 crore a day earned from excise duty and sales tax on liquor. “Secondly, by imposing the ban only in certain areas, there was fear of smuggling of liquor from the areas it is allowed,” said the officer.Containment zones will be demarcated by the district and municipal corporation authorities. “The boundaries are defined by taking into account the various factors including mapping and geographical dispersion of cases and contacts and perimeter. The zone may vary from a building, colony, ward, mohallas to town and cluster of villages,” the notification stated.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray held a video conference with district collectors and divisional commissioners on the eve of the commencement of the third phase of the lockdown and relaxations given for commercial and industrial activities. “District authorities have been directed on the strict implementation of the lockdown, especially in the containment zones. With relaxations extended in the third phase, the containment in the affected areas has become very important. The district collectors were directed to implement it strictly,” said an official from the government.In the past 24 hours, the state has carried out 9,047 coronavirus tests and 678 people have tested positive, which is 7.49% of the total people tested. The number of tests state touched 1,70,139 on Sunday. 1,56,078 of them were negative. 1,81,382 people are currently under home quarantine, while 13,158 are under institutional quarantine. 11,048 teams of health workers have screened 51.05 lakh people for suspected infection after having come in contact with patients. 2,115 patients have fully recovered from various hospitals after testing positive in the past six weeks. The state government has stated that its testing rate is 1,237 per million against the national rate of just 803.E-commerce deliveries, however, will continue to be under restrictions of dealing in essential commodities. In green and orange zones, all e-commerce activities are allowed, clarified state government officials. Salons, spas, barber shops, taxis and autorickshaws will not be allowed in red zones. The state government has also clarified that it has no intention of plying any train from Mumbai or Pune in the near future for stranded migrant labourers. “As of now, there will be no trains originating from Mumbai and Pune for migrant workers. We have run four trains, three to Uttar Pradesh and one to Madhya Pradesh for stranded migrant workers. There are no plans to run trains from Mumbai and Pune, looking at the severity of the infection in these cities,” Gagarani said.Of the total Covid-19 cases in the state, 89.19% (10,968 of 12,296) and 85.6% of the deaths (446 of 521) are from the MMR, Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad as on Saturday. Malegaon municipal corporation area has been added as a hotspot with 219 cases and 12 deaths reported till Saturday.Meanwhile, CM Uddhav Thackeray has requested the railway ministry to waive off the fare from migrant workers who are travelling in special trains being arranged from Maharashtra. He said the workers are not in a position to bear the cost . He also has directed district collectors to keep the lists of the migrants who want to return to their respective states ready, so a to avoid last minute hassles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maha-govt-allows-shops-selling-non-essentials-liquor-to-open/story-0OLlAkhawHx5R7s0EWjvgL.html
03-05-2020||Delhi||After Azadpur mandi, Okhla market too to stay open 24x7 from May 4||The agricultural produce market in south-east Delhi’s Okhla will open all hours of the day throughout the week from May 4, as the lockdown extension comes into force, senior government officials said Sunday.“The decision was taken so that the supply chain of fruits and vegetables in the city is not disrupted, and retain prices do not increase at any cost. The market was sanitised today (Sunday) for round-the-clock operations. The government will deploy sanitation workers and an adequate number of civil defence volunteers to ensure social distancing,” a senior government official said.The Okhla wholesale market largely caters to retail the populace of south and south-east Delhi.Previously, when the lockdown was extended till May 3, the Delhi government had made the Azadpur market operational round the clock. However, traders in Azadpur raised concerns after 15 of them tested Covid-19 positive and one of them died in April. More than 100 persons have so far been quarantined following contact tracing.At the Okhla market, 500 individuals — from traders to accountants and labourers — were screened and at least 25 of them, who exhibited symptoms, were tested. Their reports are awaited, said Adil Khan, chairperson of the agriculture produce market committee (APMC).Azadpur is Delhi’s lifeline for fruits and vegetables. It receives supplies from around 3,300 trucks every day, on an average, and accounts for 80% of the total supply in the city. The markers at Ghazipur and Okhla, which receive supplies from around 350 trucks and 200 trucks per day, respectively, said officials of the APMC.Government officials said that they are yet to take a call on the round-the-clock operation of Ghazipur market, which was in the news last week due to violation of lockdown norms by a crowd.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/after-azadpur-mandi-okhla-market-too-to-stay-open-24x7-from-may-4/story-80m85qW2PZpp8fgnAMrzyI.html

Gurugram deputy commissioner Amit Khatri said, “All the business establishments will have to follow social distancing norms strictly to prevent the spread of Covid-19.The directions from the government mean that majority of businesses and industrial units in Gurugram would be allowed to resume operation with limited staff . These industries and shops should be outside the containment zone and located in IMT Manesar, industrial area in Udyog Vihar, Industrial Development Centre, rural areas and municipal areas.As per the direction issued by Haryana government, the business establishments will also have to give an undertaking that they will comply with standard operating procedure issued by the Union ministry of home affairs (MHA).VS Kundu, additional chief secretary, Haryana, and nodal authority of Gurugram for Covid-19 preparations, said, “Borders will remain sealed until situation shows positive signs. Industries are being opened slowly for betterment of workers and to revive economic activities in larger interest of the people. The government will keep assessing the day-to-day development with regards to Covid-19 cases and actions will be taken accordingly.”The district police, meanwhile, said that only interdistrict borders will witness relaxation, but the situation with the Delhi borders will remain the same. The employees from Delhi and Gurugram will not be allowed to cross the borders. “Only those with fresh permissions from district administration will be allowed to cross the border. Anyone else who has some personal emergency or medical emergency will be exempted, rest the situation remains the same,” said Muhammad Akil, police commissioner, Gurugram.Akil said the lockdown curfew during the day (between 7am and 7pm) will witness relaxation, but nights will remain the same.Passes to the employees shall be granted on weekly basis with fixed validity from May 4 to May 10 and from May 11 to May 17, the officials said.The applicants will also have to provide details of their ancillary units to seek support from state in reinstating their supply chains, the order said.Triangular marked passes shall be issued for essential goods industries and their employees in the containment zones.

The administration on social media issued an advisory that stated that only a limited number of passes were being approved daily.“No essential supplier will be stopped and neither will companies who are handling IT services involved in Covid-19 work,” Khatri added, adding that everyone will need to have their documents verified.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ggm-can-open-for-business-today-with-strict-social-distancing-norms/story-MfcHYW42mWdraWbQUiesIL.html
03-05-2020||Gurugram||City reports six new cases, focus fully on contact tracing||The district health team on Sunday confirmed six new cases of the Coronavirus disease (Covid-19), including a man who committed suicide last week after his wife tested positive for coronavirus earlier this week. Other positive cases have been reported from Sector 80, Ardee City Sector-52, Basai Enclave and Islampur village, taking the total tally of persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 to 73, of which 44 have been discharged and 29 are undergoing treatment. “The man who committed suicide last week has been confirmed Covid-19 positive. His wife was first confirmed Covid-19 positive on April 29. Next day, we took samples from the body to investigate how the lady contracted the virus. Since, the deceased is confirmed positive, we will now be tracing his history too,” chief medical officer Dr Jaswant Singh Punia said. On April 29, a 54-year-old man died when he allegedly hanged himself from a ceiling fan at his house in Sector 12 hours after he was informed that his wife was Covid positive. Around a week ago, the woman was taken to a hospital after she complained of distress in her stomach. She was later referred to another hospital in Sector 9 where she was tested for Covid-19.On Sunday, an autopsy was conducted and the body was handed over to his family. Civil Hospital forensic expert Dr Deepak Mathur said, “Once we were informed that the deceased tested positive for the coronavirus, we took all the necessary precautions and did an autopsy. The body was sterilized after it arrived at the mortuary. We wore full body PPE suits, including gloves and masks, during the examination.” A man who was a driver with Delhi Police, resident of Basai Enclave, also tested positive for Covid-19, Dr Punia said, adding, “We collected his sample after we were informed that the man was in contact with three Covid-19 positive patient in Delhi.” Meanwhile, a resident of Ardee City in Sector 52, contracted Covid-19 after visiting hospitals in the city to get treated for haemorrhoids. A resident of Islampur village, who worked in a mess at the Air Force Station in Rajiv Chowk has also been tested coronavirus positive. “We are still investigating the source of infection in a few of these cases,” Dr Punia said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/city-reports-six-new-cases-focus-fully-on-contact-tracing/story-kRhyrh1fEU5e1LKscrcoUJ.html
03-05-2020||City||Faridabad reports highest spike in Covid-19 cases in a day, total tally reaches 73||Gurugram: Ten people, including three health care workers, were found positive for the Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in Faridabad on Sunday, taking the tally of positive cases to 73 in the district. This is the highest number of Covid-19 cases reported in the past 24 hours in the district, health officials said, adding that 11 areas have been declared containment zones.In a containment zone, the health team covers a radius of 3-km from the epicentre of the infection and conducts screening, sampling, and testing of suspected cases.Yashpal Yadav, deputy commissioner, Faridabad, said that the new cases included two male nurses and a 42-year-old auxiliary nurse midwife, commonly known as ANM, working at a community health centre (CHC) at Kheri Kalan village. Besides, there are three patients, already under treatment for other ailments at Faridabad’s ESIC Medical College and Hospital, the officials said. Among the patients is a woman who had delivered a child a couple of days ago. “The others who are found infected with the deadly virus include a 24-year-old woman residing in Mujesar area of Faridabad and relatives of a pharmacist who had tested positive last month,” Yadav said.The deputy commissioner further said, “We had sent the samples of 3,497 people, of which 73 have tested positive and the results of 158 are awaited. As many as 30 people are currently hospitalised.” The infected people have been admitted to the ESIC hospital, the officials said, adding that at least 4,351 people are currently under home quarantine in the district.According to the officials, the police personnel are distributing face masks to those who are seen moving without them in Faridabad.Faridabad had sealed its borders with Delhi last month, prohibiting the entry of all commuters, including essential workers, until May 17.PALWAL REPORTS TWO MORE CASESOn Sunday, two more Covid-19 positive cases were reported in Palwal where no such cases had been reported since April 19, said Dr Brahmdeep Sindhu, chief medical officer, Palwal Civil Hospital.A Haryana policeman posted on the Nuh-Palwal border and a Palwal resident working in Faridabad were tested positive. This takes the district’s tally of positive cases to 36, of which 32 have already been discharged from the hospital.Sindhu said they hold three meetings in a day to discuss the next plan of action and to check the progress of cases. “We need to discuss the ongoing preparation and check the data compiled by the people who return from the field in the evening. We all are connected through WhatsApp group and also keep a check on all the movements of the doctors and staff members,” he said.As many as 2,172 people are under home quarantine, the officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/faridabad-reports-highest-spike-in-covid-19-cases-in-a-day-total-tally-reaches-73/story-wHt2646ZatZR0FL3O1pbUP.html
03-05-2020||Gurugram||Liquor shops to remain closed till further orders||Liquor shops in the city will remain closed until further orders as district excise and taxation department has not received any fresh directive from the government in this regard, officials said.With Gurugram opening industries and businesses from Monday, it was expected that liquor shops would be opening in the city but people were disappointed after they heard that liquor shops in Gurugram will not be opened.H C Dahiya, deputy excise and taxation commissioner (west), said that they have not received any orders yet to reopen the liquor vends in the district. However, they have received more than 100 calls on Sunday after chief minister had announced that shops will reopen from Monday. “We are likely to open the liquor vends in the coming week. However, we have not decided on a date yet as we haven’t received any orders from the state,” he said.The Haryana government on March 26 had decided to temporarily shut down all the liquor vends across the state till further orders as part of its preventive measures to curb the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak, said officials.The decision was taken after the deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala, who also holds the portfolios of excise and taxation, held a video conference with all the deputy excise and taxation commissioners (DETCs) of the state and ordered them to get the vends shut by the midnight of March 26.249 liquor vends in Gurugram had remained open even as malls and other non-essential stores were shut to contain the spread of coronavirus in the first week of March, said the officials.The officials said outlets across the state selling both countrymade and Indian made foreign liquor (IMFL) were shut. A major chunk of state’s revenue comes in the form of excise duty, which was ₹6,600 crore last year.All liquor godowns in the city are also shut, the officials said, adding that there has been a major dip in the sale of liquor in the last two months which is more than ₹one crore.The police had recovered more than 10,000 cases of IMFL liquor from Sohna, Pataudi and the city area in the last two months which were being smuggled in trucks with vegetables, said the police.“The closure order was issued keeping in mind the safety of public health and to ensure social distancing. Though we did not receive any complaints, we want to take precautionary measures in the wake of coronavirus,” Chautala said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/liquor-shops-to-remain-closed-till-further-orders/story-O82NI4SfAdDiuCUmNNofwM.html
03-05-2020||Gurugram||28-day no-Covid observation period must to unseal containment zones||Containment zones in the district will be denotified only if no new case of Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) is reported in the said area after the 28th day since the last case tests negative. Earlier, an area could be unsealed if no case was reported for 14 days.In a statement released by the district administration on Sunday, chief medical officer Dr Jaswant Singh Punia said that the containment operation in a zone will be considered complete when the report of the last positive case is negative for 28 days. “If a new case emerges in this duration, the containment zone will not be opened and status quo will be maintained,” he said. A 3-km zone around the place where a Coronavirus case is found will be declared a hot spot and turned into a containment zone. No movement of people, even to but essentials (milk, vegetables and medicines), is not allowed. Hospitals and healthcare centres in containment zones remain open, but can only be accessed in case of medical emergencies. For contact tracing, the health department conducts a door-to-door survey and sample testing to detect Covid-19 infections and the area is regularly disinfected.As of now, the district administration has 24 containment zones, created on recommendations of the Containment Zone Committee and District Disaster Management Committee. In Gurugram block, the containment zones are – Fazilpur in Jharsa village, Jharsa village, Sector 39, Sector 47, Devi Lal Colony, Sun City Sector 54, Sarhaul Village, Tyagiwara Badshahpur, Meghdoot Apartment Sector 10 A, and Om Nagar.Sohna block has the following containment zones: Gehlot Vihar, Javed Colony, Pahar Colony, Nut Colony, ITI Colony, Mohalla Bhood Para, Mohalla Thakurwara, Tripat Colony, Shiv Kund, Bhagat Wada, and Raipur village.

03-05-2020||Gurugram||Permission to domestic helps by RWAs remains under confusion, contention||Though the announcement of 15-day lockdown extension with relaxations, on Friday, was followed by issuance of a set of guidelines by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), the relieved, but confused, residents of Gurugram found themselves asking key questions—can house helps come and should they? To answer this question inclusively, many RWAs have started taking online polls of members and send the feedback to the district administration so an informed decision can be taken. Deputy commissioner Amit Khatri has said, “An advisory in this regard will be issued soon.”On Saturday evening, after reports surfaced that the decision to allow entry of domestic help rests with respective RWAs, the residents’ body of DLF 2 did a four-hour-long online poll asking residents to give their views on the matter. In the poll, 68% of residents voted against allowing entry of domestic helps.“We decided to do a poll to give our views to the district administration regarding the matter so they can make a decision by factoring in the views of a larger group of people. Once the polling was finished, we compiled a report and forwarded it to the district administration. We will oblige with whatever order they issue on the matter,” DLF 2 RWA president Gaurav Wahi said, adding that the poll took place between 6 pm-10 pm on Telegram app on Sunday. A total of 185 people voted; DLF 2 has about 4,500 residents.As per the new guidelines, domestic helps will be allowed in all areas that are not containment zones. Gurugram district has 24 containment zones with 11 in Sohna, 10 in Gurugram and three in Pataudi.As most Gurugram colonies are serviced by individuals living in nearby slums, commuting with continued ban on public transportation is not a hindrance. However, what now worries residents is the possibility of contracting the viral virus from their helps who live in high-density areas. Vice versa, the help stand the possibility of contracting the virus at work and then taking it back to these areas. Some slum clusters, such as Jharsa village, mix-income high-congestion area of Sector 39 and nearby Islampur village, have reported 13 cases over the past fortnight. Even as the contract tracing exercise is on, officials said they expect more cases to emerge as many medical health care workers live here. All the 13 cases, so far, have been of health care workers contracting Covid-19, the disease caused by the vital coronavirus.In Princeton Estate, DLF 5, after receiving several queries from residents regarding the movement of domestic helps, the RWA informed that status quo would be maintained until any specific direction is issued by the state government or the district administration.“On Friday, we had issued a circular to all residents informing that restrictions within the condominium, including ban on entry of domestic help from outside, will remain until the district administration issues an order stating otherwise,” Arati Pandya, joint secretary, Princeton Estate Condominium Association said, adding that they plan to meet Monday evening (today) to discuss this matter and take a call on the steps to be taken. Nilesh Tandon, president of Fresco RWA, Nirvana Country, also said the RWA is waiting for clarity from the state government and are hoping that the onus of allowing domestic help would not fall on the RWAs.“We are hoping that the district administration or state government issues an advisory clarifying their stance on the entry of domestic help into residential areas as we too are confused. We hope they do not put the onus on RWAs, as is the case in Delhi, because it will put us all in a Catch22-like situation,” said Tandon.“Union ministry of home affairs (MHA) direction makes it very clear that people, including domestic help, can move between 7 am-7 pm. People would not need a pass to move around during this 12-hour period. They would have to strictly observe precautions, such as wearing masks and maintain a minimum physical distance (1 metre from people),” additional chief secretary and nodal officer for Covid-19 VS Kundu said.With the need for caution to be practiced by individuals at the centre of the district’s fight against Covid, it must be remembered that on April 10, the district administration had made wearing of a mask in public places compulsory under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code. Public urination and spitting are also punishable with an on-spot fine of ₹1,000, as ordered by the MCG.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/permission-to-domestic-helps-by-rwas-remains-under-confusion-contention/story-G62VVpBnqNVitwWjzfeNKN.html
03-05-2020||Gurugram||Office spaces, work culture in city to see paradigm shift in post-pandemic era||A large majority of corporate executives, IT workers and those in the service sector might still have few more weeks to return to their offices, but company leaders in the city have already started to plan and anticipate the changes they will have to incorporate when people return to their jobs in the post-lockdown pandemic-affected world. Architects, HR personnel and those involved in running and managing these offices agree that there is going to be a radical shift in how these spaces look and operate in the time to come.In the last two decades, Gurugram has emerged as an IT and ITes hub and is home to more than 300 Fortune 500 companies based in India.Experts engaged in planning and designing offices suggest that in the long run, hands-free features and functionalities will be the order of the day, like mobile operated light controls, automatic doors and copper-coated metal/plastic handles (as several research papers mention that bacteria stays on copper only for four hours, as opposed to 24 hours on stainless steel).“I am not suggesting we will go back to cubicles like the 1950s but I do think the density in offices will change. We will move away from the open-plan, the height of workstation separators will increase, there will be more natural ventilation along with less use of upholstery like carpets and chairs,” says Mudita Dhankhar, an architect and associate director, sales and projects at Garage Society, a co-working space provider.In the shorter run, experts envisage an increased focus on disinfecting premises, cleaning doors, tables and maintaining social distancing. According to them, the use of elevators will be controlled with only three or four people allowed to enter, not including a member of staff operating it.Human resource leaders from different companies say that caution would be the keyword when work resumes—the entire workforce will not be called in at once when the lockdown ends. Discussions would be held within firms and strategies would be changed to meet the challenges of the post-pandemic world, they add.Shilpa Narang Jerath, director of human resources, Oppo India, says that only those employees whose jobs absolutely cannot be managed from home will be asked to get back to work if they can. “If the employee says that they don’t think it is safe, we will not ask them to come. We are people first, so he or she will get to choose if they want to come back to the office then. But until the situation is completely safe we will keep checking and assessing the situation,” she adds.HR personnel also predict that there would be significant changes in how workers travel, socialise in canteens and cafes, and hold discussions in meeting rooms.“Workers might not be able to huddle together and chat. Minimum distance has to be maintained for their own good and of others. Meeting rooms will have fewer participants. For example, if it is a 12-seater room, then it will be reduced to a five-seater one. When the lockdown is lifted, everyone will not be able to rush to their respective offices at the same time. Offices are also going to open up in a graded manner—initially, companies are going to operate with 20% or 50% of the staff,” Pravin Kutty, vice president and head of HR, Snapdeal, says.In IT companies, where the usage of workstations and dedicated computers is critical, companies are planning to ask workers to come in on alternate days, introduce staggered timings and ask employees to sit at alternate desks. “We will focus on fewer meetings in closed spaces, eating food at work stations will be allowed, coffee breaks can be taken in open spaces and other SoPS for sanitisation and disinfection will be a priority,” Mamta Yadav, practise leaders, talent acquisition, IRIS Corporate, an HR systems company, says.Workers could also be asked to come on alternate days, say HR leaders. Professionals engaged in designing corporate office spaces further opine that going forward, offices will tend to become more flexible and agile from a space-planning aspect to accommodate any change in terms of a safe environment and safe distancing. “While there will be higher value around spaces where people can come together, the attention towards securing those spaces in terms of minimising touchpoints, materiality, establishing distance norms and maintaining overall hygiene will be equally critical,” Titir Dey, design director, Space Matrix, says.For companies located in Delhi-NCR, managements are considering the plausibility of access to public transport for employees post the lockdown. Employees commute across the region to reach their offices. With the government still not clear on when Metros, buses and cab services will resume operations, companies are keeping the work-from-home option open for employees.“Once the lockdown is lifted, we think that public transport might still be restricted and/or risky. Therefore, we are likely to make work-from-home an option for all employees until the situation is completely back to normal,” Sudhir Kamath, CEO and co-founder, 9Stacks, a tech-based gaming company, says.Businesses that engage in manual work in the city are taking into account the efficiency of washing hands periodically to beat the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). They are also considering adding washrooms with bath facilities to ensure employees shower before they start working. “Earlier, we had a dry locker facility, now we are working on a wet locker facility wherein as soon as the employee enters the premises, they can take a shower—we have made this mandatory. Also, the employees who do not handle food will be given a separate locker room to change in a different area,” Chef Karan Talwar, managing director of Kitchen Kraft Luxury Catering, says.He adds that the company is also following standard procedure wherein all employees wash their hands every two hours.The work-from-home phenomenon, which was thrust upon companies, has been providing better than expected results, particularly for IT firms. Companies are likely to stick to this as they reduce spending on expensive real estate and maintenance. “The post-pandemic world will see a new work culture evolve, leading to firms reducing their office space footprint and also help workers spend less time on commuting. The cost of air-conditioning and running glass and chrome offices is significantly high,” Sanjay Sharma, a real estate consultant based in the city, says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/office-spaces-work-culture-in-city-to-see-paradigm-shift-in-post-pandemic-era/story-EHZ3lgGWTYFcVl7zmXYoOO.html
03-05-2020||Noida||Surveillance, more beds, contact tracing: Gzb readies for a world with Covid||After the relaxed lockdown guidelines were announced on Sunday, state officials issued strict directions with regard to containment zones/hot spots and told the health and administration officials to beef up surveillance activities. Officials added that for better contact tracing every person in every household will have to download the Aryoga Setu app and training would be given to residents, if needed. Restrictions on movement remain if the person is over 65 years of age, officials said. The officials estimate that stricter measures would be needed once the relaxations comes into play from Monday. Accordingly, the state is also preparing to handle more cases as people start stepping out for work. The UP chief minister recently directed all districts to increase the capacity of Covid and quarantine facilities. He also told districts to make arrangement of another 15,000-20,000 quarantine beds and 52,000 beds in the Covid L1, L2 and L3 hospitals. “We have asked two private hospitals (in Ghaziabad) to reserve a part of their wards for Covid-19 beds and hand it over to us or they start functioning as Covid hospitals and charge patients accordingly. At present, the Covid treatment in government facilities is free of cost. There are certain patients who want admission in private hospitals so we are making arrangements,” the CMO said.The state has 155 L1 category hospitals, 69 L2 and 19 L3 category dedicated Covid hospitals to deal with positive cases.“The CM has directed that we need to identify bigger facilities where 1,000-1,500 beds can be accommodated. At present, we have a total of about 1,400 quarantine beds. We are also trying to add 200 more beds for isolation/Covid against about 695 available at present,” CMO added.PEDAL ON CONTACT TRACING “There has to be contact tracing of every Covid-19 patient, mapping of the case is mandatory and complete compliance is a must. The officials will also have to check the geographical spread of the cases and see where the contacts of the positive patients have spread to,” UP additional chief secretary (home) Awanish Awasthi said.“As per the fresh guidelines, a containment zone will be a 1km radius from epicentre in urban and rural areas, if there are more than one cases. For just one case, containment zone will be 400 metres. So, these areas will range from minimum of 400 metres to 1km. This is for better management of hot spots. Further, every person in every household will have to download the Aryoga Setu app. The officials will check and will also train residents if needed,” Awasthi added.The officials have also asked for beefing up of door-to-door surveillance in hot spots. They added that if anyone is found suffering from influenza like illness (ILI), flu or severe acute respiratory infection (SARI), the medical teams will conduct tests and take appropriate medical action.According to officials, the number of Covid-19 active cases in UP stood at 1,838 till Sunday evening while 698 other persons were discharged and 43 deaths taken place so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/surveillance-more-beds-contact-tracing-gzb-readies-for-a-world-with-covid/story-oNofnHGh4fcHSLQl2fAasK.html
03-05-2020||City||Yeida to build and repair roads to engage 500 stranded migrants||The Yamuna Expressway industrial development authority(Yeida) on Sunday said that it has decided to complete under-construction roads and finish the remaining construction work in order to employ at least 500 migrant labourers, who have been rendered jobless due to the nationwide lockdown.The authority has decided to finish stuck projects so that the labourers do not remain jobless and can keep earning their livelihood. After the government of India extended the nationwide lockdown till May 17, around 500 migrant labourers were staring at uncertainty as most of them did not want to go back to their respective home towns. Two more weeks of joblessness would have costed them dearly, said officials. “We have decided to finish our incomplete projects, including the construction of two roads, repair work, and other developmental works so that we can give these migrant workers a source of engagement. We will start work from Monday onwards,” said Arun Vir Singh, CEO, Yeida.The Yeida said that earlier in March, they had already processed the tendering process for two roads — one connects Greater Noida with Jewar and some patches on the service lane that runs parallel to the Yamuna Expressway. But they could not start the work after the nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of Covid 19 was put in place on March 25, 2020. The Yeida had allocated a budget of around ₹60 crore for these two roads.However, the Yeida wants to start work now after the ministry of home affairs relaxed lockdown conditions. The Yeida will also finish small works of roads, drains, and parks in sectors 18 and 20, which are the new developing urban areas. However, the Yeida will ensure that the construction work happens strictly in compliance with social distancing norms. Senior officials from the civil department and the administration will monitor these projects so that social distancing is followed. “Top officials will keep a watch to ensure that labourers follow social distancing to avoid the spread of Covid-19 infection,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/yeida-to-build-and-repair-roads-to-engage-500-stranded-migrants/story-0hIoc73ekUQfzh4M1JUqbN.html
03-05-2020||City||Ghaziabad doctor puts up notice barring entry of cops to his clinic||Ghaziabad: A doctor at the Raj Nagar District Centre on Sunday put up a board at his clinic where he disallowed free consultation to police persons after a member of his staff was allegedly harassed by cops during a checking operation in Raj Nagar.“The cops seized the motorcycle of my laundry person while he was going home after taking clothes from the clinic. He told me that police officers abused him and also demanded money. It was after this that I put up a notice at my clinic where I denied entry to policemen who come to my clinic. Usually I give free consultation and even free treatment to defence personnel and policemen but after this incident I will abstain from attending to policemen,” said Dr BP Tyagi.However, police officers from the Kavi Nagar police station denied allegations of use of abusive words or any demand of money made by the policemen on duty.“The staff member was riding a two-wheeler with a pillion rider along with a bundle of clothes. This was a violation of lockdown norms. He was stopped during checking and he could not produce documents of the vehicle. The vehicle was seized but it was later released after the staff member arrived with documents. Later, there were allegations that our personnel demanded money and harassed the man.

03-05-2020||Noida||Noida police arrest 3 history-sheeters after encounter||Two criminals, wanted in at least a dozen of robbery cases and those related to the Arms Act in the district, were arrested by the Gautam Buddh Nagar police, after an encounter in Maicha under the Dadri police station on Saturday late evening. The police have also arrested another gang member involved in looting truck drivers at the Peripheral Road. The other had managed to escape to Dayanagar village under Jarcha police station on Sunday.GB Nagar commissioner of police (CP) Alok Singh said that despite drastic fall in crime rate in the district in the recent past, the police have been conducting continuous raids to nab history-sheeters. “Acting on a tip-off, the police team intercepted four motorcycle-borne criminals near the forest area of Maicha peripheral underpass. When the criminals started indiscriminate firing on the police, they had no option than to fire back. As a result, two of them suffered minor bullet injuries and were nabbed by the police team. Two countrymade pistols and live cartridges were recovered. One of the other two criminals, who had managed to escape, was also arrested with one .32-bore pistol and live bullets,” he said.The arrested criminals have been identified as Ravinder Singh alias Rambhu, Sahil, who is known by his first name, and Jayveer Gujjar. While Ravinder and Sahil have been admitted to the district hospital by the police, Jayveer has been forwarded for judicial custody. “Ravinder and Sahil have been named accused in more than one dozen cases related to the Arms Act, attempt to murder, robbery and loot, lodged at different police stations of the district. Jayveer, too, is wanted in at least four cases of the same nature. Cash and mobile phones, looted by them, have also been recovered from their possession,” the official sources said.According to the police, on the night of March 29, these criminals had snatched three mobile phones from a truck driver and his helper on the expressway. The truck driver Lokendra Singh said that he was going to Ghaziabad with some essential commodities when the truck broke down a few kilometres from the toll plaza. “I had parked the truck on the roadside when three criminals reached the spot and snatched my three mobile phones. They also smashed the windshield of the truck, when I resisted,” he said. The Dadri police have registered a case of robbery under Section 392 of the Indian Penal Code(IPC).The police also recovered a stolen motorcycle from the suspects’ possession. The motorcycle owner, Khadak Singh, a resident of Rampur village, told the police that he had parked the motorcycle outside his house on May 1, when the suspects stole it and used it in committing crimes.“We have recovered six stolen mobile phones, two countrymade guns, two live cartridges, and ₹6,600 in cash from their possession. The suspects were already wanted in cases of theft and robbery. They were produced in court and sent to judicial custody,” said the DCP Greater Noida Rajesh Kumar Singh. The police have launched a search for the absconding criminals.The police chief said that with limited options to move around during the ongoing lockdown due to the Covid-19 outbreak, it is a good time for the Noida police to nab the most-wanted criminals and history-sheeters of the district. “Our boys are already on their heels. They are either enforcing the lockdown or conducting frequent raids to nab the criminals. We don’t want to give them any chance to give us a slip,” he said.Singh also said that the police have also been keeping a close eye on the activities and physical locations of the criminals, who had recently been released on parole from Kasna district jail, as per the Covid-19 guidelines. “During this drive, it was found that out of 165 accused, who were released on parole, 15 were not present at their locations provided. Out of 98 accused named in different cases of loot and robbery in the district, 23 were found absent from their residential addresses provided to the jail and police authorities. Of these 23 accused,10 are from Noida zone, while nine and four are from central Noida and Greater Noida respectively. We are trying our best to send these absentee accused behind the bars again,” Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-police-arrest-3-history-sheeters-after-encounter/story-Ezs9K6cWbb8nAs83dkgHzJ.html

The seven patients included an 11-year-old girl and the domestic help of the family. No new case has come up from both the trails as of late, officials said.At Ceasefire, the managing director had returned from the UK on March 1, while another employee had returned from abroad on March 7. They had also hosted a visiting auditor from London for three days in the third week of March. All the three persons jumped their quarantine period and were attending office, which allegedly led to the spread of Sars-Cov-2 among other the employees and then to the employees’ family members.The MD has also been discharged now, from the Super Speciality Hospital where he was recuperating.The last patient from the Ceasefire trail was discharged on May 1 after spending around 36 days in the hospital.

The 42 persons include employees, their family members and domestic helpers.The health officials said they are happy that all the patients from the two important trails of COVID-19 have been discharged. “We are relieved that all the 42 patients from the Ceasefire trail and seven from the residential society of Greater Noida West are discharged. These two were the first two clusters which were identified in the district. Over 150 employees of the company were put on surveillance and we identified 42 persons positive from the trail that had direct or indirect contact with the company,” said a senior health official, who is leading the contact tracing of COVID-19 patients and suspected patients.Officials said that over 1,000 people were put under surveillance, who come in direct or indirect contact with the Ceasefire employees.The Expressway police had lodged an FIR against Ceasefire under Section 45 (Punishment of offences committed within India), 188 (Disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and 270 (Malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) of the Indian Penal Code.

03-05-2020||City||Nearly 1,200 stranded students leave GB Nagar for their native places in UP||Noida: Nearly 1,200 students, stranded in Gautam Budh Nagar due to the Covid-19 lockdown, on Sunday left for their hometowns in 45 different districts of Uttar Pradesh aboard 51 state-run buses arranged by the district administration.“A total of 1,184 students are being sent back to their native places in 51 buses,” said MN Upadhyay, additional district magistrate (finance), who is the nodal officer.However, for now only UP students are being evacuated, officials said, adding that the arrangements for students of other states will be done eventually.The UP government had last week ordered the district administrations to arrange transport for stranded students, after which an online link was shared by the district administration on May 1 with a form for the students to fill in the requisite details and apply for the permission and facilities to go back home in UP and other states.“Every bus has been sanitized. The driver and cleaner tested, and two home guards are there in each bus. All necessary precautions of social distancing are being maintained. Students have been given masks, food packets and water bottles,” said Upadhyay.The students were picked up from seven points in the district -- Botanical Garden metro station, City Centre metro station, Gaur City/Kisan Chowk, Electronic City metro station, Sector 51 Metro station, Advant Crossing in Sector 142 and Ghanta Ghar in Surajpur. All the students were taken to India Expo Mart in Knowledge Park area of Greater Noida, from where the buses left for the different parts of UP. “All respective district administrations have been provided with the list of students. Also, the students have been asked to stay in quarantine for 14 days when they reach home,” said Upadhyay.The move comes as a relief for the students who had been stranded here for almost two months now.“I am from Maharajganj. I had been staying with my elder brother in Noida Sector 30. He is a doctor. Every day when he came back home, I feared that I might contract the Coronavirus. As I am leaving Noida, my family would be very happy now,” said Dharam Raj Yadav, a final year engineering student of a private college in Greater Noida.All educational institutions in the district had been closed even before the national lockdown was announced on March 24.“The hostels were shutting, so I moved to a friend’s paying guest accommodation in Sector 15. Finally, I am going home. My parents had been worried for the past two months,” said Renu Singh, a final year MBA student who comes from Varanasi.The students received mails with the travel information, after which they reached respective pick-up points. However, the situation did not turn out well for everyone.“I got to know about the link today. I first went to the nearest police station who directed me to the DM office. When I went there, I was told that the registration had closed. So, I have missed my chance to go back home, and no one knows when the opportunity will come back again,” said Deepak, a student living in Sector 53 who is a native of Deoria district.The officials said that the link would re-open in a couple of days, but they refused to give the exact date.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/nearly-1-200-stranded-students-leave-gb-nagar-for-their-native-places-in-up/story-WM4xN9a3H2cBtd5wxWFiiM.html

Kumar has worked on 22 locomotive breakdowns since the starting of the lockdown from March 21. Locomotive or rail engines are important as railway uses its freight and parcel services for transportation of goods amid lockdown.“There is no public transport system available from the village I stay at since the starting of the lockdown. Private cars are very minimal and are not available,” said Babloo Kumar.Kumar has been working with the Central Railway in the locomotive maintenance department since 2016. “Initially I thought it would be difficult to cover the distance by walking. However, the timely operation of parcel and goods trains is very necessary during the lockdown as they carry essential commodities. That is why I decided to walk,” said Kumar.Central Railway is scheduled to operate 310 parcel trains carrying essential commodities across states. The railways have operated 210 parcel trains since the beginning of the lockdown.“Kumar is one of the numerous people working behind the scenes. We give a big salute to all the railway warriors and thank them for their continuous and non-stop efforts that help in the operation of goods and parcel trains,” said Shivaji Sutar, chief public relation officer, Central Railway.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/unsung-corona-warrior-walks-8-km-daily-for-maintenance-of-rail-engines/story-GY4O2tUdMMHIgFZ8bKugAI.html

These migrant workers are now turning to social activists, police personnel, and civic officials for help.“We just came to know that we can go to our home but have no idea how.

Of these, works on 68 were completed and construction of 247 projects was in progress. However, 88 projects are affected due to the hotspot restrictions in the city. “Yes, it is true that projects have been affected by the coronavirus pandemic and we have lost a bit of time, but when the problem is over we shall resume construction,” deputy municipal commissioner (infrastructure) Sanjay Darade said.He further explained that currently, they are unable to move construction machinery from one place to another due to the coronavirus outbreak that has affected traffic movement in the city. “We have now lost precious time, but we will start work as soon as possible to finish the work,” he added.Out of the 88 affected projects, 52 projects were from the city, 10 projects from eastern suburbs and 26 from western suburbs. The civic body has deployed 1,511 labourers on these projects.Furthermore, availability of construction raw material including sand, steel and cement also needs to be factored in, added the official. The state and the civic body is handling the critical situation on a war footing.Coronavirus has affected the road construction projects from Jijamata Nagar Worli, Dharavi, Andheri, Kurla and Goregaon. Even after the lockdown is revoked on May 17, the civic work will take another 15 more days time for workers to come back.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/repairs-of-88-roads-come-to-a-standstill-amid-lockdown/story-Mr42Yrfa0VAKFae2BjXTsN.html

03-05-2020||Mumbai||First in Maharashtra: Pune medical college gets ICMR nod to start clinical trials for convalescent plasma therapy||BJ Medical College, Pune, has become the first medical institute in Maharashtra to receive an approval from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) to run clinical trials for the convalescent plasma therapy. The blood sample of the first donor has been sent for antibody titre to the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune.Convalescent plasma therapy involves injecting patients with plasma from the blood of recovered patients. In this process, the plasma with antibodies is transfused into an infected person to boost his immunity response to the novel coronavirus.To start a clinical trial, a medical institute has to undergo a four-stage approval process — permissions from the institute, ethics committee, drug controller and lastly ICMR. In Mumbai, Lilavati Hospital at Bandra tried to treat a Covid-19 patient through plasma therapy. However, they are yet to receive the final approval from ICMR.“BJ Medical College is the first medical institute to pass through all four stages of approvals. We will now run clinical trials that will help establish if plasma therapy is effective for the treatment of patients,” said Dr Sanjay Mukherjee, secretary, Medical Education and Drugs Department.ICMR, however, has made it clear that it does not recommend plasma therapies as treatment outside clinical trial settings. In the absence of a vaccine or a specific drug, plasma therapies have been tested globally, albeit in limited numbers, as a treatment for patients who show severe complications due to coronavirus.Dr Mukherjee explained that there is at present a belief among medical fraternity that antibodies developed among recovered patients may help neutralise the virus—Sars-CoV-2 that causes Covid-19. “The theory can be established by testing it (with approval) on patients through clinical trials,” he said.Murlidhar Tambe, Deputy Dean of BJ Medical College said that all the patients who will participate in the trial will be covered under insurance. Without disclosing much information, he said, “We have procured equipment to run the trial. But we are waiting for the final insurance reports of the patients to go ahead with the trial. We need cured people to come forward to donate their blood for the therapy”The college has collected blood from a male donor in his late 20s who has recovered from Covid-19 for over a month. The blood has been sent to NIV for extraction of the plasma. Once they get a green signal from the laboratory, they will transfuse it into a Covid-19 patient. As per sources, the first transfusion will be conducted on Monday. The Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) has already permitted the plasmapheresis (the process in which plasma is separated from the blood cells).Normally, before starting with the clinical trials, it is tested on animals. But as plasma therapy is already an established form of treatment in other diseases, initial testing on animals is not needed.“Patients will be invited to participate in randomised control trials with their approval. Once we can confirm that it is effective on humans with Covid-19, the therapy will be scientifically considered for the treatment of patients with novel coronavirus,” Mukherjee added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/first-in-maharashtra-pune-medical-college-gets-icmr-nod-to-start-clinical-trials-for-convalescent-plasma-therapy/story-O4zfqd195zzFBlxRiUyMzL.html
03-05-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra saw 9,000 more cases at the end of 2nd lockdown||Maharashtra saw around 9,000 more Covid-19 cases and 330 deaths during the second lockdown, according to data from the state health ministry. The state health department feels the situation would have been far worse without the lockdown.At the end of the first lockdown, on April 14, the cases in the state stood at 2,684, with 178 deaths. By the end of the three weeks of the lockdown on May 2, the cases are 12,296 with 521 deaths. In Mumbai, the case count was 1,756 with 112 deaths on April 14, which went up to 8,359, with 322 deaths on May 2.On May 3, 678 new cases were reported, taking the state tally to 12,974 and death toll touched 548. Mumbai recorded 441 new cases on Sunday taking tally to 8,800 with 343 deaths.Dr Pradip Awate, state disease surveillance officer, said, “The government has enforced the lockdown measures very well. The cases have increased, but we can’t ignore that we have controlled the doubling rate of corona cases from 2.5-3 days to 9 days. Without it, the situation could have been far worse and the numbers higher. The lockdown is helping us break the chain. We have also successfully managed to keep our mortality rate at 4.24%, better than the world’s 7.04%.”According to the state health department, among the 551 deaths, 368 (73 per cent) had comorbidities or other serious diseases. Till May 2, around 2,000 people have recovered. In the last one week, the state has witnessed a huge jump in the cured category. The administration has also been creating containment zones wherever cases are rising to check local transmission. The spike in the cases in the last few days has been sharp, with a rise of 1008 cases reported on Friday and an increase of 790 in the next 24 hours.The official, however, turned down the possibility of community transmission. “We can say the infection is being transmitted locally and not on community level. The cases are increasing in areas where people are not following social distancing norms seriously. I urge people to do that,” said Dr Awate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-saw-9-000-more-cases-at-the-end-of-2nd-lockdown/story-uTVqfNNGEFQvkywIMqMa2O.html

However, the trial will be conducted at BJ Medical College, Pune. Covid-19 is a new strain of coronavirus which doesn’t have any vaccination or specific medications. To find a solution, Haffkine Institute, last month submitted a proposal to conduct a clinical trial to use the anti-tuberculosis Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine, as a treatment. On Friday, they received a nod from the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI).“The vaccine helps to improve the immune system among people, so it is believed that it can be used as a treatment for patients with Covid. Preliminary research has shown that it has helped to neutralise the virus to some extent,” said Dr Sanjay Mukherjee, secretary, Medical Education and Drugs Department (MEDD).Around 35 people with moderate and severe infection will be part of the trial. Usha Padmanabhan who currently heads the Department of Cell Biology at Haffkine Institute will be in-charge of the trial. Dr Rajesh Deshmukh, managing director of the Haffkine Institute said, “Unlike other new drugs, it would be easier to treat patients as this vaccine is already available in markets.

03-05-2020||Mumbai||BMC asks private medical practitioners to issue fitness certificates to migrant workers||In order to avoid crowding at civic-run clinics and hospitals and ensure social distancing, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Sunday issued a circular allowing private clinics and nursing homes to issue fitness certificates to migrant labourers and those stranded in the city. Having a medical fitness certificate is one of the mandatory criteria required to be fulfilled for migrant labourers willing to go back to their hometowns amid nationwide lockdown. The move comes after a huge crowd of migrant workers was observed outside Bhabha Hospital among other civic hospitals and clinics on Sunday. The Mumbai Police had earlier started distributing forms to migrant labourers and those stranded in the city. However, several private clinics and nursing homes were reluctant to issue fitness certificates in the absence of clarity or guidelines from the BMC for the same.The civic body on Sunday issued a circular prescribing a format in which all civic-run and private medical professionals are expected to issue a medical fitness certificate. The circular reads, “All registered medical practitioners practising in Mumbai can issue such certificates after taking history and clinical examination of the persons wishing to travel that he/she does not have influenza-like symptoms.”The circular added, “For identification of persons please check any government identity card and keep hard/soft copy for record. Regular patients should be treated on priority.”After the Central government announced the evacuation plan for migrant workers, all state governments were asked to have a standard operating procedure for the allowing of travel. However, in Mumbai, the migrant labourers were facing issues as private practitioners were not issuing medical certificates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-asks-private-medical-practitioners-to-issue-fitness-certificates-to-migrant-workers/story-GWN58US0TaRAvY57bXp0AN.html

Central Railway (CR) informed that all safety precautions were carried out during the boarding process. Several more migrants have now gathered at the police station in Bhiwandi, as the Thane police update a new passenger list for the special outstation trains. “The train was scheduled at around 9pm from Bhiwandi, as per directions from the state government, after receiving bookings for over 1,000 passengers. However, the train was delayed by four hours from the originating station as passengers had to be thoroughly checked by the police, and were required to wear masks and maintain social distance,” said Shivaji Sutar, chief public relation officer, Central Railway, Mumbai.“Meals and water were provided by CR to the passengers throughout the journey. To maintain social distance, 50 passengers were accommodated in each coach, as opposed to the 70-plus passengers. The train was sanitised and passengers were directed to form a queue to board. A total of 1,104 passengers were permitted to travel in the train after their essential papers and fitness certificate were verified,” said Sutar.Migrants still stranded in Thane gathered outside the office of local corporator in Gokul Nagar area of Thane on Saturday, to get their fitness certification.“The queue of migrants has been noticed since yesterday evening. Over 250 migrants have approached us to get their fitness certificates. The list of people who have no health issues has been prepared by our volunteers from the area. The same list will later be handed over to the local police station,” said Krishna Patil, corporator, ward No 11, Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC).“The fitness certification is being conducted in coordination with the local police teams and with the help of doctors who are also residents of the same ward which consists of areas like, Gokul Nagar, Shrirang society, Vrundavan, Azad Nagar, Kolbad, and Kolshet in Thane,” said Patil.Thane police are now taking a detailed survey of labourers stranded in the city during the lockdown, who want to return to their hometowns. Police teams have already started taking their applications and within the next two days, they are going to complete the survey to make further arrangements.Suraj Kumar, 30, came to Mumbai from Gondia, Maharashtra, for the first time four months back. He got a job at a construction site in Bhiwandi but was let go in in March when the construction site closed. “After lockdown started I hardly had ₹300 with me. It was a really difficult time as for two to three days I didn’t have food. Later, I met a few people from my village and they helped me to get food. I desperately want to go home. Living in this city is expensive,” said Kumar. “We heard that the Gorakhpur train has taken 1,104 labourers and it increased our hopes. We have managed to collect money for the ticket and are waiting for the next announcement,” he added.Maloji Shinde, senior inspector, Narpoli police station, said, “Our team is collecting data of each labourer and taking their detailed applications so that we will get an idea of how many others are still waiting to leave.”Labourers who left the city on Saturday were happy and grateful to the officials. Kishan Kumar, one of the passengers who travelled on the Shramik Express, said, “We all were worried till the train started, but after that, we all are feeling so happy and just waiting to reach home. We didn’t have enough money, nor did we have jobs. At least we can save money that we are spending here for shelter. We will come back once everything gets settled.”1,200 migrants from Vasai leaves for GorakhpurAround 1,200 migrants from Vasai left for Gorakhpur, on another Shramik Express train on Sunday morning. The migrants, who were staying at camps, were issued tickets and charged around ₹740 for the trip.Rahul Bhalerao, district information officer (DIO), Palghar, said, “We took details of the migrants and also conducted medical tests for coronavirus symptoms. Social distancing norms were followed and around 48 passengers were allowed in each coach of the train which left at 4.15am. Each passenger was provided with food packets, water, masks, and sanitiser for the 1,806-km trip which should be covered within 30 hours, as the train would have limited halts.” Bhalegao added that around 5,500 migrants are stranded in Palghar district, as per official data.District collector Dr Kailas Shinde and other officials were present at the railhead to send off the migrants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/took-all-precautions-on-migrant-train-from-bhiwandi-says-cr/story-YDidskI32AuJNyrhurVkSM.html
03-05-2020||Chandigarh||Social distancing a challenge for restarting PGIMER OPDs, panels formed to gauge options||Social distancing in the outpatient departments (OPDs) at the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), closed since March 20, will remain a major concern once open, probably soon, as hospital authorities have set up two sub-panels to examine standard operating procedures (SOPs) to restart the service.A panel headed by Dr GD Puri, dean academics, set up earlier by Prof Jagat Ram, PGIMER director, had recommended the number of patients to be allowed at the OPDs in pursuance of social distancing norms.“We cannot go easy on the precautions while providing services. The basic thing is to restrict the number of patients, otherwise the situation can go out of control,” Prof Jagat Ram said.Dr Puri’s committee had recommended a system of pre-appointments for patients to help the institute prepare the OPD accordingly. “This will give the institute control over the number of patients expected to come for consultations,” a senior official said.Strengthening of telemedicine services was also suggested.The two-subpanels will formulate SOPs for restarting OPD services after factoring in the recommendations. The sub-panel will be headed by Dr SK Gupta, head of neurosciences department and include members from the pulmonary medicine department and hospital administration, an engineer from the construction division, OPD nursing superintendent and nursing association leaders.The second panel for modalities regarding functioning of radiology and laboratories will be headed by Dr Naveen Kalra from the radiology department and Dr Arnab Pal from the biochemistry department.Meanwhile, no decision has been taken to restart the OPD at the Government Multi-Specialty Hospital, Sector 16 and Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32.UT health secretary Arun Kumar Gupta said it could take time.Meanwhile, dispensaries are functioning routinely, officials said.The PGIMER OPDs, including the new OPD building, advanced paediatric centre, advanced eye centre and advanced cardiac centre have a footfall of 10,000 average patients in a day, with a major chunk of patients from the neighbouring states seeking super-specialty consultations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/social-distancing-a-challenge-for-restarting-pgimer-opds-panels-formed-to-gauge-options/story-CijZpjaHzIUN0jDMp0EIaO.html

03-05-2020||Chandigarh||Covid-19 cases double in three days, Punjab among 10 worst-hit states||The Covid-19 cases in Punjab are doubling in three days following a spike triggered by pilgrims from Nanded town in Maharashtra.The doubling rate of infected cases was 18 days on April 25 and then slipped to 13.1 days on April 29 before crashing to three days as more and more returnees entered the state and tested positive. The total number of coronavirus cases in the state stood at 380 – 1.15% of the total 33,021 cases across India, on Wednesday, but surged to 977 in the next three days, taking its share of positive cases to 2.44% of the total 39,911 on May 2. On Sunday, the state’s tally rose to 1,128.The sharp spike has put Punjab among the 10 worst-hit states in the country, according to data compiled jointly by the Union ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW) and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). The nine states which have more covid-19 cases than Punjab are Maharashtra, Gujarat, Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, and Telangana. With the jump in positive cases, the death or mortality rate has also come down to 2.17% from close to 7% more than two weeks ago. There have been 24 Covid-19 deaths – three of these were reported on Sunday – in the state so far.ONE IN THREE RETURNEES TESTS POSITIVEA total of 4,169 people returned or were ferried to the state from the Hazur Sahib gurdwara in Nanded in the past week. Though the state health department has taken the samples of all of them, 1,785 samples have been tested so far, out of which 609 – one in every three – returnees have tested positive, as per the official figures at 6pm on Sunday.The pilgrims were at Nanded since March 25 when the national lockdown was announced to stem the coronavirus spread. After frantic appeals from them and some political leaders across the political spectrum, chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh had written to Union home minister Amit Shah and his Maharashtra counterpart Uddhav Thackeray to help evacuate the devotees. However, no one had anticipated that their return would trigger the second wave of the virus that has pushed the state’s count into four digits. These fresh cases are posing a serious challenge even as the state is relaxing the curfew restrictions in most districts from Monday.AMRITSAR, HOSHIARPUR LATEST HOTSPOTSThe Union health and family welfare ministry had classified three districts – Jalandhar, Patiala, and Ludhiana – among the 130 red zones on Thursday night, but most of these new cases have been reported from other areas, except Ludhiana where the number of cases has jumped from 29 on April 29 to 111 on May 3, an increase of 283%.Amritsar, Hoshiarpur, Bathinda, Gurdaspur, Tarn Taran, Muktsar, and SBS Nagar are among the districts where the positive cases have also grown exponentially in the past few days.

03-05-2020||City||Bihar BJP chief’s FB post sets off war of words in NDA||PATNASpread of Coronavirus pandemic has once again brought the differences within the NDA to the fore in Bihar, which if all goes well, will go to polls later this year. Top state BJP leaders, including state unit president, have raised serious questions over the style of functioning of the state government.On the contrary, BJP’s alliance partner, the JD (U) has defended the “Nitish Model” of dealing with lockdown as the most effective.The latest spark flew after BJP’s Bihar president put out a post on his Facebook and questioned state government’s “lacklustre approach” in dealing with migrant issue. “The problem with Bihar government is that none of their officials clarify before the media as to which types of shops will open in which zone or which train is coming to Bihar and where to get registered. As a result of state government’s attitude, people are posting on social media whatever they want. The state government should take lessons from Yogi government in UP. UP chief secretary briefs media very well,” Jaiswal, the West Champaran MP, said in his post.The BJP state president’s post, coming at the time of pandemic, has caused ripples in NDA with many BJP leaders questioning the timing of such statements. Only on Saturday, the state government had issued clarifications on reports that nodal officers are incommunicado and released fresh helpline numbers. The state government also announced details of trains which would be coming with migrants and students. A section of BJP leaders, led by MLC Nawal Kishore Yadav, tried to do the damage control by praising CM Nitish Kumar. “There is no better CM in country than Nitish Kumar,” he said and refused to draw parallels with UP CM Yogi. “I do not know anything about Yogi government’s work. He is a better CM, that is why BJP is supporting him,” he said.The JD (U) came out in defence of Kumar and said that the Bihar CM does not believe in “populist measures.’“Bihar didn’t commit the mistakes which states like UP or Punjab did. Bihar’s CM measures have been more protective, more answerable than his counterparts of UP and Punjab. Had he not adhered to the centre’s guidelines, the numbers of positive cases would have been more,” argued JD (U) national principal general secretary, K C Tyagi. “Bihar model has saved Bihar,” he added and said that every party has the right to place its view.Jaiswal’s barb has given the opposition another opportunity to attack the Nitish government.RJD spokesperson Bhai Birendra said the government needed to reply on the issue raised by the BJP president. “When we raised the issue, it irked JD (U) leaders. We had been demanding extraction of students but the Nitish government turned it down citing lockdown norms,” he said. Leader of opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav said that the state government has no definite action plan to bring people stuck in different states. “The nodal officers have switched off their mobile phones or cannot be reached. The state government is also charging tickets from migrants,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bihar-bjp-chief-s-fb-post-sets-off-war-of-words-in-nda/story-q0jPzssK2SDiP0HFGAPJVO.html
03-05-2020||Patna||Choppers showering flowers on Bihar hospitals lifts mood of medics, patients alike||Doctors, nurses and other staff at the Nalanda Medical College Hospital (NMCH) and the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Patna were a delighted lot on Sunday as choppers showered flower petals atop their building as part of the exercise to express gratitude towards the front line warriors against the coronavirus pandemic.The NMCH and AIIMS-Patna are among the four medical college hospitals dedicated to Covid-19 in the state.Doctors, nurses, paramedics and housekeeping staff lined up at the two hospitals outside the outdoor patient department (OPD), while some stayed on terrace of indoor patient department (IPD), wearing hospital uniform and personal protective suit, and maintaining proper physical distancing, to acknowledge the gesture.“It was an unprecedented and unimaginable gesture. They (personnel of the Indian armed forces) are the true warriors, but a situation has come up now where we (as doctors) have also been labelled as warriors. So, it was one warrior saluting another. It was undoubtedly a wonderful gesture which has boosted our morale further,” said Dr Prabhat Kumar Singh, director AIIMS-Patna.At the NMCH, the first dedicated facility for Covid-19 positive cases in Bihar, the atmosphere was truly electric as the entire hospital staff, including doctors, nurses, paramedics and housekeeping employees, basked in the glory they all richly deserved for serving the patients day in and day out with a commendable recovery rate.Attired in personal protective suit and wearing masks, they all took a small break to accept the respect the Indian armed forces showered on them from blue skies, waving Indian Tricolour, cheering, clapping and singing patriotic songs.As the reverberating sound of the helicopters approached, all eyes were looking in the skies. The NMCH ground was full, with everyone apparently overwhelmed with emotions and eager to capture the moment in their mobile phones.“It is a great morale booster for all those involved with healthcare in one way or the other. It is a big day for us. The symbolic appreciation for the healthcare staff from the Indian armed forces on such a scale is something we don’t remember having ever seen. It is a great feeling that the Indian armed forces and the people are looking to us with positivity,” said NMCH nodal officer Dr Ajay Kumar Sinha.Sinha, flanked by doctors, said it was also time to realise that in the midst of pandemic, there was no place for negativity. “I am always optimistic that Coronavirus will also go, like it happened with other viral attacks in the past. But till it goes, everyone should maintain social distancing and encourage it as part of social responsibility,” he said.Dr Mukul Kumar of the NMCH said it was a great honour for all healthcare personnel and it would remain etched in their memory for lifetime. “Indian forces are always on the front line, saving our borders. Their appreciation for us means a lot,” he added.The nurses also seemed energised by the recognition, as they sang “Veer tum badhe chalo ...” as the Indian Air Force (IAF) helicopters showers flowers from above. “It was a fantastic feeling. It makes us feel special. We are discharging our responsibilities in the midst of the pandemic with full devotion, but we never expected such a big honour,” said senior nurse Mamta Sinha, Anuradha Chourasia and a group of nurses, overpowered by emotions.The patients admitted at the hospital, too, seemed energised as they looked at the spectacle through the windows and singing paeans to the hospital staff for all the care. “Now I am more confident that my relative will be recovering soon to get back home. The doctors and healthcare staff deserved it, as they are the ones who are risking their lives to save others,” said Alok Kumar, who was outside the hospital at the gate.Of the 119 Covid-19 patients to have recovered in Bihar so far, 64 were discharged from the NMCH and one from the AIIMS-Patna. The hospitals have reported two deaths each of Covid-19 patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/choppers-showering-flowers-on-bihar-hospitals-lifts-mood-of-medics-patients-alike/story-Y7gQBaKpbKQQ7U9xbCM0SP.html
03-05-2020||Patna||No green zone, only red and orange ones as Bihar goes for strict lockdown norms||The state home department on Sunday issued fresh guidelines on lockdown by deciding to classify 38 districts in the state as red and orange zones only and contending that there was need for more strict implementation of the ongoing restrictions to contain the spread of Covid-19 in view of the rise of number of Corona cases in new areas and return of migrants, students from other states.The order issued by additional chief secretary, home, Amir Subhani, on Sunday evening said the state would have only two zones with red zones districts to be declared as per laid down norms of the central government from time to time while rest of the districts to be considered as orange zones.The new order said lockdown norms, as laid by the central government, would be applicable in red zones as usual with clause 7(iii)d related to opening of shops to be applicable for shops only for essential commodities. The order said the DMs of respective districts in red zones could take a decision on allowing shops of other non-esesential commodities by assessing the requirement and ground situation of the area.In districts in orange zones, activities like purchase of goods and delivery through e-commerce ( essential and non-essential) , construction activities ( all types) , industrial activity would be allowed. The new activity allowed in orange zones is operationalisation of barber shops, salons and spas.“All other restrictions and orders would be applicable in orange zones as like red zones,” the order stated. The new guidelines indicated how the Bihar government is not in favour of lifting restriction in place as a precaution to contain the spread of the virus , amid reports of spike in cases of positive cases. The state’s total number of positive cases crossed 500 on Sunday with four deaths reported so far.As per the order issued by the union government on April 30, Bihar had five red zones including Patna, Rohtas, Munger, Gaya and Buxar while 20 districts had been put in orange zones while rest 13 in green zones.

03-05-2020||Chandigarh||SAD, Congress trade barbs as over 600 Nanded pilgrims contract coronavirus||A war of words erupted between Punjab Health Minister Balbir Singh Sidhu and Akali leader Bikram Singh Majithia on Sunday as the state’s coronavirus count crossed 1,000 with over 600 Sikh pilgrims returning from Maharshtra’s Nanded testing positive for the infection. While Majithia accused the state government of “mismanaging” the return of the pilgrims from the Nanded’s Hazur Sahib gurdwara and sought the minister’s sacking, Sidhu hit back at the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), daring its leaders to apologise for their “misleading propaganda”. So far, 609 of the 4,000 pilgrims who recently returned from Nanded have tested positive for coronavirus. Health Minister Sidhu in a statement here said the pilgrims contracted the disease before entering Punjab while stressing that ‘sewadars’ of the gurdwara have also tested positive for the virus. Religious leaders have testified that Nanded pilgrims were tested in Maharashtra but the Punjab government did not receive any test report from the state government till now, said Sidhu, who is under fire from the Opposition. Lashing out at SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal, Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal and former state minister Bikram Singh Majithia, Sidhu accused them of “indulging in political one-upmanship” over a sensitive issue, that too “without verifying facts”. “These leaders unnecessarily hyped this issue by spreading this propaganda that pilgrims are being labelled as coronavirus positive as part of a conspiracy,” said Sidhu. By politicising this issue, Akali leaders were not only trying to demoralise all frontline warriors who are going beyond their call of duty to save Punjab but also giving false and fabricated comments over such a sensitive issue, Sidhu alleged. Sidhu said there is no need to worry or panic after the spike in cases with the return of pilgrims. He said the pilgrims have been given the best treatment and also assured that the state will recover from the challenge just as it did first from situations arising out of the return of foreigners and then Tablighi Jamaat members. Meanwhile, Majithia asked Chief Minister Amarinder Singh to sack Sidhu from the cabinet. Majithia alleged that Sidhu had started defaming the pilgrims by stating that they had spoiled all the good work done by the Punjab government in controlling COVID-19. Stating that the “good work” of the Health Department has already been exposed by health workers who had “failed” to get PPE kits and facilities like ambulances and ventilators, the Akali leader said Sidhu has proven to be “utterly incompetent” and should quit his post immediately. Majithia claimed that it was a fact that the Punjab government did not follow the ICMR guidelines while repatriating the pilgrims. He said air-conditioned buses were used against established norms. “Social distancing was not followed. The buses came through red zones and it was because of this mishandling that pilgrims, who were in good health in Nanded for more than one month, tested positive for COVID-19 on their return to Punjab”, claimed Majithia. He said this had also been borne out by the statement of Congress minister from Maharashtra Ashok Chavan who blamed the Punjab government for the plight of the pilgrims. Majithia said the Congress-led government had first targeted NRIs and was now targeting Sikhs. “If the state government commits mistakes in repatriation by mishandling the operation, it should not try to put the blame on others,” he said. He also sought from the Punjab government to shift the pilgrims to the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee ‘sarais’ for quarantine purposes. He claimed that the pilgrims from Nanded have been quarantined in unhygienic government facilities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/sad-congress-trade-barbs-as-over-600-nanded-pilgrims-contract-coronavirus/story-E7UzYOhB300s1cg4cTxhpI.html

03-05-2020||Chandigarh||Steepest single-day spike in Haryana with 66 new cases||Haryana recorded on Sunday steepest single-day spike in Covid-19 cases with 66 new infections reported from its nine districts, which took the state’s tally to 442.As per the health bulletin, 18 of these cases were reported from Sonepat district, where the virus has spread among a section of doctors. Meanwhile, Rohtak PGIMS on Sunday confirmed the death of a corona patient from Gurugram. PGIMS spokesperson Gajender Singh said the infected man was admitted on April 30 and died on Saturday night.According to Dr Suraj Bhan Kamboj, director health services, most of the patients found infected in last few days are either residents of Haryana working in Delhi or Delhi-based people posted in NCR districts of the state. Movement of vegetable sellers, he said, who visited Delhi also led to spurt in infections. Though the state health department mentioned only 18 cases in Sonepat, deputy commissioner Ansaj Singh said the district saw 20 new cases, including those of three resident doctors of Bhagat Phool Singh medical college at Khanpur. Besides, the DC said, one doctor of a private hospital and one from civil hospital also tested positive. “Most of the remaining cases are the contacts of infected patients. All new patients have been shifted to BPS, Khanpur Kalan. We do not plan to impose curfew in the district,” he added. Sonepat was followed by Faridabad with 12 cases, Panipat (11), Gurugram (9), Jind (6), Fatehabad (4) and Jhajjar, Palwal and Yamunanagar (2 each).

03-05-2020||Pune||At least 20% of people infected with Covid-19 developed symptoms of acute kidney injury: report||At least twenty per cent of the people who have been infected with Sars-cov-2 virus which causes the Covid-19 (coronavirus) infection have developed abnormalities in kidneys, according to a report by International Society of Nephrology (ISN).According to the report these abnormalities manifested as a substantial leak of protein and blood in urine, resulting in the development of Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) in close to 15 per cent patients, hinting that Covid-19 also attacks the kidney.Dr Tarun Jalokha, nephrologist, Aditya Birla Hospital, said, “In the current pandemic, it has been reported and shared on a webcast from Italy and USA that Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT) is the preferred modality of choice for dialysing patients of Covid-19 infection with acute kidney injury.”“At some hospitals in the US, it was shared on a webcast that a load of patients were so huge that they were able to give CRRT only for 12 hours in a patient at a time and shifting to another patient. Hence, in absence of resources or even exhaustion of resources because of the huge and sudden burden of patients in ICUs, other modalities like conventional dialysis, SLED and Peritoneal dialysis also have been used to manage such patients,” Dr Jalokha.“ All these modalities are complementary to each other and as patients improve, alternative modalities between all these can be utilised to get best possible results,” said Dr Jalokha.The current treatment of Covid-19 with acute kidney injury includes general and supportive management and kidney replacement therapy. In the absence of effective antiviral therapy with smaller proportion requiring acute or urgent dialysis, Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT) a term used for a collection of acute dialysis techniques can support these patients for 24 hours in a day especially to the critically ill patients suffering from acute kidney injury or having an overwhelming immune response.Dr Aklesh Tandekar, intensivist, Apollo Hospital, said, “Patients of Covid-19 have severe cytokine storm suggested by elevated IL-6 levels which is responsible for organ dysfunction. Cytokine storm and fluid shifts control can translate into better outcomes.”“Previous studies show that CRRT had been successfully applied in the treatment of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) illnesses related to previously known coronaviruses, which also manifested as respiratory illnesses,” said Dr Tandekar.“At relatively higher doses, it can help clear the immune toxins, thus suggesting CRRT may play a role in patients with Covid-19 with acute kidney injury or high immune toxin load”, said Dr Tandekar.Tandekar said, “In situations where shifts in fluid balance and metabolic fluctuations are poorly tolerated and in situations where other extracorporeal therapies are required, CRRT can be used as an integrated system and is preferred over parallel systems, as was highlighted by a recently published retrospective cohort study.”“In the study, it was found that 36 Covid-19 patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, where CRRT was associated with a reduction in mortality than those treated without CRRT. However, the potential role of extracorporeal therapy techniques needs to be evaluated by the treating physician,” said Dr Tandekar.Experts are unanimous that acute dialysis techniques such as CRRT may also be effective in treating patients with Covid-19 and sepsis syndrome irrespective of their kidney function. Considering the ongoing scenario and the increasing rate of kidney involvement due to Covid-19, such extracorporeal therapies may play an important role in the treatment of severely ill patients. Right treatment by the experts at the right time can save the lives of the infected people who are battling between life and death, say experts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/at-least-20-of-people-infected-with-covid-19-developed-symptoms-of-acute-kidney-injury-report/story-6M0OjE2FYx36wkqcTOhcCL.html
03-05-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab to develop machines for direct seeding of rice amid labour dearth||Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), Ludhiana, in collaborate with the state agriculture department is making a machine for direct seeding of rice (DSR) for which 175 units manufacturing agricultural implements in the state have been roped in.PAU has given a prototype to the manufacturers and the agriculture and industries departments are engaging Mandi Gobindgarh-based raw material suppliers for the task.The varsity experts have advised farmers to opt for direct seeded rice variety of paddy in the upcoming kharif season to make up for the shortage of labour in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic. Around 70 lakh acres of land is expected to be under paddy cultivation in the state in the upcoming season.The new variety, according to PAU researchers, would save the farmers from two labour-intensive steps of traditional paddy sowing — setting up of nurseries and then transplanting the saplings in the puddled fields. PAU’s new DSR technique was successfully tested during the last kharif season.“The machine design is ready and we are tying up with the agricultural implements manufacturing units in Moga, Barnala, Sangrur, Patiala, Nabha and Ludhiana to produce these equipment on war footing,” agriculture secretary Kahan Singh Pannu told HT. He added that under the sub-mission on agricultural mechanisation (SMAM), there will be 40% subsidy on the new machines which cost ₹65,000 to ₹70,000.Recommending PR126 as the direct seeded rice variety, PAU vice-chancellor B S Dhillon said, “In this new technique, the fields are levelled and irrigated to create good soil moisture conditions. Then, paddy is sown using these machines.”The PR-126 variety has shown best results and the yield is as much as transplanted paddy, he added saying that the trials were conducted for the past three seasons.“After harvesting and procurement of wheat, the next worry for Punjab farmers is paddy sowing. Amid the Covid-19 lockdown, labourers engaged in paddy transplantation have gone back to their native states. Now, Punjab farmers are left with no option but to adopt alternative sowing techniques,” Dhillon added.“At least 500 Korean and Japanese machines are also available for direct sowing and as many additional machines will be developed in two months. These machines could sow paddy on 1.25 lakh acres of land. The government is offering 40% subsidy on them,” the VC said.MODIFIED HAPPY SEEDERS, ZERO TILL DRILLS FOR SOWINGPannu said there are 2 lakh machines in the state for sowing wheat such as happy seeders, zero till drills and other drill machines which could also be used for paddy sowing with minor alterations. “We have experimented on a few wheat sowing machines and it cost ₹1,000 to make them compatible for direct paddy sowing,” said Pannu.FOOD DEPT TOLD TO TEST DSR VARIETYChief minister Capt Amarinder Singh has directed the food and civil supplies department to test the PR126 DSR variety so that it makes a good crop for procurement and lifting for the public distribution system in the country. Department joint director (procurement and storage) Anjuman Bhaskar said she would study the details of the said crop’s trials. “Any wheat or paddy crop sown on a large scale needs to be compatible for procurement as well,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-to-develop-machines-for-direct-seeding-of-rice-amid-labour-dearth/story-SEKWxdd62shivVoBkippjJ.html

03-05-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana bans paddy cultivation on panchayat land in 8 blocks||In an attempt to arrest the water table decline, the Haryana government has banned the cultivation of paddy on panchayat land ahead of the sowing season.These eight blocks include Assandh in Karnal district, Pundri in Kaithal district, Radaur in Yamunanagar district, Ambala-I and Saha in Ambala district, Thanesar in Kurukshetra district, Narwana in Jind district and Gannaur in Sonepat district.The government has issued directions to the deputy commissioners concerned to ensure that the panchayat land lease out to farmers is not used for cultivating paddy in the coming season.As per the officials in the state agriculture department, the move will help the government achieve its target of diversifying around 1 lakh hectares of land, out of the total 12.50 lakh hectares under the water-guzzling paddy crop in the state.They said the government was also considering increasing the amount of cash incentive provided to farmers adopting crop diversification on their own land.“The decision will not only help save the ground water, but also reduce the number of incidents of stubble burning in the state as most of the blocks indentified for this project are known for cultivating paddy, said Surender Yadav, deputy director of state agriculture department.However, the decision has evoked a mixed response from farmers as many claimed that the move would affect landless and small farmers, who depend on panchayat land.Some sarpanches in the identified blocks opined that the decision would reduce panchayats’ income as the farmers would hesitate in taking the land on lease due to the alternate crops not being profitable enough.Karnal deputy commissioner Nishant Yadav said, “We have issued the directions to village panchayats in the Assandh block and the farmers will not be allowed to grow paddy on the panchayat land here.”“After the notification, the auction of panchayat land has been deferred and will be held after May 10 as per the government’s instructions,” said Yamunanagar deputy commissioner Mukul Kumar.Last year, the state government had introduced ‘Jal Hi Jeevan Hai’ diversification scheme with a target to shift about 50,000 hectares of land from paddy to other crops in seven out of the aforementioned eight blocks. Even cash subsidies of ₹4,500 per hectare were awarded to the farmers besides free seeds and free crop insurance cover for adopting the crop diversification technique.Last month, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar had urged various union leaders to encourage farmers to adopt crop diversification.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-bans-paddy-cultivation-on-panchayat-land-in-8-blocks/story-mied4iYCBT2Ql2RftKoIdP.html

Some of his neighbours commented that the party was organised either on April 17 or 23. However, we are not sure that it is authentic information.”Earlier, Dr Chavan’s disclosure had sent the UT administration and police in a tizzy, prompting UT administrator VP Singh Badnore to order an inquiry into the matter and also directing director general of police (DGP) Sanjay Baniwal to initiate criminal proceedings against the patient for violating curfew orders and not observing social distancing norms. Official explanation regarding lapses on their part is awaited from Sector 26 station house officer (SHO) Narinder Patial and deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Dilsher Singh Chandel, even as the Bapu Dham police post in-charge Gurmeet Singh has been replaced.‘HOUSE NOT BIG ENOUGH TO HOST OVER 100 PEOPLE’On inspecting the patient’s neighbourhood, senior cops found that he lived with 19 family members in a house built on a little over a marla (27 square yards). “The rooftop where the party is being claimed to have taken place is 9 feet by 30 feet in size. It cannot accommodate more than 100 guests,” said a senior official, familiar to the matter, requesting anonymity.So far, 43 people from the OT attendant’s contact list have been tested positive in Bapu Dham Colony. The area has been declared an “affected pocket”, with just one entry and exit point, which is being manned by the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/not-sure-bapu-dham-party-information-was-authentic-gmch-doctor-to-police/story-KYkd55vnPAMxYhxb7axX3O.html

The private schools in Panchkula are yet to pay salaries to employees and are seeking a reply from the department for their representation.In its letter, the association wrote, “We have not asked any parent to pay the school fee immediately; however, a few parents have themselves come forward to deposit the fee voluntarily.”PPSA secretary Piyush Punj said, “There are about 75 private schools in the district and presently, these schools are unable to generate revenue with only 5% to 10% parents depositing the fee voluntarily.”“Those who are able to pay are consciously considering the lockdown period as a fee-free period. The things are becoming worse making it difficult for the managements to fulfill liabilities, including payment of salaries of teachers and other staff,” said Punj.He said that the association will wait for the response till May 10, after which it will decide the further course of action accordingly. “In Pinjore, only a couple of schools have received fee and that too from 5% parents,” he said, adding, “Majority schools in Panchkula have till date not received appropriate fee from 10% students, who have been being given admission free of cost under Section 134A of Haryana School Education (Third Amendment) Rules.Emphasising that schoolteachers should not be made to bear the losses, the association members said, “Teachers have been doing their best despite hectic routines with online classes for the students’ welfare, but they are not being considered among the frontline covid warriors,” while adding that the government should also think about the educators working for the future and betterment of children. and should not be made to bear unsustainable losses.Panchkula district education officer (DEO) Urmila Rohilla said, “The decision and further course of action lies with the head office. There is a separate fee regulatory body and action committee of the directorate that takes a call on such issues. I came across about the representation submitted by the schools association, but nothing on the same has been received so far. However, I have sent notices to some schools seeking reply from them after receiving complaints from few parents regarding the fee issue.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/private-schools-in-panchkula-to-move-to-court-regarding-voluntary-payment-of-fee/story-m06mB6xmyOxI2jNKZE5iVI.html

Most of them are asymptomatic.Things are good, “We get morning tea and healthy meals three times a day and the menu is changed every week. There are around 30 beds and a television set in each ward,” said a patient.The Punjab government had on March 17 designated the 300-bed Gian Sagar hospital as its quarantine centre.Patients are being admitted there since March 25, and 32 have already been released after recovering from the disease.“Our frontline doctors and medical staff always keep the patients in good humour. We have toys for children in the wards and the menu can be changed if they want it so. At present, we have a seven-year-old patient with us. Almost all the patients are asymptomatic and are responding well to treatment,” said Dr SPS Goraya, medical superintendent of the hospital.As most patients have their mobile phones with them, the hospital was planning to provide WiFi services in the wards, Dr Goraya added. A 58-year-old man from Premgarh village who was admitted on April 30 after testing positive upon his return from Sri Hazur Sahib in Nanded, Maharashtra, said “13 of my family members who also tested positive are admitted here. We feel at home over here and most of us spend time watching TV, talking to other family members on the phone and regaling each other with funny stories. We don’t have any symptoms and feel hale and hearty. It’s hard to believe we have Covid-19,” he said.A 55-year-old patient from Amrala village in Dera Bassi said most of the patients were related to each other and passing time talking to each other and gossiping. “We are calling up relatives and also receiving calls from our near and dear ones and others who wish us well.”She says she does miss home, but hopes to go back “as the days are passing by quickly.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/singing-songs-gossiping-covid-19-patients-at-banur-hospital-keep-spirits-high/story-KCQkSm2uiGZGArDoezfFqK.html

Manoj Parida, took to Twitter, to bring clarity on decisions taken by UT administrator VP Singh Badnore regarding the lifting of restrictions in the city from Monday onward.Most questions revolved around the unfamiliar concept of odd-even for shops and vehicles. Using witty one liners while acknowledging the confusion, Parida responded to more than 700 questions from his Twitter handle.As per the odd-even formula, shops and vehicles with odd numbers will be allowed to run on dates that end with an odd number, and similarly, those with even numbers can run on even dates.Pointing out the formula’s impracticality, Twitter user Akshit asked Parida that if his shop number is odd and his vehicle number is even, how would he go to his shop? Parida suggested he open his shop every second day, assuming the shop was that of an essential service.When Parida encouraged carpooling, Mitrabh Gupta said he lived in Zirakpur and has a milk business in Chandigarh, which makes it impossible to carpool. To this, Parida said, “Bad luck, wait till we change our orders.”When another Twitter user asked him about the odd-even rule, Parida, in jest, said the person could consider exchanging his car with the owner of a neighboring shop till rules were in effect. He also encouraged people to cycle to their shops rather than use vehicles, something which the World Health Organisation (WHO) has also recommended.When user Anmol Bhardwaj pointed out that shops in Chandigarh villages including those of Palsora village do not have shop numbers, Parida suggested he should “enjoy the confusion”.Finally, Parida assured everyone that the move was only temporary and all stakeholders including the adviser and the administrator will reconsider the decision before implementing it.Chandigarh Residents Association Welfare Federation (CRAWFED) had also written to Badnore, highlighting the confusion the odd-even rule would bring, suggesting that the odd-even rule be applied to shop numbers only, and not vehicles.Later, during the war-room briefings with UT administrator VP Singh Badnore, on Sunday, the administration decided to forgo the odd-even proposal, citing the confusion that was likely to creates more issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/using-wit-and-jest-ut-adviser-clarifies-chandigarh-s-odd-even-rule-on-twitter/story-EIMnLeqUuv9mwswsazCFyJ.html
03-05-2020||City||As Covid-19 peaks, beware of advertisers peddling false claims regarding the virus||Covid-19 has completely changed our lives- I am not just referring to the lockdown , the social distancing, frequent hand washing and sanitizing surfaces and goods. Today, all our conversation is centred around Covid , just as almost all news is Covid-related.It’s therefore no wonder that advertisers too are trying to somehow link their products directly or indirectly to Covid or the circumstances surrounding it , to make it relevant and attract attention. Some are also using their advertisements for social messaging. But on the flip side, there are also advertisements blatantly peddling products through false or misleading claims related to Covid-19. One such claim that attracted the most attention was of course the Arihant mattress advertisement in a Gujarati newspaper that went viral on the social media for its claim that the mattress was ‘ corona-resistant’ and ‘anti-corona virus’ !. The mattress maker soon found himself booked under various laws including the Disaster Management Act and the Drugs and Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisements) Act by the Maharashtra Food and Drug Administration. Besides those that make blatantly false claims and offer ‘cures’ for Covid -19 , there are also advertisements that employ cleverly worded messages and deceptive visuals to misrepresent the importance or the need for such products to fight the dreaded disease.Well, there are several laws aimed at curbing such advertising and protecting consumers. . The Drugs and Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisements ) Act for example, specifically prohibits such false and misleading advertisements relating to drugs, besides remedies claiming magical or miraculous properties. The law prescribes as punishment, imprisonment up to six months or fine or both for the first offence and imprisonment up to one year or fine or both for subsequent offence. False or deceptive advertisements pertaining to food are specifically governed by the Food Safety and Standards (Advertising and Claims) Regulations and enforced by the state food safety officers. Violation of the Regulation attracts a penalty up to Rs 10 lakhs as per Section 53 of the Food Safety and Standards Act.I must also mention that in response to complaints about Covid-related deceptive and false claims , the union ministry of Ayurveda, Yoga, Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy (AYUSH) has on April 1, issued an order under Section 33P of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, directing the regulatory authorities in states and union territories to “stop and prevent publicity and advertisement of AYUSH-related claims for Covid-19 in print, television and electronic media and take necessary action against the persons/agencies involved in contravening the relevant legal provisions …”. The ministry has also asked the Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI), a self regulatory body of the advertising industry, to monitor and report such advertisements. The Cable Television Network Regulation Act and Rules also prohibit deceptive advertising. The Rules in fact ban television advertisements that violate the Code for Self Regulation in Advertising , formulated and adopted by ASCI.The regulatory body- the Central Consumer Protection Authority- envisaged under the Consumer Protection Act of 2019 has wide ranging powers to deal with all deceptive, false advertisements. Unfortunately, the Authority is yet to be constituted. The consumer courts have the power to order withdrawal of such advertisements, direct issuance of corrective advertisements and award costs and compensation to consumers, but only on a complaint from the consumer or the government. Unlike the Authority, the forums have no suo moto powers.Meanwhile consumers who come across questionable Covid-related claims can complain to the state drug control authorities or the food safety authorities, depending on the nature of the advertisement. They can also register their complaint on the website specifically created by the union ministry of consumer affairs for the purpose—Grievances Against Misleading Advertisements - gama.gov.in One can also complain to ASCI on its website- ascionline.org or on their whatsapp number: 7710012345 .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/as-covid-19-peaks-beware-of-advertisers-peddling-false-claims-regarding-the-virus/story-Gfj9VnT4A6vMJJxyx9bgSN.html

But in both these places, there is a ban on leaving the house in many places, in such a situation, the government did not clarify how people trapped here would be able to reach the designated places.He said that at this time the situation has been made like one during the partition of the country.“Instead of appointing nodal officers, the government should set up a call centre to facilitate the people,” he said.He said that the state should also set up a system to screen all the people returning to the state.Sharma also demanded the state and the Centre evacuate the people stranded in the foreign countries with the help of the Indian Air Force.Restore unemployment allowance scheme: GS BaliSenior Congress leader and former minister GS Bali on Sunday demanded the state government to provide unemployment allowance to jobless youth in the state.In a press release issued here, Bali said that the previous government had started the unemployment allowance scheme under which the jobless youth were being provided ₹1000 to ₹1500 per month.Implementation of the scheme becomes even more important as an estimated 5 lakh youth have been rendered unemployed due to the lockdown imposed in the wake of Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/congress-flays-hp-govt-for-mismanagement-of-evacuation-process/story-aYr0J8QfN8g0Ep5REgR6TP.html

03-05-2020||Chandigarh||12-hr relaxation will leave shopkeepers vulnerable, says Chandigarh traders’ body||UT administration’s decision to allow sector markets to remain open between 7am and 7pm from Monday left several shopkeepers jittery about their safety.Giving in to demands of shopkeepers, the timings were reduced to eight hours, between 10am and 6pm, during the review meeting on Sunday evening.“Opening shops for more than five hours doesn’t make sense. Shopkeepers will be exposed dealing with the public for such a long time. We will ask the administration to consider this,” said Charanjiv Singh, chairman, Chandigarh Beopar Mandal. He added that the Beopar Mandal will call a meeting in a couple of days to discuss any issues being faced by the traders.SOCIAL DISTANCING IMPOSSIBLE IN SMALLER MARKETSIn cramped markets, such as Palika Bazaar and Sadar Bazaar in Sector 19 and Krishna Market in Sector 41, shopkeepers claim social distancing was a distant dream. “Most booths here are 8 by 8 feet. Even if we are given the permission to reopen, the market committee may take a decision to keep the shops closed for a few more days,” said Narinder Singh, president of the Sadar Bazaar Market Association in Sector 19.‘SHOULD HAVE TESTED SOCIAL DISTANCING IN SECTOR 17’On the other hand, keeping the shops in Sector 17 closed has not gone down well with some traders. Neeraj Bajaj, president of Chandigarh Business Council, said, “Sector 17 has spacious shops with ample parking and corridor space. Sector 17 should have been the first market to reopen to test social distancing. While the offices here will remain open, the traders are feeling left out.”RESIDENT BODIES DIVIDED TOO Resident bodies have also given a mixed response to the administration’s decision. Chairman of Federation of Sector Welfare Associations Chandigarh (FOSWAC), Baljinder Singh Bittu said, “The administration has taken a bold decision and we stand behind it. The city cannot stop just because of Covid-19, and sooner or later, routine life will have to resume.”However, Chandigarh Residents Association Welfare Federation (CRAWFED) chairman Hitesh Puri said, “Restrictions should have been lifted in a phased manner. 12-hour relaxation is too long when there is no let-up in fresh cases.”“The administration needs to look out for the labour force. Their food service must not stop and they need to be provided gainful employment as well,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/12-hr-relaxation-will-leave-shopkeepers-vulnerable-says-chandigarh-traders-body/story-WQptk0vdojzZRcxTHgJuqI.html

Through the campaign on social media, activists from NatConnect Foundation and Shri Ekvira Aai Pratishtan (SEAP) have appealed to various civic bodies to impose hefty fines, to the tune of Rs 5,000 per offence, and making violators clean the spit. “The campaign #SirUthakeThuko targets the people who are habitual paan and tobacco chewers and spit in public places,” said BN Kumar, director, NatConnect Foundation. “People have been lifting their face masks and continue to spit on roads,” said Nandkumar Pawar, head, SEAP. “We are being repeatedly told by doctors that the novel coronavirus spreads through droplets. Under such circumstances, spitting is even worse,” said Nandakumar Pawar, head, SEAP. The campaign has been widely shared on social media and representations have been made to the state government by citizens to ensure the penalty is imposed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/environmentalists-launch-campaign-to-stop-spitting/story-oGwWTaHiPfgp7a5Iz5KeIN.html
03-05-2020||Mumbai||Absence of foul stench, change in water colour at Thane creek during lockdown: Study||Researchers have recorded an improvement in the water quality of Thane creek, including areas within the flamingo sanctuary, during the lockdown period.An absence of foul order and a change in the water colour were the main observations as industrial waste discharge was negligible but domestic sewage continued.This is the first water quality assessment for the Mumbai region during the lockdown, done by the Maharashtra forest department and Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) released on Saturday. “Areas along the creek that previously had water colour with dark black patches, due to industrial waste, had turned brown. Some portions of the creek even had clear water, and the foul stench, observed during sampling every month, was missing,” said Mrugank Prabhu, scientist, BNHS who led the study.Nathuram Kokare, range forest officer (Thane creek) said, “Bird numbers, including flamingos, have increased at deeper ends of the creek where they did not go before. This is also because fishing activities have completely stopped.”Samples were collected during high tide from 14 locations at the creek along a km-long stretch covering Vitava in Thane till Koparkhairne, Navi Mumbai on the east bank, and Kanjurmarg in Mumbai (part of the flamingo sanctuary) to Vitava on the west bank. Samples were compared with levels during January, February and March. The results (all average values) showed lowest turbidity levels (a measure of haziness in water caused by sediments and algae) in four months during April at 30.7 Formazin Nephelometric Unit (FNU), which ranged between 44.2 and 76.72 FNU in previous months.Deepak Apte, director, BNHS said, “Highly populated areas surrounding the creek drain effluents and sewage when there are no restrictions (like the lockdown). In this case, an industrial effluent reduction is visible but not domestic sewage. This is, however, a preliminary study and we need many more sampling exercises, the status of polluting sources, and impact on local biodiversity to conclude.”The most striking factor was a drastic rise in oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) - a measure the ability of a river or creek to cleanse itself or break down waste - during April. The parameter fell from 45.2 millivolts (mV) in February to 6.86 mV in March and shot up to 148.22 mV in April. “When the ORP value is high, there is a lot of oxygen present in the water. High ORP level means better water quality,” said Prabhu. As compared to the dissolved oxygen level (present in water) was marginally higher than in previous months.Independent researcher and member of the Mangrove Society of India Pramod Salaskar who was not part of the study said, “High ORP is indicative of healthy water quality with low toxicity of metals and contaminants. ORP should read as high as 300-500 mV for the best water quality. However, in this study, the level of dissolved oxygen does not compliment high ORP. We must investigate whether high ORP was caused by effluents as byproducts while producing sanitisers by industries,” he said.According to the mangrove cell, there are over 200 bird species (flamingos and waders being dominant) at Thane creek, which is also home to 68 insects, 29 butterflies and moths, nine mangrove species among other biodiversity. Owing to high water pollution, a Salim Ali Centre for Ornithology and Natural History (SACON) study had recorded a drop in fish species from 69 to just seven. In August 2016, the state had declared the northern part of the creek as a flamingo sanctuary spread across 1,690 hectares and proposed a 3.4 sq. km buffer zone around it last year. “The lockdown has allowed us to capture the background water quality levels if the industrial discharge is at its minimum. Based on this analysis and future studies, we will strategise on how to reduce overall water pollution once the lockdown is called off,” said Virendra Tiwari, additional principal chief conservator of forest (Mangrove cell).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/absence-of-foul-stench-change-in-water-colour-at-thane-creek-during-lockdown-study/story-gjIJ2bdHPnXvovIlGn3kJI.html

Mayor Naresh Mhaske said, “Around 80% people are following the lockdown norms. However, Covid cases are increasing because of the 20% who are still not following them. Apart from several other measures, the TMC is encouraging people to stay at home and follow lockdown norms. So, we have come up with the ward-level competition.”The month-long contest encourages residents to follow lockdown rules to be a winner. TMC has also announced ₹50 lakh and ₹25 lakh for wards which do not report a single case and all Covid positive patients are discharged. The contest period will be from May 2 to May 15, May 2 to May 29 and June 1 to June 14 and June 28 depending on the situation.A TMC official said, “The ward which has no positive case from May 1 to 14 and earlier patients recovered will be awarded ₹ 25 lakh while the ward which does not report a single positive case from May 1 to 28 will be awarded ₹50 lakh. The money will be used to improve the basic amenities in the ward.”Residents will have to apply on the Digithane application to take part in the contest.Residents of winning wards will also be given certificates as Covid fighters, while those who work towards preventing the spread will also be felicitated.Mhaske said, “The contest will be judged on how effective the lockdown is being followed. There will not be special teams to visit the wards but we will go through CCTV recordings and take police recommendations.”The contest will also judge on how people behave towards emergency workers. “The corporators and social activists of each ward will create awareness about the contest through social media, without venturing out of the house,” said Mhaske.The residents who have symptoms will have to give a self-declaration and visit the nearby fever clinic. If people hide their illness, wards will lose points.The contest also for individuals. People can take part in best home selfie contest, self-declaration of the disease contest, video contest for best safety practices of individuals and housing societies and new initiatives adopted to ensure safety. People in emergency services can also send a 30-second video of the safety practices they are following.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/follow-lockdown-win-a-prize-thane-civic-body/story-IlsZYzeUiDW2wwQ8mAgzPO.html

The snow leopard had in four attacks on livestock corralled in the village in the last two weeks killed around 43 sheep and goats. According to the villagers, three days back a livestock owner had walked into a shed at his farm where cattle, horses and sheep were kept and saw the leopard trapped there and sheep carcasses lying on the floor.Frightened he called other villagers to help and they later informed the civil authorities at Spiti after which additional district magistrate, Gian Sagar Negi, dispatched a team headed by the forest ranger to trap the leopard.The officials then trekked for four hours to reach the spot, fixed the wires of the enclosure to make sure the leopard remained trapped, and captured it.“The team adopted standard operation procedures to trap the leopard,” Negi said. Wildlife team members believe the same leopard killed 15 sheep on April 20; 12 sheep on April 29 and 11 goats on April 30.“It is evident that the snow leopard is not fit to prey in the wild and is looking for easy prey in the enclosures. Now that it has been rescued and there’s possibility of internal injury, so it’s not advisable to release it in its natural habitat without a medical checkup,” Negi added.The captured animal was later moved to the Rescue and Rehabilitation Centre, Shimla, in a pick-up van for medical examination before being quarantined.The state animal of Himachal Pradesh, the snow leopard can be found at altitudes of 9,800 to 17,000 feet in high and rugged terrains. It’s range spans the Kibber Wildlife Sanctuary in Lahaul and Spiti to Pangi in Chamba district. A survey done by the wildlife wing with the Nature Conservation Foundation of India covering parts of the animal’s habitat across HP revealed a population of 100 in the region. The animals had been spotted in seven areas, including Miyar, Thandi, Chandra and Bagha in the upper Spiti region of Lahaul and Spiti district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/snow-leopard-which-killed-43-sheep-goats-captured-in-lahaul-and-spiti-village/story-yw1QQ7JLPI8TIgW97PRaOP.html

03-05-2020||Mumbai||Now, an app that can remotely monitor Covid-19 patient’s heartbeat||A mobile application, developed by a startup incubated at the Indian Insititute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B), can remotely monitor heart and breathing rates of Covid-19 patients. This can help in reducing the burden on both the country’s medical infrastructure and the limited number of health workers amid the Covid-19 pandemic. The Vytal Health Tracker application, designed by startup Vytal, helps clinics and community workers track key health indicators of patients’, using their mobile phones. The application converts smartphones into mini medical devices by offering Photoplethysmographic (PPG) signal, using the smartphone’s in-built sensors. The PPG is a simple optical technique used to detect changes in blood volume.“The Vytal app offers PPG signals using the smartphone’s sensors in a non-invasive way. It doesn’t need external sensors and is independent of ambient lighting conditions. From this, the patient’s heart and breathing rates are estimated,” said Gunjan Jain, co-founder of Vytal, which was incubated at the Society for Innovation and Entrepreneurship at IIT-B. “Monitoring can continue from home or in the absence of expensive medical devices,” she added. Healthcare and community workers can track symptoms of users through a dashboard on the application that is available in English and Hindi. The tracker will also send an alert to doctors through text messages if a patient’s vital parameters breach the acceptable limits. In case of any signs of distress, the app also connects doctors with patients to provide video consultation. “The app minimises risks to health workers, offers continuous care, and can help individuals or patients in quarantine facilities and those under home quarantine,” said Jain. The startup is in talks with government and civic authorities on the application’s usage by frontline workers. A separate segment on the app takes care of mental and psychosocial well-being of such patients/ individuals through relaxing and meditative games. It also helps curb the spread of fake news by keeping people informed about Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/now-an-app-that-can-remotely-monitor-covid-19-patient-s-heartbeat/story-g0j90G2QAC4qihAA2xE5wJ.html

Gaikwad and other PMC officials visited hotspots in areas including Patil Estate, Kaamgaar putla, Tadiwala road and Laxmi Nagar in Yerawada.“During our interaction, several people demanded that swab collection centres be set up in their areas as it would be convenient for them,” Gaikwad said.Once their swabs were taken for coronavirus test, they could stay at nearby schools or marriage halls which the civic body has requisitioned and isolate themselves till the results arrives, people told the officials.The administration is also considering taking over civic schools and marriage halls to house those who await the test results for quarantine purpose. At present, first contacts of any positive person in the area are housed in Rakshaknagar, Kharadi, 15 km away.“The people who test negative come home a day after and those who test positive proceed to isolation facilities,” he said.But many people resist being shifted to an area which is away from their homes.“To make it convenient for people, we will think of setting up swab collection centre in their own areas and after the swab collection, they can be shifted to the nearest school or marriage hall for quarantiningprocess,” Gaikwad said.“Living near their homes will be comfortable for them,” he said. The civic body will also use 300 pulse oximeters to officials who are conducting screening in hotspot areas to identify severe Covid-19 cases. Pulse oximeter, measures the oxygen saturation of the patient’s blood, as it has been observed that Covid-19 patients tend to have lower blood oxygen levels. The test is not confirmatory but it can help detect people with low blood oxygen levels who can then be tested further for virus infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-municipal-corporation-mulls-swab-collection-centres-in-hotspots/story-ICie2NMhZ3AGn8mtB9metL.html

03-05-2020||Pune||On the frontline: My job is also to keep everyone motivated in the ward, says Dr Aarti Kinikar||Dr Aarti Kinikar, 56, is the head of the paediatric ward at Sassoon General Hospital. With Sassoon being a dedicated covid facility, she speaks to HT about how is she helping children in her ward to cope with Covid-19. Kinikar is also a professor at BJ Medical College.What exactly is your role in this crisis?I head the paediatric ward at Sassoon hospital where we have suspected cases. From the time we have moved to the new building, nine children have tested positive, the youngest being a four-month-old baby, who has recovered. Right now we have two positive cases in the ward. I have been with Sassoon hospital since 2000 and have also been a part of the services during the H1N1 pandemic, where I designed an indigenous ventilator for infants which is now patented. My work involves, seeing the patients and supervising 35 doctors working on a rotation basis.How does your day begin and rolls out? My day begins at 5.30am. I am also incharge of reporting as a nodal person for overseeing the covid activity in Sassoon. I have two resident doctors who first check every patient and gather information. They send it to another associate who combines it and sends the report to me. I read through the report and then this report is given to the dean, district collector and municipal authorities. At home, my husband and I maintain social distance by staying in two different rooms as he is also a paediatrician and we are both closely working with positive patients. My son is in Sweden studying. In our ward, nine babies were born to covid positive mothers, including a pair of twins, and a preterm infant of 1.4 kg. The problem is that all the family members are in quarantine and no one is willing to come as caretakers, thus our doctors, nurses take care of the babies. We also have a human milk bank.What precautions are you taking?I wear a mask at all times and PPE kit, goggles when coming in contact with a positive person. However, one must be happy at all times, eat well and drink a lot of water. I have to also keep everyone motivated at the ward.What is your assessment of the covid crisis in Pune? How is it unfolding?A lot of help has been pouring in from different organisations and collaborations with the civic department are helping too. The distribution of work between all departments including the police is commendable. Other hospital doctors especially intensivists, physicians and paediatric doctors are coming forward to help in the covid ward which is a big bonus.What gaps do you see in health and relief work?There is lack of awareness among public. Patients with co-morbidities must come forward early so as to be treated on time. All the hospitals in the city must start treating patients instead of referring everyone to Sassoon. There are hospitals identified for pregnant women, but are not yet functioning. Till now we have had 15 mothers in very short period and these could have been easily managed from wherever they were referred.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/on-the-frontline-my-job-is-also-to-keep-everyone-motivated-in-the-ward-says-dr-aarti-kinikar/story-EWjfFddVxTdn3Z37Uy9LaO.html

According to the guidelines by Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Covid-19 is a respiratory disease and the spread stops when the patient dies. The only safety measure that needs to be observed is to stay away from the viruses present on the body surface and secretions from nose, mouth,” the press note released by five doctors states.Dr Vinay Kulkarni (Prayas Health Group), Dr Anant Phadke, Dr Arun Gadre, Dr Sharda Bapat and Dr Shriram Geet, all from the Poona Citizen Doctor Forum, have issued detailed guidelines for relatives and healthcare workers. According to their guidelines, for healthcare workers, mortuary staff and others directly handling bodies, these standard precautions involve wearing protective gear like gloves and masks, maintaining good hand hygiene and sanitising everything that the body has touched. For family members, priests and mourners, they involve not touching the body, wearing basic protective gear, and not gathering in groups to pray.“Relatives attending the funeral must wear masks, wash hands, wear gloves, maintain six feet distance, shower when you get home and immerse your clothes in soap water. The virus cannot survive in the ashes after cremation or in the soil where the corpse is buried. Hence, there is no need to spray disinfectant on the ashes or the place of burial. The fear will eventually go away,” added Dr Kulkarni. Precautions taken by PMCDr Kalpana Baliwant from the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) health department said, “We are taking all the precautionary. There is no post-mortem, and the body is sprayed with disinfectants before being wrapped in cloth and then placed inside a zipped plastic bag. The entire procedure post declared dead, takes two hours.”PMC has also authorised two NGO’s to help in burying the dead as many of the relatives refuse to touch or even take the body. “With the numbers increasing, we have sought help of the NGO Muslim Popular Front of India and Mulniwasi Muslim Manch to help our staff in the designated burial grounds,” she added.

The data published by the Reserve Bank of India, on April 23, states that the Indian banking sector has deposits to the tune of Rs 145,00,000 crore and the share of Maharashtra alone in the said deposits is 22.8 per cent followed by Delhi (10 per cent), Uttar Pradesh (7.8 per cent), Karnataka (7.2 per cent) and Gujarat (5.4 per cent) as per the reserve requirements, every bank has to maintain SLR at 18 per cent of its deposits, in the form of G-sec.Through this G-sec the Central government receives funds to the tune of Rs 26,00,000 crore. Out of such funds Rs 5,95,000 crore is received from Maharashtra alone as against Gujarat’s contribution of Rs 1,40,000 crore, the letter read.Terming the Centre’s move as “shocking decision”, he said the Central government’s decision will be taken as an act of “undermining the strategic importance of Mumbai” that boasts as the nation’s financial capital and claimed even the financial institutions across the world will be taken aback.He urged the government to have a look at statistical information which confirms the former decision to set up the IFSC in Mumbai. “I request the Centre to reconsider the decision to shift IFSC in Gujarat and relocate it in Mumbai on merit basis and I expect the Prime Minister will take a “rational, judicious decision” keeping aside the state politics and consider it as an issue of utmost national importance,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/erroneous-unwarranted-pawar-on-centre-s-decision-to-set-up-ifsc-in-gujarat/story-Ahm03bkxHODrE5NODHoKuM.html

The other 15 cases were reported from across southeast district’s Tughlakabad Extension area.The government and civic agencies have been at work in the areas over the last two weeks to contain the spread of the virus after the first cases were detected there. The respective areas were also declared containment zones when the positive cases came to light. As of Saturday, Delhi has 95 containment zones.The two, however, are not the first clusters to report multiple Covid-19 cases. On April 23, at least 46 people had tested positive for Covid-19 from two lanes of an already-notified containment zone in Jahangirpuri.KapasheraAccording to district administration officials, a woman living in a building in Theke Wali Gali near the deputy commissioner’s office tested positive for the disease on April 18. Consequently, district administration sealed the densely populated building, which houses around 200 people, and declared the lane a containment zone on April 19.The building has now been become a Covid-19 hot spot.Southwest district magistrate Rahul Singh said that though the guidelines mandate sealing of an area when three cases have been reported, the district administration took the “proactive decision” to seal the building with only one case reported, to ensure the virus did not spread any further.Kapashera is also home to thousands of migrant workers who work in different parts of the national capital and share small single rooms with other workers.“We conducted a survey and collected samples of 175 residents of the building on April 20 and April 22. Of these samples, sent to the NIB laboratory in Noida, 67 returned on Friday evening, and 41 were positive. We expect the remaining test results to arrive in a couple of days,” Singh said.He said the test results were delayed due to pendency of cases at the Noida laboratory. “All the individuals who tested positive are asymptomatic, and fresh tests will be conducted to assess their present status,” he added.According to former councillor Anil Yadav, the building has entries in two lanes of the area. The front of the plot houses a two-storey building while the back has makeshift rooms. Yadav said there are 60-65 rooms in all. He said vigilance and sanitisation drives have been stepped up.Tughlakabad ExtnAs many as 15 residents of lanes 24 to 28, which were previously declared containment zones, of Tughlakabad Extension have tested positive for Covid-19.

03-05-2020||Kolkata||Bengal CM, guv spar over Covid figures||Amid a raging controversy over mismatch in the state’s data of Covid-19 infections, the West Bengal government on Saturday changed the format of its daily bulletin. The day also saw chief minister Mamata Banerjee sending a 13-page letter to Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar in response to his letters, accusing him of “dreaming of a dyarchy in the state”.Referring to the data discrepancy, Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar took to social media on Saturday to ask the state government to maintain transparency. “Give up ‘Covid-19 data cover up operation’ @MamataOfficial and share it transparently,” Dhankhar tweeted.Banerjee, in her letter, listed a series of phrases from the two letters that the governor wrote her, and said, “Such words and such communications of such content, tenor and tone from a Governor to an elected CM are unprecedented in the annals of Indian constitutional and political history.” Dhankhar was quick to respond on Twitter. “There are no sane takers for this unseemly scenario. I have held enough close to my chest -- looks like revealing is becoming unavoidable. Reply will be sent as her letter has content to which I cannot subscribe as it eclipses essence of Constitution,” he tweeted.The controversy over data mismatch was triggered by state health secretary Vivek Kumar’s letter to union health secretary Preeti Sudan on April 30, putting the total number of persons testing positive for Covid-19 in the state at 931. However, the figure given by the state during press briefings and in bulletins added up to 816.Even as the discrepancy snowballed into a raging political controversy by evening, the government skipped the press briefing altogether. Bulletins for May 1 and May 2 were published together at about 9 pm on Saturday. The state reported 127 new cases, 15 deaths and 60 recoveries. Neither chief secretary Rajiva Sinha nor health secretary Vivek Kumar responded to HT’s calls.

The gate was guarded by some volunteers, who were allowing a few workers at a time to walk inside the resort to collect the ration. When a huge crowd tried to enter forcibly, the volunteers lathi-charged them to keep the queues in order.Inspector Varunjit Singh, SHO, Moti Nagar station, said though the police were asking labourers to maintain adequate distance and avoid crowding, they were not heeding to the directions. On the hand, labourers said their patience grew thin as they had been waiting for three hours already, and they were eager to get their hands on the supplies as every visit to the resort in the past had been unfruitfulAjit of Saharanpur district in Uttar Pradesh, who lives in Moti Nagar, said this was his fourth visit to the venue. “I applied for ration on 1905 helpline number, and received a text message with the time, date and location to collect it. I was shocked to see the huge rush on arriving at the resort. On my each previous visit, the ration got over before my turn came,” he added.Another labourer Santosh of Banmankhi town in Bihar, said he worked in a small garment factory and his employer had not paid him since March 22, forcing his family to go without food. “It is difficult to survive for so long without money and food. When we are invited to collect ration, we have to stand in queues for several hours, and even then many return empty handed. Worse, police even thrash us,” he alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/long-queues-endless-wait-in-scorching-sun-for-hungry-labourers-in-ludhiana/story-uc9nGBhgzh9U13B30eWVRM.html

03-05-2020||City||Mumbai Police reach out to migrant workers||Following the relaxation of lockdown norms, the city police have started to visit food distribution points, community kitchens, relief camps and shelters to distribute registration forms to migrant workers, who are stranded owing to the lockdown, to enable them to travel back to their hometown.The ministry of home affairs on Friday allowed inter-state road transport for migrant workers, pilgrims and students after which the Indian Railways announced special ‘shramik trains’ for migrant workers.Mumbai Police officials said that most migrant workers come from poor background and can’t access the internet, which is why the top brass decided to reach out to them in person. According to a senior police officer, after the Bandra railway station chaos on April 14, after more than 1,000 labourers turned up on hearing rumours that train services would begin, they had identified the pockets where most stranded migrants and labourers live to provide them food and other essentials. The clusters are in Bandra and Wadala TT, along with the docks namely Sewri, Mazagaon, Reay Road, Cotton Green, Govandi, Mankhurd, Chembur, north Borivli and Kandivli.“Our men are distributing the form manually to reach out to maximum number of stranded migrant workers, pilgrims and students. Many migrants are given forms at the food distribution points, community kitchens and relief camps and shelters,” said Vinoy Kumar Choubey, additional director general (law and order), Mumbai Police.Public announcements are being made in slums to discourage migrant workers from rushing to police stations or railway stations with the forms. Only one member of a group is allowed to visit a police station with the required documents. “The forms are handed out with the instruction that they must avoid applying for a single person’s travel and instead form a group of 25 to 40 and apply together. They are also being told about the required documents such as health clearance certificate from a registered doctor, Aadhaar card details, etc.,” Choubey said. “Separate teams under zonal DCPs, the nodal officers for the task, will segregate the forms and arrange for the transport in coordination with the Railways and state road transport department. Once we get forms of around 1,000 stranded migrants wishing to go to the same destination, we will approach the railways to arrange a train for the said destination.”However, despite the announcement, migrant workers thronged police stations such as Nirmal Nagar, Vanrai, Dharavi, Nagpada to submit forms. Police officers at these stations had difficulty in making the applicants maintain social distance and manage the crowd. However, the police could not provide the data on the number of applications they have received so far.Migrants stranded in containment areas are not included in this set up, irrespective of their health conditions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-police-reach-out-to-migrant-workers/story-ciFkvRr5I5fOzyS6a6rKVO.html

Human disturbance had forced them only to move after sunset when there was complete silence, but this has changed completely since the last week of March,” said Samadhan Chavan, deputy conservator of forests, Sindhudurg.The forest department has set up awareness campaigns and elephant camps to aid local residents. “The movement of elephants during daytime increases chances of human-animal encounters apart from crop damage. Local volunteers and forest guards are keeping a watch on these developments and informing local authorities,” said Nitin Kakodkar, principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife), Maharashtra. According to the forest department’s estimate, the herd has damaged crops worth approximately ₹16 lakh during the lockdown. “We were paying an average of ₹10 lakh per month as compensation for the damage every night before the lockdown. Now, owing to their rapid movement during the day, the area of damage is likely to be twice as much. We are yet to collate the final estimate,” said Chavan.Three elephant camps have been set up in Heware, Bhekuli, and Sateli villages. “Each camp has five volunteers, some with prior experience as mahouts, and their job is to raise awareness among villagers, monitor conflict or crop damage, and elephant movement,” said Chavan.Between April 2019 and March 2020, the Sindhudurg forest department gave ₹1.2 crore as compensation to villagers for crop damage by wildlife (including elephants, bison, deer etc.). The figure was ₹1.04 crore during April 2018 to March 2019.“What is happening at Sindhudurg is truly unique for the state’s only elephant family,” said V Clement Ben, chief conservator of forest (Kolhapur). “From 2002 onwards, these pachyderms have dispersed from Karnataka to Sindhudurg in search of food and water resources. Transient movement of a few individuals across both states is regularly observed.” Overall, there are nine elephants in Maharashtra. One more tusker is located near the Tillari dam area, which is cordoned off using bamboo plantations, and the animal does not leave its habitat. There are three more (two tuskers and a female) present in the hilly terrain near Ghatkarwadi village at Ajara, Kolhapur district. “Elephants in the Kolhapur region are more isolated from each other since they are not a family. They mostly stay inside the forest and come out at night,” said Ben. The 38-km long Dodamarg wildlife corridor that connects Radhanagari Wildlife Sanctuary in Maharashtra to Bhimgad Wildlife Sanctuary in Karnataka frequently witnesses elephant and tiger movement.AT SINDHUDURG: 74% TURTLE HATCHLING SURVIVAL RATEAccording to the forest department, the total number of Olive Ridley turtle nests between January and April was 59 in Vengurla, Malvan, and Devgad talukas, with 6,409 eggs and 4,767 hatchlings safely making their way to the sea. This year’s survival rate of 74.3% is higher than that of 2017 and 2019. In Vengurla, 38 nests were recorded in seven villages, with 4,237 eggs and 3,204 hatchlings making their way into the sea (survival rate: 75.6%). At Malvan, 10 nests in two villages had 1,055 eggs and 758 hatchlings (survival rate: 72%). At one village in Devgad, 11 nests had 1,117 eggs and 805 hatchlings (survival rate: 72%). “Between 2017 and 2019, the number eggs may have been more but the hatchlings that made it successfully to sea did not cross 4,300. This year due to less disturbance during the lockdown, the survival rate is better,” said Samadhan Chavan, deputy conservator of forests, Sindhudurg.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-locked-down-elephant-family-steps-out/story-W8MXBVaxoBJjBRmlUvh7xJ.html

The city, which had crossed the 4,000-mark on April 23, doubled its count to 8,000 in nine days. As cases continue to mount in Mumbai, Thane, Palghar, Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad, Malegaon, the state government, which issued guidelines for extension of lockdown on Saturday, imposed restrictions in most on these areas.With the third phase of the nation-wide lockdown starting from Monday, the state government has issued relaxation in varying degrees across Maharashtra’s red, orange and green zones to gradually allow businesses and individuals to resume normal lives. In a detailed order, the state government has outlined activities permitted and prohibited in the red, orange, and green zones.The guidelines also stipulated that individuals engaged in non-essential activity shall not move out between 7pm and 7am; and the elderly, those with comorbidities, pregnant women and young children would stay home.

Besides these districts, Pune, Nashik, Nagpur, Solapur and Aurangabad districts are also in the red zones. Yavatmal, Satara, Dhule, Akola and Jalgaon are also in the red zone, but would see fewer restrictions as against the hotpot areas in Mumbai, Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), Pune, Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR) and Malegaon in Nashik district.In the red zone — which is defined by taking into account total active cases, doubling rate, etc, — autorickshaws, cycle rickshaws, taxi, cab aggregators, intra-district and inter-district of plying of buses, barber shops, and salons will not be permitted.The municipal areas of Mumbai, Thane, Palghar, Pune, Malegaon and Pimpri Chinchwad have got several restrictions, including the opening of shops, private offices, and government offices.All standalone shops, neighbourhood shops, and shops in residential complexes — without any distinction between essential and non-essential — can also function, except those in the municipal corporation areas of MMR, Malegaon Municipal Corporation, Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC). The order makes a mention opening of liquor shops in the annexure, but it has not been clarified whether these shops will open across zones. A senior state government official said that the stores would permitted to open in orange and green zones, with strict compliance of social distancing.E-commerce will, however, be confined to essential goods. Private offices can also now function, up to 33% of their strength, except in MMR, PMC, PCMC and Malegaon.

These 16 districts are in the orange zone, where activities barred in red zone would be permitted.Maharashtra has six districts in the green zone. Gadchiroli and Wardha have no Covid-19 patients, while Gondia has not reported any new case in the past 35 days. Osmanabad has three cases, while Sindhudurg and Washim have two cases each. In the green zone, buses can operate with 50% capacity. However, buses will not be allowed to ply outside the zone.Meanwhile, Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope announced that all citizens will be covered under the Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Arogya Yojana (MJPJAY), the state government’s health scheme. Tope said that Maharashtra will be the first state to provide free and cashless insurance protection to its people. The health department officials said from now on, the state government, semi-government employees and white ration card holders, which were earlier excluded from availing the scheme, will be able to apply for this scheme.Tope said, “Earlier, 85% people were covered under the MJPJAY, now the remaining 15% have also been brought under the scheme. Now everybody can avail the scheme if they get admitted to the 1,000 empanelled hospitals for nearly 1,000 ailment packages. They would get cashless treatment for Covid and non-Covid treatments.”Meanwhile, migrant labourers from shelter camps in Nashik district were sent to Uttar Pradesh by the special ‘Shramik’ train. According to Nashik collector’s office, 847 stranded migrant labourers were sent back to Lucknow. These workers walked from Mumbai, Thane and other areas to reach their villages in the northern state. They were housed in shelter camps after all state borders were sealed after the lockdown was imposed. Guardian minister of Nashik district, Chhagan Bhujbal, flagged off the train on Saturday. A special outstation train with nearly 1,200 migrant workers left from Bhiwandi Road station on Saturday night. The train will operate between Bhiwandi and Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh and will not halt at any railway station. A second special train is also likely to depart for Gorakhpur on Sunday late evening. The train is likely to be operated from Vasai Road railway station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maha-sees-highest-one-day-toll-of-36-crosses-500-mark/story-KWEzHqWUHlHdbrwaDVY2FK.html
03-05-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh curfew to be lifted at Sunday midnight||The Chandigarh administration on Saturday decided to lift the curfew imposed to contain the Covid-19 spread from Sunday midnight and allow opening of sector markets, government and private offices, resumption of industrial activities and movement of vehicles from Monday morning. These will, however, be implemented under an odd-even formula and subject to certain restrictions.Besides this relief coming after 40 days, the whole city will not remain a containment zone and these will be restricted to the six Covid-19 affected pockets, including parts of hotspots Bapu Dham Colony and Sector 30, where no relaxations will be granted.Making the announcement, UT adviser Manoj Parida said even as the lockdown was extended for 15 days, relaxations had been given in consonance with the Central guidelines on red zones as the city remained in that category.“UT, however, has given additional relaxations like new odd-even formula for vehicular movement and general trade based on the feedback from different residential groups,” he said.Parida said the relaxations will not be applicable to contained pockets where UT administrator VP Singh Badnore stressed on the need for continuous and extensive testing of all suspected cases. In a statement on Saturday, Badnore also appealed to the citizens to maintain social distancing and warned that areas in which norms were being violated would be declared containment zones again. ODD-EVEN NEW EXPERIMENTThe odd-even formula will be applicable to shops as well as vehicles, Parida said. From Monday, even numbers for vehicles and shops will be allowed. This will continue on rotation every week. “We may review it if there are some practical issues related to implementation,” Parida said. However these restrictions are not applicable on emergency and government vehicles besides shops providing essential goods.The idea is to have fewer vehicles on city roads and people have been requested to carpool with others till further relaxations are allowed.Personal vehicles of government employees will also be not exempt from rules, Parida added, saying no inter-state pass was required for travel to Chandigarh from 7am to 7pm, but odd-even formula was applicable.Shops will also not be closed on Sunday, he added, with the odd-even scheme also applicable to those operating from residential buildings and commercial areas in rural areas and colonies. TRADERS SATISFIED, INDUSTRIALISTS NEED CLARIFICATIONThe traders were satisfied with the decision to open the shops on odd-even basis, Chandigarh Beopar Mandal chairman Charanjiv Singh said. However, the timings from 7am to 7pm were too long. “I appeal to traders to abide by the guidelines for their own safety,” he added.Pankaj Khanna, president, Industrial Association of Chandigarh, wanted detailed instructions on opening of industries in the city.“We have a lot of doubts about the kind of industry that can be opened up under the home affairs ministry’s red zone guidelines, for which we want the administration to release separate instructions. A workforce of more than 30,000 is involved in Chandigarh’s industrial areas and is waiting for long for some industrial revival,” he said.Hitesh Puri, president, Chandigarh Residents’ Association Welfare Federation , said the step was welcome but the focus of the people and the administration in fighting Covid-19 should not be diluted. Strict action was required against those who violated the restrictions, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-curfew-to-be-lifted-at-sunday-midnight/story-QVI0UN5i8a6NTgmnoNJURO.html

Shande was patrolling at Behrampada slum area, a containment zone, when he spotted Shaikh loitering in the neighbourhood with his cart. When Shande asked him to go back home, he told Shande that he was distributing vegetables to residents. This lead to an altercation between the duo and later turned into a scuffle. Soon, the other residents intervened and sided with Shaikh, following which the latter had to resort to mild lathi charge. Shashikant Bhandare, senior inspector of Nirmal Nagar police station, said, “We have sent him for a Covid-19 test as he stays in a containment zone, and have not arrested him yet.” In the second incident, a Kurla resident was booked for manhandling a PSI from Kurla police station around 6.30pm. Kakasaheb Nagave, 35, and his team were conducting a march on Kurla pipe road. The accused, Rizwan Memon, a resident of Wafati Lane building, began shouting at the police. “He asked us not to shut any shop on the pipe road and threatened to use his contacts in the National Investigation Agency against us. This led to an altercation, after which he manhandled the PSI and a constable. Some residents crowded the area and Memon managed to escape,” said Dattarey Shinde, senior inspector, Kurla station. In the third incident, constable Suhas Desai, 50, was allegedly assaulted by a 41-year-old autorickshaw driver, Yar Mohammad Kalim Shaha, when the latter was questioned for loitering around at Govandi, around 6.30pm. The accused had also pelted a stone at the police. 2 testing centres for mumbai policeOn Friday, the Mumbai Police started two testing centres for its personnel. The centre inside JJ Hospital premises has been opened for personnel in south, central and eastern suburbs, while the one at Jogeshwari has been opened at a private school near the eastern side of the station for the police personnel at western and northern region.

03-05-2020||Mumbai||Fadnavis defends Centre over setting up of IFSC HQ at Gandhinagar||Former chief minister and Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis on Saturday defended the Central government’s move to set up International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) headquarters at Gandhinagar and said it was unfair to blame Prime Minister Narendra Modi for this. He was referring to allegation by state revenue minister and Congress leader Balasaheb Thorat that the move was undertaken to reduce the importance of Mumbai as the financial capital of the country. Fadnavis also claimed that the previous state government, during his tenure, had submitted a proposal to the Centre to allow functioning of two IFSCs in the country – in Mumbai and Gujarat – and added that it was still under consideration. In his tweet, Fadnavis recalled the history of IFSC saying it was the then Congress-Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) government which is to be blamed for this as it did not consider the option when it first came up in 2007. “A high-powered committee of the Central government submitted a report in February 2007, recommending creation of IFSC. Neither did the government of Maharashtra submit any official proposal, nor did the Centre consider it,” said Fadnavis. He further credited PM Modi, then chief minister of Gujarat, for offering Ahmedabad for setting up IFSC in 2007, following which work for the same started in 2012.“The headquarters is announced at Gandhinagar because it is the only functional IFSC. Those who are beating the chest now were in power from 2007 to 2014 and did nothing for Mumbai IFSC,” he said. Fadnavis said Mumbai has a natural ecosystem and can still become an IFSC if the state government so desired.Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant said, “It is not a secret that PM Modi has always wanted to bring Gujarat ahead of all other states and that he does not look at all states equally. But, the Fadnavis government also mislead people for five years by claiming that an IFSC would be built in Mumbai.’’||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/fadnavis-defends-centre-over-setting-up-of-ifsc-hq-at-gandhinagar/story-qxR4fJIQjAoIbbqOddpfoL.html

The court also refused to grant pre-arrest bail to Gurman Singh Hothi and Daljit Singh, two other directors of the bank.Special public prosecutor Ajay Missar confirmed the order and said the court while rejecting the pleas of the accused held that prime facie the case is established by the prosecution against the accused. Missar also said the court considered that the case involved huge amount of public money and that the investigation is still in progress.The directors whose bail pleas have been rejected along with Singh and Arora are Jagdish Mookhey, Mukti Bavisi, Ranjit Tara Singh and Tripti Bane. The directors had, in their separate pleas, said they had no role to play in the fraud. Singh and Arora too claimed they had nothing to do with the fraud. The prosecution had opposed the bail plea and argued that the directors and former chairmen of the bank were responsible for the fraud.While the court rejected the anticipatory bail plea of Hothi and Daljit, it extended the interim protection of the duo till June 15 to allow them time to approach the Bombay high court (HC).According to the prosecution, PMC Bank granted loans to realty group Housing Development Infrastructure Limited (HDIL) without following due process. The principle loan amount of ₹2,400 crore snowballed into ₹6,670 crore because HDIL failed to repay multiple loans between 2008 and 2019. Senior management of PMC Bank covered up these irregularities to avoid scrutiny by the Reserve Bank of India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/pmc-bank-fraud-court-refuses-bail-to-eight-bank-directors/story-EUWfCGTOJvGP9lWk37TCFI.html
03-05-2020||Chandigarh||Institutional isolation answer to lack of social distancing in Chandigarh’s hotspot Bapu Dham Colony, suggest experts||With five new Covid-19 cases being reported from one of the city’s oldest colonies of Bapu Dham on Saturday, the area now accounts for 45% of the total positive cases in Chandigarh.Even as the administration is putting in place measures to contain the spread, experts have suggested that the “institutional isolation model” that was recommended for Dharavi in Mumbai by an inter-ministerial central team (IMCT) could work here.Area councillor Dalip Sharma said more than 50,000 people reside in 2,500 multi-storey houses here. On an average a family of five live in one room and over 20 people occupy a 25-yard small house here. Social distancing—a must to contain the spread of coronavirus—is, therefore, practically impossible to be achieved here.A central government official who oversaw the visit of the IMCT, unauthorised to speak to the media, said when there are 70-80% infected asymptomatic persons in every state, the disease will spread exponentially if you leave people in close proximity in a congested place like Dharavi.“The IMCT has emphasised that since there is negligible social distancing, the Dharavi dwellers should be taken out and placed in institutional isolation. Since they have to use community toilets, they can’t be stopped from going out either.’’ the official said.For arresting the spread in Chandigarh’s Bapu Dham Colony, the central official said the district administration can shift the residents to a government school, an indoor stadium or a building with toilet facilities.Dr KK Talwar, former director, PGIMER, said: “If the virus has spread in the community, first you contain them there, then you do testing of all those who have flu-like symptoms.”“You let the young stay there, but because the elderly are most vulnerable, they along with those suffering from chronic illnesses should be taken out of these congested colonies and placed safely in institutes, where adequate arrangements are ensured,” he added.A research on institutional isolation published by Lancet in April suggested that the approach was successfully implemented in Wuhan. Though the research primarily focused on those who tested positive for Covid-19, the study said the results show the need for institution-based isolation to reduce household and community transmission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/institutional-isolation-answer-to-lack-of-social-distancing-in-chandigarh-s-hotspot-bapu-dham-colony-suggest-experts/story-QrX4TElpJWxJvdAWTA2L0L.html

We are indebted to them for life,” she said. Professor Jagat Ram, director PGIMER, said that with the new discharge, the number of patients cured at PGIMER is now 13. Such moments help us tide over the toughest of challenges of our job.”He added, however, that at times even the best efforts do not result in positive outcomes. “It was disheartening when another female patient, aged 63, from Haryana succumbed to the virus. She was suffering chronic renal disease too. Although dialysis was also done but she could not be saved,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/another-chandigarh-woman-recovers-discharged-from-pgimer-s-covid-ward/story-GqO3adcNQF8PJCco7RaaLO.html

However, with a number of recoveries, including five on Saturday, and two deaths in Mohali so far, the active cases are 75, 57 and one, respectively. Of the six cases reported in Chandigarh on Saturday, five are from the congested Bapu Dham Colony in Sector 26, which now accounts for 45% of the city’s Covid-19 infections with 42 cases, and one is from Manimajra — A 49-year-old man from Shastri Nagar, who is a family contact of an already diagnosed positive case.In Bapu Dham Colony, the chain of transmission was first detected when a 30-year-old operation theatre attendant of Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, who resides in the area, tested positive last Friday. The fresh cases include a 14-year-old boy, three men, aged 34, 39 and 42, and a 21-year-old woman, all residents of the colony’s Phase 1.Meanwhile, a 59-year-old woman from Sector 30 was discharged from the PGIMER after she was found to be negative for Covid-19, taking the total number of recovered patients to 19 in Chandigarh. Her son, daughter-in-law and 11-month-old granddaughter have already been cured.In Mohali, a 27-year-old woman from Desumajra in Kharar tested positive for Covid-19 in Mohali district on Saturday, taking the district count to 93.The woman stays with her husband on rent in Desumajra village. Hailing from Himachal Pradesh, she had returned to Kharar on March 1 and was looking for job. Her husband is working in a factory in Mohali. “She had not been keeping well and thus had visited the Kharar civil hospital. Her samples were collected at the flu corner set up in the hospital as she was displaying flu-like symptoms,” said civil surgeon Dr Manjit Singh, adding that the woman has been shifted to Gian Sagar Hospital in Banur.Of the total 93 Covid-19 cases reported from the district, 57 are active. While 34 have been cured, including a PGIMER employee from Nayagaon among four people discharged on Saturday, two have died.

03-05-2020||City||Kharar flyover work picks up speed amid curfew, likely to meet September deadline||The restrictions on movement owing to the coronavirus curfew have come as a blessing in disguise for the Chandigarh-Kharar flyover as the work is back on track, with authorities hoping the project will finally be completed by September.Since work resumed on April 20, around 300 persons have been employed at the site and 200 truckloads of fly ash are being used daily to build ramps at the entry and exit points of the flyover. The potholes have been filled and the work on service lanes is being done.However, getting the work back on track was a challenge owing to shortage of labour and delays in permission to move machines to site. The construction activity comes to a halt in the night because of inadequate workforce. Officials of the district administration said the company has applied for permission to get back labour from Uttar Pradesh, and once that is done the work will gain momentum.Project director of National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) KL Sachdeva said, “The work is in full swing and we are taking all necessary precautions for the safety of the labour at work. With not much movement of traffic, the work has picked pace.” The employees are wearing masks, gloves and maintaining social distance, he added.The work had come to a standstill on March 22 after the nationwide lockdown was announced. Even though the work resumed later, the shifting of overhead high-tension power cables to be undertaken by the Punjab State Transmission Corporation Limited (PSTCL) is yet to happen.NEW DEADLINES TO COMPLETE WORK IN PHASED MANNER“We have reviewed the progress of the construction. Going by the present pace, I have been assured that the service lanes will be completed by May end,” said Himanshu Jain, sub-divisional magistrate (SDM), Kharar.Jain said, “The new Khanpur bridge will come up by July end and the NHAI will demolish the old one soon. After this, the entry and exit points would be constructed.” THE PROJECTThe 10-km Kharar-Chandigarh road expansion project that entails construction of two flyovers and three bridges and the authorities is struggling to meet the fifth deadline of the project. The new deadline is September 2020.The NHAI had handed over the ₹368-crore project to Larsen & Toubro (L&T) and the construction began in November 2015. It was to be completed by December 2018. However, in the past four years only 68% work was completed.Delays were on account of shifting the start point of the flyover from Dara Studio to Balongi due to agitation by locals in June 2016, issues of land acquisition, disbursement of compensation, demolition of critical structures and limitations of traffic diversion in the area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kharar-flyover-work-picks-up-speed-amid-curfew-likely-to-meet-september-deadline/story-Oiz4HwVDoD1B4JfZXnKYxO.html

The BMC had planned to complete work on 45 spots before monsoon and leave the work remaining 24 spots for later.However, a senior civic official said, “Since lockdown started in March, we were not able to complete ongoing work on all 45 waterlogging spots. Work on some of the spots apart from the 24 spots will remain incomplete for this monsoon. Ongoing work will be brought to a safe status before the monsoon if it cannot be completed.” At the beginning of the lockdown, there was no availability of labourers and work was halted, the officer said.Meanwhile, the BMC has started desilting over 280 nullahs in the city and cleaning of underground stormwater drains. As work was not progressing in the first month of the lockdown, most crucial spots like the Mithi river and its adjoining roads and low lying areas have now been chosen to prevent waterlogging.BMC is working on laying a 240-metre long and 1.8-metre wide stormwater drain from Kalanagar in Bandra to Mithi. This will give relief to residents of Bandra (East) and Kalanagar areas. Flood gates are also being installed where Mithi meets the sea to ensure water does not flow inward at the time of high tide during rains. Nullahs leading to Mithi river are being desilted on priority, the officer said.An officer from the stormwater drains department said, “Most of the labourers needed to complete the work before May 30 have been brought back by contractors. We plan to wrap up the on-going work by May 25, and keep a buffer of five days.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/pre-monsoon-work-delayed-city-may-see-waterlogging-at-35-spots/story-YdYZH1ypp6vbIKr88tgkZO.html
03-05-2020||Lucknow||UP govt draws corona protection plan for migrants||The Uttar Pradesh health department has prepared an elaborate plan to protect migrants from the Covid-19 infection, quarantine them and provide treatment to those among them who test positive for the coronavirus.The move comes at a time when the Uttar Pradesh government has launched an exercise to bring back over one million migrant workers.Besides, the state government has decided to increase one lakh beds in isolation wards and quarantine facilities in view of the arrival of the migrants.Principal secretary, health and family welfare, Amit Mohan Prasad on Saturday said the migrants’ samples will be pool tested and the testing of samples will be increased. All the district magistrates and divisional commissioners were directed to implement the plan for the migrants, he said.The Uttar Pradesh government has already told the governments of states from where the migrants are coming back to conduct their screening or medical test before they board trains/ buses for Uttar Pradesh.The respective state governments would hand over a list of the screened migrants to nodal officers of UP, the senior officer said. Once the migrants arrive at the bus station or the railway stations in UP, health teams will screen them again, he said.If migrant workers are infected with coronavirus, they will be admitted in isolation wards of Covid hospitals established by the state government in various districts.Those having symptoms of the disease will be admitted in quarantine facilities. After seven days’ quarantine, their sample will be sent for tests. If the test result is negative, they will be sent for 14 days’ home quarantine. Those without symptoms will be put in 21 days’ home quarantine in their respective villages or towns, Prasad said.On Sunday, around 1,000 migrants are expected to arrive at the Lucknow railway station by a special train from Nashik in Maharashtra. The state government plans to bring more migrants by train from Maharashtra and Gujarat. The government has also decided to bring back migrant workers from Uttarakhand and Rajasthan by bus. Besides, 5,259 migrants from neighbouring Madhya Pradesh and 12,000 from Haryana were brought back, Prasad said.The state government has decided to prepare a data base of migrant workers. Their names, addresses, mobile numbers and Aadhaar numbers will be collected by the respective district administrations. The database will be forwarded to the relief commissioner’s office. The labour department will also prepare a list of the skilled and unskilled migrants. The migrants who have no home quarantine facility will be kept in institutional quarantine, he said.A village surveillance committee headed by the gram pradhan will monitor the migrants. The Asha (accredited social health activists), anganbari workers, and volunteers of Yuvak Mangal Dal will be members of the committee. In urban areas, the ward councilor will head the surveillance committee. Asha workers, civil defence members and representatives of Residents’ Welfare Association will be the members of this committee there.Asha workers will visit the homes of migrant workers and tell their family members about the Covid protocol during the home quarantine, including social distancing, wearing masks and regular handwashing.Outsiders will not be permitted to enter the house of a quarantined migrant. Only one member of a migrant’s family will be allowed to go outdoors to procure essential commodities. Senior citizens, children and pregnant women will be directed to maintain a safe distance from the migrant, he said.A notice will be pasted on the door of the migrant’s house with date of the quarantine. The Arogya Setu app will be downloaded on the smartphones of migrants and Asha workers will pay home visits thrice a week to check whether they have Covid symptoms.The infected patients will be admitted in hospital. If any migrant violates quarantine guidelines, he will be shifted to the institutional quarantine facility run by the district administration, the principal secretary said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-govt-draws-corona-protection-plan-for-migrants/story-cpOANnAsQtfL9eWaT5eNQM.html

03-05-2020||Chandigarh||Fight Covid-19 with 30 minutes of laughter every day||With the lockdown extending for two more weeks starting from May 4, mental health issues related to anxiety and uneasiness are further going to engulf people. In the current scenario, where the world is yet to find a permanent solution to the Covid-19, boosting immune system remains the tried-and-tested method to fight the pandemic. With the world celebrating ‘Laughter day’ on May 3, it is going to be a perfect Sunday to start with the laughter exercises. Even without stepping out of house and while staying within the confines of the homes, people can boost their immunity by doing laughter yoga for 15 to 30 minutes.The laughter exercise or laughter yoga is not very technical, but easy to perform. One has to simply laugh and continue doing it. Clapping and some body movements can be included in the daily dose of laughter exercise routine.“In the current scenario everyone should work on boosting the immune system and laughter is a great therapy. It can do wonders in strengthening the immune system. Laughter yoga boosts our immune cells and infection fighting antibodies. 15 minutes of laughing exercises in a day is equivalent to 30 minutes of cardio exercises done thrice in a week. Besides, 10 minutes of belly laughter (loud unrestrained laugh) is equivalent to half-an-hour of cardio exercises. 10 minutes of hearty laughter is equal to 30 minutes on the rowing machine,” says laughter yoga expert Nidhi Jaswal, who is a technical coordinator at the department of community medicine and school of public health at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh.Initially, if one is a little hesitant about laughing because of the loud sound, the person can go for silent laughter as an alternative. “Have you ever laughed so hard that no sound actually came out? Practice laughing without any sound and gradually pick up the loud laughter,” says Jaswal.INCREASES LUNGS CAPACITYLaughter is a good for the respiratory system as it open lungs. “Laughter yoga increases the lung capacity by ensuring controlled and forced breathing. It further increases the ventilation of 30% of alveolus (air sacs in lungs), which are usually not functioning in normal breathing,” says Dr Sonu Goel, a professor at the department of community medicine and school of public health, PGIMER. “Health experts are trying to explore natural and effective ways to improve the ability to fight the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2. India has been a proponent of yoga and ayurveda since ages to boost immunity and increase power to fight diseases. The ancient Indian practices have a lot to offer to persons who are struggling with co-morbid conditions and are desperately seeking ways to improve their immunity. Laughter exercises can be an alternative to yoga to boost immunity,” adds Dr Sonu Goel.LAUGHTER REDUCES STRESSAs deduced various medical researchers, stress is the number one killer and more than 70-80% of illnesses are due to stress. Laughter yoga is a single exercise routine that reduces physical, mental and emotional stress simultaneously and brings an emotional balance.“Laughter yoga has the power to change your mood within minutes by releasing certain chemicals from your brain called endorphins. If your mood is good, you feel good within and will remain cheerful throughout the day. The health benefits of laughter come in two categories: For people who are not sick and want to stay healthy and secondly, for those who have some illness, laughter yoga helps to heal faster,” says Dr Rakesh Gupta, president and director public health, Strategic Institute of Public Health and Research, Chandigarh. “Laughter is also a powerful antidote for depression, reduces blood pressure, reduces symptoms of allergies, asthma, arthritis and helps in chronic illnesses like cancer,” he says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/fight-covid-19-with-30-minutes-of-laughter-every-day/story-OTVGrVacfdo4urgm8HFfHM.html

While robberies and kidnappings are down by 100 percent in City Beautiful, petty thefts continue and smuggling of liquor is thriving even during the outbreak.According to police crime statistics of April 2020, no incident of kidnapping, sexual harassment, stalking or robbery was reported. In April last year, 15 cases of kidnapping, six cases of sexual harassment and two cases of stalking and robbery were reported.With people spending all their time at home, thieves are finding it hard to break into houses, said police, and are instead targeting vehicles parked outside houses or on streets.Although theft of two-wheelers has gone down by 75 percent, some pockets in the city are reporting a few thefts. However, no cars, SUV’s, jeeps and other four-wheelers or three wheelers were reported stolen this month.Senior superintendent of police(SSP) Nilambari Jagadale said “Crime will keep declining but we are anticipating a rise in motor-vehicle thefts as the movement of vehicles increases, following new orders. Parking spaces might become vulnerable so we are increasing patrolling around them.”Besides, other petty thefts, too, are down by 68 percent and burglaries at night have decreased by 45 percent in April as compared to last year. But police said they are still receiving complaint of petty thefts.Snatching cases down by 75% As per trend of the last three years, there has always been a spurt in snatching cases in March and April. But this year, only five cases were reported in April, as compared to last year when 20 cases were reported. 94 percent decline in rapeOnly one case of rape was reported to the police in April this year, as compared to 17 last year, police said. Even dowry cases are down by 77 percent. Police say although few cases of domestic violence and dowry have been reported, these numbers could be artificially low as victims may not be able to report abuse in the presence of their abusers.55% spike in liquor smugglingAs per police records, this April saw a surge in cases of liquor smuggling. As many as 17 FIRs were registered under the Excise Act alone, as compared to 11 last year in April. Locals said the business of liquor smuggling is thriving in Chandigarh with the patronage of local police. “In our village, several people were selling illicit liquor despite the government’s ban on its sale. No action was taken against them as they had full support of police,” said a resident of Hallomajra, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/curfew-leaves-thieves-twiddling-thumbs-liquor-smuggling-up-by-55-this-april-in-chandigarh/story-ALuQ12vq0yE9kFhO6VQ9pJ.html

Three-fourths of the Covid positive patients — 1712 —were from the hotspots, he said.Health teams surveyed 45.35 lakh people and 7.86 lakh houses in the hotspots. Around 18,000 people suspected to be infected with coronavirus were residing in the hotspots, he said, adding the health department had put 8,000 people in home quarantine.The police have set up 3,000 barriers around hotspots, penalised 20,000 people for violating hotspot guidelines, seized 1,500 vehicles and registered FIRs against 2,000 people.RETAIL VEGETABLE, FRUIT MARKETS TO BE ALLOWED FROM 7AM-7PMLUCKNOW : The state government decided to extend the time slot for retail vegetable and fruit markets in order to avoid overcrowding, additional chief secretary, home, Awanish Kumar Awasthi said on Saturday.Orders were issued to district magistrates to allow retail vegetable and fruit markets to remain open from 7am to 7pm daily, Awasthi said.The DMs have been also directed to sanitize the wholesale and retail markets and deploy PRD jawans to manage crowd.It had been observed that large crowds gathered in the mandis in violation of social distancing protocols due to the short span of their functioning, he said.The wholesale vegetable and fruit markets open at 4am in all the districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/yogi-sets-four-day-deadline-for-ventilators-in-20-dists/story-Y6AD3lolu2IQnbOcaaw3rL.html

03-05-2020||Noida||Protocol, dedication, team work: What helped a small Gzb CHC achieve 84% Covid recovery rate||A small 30-bed Community Health Centre (CHC) in Muradnagar, which had only cared for general OPD patients from different rural areas of Ghaizabad till March 25, now has the rare distinction of discharging 84% of its Covid-19 patients, with none requiring special care. Since it started functioning as an L1 category Covid hospital in the last week of March, the CHC has successfully treated 27 of 32 patients admitted so far. All the patients, who were discharged upon full recovery, were stable and none had to be shifted to an L2 or L3 Covid facility, said doctors at the facility, which is manned by two teams of 25 each, including six doctors, six nurses, six cleaning staff, two lab technicians, three ward boys and two pharmacists. “This recovery rate would not been possible without the dedication, team work and sacrifice of the staff. Minute precautions and all safety and health protocols have to be followed. Every staff member adapted. Finally, it is not about whether we have small infrastructure but it is more about our will which motivates us to do what we are doing today,” said hospital superintendent Dr GP Mathuria, who is leading the Covid-19 teams, and is a resident of Delhi but has been staying in the CHC campus, which has four flats for doctors and 28 for non-officer level staff.Detailing the training the teams got—how to wear and safely remove PPE kits; basics of infection prevention; information about the disease; prevention and patient management—Dr Davi Lal, the physician of the first Covid-19 team at the CHC, said that not only was the staff trained before the facility was opened for Covid-19 patients, some infrastructure changes were also made to the facility as per protocol. “All 30 beds were rearranged. Twelve were spread out on the ground floor, 16 on 1st floor and two in another room to ensure a 1.5-metre distance is maintained. The main entrance was restricted only for staff and the rear entrance was reserved for movement of patients. We switched off all ACs and all department rooms were shut. Ten CCTVs were installed and separate biomedical waste room was created for disposal of used PPE kits, masks etc,” said Dr Davi Lal, who was part of the team that initially got trained in protocols and later trained the staff. “It is because of team efforts that none of our Covid-19 positive patients were ever needed to be referred to a higher facility. This is the biggest achievement our team from small CHC has till date,” the doctor added.“I have not met my 8-year-old son for over one month, ever since I left him at my mother’s house in Patla near Niwari; my husband is an Indian army and is posted in Jammu,” Parul Naresh, one of the staff nurse at the CHC, said, adding that during the initial training we were told that we will be staying away from family members as we perform duties in a highly contaminated zone. “I speak to my son only through mobile phone and I last saw my husband on Holi. Initially, I was afraid of dealing with Covid-19 patients but sensed that they too were afraid about the virus. After 2-3 days, the fear melted away and our entire team joined hands to treat patients,” she said.The CHC so far has dealt with Covid-19 positive patients linked to the Delhi religious congregation, Noida based company Ceasefire and others who came from Indirapuram, Vasundhara, Sahibabad etc.Basanti Pujan, another staff nurse who is a part of the Covid team, said that though her family lives in the staff quarters in the same CHC campus, she has not met her children for over one month now. “I left my 3-year-old son and 14-year-old daughter with my husband. I know the Coronavirus situation will last a long time and I may have to stay away from my children, but duty comes first,” she said. After the first team completed its 15 days on duty, all members were sent to passive quarantine and the second team took over. A third team of another set of 25 members is set to join a few days.“At CHC, they normally perform small surgeries and deliveries and treating seasonal diseases on routine basis. But the doctors and staff have performed well during Covid duties and treated about 70% Covid-19 symptomatic patients from Ghaziabad. We now have another L1 attached hospital at ESI Hosptial, Sahibabad. It will also start functioning as L1 category hospital,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/protocol-dedication-team-work-what-helped-a-small-gzb-chc-achieve-84-covid-recovery-rate/story-qSjyBJFlocYqZKdEzNLSgP.html
03-05-2020||Delhi||First breather for Delhi: Govt to allow relaxations for red zones||The Delhi government will allow all relaxations listed by the Union ministry of home affairs for areas in the ‘red zones’, health minister Satyendar Jain said on Saturday, in a first curtailment of lockdown rules in the national capital since April 20 when the AAP government had refused to allow lowering the bar for containing Covid-19. In addition, the government on Saturday also started identifying standalone liquor shops that could be opened with social distancing norms.On April 20, the Delhi government had refused any relaxation which was otherwise allowed by the Central government from April 20. It was only almost a week later that it allowed opening of standalone shops and operation of self-employed electricians, plumbers and water purifier repairmen.A state-specific order on the fresh lockdown rules, including the additional activities that will be permitted, will be issued by the Delhi government on Sunday. A “limited” lockdown which includes suspension of air, train and inter-state road travel will continue to remain in force for two more weeks from May 4 across the country, but some activities would be allowed after classifications of districts into red, orange and green zones based on Covid-19 risk profiling, the Centre had announced on Friday.Zone classification breatherDelhi health minister Satyendar Jain said all 11 districts in Delhi will be in the red zone till May 17. However, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal requested the Centre on Saturday to demarcate red, orange and green zones on the basis of containment zones and not districts. Officials explained that the Union health ministry designates any area as red, orange or green zone on district level. Delhi has only 11 districts and it is geographically different to other states. Once the ward-level categorisation plan is ready, it will be sent to the ministry for its approval. If it gets approved, Delhi, which is entirely in the red zone, will have orange and green zones as well, they said.Till Saturday, the national capital had recorded 4,122 cases of coronavirus and 64 fatalities. On Saturday, 384 new cases were reported. With no new containment zone being identified on Saturday, the total number of such zones in Delhi was 95. As per the MHA order, none of the relaxations would be applicable to the containment zones.Operation of public transport, taxi services, autorickshaws, barbershops, spas and salons are also explicitly prohibited in the red zones.Liquor shopsOn Saturday, the government also began identifying standalone liquor shops that could be opened with social distancing norms. Liquor is a major revenue earner and sale of liquor had been suspended during the operation of the lockdown till May 3. “The Centre has laid its guidelines for the entire country on the basis of districts and not containment zones. All the 11 districts of Delhi are in the red zone. So, whatever activities have been permitted by the Centre, the Delhi government will implement them in the city in toto,” said Satyendar Jain, who holds health and home portfolios.A senior government official said not all liquor vends will be allowed to open. Firstly, they will have to be standalone liquor shops (not part of any market, shopping complex or mall) or those located in neighbourhoods or residential colonies. Secondly, only the stores having L6 and L8 licenses will be permitted. L6 license for retail vend of Indian liquor/beer is granted only to selected undertakings of the Delhi government such as DTTDC, DSIDC, DSCSC and DCCWS. L8 licenses are given to retail vends selling country liquor.“The number of such shops (with L6 and L8 licences) is more than 500, but that number is not important as not all will be eligible to open because it has to be a standalone shop. So, we have asked our teams to identify such standalone liquor shops across the city,” an official in the excise department said.A second senior government official said the usual revenue mop up for April is around Rs 3,500 crore. But, this year the government could collect only over Rs 320 crore in April. “If such a situation persists then paying salaries to Delhi government employees could also become tougher,” the official said on condition of anonymity.Movement of peopleAs per the MHA rules, individuals and vehicles (with a maximum of three occupants in cars and one occupant on two-wheelers) will be allowed. Private offices can operate with 33% staff strength physically present on the premises and the rest working from home, the order states. All government officials, of deputy secretary rank and higher, can function with 100% staff, while 33% staff strength is allowed for other ranks.Hospital and testing centre for govt officialsDelhi chief secretary Vijay Dev on Saturday appointed a state nodal welfare officer to provide “all necessary help”, including medical treatment and welfare, to Covid-19 positive officers of the Delhi government, its autonomous bodies, corporations and local bodies (municipal corporations).The order came in the wake of doctors, nurses of Delhi government hospitals, and civil defence volunteers in the south-west district office testing positive for Covid-19.While Nikhil Kumar, the CEO of Delhi Jal Board has been appointed as the nodal officer, he has been tasked with identifying two dedicated hospitals and one exclusive testing centre for Delhi government officers and their families.“A staff welfare cell and a dedicated 24x7 helpline number under this cell will be opened for regular interaction with infected officers as well as their family members. The district magistrates have been asked to provide details of officers found Covid-19 positive in their districts daily to the state nodal welfare officer,” a senior government official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/first-breather-for-delhi-govt-to-allow-relaxations-for-red-zones/story-wTZrZvYuMPWUb6JdpbijLJ.html
03-05-2020||Mumbai||Maha’s 1st plasma therapy trial: Covid-positive man was treated on compassionate grounds, says doctor||A senior doctor closely involved in Maharashtra’s first trial for convalescent plasma therapy for Covid-19 treatment told HT on Saturday that the patient did not meet the inclusion criteria mentioned in the protocol. “Instead,” he said, “the patient was allowed to be treated on compassionate grounds, and as the last resort.” The 53-year-old male patient died on April 30, five days after the plasma transfusion.Convalescent plasma therapy involves injecting patients with plasma from recovered patients. The plasma, which would have developed antibodies to fight invading viruses (in this case, the coronavirus), theoretically boosts a patient’s immunity response to Sars-CoV-2. A patient needs to meet required parameters such as adequate oxygen flow in the body, normal pulse rate and a lack of co-morbid health issues to qualify for the therapy.In this case, however, the patient was in critical condition. Doctors in the city feel that convalescent plasma therapy needs to be used in patients that are in better condition.The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), under infectious disease expert Dr Om Srivastava, started the clinical therapy at Kasturba Gandhi Hospital after receiving an approval from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). BYL Nair Hospital extracted the plasma from a recovered patient, which was later sent to Lilavati Hospital for the clinical therapy. The 53-year-old patient from Kurla had tested positive on April 19 and was admitted to Lilavati Hospital on April 20. As his condition was critical, he was put on ventilator support in the hospital’s intensive care unit (ICU). His diagnosis revealed that he had developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with pneumonia. The man developed Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) after which the team headed by Dr Om Srivastava gave the approval, the doctor said. CRS is a form of systemic inflammatory response syndrome when the immune system attacks the organs in the body.“He didn’t meet the inclusion criteria, but approval was given on grounds of compassion,” said the doctor.On April 25, a 200ml of plasma was transfused into the patient, after which the oxygen intake improved, but he soon went into shock. He developed a bacterial infection that did not respond to antibiotics. He died on April 30.Lilavati Hospital said the patient was brought in a critical condition. He was given anti-viral medicines, but he didn’t respond, hospital authorities said. “We kept him on immunosuppressants, but they didn’t have much effect. We wanted to give him another 400ml of plasma, but his condition deteriorated to such an extent that we couldn’t. We tried our best to save him, but his condition was very critical,” said Lilavati Hospital CEO Dr V Ravishankar.BMC commissioner Praveen Pardeshi was reportedly informed that the patient could either improve or succumb to the underlying infection. He was also informed that if the patient dies, it would be considered a failure of the plasma therapy and generate inappropriate reactions. Pardeshi could not be reached for a comment. Talking to HT, the patient’s son said, “They told us that it was the only way to save my father as medicines were ineffective.”This comes in the backdrop of Lav Agarwal, joint secretary, Union health and family welfare ministry, saying convalescent plasma therapy is not an approved way to treat Covid-19 patients. Medical experts, however, say it should be used only for patients whose condition is better.“The antibodies may neutralise the Sars-CoV-2, but the underlying inflammation will kill the patient,” said Dr Lancelot Pinto, an epidemiologist from Hinduja Hospital. “It is important to run the therapy among patients with a better chance of survival to understand if plasma therapy is effective. It is a study [in this case], but a proven treatment [otherwise], which can be used to save lives.”Meanwhile, Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC, said, “Six more cured patients have donated their blood. Once we get a suitable patient, we will conduct the second trial. Seven Hills hospital has got a patient for plasma transfusion.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-positive-man-wasn-t-fit-for-plasma-therapy-said-senior-doctor/story-mdeJKpSAjGZVUPWtpgJ8RO.html
03-05-2020||Chandigarh||65% private schools in Chandigarh refuse to pay salaries to employees for April||Of 77 private schools in Chandigarh, over 50 schools said that they will not be paying salaries to employees for April. The Independent Schools Association (ISA), a body of private schools in Chandigarh, said that if the UT education department doesn’t allow schools to collect fee soon, salaries of teachers and Class 4 employees will be not be paid.ISA chairman HS Mamik told the Hindustan Times that the association will be approaching the Punjab and Haryana high court next week if no respite is given to schools by the education department. “Out of all the member schools, only 5 to 7 schools will be able to pay the salaries while the rest of the schools do not have sufficient funds to give salaries, said the chairman. “In my school itself, the budget for salaries is around ₹1 crore per month. Other member schools have to pay a minimum of 50-60 lakh as salary, he said while questioning, “How will they pay it unless they get fee from students?” He further said, “It is important that the fee should be paid by May 10 or latest by May 12 to sustain the schools. It is through the fee paid by the students that the employees get their salaries and the financial obligation is met.”As a matter of fact, around 12,000 teachers are employed in private schools in Chandigarh and the overall education industry is worth crores.The education department had deferred payment of tuition fee for the 2020-21 session in government and private schools owing to lockdown due to the coronavirus outbreak. The order said that the dates for fee collection will be announced after the schools reopen and a month’s time will be given for the payment.After repeated complaints regarding fees collection by various city schools, the education department had asked all private unaided schools to display their balance sheet online by March 30. However, none of the schools complied with the directions. Explanation calls were also made to over 15 schools by the education department.Chandigarh Parents’ Association president Nitin Goyal said, “If balance sheets of any school reveal that the school management is short of funds for paying the salaries of the staff, those particular schools should be allowed to charge a reduced fee to be able to cover the salaries of teachers and other employees only. Parents should not be burdened with the fat salaries of the top management and trustees as they are already very well-off and secured financially, Goyal added.UT director of school education Rubinderjit Singh Brar said, “The department is reconsidering the fee collection directive. A call in this regard will be taken by the senior authorities on Monday.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/65-private-schools-in-chandigarh-refuse-to-pay-salaries-to-employees-for-april/story-aScYCsxtcADrd4yj6ERQAP.html
03-05-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab eases curfew hours in orange, green zones||ChandigarhThe Punjab government on Saturday changed the curfew timings. The shops in green and orange zones will now remain open from 9am to 1pm from Sunday. Earlier, shops were allowed to open between 7am to 11am. There would be, however, no relaxations in red and containment zones. The decision to change the timings has been taken in response to requests from people in various districts to open the shops after 9am. The issue also came up for discussion during the cabinet meeting and there was consensus that the timings should be changed in public interest, said an official spokesperson.Continuing with his policy of “relief with strictness”, Amarinder made it clear that anyone found venturing out of their homes for essentials etc without wearing a mask would be strictly dealt with.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-eases-curfew-hours-in-orange-green-zones/story-6yWRaAngUsgYOAQ0tQ09PM.html
03-05-2020||Mumbai||8,220 industries start operations, 16,726 units to join them soon||More than 8,220 industry units with a workforce of over 1.63 lakh have started operations after the government announced relaxations for the industry on April 20, amid the lockdown, said the state industries department.According to department officials, the remaining 16,726 units with a workforce of over 3 lakh, which have got permission, are also expected to start in the next couple of days. “Before April 20, almost 14,781 units with a workforce of 3.5 lakh were already operational,” said an official.While the officials claim that the response from industry has been good, representatives from within the industry said that many of the conditions imposed by the government are impractical and are creating hurdles in restarting the operations. They have now sought relaxations of conditions including transportation of workers and their stay at the workplace.A nationwide survey conducted by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) recently also indicated that permits for enterprises pass for workers and supply chain movement are the key hurdles for the industry to exit from lockdown.“For facilitating restart of economic activities, CII has suggested that in non-containment zones, businesses should be allowed to function without requirement of permits and only through intimation to local authorities. Moreover, workers can be permitted to commute based on a letter issued by the employer organisation, with the facility to travel on their vehicles,” said Chandrajit Banerjee, director-general, CII.Venugopal Reddy, secretary, industries department said that they are taking all the steps very cautiously. “We have received 24,946 applications since April 20 from units which have agreed to fulfil all the conditions imposed by the state government. Of them, 8,220 units with over 1.63 lakh workers have started their operation. They have also got permission for over 2,000 vehicles for transportation of labourers,” Reddy said.JSW, Ceat, KEC International, POSCO Steel, Sudarshan Chemicals, Ambuja Cement, UltraTech, Uttam Galva Steels, Golden Fibres, Hindustan Unilever are some of the prominent industry units,which have started operations so far.There are a total of 2,430 large-scale units in the state while micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) units stand at 7,33,010.Chandrakant Salunkhe, president, Maharashtra Industrial and Economic Development Association (MIEDA) said they are facing multiple issues. “First of all, the workers are not available. Some are not coming out of fear while some are thinking if they get paid without work then why should they report to work. The other problem is the non-availability of raw material. The government needs to understand the supply chain required for the industrial sector will not work with the opening of only a few segments. There has to be proper planning, else industries will collapse if the lockdown is extended,” Salunkhe said.Kiran Paturkar, president, Federation of Industries Association, Vidarbha ,said with no work for more than a month, owners are not in a position to arrange transport and accommodation for workers, especially those linked to small-scale industries. “There has to be some mechanism to ensure that workers can be transported to the units, especially for small scale units. How will they invest in transport costs if there is no work for more than a month? Forcing workers to stay at the workplace or giving accommodation nearby is also not feasible,” Paturkar said.“Barring Mumbai Metropolitan Region and Pune Metropolitan Region, dedicated buses for transportation of workers have started in many areas with the help of Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC), a state-run corporation. The district administration, based on their discretion and assessment of the situation, is also allowing workers to commute on two-wheelers to where the industries are located in rural areas. The workers are residing close by, but in a controlled manner, the industries secretary said.“We have already suggested that the state government allow opening of all the industries without many conditions in green zones. However, the government is yet to take a decision,” said a senior official from the state industries department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/8-220-industries-start-ops-16-726-units-to-join-them-soon/story-ove8zvHmiHvUJ6Zdi1YRWO.html
03-05-2020||Chandigarh||Out of the box and into the frying pan||Difficult times and desperate situations are a perfect breeding ground for out-of-the-box suggestions. Success may not be guaranteed, but the excitement generated by such suggestions is worth the effort. Covid-19 has created unprecedented uncertainty across the globe. Even as the number of infected patients and fatalities rises globally, brainstorming to tackle the virus and life to return to normalcy assumes high priority. Scientists across the world are trying to piece together the jigsaw puzzle amidst numerous out-of-the box suggestions put forth by those who have no expertise on the matter – the latest one suggesting that a disinfectant be injected in the human body to kill the virus takes the cake.This takes me back to my days in the Army and the perils of out-of-the-box thinking. Years ago, the general officer commanding (GOC) was scheduled to visit our unit. The criticality of the first visit by this no-nonsense boss was lost on no one, in line with the age old dictum, ‘first impression is the last impression’. Now, there was a tricky problem here. The unit, even the neighboring area housing other units, had a number of stray dogs. Generous feeding by our God-fearing troops, despite orders to the contrary, had the canine population multiply in recent times. The commanding officer (CO) was in a dilemma, wondering how to escort the GOC around the unit lines with our four-legged friends merrily making hay.Having failed to find a solution after a couple of brainstorming sessions with the senior lot, the second-in-command suggested a chat with the young officers to get some innovative ideas. Various suggestions came up. Sandy, the young captain, too came to life and said, “Sir, we shall organise a food fair for our dog population at a secluded corner behind the alpha squadron cookhouse. All of them will gorge on their favorite food and thus remain confined to one spot while the GOC takes a round of the unit lines.” There was silence before the CO exclaimed in utter glee, “So it shall happen... Proud of you, my boy!”Everybody, of course, concurred and Sandy was the hero, having guaranteed himself a full 60 days of annual leave and a definite fillip to his career.Well, the day arrived and it was confirmed to the Tiger that the plan was in place and the unit was spick and span and canine free. The GOC arrived and after the mandatory operational briefing, the CO proudly offered him a tour around the unit area. However, the moment the open jeep with the VIP driven by the beaming CO turned the corner, a cavalcade of stray dogs of all sizes and shapes blocked the advance of the inspecting team. An obviously shaken CO was quick to rise to the occasion, a hallmark of a seasoned soldier, and with a matter-of-fact, say-it-all smile, stopped the jeep to let the column of animals pass. The smile directed towards the general meant, “ Sir, the unit respects animal rights as much as human rights.”The GOC, confronted with an awkward situation, could do nothing but respond: “Colonel, hope sterilisation norms are being followed with these poor things?”The unflappable demeanour of the CO, though, saved the day for the unit but had young Sandy marching up to the second in command. After a five-minute dressing down, he was asked if he wanted to say something in his defence.Sandy’s reply was: “Sir, the plan was perfect, only if the cook had not used aromatic spices. Also, mother nature controlled the wind direction, which forced the dogs, even those from the neighbouring units, to make a beeline for the food fair,” a response more convincing than the one presented after the disinfectant ingestion faux pas. Meanwhile, presence of mind exhibited by Sandy made him a favourite of the boss in all future brainstorming sessions for his out-of-the box thinking.avnishrms59@gmail.com (The writer is a Chandigarh-based freelance contributor)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/out-of-the-box-and-into-the-frying-pan/story-CeMIzrMnGfBskzyeX4ahvN.html
03-05-2020||Mumbai||BYL Nair Hospital faces medical staff shortage||The biggest Covid-19 facility in the city, BYL Nair Hospital, is facing a severe shortage of staff as its resident doctors are being transferred on coronavirus duty to other hospitals and facilities. Presently, the hospital has a bed capacity of 362, including 38 in the intensive care unit (ICU). With all beds occupied, resident doctors are working round the clock. Despite this, 140 resident doctors have been called on Covid-19 duty at the Seven Hills Hospital, 30 to Kasturba Gandhi Hospital and another 90 have been stationed under the public health department.“All Covid and non-covid hospitals are referring their patients to us for treatment. But rather than providing us with additional hands, our doctors are being taken away,” said a student from the hospital.Dr Mohan Joshi, current in-charge of the hospital said, “We have enough staff to cater to 1,000 patients. There is no additional pressure. They are working in different shifts. Also, the order to station doctors at other hospitals comes from the BMC.”Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) plans to extend the bed capacity at the hospital to 800. But arranging for the required number of staff will turn into the biggest hurdle. As the elderly are more susceptible to the infection, many senior doctors can’t get directly involved in the treatment of patients. This has put additional pressure on residents and already many of them have contracted the infection on duty. “Already, 40 medical staffers from the hospital have contracted the infection through cross-transmission. Many are also already quarantined so can’t even ask them to work,” said another doctor.The hospital also doesn’t have an adequate number of dialysis machines. As per sources, the hospital has only five dialysis machines which can only attend to 24 patients maximum daily. Whereas, the hospital has already registered 39 dialysis patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/nair-covid-hospital-faces-medical-staff-shortage/story-AdF1QQPe33jBFD5T9claiK.html
03-05-2020||Delhi||With hospitals overwhelmed, pregnant women left with no care or place to give birth||Last week, a 35-year-old woman from north-east Delhi’s Janta Mazdoor Colony started frantically calling the ASHA (accredited social health activist) when her labour pains started. When she couldn’t through to any worker, she went to the maternity clinic where her antenatal check-up had been done, but that was closed for the day when she got there.She was told to go to Kasturba hospital, about 6km away. “She did not know how to get there and she was already in a lot of pain. So, she decided to call a midwife home. She gave birth to a baby boy, who died soon after,” said Sulekha Singh, a health activist, who helped the woman take her baby to Chacha Nehru Bal Chikitsalay afterwards.Pregnant women, especially those about to give birth, are the worst hit by the ongoing lockdown as well as overwhelmed health care systems. With health care workers in several hospitals testing positive for the Covid-19, many women are no longer able to visit the hospitals that provided them antenatal care. While some are forced to travel to far-off hospitals, and brave the risk of a coronavirus infection, others have no option but to birth at home. Three days ago, a woman from Jahangirpuri did not know where to go when she thought she was having labour pains because the hospital she used to go to – Babu Jagjivan Ram Memorial Hospital – was closed after 75 health care workers tested positive for Covid-19.The police helped her reach Deep Chand Bandhu hospital where she was told there was still time for her to go into labour and was asked to go home. “Doctors from Deep Chand Bandhu hospital asked her to go to Ambedkar hospital for the delivery, which is closer to her place. But, we had not taken her there earlier as the gynaecology department was closed a day ago because someone had tested positive for Covid-19. The situation keeps changing daily and we have no idea where to take the women,” Singh said.One of the city’s biggest maternity centre -- Kasturba hospital near Jama Masjid – does not allow in patients from containment zones with fever, cough or sore throat.“There are several containment areas around the hospital, but if anyone from these areas comes to us with even a mild fever or sore throat, we do not admit them because they are likely to have Covid-19. We refer them to Covid-19 hospitals,” a doctor from the hospital, on condition of anonymity, said.This problem was highlighted when a 25-year-old woman from Nizamuddin Basti – which was declared a containment area after 2,300 Tablighi Jamaat members were evacuated from the Markaz complex -- was turned away from Safdarjung. She was referred to Lok Nayak hospital, which denied her admission because she was not Covid-19 positive. She visited at least six hospitals and maternity clinics in the span of 48 hours before finally giving birth outside All India Institute of Medical Sciences.This case was referred to in a public interest litigation by an organisation called SAMA in the Delhi high court. Responding to the plea, the Delhi high court had ordered, “The Union of India and the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi shall work in tandem to make sure that no barriers are faced by pregnant ladies and their family members residing in hot spots during the lockdown.” The busiest gynaecology department in Delhi, at Safdarjung hospital, which sees about 110 deliveries a day, is now creating a separate space for Covid-19 positive deliveries in the super specialty block where it houses other people with Covid-19.“For now, our labour rooms have been divided into non-Covid and suspected Covid. But, yes, women have been facing problems since the lockdown. Many smaller nursing homes and maternity hospitals are not functioning now. Also, earlier, the bigger hospitals used to accommodate more than one patient on each bed. That is not possible now, because we have to follow social distancing norms,” a doctor from Safdarjung hospital’s gynaecology department said.That is the reason why doctors at Lal Bahadur Shastri hospital in Khichripur say that there has been a surge in the number of maternity cases at the hospital ever since the lockdown, especially in the last two weeks.“We usually used to get 20-odd maternity cases daily. But now we are getting about 30-40 cases daily. We have got some maternity cases that were earlier undergoing routine checkups at big hospitals,” a senior doctor, on condition of anonymity, said.However, all this flies in the face of Delhi government orders. It has directed all clinics, hospitals and nursing homes, including private ones, to remain open for the treatment of non-Covid patients. The hospitals have been threatened with cancellation of licence if not complying with the order.Hospitals have been asked not to refuse treatment to anyone and ensure pregnancy deliveries, haemodialysis, blood transfusion, chemotherapy, treatment of chronic as well as communicable diseases, such as TB and leprosy.With inputs from Risha Chitlangia||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/with-hospitals-overwhelmed-pregnant-women-left-with-no-care-or-place-to-give-birth/story-iqOmJLgWn4TyXwx719O8vM.html

The migrants will have to register themselves on the portal, or they can call on helpline 1950 or call centre number 1100, said a government spokesperson.According to officials, to facilitate interstate movement (inward and outward) of stranded people, a web page -- https://edisha.gov.in/eForms/MigrantService -- has been launched for online registration of the migrant workers.Sharing more details about the same, the spokesperson said that in order to register a request for interstate movement, the migrants have to register themselves on the web page. If anyone wants to register through mobile application, then he/ she will have to download ‘Jan Sahayak Help me’ application from Google Playstore and provide all necessary information, the officials said.Besides, if any migrant worker does not have access to the above two and is stuck in Haryana, he/she may take assistance from the district administration by dialling 1950 or call centre number 1100.According to preliminary estimates, lakhs of migrant workers are stuck in the state due to the nationwide lockdown imposed to contain the Covid-19 spread, the officials said.Earlier in the day, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar appealed to the migrant labourers to remain in the state and not return to their native villages as several industries are going to resume operations in coming days. “All helps will be given to workers and their jobs will remain secure. We will also provide food and other essential items in case of any problem,” said Khattar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/haryana-launches-online-portal-to-facilitate-return-of-migrant-workers/story-cJ5Bklh1c8qZhxrNuVP8HO.html

03-05-2020||Gurugram||Visits to public places in Haryana declined by 91% in April, shows Google data||Mobility data published by Google shows that the ongoing lockdown, to curb the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19), has been effective in keeping at least a portion of India’s population indoors. In Haryana, for example, visits to parks and other public spaces declined by 91% between March 15 and April 26, as opposed to visits made between January 3 and February 6 (which has been taken as the baseline period). The data, which only captures smartphone users who have allowed Google to track their location history, also shows that movement to residential areas in the state increased by 22% after the outbreak. Google’s Community Mobility Reports, launched in early April to depict changing mobility trends in a post-Covid world, published a state-wise mobility data for India on Friday. The data shows a significant drop in the number of trips people made to recreational and work-related destinations, such as parks, grocery stores, pharmacies, transit stations and offices, while visits to residential locations increased.In Haryana, the data also shows an 86% decline in visits to restaurants, cafes, shopping centres, theme parks, museums, libraries, and movie theatres. During the same period, movement to transit stations, including metro stations and bus stands, declined by 70%. Visits to food markets, grocery stores and pharmacies declined by 46%, while visits to works places dropped by 42%, showed the data. Nationwide, the data shows an 86% reduction in trips to recreational destinations, 51% to grocery stores and pharmacies, 68% to parks, 66% to transit stations and 41% to workplaces, along with a 22% increase in trips to residential areas. Experts said this is not surprising, given strict curbs on movement imposed by the lockdown and the absence of pubic transport. “We have heard from public health officials that this same type of aggregated, anonymised data could be helpful as they make critical decisions to combat Covid-19,” Google had said in a statement at the time of launching it’s mobility data in early April. “This dataset is intended to help remediate the impact of COVID-19. It shouldn’t be used for medical diagnostic, prognostic, or treatment purposes. It also isn’t intended to be used for guidance on personal travel plans,” the report for India states.Experts said that while the data can be valuable for policy makers, it must also be viewed with certain caveats. Divij Joshi, lawyer and policy expert at an international not-for-profit technology company, said, “Such kind of data could be used by authorities to see how and where people are moving. This could help them understand where social distancing measures need to be enforced more strictly, for example. But the actual utility of the data is still to be seen. Also, Google has captured only those individuals who own smartphones and have allowed Google to track their location history.”Citizens using feature phones without internet connectivity have been left out of the data. “There is a large section of the population whose mobility patterns are not being noted, even though they are changing. Smartphone penetration in India is only between 30 to 40%, so Google’s data set covers only a certain section of the population, with most smartphone users living in urban areas,” Joshi added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/visits-to-public-places-in-haryana-declined-by-91-in-april-shows-google-data/story-Sg7FpXhe5DTthDHb0tWFSL.html
03-05-2020||Delhi||56 test positive in two clusters in Delhi, DMs call for retests after week-long delay||Fifty-six people, including a three-year-old, from two clusters in Kapashera and Tughlakabad Extension have tested positive for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in two days, according to the Delhi government. Forty-one cases were reported from a double-storey building in southwest Delhi’s Kapashera. The other 15 cases were reported from across southeast district’s Tughlakabad Extension area.Until Saturday evening, Delhi reported 4,122 Covid-19 cases, of whom 64 had died.The government and civic agencies have been at work in the areas over the last two weeks to contain the spread of the virus after the first cases were detected there. The respective areas were also declared containment zones when the positive cases came to light. As of Saturday, Delhi has 95 containment zones.Residents of areas categorised as containment zones are not allowed to step out of their houses, and authorities deliver essential items to doorsteps. Entries and exits to and from these neighbourhood are restricted as well, and pickets are continuously guarded by police personnel.The authorities allow only select vendors to supply groceries and other essentials to the neighbourhood with the help of local residents’ welfare associations.The two, however, are not the first clusters to report multiple Covid-19 cases. On April 23, at least 46 people had tested positive for Covid-19 from two lanes of an already-notified containment zone in Jahangirpuri area of north district.Kapashera According to district administration officials, a woman living in a building in Theke Wali Gali near the deputy commissioner’s office in Kapashera tested positive for the disease on April 18. Consequently, the district administration sealed the densely populated building, which houses around 200 people, and declared the lane a containment zone on April 19. The building has now been become a Covid-19 hot spot.Southwest district magistrate Rahul Singh said that though the guidelines mandate sealing of an area when three cases have been reported, the district administration took the “proactive decision” to seal the building with only one case reported, to ensure the virus did not spread any further. Kapashera is also home to thousands of migrant workers who work in different parts of the national capital and share small single rooms in the area, with other workers.“We conducted a survey and collected samples of 175 residents of the building on April 20 and April 22. Of these samples, sent to the National Institute of Biologicals (NIB) laboratory in Noida, 67 returned on Friday evening, and 41 were positive. We expect the remaining test results to arrive in a couple of days,” Singh said.He said the test results were delayed due to the pendency of cases at the Noida laboratory. “All the individuals who tested positive are asymptomatic, and fresh tests will be conducted to assess their present status,” he added.The 41 who tested positive are across age groups.According to former councillor Anil Yadav, the building has entries in two lanes of the area. The front of the plot houses a two-storey building, while the back has makeshift rooms. Yadav said there are 60-65 rooms in the building, including the makeshift ones.Some of the building’s residents had returned to their hometowns before the lockdown.“Most of the residents of the building are daily wage labourers, factory workers and fruit or vegetable vendors. The building is densely populated, with as many as four or five people living in one room. It’s good that the building was sealed on April 19, else the entire region could have been affected,” he said.He said vigilance and sanitisation drives have been stepped up in the area.Tughlakabad ExtensionAs many as 15 residents of lanes 24 to 28, which were previously declared containment zones, of Tughlakabad Extension have tested positive for Covid-19. The tests were conducted on April 20 and the results returned on April 30 evening. These tests were also sent to the NIB lab in Noida.Government officials said, 40 more results from the area were pending.Lanes 26 and 27 of Tughlakabad Extension were declared a containment zone on April 17, after three people tested positive. On April 19, 35 more people tested positive from the same area, after which three more lanes — 24, 25 and 28 — were added to the containment zone.District administration officials said that during a door-to-door survey in the area, some people displayed symptoms of the disease, after which 87 residents were tested. “Test reports of 47 people have arrived, of which 15 have tested positive,” an official said.Administration officials said they had ramped up surveillance in all the lanes, and that the area had been sealed completely. Poonam Bhati, councillor, Tughlakabad Extension, said disinfection exercises have been stepped up in the area and regular screenings are being conducted. She, however, said tests to should be conducted again since the initial reports had been delayed by more than a week.“More samples should be collected from the area. Report of another 40 samples are yet to come. There should be no delay, and reports should be released in stipulated timeframe of 36 to 48 hours for effective monitoring and treatment,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/56-test-positive-in-two-clusters-in-delhi-dms-call-for-retests-after-week-long-delay/story-a07xPmJy7Wa4eA6sKimepM.html
03-05-2020||Gurugram||Over 100 executives of private companies stopped at the border||More than 100 mid-level and senior executives of private companies were not allowed to enter Gurugram by the city police at the border on Saturday.A number of executives said that they were from the finance department and salary section of the human resources department and were on their way to process salaries. They also said that they had valid permissions from the government but they could not furnish supporting documents to be allowed to enter the city, said the police.Karan Goel, the assistant commissioner of police (ACP), deployed at the Sirhaul border, said that they cannot allow anyone unless they have a fresh permission and an emergency. “These people should apply for permission on the SARAL portal or ask the labour commissioner to issue directions so that they can cross the border to process the salaries within two days,” he said.More than 100 such executives were turned away from the border on Saturday since, as per the existing directions, salary does not fall under an emergency criteria, said police officials deployed at the border.Dhirender Singh, a senior HR executive of a private company in Udyog Vihar, said he could not cross the border on Friday as all the previous passes were cancelled and their fresh applications were not considered. Further, we have not received any response from the district administration till now. “We need to transfer salaries by Monday as people need to pay their rent, school fees for their children and meet other expenditure. Our company has always paid by the second of every month but due to this pandemic and borders being sealed, the process has been delayed,” he said.Another senior executive of a private company in Cyber City said they need to process all the salaries and check the deductions before preparing the final amount to be paid. “Its been more than a month that we have not been to office and many of us are working from home. We need to visit our office premises and update some balance sheets to release the salaries of the employees. The district administration needs to take this seriously as this is no less than an emergency,” said Rashmi Kapoor, a senior HR executive.Amit Khatri, Gurugram deputy commissioner, said they are issuing passes for all kinds of emergencies and the companies should be very specific while entering details on SARAl portal. “We are trying to resolve all issues related to emergencies,” he said.Despite repeated calls and messages to Munesh Sharma, assistant labour commissioner, he did not respond.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/over-100-executives-of-private-companies-stopped-at-the-border/story-GyxSd1oujVXqLkVg5Sr5GK.html
03-05-2020||Delhi||15 persons working at CATS ambulance call centre test Covid positive||At least 15 people working in the control room of Centralised Accident and Trauma Services (CATS) Ambulance have tested positive for Covid-19 infection in Delhi on Friday night. The control room, however, continues to function, with around 25 people responding to calls for ambulances from across the national capital.The samples of the operators were collected four days ago, and the reports returned positive for 15 on Friday night. “All operators working in one shift at the call centre have tested positive, the test reports of the remaining staff are awaited,” an official from East Delhi’s district office said.The positive patients have been admitted to Lok Nayak, Rajiv Gandhi Superspeciality, AIIMS Jhajjar and RML hospitals. Apart from the ‘102’ number for ambulance services, the Delhi government has issued four other cellphone numbers on Friday – 7291000071, 7291000078, 7291000093, 7291000094.“One of the operators had fever for a couple of days and his condition is serious. He has been rushed to RML hospital, where he has been put on ventilator support. Yet, this call centre office hasn’t been sealed. Some offices are being closed even if a single Covid-19 case is reported. How do we know that we would not get the infection? So many of us sit in the same office, share the same computers, there is always the possibility of an infection,” one of the CATS operators said, on condition of anonymity.The reports of around 50 other employees are still pending. The modern control room in Laxmi Nagar was set up in 2015 when the Delhi government launched the ‘Home to Hospital Care Scheme’ to provide free ambulance service for all medical emergencies. Earlier, the services were restricted to accident cases and deliveries.The government-run service has around 151 ambulances across the city, with 60 being deputed for transporting Covid-19 positive or suspected cases.The infection has reached the doors of front-line warriors in the city, with the staff at the office of east district’s chief district medical officer being put under quarantine after one of them tested positive for the infection three days ago. The team is responsible for surveillance of Covid-19 positive and suspected cases in the district.Over 300 health care workers and hospital staff have tested positive for Covid-19 in the city so far. At Jahangirpuri’s Babu Jagjivan Ram hospital, at least 75 hospital staff tested positive for the infection, which led to the government closing the 100-bed hospital. Around 45 staff members at Baba Saheb Ambedkar hospital also tested positive for Covid-19. Delhi State Cancer Institute reported its first cluster of infections in the beginning of April. At least 26 hospital staff have tested positive for the infection. Four patients also tested positive for Covid-19 and two of them succumbed to the illness.Almost all health care workers who tested positive were from non-Covid hospitals or non-Covid areas of hospitals.The Delhi government suspended a controversial order soon after issuing it on Friday in which it had demanded that all health care workers who test positive or come in contact with positive cases give a written explanation as to how that happened despite them following guidelines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/15-persons-working-at-cats-ambulance-call-centre-test-covid-positive/story-eulUXV2Qktx2WLKbpYo1LL.html

He had been admitted to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences’ (AIIMS) trauma centre on April 3.He had been on the ventilator and was in a critical condition when he was admitted.“He had been on and off the ventilator since his admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) last month. He died with Covid-19 in the evening,” said an official from the hospital, on condition of anonymity.He also suffered from diabetes, which increases the risk of severe symptoms from Covid-19.He was the second Covid-19 patient to be admitted to the Jai Prakash Narayan Trauma Centre, which was converted into a stand-alone Covid-19 centre, one of the three government centres in the city. The 240-bed facility is meant for those with severe symptoms of Covid-19.The new private ward at the main AIIMS campus is reserved for suspected cases, whereas those with mild symptoms are sent to the AIIMS Jhajjar campus.All trauma cases have now been diverted to the main AIIMS campus where they are handled in the emergency ward.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/lokpal-member-justice-ajay-kumar-tripathi-dies-of-covid-19/story-WGfoGbbojmRmsPC2IBTevJ.html
03-05-2020||Delhi||Students oppose Jamia move asking students to vacate campus hostels||The Jamia Millia Islamia administration on Friday asked students stranded in the university hostels to vacate rooms and leave for their homes, saying several areas near the campus had been declared Covid-19 hot spots.The university said hostel provosts would arrange transportation for them as per the travel protocol of their respective home states.The Union government had, on Friday, allowed the railways to run special trains to ferry students, migrant workers stranded in various parts of the country due to the nationwide lockdown, which was extended till May 17.However, several students wrote to Jamia’s vice-chancellor Najma Akhtar, saying they feared for their safety while travelling. They also argued that they did not want get stuck at quarantine centres after reaching their respective states.The home ministry’s guidelines for transporting workers and students to their home states, however, mandate only home quarantine, unless an assessment by local authorities deems that a person be kept in institutional quarantine.Around 300 students are currently putting up in the university’s seven hostels on campus. The other students had vacated their rooms when the lockdown was announced in March.In the order issued on May 1, Jamia registrar AP Siddiqui said, “Students stranded in the hostels who could not go back to their homes earlier and stayed back hereby directed to vacate the hostels as per the arrangements of transportation and travel protocols of the state governments. The areas in the proximity of the University being declared as hot-spots sealing the designated areas with no movements being allowed. It is difficult for the university to maintain logistics and manpower requirements in the future. The hostels are also required for sanitisation, maintenance, and for contingent quarantine facilities. Therefore, the hostels are to be vacated with no exceptions.”The Jamia order said the university will reopen in August for regular students, and the new academic session will begin in September.“The examination schedule slated for July 2020 will be notified in due course. Study materials are uploaded on the website, and students are being given e-material. We do not know how long the lockdown will continue. The university will not be able to manage under the present circumstances,” said an official.Jamia Millia Islamia, in Delhi’s south east revenue district is also a red zone along with the other 10 of the city’s districts. The Delhi government has declared parts of surrounding neighbourhoods such as Zakir Nagar, Abul Fazal and Shaheen Bagh ‘containment zones’, after several cases of Covid-19 emerged in these areas.A third-year student at Jamia’s Allama Iqbal Hostel said students are apprehensive of the travel, and fear they may contract the contagious disease. “We are also afraid that once we reach our states, we will get stuck in quarantine facilities, where there are no proper arrangements of food and medication,” he said.A resident of J&K girls hostel said, “Some Kashmiri women were sent home by the Delhi government through buses, which were stopped at Jammu border. We do not want to get stranded like that. It’s very unsafe. Also, there are elderly people back home. We can’t risk their lives.”Some students also raised the issue of poor internet connectivity in their hometowns. “We do not have Wi-Fi at home. I am preparing for competitive exams, and I need the internet for my studies. I don’t know what will we do,” said a third-year student who hails from a town in Jharkhand.University officials said the safety of students will be taken care of while travelling. “We will soon notify students about the arrangements,” a university official said, but did not give any further details.Meanwhile, no such order has been issued to students living in hostels of the two other central universities in the national Capital — Delhi University and Jawaharlal Nehru University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/students-oppose-jamia-move-asking-students-to-vacate-campus-hostels/story-Mx7Q5TcyGNqdQ6Vmn275zI.html
03-05-2020||Delhi||Stranded migrants in Delhi wait in desperation as admin readies transportation plans||As the Delhi government undertakes a survey of migrant workers stranded in the city before sending them back to their respective states, officials on Saturday said those housed in schools and shelter homes are likely to be sent back first.“The numbers are being collated. There are many who have been left behind while their families are in need back home. Unlike other states, the number of migrant workers living in Delhi is high. We will have to prioritise people in batches. Besides, even the special trains, deployed to ferry workers back home, can take only around 1,000-1,200 people at a time, keeping in mind social distancing factors,” said a senior official of the Delhi government, requesting anonymity.The official added that while trains are a better mode of transport with respect to social distancing protocol in mind, private buses will have to be hired for workers who want to travel to shorter distances. “We are coordinating with the ministry of railways as well. This is a mammoth exercise, given the large numbers, and will take a while. Going by inputs received so far, an estimated 20,000 migrants in the city are from Bihar. Numbers of those from other states are being accumulated,” he said.Tens and thousands of migrant workers who could not return to their home states because of the national lockdown, imposed to curb the spread of the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, are awaiting government guidelines on transportation. The Delhi government had issued an order Friday directing the police and the district administrations to seal all interstate borders and ensure that there is no “unlawful assembly” or “disorderly movement” of people during the lockdown, which was on Friday extended till May 17 by the Union ministry of home affairs (MHA).The order, issued by Delhi chief secretary Vijay Dev, is aimed at preventing unorganised movement of stranded people in the city. The government said it is in the process of drafting protocols and mechanisms to ensure transportation of stranded persons to other states in a planned manner.Initially after the lockdown was enforced, the city saw migrant workers setting out on foot towards the city borders in droves, and later towards the inter-state bus terminals in hope of catching a ride back home, to get back to their home states.Scores of migrant workers were stopped by the police and taken to shelter homes in the Capital, for which the state government had used 256 school buildings, where they are being provided food and basic necessities.Mahesh Kumar, 36, housed in a central Delhi shelter, said he is desperate to go back home as his mother is alone at home in Bihar’s Muzaffarpur district. Besides, he said the meals he gets at the shelter are not enough for his family of four. “I don’t know what I will do or eat once I get back, but I need to see my mother. I have also run out of balance in my mobile phone and have not been able to speak to her. A few days back, a neighbour from my village had helped me speak with her. My mother asked me to come back soon as she has no money left and is dependent on our neighbours to help her get food,” said Kumar, who used to work at a scrap dealer’s shop in Delhi.Officers of the Delhi Police, who did not wish to be named, said that migrant workers are mostly lodged in shelter homes in central, northern and south-eastern parts of Delhi. However, neither the police not the state government wanted to go on record with the exact number of migrant workers lodged in shelters in Delhi.A senior police official in Rohini district, who did not wish to be named, said that though a total of 928 persons have been housed in shelter homes in the Rohini district, only 74 of them are migrants. Besides those in shelter homes, the police official quoted above said areas of Prem Nagar and Aman Vihar house a large number of migrants but they live in rented accommodations or shanties of their own. The official added that along with migrant workers, the shelter homes in Rohini also have vagabonds and homeless persons.A Delhi police officer, on condition of anonymity, said that police teams are gathering information about migrant labourers, pilgrims and all those who are stranded in Delhi from all areas including the border areas. At the ground level, this officer said, beat and police station staff are patrolling their respective jurisdictions, day and night, enquiry about migrants who may be stranded in their respective areas.MS Randhawa, spokesperson for the Delhi Police, said: “Senior officers are being apprised of the situation regularly and constant monitoring is underway, as the lockdown has been extended. Other welfare measures of feeding those who need food and helping people with other means, within Delhi, are also going on simultaneously. We are working in close coordination with the state administration and civic agencies.”On Friday, the police department said they received many calls from migrant labourers seeking clarification on a form being circulated on messaging apps which could purportedly facilitate their return home. The police have refuted the existence of any such form, saying it is “unconfirmed news”.Deputy commissioner of police (Shahdara) Dinesh Kumar Gupta said they had got a call about some people distributing such forms. “Appeals were made to people through messages and videos on WhatsApp that the government has not issued any such form and that people must not believe such unconfirmed news. Local resident welfare associations were also sent such messages to further communication,” Gupta said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/stranded-migrants-in-delhi-wait-in-desperation-as-admin-readies-transportation-plans/story-ABQtB96D7tKii6ODXjQskJ.html
03-05-2020||Delhi||813 students stuck in Kota ferried back home by Delhi government||Sharka Uruz’s happiness knew no bounds on Saturday evening when she finally boarded a bus for her home in Delhi from Kota, Rajasthan. The 18-year-old medical aspirant was among the more than 800 students from the national Capital who was stuck in different coaching centres in Kota after to the nationwide lockdown was enforced to contain the spread of Covid-19 on March 25.The Delhi government on Saturday sent a fleet of buses to bring these 800 odd students back home. Amid cheers and applause, the students boarded buses from their respective coaching centres around 5:30 pm.Uruz, a resident of east Delhi’s Mandawali, said she was returning home after six months. But for her, and many others like her, the past one month (since the lockdown came into force) felt like a year living away from home. “We have a very tight schedule here. I was supposed to go home after the NEET exam on May 5. But then the lockdown was announced and the exam was postponed. The majority of students later left for their homes. We were only five students in our hostel during the last 40 days. It was really tough to survive. We were sad, living away from home as a pandemic raged on. But now, finally, we are going home,” she said, while speaking over the phone.As many as 45 buses were sent by the Delhi government to Kota on Friday night to bring back 813 students back home. “The government had also sent a team of nine social welfare officers, doctors, officials from the transport department and revenue department in order to facilitate the thermal screening of students and to ensure social distance is maintained throughout the journey,” a senior government official said.Officials said the buses reached Kota between 10:30am and 12:30pm on Saturday. The vehicles were then sanitised, before the students were allowed to board. ‘’One homeguard and one constable of Delhi police were deployed on each bus. Personal Protection Equipment kits were provided to the staff and buses were thoroughly sanitised upon reaching the destination. Not more than 22 students are allowed in one bus/coach,” said Harish Sabharwal, general secretary of Delhi contract bus association.All the buses later gathered at a point from where they left for Delhi together at around 8pm. Students are expected to reach Delhi by 5am on Sunday.“We were allowed to board the buses after the thermal screening. We were provided masks, sanitisers and packed food for the journey. Only one student was allowed to sit on a seat meant for two,” said Himanshu Yadav, 20, another medical aspirant and a resident of north Delhi’s Jahagirpuri.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday tweeted saying, “Hundreds of our children studying in Kota were stuck for more than a month. We are arranging for their return to Delhi. I am so happy they will soon be reunited with their families.”Delhi transport minister Kailash Gehlot said that the students would be screened again at the time of arrival. A senior government official said, “The students will arrive at ISBT from where we will arrange DTC buses to send them home. Our staff will be available at the time of their arrival and the student will be screened again. If anyone is found symptomatic, we will take steps as per laid down protocols. All the students are advised 14-day home quarantine.”The students were also briefed by Delhi police officers to not call their parents to pick them up from the drop off point. “Do not ask your parents to come to pick you up. There should be no gathering at the bus stand. We will drop you all to your homes,” a police officer told the students.The students in Kota had earlier this week launched an online campaign on Twitter demanding that the Delhi government make special arrangements to bring them back. The Delhi government on Thursday announced that it will send buses to bring back students from Kota.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/813-students-stuck-in-kota-ferried-back-home-by-delhi-government/story-GKv3duKlxkRergZamcZ08M.html

03-05-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana CM Khattar slams Congress leaders for undue criticism, Randeep defends stand||Haryana chief minister (CM) Manohar Lal Khattar on Saturday hit out at Congress leaders Kumari Selja and Randeep Surjewala for what he termed as unjustified criticism.Advising the Congress leaders to desist from political mongering in this hour of crisis, Khattar, in his televised address, said that all must face this pandemic unitedly. He also said, “In a recent all-party meeting, every leader had assured full support to the government in its efforts to combat Covid-19, yet it was very unfortunate to see that some were still busy in playing politics.”Slamming Congress leaders for questioning the decisions taken in a recent cabinet meeting regarding increasing tax on petrol/diesel, bus fare hike and imposing market fee on fruits and vegetables, the chief minister said that it was unfortunate that in this hour of crisis, Congress leaders were busy in unnecessarily politicising the state government’s decisions.Taking a dig at Randeep, Khattar said that the former had no moral authority to question the state government. People of the state, social institutions, all ministers, MLAs and former MLAs had contributed for the Haryana Corona Relief Fund. “Randeep Singh Surjewala is receiving a monthly pension of Rs 1.68 lakh from Haryana Vidhan Sabha and during his last five-year tenure as an MLA, he attended the sessions seven times only, and received an amount of Rs 1.12 crore,” said Khattar, adding that he was not aware whether Randeep Surjewala had made any personal contribution or not.He said that due to Covid-19, economic activities had almost come to a standstill, because of which for the last two months, revenue receipts had been small and about Rs 10,000 crore was required to pay the employees’ salaries, pension and other expenses of the government. Hence the cabinet decided to increase VAT by Re. 1 per litre diesel and Re. 1.10 per litre petrol, increasing bus fare by 15 paise per kilometre and imposing 2 per cent tax on vegetables and fruits in Mandis.However, reacting to Khattar’s jibes, Randeep Surjewala stood by his remarks on the new taxes and hike in bus fare and fuels charges. Stating that he had been an MLA for 18 years and chief minister for five and half years, he said in his statement released later in the evening:”Às regards my salary and pension, it is an MLA’s right not a favour extended by you. I do not alone get it, you too get it. When would you give details of salary or allowances to the tune of Rs 6-8 crore.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/khattar-slams-congress-leaders-for-undue-criticism-randeep-defends-stand/story-4zYSThZfYjv1jY38fdYTBO.html
03-05-2020||Chandigarh||With 40 active cases, Jhajjar becomes Haryana’s most affected district in just 6 days||With 12 fresh cases detected in Jhajjar since late Friday night, the district has become Haryana’s most affected district with 40 active cases in just six days since this Monday. It is followed by Gurugram which has 25 active cases and Sonepat which has 22.Until a week ago, Jhajjar district administration was being praised for not letting the deadly virus enter their territory even though it shares the border with the national capital Delhi, which is one of the worst hit states in the country. But now Jhajjar has emerged as the new hotspot in the state.33 out of 40 CASES LINKED TO DELHI’S AZADPUR MANDIAs many as 33 out of the 40 coronavirus infected patients in Jhajjar district are vegetable sellers, who frequented Delhi’s Azadpur Mandi to bring vegetables.

We are, however, looking the 40 cases in six days as our success as we managed to detect all the patients and isolate them before it spread further,” Punia said. Punia further said that all the patients have been sent to isolation ward at PGIMS, Rohtak.RANDOM SAMPLING HELPED IN DETECTING CASES: DCJhajjar deputy commissioner Jitender Singh also said that the detection of 40 cases since Monday is a positive sign for them because it helps them in breaking the chain of the virus. “Jhajjar is the first district in Haryana to go for random sampling. We had started random sampling after the district did not report any positive case for over a month even after sharing the border with Delhi, which falls in the red zone. During random sampling, we focussed on vegetable sellers, visiting Delhi’s Azadpur Mandi, shopkeepers, milkmen and Haryana residents, who are working in Delhi and commuting daily. This helped us detecting 40 coronavirus cases in just six days,” Jhajjar DC added.He further said that they have taken samples of 2,420 persons till Saturday, of whom 41 tested positive, including a pharmacist, who is counted in Delhi’s tally. Reports of 370 persons’ are awaited, he added.“We have collected 1,277 samples, of which 31 have tested positive for the coronavirus.

The swab report came on Friday early morning which tested Covid-19 positive, said officials.Ayush Prasad, CEO, Pune Zilla Parishad, said, “After this case, it has come to light that any spike in the comorbidity condition of the person may be linked to Covid-19 infection. People with lifestyle diseases like diabetes, hypertension, high blood pressure or dialysis who have to take medicines regularly and report any degrading health condition to the civic body as we will need to keep a track of it too.”“For example, people who have diabetes may not respond well to their regular medicines or report a sudden spike in blood sugar level which could be a likely indication of them being infected with the Covid-19 infection.“The 80-year-old had no history of travelling to an infected area and was not the first contact of any index case,” he said.“We have instructed tracking of co-morbid symptoms along with Covid-19 symptoms from all private hospitals. Any doctor or private hospital can either report any such patient who shows unusual health conditions to us on idsp.mkcl.org or call us on 1800 233 4130 to inform us,” said Prasad.Prasad also added that every private hospital has been allocated one Multi Purpose Worker (MPW) to keep a track of every such patient. “If such patients are reported, the line of treatment can be decided because then we will focus on the infection rather then the comorbid condition,” said Prasad.A government official on condition of anonymity said, “Twenty-two people who may have come in contact with the deceased woman have been contact-traced and their results are awaited.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/patients-with-deteriorating-health-condition-to-be-tested-for-covid-19-pune-dist-administration/story-MTPsL0Qh62tEZzrtR9dQ8N.html

During the last month, the collection through online modes increased by around 20%,” said Mukhtiar Singh, chief manager of Golden Temple, while speaking to HT.However, the total collection of the offerings at the shrine, which has been wearing a deserted look due to the curfew imposed in Punjab since March 19, has witnessed a record dip. The average collection of offerings has fallen Rs 23 lakh a day in 2019-20 to between Rs 10,000 and Rs 15,000 a day, as per Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) officials.Asked about the average amount of money being offered online, an SGPC official privy to the financial matters of the shrine said, “Actually, the banks have not given us full details yet, citing lockdown”.Ever since the lockdown has hit the exchequer of all gurdwaras, the SGPC is promoting online modes of offerings at its website and encouraging the devotees across the world to contribute especially for the Golden Temple langar, which is considered largest community kitchen in the world, through online modes.SGPC president Gobind Singh Longowal has also made an appeal to the devotees to make contributions digitally.When one visits SGPC’s official website, an icon appears regarding online modes of payment. This icon appeals to the devotees to contribute for Golden Tempe langar, which is feeding the needy people in Amritsar. These people include the migrant workers stranded in the city and the poor people.The surge in the online offering is a sigh of relief for the gurdwara body, which also runs scores of educational, medical and sports institutions apart from managing historic gurdwaras in northern region of the country.“The SGPC is extending help to the needy persons in this hour of crisis, so the devotees should come forward to contribute to these services,” said Longowal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/golden-temple-sees-20-surge-in-online-donations-amid-lockdown/story-yu6bGeKot9wPNGDaasbx9M.html

Our gymnasts are performing few drills with the help of bed, chair, pillow and hanging bars along with other physical exercises,” said Joshi who is also in the technical committee of Asian Gymnastics Union for Aerobic Gymnastics till 2022.After the lockdown was announced MAGA came up with a plan and advised coaches to start making fitness videos and share it with the players. “ Most of the coaches are making videos own their own while we have told them to learn new tricks from the senior coaches and also teach same to the gymnasts,” said Joshi.Currently, MAGA is conducting online coaching courses in which coaches of Sports Authority of India (SAI) and few foreign coaches are giving lessons to the coaches.“Every day from 12 noon to 1pm, one session is conducted – it is helping our coaches learn advance drills in gymnastics. It is a good opportunity for the beginners,” added Joshi.Injuries are very severe in gymnastics and it needs proper care to heal to create awareness among the gymnasts about the same, Joshi has created an informative lecture on injuries and uploaded it on social media. The video reflects on how one needs to take care of themselves during the lockdown.“The purpose of sharing this video was to make athletes aware of how self-care is important for recovering from injuries,” said Joshi. Helping the needyAs soon as the lockdown was announced, MAGA had started arranging funds as they wanted to help the needy. The association has also donated Rs 75,000 towards PM Cares Fund and Rs 50,000 towards the chief minister’s relief fund.“Spreading awareness and providing helping hand to needy was our first priority as there are many people in our country who are severely impacted due to this pandemic,” said Joshi.Expecting October startNormally gymnastic season starts in August but this time, the association is expecting a delayed start to the season.“I hope practice in artistic individual events start early, but other events generally in aerobic and acrobatic gymnastics will take time to start since we cannot maintain social distancing in these events,” said Joshi.“We are not planning any schedule for the new season right now and we will wait for government directions. I hope the season will start in October,” added Joshi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/training-without-apparatus-difficult-for-gymnasts-during-lockdown-says-makarand-joshi-secretary-maga/story-8tI0huXXytBgLttehPFUaL.html

A resident of Laxminagar, Yerawada, he is continuing his treatment in the hospital as he requires dialysis. He has now been shifted to the non-covid-19 ICU (intensive care unit).The hospital in a press note said the patient was initially admitted for high blood pressure and kidney ailments and later tested positive for Covid-19 infection. After being admitted to the hospital, he was detected with respiratory failure, severe anaemia and kidney failure and was being treated for the same in the ICU ward. He was also given seven units of blood during the treatment process as the kidney failure had led to an increase in creatinine in the blood of the patient. The patient had to undergo haemodialysis 10 times during the course of the treatment and later it was found that he also suffered from chronic kidney disease. Due to the respiratory failure, he was being supplied with oxygen through the ventilator.

03-05-2020||Pune||YourSpace: Covid-19 advisories must be followed, say readers||As a public servant (Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited bus conductor), I am taking care that I don’t go outside without a reason. Currently, I don’t have to go for duty due to the lockdown. PMPML is operating buses only for emergency services. I go out once in eight days and bring all the essentials. I have even stopped going out to buy milk. I am giving preference to green tea or lime water instead of the traditional tea. I have kept a simple routine with morning exercises, watching television, reading books and doing household work.My do’s include exercise, watching spiritual videos and reading books while my don’ts comprise avoiding oversleeping and overeating, spreading fake news on social media and trying to live life beyond the mobile phone and television.Nilesh LadkeHave set a daily timetableThe entire world is facing consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic. During this time, a lot of people are feeling that they are locked inside their homes. My outlook to this situation is a little different. I believe that god has given us an opportunity to bring about a change in ourselves. This is the time to decide how life will be after the lockdown ends. To utilise this opportunity, I have set a daily timetable. I meditate, perform 60 rounds of suryanamaskars, and read a book for additional knowledge. I have begun organic farming of green chilies and tomatoes in my garden. I play games like carom which are interesting and require skill. I also help my mother in her work. Parth PaygudePrioritise exercise and good health Staying healthy and being physically active is quite a task in itself on any regular day and now with more than a third of humanity in the world under lockdown, physical activity has taken a backseat in our lives. While the lockdown seems to be a great measure to prevent the spread of Covid-19, it certainly seems to have a downside on our overall health and well being. We all have a list of things that we put away due to our daily schedules, this is the right time to pull out that list and get going. Overall fitness adds to my ability to handle challenges and pressures without feeling burnt out. It also helps me keep my mind fresh and active which is a 24x7 requirement of my job as a nurse. Staying fit and eating right automatically makes you feel good and positive. With no maid to cook and clean, you are pretty much on your own and it certainly is a good way to keep those extra kilos at bay. You can try some new recipes and whip up a good meal for yourself and your family. Try walking briskly around the house or up and down the stairs. Stand or walk around when you’re on the phone, rather than sitting down. Dancing is also a great way to keep active, especially with children, so putting on some music for ten to 15 minutes, two or three times each day can really contribute to the daily exercise quota.Velankani K SwamyWork-life balance is a must The lockdown has brought a new set of challenges for working women like me. Earlier, I just needed to take care of my office work while the maids took care of my home, but since the maids are not coming, I plan my day accurately to balance both home and office work. My day starts with morning prayers and suryanamaskar. By 11am in the morning, I finish my household chores and then devote time to office work. I am really enjoying this new routine as it had made me habitual of planning a day before going to sleep. My do’s include mediation and suryanamaskar, making a timetable, going early to bed and waking up early the next day. My don’ts include spending time on social media, oversleeping and being addicted to the TV.Sunita MarneDiscover a new hobbyIt is very important to stay mentally and physically fit during these dire times. To ensure this, we must have a daily routine. The routine can include reading a book, cooking, or even doing household chores. But for overall well-being, there should be an hour or two of physical activity every day. I usually wake up and cook my breakfast in the morning followed by a little bit of reading. In the afternoon, I watch a movie or do some of the house chores and at 4:30 pm, I train which includes exercises to maintain my strength, endurance, or agility. The exercises are different everyday being a badminton player. At night after dinner, I play video games or read a book before going to bed. My do’s include discovering a new hobby, maintaining your immunity by eating well, getting enough sleep and helping your family by doing daily chores. My don’ts comprise panicking – try to keep your mind off negative things, don’t overthink and try to take things one day at a time till the lockdown is over and do not forget your goals.Varun KapurFollow routine, celebrate small victories Things have changed and a usual day for me before the lockdown looked like being on the court or in a gym for more than 8 hours a day being a strength and conditioning coach. It can be quite a challenging task to stay mentally and physically fit if that is hampered. After a lot of introspection, what worked for me were- a routine and celebrating the small victories. Making a checklist and finishing of what I wrote down keeps me going. Our mind doesn’t like to think and solve complicated problems, hence a simple checklist before hitting the bed helps to simplify daily tasks. Let’s take an example of how I relate things with my athletes. Usually, we set protocols for warming up that I relate to my daily life, which is called RAMP.Rise - Usually means increase your heart rate, but now it means waking and freshening up.Activate - Activate your muscles, meaning have your breakfast, coffee/tea, or whatever you have during a normal day.Mobilise - This is the time where we’re asking our joints to move and in our daily life, it’d be to start working and finishing your daily chores and working out. At least 30 minutes of light physical activity, staying indoors, and using bodyweight will ensure that you get adequate sleep and you’re fit.Potentiate - Doing similar movements of the sport. It means to finish off with your most important task during the first half of the day or during the time of the day when you’re the most productive.Gaurav NijhonPositive thinking key to mental fitnessLife due to Covid-19 pandemic has come to a standstill. It’s important that we keep ourselves fit, not only physically but mentally as well. I think we have got the liberty of leisure time at hand. We are saving a lot of time which would otherwise be spent on travelling. I make sure I am working out at least 3-4 times a week if not regularly. I think we should be able to enjoy the time we have and not stress over it. Being the director of the Institute of Sports Science and Technology, our regular lives have always been fast and so I am looking at this situation positively as we are getting time to spend with family and also take some time off for rest. Positive thinking is the key to mental fitness. The news of lockdown extension is certainly stressful, but keeping your mind occupied is crucial. My do’s include working out at least 3-4 times a week for 45 minutes, spending time with family, following government directives and being positive. My don’ts are do not leave your house unless in an emergency, don’t be monotonous and don’t be negative about the situation.Vipul LunawatRegular exercise must be followed I get up early in the morning and do various exercises like suryanamaskar, yoga, and kapalbhaati pranayam. In the evening, I jog in my backyard. All these exercises help me stay fit, mentally and physically, as I am a basketball coach. I manage my time by doing some household work, playing games with my family, listening to songs, reading, and face timing with my friends and relatives. After having breakfast, I listen to the news and read the newspaper online. After lunch, I take a small nap. In the evening, I go for a walk and exercise in the backyard. My do’s are taking care of personal hygiene, exercising daily, learning something new online, keeping yourself updated with all the happenings, doing some household work and taking rest. My don’ts include do not overeat, do not sleep for a long time and do not use cellphones frequently.Anand KulkarniDonate to NGOs, help the needy The first thing I did after the lockdown was declared is to spread awareness about safely using sanitisers as they can catch fire easily. I am a fire and safety consultant, I also feel that apart from contributing to government funds, people should donate money to NGOs as money will be utilised quickly and reach the needy. At our gurudwaras, in Camp and Ganesh peth, we are distributing food to the needy. Early in the morning, my day starts by doing exercises. After that, I spend time reading religious books and worshipping god, and the rest of the time I spend it with my family.Sukhinder Singh Ahluwalia||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/yourspace-covid-19-advisories-must-be-followed-say-readers/story-uktPZkIuFl5b0OgyMBNe6I.html
03-05-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai man supplied methamphetamine during lockdown, held with drugs worth Rs 35 lakh||A 36-year-old Mumbai resident was arrested after seizure of 340 g of methamphetamine drug worth Rs 35 lakh from his car on Thursday, said an official.Rohan Gawans, who lives in Mumbai’s Malad area, was arrested by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI).The drug was found in his car parked in the compound of the residential society where he lives.The DRI also raided a factory, Rohan Chemicals Private Limited, in the same area and seized raw material used to manufacture the drug. The factory is owned by Rohan and his family.Gawans was produced before a court on Friday and sent to judicial custody till May 13.Methamphetamine, commonly known as ‘ice’ among drug users, is a recreational drug which is also less commonly used as a second line of treatment for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and obesity.Rohan was earlier arrested by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) in July 2017 from the Mumbai international airport based on a lookout notice, but came out on bail after spending 17 months in prison, said DRI officials.DRI conducted the raid on Thursday after the agency received reliable inputs about the drug being concealed in a golden-coloured Toyata Innova vehicle parked at Marvel Arch Cooperative Housing Society near Mittal College in Malad (West). This is the society where Rohan Gawans lives.Officials said that a search of the vehicle was conducted in the presence of Rohan Gawans, and the drug was found concealed neatly inside the spare tyre attached to the rear end of the vehicle.A senior DRI official, requesting anonymity said, “Investigations so far indicate that Rohan used to step out regularly to supply drugs to his regular clients during lockdown. He was taking advantage of the lockdown conditions while police officials were busy dealing with Covid-19. Also, he took it as an opportunity to earn more money as those who consumed it would not hesitate to pay him two to three times the regular price.”The countrywide lockdown to curb the spread of coronavirus that first began on March 25., has been extended twice since then. It will now end on May 17. The latest announcement of extending the lockdown was made on Friday by the Centre. In the 2017 case, the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) had also named his father Prabhakar Gawans for helping Rohan manufacture drugs in the factory. The NCB too had raided the factory in 2017 and found raw materials including 4-Methylpropiophenone and Potassium Dichromate used to manufacture the drug. We are investigating how the factory started operating again,” said DRI officials.DRI is now analysing Rohan’s phone calls and contact details to know about his associates and clients, and is also investigating his bank accounts and transactions. Gawans has been booked under relevant sections of Narcotics Drug and Psychotropic Substances Act, said DRI officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-man-supplied-methamphetamine-during-lockdown-held-with-drugs-worth-rs-35-lakh/story-SAvjz7oeQEReCYX09wtrZO.html

03-05-2020||World||Coronavirus update: Stranded, ailing Indians in UK offered medical aid||Doctors and pharmacists in the Indian diaspora in the UK have been extending medicines and consultation to hundreds of ailing Indians stranded here due to the lockdown, who have run out of medicines or need medical consultation.Medicines in the UK are dispensed strictly on the basis of prescriptions issued by a general practitioner or other doctors in the National Health Service to patients registered. These are usually not freely available to visitors on temporary visas. The Indian high commission on Sunday coordinated an interaction by video-link with diaspora groups such as the British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin (Bapio), Jain Vishwa Bharti, Friends of India Society International and the Indian National Students Association. A large number of Indian-origin professionals work in Britain’s health system. According to Ramesh Mehta, president of Bapio, the group’s members have been giving prescriptions and holding consultations with the stranded Indians without charging fee. The medicines are provided by a Bristol-based pharmacy that dispenses and posts medicines on a no-profit basis.“We are delighted to support the hundreds of stranded Indian travellers and students who need medical help, and will continue to do so until it is needed. No fee is charged by our medical professionals”, Mehta said.Thousands of Indians have registered with the high commission in a list of people who are stranded and need to return home. Charter flights are expected to be organised later this month, with those in emergency situation offered priority.Rohit Wadhwana of the high commission said: “We have facilitated prescriptions, and Indians who needed the medicines were able to get them. Some had illnesses that needed continuing provision of medicines. Many had stock for their travel period but now that the lockdown has been extended it is over. Some need examination, consultation”, he added.The Boris Johnson government has extended until May 31 the visa for free of Indians whose period has or is expiring until then, while the high commission and diaspora groups and individuals have been extending a range of services to the stranded Indians, including financial and legal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-update-stranded-ailing-indians-in-uk-offered-medical-aid/story-I7QOPzKwbchRoKZvmSc2DK.html
03-05-2020||World||Islamic State prisoners riot again in northeast Syria||Militants from the Islamic State group rioted in a northeast Syrian prison Sunday, a month after similar violence at the facility allowed four extremists to escape, an opposition war monitor and a Kurdish activist collective said.Kurdish forces sent reinforcements to the prison in the eastern Hassakeh province and U.S. military helicopters flew overhead, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor, and North Press Agency, a media platform operating in the Kurdish-administered areas.Kurdish authorities currently operate more than two dozen detention facilities scattered across northeastern Syria, holding about 10,000 IS fighters. Among the detainees are some 2,000 foreigners whose home countries have refused to repatriate them, including about 800 Europeans.Further details were not immediately available on the size of the riot, and it was not clear if the unrest was triggered by concerns about the coronavirus’s potential spread in the prison.In late March, two days of riots broke out at the same facility when former IS members began knocking down doors and making holes in the walls between cells. Four prisoners escaped but were caught a day later.The riots were put down by the Kurdish-led, U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces. Afterward, the SDF’s top commander Mazloum Abdi urged the home countries of foreign fighters to find a solution for the prisoners. The riot was one of the most serious uprisings by the prisoners since IS was defeated a year ago, when the SDF seized control of the last sliver of land controlled by the extremists in eastern Syria.A resurgence of IS attacks in both Syria and Iraq has raised concerns that the militant group is taking advantage of governments absorbed in tackling the coronavirus pandemic and the ensuing slide into economic chaos.Last month, the U.S.-led coalition said it had handed over hygiene and medical supplies to detention facilities across northeastern Syria, such as hand-washing stations, disinfectant wipes, face masks and examination gloves.One coronavirus death was reported in Kurdish-held areas of Syria in April. The central government in Damascus has registered 43 cases and three deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/islamic-state-prisoners-riot-again-in-northeast-syria/story-sFFWk6dvuVD4bvPxUsEfPL.html
03-05-2020||World||European leaders unveil plans to raise $8 billion for Covid-19 treatments and vaccine||The European Union and its partners will host an international pledging conference on May 4 to raise $8 billion to kick-start global cooperation on effective diagnostics, treatments and a vaccine for Covid-19. European Council President Charles Michel, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte and Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg issued a joint appeal on Sunday for contributions to the Coronavirus global response.Saudi Arabia, the current president of the G20, on Sunday pledged $500 million to support the fundraising efforts and said it will co-lead the global response.“The pledging event aims to raise funds for the immediate need of $8 billion, which the Global Preparedness and Monitoring Board stated is urgently required to develop and deliver a Covid-19 vaccine, along with diagnostics and therapeutic resources,” said a statement from the Saudi government.People familiar with developments said the Indian government is yet to take a call in participating in the drive.The European leaders said in a statement that they intended to raise the initial $8 billion to make up a global funding shortfall estimated by the Global Preparedness and Monitoring Board and others. “The funds that we raise will kick-start an unprecedented global cooperation between scientists and regulators, industry and governments, international organisations, foundations and healthcare professionals,” the statement said.All the funds will be channelled through recognised global health organisations such as CEPI, Gavi, Vaccines Alliance, Global Fund and Unitaid to develop and deploy as “quickly as possible, for as many as possible, the diagnostics, treatments and vaccines that will help the world overcome the pandemic”, it added.The European leaders said they will also support the World Health Organization and join forces with entities such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust for developing diagnostics and treatment.“While some are cautiously emerging from lockdown, others are still in isolation and see their daily social and economic lives severely restricted. Consequences could be particularly dramatic in Africa and the Global South as a whole,” the statement said.“But what we all have in common is that none of us can really think or plan ahead with any great certainty about what the future of the pandemic really holds,” it said, emphasising the need for joint efforts against the pandemic. The European leaders said they were building on the commitment by G20 leaders to develop a “massive and coordinated response to the virus” and had launched the Access to Covid-19 Tools (ACT) accelerator, a global platform to scale-up research, development, access and equitable distribution of a vaccine and other life-saving therapeutics and diagnostics treatments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/european-leaders-unveil-plans-to-raise-8-billion-for-covid-19-treatments-and-vaccine/story-0VTm6WVcjF98reWwViZwPO.html
03-05-2020||World||US prisons hit by Covid-19 infections, fatalities||US prisons that hold the world’s largest population of incarcerated people have been hit by a wave of Covid-19 infections and fatalities and appear to be particularly vulnerable as an institution, according to multiple experts and bodies tracking their spiraling numbers.More than 14,400 inmates have been infected by the coronavirus and over 215 have been killed, according to the Marshall Project, a non-partisan news organisation that tracks the US criminal justice system. Official numbers as reported by the Bureau of Prisons, the federal body that runs and manages prison, 1,919 have been infected and 37 killed. There are 1,41,310 inmates in federally-managed institutions and 10,820 in community-based facilities in all; and 36,000 staff members,Reasons for the spiraling infections are clear. Inmates live in tight spaces, and mid low levels of hygiene. And they have suffered from the same shortages of essential medical supplies as the rest of the country. Bureau of Prisons Director Michael Carvajal complained of a shortage of testing supplies and said that quarantining remains difficult, AFP news agency reported. “We don’t have the option to close our doors or pick who or when someone is sent to our custody.”Reports are rising numbers of infections and fatalities in US prions come amidst reopening of the rest of the country as number of new cases have continued to decline, and hospitalization and intubation has dropped.The death toll rose to 66,415 Sunday morning with 1,426 in the last 24 hours, which is far lower than the more than 4,000 at the peak mid-April, and the number of cases went up to 1.13 million; up by 29,078 .While pressure have mounted for reopening the country, with President Donald Trump at the forefront, experts are urgently flagging concerns. Deborah Birx, coordinator of the president’s task force on the coronavirus outbreak, told Fox News Sunday, she was disturbed the protestors who swamped the state assembly in Michigan’s capital, Lansing, last week, some of whom were armed with guns. President Trump has backed them.“It’s devastatingly worrisome to me personally because if they go home and they infect their grandmother or grandfather who has a co-morbid condition and they have a serious or very unfortunate outcome, they will feel guilty for the rest of their lives. So we need to protect each other at the same time as we’re voicing our discontent,” she said.In another development, Republican and Democratic leaders of US congress have jointly — in rare bipartisanship — rejected the White House’s offer of instant testing kits for lawmakers. The senate is scheduled to return to work on Monday. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, said in a joint statement, the testing kits on offer can be used better among frontline workers dealing with the outbreak.“No reason to turn it down, except politics,” Trump hit back in a tweet. “We have plenty of testing. Maybe you need a new doctor over there. Crazy Nancy will use it as an excuse not to show up to work.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-prisons-hit-by-covid-19-infections-fatalities/story-I9zvLXjrFzpSQoVcKqPBnK.html

03-05-2020||World||Russia sees record rise as virus cases surge past 130,000||Russia on Sunday reported a new record daily rise in coronavirus infections as the number of confirmed cases surged past 130,000.As some European countries were looking to gradually lift restrictions, officials in Moscow -- the epicentre of the contagion in Russia -- urged residents to stay home despite glorious weather.With the number of cases rising by several thousand each day, Russia is now the European country registering the most new infections.Despite the increases, the government has indicated it could gradually lift confinement measures from May 12, depending on the region.According to the government’s daily coronavirus update, 10,633 confirmed infections were reported in the last 24 hours, bringing the total to 134,687.President Vladimir Putin has said the situation remains “very difficult” and warned that the country was not yet past the peak of the outbreak.Russia’s official fatality rate has remained low in comparison to countries like Italy, Spain and the United States.Fifty-eight people died over the past 24 hours, bringing the total toll to 1,280.The authorities are preparing to set up temporary field hospitals around Moscow including at the VDNKh, the famed Soviet-era outdoor exhibition centre, in case infections continue to surge.Muscovites have been under lockdown since March 30 and in mid-April, the authorities introduced a system of digital permits to reduce violations of the restrictions.They have warned that the rules may be tightened further.Residents of the Russian capital are only allowed to leave their homes to walk their dogs, take out trash and visit their nearest shop although private car journeys have not been restricted up to now.Many complained that it was increasingly difficult to observe the quarantine as the weather was getting warmer.In a sprawling park in southwest Moscow on Sunday, a two-person police patrol asked parents with small children to respect the confinement rules and return home.‘Threat on the rise’ Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin on Saturday urged residents to continue to respect stay-at-home rules and other measures over the long May holidays.“The threat is apparently on the rise,” Sobyanin said on his blog.Earlier this week Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin and Construction Minister Vladimir Yakushev tested positive for the coronavirus and were hospitalised.Mishustin’s first deputy Andrei Belousov is now serving as acting prime minister.Mishustin’s spokesman Boris Belyakov told reporters on Sunday that the prime minister was feeling fine and was in touch with his colleagues.The health ministry said on Friday that the number of infected children was on the rise. Two children had died from the coronavirus and 11 more were in a serious condition.Moscow alone has recorded 5,948 new cases in the past 24 hours, bringing the capital’s total to 68,606.Sobyanin said about two percent of Moscow residents -- or more than 250,000 people -- have the coronavirus.According to official statistics, Moscow has a population of 12.7 million but the real figure is believed to be higher.Putin has postponed a landmark military parade to honour the 75th anniversary of Soviet victory in World War II on May 9.He has also postponed an April vote on constitutional reforms that could allow the 67-year-old Kremlin chief to potentially stay in power until 2036.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-sees-record-rise-as-virus-cases-surge-past-130-000/story-y4zPZvLwmUmLhOy50Z8JPL.html
03-05-2020||World||Tens of thousands evacuated after Uzbekistan dam bursts||Uzbek authorities on Sunday launched a criminal probe after a major dam burst, prompting the evacuation of tens of thousands of people from flooded homes there and in Kazakhstan. The wall of the Sardoba reservoir dam in eastern Uzbekistan burst early on Friday and at least 70,000 people have been evacuated. More than 50 people were hospitalised. Over 600 homes in southern Kazakhstan have also been flooded.Uzbekistan’s state prosecutor said on Sunday that a criminal case had been opened into “official negligence” and construction violations. Construction of the Sardoba dam began in 2010 under the supervision of current President Shavkat Mirziyoyev, who was prime minister at the time. It was completed in 2017. Mirziyoyev on Friday flew to the region, which saw strong winds and rains prior to the collapse of the dam, in order to oversee the evacuation and cleanup operation. Officials in Kazakhstan’s southern Turkestan region, where more than 5,000 people have been evacuated so far, criticised Uzbekistan for not providing timely information on the status of flood control Saturday.“We have a copy of our correspondence with the Uzbek side, that as of (8 pm on Friday) the situation was stable and there were no problems,” said Saken Kalkamanov, deputy governor of the Turkestan region.“They said that not a drop of water would reach Maktaraal district,” he said, referring to the area where the flood hit. “Nevertheless, what happened has happened.”The administration of the Turkestan region estimated that the floods caused crop damage worth more than $400,000 -- mostly to the cotton, which is grown throughout the Central Asian region. sk-cr/as/wdb||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tens-of-thousands-evacuated-after-uzbekistan-dam-bursts/story-CKcV9EGD2nqGo9xguUsDMP.html
03-05-2020||World||In a random Covid test, one-third of Afghanistan’s population detected positive||One-third of 500 random coronavirus tests in Afghanistan’s capital came back positive, health officials said Sunday, raising fears of widespread undetected infections in one of the world’s most fragile states.Neighboring Iran, meanwhile, said it would reopen schools and mosques in some locations, even though the nation has been the regional epicenter of the pandemic since mid-February.The results of the random tests in the Afghan capital of Kabul are “concerning,” said Public Health Ministry spokesman Wahid Mayar. Afghanistan has performed only limited testing so far — close to 12,000, with more than 2,700 confirmed infections, in a nation of 36.6 million.As more testing becomes available, the country’s confirmed infection numbers will likely rise sharply, said Mayar. He urged residents to stay home. Kabul and most other cities are in lockdown, but compliance has not been widespread.The death toll — officially at 85 — could also be much higher.More than 250,000 Afghans returned home from Iran since the beginning of the year, fanning out across their country without being tested or quarantined. Anecdotal reports have emerged of dozens of returnees dying of Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus.At a recent briefing, a senior government official said 40 people died of the virus in Sarobi district, barely 50 kilometers (30 miles) east of Kabul. The Health Ministry said it could not confirm the claim.The country’s health care system, devastated by four decades of war, is woefully unprepared for a major outbreak. It has only 400 ventilators.The new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death.Testing in Afghanistan has been sporadic and some of those infected have been hiding their symptoms, in part because of local stigma. In parts of the country, there have been reports of Covid-19 patients being shunned by their neighbours and even refused food from the local markets.The government, embroiled in political turmoil, has also faced criticism for responding too slowly to the crisis. Only recently, the government started testing in western Herat province where the hundreds of thousands of returnees from Iran have transited.Afghanistan has two presidents, both of whom claim to have won last year’s election. American efforts to find a compromise have failed, causing U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to threaten to cut $1 billion in aid.The bickering has also delayed implementation of a U.S.-Taliban peace deal signed in February to allow Washington to end its longest military engagement, end Afghanistan’s decades of war and bring more than 12,000 U.S. soldiers home.In Iran, authorities said Sunday that 47 people had died in the preceding 24-hour period, the lowest daily toll in two months. Still, Iran remains the hardest-hit country in the Middle East, with more than 97,000 cases and more than 6,200 deaths.President Hassan Rouhani announced Sunday that schools and mosques would reopen in some low-risk locations. Schools and universities have been shut down since late February.Also Sunday, the U.N. children’s agency urged six countries in the Middle East to green-light special polio and measles vaccination campaigns that were put on hold because of the coronavirus pandemic.Currently, nearly 10.5 million children under the age of five are at risk of missing their polio vaccination, UNICEF said. Nearly 4.5 million children under the age of 15 could miss their measles vaccinations.Routine vaccinations for other diseases such as rubella and diphtheria are continuing, but special campaigns for polio and measles were put on hold in some countries because health systems were overwhelmed by the coronavirus pandemic or governments wanted to avoid crowding at clinics.The polio campaigns are on hold in Syria, Sudan, Yemen and Iraq, while measles vaccinations are suspended in Iraq, Lebanon, Yemen and Djibouti, the agency said.In Israel, the city of Tel Aviv announced it is postponing its annual gay pride parade, along with those in the cities of Haifa, Jerusalem and Beersheba. The annual event in Tel Aviv, which was scheduled for early June, drew over 250,000 people in 2019, making it one of the largest in the Mideast.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-a-random-covid-test-one-third-of-afghanistan-s-population-detected-positive/story-0F4vOY4hdTM9G7bXk1LvGL.html
03-05-2020||World||Journalism has effectively become a crime in Egypt in past 4 years: Report||Journalism in Egypt has effectively become a crime over the past four years, as authorities clamp down on media outlets and muzzle dissent, Amnesty International said in a report released Sunday.As the number of coronavirus infections in Egypt continues to rise, the government is strengthening its control over information, the London-based rights group said, instead of upholding transparency during the public health crisis.“The Egyptian authorities have made it very clear that anyone who challenges the official narrative will be severely punished,” said Philip Luther, Amnesty’s Middle East and North Africa director.Amnesty documented 37 cases of journalists detained in the government’s escalating crackdown on press freedoms, many charged with “spreading false news” or “misusing social media” under a broad 2015 counterterrorism law that has expanded the definition of terror to include all kinds of dissent.An Egyptian press officer did not respond to multiple calls seeking comment, but authorities have previously denied rights violations and justified arrests on national security grounds.Following general-turned-president Abdel Fattah el-Sissi’s rise to power in 2013, most of Egypt’s television programs and newspapers have taken the government position and steered clear of criticism, or else disappeared. Many privately owned Egyptian news outlets have been quietly acquired by companies affiliated with the country’s intelligence service.But even a pro-government voice hasn’t spared 12 journalists working for state-owned media outlets, who have landed in jail for expressing various private views on social media, the report said.One of them is Atef Hasballah, editor-in-chief of the AlkararPress website. When he challenged the Health Ministry’s coronavirus case count on his Facebook page last month, he was promptly bundled into a police van and detained on suspicion of “joining a terrorist organization.”Egypt’s public prosecutor warned in a recent statement that those who spread “false news” about the coronavirus may face up to five years imprisonment and steep fines. At least 12 individuals have been caught up in the COVID-19-motivated crackdown so far, according to Amnesty. Last month, authorities blocked a local news site that covered calls by activists to release political prisoners over fears of the coronavirus spreading in Egypt’s crowded prisons. Separately, Egypt expelled a correspondent for The Guardian newspaper over an article that indicated the coronavirus infection rate may be higher than officially reported.The journalists interviewed by Amnesty reported increasingly direct state intervention in their coverage. Many working for government-owned or aligned papers said they receive specific instructions via WhatsApp on what to report and to omit. For instance, a directive on how to handle President Donald Trump’s proposal to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict this year asked reporters not to mention the plan’s violations of long-standing Arab policies, as Trump and el-Sissi have cultivated close ties.Those who do not hew the official line, such as by praising prison conditions and smearing the state’s political opponents, “lost their jobs, were interrogated or imprisoned,” one journalist was quoted as saying. “I cannot even imagine that someone could refuse to comply.”Marking World Press Freedom Day, Amnesty urged Egyptian authorities to halt their censorship, harassment and intimidation of journalists — and to release those detained “solely for carrying out their work.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/journalism-has-effectively-become-a-crime-in-egypt-in-past-4-years-report/story-4tfheKeFyRL9x1AzpqTu8M.html
03-05-2020||World||Millions travel in China during May Day holidays as tourism, travel open up||In what appears to be the clearest sign yet of the coronavirus outbreak having abated in China, where it first emerged late last year, millions of Chinese are travelling within the country for the May Day holidays.Over 50 million trips were made in the first two days of the five-day holiday, state media reports said, adding that an estimated 90 million trips are expected to be completed by the end of holidays on Tuesday.Of the 50 million trips, nearly 23 million domestic tourist trips were made by Friday, the first day of the holiday, with the domestic tourism revenue reaching over 9.7 billion yuan (about $1.38 billion), according to the ministry of culture and tourism (MCT).The increase in domestic tourism comes after China lowered its epidemic emergency response to the second or lower categories from the most serious one.A total of 8,498 A-level tourist attractions across the country were opened to the public by Friday, covering about 70 percent of the total, said the ministry.The surge in tourism comes in the backdrop of a dramatic drop in Covid-19 cases in China, including in the once worst-hit Hubei province, and its capital Wuhan city, where the virus first emerged late last year.Chinese health authority on Sunday said that it received reports of two new confirmed Covid-19 cases on the Chinese mainland Saturday, including an imported case.As of Saturday, the overall confirmed cases on the mainland reached 82,877 and altogether 4,633 people had died of the disease, the National Health Commission (NHC) said.Authorities, however, are keeping a cap on the number of tourists – usually at around 30 percent – at many tourist places.Marking this significant trend for the nation, China’s big cities seems to be leading the surge in tourismAfter Beijing moved to announce that it would lower the public health emergency response from level one to level two effective April 30, flight bookings went up.The ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) is hoping that the increase in domestic tourism will be among the first steps to boost the economy, which contracted year-on-year for the first time in more than four decades in the first quarter of 2020.Despite the increase in tourism over the weekend, it remains much lower than corresponding volumes for other years – both the volume and revenue are expected to contract despite an extra-day of holiday this year.“China saw 195 million tourist trips during the four-day holiday that ended on Saturday, a year-on-year increase of 13.7 percent, according to the MCT. The surge of travelers pushed tourism revenue to almost 117.67 billion yuan ($17.5 billion) nationwide, a 16.1 percent increase over last year,” the state-controlled China Daily reported in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/millions-travel-in-china-during-may-day-holidays-as-tourism-travel-open-up/story-gPx8EDubvzsN59bth6tYfO.html

Some people, especially the elderly and vulnerable, found themselves stuck without food or medical supplies.Elmihnida volunteered to do grocery shopping and fetch medication for those in need.His phone is constantly ringing with calls from neighbours or friends who know of other people seeking help. He writes down their grocery and medical requests and, armed with his permit to leave the lockdown, does their shopping.He’s been helping others since he left prison a dozen years ago.Ashamed of his life of crime and drugs, he wanted more than a fresh start.He wanted to make up for the pain he had inflicted on his loved ones. He had lost the respect of his community, his parents and his friends.“My parents were ashamed of me and my actions, and I needed to make things right,” the 37-year-old said.He left prison determined not to return, and embraced “the idea of reconciliation, first with my parents who were affected the most, then with the community I grew up in.” Together with other ex-convicts and some volunteers, he worked to make life better in El Youssoufia, a densely populated, crime-ridden neighbourhood. They cleaned, painted and softened the urban grime with plantings.And then, when the virus hit, he expanded his efforts.“Noureddine is a kind man,” said his 60-year-old neighbor, too shy to identify himself by name. “He has helped deliver stuff to us without charge. When I couldn’t collect my medicine from the clinic, he did. God bless him.” Those services won the former convict recognition among more well-off residents who make donations — money that Elmihnida distributes to the poor.“I swore to God not to take any money for my services,” he said.On April 5, the Justice Ministry announced a pardon by King Mohammed VI for 5,654 prisoners to limit the spread of the virus in prisons.Mohsen Harmati, one of those set free, began volunteering that day with Elmihnida.“Noureddine was a troublemaker for 10 years, but he’s a changed man now. He has helped paint the neighborhood and plant it, and now he’s helping people at the most needy of times,” Harmati said.All that work continues. And Elmihnida also checks on migrants who camp out in the neighbourhood, their dreams of trying to cross the Mediterranean Sea to Spain scuttled by border closures.Elmihnida knows that his constant errands increase his risk of becoming infected with the coronavirus. Morocco has nearly 4,730 cases confirmed and 173 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University.“But God will protect me because he knows I’m helping people without expecting a payback,” Elmihnida said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ex-convict-helps-neighbours-cope-in-morocco-virus-lockdown/story-UXPknanpm6qYwIy1bman1J.html
03-05-2020||World||Pope Francis calls for international cooperation on finding Coronavirus vaccine||Pope Francis on Sunday called for an international collaboration in the search for a vaccine and treatment for Covid-19.Speaking from the Apostolic Palace library after delivering his blessing, Francis stressed the importance of guaranteeing “universal access to the essential technologies that allow every infected person, in every part of the world, to receive the necessary health care”. Some cross-country research is already underway to develop a safe, effective vaccine, and scientists and doctors in various nations have been sharing experiences in using different drugs to treat patients.The pope also invited faithful of all religions to spiritually unite in prayer, fasting and works of charity on May 14 to “implore God to help humanity to overcome the coronavirus pandemic”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pope-francis-calls-for-international-cooperation-on-finding-coronavirus-vaccine/story-uy6GBTeoYNisOWPbA9Y2pO.html
03-05-2020||World||Trump to take pandemic victory lap in TV ‘town hall’||Donald Trump will wrap himself in the mantle of America’s arguably greatest president with a television extravaganza Sunday at the Lincoln Memorial meant to leave the coronavirus crisis behind and relaunch his election campaign.The businessman Republican is doing poorly in most polls ahead of the November presidential contest with his Democratic challenger Joe Biden, who remains shuttered in his Delaware home.Trump faces criticism for his bruising, divisive style during a time of national calamity, and is accused by some of having botched the early response to the Covid-19 virus.Worse, the previously booming US economy, which was seen as a golden ticket to his second term, is now in dire straits due to the nationwide lockdown.But with officials saying the viral spread has begun to taper, Trump is itching to declare victory and get back on the campaign trail.That audacious shift begins Sunday at possibly the most hallowed monument in the country -- the statue of Abraham Lincoln, who led the country through civil war, urged reconciliation, and was assassinated in his moment of triumph.Trump, who calls himself a “wartime president” and the coronavirus an “invisible enemy,” will appear there for a two-hour Fox News “town hall,” taking questions from the usually friendly network’s hosts and from voters appearing by video.The memorial is only just beyond the White House fences, but in the next few days, Trump will break months of self-quarantine with long-distance trips to the key electoral states of Arizona and Ohio.It’s a play that will emphasize Trump’s massive visibility advantage over Biden and, the White House hopes, rewrite the public relations script after gaffes including the president’s suggestion that coronavirus patients ingest disinfectant.Patriotic sales pitchLincoln took the gamble in 1861 that only war could preserve the United States by ending slavery and restoring the nation’s ideals of freedom -- and he won.Trump often compares himself favorably to the 19th century national hero.Retweeting a fan’s gushing endorsement Sunday of Trump as a great friend of African Americans, the president replied: “So true, although Honest Abe wasn’t bad. Thank you!”Now Trump wants to extend that claim to great leadership by asking voters to put behind them the tragic events of the last months and to focus on his promise of “spectacular” economic recovery.The virus -- which has killed more than 66,000 Americans -- continues to inflict havoc against a background of mass unemployment, trillions of dollars in emergency government aid, and worries about a second viral wave after the summer.But Trump, tapping his salesman’s optimism, says the nightmare will end soon.“We built the greatest economy the world has ever seen,” the president said last week. “And we’re going to do it again. And it’s not going to be that long, OK?”To underline this patriotic self-confidence, he announced a series of flyovers by the military display team, the Blue Angels, including one over Washington, DC, on Saturday.Fanning the flamesDespite Trump’s eagerness to get the economy -- and his re-election hopes -- moving, medical experts warn premature reopening could bring a disastrous resurgence.On the other side, the president is pressured by many ordinary Americans whose livelihoods are under dire threat.Faced with these conflicting tensions, he has increasingly sided with Republican leaders who advocate re-opening as quickly as possible.As the decision on whether to reopen becomes ever more politicized, Trump has encouraged street protests against the lockdown.Tweeting that protesters should “LIBERATE” states and calling demonstrators in Michigan -- who included armed and camouflaged militia members -- “very good people”, he is staking out electoral territory.And while he pushes the patriotic themes inside the country, Trump is also amping up criticism on China, where the virus originated, as a foreign opponent.Beijing, he told Reuters last week, “will do anything they can” to stop his reelection -- an accusation likely to be repeated often.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-to-take-pandemic-victory-lap-in-tv-town-hall/story-gNCr7j9ug4pQQOBfM2LqYL.html

The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media.Rights groups say hundreds of Rohingya are stranded on at least two fishing trawlers between Bangladesh and Malaysia. The refugees reportedly attempted to illegally reach Malaysia, but failed because of strict patrols to keep out the coronavirus.More than 700,000 Rohingya Muslims came to Bangladesh starting in August 2017, when the military in Buddhist-majority Myanmar began a harsh crackdown against them in response to an attack by insurgents. Global rights groups and the U.N. have called the campaign ethnic cleansing involving rapes, killings and torching of thousands of homes. Currently more than 1 million Rohingya live in Bangladesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rohingya-refugees-floating-at-sea-for-weeks-land-on-bangladesh-island/story-cfzFb8BZykBNtUXG9LZJMM.html
03-05-2020||World||Top Israel court hears bids to bar Netanyahu from forming new govt||Israel’s top court Sunday started hearing arguments to bar Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from forming a new government as he faces a criminal trial on corruption charges.The Supreme Court will also hear petitions challenging a coalition deal with his rival-turned-partner Benny Gantz, who is currently speaker of the Knesset, Israel’s parliament. Either case carries with it the danger of forcing another election, after three polls in less than a year failed to produce a government and left the country in a grinding political deadlock.“Today we shall hear arguments on the question of bestowing the duty of forming a government on a Knesset member against whom an indictment has been filed,” Chief Justice Esther Hayut said as she opened proceedings.“Tomorrow there will be a hearing on the second issue, regarding the coalition agreement,” she said, sitting at the head of a panel of 11 judges, all wearing face masks in line with COVID-19 precautions.The hearing was broadcast live on the court website. Neither Netanyahu, the right-wing premier in power since 2009, nor the centrist ex-military chief Gantz, was able after a March election to form a viable governing coalition in the deeply divided 120-seat Knesset. They agreed to a power-sharing deal last month, aiming to avert a fourth poll that is opposed across the political spectrum.Netanyahu indictmentsUnder the three-year coalition deal, the government’s first six months will be dedicated primarily to combatting the novel coronavirus that has infected more than 16,000 Israelis and ravaged the economy.But eight separate petitions to the Supreme Court seek to declare the deal illegal, including one from former Gantz ally Yair Lapid, head of the opposition Yesh Atid. Lapid broke with Gantz last month when the ex-military commander was elected parliament speaker and decided to pursue a deal with Netanyahu.Hundreds of Israelis demonstrated against the deal in Tel Aviv on Saturday, the latest in a series of protests over a unity government.Sunday’s court session deals with indictments filed against Netanyahu in January. The veteran premier has been charged with accepting improper gifts and illegally trading favours in exchange for favourable media coverage. He denies wrongdoing and his trial is set to start May 24.Israeli law bars an indicted person from serving as an ordinary cabinet minister, but does not compel a criminally-charged prime minister to leave office. The complication regarding Netanyahu is that he is not currently an ordinary prime minister. He has been serving as the caretaker head of a transitional government through Israel’s period of political deadlock.According to some interpretations of Israeli law, that makes Netanyahu merely a candidate to become prime minister. Interviewed on public radio Saturday, energy minister and Netanyahu ally Yuval Steinitz said that if the court rules Netanyahu cannot serve, it would amount to “an unprecedented attack on Israeli democracy”. The Gantz-Netanyahu agreement, Steinitz said, is “a necessity, the result of three election campaigns and a desire among Israelis to avoid a fourth election”.The deal’s termsThe main argument against the coalition deal concerns specific provisions opponents say violate the law. The agreement sees Netanyahu serving as prime minister for 18 months, with Gantz as his “alternate”, a new title in Israeli governance. They will swap roles midway through the deal before likely taking voters back to the polls in 36 months. But Israeli law traditionally endows governments with four-year mandates, an issue pounced on by the deal’s opponents. There is also a provision freezing certain public appointments during the government’s initial six-month pandemic emergency phase, which critics also say is illegal.An opinion delivered to the Supreme Court this week by Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit, who indicted Netanyahu, said that while “certain arrangements in the coalition agreement raise major difficulties... at this time there are no grounds to disqualify (it).”He advised that problematic provisions be reviewed “at the implementation stage”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-israel-court-hears-bids-to-bar-netanyahu-from-forming-new-govt/story-GgYe5UteAfEyaCwnc4p7yJ.html
03-05-2020||World||Over 150,000 Indians in UAE register to return home||Over 150,000 Indians in the UAE, who wish to return home amid the coronavirus lockdown, have applied through the online registration process to the Indian missions here, according to media reports.The Indian missions in the country last week opened online registration for the expatriates who wish to fly back home after getting stuck in the country amidst the lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic.“As of 6 pm on Saturday, we received more than 150,000 registrations,” Consul General of India in Dubai Vipul told the Gulf News on Saturday.A quarter of them want to return to their homeland after losing their jobs, he said.According to a report in the Khaleej Times on Sunday, about 40 per cent of the applicants who have registered are blue-collared workers and 20 per cent are working professionals.“Roughly 20 per cent have suffered job losses and about 55 per cent of the total applicants are from Kerala,” Neeraj Aggarwal, Consul, Press, Information, Culture was quoted as saying in the report.Aggarwal said that the figures would change as they are expecting registrations from workers from other states, including Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, and Bihar.About 10 per cent of the applicants are visit and tourist visa holders who got stranded here due to the ongoing lockdown in India.India extended the ongoing lockdown by two weeks from May 4 to contain the spread of the coronavirus that has affected nearly 40,000 people in the country.Aggarwal said that a small number of the applications constitute those from pregnant women and other medical cases.Since the online registration process was launched, the Consulate’s website crashed several times due to the heavy rush of applicants wishing to register to fly back home.“The site has been working fine now though it took a lot of time for it to stabilise in the initial phase due to the heavy traffic,” the counsel general said.He said that the missions here have not yet received any information from the Indian government about the mode of transport of the stranded citizens, the prices of the tickets or how the COVID-19 test results of applicants would be assessed for their journey.“There are high-level discussions going on regarding these things,” he said in the report.Meanwhile, Norka (The Non Resident Keralites Affairs) said it has received a total of 398,000 applications from Keralites across the globe who wish to return home.“Of which, the highest numbers are from the UAE. At least 175,423 applicants have signed up from the UAE,” Norka said in an official statement on Saturday.It also received 54,305 registrations from Saudi Arabia, 2,437 from the UK, 2,255 from the US, and 1,958 from Ukraine from those who wish to return to India, the Khaleej Times reported. The coronavirus has infected 13,599 people and claimed 119 lives in the UAE, the Ministry of Health and Prevention said on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-150-000-indians-in-uae-register-to-return-home/story-MHV00A2epVIf5X0Ewt2OlO.html
03-05-2020||World||Covid-19: Mosques and schools to reopen in Iran’s low-risk areas||Iran plans to reopen mosques and schools in areas that have been consistently free of the coronavirus as President Hassan Rouhani’s government starts to ease restrictions that were aimed at containing the outbreak.With mosques closed and religious gatherings banned since mid-March as the outbreak spread in the Middle East’s worst-hit country, ordinary Iranians have turned to drive-ins for ceremonies during the holy Muslim fasting month of Ramadan.State TV and videos on social media showed people in their cars watching a religious ceremony on a big screen in a Tehran car park.“Mosques will reopen in 132 low-risk or ‘white cities’ and towns from Monday. Friday prayer sermons will resume in those areas as well ... However, all these steps will be taken by respecting the health protocols,” Rouhani said in a televised meeting.Iran’s health ministry has divided the country into white, yellow and red areas based on the number of infections and deaths.The ministry said on Saturday that the trajectory of infections has started a “gradual” downward trend in Iran, where the death toll is 6,156 and total number of diagnosed cases has reached 96,448.Iran has already lifted a ban on inter-city trips and malls, with large shopping centres resuming activities despite warnings by some health officials of a new wave of infections.School and university closures were maintained and cultural and sports gatherings are also still banned, though Rouhani said the plan is for some schools to reopen soon.“The schools in the white and low-risk areas will reopen from May 16 ... However, we will continue to review the situation,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-mosques-and-schools-to-reopen-in-iran-s-low-risk-areas/story-Q5FOBdhszwy12YwDmcPTwJ.html
03-05-2020||World||Emerging from lockdown: ‘46 days in the house was enough’||From the United States to Europe and Asia, people in many parts of the world are emerging from their homes as virus-related restrictions begin to ease and springtime temperatures climb. But the global pandemic took a turn for the worse in other places. India on Sunday reported more than 2,600 new cases, its biggest single-day jump. That followed record increases in neighboring Pakistan and Russia the previous day. There was also worrying news from Afghanistan, where about a third tested positive in a random test.China, which reported two new cases, is seeing a surge in visitors to tourist spots, many newly reopened, after domestic travel restrictions were relaxed ahead of a five-day holiday that runs through Tuesday.Nearly 1.7 million people visited Beijing parks on the first two days of the holiday, and Shanghai’s main tourist spots welcomed more than a million visitors, according to Chinese media reports. Many spots limited the number of daily visitors to 30% of capacity or less, keeping crowds below average.Masks were worn widely around the world, from runners in Spain to beach-goers in the southern United States. In New York City’s Central Park, joggers moved past each other without a glance on Saturday, and a steady stream of folks left tips for a trio working their way through a set of jazz standards alfresco.“It’s great to have an audience after all these weeks,” saxophonist Julia Banholzer, a native of Germany, said. “All my dates have been canceled through September, and I don’t know if any will come back this year. New York is a tough place, but this is just another tough period we need to get through.”Neighboring New Jersey reopened state parks, though several had to turn people away after reaching a 50% limit in their parking lots. Margie Roebuck and her husband were among the first on the sand at Island Beach State Park. “Forty-six days in the house was enough,” she said.In Spain, many ventured out Saturday for the first time since a lockdown began on March 14.“I feel good, but tired. You sure notice that it has been a month and I am not in shape,” Cristina Palomeque said in Barcelona. “Some people think it may be too early, as I do, but it is also important to do exercise for health reasons.”Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez asked citizens to remain vigilant. COVID-19 has caused more than 25,100 deaths in Spain.“Until we have a vaccine, we are going to see more outbreaks,” Sánchez said. “What we need to guarantee is that these outbreaks do not put our national health system in danger.”The divide in the United States between those who want lockdowns to end and those who want to move cautiously extended to Congress.The Republican-majority Senate will reopen Monday, while the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives stays shuttered. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s decision to convene 100 senators gives President Donald Trump, a Republican, the imagery he wants of America getting back to work, despite health worries and a lack of testing.In India, air force helicopters showered flower petals on hospitals in several cities Sunday to thank doctors, nurses and police who have been at the forefront of the battle against the pandemic. U.S. Navy and Air Force fighter jets flew over Atlanta, Baltimore and Washington, D.C., on Saturday in honor of health care workers.The number of confirmed cases in India neared 40,000 as the country of 1.3 billion people marked the 40th day of a nationwide lockdown that has upended lives and millions of jobs. The official death toll reached 1,301.Afghanistan’s health ministry said Sunday that 156 people were confirmed positive out of 500 randomly tested in Kabul, the capital. Ministry spokesman Wahid Mayar called the results concerning and said that more cases would surely be found if the government was able to conduct more tests.Russia announced 9,633 new cases Saturday, and Pakistan, nearly 1,300, both one-day highs. More than half of Russia’s new cases were in Moscow, which is considering establishing temporary hospitals at sports complexes and shopping malls to deal with the influx of patients.The virus has killed more than 240,000 people worldwide, including more than 66,000 in the United States and more than 24,000 each in Italy, Britain, France and Spain, according to a count kept by Johns Hopkins University. Health experts warn a second wave of infections could hit unless testing is expanded dramatically.For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms. For some, especially older adults and those with health problems, it can cause severe illness such as pneumonia, or death.There are economic factors to consider as well. The shutdown of businesses has plunged the global economy into its deepest slump since the 1930s and wiped out millions of jobs.Singapore announced Saturday it will let selected businesses reopen from May 12 in a cautious rollback of a two-month partial lockdown, and Sri Lanka said the government and private sector should resume work from May 11 “to ensure a return to normalcy in civilian life and to revive the economy.”Bangladesh, which opened thousands of garment factories last month, confirmed 552 new cases on Saturday.

03-05-2020||World||UK doctor alerts Indians to poor diet link with Covid-19 deaths||Poor diet is a major cause behind the Covid-19 deaths and the Indians must urgently cut down on ultra-processed food to build resilience against the deadly virus, a leading Indian-origin cardiologist in the UK has cautioned. Dr Aseem Malhotra, who is among the UK’s National Health Service (NHS) frontline medics and also a professor of evidence based medicine, said that obesity and excess weight were the “elephant in the room” that need to be addressed as a major factor behind the deaths from the coronavirus. “India is particularly vulnerable, having a very high prevalence of lifestyle related diseases,” says the 42-year-old medic, who is on a mission to spread awareness around lifestyle changes as a major weapon in the fight against coronavirus.“Specifically, conditions such as Type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease are three of the major risk factors for death from Covid-19. This is rooted in excess body fat, a cluster of conditions known as a metabolic syndrome,” he noted. Western countries such as the US and the UK have seen some of the highest death rates from Covid-19 in the world, which are likely to correlate with unhealthy lifestyles. “The elephant in the room is that the baseline general health in many Western populations was already in a horrendous state to begin with. In the UK and US, more than 60 per cent of adults are overweight or obese,” he pointed out.In the US, less than one in eight people are metabolically healthy, which means having normal blood pressure, having a weight circumference if you are a man less than a 102cm and less than 88cm for a woman and healthy levels of blood sugar and good cholesterol. “There’s no such thing as a healthy weight, only a healthy person. If people try to maintain all these metabolic health parameters through a healthy lifestyle, this could potentially be achieved within a few weeks of just a change of diet,” says Malhotra, who is from New Delhi.A recent report in the ‘Nature’ science journal revealed that patients with Type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome might have up to 10 times greater risk of death when they contract Covid-19 and called for mandatory glucose and metabolic control of Type 2 diabetes patients to improve outcomes. Malhotra warns that the medications that are used for Type 2 diabetes and many of the other conditions have “very, very marginal effects” in terms of improving lifespan or reducing risk of death, which most people are not made aware of, and they also come with side effects.“This is not to say that medications should be discontinued but the lifestyle changes are considerably more impactful on health and will reduce the need for medication. The positive news is that you can reverse this, but it is not being made aware to patients or practised by the majority of physicians as lifestyle prescriptions in India,” he said. Based on his own clinical experience and also reflected across medical literature, the expert recommends giving up ultra-processed foods, which covers any packaged food that comes with five or more ingredients, because usually these are high in sugar, starch, unhealthy oils, additives and preservatives. In the UK, these foods now represent more than 50 per cent of the diet, which he says is “really quite staggering and shocking”. Similar figures are there for the US and probably to some degree reflect why there is specifically more increased death rates from Covid-19 in these countries. “So, what I would advise the Indian population is to completely cut out these types of food from their diet, make sure that you are cooking from scratch, do not snack,” the doctor said. “Beyond that, the other issue in Indian diet is that we have a very high intake of refined carbohydrate foods, these are also foods that are particularly harmful in excess because they raise glucose and insulin and therefore rooted in many of these chronic conditions such as Type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease – this involves too much consumption of flour and white rice. “These must be swapped with a variety of wholefoods such as vegetables and fruits and for those who are non-vegetarians, it is completely fine to eat red meat as well as full fat dairy products, eggs, fish etc,” he said. In reference to recent data on the higher risk faced by black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) communities in the UK from coronavirus, the NHS doctor believes that disparity is also cultural or lifestyle related. “South Asians have been found vulnerable because the prevalence of metabolic syndrome is three-four-fold higher in the population. Indians, therefore, I think have to be extra careful with their diet and what they are consuming and they should also not have the illusion of protection just because they are given a normal body mass index (BMI). Extra body fat, particularly around the waist, is much more detrimental to health than using outdated indices such as BMI to define health risk,” he said.

The authenticity of the photos, published on the website of the official Rodong Sinmun newspaper, could not be verified.Also Read: The art of re-emergence: North Korea leader Kim Jong Un appears after long gapThe exchange of gunshots was the latest confrontation between the rival Koreas that technically remain at war.In a lengthy briefing held later on Sunday, an official at South Korea’s JCS said the gunshots did not seem a planned provocation, as the area where it occurred was farmland, but declined to provide a clear conclusion about the incident.“In absence of vision (for the target) and in the fog, would there be an accurate provocation?” the official said. Choi Kang, vice president of the Asan Institute for Policy Studies, said he believed the timing of the ‘grey area’ provocation shows it could been planned to show that Kim was still in charge of the North Korean military.“Yesterday, Kim was trying to show he is perfectly healthy, and today, Kim is trying to mute all kinds of speculation that he may not have full control over the military,” Choi said. “Rather than going all the way by firing missiles and supervising a missile launch, Kim could be reminding us, ‘yes I’m healthy and I’m still in power’.” Ewha University international affairs professor Leif-Eric Easley in Seoul said the shooting incident could be aimed at boosting morale in the North Korean military“The Kim regime may be looking to raise morale of its frontline troops and to regain any negotiating leverage lost during the rumor-filled weeks of the leader’s absence,” said Easley.“South Korea and the United States should not take lightly such North Korean violations of existing military agreements.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-and-south-korea-exchange-gunfire-across-border-at-guard-post/story-IjNOqJ3ogQf6XMGklEFfFJ.html
03-05-2020||World||The burden of coronavirus: How does Covid-19 mortality rate differ across countries||With over a million Covid-19 patients and more than 60,000 deaths, the United States continues to bear the brunt of the coronavirus outbreak. Europe is the worst-hit continent accounting for more than 1 million cases. An analysis of the Covid-19 mortality rate among European nations suggests that Germany has considerably low numbers Covid-19 fatalities as compared to other countries in the continent like France, Italy, the UK, and Spain. While the UK, Spain, Italy and France have reported more than 25,000 coronavirus fatalities, for Germany the figure rounds up at over 6000 deaths. According to the latest data, Spain has reported 216,582 Covid-19 cases, Italy is at 209,328, followed by the United Kingdom (183,500), France (168,518) and Germany with 164,967 coronavirus cases. Johns Hopkins University suggests Covid-19 countries across the globe have reported very different coronavirus “case fatality ratios”. It is the number of deaths divided by the number of confirmed cases.Also read: What is Remdesivir? How can it help in Covid-19 treatmentThe University states that the number of fatalities can differ across regions owing to the following factors:- Differences in the number of people tested: With more testing, more people with milder cases are identified. This lowers the case-fatality ratio.- Demographics: For example, mortality tends to be higher in older populations.- Characteristics of the healthcare system: For example, mortality may rise as hospitals become overwhelmed and have fewer resources, among other factors. Going by ‘case fatality ratios’, the university data suggest the US to have 5.9% Covid-19 fatality ratio (over 65,000 deaths on more than one million cases) while Germany stands at 4.1%. India is projected to have over 3% Covid-19 mortality ratio with more than 1300 deaths of total 39,980 Covid-19 cases. Johns Hopkins ‘case fatality ratios’ exhibits the ‘burden’ of Covid-19 across various countries. “Countries at the top of the figure have the most deaths proportionally to their Covid-19 cases or population, not necessarily the most deaths overall,” it says.According to the data, the list of countries with highest Covid-19 fatality ratios - most deaths proportionally to their Covid-19 cases or population - has Belgium on top with 15% Covid-19 death rate. The country has around 50,000 coronavirus patients and nearly 8,000 fatalities. The United Kingdom comes second with over 15% fatality ratio followed by France (14.7%), Italy (13.6%) and the Netherlands (12.3%) (Inputs from Johns Hopkins University)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/the-burden-of-coronavirus-how-does-covid-19-mortality-differ-across-countries/story-sZc59kQyoFxf00ppg1KupO.html
03-05-2020||World||The art of re-emergence: North Korea leader Kim Jong Un appears after long gap||When North Korea broke a three-week silence on leader Kim Jong Un’s public activity on Saturday, it offered no clue where he has been during a period of intense global speculation about his health and whereabouts, or why he was hidden from the public for so long. Instead, state media simply showed him surrounded by aides and appearing confident at a gleaming fertiliser factory that is believed by outside experts to be part of a secret nuclear-weapons programme.While much remains a mystery about Kim’s condition, the abrupt re-emergence of the relaxed and smiling leader was clear choreography of key messages from the secretive government: Kim is the supreme leader in full control of a drive to improve the impoverished country’s food security and economy, amid tough international sanctions and the threat of the new coronavirus.CENTRE OF WORLD NEWSThe official Rodong Sinmun newspaper devoted three of its six pages on Saturday to touting Kim’s leadership, crediting him for what it called prosperity and self-reliance.Reuters could not verify the accuracy of official accounts or the authenticity of pictures from the event.The sprawling complex is the result of Kim’s vision to build a modern factory that will support agricultural production and make progress in automating its chemical industry, Pak Pong Ju, a party elder and a loyal aide to Kim, said at the ribbon-cutting where Kim reappeared.North Korea is under sanctions over its nuclear-weapons and missile programmes, leaving the country chronically struggling with food shortages, aggravated by bad weather and mismanagement.Kim’s appearance at the Sunchon fertiliser plant, which official media said occurred on Friday, was an example of “field guidance” - a key part of Kim’s public persona, where he presides over an event at a major industrial or social project, or at other times at military drills involving strategic weapons such as ballistic missiles or tactical warfare.His second public visit this year to the site 50 km (30 miles) north of the capital Pyongyang included a sizeable audience of officials from the army, the ruling Workers’ Party and the local community. Many wore face masks in an apparent precaution against the coronavirus.“Agricultural production is a top priority, which has a direct impact on the lives of the people,” Koh Yu-hwan, the president of the Korea Institute for National Unification, a South Korean government think-tank, said. Koh said Kim’s sudden return was “a strategy to be in the centre of world news without resorting to nuclear or missile tests.”THE ENTOURAGEThe makeup of Kim’s entourage featured familiar faces at such events, including two at the forefront of the North’s years-long drive to improve economic conditions: former premier Pak Pong Ju, who is Kim’s deputy at the State Affairs Commission, and Pak’s successor as premier, Kim Jae Ryong.The pair had accompanied Kim on his last major field guidance, the March groundbreaking of the General Hospital in Pyongyang. To Kim Jong Un’s immediate right on the podium was his sister, Kim Yo Jong, a vice director of the party’s Central Committee and unofficially her brother’s chief of staff. SECRET PROJECTThe phosphate fertiliser factory in Sunchon, under construction since June 2017, has received much attention from North Korea’s leaders, with multiple visits by Kim Jae Ryong and Pak. International observers say the plant is part of the North’s clandestine pursuit of uranium extraction for use in nuclear weapons, as the mineral can be a byproduct of making phosphate fertiliser. There is strong evidence the factory is involved in uranium extraction, said a report this month by the Center for Nonproliferation Studies, based in California, in line with Kim’s policy of pursuing economic and military strength.The North is motivated to use the plant because it is cost-effective and can easily conceal uranium enrichment, which Pyongyang has long sought to hide, the report said. Uranium enrichment offers an alternative to plutonium processing as a fuel for nuclear weapons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/the-art-of-re-emergence-north-korea-leader-kim-jong-un-appears-after-long-gap/story-cB1fPxsdDNpR6FqJ7kdeNN.html

03-05-2020||World||‘Nothing can stop America’: Warren Buffett says US can withstand Covid-19||Billionaire investor Warren Buffett on Saturday said the United States’ capacity to withstand crises provides a silver lining as it combats the coronavirus, even as he acknowledged that the global pandemic could significantly damage the economy and his investments.Over more than 4-1/2 hours at the annual meeting of Berkshire Hathaway Inc, Buffett said his conglomerate has taken many steps responding to the pandemic, including providing cash to struggling operating units, and throwing in the total on a multi-billion-dollar bet on U.S. airlines.Buffett also said he remains keen on making a big acquisition, which he has not done since 2016, but has not provided financial support to companies as he did during the 2008 financial crisis because he saw nothing attractive enough, even after the recent bear market.The 89-year-old opened the meeting in Omaha, Nebraska with 1-3/4 hours of remarks to soothe anxious investors, urging them to stay committed to stocks despite this year’s bear market, even if the pandemic gets a second wind late this year.Illustrating his remarks with dozens of plain black-and-white slides, Buffett called dealing with the pandemic “quite an experiment” that had an “extraordinarily wide” range of possible economic outcomes.But he said Americans have persevered and prospered through such crises as the Civil War in the 1860s, the influenza pandemic a century ago and the Great Depression. American “magic” prevailed before and would do again, he said. “Nothing can stop America when you get right down to it,” Buffett said. “I will bet on America the rest of my life.”The meeting was held virtually for the first time because of the pandemic, without shareholders in attendance, and streamed by Yahoo Finance.Buffett and Vice Chairman Greg Abel, 57, spent nearly 2-1/2 hours answering shareholder questions posed by a reporter.Abel has day-to-day oversight of Berkshire’s non-insurance businesses, and is considered by many analysts and investors a top candidate to eventually succeed Buffett as chief executive.BERKSHIRE EXITS AIRLINESThe meeting began several hours after Berkshire reported a record $49.75 billion first-quarter net loss, reflecting huge unrealized losses on common stock holdings such as Bank of America Corp and Apple Inc during the market meltdown.While quarterly operating profit rose 6%, several larger businesses including the BNSF railroad posted declines, hurt by the negative impact of COVID-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus.Buffett said operating earnings will, through at least this year, be “considerably less” than they would have been had the pandemic not occurred.Berkshire’s cash stake ended the quarter at a record $137.3 billion, though Buffett said “we’re willing to do something very big,” perhaps a $30 billion to $50 billion transaction.But it won’t be in U.S. airlines, after Buffett confirmed that Berkshire in April sold its “entire positions” in the four largest: American Airlines Group Inc, Delta Air Lines Inc, Southwest Airlines Co and United Airlines Holdings Inc.Buffett said he “made a mistake” investing in the sector, which the pandemic has changed “in a very major way” with no fault of the airlines, leaving limited upside for investors.“It is basically that we shut off air travel in this country,” he said.The meeting was devoid of the surrounding three-day weekend of dining, shopping and other celebratory events that annually draw tens of thousands of people to Omaha for what Buffett calls “Woodstock for Capitalists.”ABEL SHARES THE STAGEAbel stood in for longtime Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, 96, who normally joins Buffett to answer shareholder questions.Buffett said Munger was in “fine shape” and “good health,” and looked forward to attending Berkshire’s 2021 annual meeting.Vice Chairman Ajit Jain, 68, who oversees Berkshire’s insurance businesses and is also considered a possible CEO candidate, was also absent from the meeting. Abel lives closer to Omaha than Munger and Jain.Berkshire has said its board of directors knows who would become CEO if Buffett died or became incapacitated.Buffett’s eldest son Howard would likely become non-executive chairman, and portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler could succeed Buffett as chief investment officer.Abel told investors “I don’t see the culture of Berkshire changing” after Buffett and Munger are no longer there.He also said Berkshire was likely to expand its workforce, which totaled 391,539 people at year end, even though some businesses have furloughed employees and cut salaries since the pandemic began, and could start resorting to layoffs.Berkshire wouldn’t be alone. Nationwide jobless claims have since March 21 totaled about 30.3 million, or 18% of the workforce, a level not seen since the Great Depression.Abel nonetheless said that in five years, “we see our employment numbers being far greater than they are today.”Shareholders also elected Kenneth Chenault, a former chief executive of longtime Berkshire holding American Express Co, to Berkshire’s board, making him the company’s first African American director.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nothing-can-stop-america-warren-buffett-says-us-can-withstand-coronavirus-pandemic/story-KNb4CpS6KqGDy512U9TjMM.html

They will be divided in two groups of 500 each and prayers will be offered for one of the groups.Also, neither group will be informed about the prayers.The four-month study will investigate “the role of remote intercessory multi-denominational prayer on clinical outcomes in Covid-19 patients,” according to a description provided to the National Institutes of Health. Half of the patients, randomly chosen, will receive a “universal” prayer offered in five denominational forms -- Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, and Buddhism -- while the other patients will constitute the control group.All the patients will receive the standard of care prescribed by their medical providers and Lakkireddy has assembled a steering committee of medical professionals to oversee the study.“We all believe in science, and we also believe in faith,” Lakkireddy said.“If there is a supernatural power, which a lot of us believe, would that power of prayer and divine intervention change the outcomes in a concerted fashion? That was our question,” he said.The investigators will assess how long the patients remain on ventilators, how many suffer from organ failure, how quickly they are released from intensive care and how many die, Lakkireddy said.He describes himself as “born into Hinduism,” but said he also attended a Catholic school and had spent time in synagogues, Buddhist monasteries, and mosques. The physician said he cannot explain how people praying remotely for someone they don’t know (or a group of people,) could actually make a difference in their health outcomes, and acknowledged that some of his medical colleagues have had “a mixed reaction” to his study proposal.Lakkireddy said he has no idea what he will find, “but it’s not like we’re putting anyone at risk.

03-05-2020||World||‘It was 50-50’: UK PM Boris Johnson reveals doctors had contingency plan if he died of Covid-19||Doctors at a London hospital had made arrangements to announce the death of Prime Minister Boris Johnson, he revealed on Sunday, describing his near-death experience after contracting coronavirus and emerging after a stint in the ICU to the relief of many.Johnson, 55, was moved to the St Thomas’ Hospital on April 5 when his condition worsened, and emerged on April 12, grateful to the medical staff for saving his life when, as he said, “things could have gone either way”.Speaking to The Sun on Sunday, an emotional Johnson recalled his brush with death, when he was administered ‘litres and litres’ of oxygen but ICU monitors showed little progress, forcing doctors to make plans to announce his passing away.He recalled: “It was a tough old moment, I won’t deny it. They had a strategy to deal with a ‘death of Stalin’-type scenario. I was not in particularly brilliant shape and I was aware there were contingency plans in place. The doctors had all sorts of arrangements for what to do if things went badly wrong”.“It was hard to believe that in just a few days my health had deteriorated to this extent. I remember feeling frustrated. I couldn’t understand why I wasn’t getting better. But the bad moment came when it was 50-50 whether they were going to have to put a tube down my windpipe. That was when it got a bit . . . they were starting to think about how to handle it presentationally.”Johnson went through mixed emotions within a month: recuperating in the country residence in Buckinghamshire and later witnessed his partner, Carrie Symonds, delivering his son, whose middle name is Nicholas, named after doctors Nicholas Price and Nicholas Hart, who saved his life in ICU.Thanking the medical staff for bringing him back from a precarious condition, he said: “It was thanks to some wonderful, wonderful nursing that I made it…I can’t explain how it happened. I don’t know . . . it was just wonderful to see the . . . ”The tabloid’s report said his voice faltered and eyes reddened during the interview in Downing Street, as he added: “I get emotional about it . . . but it was an extraordinary thing,” admitting that he was initially reluctant to go to the hospital.He said: “I’ve broken my nose, I’ve broken my finger, I’ve broken my wrist, I’ve broken my rib. I’ve broken just about everything. I’ve broken all sorts of things, several times in some cases. But I’ve never had anything as serious as this”.“All I remember feeling was just frustration. I couldn’t see why I wasn’t getting better. I was just incredibly frustrated because the bloody indicators kept going in the wrong direction and I thought, ‘There’s no medicine for this thing and there’s no cure’. That was the stage when I was thinking, ‘How am I going to get out of this?’”He insisted: “It would be wrong to say that at any stage I thought, ‘Oh my goodness, this is it’. Some terrible buoyancy within me kept convincing me that everything would almost certainly be all right in the end. But I was just frustrated. I remember seeing a lot of other victims, both going in and going out of intensive care”.According to the interviewer, David Wooding, Johnson is a changed man after the experience: “Over the years, I’ve met or interviewed Boris Johnson many times — but this meeting was like no other. Not only were we forced to sit far apart for social distancing, but it’s clear his brush with death has left him a changed man.”As of Saturday, the UK’s death toll was 28,131 and had registered 182,260 coronavirus cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/it-was-50-50-uk-pm-boris-johnson-reveals-doctors-had-a-plan-if-he-died-of-covid-19/story-m3P3IPx9vxvn64Zmi3kMyJ.html

03-05-2020||World||US fatalities may hit 100k: Donald Trump||President Donald Trump on Friday revised his estimate of US fatalities from Covid-19 to “hopefully” less than 100,000, just days after expressing fears it could go up to 70,000. His initial estimate based on projections by his coronavirus task force was around 200,000 deaths.Over the last 24 hours, the country reported 1,947 new fatalities and 34,037 new infections.The American president, who once dismissed the Covid-19 outbreak as something that will “disappear” like a “miracle”, has in recent weeks used projections to take credit for taking action and preventing more deaths.“Through our aggressive response and the remarkable commitment and bravery of the American people, we have saved thousands and thousands of lives,” Trump told reporters on Friday before heading out to Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland.He said, “People were thinking in terms of 1.5 million lives lost to 2.2 (million) without the mitigation. Hopefully, we’re going to come in below that... 100,000 lives lost, which is a horrible number nevertheless.”To apparently keep a tight control on its narrative about the handling of the outbreak, the White House has blocked Anthony Fauci, a top government epidemiologist and member of the US coronavirus task force, from testifying before a congressional committee next week. The Trump administration argued that making key officials who fight the outbreak appear at hearings will be “counterproductive”.States such as California and Michigan are being very careful with their curbs and have tightened restrictions. Beaches and some public parks in California have been closed indefinitely, while Michigan has extended the lockdown to May 15.In New York City, a nursing home on Friday reported the deaths of 98 inmates from Covid-19. “It’s absolutely horrifying,” mayor Bill de Blasio said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-fatalities-may-hit-100k-donald-trump/story-AJNSQh0Hj2D7o2W39GofTJ.html
03-05-2020||World||US okays remdesivir for emergency Covid-19 use||The US drug regulator has allowed emergency use of experimental antiviral drug remdesivir for Covid-19 treatment based on early clinical data that showed it helps coronavirus patients recover faster. The drug is made by Gilead Sciences and is the first to be approved globally as a treatment for the viral pandemic that has killed over 240,000 people worldwide.The emergency authorisation allows products to be used for treatment without full data on their safety and efficacy, which has to be still submitted as trials continue. “This was lightning speed in terms of getting something approved. From clinical trial to getting it authorised, it was 90 days,” said US Food and drug Administration (FDA) commissioner Stephen Hahn.Remdesivir, when administered by an intravenous infusion, helped patients recover in 11 days on average , compared to 15 days taken by those on placebo, according to a study sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.US President Donald Trump, who announced the authorisation at the White House on Friday accompanied by top officials of his coronavirus task force and Gilead CEO Dan O’Day, called the drug the “hot thing” and “an important treatment for hospitalised coronavirus patients” and a “promising situation”.The emergency use will be limited to hospitalised Covid-19 patients with low blood-oxygen levels or those who need breathing support, the FDA said.“It is reasonable to believe that remdesivir may be effective in treating Covid-19, and that, when used under the conditions described in this authorisation, the known and potential benefits of remdesivir when used to treat Covid-19 outweigh the known and potential risks of such products,” the US regulator said. “Remdesivir... will be used only to treat adults and children with suspected or laboratory confirmed Covid-19 and severe disease defined as SpO2 ≤ 94% on room air, requiring supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).”Hospitalised patients in need of oxygen support account for about 14% of Covid-19 patients, according to early studies of the outbreak. Patients on mechanical ventilator or ECMO should be given the drug for 10 days, while those who are less sick should get it for five days, Gilead said.“The data shows that remdesivir has a clear-cut, significant, positive effect in diminishing the time to recovery,” said Anthony Fauci, a member of the White House coronavirus task force.Former Indian Council of Medical Research director-general Dr Nirmal K Ganguly said Gilead plans to expand remdesivir trials to many countries, excluding India. “Since the supply (of remdesivir) is limited, according to Gilead, India must consider ways to make this drug available to its population,” said Ganguly.Public Health Foundation of India president Dr K Srinath Reddy said one trial compared five days’ regimen with 10 days’ regimen and noted equal clinical recovery time. “There was no control group and effect on deaths was not studied. Another trial was randomised, had a control group of standard care, and observed a benefit in the reduction of recovery time from severe illness. The impact on death was, however, not statistically significant and hence unproven.’||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-okays-remdesivir-for-emergency-covid-19-use/story-CqBC5S1Fb1B49ShiY13DLM.html

We will expose, sooner than later, those surveys that tend to portray bad picture about ‘Freedom of Press’ in India,” he wrote.The minister’s comments come in the backdrop of an annual Reporters Without Borders analysis released last month, which showed that India dhad ropped two notches on a global press freedom index to the 142nd place out of 180 countries.A government official, who requested anonymity, said that while the media in the country was free and even social media was abuzz because of the liberty they received, some surveys did not do justice to the independence the media enjoys in India.“In fact, there are questions about how these surveys collect their evidence on the basis of which they draw conclusions,” said the official.Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president J P Nadda, in a separate tweet, said the press was the fourth pillar of India’s democracy and played a great role by shaping opinions and creating awareness.“On this World Press Day, I salute our media persons for risking their lives to make public aware of various aspects of COVID-19,” he said.The opposition Congress went on the offensive.“India slipped two places in World Press Freedom Index to 142. As we commemorate World Press Freedom Day, we must remember that the BJP is hell bent on destroying this fourth pillar of democracy and we shouldn’t let that happen,” the opposition party said on its official Twitter handle.“To all the journalists we would say, Daro Mat (don’t be scared),” it said.World Press Freedom Day was proclaimed by the UN General Assembly in December 1993 on the recommendation of UNESCO’s General Conference. Since then, May 3, the anniversary of the Declaration of Windhoek for the development of a free and pluralistic press, has been celebrated as the World Press Freedom Day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/javadekar-attacks-press-index-says-indian-media-has-freedom/story-OynQCVL8PnRsX9OrQ4X7cK.html
03-05-2020||India||Digital teaching may become new norm but hurdles remain||Once schools and colleges reopen in the wake of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, the way teachers teach and students learn seems set for a fundamental change, like so many other hallmarks of life as Indians have known them.Online lessons, for one thing, may be the new normal in a post-Covid-19 world in which the need to avoid close physical contact and practice social distancing will gain greater currency. “The component of online learning is definitely going to increase vis-à-vis face-to-face classroom teaching,” said Pramod Kumar Jain, director of the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)-Banaras Hindu University “ Another important {subject} on which norms will have to be established is social distancing on campus. These are the two immediate impacts of the Covid-19 crisis on education.”The outbreak of Sars-Cov2, the virus that causes the coronavirus disease, has disrupted education across the country where schools and colleges were ordered to shut and cancel examinations. The disease and its aftermath have also led to delays in competitive admission tests such as the Joint Entrance Examination that qualifies students for entry into the Indian Institutes of Technology,.leaving the future of tens of thousands of students in uncertainty. Most institutions are awaiting directions from the government to decide when to resume teaching although the higher education regulator, University Grants Commission (UGC), has given them a free hand in dealing with the situation depending on their needs “The restrictions may be eased but till the time public transport does not open up, it will be difficult to have life back to normal in the campuses. However, there is a greater emphasis on online modes and every institute will have to develop its capacity {for teaching online ,” said a senior official at the human resource development (HRD) ministry, which oversees education, requesting anonymity.Most schools have started online lessons during the lockdown, but deficient technology infrastructure and lack of experience loom as potential setbacks in educating and testing students on the Internet.The National Testing Agency, the Central Board of Secondary Education and state education boards aren’t prepared enough to administer a test that students can attempt sitting at home, policymakers said. To be sure, the availability of net connectivity and hardware at the students’ homes is another concern.“This is an area where on which there can be more focus in the coming years. The UGC, which had not pushed for reforms like open book tests etc, has now allowed universities to adopt these options. This experience will have an immense bearing on the way we look at evaluation,” said the HRD ministry official cited above.Students are, meanwhile, waiting anxiously for the dates of incomplete board examinations; the Delhi government says that conducting the exams is not feasible..“Given the disruptions during the lockdown, educational institutions have lost time that was needed in completing the academic courses. While many institutions have adopted the use of online platforms, these have largely been taking the classroom in video conference mode. With teachers not able to view the receptivity of students through their body language and concentration levels, there is limited clarity on the effectiveness of learning,” said Anindya Mallick, partner, Deloitte India.. “Once institutions open for classroom teaching, it will be clear how much students have been able to learn..,” he said. Academic courses/ syllabi are designed with a standard timeline and level of learning/ content in mind.”’Mallick added: “Truncating the course due to curtailment of an academic year is not an optimum learning option. The challenge, therefore, is how to complete the academic year’s course curriculum and ensuring the effectiveness of learning across all students in the class.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/digital-teaching-may-become-new-norm-but-hurdles-remain/story-W9yFeEOCNvx7FqAn7R7dTN.html

But on Sunday, 150 of them attempted to flee protesting lack of proper facilities. While the police managed to catch 50 of them, a hunt is on to nab the rest.The labourers alleged that they did not get food, drinking water and other facilities at the two quarantine centres. “After we reached the quarantine centre, we did not get any water to drink or to take bath. We were told that the officials had made arrangements for only 60 people. Why should we stay in quarantine if we don’t get basic facilities,” said one of the migrant labourers working in a diamond polishing units of Surat. “If the government can’t provide food and other facilities to 100 people, how would they ensure stay of lakhs of people who are returning to the state,” the labourer asked.A similar scene played out in another quarantine centre of Khallikote block where the migrant workers created a ruckus over being served breakfast of upma at noon. In a video that has gone viral, the migrant workers, kept in an Adarsh Vidyalaya of Subalaya grampanchayat of Khallikote block, are seen putting the upma served on a disposable plate on ground refusing to eat it. Subalaya sarpanch Kedar Swain, however, said that the matter has been sorted out.As per the guidelines of the Odisha government, all migrant workers who are returning to villages will have to undergo a 14-day mandatory quarantine in the 7,000-odd temporary medical centres. The state government has approved per diem expenditure of Rs 120 on their food for an adult and Rs 100 for a child below 14 years. Similarly, Rs 300 would be spent on personal hygiene kit that includes tooth brush, paste, tongue cleaner, soaps, oil, razor, masks, sanitary pad, mug, bottle and bucket. After successful of quarantine, each of them would get Rs 2,000.The jumping of quarantine came on the heels of two of the Surat-returned migrants in Ganjam testing positive. Both the Surat returnees, aged 17 and 22 years, were asymptomatic and travelled in a bus. Till now, 162 persons in Odisha have tested positive with more than half turning out to be with travel histories to Covid hotspots like Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Gujarat.Sounding a warning for those jumping quarantine, chief secretary Asit Tripathy said violators will be arrested as per the Epidemic Act and will not get the Rs 2,000 incentive. “The returnees, who are creating nuisance and escaping from quarantine centres, will be kept at quarantine centres away from their respective home districts. Once caught, these violators will be arrested and their quarantine period will extend,” said Tripathy.“In the last two months, we have been able to contain Covid-19 spread in Odisha in comparison to other states. A lot of frontline workers are working 24x7 across the state and their contribution is commendable. We will continue the good work and will not comprise it at any level,” he said, requesting migrants coming by buses to avoid overcrowding and maintain social distancing. “Buses must have a valid pass, without which entry into the State borders will be denied. Overcrowded buses will also be denied entry.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-150-migrant-workers-jump-quarantine-in-odisha-state-government-warns-of-arrest/story-sFSrkdf91WDmtmcYPRMsBL.html

Nissar Ahmed was a winner of Padma Shri, Sahitya academy award, Karnataka Rajyotsava award as well as Pampa and Nadoja awards apart from several others.Ahmed was considered a key pillar of the Navya movement in Kannada literature. While he is known for his several notable works like Manasu Gandhi Bazaru, Mandondige Mathukathe, Sanje Idare Mele and various other offerings, it was Nithyothasava a poetry collection he released in 1974 which brought him eternal fame.One of the songs in the collection ‘Jogada Siri Belakanalli’ which celebrates the natural beauty of Karnataka is almost seen as an unofficial state anthem. Ahmed was also the President of the 73rd Kannada Sahitya Sammelan held in 2007 at Shivamogga. Leaders across party lines condoled the death of the poet with CM Yediyurappa saying his death was a ‘irreparable loss’ to Kannada language and its literature.

Not everyone needs a personal protection equipment (PPE); there has to be a rational use of these kits which is why the ministry has explained in great detail as to where all PPE kits, especially the entire set, is required to be worn mandatorily,” said a senior health ministry official, requesting not to be identified.In the past, there have been instances of spread of infection reported from a few non-covid hospitals such as Delhi State Cancer Institute in Delhi, Brijesh Banger Memorial Hospital in Bhilwara Rajasthan, or Mumbai’s Wockhardt Hospital among othersThere is a need for rational use of PPE kits based on the risk profile of the health-care worker, says the health ministry.Technical teams working on the guidelines divide the risk profile into three categories--mild, moderate and high, wherein mostly those working in the high-risk areas need to wear the entire PPE set comprising N-95 mask, coverall, goggle, latex examination gloves and shoe cover.As per the guidelines, all areas in the OPDs and in-patient departments (IPDs) fall under the mild to moderate categories, with N-95 masks , goggles, latex examination gloves and face shields being enough to handle patients. Even sanitation workers, who clean frequently touched surfaces, floors, and change linen, have a low risk profile that needs them to wear triple-layer medical masks and latex examination gloves.The area in the hospital that would require healthcare workers to wear the entire PPE set because of the high risk of contracting infection is when attending to severely ill patients while performing aerosol generating procedures in the emergency department. Also, wearing a PPE set is mandated for health-care workers when they manage patients of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) in an ambulance. “Following overall infection control and prevention guidelines for hospitals is extremely important to reduce the risk of spread of infection. Even if there is a case reported from a hospital, the health ministry has earlier issued detailed do’s and don’ts that must be followed,” the official cited above added. The ministry has also been reiterating the fact there was no shortage of PPE kits in India, and domestic manufactures have begun manufacturing the kits that will soon help in matching the country’s requirements.The total projected demand for PPE kits till June has been estimated to be 20.10 million. Orders to the tune of 22.20 million have already been placed, of which orders for about 14.20 million have been placed with domestic manufacturers, and 8 million kits are being imported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mark-separate-triage-area-for-flu-like-cases-health-ministry-to-non-covid-hospitals/story-uCzoXblK54n6okqfaEpFFK.html

According to the Union Health Ministry, these teams will be deployed in 20 districts -- Mumbai, Thane, Pune in Maharashtra; Bhopal, Indore in Madhya Pradesh; Ahmedabad, Surat and Vadodara in Gujarat; South East and Central Districts in Delhi; Jaipur and Jodhpur in Rajasthan; Agra and Lucknow in Uttar Pradesh; Hyderabad in Telangana; Chennai in Tamil Nadu; Kolkata in West Bengal; and Kurnool, Guntur and Krishna in Andhra Pradesh.  These teams comprising experts from National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), AIIMS, JIPMER and All India Institute of Hygiene and Public Health among others will submit reports to additional chief secretary/principal secretary/secretary (health) of respective states detailing their observations, areas for improvement and recommendations, according to an office memorandum issued on May 2. “A decision has been taken in the Ministry of Health to deploy public health teams to assist health departments in managing Covid-19 outbreaks in selected districts,” said an official. The regional directors under the ministry of health in these nine states and one Union Territory will coordinate the deployment of these teams with the state health authorities. All the 20 districts are in the red zone. The ministry has listed 130 districts in the country in ‘red’ zone, 284 in ‘orange’ zone and 319 in ‘green’ zone on the basis of incidence of cases of Covid-19, doubling rate, extent of testing and surveillance feedback. This classification of districts is to be followed by states and UTs till a week post May 3 for containment operations. The list will be revised on a weekly basis or earlier and communicated to states for further follow-up action. India registered a record jump of 83 deaths and 2,487 cases in 24 hours as the number of Covid-19 fatalities rose to 1,306 and total cases climbed to 40,263 on Sunday, according to the Union health ministry. The number of active Covid-19 cases stood at 28,070, while 10,886 people have recovered and one patient has migrated, it said. The total number of cases also include 111 foreign nationals. According to the health ministry data updated in the evening, the highest number of confirmed cases in the country is from Maharashtra at 12,296, followed by Gujarat (5,055), Delhi (4,122),Madhya Pradesh (2,846), Rajasthan (2,772), Tamil Nadu (2,757) and Uttar Pradesh (2,626).

On its part, the BJP ‘s alliance partner Janata Dal (United) has defended the “Nitish Model” of dealing with lockdown as the most effective.The latest spark came after BJP’s Bihar president Sanjay Jaiswal in a Facebook post questioned state government’s “lackluster approach” in dealing with the migrant issue.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage.“The problem with Bihar government is that none of their officials clarify before the media as to which types of shops will open in which zone or which train is coming to Bihar and where to get registered. As a result of the state government’s attitude, people are posting on social media whatever they want. The state government should take lessons from the Yogi government in UP. UP chief secretary briefs the media very well,”Jaiswal, the West Champaran MP said in his post.Only on Saturday, the state government had issued clarifications on reports that nodal officers have gone incommunicado and released fresh helpline numbers.The state government also announced details of trains which would be coming with migrants and students. The BJP which is the junior partner in the coalition now finds itself in an awkward position after Jaiswal’s post. A section of BJP leaders led by MLC Nawal Kishore Yadav, tried to control the damage by praising chief minister Nitish Kumar.“There is no better CM in the country than Nitish Kumar,” he said and refused to draw parallels with UP CM Yogi Adityanath. “I do not know anything about Yogi government’s work. He (Nitish Kumar) is a better CM that is why BJP is supporting him,” he said.The JD (U) came out in defence of Nitish Kumar and said that the Bihar CM does not believe in “populist measures.’“Bihar did not commit the mistakes which states like UP or Punjab did. Bihar’s CM’s measures have been more protective, more answerable than his counterparts of UP and Punjab. Had he not adhered to the Centre’s guidelines, the number of positive cases would have been more,” argued JD (U) national principal general secretary, K C Tyagi. “Bihar model has saved Bihar,” he added and said that every party has the right to place its view.But Jaiswal’s barb has given the opposition another opportunity to attack Nitish Kumar’s government.RJD spokesperson Bhai Birendra said that the government needs to reply on issues raised by the BJP president. “When we raised the issue, it annoyed the JD (U) leaders. We had been demanding extraction of students but the Nitish Kumar government turned it down citing lockdown norms,” he said.Leader of opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav said that the state government has no definite action plan to bring people stuck in different states. “The nodal officers have switched off their mobile phones or cannot be reached. The state government is also charging tickets from migrants,” he said.The evacuation of stranded migrant workers and students stranded in different states had snowballed into a major issue with Nitish Kumar insisting that there would be no evacuation unless the Centre changed the norms which it did on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-bjp-boss-attacks-nitish-kumar-over-lockdown-handling-jd-u-defends/story-I1wttaZtUDqbraJHdxttHK.html
03-05-2020||India||Maharashtra’s retired top cops donate PPE kits to police staff battling Covid-19||Retired police personnel have joined hands to provide safety kits to their juniors who are working in the frontline in the battle to contain the Covid-19 outbreak. Former police officers of the 1983 batch have donated face shields, hand sanitizers and gloves to working policemen since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. The retirees include former ACPs and senior inspectors who donated the protective material in different regions and districts in the past four weeks.D D Wadmare, retired ACP from the 1983 batch said, “I was in the services for 31 years and have seen many critical situations during my service but nothing can beat this lockdown. It is emotionally very difficult to leave our family at home and be strong while on duty to control whatever situation comes our way. India, is currently, fighting the Covid-19 virus and illiteracy as well. As an ex-cop, I know how the crowd behaves and the hatred they have for policemen. They have many doubts in their mind and so answering them with a calm mind is always on priority for police officers.”“My eyes are always on the news and when I got to know that a few cops are ill and affected with the disease, I decided to distribute safety gear. I got in touch with my former colleagues who are also retired and shared my thoughts. They appreciated my idea and helped me with more funds. So far I have distributed over 2,000 safety kits to various police stations like Powai, Sakinaka, MIDC, Sahar, Thane,- Rural: Mira Road and Bhayandar division, Palghar and many more on my list. My other mates are joining the initiative and we have placed an order for more safety kits. This is giving me mental peace that our Corona Warriors are safe and can confidently handle the situation. A family friend name Vicky Motvani, a businessman, also came forward and contributed towards the safety kits for the policemen,” Wadmare said.Rajan Ghule, a retired ACP (1983 batch) from the Dindoshi division, said, “My friend Wadmare has always been known for being the best in his services, be it as a cop during his tenure or now as a retired police officer. His thought of reaching out to the warriors by distributing the safety kits was really great. As soon as I got to know about it, I requested him to get kits for the officers in my locality. An officer out on duty has to keep themselves calm and strong during their working hours and knowing their other colleagues are getting infected would put their morale down. This initiative will boost the morale of the police officers out on the field to handle any situation coming their way if they have the safety kits with them.”Khanderao Patil, a retired ACP from Mahim division said, “This is a critical situation in India and through this initiative I can only help in giving my 5% to the department. Coming home safely to your family is the best feeling a warrior can have during a situation like this. The safety kits will ensure that their basic safety is under control in any given situation.”Popatmaharaj Tiwatne, another retired ACP said, “The cops are the first source to reach the public and have to travel in the deepest area for research along with medical teams. Their safety is as important as the doctors so distribution of these protective kits will encourage them to fight Covid-19 in a better way. Being a former cop, I know a police officer is the primarily connect for the public in their area and they have to handle any given situation during this time. Crowds cannot be bifurcated in infected and non-infected category. So, the safety gear will help them be on the safer side of the situation.”Retired ACP Dinesh Agarwal from the 1985 batch got in touch with other cops as soon as he got to know about Wadmare’s initiatives. He was overwhelmed with the thought and shared his contribution to get 500 face shields and distributed them in most affected areas like Dharavi and Shahunagar police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-s-retired-top-cops-donate-ppe-kits-to-police-staff-battling-covid-19/story-28F44V1oGk7v9fbD7pm4GL.html

Addressing a press conference to elaborate on the fresh guidelines that will be effective up to March 20, the chief minister said that most services and economic activity will be allowed to resume within the state including shops selling non essential items and liquor stores but will have to close by 6pm so that everyone can be home by 7pm. “Only essential workers like medical workers and other essential services like shops selling essentials and milk will be allowed to be open after 7pm,” Sawant said. “Goa is a green zone and there has not been any fresh cases since April 3 and the last patient was discharged on April 17. It is important that Goa remains a green zone which is why we have to continue with some restrictions,” Sawant said. Restaurants, street eateries, beach shacks and drinking in public places as well as public gathering, malls, gymnasia, community halls, religious services continue to remain prohibited as part of the national guidelines. The restart of public transport will bring a huge relief to industries, private offices as well as government servants who were forced to either travel by their own vehicles or government operated buses, whose services were limited. Municipal markets are set to open in a limited way, as it is expected that normalcy will take some more time to resume. Liquor traders have however said they expect a 70% dip in sales given that tourists, who are a large chunk of consumers in the state will not be around. “Because of the absence of tourists, liquor stores, when they re-open, are expected to witness a 70 per cent drop in sales,” Dattaprasad Naik the president of the All Goa liquor traders association, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/public-transport-private-offices-to-reopen-in-goa-from-may-4/story-sbBVI7mRozdUQV4Q8UFqNP.html

Both my paternal and maternal sides are based there and so much miss them. I was there this February for my brother’s wedding and what a blast we all had,” said the versatile singer over phone. Rahul remembers his initial days when he had reached Mumbai from Kolkata with degree but mind and soul for music. “Whatever I have learnt in Kolkata was not enough to obtain work, so I started a job in a music house and tried hard to get work but it went in vain. I knew I had learnt music and I trained in both Indian and Western music extensively but still the big break was evading me. Then, one of my friends helped me reaching my mentors and composers Sachin-Jigar who finally gave me a break in ‘Happy Ending’ shot on Saif Ali Khan.”Last year he sung and composed a Hindi song for a German film ‘Checker Tobi und das Geheimnis unseres Planeten.’ The film has been well received internationally but could not have a theatrical release in India. “In India we don’t release German films but after much persuasion the makers have agreed to officially release the song ‘Sapney…’ in India. I am absolutely thrilled as this is my first international project that went on to be so big. I am honoured to a part of an international film so early in my career.”He got this project after the director of the German film happened to hear his song ‘Jab We Met’ from film ‘Hero’ and wanted his song also to be on the same lines.Talking about his days in quarantine, the UPite says, “Lately, I have been releasing a lot of covers for my listeners. The list includes ‘Enna Sona,’ ‘Sooraj Dooba Hai, ‘Dill Diya Gallan,’ and more. Also, recently I have recreated 90’s hit number ‘Ho Gayi Hai Mohabbat’ by Aslam and Shibani Kashyap for a music company and the response is phenomenal.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/singer-rahul-pandey-on-a-cover-release-spree/story-M2thDj13vUQK4nXNIz4kqL.html

03-05-2020||India||Congress will again form govt in MP after by-polls: Kamal Nath||Madhya Pradesh Congress president Kamal Nath claimed on Sunday that the Congress party would again form the government in the state after the by-polls to 24 state assembly seats are held.Kamal Nath, whose government lost the majority in the state assembly after a rebellion by 22 party MLAs, said, “The voters are wise enough to understand the BJP’s designs. The voters of the 22 constituencies, from where Congress MLAs resigned in March, know well that their representatives betrayed them and their party. The BJP will face anti-incumbency in the by-polls whereas, the Congress enjoys the trust of people.” The rebellion had compelled Nath to tender his resignation from the chief minister’s post on March 20.In reply to a question he said the rebellion was unexpected.“Neither myself nor Digvijaya Singh ever believed that 22 of the Congress MLAs would be lured to betray the party and part ways with it,” he said.He also played down the allegations levelled by the rebels that he didn’t listen to them and ignored development work in their constituencies.“I have got a complete list of works recommended by the MLAs and done by the then government. But I don’t want to go into it. I am confident that our party is going to win the by-polls convincingly,” Nath said.On allegations that senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh used to run his government from behind the curtains, Kamal Nath said, “I never outsourced the government. I ran my government. It’s wrong to say that the MLAs were upset. I used to have meetings with ministers and officers to take decisions on public welfare schemes. At the same time, I used to meet MLAs too.”He also responded to chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s allegations that the then Congress government did nothing to contain the coronavirus spread in the state and said his government undertook adequate measures including testing for the disease. Nath said it was under the BJP government that the coronavirus situation worsened in the state.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesChief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said that the previous Congress government had created a “chaotic” situation in the state. “The real heroes and true leaders are those who helped in uprooting a corrupt government. Jyotiraditya Scindia is such a leader for whom the interest of the state is supreme. That’s why he parted ways with the corrupt government, along with his friends,” he added.Chouhan said he also held the Congress rebels in high regard since they decided to put their political careers at stake to dislodge a “self-centred” government.“Those who worship a particular family and don’t think of the public interest can’t run their government for long even if they are able to get power by mistake,” Chouhan said.The Congress formed the government in the state on December 17, 2018, after securing 114 seats in the 230-member state assembly in the November elections. The government was also supported by 7 MLAs including 4 independent, two BSP and one SP MLAs.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19After the resignation of 22 Congress MLAs in March, the Congress is left with 92 MLAs, while the BJP has 107. Other two seats fell vacant after two MLAs--one each from the Congress and the BJP-- died. The present strength of the state assembly is 206 and the reduced majority mark is at 104.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-will-again-form-govt-in-mp-after-by-polls-kamal-nath/story-MUGWHDKJ5gSlpXQwlSwHaO.html

Strong winds and thundershowers is likely to continue impacting the region on Monday and Tuesday due to an intense western disturbance and moisture incursion from both the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal.“There is heating in many parts of the country and (also) a lot of moisture incursion from the Arabian Sea. All conditions are favourable for thunderstorm activity over northwest India. Western Disturbances (WDs) pass through the region round the year but this time we are also seeing some intense WDs,” said M Mohapatra, the director general of IMD.IMD’s Sunday bulletin said due to strong southeasterly and easterly winds from May 3 to 6 in the lower levels over northern plains of India, along with fresh moisture incursion from both the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal, fairly widespread rain and thunderstorms as well as lightning and gusty winds (30-40 kmph) is likely over this region. Peak activity over the Western Himalayas is likely on May 4 and 5, while peak activity over the northern plains, including Uttarakhand, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi and western Uttar Pradesh is likely on May 5.“Already hailstorm has started impacting south Haryana and some parts of Rajasthan. Rest of the northern states are experiencing thunderstorms and rain. This year we had a pattern of unusually high number of WDs since January, when there were nine WDs against a normal of three-four. In April there were seven WDs,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head of regional weather forecasting centre. “It’s too early to link it with climate change. We have to see if this pattern sustains for a few years,” he added.Scientists earlier told HT that such changes in the WD pattern may be due to weather anomalies in Europe, because WDs originate as low-pressure systems in the Mediterranean or they could also be linked to favourable sea temperatures over the Pacific.The maximum temperature on May 2 reached 44 to 45 degrees C in parts of Vidarbha, Marathwada and southwest Madhya Pradesh. Heat wave conditions are likely to develop over these areas in the next three-four days, according to IMD.

Almost 12% of the respondents (11.7%) were doctors and 88.3% were nurses.The study found that the prevalence of skin injuries was higher in men than women, in doctors than in nurses, in ones wearing Grade 3 PPE than in ones wearing Grade 2 PPE and those wearing the equipment for more than four hours daily than in ones who used it for less than four hours. The researchers also found that older people and those who sweated heavily suffered more injuries.In many cases, the kind of injuries on doctors and nurses were more severe than those in patients they were treating. The susceptible parts of skin injuries in medical staff were on the nose bridge, cheeks, ears, and forehead, the study found.“These significant findings are consistent with independent observations in Europe and United States, and call for systematic studies addressing skin injury and repair in Covid-19 patients as well as in their health care providers,” said Chandan K Sen, a professor at Indiana University.The researchers offered several reasons for the injuries. The first, while staff using PPE should be replaced every four hours, because of the pandemic, many worked for 8-12 hours continuously.“Of their long hours wearing PPE, the N-95 respirators or surgical masks and goggles would compress nose-bridge and cheeks, a mask strap would compress the ears, and face shield and surgical cap would compress the forehead, which might be the main cause of skin injuries on multiple parts of the head and face,” the study said.Moreover, the researchers said sweating caused redness, pain, itching, or prickling, which might be the main cause of skin damage. “Soaked skin combined with pressure increased friction coefficient between the PPE and skin, and when masks and goggles were removed quickly, skin tear was ready to happen,” the study added.In India, where many doctors and nurses are working round the clock, health care staff faces similar problems, said experts. “Because of the pandemic and long duty hours of doctors and nurses, many complained of excessive sweating and restricted movement with PPE. Duty hours should not be more than six hours,” said Girish Tyagi, member, the Delhi Medical Council||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/prolonged-ppe-usage-can-cause-skin-injuries-warns-study/story-gtYIi2Em6F1Yo1OW2By2JJ.html

Not everyone needs a personal protection equipment (PPE); there has to be a rational use of these kits which is why the ministry has explained in great detail as to where all PPE kits, especially the entire set, is required to be worn mandatorily,” said a senior health ministry official, requesting not to be identified.There is a need for rational use of PPE kits based on the risk profile of the health-care worker, says the health ministry.Technical teams working on the guidelines divide the risk profile into three categories--mild, moderate and high, wherein mostly those working in the high-risk areas need to wear the entire PPE set.As per the guidelines, all areas in the OPDs and in-patient departments (IPDs) fall under the mild to moderate categories, with N-95 masks , goggles, latex examination gloves and face shields being enough to handle patients. Even sanitation workers, who clean frequently touched surfaces, floors, and change linen, have a low risk profile that needs them to wear triple-layer medical masks and latex examination gloves.The area in the hospital that would require healthcare workers to wear the entire PPE set because of the high risk of contracting infection is when attending to severely ill patients while performing aerosol generating procedures in the emergency department. Also, wearing a PPE set is mandated for health-care workers when they manage patients of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) in an ambulance. “Following overall infection control and prevention guidelines for hospitals is extremely important to reduce the risk of spread of infection. Even if there is a case reported from a hospital, the health ministry has earlier issued detailed do’s and don’ts that must be followed,” the official cited above added. The ministry has also been reiterating the fact there was no shortage of PPE kits in India, and domestic manufactures have begun manufacturing the kits that will soon help in matching the country’s requirements.The total projected demand for PPE kits till June has been estimated to be 20.10 million. Orders to the tune of 22.20 million have already been placed, of which orders for about 14.20 million have been placed with domestic manufacturers, and 8 million kits are being imported||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/identify-area-away-from-opd-for-flu-like-cases-govt-to-non-covid-hospitals/story-SqWCgMqkn3BgQ4aOp0GnBN.html

The state has been showing a sharp decline in coronavirus cases in the last few days and on Saturday it reported only two positive cases while on Friday it drew a blank.The minister said out of 499 Covid-19 positive cases in the state, 95 people are in the hospital and others have been discharged. Out of 95 cases, the maximum number of cases are in Kannur (north Kerala) 37, also a red zone. At least 21,720 people are under observation and 32,217 samples have been tested. The state has the lowest mortality and highest recovery rate in the country.Kerala was the first state in the country to report a coronavirus case in January 2020, when a medical student who had returned from China tested positive for the disease.Covid-19 cases increased in the first week of March after people started returning from middle-eastern countries and Europe. At one point it was leading in cases of the infectious disease but after the Tablighi Jammat conference in Delhi, numbers in other states shot up. In terms of mortality and recovery rates, the state has been displaying good progress, statistics show.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-flattens-covid-19-graph-for-now-registers-no-new-cases/story-WY7kChacxqbRJUjZIo90GI.html

The labourers from Maharashtra were agitated at not being allowed to enter Madhya Pradesh on their way to Uttar Pradesh, said police.While sub-inspector Omkar Lal sustained head injuries, two constables sustained minor injuries. A heavy police force deployed at Bijasan in Sendhwa rural police circle controlled the situation, said Sendhwa police.At least 4000 labourers, who had gathered at Bijasan looking to proceed to Uttar Pradesh, blocked the traffic on Agra-Mumbai national highway on Saturday evening.They lifted the blockade around midnight but again blocked the traffic on Sunday morning. When police didn’t allow them to proceed, a section of agitated labourers indulged in stone-pelting, resulting in injuries to the cops.The labourers withdrew from the highway on an assurance from the Barwani district collector that the issue was being discussed with the Uttar Pradesh government. The labourers said they were giving two hours time to the administration to meet their demand.Sendhwa rural police station in charge, Vishwadeep Singh Parihar, said, “Medical treatment of the sub-inspector is going on. An FIR is being lodged against unidentified persons involved in the attack. However, no arrest has been made so far in this connection.”Another administrative official in Barwani said, “On Saturday, Uttar Pradesh didn’t open its border for hundreds of labourers sent from here in more than 200 buses. That’s why movement of other labourers coming from Maharashtra was blocked. Uttar Pradesh government is perhaps conscious that these people are coming from Maharashtra, one of the worst Covid affected states.”Barwani District Collector Amit Tomar said they were awaiting instructions from the state government for further action. “However, labourers are satisfied after having a talk with us. We are providing food and other facilities to them,” he said.Similarly, about 7000 to 8000 people, mostly labourers from various parts of Maharashtra assembled near Joharia village at the MP-UP border in Datia district on Saturday since Uttar Pradesh didn’t allow them to enter.Datia District Collector Rohit Singh said that the situation didn’t deteriorate there.“There was no road blockade like situation or any other law and order problem at the border. Since a large number of people had assembled here; it was a matter of concern for us, but we managed to control the situation. They entered Uttar Pradesh after the latter granted permission to them,” Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/three-mp-cops-injured-in-stone-pelting-by-labourers-waiting-to-enter-uttar-pradesh/story-wLaod9EWYu4vkYhLo8laBL.html

He explained that states, which were practically encouraging migrant workers home, should account for the fact that the state’s economy would take longer to revive in the absence of the migrant workforce that powers most industries.This was one reason why the Centre had been reluctant to run special trains also. It, however, finally relented when the chorus from the states became too loud.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/don-t-send-every-migrant-home-centre-rebukes-states-for-missing-fine-print/story-uw3p10wm3Qpj587FfRBlSN.html

Several complaints were raised by transporters that their goods trucks are not being allowed by the local authorities and the movement of empty trucks from one state to another. The ministry has recently written to all states reminding that trucks should not be stopped at borders to maintain the supply of goods. The control room number (1930) is being made available for the benefit of drivers/transporters who can now lodge any complaint pertaining to the lockdown, a statement by the Press Information Bureau said. In addition, National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) helpline number 1033 is also available for highway-related grievances. It added that the NHAI, transport departments of states and Union Territories and transport associations will take necessary steps to provide information to drivers and transporters in this regard. “The officials deputed from ministry of road transport in the MHA control room will assist in complaint/ grievance resolution relating to the Transport sector/Drivers. These officials would also compile the daily report on such complaints received,” it added. “This mechanism is expected to greatly address the issues/hurdles in the movement of goods across States/UTs during lockdown announced to curb COVID-19 pandemic in India,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mha-looks-to-address-grievances-of-truckers-during-lockdown/story-0fHaN3Jar0lflhBQabuhnM.html

The premier body of all the major Akhadas, Akhil Bharatiya Akhada Parishad, has sought to know why places of worship seemed not to be on the government’s priority list when permission had been granted for the reopening of authorized liquor shops in the Orange and Green Zones.Mahant Narendra Giri Maharaj, the president of the Akhada Parishad demanded that portals of religious places of importance should be opened up for priests, saints and devotees while following precautionary measures like social distancing.“As relaxations are being given, it’s imperative that shrines, temples, ashrams and muts are also included in the list of exemptions with compulsory enforcement of social distancing norms and use of facemasks for both seers and devotees. Religious and spiritual aspects can’t be ignored for long as they provide immense spiritual, mental and physical solace to people,” said Mahant Hari Giri Maharaj, general secretary of the Akhada Parishad.Similar demands were made by priests who conduct ash-immersion rituals at Haridwar. They said the restriction imposed on the rituals of last rites during the lockdown was “unprecedented”.Ganga Sabha president Pradeep Jha pointed out that ash immersion rituals are performed within a specific timeframe as per Hindu and Vedic traditions and added that a memorandum has been given to the state government for allowing ash immersion rituals in the holy city of Haridwar.“Religious rituals are an integral part of all people’s lives, irrespective of their sect or community. With specific restrictive, preventive guidelines, surely temples and Har-Ki-Pauri can be opened up for devotees as has been done for Gangotri, Yamunotri and Kedarnath,” said “Pradeep Jha, president Ganga Sabha.Muslim cleric Maulana Iqbal Ahmed has also urged the state government to allow the offering of prayers at mosques while promising adherence to social distancing and other preventive measures.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesReacting to the demands, cabinet spokesperson Madan Kaushik said that all aspects were being considered by the Central and state governments but ensuring the safety of human beings was their first priority.“The government is opening up or relaxing restrictions, but majorly it depends on Covid-19 containment and figures from the area concerned,” he said.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19“Prior to lockdown, temple committees had ensured that pilgrims wore facemasks and use sanitizers. We will apply even stricter safety measures if the government allows the shrines to open to the public,” said Mahant Ravindra Puri, head of Shri Mata Mansa Devi temple trust.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/where-are-your-priorities-uttarakhand-seers-clerics-question-freeze-on-religious-activities/story-Gc5a9KdLyNau98IfQYfV0N.html

That phone call told the scores of soldiers and police officers waiting around the house in Handwara’s Chanjmulla locality that they had probably taken a hit.Col Ashutosh Sharma, the 44-year-old commanding the 21 Rashtriya Rifles battalion, had entered the house with company commander Major Anuj Sood, 30, Naik Rajesh Kumar, 29, Lance Naik Dinesh Singh, 24, and J&K Police Sub Inspector Sageer Pathan aka Qazi, 41, a little after 5.30 pm.

03-05-2020||India||India knows how to handle countries like Pakistan: Ram Madhav||The post Covid-19 world order will be “markedly different” and it will be in Pakistan’s own interest to change its actions like supporting terrorism, BJP National General Secretary Ram Madhav said on Sunday, asserting that India knows how to handle such countries. In an exclusive interview to PTI, he also said that there will be a flight of capital from China in the post pandemic phase and India will be an attractive destination for investments by global corporate giants. Strongly rejecting allegations of “Islamophobia” in India, Madhav said Prime Minister Narendra Modi is enjoying support of all communities in the fight against coronavirus and those suffering from “Modi-phobia” are trying to communalise the country’s discourse. In an apparent reference allegations of Muslims being targeted for the spurt in Covid-19 cases after a Tablighi Jamaat congregation in Delhi, the BJP general secretary said: “It will not be fair to blame an entire religious community for perceived mistakes of some members of a group. It doesn’t help the community and country at large.” On Pakistan, Madhav said the country has not relented on its anti-India and pro-terror campaigns even when the entire world is focusing on dealing with the coronavirus crisis. “It shows that somewhere something is hugely amiss in Pakistan’s leadership. It doesn’t want to improve relations with India,” he said. Madhav said Pakistan itself will be forced to decided what place it wants in the post Covid-19 global order. “It is as much a question to Pakistan as much to China.” He further said: “It will be in Pakistan’s own interest to change its actions in emerging new world order and India knows how to handle such nations.” Pakistan has been unrelenting in its efforts to push militants into India as there have been rising incidents of unprovoked firing by Pakistan military along the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir in the last few weeks notwithstanding the coronavirus crisis, according to military officials. Talking about China, Madhav said he felt many companies will move out of the neighbouring country in the wake of the coronavirus crisis and India will be an attractive destination for them. “In the post COVID period there will be a flight of capital from China and India will certainly be an attractive destination for them,” he said. The BJP leader said the allegations of “Islamophobia are nothing but some sort of propaganda and are not based on the ground reality. There has been a wave of angry reactions on Twitter by leading citizens and rights activists from various Arab countries following allegations that Muslims are being blamed for spreading Covid-19 in several parts of India. The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, a powerful bloc of 57 countries, recently accused India of “Islamophobia”. India rejected the charges as regrettable. Crediting Modi’s leadership for effectively handling the pandemic, Madhav said: “India has set a shining example that how visionary leadership, democratic governance and popular support can work together to face such challenges.” He said one of the major reasons for successful handling of coronavirus crisis is that the country is “unitedly” standing behind the government. Referring to surveys showing higher approval ratings for Modi among global leaders, Madhav said they reflected that he is enjoying the support of Muslims, Christians and all other minorities. “Look at the way the country has responded to his clarion calls to light lamps or clap for corona warriors. But some elements are trying to communalise the discourse as they are suffering from Modi-phobia,” he said.

03-05-2020||India||Kerala begins reverse quarantine to protect vulnerable from Covid-19||With a large number of its expatriate population expected to return by next week, Kerala is set to take the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic to the next stage by showcasing a plan to protect the aged and people who suffer from co-morbidity conditions.Kerala, which has the lowest mortality and highest recovery rates in the country, has prepared a blueprint for ‘reverse quarantine’ and grassroots health workers have started monitoring health conditions of aged and people who are immuno-compromised. No new cases were reported on Sunday. The state has recorded 499 cases of Covid-19 out of which 95 are active. Experts say reserve quarantine is a practice of isolating the most vulnerable people, aged or people with co-morbidity conditions, from the rest and monitor their health conditions closely to protect them from infection.Click here fro full Covid-19 coverage.“In Kerala we have 70 lakh people who are above 65 years of age and suffer from diabetes, cancer, blood pressure, heart ailments, kidney disease and respiratory tract infections. They are sitting ducks. Our priority is to detach them from others and protect them,” said Dr B Ekbal, who heads an expert panel that advises the state government on prevention of coronavirus.“In case of a community spread we can isolate vulnerable populations and check their mortality rate effectively unlike what happened in some of the western countries. We have formed grassroots committees to monitor their health conditions. Besides local body members, Asha workers, resident association office-bearers, youth volunteers and local police officers will be part of these committees,” he said.Dr Ekbal said reverse quarantine was nothing new and had been tested during earlier pandemics but was not widely publicised.Experts like him feel that reverse quarantine is a viable option against Covid-19 till a vaccine is found. Once a person is in reverse quarantine a separate room with a bathroom can be given to him/her and his/her interaction with other family members will be limited. Even if they interact, social distancing and using masks are must for them in the house. If he/she takes it in the right sense that it is for his/her sake it will be a success, they said. In north Kerala many cancer patients are already in reverse quarantine now.“Since it is a new virus we need a multi-pronged strategy to deal with it. Reverse quarantine is one among them. We can’t say how long the virus will be active and achieve herd immunity. So we can isolate people who are more prone to it. As Kerala is an informed society it is better to practise here,” said epidemiologist and former principal of the Vellore Christian Medical College Hospital Dr Jayaprakash Muliyil.Experts say during reverse quarantine a sense of deprivation and neglect will be quite high among people and it has to be addressed adequately by family members and counsellors. In certain areas especially north Kerala palliative care is strong and services of those volunteers can be used here, said Dr Ekbal.“We can’t live in lockdown like this for long. We have to live with it till a vaccine is found. So we have to evolve a mechanism to suit this. Like social distancing, reverse quarantine is a way to check mortality rate,” said another expert.The key is “minimum exposure” of the vulnerable to the outside world, he said.In red zones in Kerala, there is a ban on people above 65 and children below 10 years of age stepping out of their houses.The state is planning reverse quarantine in a big way as it expects an exodus from the west Asian countries by next week. At least 3.50 lakh people have been registered on a website opened by the government. The government is being more cautions this time after some of the returnees from Dubai in March jumped home quarantine and infected many others with Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-begins-reverse-quarantine-to-protect-vulnerable-from-covid-19/story-KY3yAlYuKCymaJ5gQkmZVN.html

The CRPF has been the worst hit with more than 100 of its troopers testing positive in Delhi which forced it to seal its headquarters on Sunday. Click here for full Covid-19 coverage.The police chiefs have also been asked to consider the option of work from home for personnel not deployed on frontline and where feasible. “To meet the challenge of Covid-19, and to ensure sustainment of control strategy for Covid-19, police forces need to prepare an effective second line of defence to make up for the police personnel who may be rendered ineffective due to Covid-19 infection during the pandemic,” stated the order reviewed by HT. The government has suggested that the home guards, NCC etc can especially be of help in maintaining order at the relief centres and in facilitating the maintenance of supply chain and for coordinating other essential services. The police have also been asked to help the general public and deal with them with empathy and compassion especially the weaker sections of the society. The cops have been asked to also monitor religious and social congregations during festivals to ensure social distancing. “Police should also be watchful of migrant labourers/slums to contain any unexpected and undesirable mass movement,” it stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mha-orders-second-line-of-defence-for-police-as-covid-19-cases-rise/story-eWL9dC33JqQV6GN5SWETuN.html

While Red Zones are classified on the basis of number of positive cases, recovery rate, doubling rate, the extent of testing and surveillance feedback from the districts, Green Zones include districts that have not seen any positive case in the last 21 days, all the other districts that do not fall into these two categories, are in the Orange Zone.

We have to be prepared for that amid this pandemic. We have received various ideas to tackle it including one to issue sanitisation certificates to hotels and lodges in and around popular tourist and pilgrimage sites.”Maharaj said, “The idea of issuing sanitisation certificates is being contemplated on the lines of Singapore where it has been implemented. The certificate will assure the visitors that the hotel is completely sanitised as per guidelines and is safe to stay.”The minister said such a measure was necessary because even after the lockdown ends, people will still be cautious because of the deadly virus. “We cannot adopt a lenient approach. We will have to be cautious even after the lockdown ends. The precautionary measures being taken now by the people in the ongoing pandemic are going to continue in the coming days also because of the deadly effect of the virus. We will have to be always very cautious without taking any risk as much as possible,” he said. The minister said whatever steps the government takes will be in line with the Centre’s guidelines.“A final decision is yet to be taken. Any step will be finalised while adhering to the Centre’s guidelines and approval of the government.”Earlier Sunday, chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat said that the state government could allow pilgrims from districts in the state’s green zone for Char-Dham yatra which includes the four highly revered shrines of Kedarnath, Badrinath, Gangotri and Yamunotri.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-may-give-sanitisation-certificates-to-hotels-for-safe-stay-post-lockdown/story-KsZ4JBBhUKBpYKhmGwUeMO.html

He called the establishment of IFSC in Gujarat as “egregious, erroneous and unwarranted”.In the scathing letter that he tweeted on Sunday, Pawar wrote, “It will also be perceived as a move to shift financial institutions and business houses away from Maharashtra and will create unnecessary political disturbances. It will not only cause financial damage to the country but also bring international discredit to it by undermining the importance of Mumbai.”He said that the Central government receives government securities (G-sec) to the tune of Rs 5.95 lakh crore from Maharashtra alone as against Gujarat’s contribution of Rs 1.40 lakh crore. He also said that Mumbai has been recognised as the world’s top ten centres of commerce. “If you see the general psyche of all business communities, bankers and other financial institutions, Mumbai is their natural choice for setting up such a unified authority. The Central government’s decision will be taken as an act of undermining the strategic importance of Mumbai that boasts as the Nation’s Financial Capital,” Pawar wrote. “Even the institutions across the world will be taken aback with this shocking decision,” he added.He also said that the Prime Minister must consider establishing IFSC in the financial capital of India i.e Mumbai. He further tweeted, “I expect Hon. @PMOIndia to take a rational, judicious decision keeping aside the state politics and consider it as an issue of utmost national importance.”The NCP chief’s reaction also comes a day after former Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said that it was the then Congress-NCP government which is to be blamed for this as it did not consider the option when it first came up in 2007. Fadnavis also claimed that the previous state government, during his tenure, had submitted a proposal to the Centre to allow functioning of two IFSCs in the country – in Mumbai and Gujarat – and added that it was still under consideration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sharad-pawar-writes-to-pm-modi-slams-centre-s-decision-to-shift-ifsc-from-mumbai/story-Wc79XDPRIPXTfMOBvTqTvI.html

According to a government notification, standalone shops selling non-essential items will operate in red zones.The containment zones in such areas, including Mumbai Metropolitan Region, Pune, Pimpri Chinchwad and Malegoan, will not get any of these relaxations, a decision that is in line with the central government’s Friday order.Construction activities in all red zone districts will be allowed, provided workers are available on site. The state will allow just five non-essential shops in each lane, according to news agency ANI. The numbers of essential shops are not restricted, it reported.According to a home ministry official, liquor shops will open across all three zones --- red, orange and green -- across India. But only standalone liquor shops will function; such shops in malls will continue to be closed. Shops selling liquor and tobacco products will ensure six-feet distance between two people and not allow more than five people at a time. Consumption of liquor, paan, gutka and tobacco in public places is not allowed.Also, in red zones, all malls and market complexes within city limits will be closed, but those selling essential items are exempt, according to the fresh federal guidelines on Friday. All standalone shops, neighbourhood shops and shops in residential complexes --- irrespective of whether they are selling essential or non-essential items --- are allowed, but social distancing is a must.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-relaxes-rules-liquor-shops-to-open-in-mumbai-pune/story-MNat6NOfRdwW4RepCzr1qO.html

Four have been moved out of the state for treatment.No case has been reported in the state in the last 10 days. Also, six out of 12 districts have reported no cases in the green zone.The state will be officially declared coronavirus-free if no new case is reported up to May 5.Initial cases and the surgeThe first two cases, a 32-year-old man and a 64-year-old woman, were from the Shahpur sub-division of Kangra, HP’s most populous district. Both had a travel history to an affected foreign country.The third case, a US-returned Tibetan man from McLeodganj in Dharamsala, who tested positive on March 23, died of acute respiratory distress in hospital.No fresh case was reported till the end of March, but on April 2 three Tablighi Jamaat workers from Una district who attended the Markaz at Delhi’s Nizamuddin tested positive. The situation seemed to be spiralling out of control as the number rose to 24 within a week with Una and Solan identified as hotspots.However, after the count reached 40 on April 23, no new case was reported.The responseThe state got into war mode the day it reported its first two cases, chief minister Jai Ram Thakur, who also holds the health portfolio, told the Hindustan Times. Though section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code prohibiting a gathering of more than four people was already in force in vulnerable pockets, a statewide curfew was imposed on March 23, a day before Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a countrywide lockdown.Schools and religious institutions had been closed earlier with hospitals only treating emergency cases.Six hospitals were designated for Covid-19 treatment, Thakur added. Rigorous contact mapping of all the positive cases was also done.A new challenge emerged when those with Jamaat links started testing positive. After a warning that all Markaz attendees disclose their status or face action, more than 1,000 such people and their primary contacts were quarantined.Strict vigil was maintained at the borders and anyone entering HP was kept in institutional quarantine for 28 days. Panchayati raj representatives were entrusted with the task to inform the authorities about anyone concealing information about outsiders in hiding.Authorities in HP shared contact numbers of their counterparts with people stranded outside the state who called the Himachal helpline number for help.Strict curbs were imposed on the movement of vehicles and persons even during curfew relaxation with a curfew e-pass system launched.Identifying casesThe health department adopted a three-pronged strategy, said director, National Health Mission (NHM) Nipun Jindal. It activated an integrated disease surveillance programme to strengthen and decentralise laboratories, allowing authorities to monitor the disease trend and response to the outbreak. Four labs conducted Covid-19 tests. Rapid response teams were pressed into service after years.The government also launched a massive active case finding campaign. More than 8,000 two-member teams moved door-to-door to screen people for influenza-like illness (ILI), connecting with about 70 lakh people.Of this, authorities identified 10,000 with ILI symptoms, who are now being tested for Covid-19.The strategy even found favour with PM Modi, who told other states to emulate the same.Testing was also ramped up due to 15 mobile sample collection vans. The authorities also arranged for home delivery of essential items including medicines, through 1,706 authorised shops and vendors, and were able to reach out to about 12.82 lakh people.Ration was also provided to migrant labourers and poor people with the help of various NGOs. Threat not overHowever, the war is not yet over, especially after HP opened its borders allowing residents stranded outside to return.More than 95,000 people were estimated to have entered the state in the last one week, with the situation again seeming to spiral out of control for three days as inter-state borders remained choked with thousands queuing up to cross the border.They have been ordered to self-quarantine for 28 days.As many entered without routine screening the government was forced to suspend more e-curfew passes. People entering the state now will be screened with the help of infrared scanners at the border.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/screening-population-strict-monitoring-of-disease-trends-helped-himachal-flatten-covid-19-curve/story-WODEaIYfhC6h3XLEDjn3pM.html

It is cheap medicine. — Lord Gordon ByronIn a world where everyone is caught in a rut to meet their goals and turn desires into reality, World Laughter Day comes as a reminder to take a break and ease the load. From some of the greatest poets, writers that the world has ever seen to the 21st-century business tycoons and billionaires - the world, from time to time, has come around to recognise the power of laughter and has always recommended it as one of the cheapest drugs to most things that plague the mind. Microsoft co-founder and billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates, in one of his heartfelt blog entries, shared how his friendship with Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffet - spanning over 2 decades now - has been all about “ learning and laughter”. Gates said that Warren has always helped do two things “that are impossible to overdo in one lifetime: learn more and laugh more”.Also read: Fight Covid-19 with 30 minutes of laughter every day“I’m always impatient for the plane doors to open because I know Warren will be waiting with a new story or a joke and I’ll be learning and laughing with him all over again,” Gates wrote in a blog piece in 2016. Breaking into a fit of laughter is one of the best and easiest ways to ease the stress temporarily and thus goes the popular saying, ‘laughter is the best medicine’. The benefits of laughter are many. It automatically infuses a sense of connection among people, almost instantly. Laughing can bust stress, relieve tension and scientifically speaking, it is known to boost brain activity, alleviate pain, improve mood and activate the stress response.Laughter is what comes to us naturally, instinctively. Nothing else is as pure and real as a good laugh, the easiest way to placate a troubled soul.  World Laughter Day was founded in the year 1998 by a Mumbai-based doctor, Madan Kataria, who was also the founder of the worldwide Laughter Yoga movement. The day dedicated to laughter is celebrated every year on May 3. Kataria was resolved to start a global laughter yoga movement based on the premise that facial expressions can affect human emotions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/world-laughter-day-2020-from-lord-byron-to-bill-gates-world-has-always-believed-in-power-of-a-good-laugh/story-8tOBYN0gvUIZ9pLQEFh3OM.html

03-05-2020||India||Firms fear 40% revenue decline in April-June quarter: CII snap poll||Two-thirds of Indian chief executive officers (CEOs) expect a 40% revenue decline in the quarter ending June 30 because of the nationwide shutdown for the coronavirus disease and its fallout, manifested by a lack of consumer demand, value chain and labour market disruptions as well as raw material shortages, according to a snap poll conducted by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII). More than half the CEOs foresee job losses after the lockdown ends, said the poll. Businesses have largely refrained from layoffs, but the hit suffered by their revenue streams has started causing financial distresses which would deepen if they remain shut longer, making job losses inevitable, the survey warned The respondents were mainly representatives of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), which have borne the brunt of the coronavirus outbreak and its after-effects on the economy. Forty-five percent of CEOs expect the economy to take more than a year to revive and 36% think the recovery will take six months to a year, the CII poll found. The CEOs want business operations to be resumed across districts including geographic zones worst hit by the Covid-19 pandemic, subject to strict safety protocols, so that the economy to return to track.“It is believed that the cost of prioritizing actions in such districts would be much smaller in comparison to the economic loss if these businesses have to remain shut,” CII said in its survey report, demanding that all industrial activities -- essential and non-essential -- be allowed to resume in all zones with strict health protocols in place.India came under the world’s biggest lockdown with effect from March 25 as the Narendra Modi government moved to stop the viral disease from spreading and enforced safe distancing measures, stopping industrial production, shutting commercial establishments, suspending air and rail transport, and taking public transport off the roads . The initial three-week emergency protocol was extended to 40 days until May 3, and by two more weeks until May 17, with a substantial easing of restrictions The lockdown has helped curb spread of Covid-19 and allowed time for India to build capacity to tackle a possible spurt in cases, CII said adding that it, however, had also started building pressure on businesses cutting across a large swathe, impairing economic growth prospects.Economic growth this financial year is forecast by the International Monetary Fund to slump to 1.9%, the slowest pace in three decades.CII proposed identifying districts to restart businesses on the basis of the concentration of industrial and economic activities. “This could be done as per the district’s contribution to the state/country’s GDP [gross domestic products] or industrial estates and clusters or number of enterprises registered in a district,” it said.“The top 100-150 districts so identified should be specially monitored and provided special attention in containment of the disease and restart of the economic/business operations,” it added.CII suggested that districts deemed to be pivotal to the economy be allowed additional relaxations that will permit industrial clusters and standalone production facilities, including those not designated as industrial estates, special economic zones (SEZs) or industrial townships, to operate. The government’s May 1 notification has permitted industrial estates, SEZs and industrial townships with restricted entry in so-called red zones, or hotspot districts, to commence operations.“The third phase of lockdown necessitates a focused strategy to minimize economic contraction due to Covid-19, without compromising on efforts to control the contagion,” CII said. Aggressive measures are required to ensure that an industrial district moves from red to orange (areas with a limited number of Covid-19 cases) and green (areas free of the virus) within 21 days, it said.“The cost of undertaking precautionary measures by way of repeated sanitation, wearing of PPE [personal protection equipment], masks, monitoring, group testing etc. will be much less than the economic loss if businesses in such high performing districts have to remain shut for longer duration,” said Chandrajit Banerjee, director general of CII.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/firms-fear-40-revenue-decline-in-april-june-quarter-cii-snap-poll/story-uMpBmJx8vkoPPawJs3KxJL.html
03-05-2020||India||India tried to persuade Pak through back channel to release Kulbhushan: Harish Salve||India had hoped it might be able to persuade Pakistan through “back channel” to release retired Indian Navy officer Kulbhushan Jadhav, who was sentenced to death by a Pakistan military court on charges of “espionage and terrorism” in 2017, senior advocate Harish Salve has said.Salve was the lead counsel for India in the Jadhav case at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) which had last year ruled that Pakistan must review the death sentence awarded to the retired naval officer after a closed trial. During an online lecture series organised by the Akhil Bharatiya Adhivakta Parishad, affiliated to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) on Saturday, Salve from London said the Indian side has kept on asking how do Pakistan propose to carry out the ICJ judgement and give effective review and reconsideration, but no answer has been forthcoming.“We were hoping that through back channel, we may be able to persuade Pakistan to let him go. If they want to say on humanitarian ground or whatever, we want him back. We said let him go. Because it has become a big ego problem in Pakistan. So, we were hoping that they will let him go. They haven’t,” he said, while answering a question on the current situation in the matter. “We have written four-five letters. They just keep on denying,” he said. “I think we have reached a point where we have to now decide whether we want to go back to ICJ for consequential directions because Pakistan has not moved ahead.” Salve said that following the ICJ order, Pakistan had granted consular access but it was too late and “we have now been in a tussle with Pakistan to get them to set up machinery.” “Pakistan believes, first of all they told the whole world they have won the case, good for them. And now, they keep saying that you have to file a proceeding in a Pakistani court or take Pakistani proceedings,” he said. “We keep saying how you propose to carry out the judgement of ICJ and give effective review and reconsideration. They refuse to answer that question. We have had exchanges backward and forward. I think the Government of India has been writing to them and who knows the way things are going, we may have to go back in the ICJ someday, trying to get justice for Jadhav,” Salve said. He said till date, Pakistan has refused to share the case details such as the FIR, the chargesheet or the judgement of the military court in the matter. Responding to a question about the alleged offensive languages used by lawyer representing Pakistan at the ICJ, Salve said the Pakistan’s lawyer had used very “strong language” against India. “In the ICJ, we never used words like these. I did the word check and worlds like disgusting, lying and dishonest have been used by Pakistan many times,” he said. Salve said that he did not want to stoop to the Pakistan’s level as Indian traditions did not allow him to use such bad words and, moreover, he respected the ICJ and its portal. Salve then referred to a statement of a registrar of the ICJ made to the Indian ambassador during a function. “He (registrar) said that there was so much heat in this case.” Salve recalled, adding that he said that the America-Iran sanction case was important one, but that was done peacefully. Sharing the experience about the hearing in the Jadhav case, he said that by the time of rejoinder argument, the Pakistan lawyer was apologetic for the language used. “We are keeping this case under the glare of the international community in the hope that Pakistan does not do what it does,” he said in response to a question as to how to save Jadhav from the fate meted out to Sarabjit Singh in a Pakistan jail. Sarabjit, who was convicted for alleged involvement in bomb attacks in Pakistan’s Punjab province in 1990, was brutally attacked by inmates in the Kot Lakhpat Jail and had died in a hospital in the country. Salve, while addressing the lawyers, gave the background of Jadhav’s case and said he is the ex-navy commander and his case is that he carries out business in Iran and one day he was kidnapped. “He was handed over by the Taliban to the Pakistan Army. The fact that he was seized by the Pakistan Army at the Pakistan border with Iran is an admitted fact. Of course Pakistan does not admit that he was kidnapped by the Taliban. There is no clarity. There has been no clarity in Pakistan’s case as to how they nabbed him,” Salve said. “Their case generally is that they caught him trying to infiltrate Pakistan at the Pakistan-Iran border at the place called Chhabahar. That’s where they caught him,” he said. Salve added that before Pakistan informed India about Jadhav’s arrest, they had made his confession global. “The confession makes an interesting reading. It is a very general kind of confession saying that I have been a bad boy. I have indulged in terrorism activities in this place and that place and on behalf of India. I have done lot of bad things in Pakistan. No details, no dates, no incidents mentioned, no specific incidents mentioned. They claim that on basis of this, he was then sent to trial, he was given an Army officer, as a lawyer to represent him. They claim he was tried,” he said. Pakistan has claimed that Jadhav was arrested on March 3, 2016 and India was informed on March 25, 2016, when its Foreign Secretary raised the matter with the Indian consulate in Islamabad. Jadhav was sentenced to death on charges of espionage and terrorism in April 2017 by the Army court. India had moved the ICJ against the Pakistan Army court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-tried-to-persuade-pak-through-back-channel-to-release-kulbhushan-harish-salve/story-qW5cdNgX9ZXAT9N9xLjCrL.html
03-05-2020||India||Man tries to track 2 missing packets of snacks online, loses Rs 2.22 lakh||A 40-year-old businessman who had ordered some food material online called on a fake helpline number of the company, which he found on a widely used search engine, to enquire about two bhujiya packets worth Rs 400 that he had ordered but not received, and ended up losing Rs 2.25 lakh after sharing his bank details, cyber police officials said.A FIR was registered on Saturday in connection with the fraud. “There has been a spurt in such cases and fraudsters are adopting new modus operandi to dupe people during lockdown. People need to be careful. We keep issuing advisories and also create awareness through our Twitter handle,” Harish Baijal, Deputy Inspector General of state cyber police said.According to Borivali police, the complainant approached them on May 2 and lodged a FIR. On April 22, he had ordered online grocery from an online grocery website. While he received all the material he did not get two bhujiya packets worth Rs 400. The businessman on May 1 searched for the helpline number of the grocery website on Google and got a fake helpline number uploaded by the cyber-fraudster. The fraudster asked the businessman to give his bank account number, registered mobile number and the three digit CVV of his ATM card. The fraudster then sent him a link on his mobile phone and asked him to forward it to another mobile number. He then asked the complainant to pass on his UPI pin and the subsequent OTP received on his mobile number. The businessman gave his UPI pin as well as the OTP and within two hours in four transactions a total of Rs 2.25 lakh was withdrawn. Explaining how the crime was executed, Ritesh Bhatia, a cyber crime investigator said, “The fraudster was successful in setting up the UPI account on his device by managing to convince the victim to share all his sensitive banking details including CVV, UPI pin and OTP. The fraudster also had the card details and hence was successful in wiping away such a large amount within seconds. It’s surprising to know that people still don’t hesitate to share OTPs and CVV numbers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-tries-to-track-2-missing-packets-of-snacks-online-loses-rs-2-22-lakh/story-Q1hBXnPHUW8Xw212qNxQYO.html

So, we will lose that, if we abruptly end it,” he said.Paul, who is heading an Empowered Group on medical equipment and management plan to tackle coronavirus outbreak, said that at the same time where situation is good, the opening will take place with caution and care.Replying to a question that whether India has slipped into community transmission stage, he said, “Essentially, we think it (continuous rise in coronavirus cases) is still amenable to containment strategy”.He also noted that India is nowhere close to the kind of escalation of coronavirus cases that it witnessed during the pre-lockdown phase.“In the pre-lockdown stage, we were doubling our number of cases in every five days. Before that even at every 3 days. Now, we are doubling in 11-12 days.“So, overall the rate of spread has diminished but yes the number still has not stabilised. But we expect it to stabilise anytime soon,” the Niti Aayog member said.The death toll due to Covid-19 rose to 1,301 and the number of cases climbed to 39,980 in the country on Sunday, according to the Union Health Ministry.The Centre has extended the lockdown by two more weeks after May 3, when the second phase of these restrictions was scheduled to end.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had first announced a 21-day nationwide lockdown from March 25, which was later extended by two more weeks to contain the virus spread.However, several experts have cautioned that the lockdown is severely impacting the economy and many rating agencies and industry bodies have forecast a sharp dip in the country’s economic growth rate for the current fiscal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rise-in-india-s-coronavirus-cases-expected-to-stabilise-anytime-soon-niti-aayog-member-vk-paul/story-YpkqmDnTPseQG140uB4SSM.html

AarogyaSetuMitr, the stack powering this new feature, is developed in collaboration & partnership of @NITIAayog and @PrinSciAdvGoI,” said the first of the two tweets by Kant.The app developed by the ministry of electronics and information technology was first launched on April 2 and it was initially promoted by the government for voluntary use, pitched as a device meant for advance warning the user and the authorities, in case of contact with a Covid 19 infected person or a suspect. The app uses cellular location mapping technology and Bluetooth to track users and their movements.Later, the government promoted the app as a tool among several others employed for coronavirus containment efforts and the prime minister himself vigorously stressed on the need for its mass use to increase its efficacy.The app’s formal induction as a containment tool was completed on May 1, when the government made its use mandatory for people in containment zones and for office goers, which led to questions around data protection and privacy raised by the opposition parties and also some experts. While Rahul Gandhi called it a “sophisticated surveillance tool” being controlled by a “private operator”, the ruling party slammed the criticism as motivated and ill-informed.Also Read: Rahul Gandhi leads opposition charge on Aarogya SetuAccording to Kant, the app has now been scaled up further in partnership with the NITI Aayog and the Principal Scientific Advisor to the government of India, to provide online medical consultation, online pharmacy and laboratory tests at home.

Many more, who are still admitted in hospitals, “are on the road to recovery,” he said as reported by news agency ANI. The health minister said that the doubling rate of Covid-19 cases in the country is around 12 days today as compared to 10.5 days in the last 14 days. “Our mortality rate of 3.2% is the lowest in the world,” Dr Vardhan said.  Today more than 10,000 COVID19 patients have been discharged.

With over 3% of fatality ratio, India’s Covid-19 mortality rate is among the lowest in the world. Also read: How does Covid-19 mortality rate differ across countriesJohns Hopkins University suggests coronavirus-affected countries across the globe have reported very different “case fatality ratios”. The ratio is the number of deaths divided by the number of confirmed cases.The University states that the number of fatalities can differ across regions owing to the following factors:- Differences in the number of people tested: With more testing, more people with milder cases are identified. This lowers the case-fatality ratio.- Demographics: For example, mortality tends to be higher in older populations.- Characteristics of the healthcare system: For example, mortality may rise as hospitals become overwhelmed and have fewer resources, among other factors. “Countries at the top of the figure have the most deaths proportionally to their Covid-19 cases or population, not necessarily the most deaths overall,” it says.According to the data, Belgium tops the list of countries with highest Covid-19 fatality ratio with 15% Covid-19 mortality rate.

03-05-2020||India||Lockdown: 6 migrant workers from Odisha among 8 injured in bus accidents on way back home||Eight people, including six migrant workers on their way back to Odisha, were injured in two separate bus accidents in Maharashtra and Odisha on Sunday. Five people, including two minors and two bus staff, were injured when the bus ferrying them from Surat in Gujarat fell in a roadside ditch on the Nagpur-Amravati National Highway in Maharashtra on Sunday morning. The bus, with 50 Odia migrant workers, had left Surat on Friday.The injured, admitted to the Karanja hospital in Maharashtra for treatment, will be brought to Odisha later in another bus along with the other passengers. In the second incident, another bus carrying 50 migrant workers from Surat to Ganjam, hit a roadside kerb at Kalinga Ghati hilly road, leaving three people injured. This is the second accident on this road. On Saturday evening, two migrant workers returning from Surat to their homes in Ganjam district were killed and a few others were injured when the bus carrying them swerved off at the same Kalinga Ghati road in Kandhamal district and dashed against roadside kerb. The two deceased were thrown off the vehicle. In a separate incident, another migrant worker died in a bus on Saturday while he was on his way back home in Odisha’s Ganjam district. The man had been unwell for some time. When the bus carrying him and others from Surat entered Raipur in Chhatisgarh, he was found unconscious. He was rushed to hospital where doctors declared him dead.Odisha’s transport minister Padmanabha Behera said the mishaps seem to be occurring due to reckless driving and lack of enough knowledge about driving in hilly roads. Behera said the drivers would be asked not to drive the buses beyond 40 kmph on those roads.Meanwhile, the number of positive cases in the state climbed to 160 as Ganjam district reported its first cases with two migrant workers from Surat testing positive for Covid-19. A 17-year-old male and 22-year-old male who had returned from Surat a day earlier were found positive, but without any symptoms. The state government has prepared close to 3 lakh quarantine beds for the migrant workers returning from other States.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lockdown-6-migrant-workers-from-odisha-among-8-injured-in-bus-accidents-on-way-back-home/story-SlHn5tmY2uvtrm1w8wGuYL.html

Technology can help keep us safe; but fear must not be leveraged to track citizens without their consent,” Gandhi tweeted. IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad called Gandhi’s accusation a lie and said the app not outsourced to a private operator. “Daily a new lie. Aarogya Setu is a powerful companion which protects people. It has a robust data security architecture. Those who indulged in surveillance all their lives, won’t know how tech can be leveraged for good,” Prasad tweeted in response to Gandhi’s tweets. The app, launched by the government on April 2 to contact-trace people affected by the coronavirus, has now been expanded to host several functions. It now uses location data to identify potential hotspots, integrates the e-pass of different states, in addition to health information and telemedicine facilities. Some privacy experts and opposition leaders have raised concerns on the app’s mandate. AIMIM leader Assaduddin Owaisi on Friday said the app is “very shady”. “Now Delhi’s Sultans have issued a ‘farmaan’(edict) that people have no choice in the matter. They must share their private data with the government,” tweeted Owaisi.Reacting to it, I&B minister Prakash Javadekar said that such data is being used worldwide, and the app will continue to remain relevant for the next 1-2 years. “It curbs false information and you also know if there is a Covid-19 positive person in your vicinity,” said Javadekar.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesBJP leader Sambit Patra said that Gandhi is ignorant about the Aarogya Setu and is trying to mislead people through misinformation. “The government on multiple occasions has allayed the fears of surveillance and that too scientifically. The said app is a technical personal bodyguard to each one of us in the fight against Covid-19. Congress should refrain from using the pandemic as a political opportunity,” Patra said.

We have not been given any fresh sample for examination after we filed our report on those 105 deaths,” the committee member told PTI.According to the panelist, the principle objective of the committee is to study the death of Covid-19 patients and find out more about the character of the virus.“There are several questions in the mind of the common people about the disease. As there is no study or database in this regard, the government wanted set up a treatment and containment protocol to understand the symptoms... and how that kept changing from the preliminary to aggravated stage.“And in case of deaths, how many days did the virus take to reach that stage when the infected person finally succumbs,” he explained.The panel, he said, has formed a list of dos and don’ts for medical practitioners treating novel coronavirus cases and certifying deaths.“We analysed, researched and formed a list of recommendations for the doctors to treat and certify deaths because of Covid-19,” the member said.The committee will now on collect samples from hospitals for examination, and will give necessary suggestions to the health department, if there are new findings.“This panel will not certify any coronavirus-related death. We will now go for random collection of samples from hospitals. In case of any new or peculiar finding, we will inform the state health department and make our recommendations,” he said.The panel had earlier noted that there was scope for improvement in medical record-keeping at Covid-19 hospitals, following which Chief Secretary Rajiva Sinha said the health department would soon issue an advisory.“During our research we found that the death certificates were issued without following the norms set by the WHO and the ICMR for Covid-19 deaths. Those certificates should have included the immediate cause of death, antecedent cause of death and underlying cause of death. The medical record-keeping requires uniformity and that’s the responsibility of hospital authorities,” the panelist said.An advisory, once issued by the government, will definitely help hospitals in understanding the character of the disease and how to deal with it, he said.West Bengal has registered 48 deaths due to Covid-19.The total number of people infected by Covid-19 in West Bengal stands at 886. Of them, 624 are active cases and 199 have recovered. The Union Health ministry has put the figure at 922.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/audit-panel-in-bengal-to-deal-with-only-peculiar-covid-19-cases-says-senior-member/story-S8n2oyN5JgFGBJKxQumzHJ.html

03-05-2020||India||Coronavirus latest update: 39,980 cases hide a success story of India’s Covid-19 fight||The Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) on Sunday highlighted India’s relative success in the containing coronavirus outbreak by claiming the country had the least number of positive Covid-19 cases among countries that had conducted one million tests. India crossed that milestone on Saturday, thanks to a continuous up-gradation in its testing capacity.As on Sunday, India had registered a total of 39,980 positive cases of the virus, which was about half of the cases registered in Germany, one-third of cases in Turkey, one-fourth of Italy and the USA and nearly one-fifth of Spain, when these countries completed one million RT- PCR tests.According to a bar graph reportedly compiled using ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research) data, Germany had 73,522 positive cases on the day it completed 1 million RT-PCR tests. Germany is one of the few countries with a high infection rate but a low mortality rate from the virus.Other major countries like Turkey (117,589), Italy (152,271), USA (164,620) and Spain (200,194) have even worse figures of total infections per million tests.The comparison suggests that the rate of spread of coronavirus in India was far less than the above-listed countries that are amongst the worst affected in the world. While the BJP didn’t specify any reason for this, the government has often credited nationwide lockdown, suspension of international and intra-national travel and other restrictions for slowing down the growth rate of the virus in the country.India has steadily ramped up its testing capacity from 5,580 a day on April 1 to 74,507 samples on May 2. The health ministry expects to cross 100,000 tests a day by the next week. The number of labs in the country conducting Covid-19 tests has gone up to 406, including 105 private facilities.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19In terms of population, India has conducted almost 783 tests per million. This ratio continues to be on the lower side since other countries with far less population have a better score on this count. Germany has done 30,400 tests per million, Turkey has done 13,177 tests per million, Italy has done 34,879 tests per million, USA has done 20,940 tests per million and Spain has done 32,699 tests per million as of Sunday. India has the lowest tests/million of population among the top 20 countries worst affected by the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-latest-update-39-980-cases-hide-a-success-story-of-india-s-covid-19-fight/story-GC6NZbAYckWgfU1Ch8t1VO.html

Since the day the lockdown was announced and inter-state transport stopped, around 9000 migrants from different districts of Odisha working in Kerala’s Ernakulam district had been exploring ways to travel back to their homeland. While in neighbouring Tamil Nadu around 100 fishermen had taken the sea route to come back to Odisha, the migrants in Kerala did not take that risk.Operation SubhayatraThe process to bring back the labourers started on April 30 after the Union ministry of home affairs (MHA) allowed the transportation of stranded people across the country. Officials in Kerala’s Ernakulam district launched Operation Subhayatra and authorities held a meeting of officials of the police, transport and health departments, including the National Health Mission, as well as railway personnel.“We already had the data of all the guest workers (migrant workers) police station wise and camp wise. The problem was how to stop more people from travelling as the train could take not more than 1140 passengers after adhering to the social distance guidelines,” Karthik Kannan, Ernakulam Rural district’s superintendent of police, said. Kannan said they decided to pick people from a camp in Perumbavoor, a historic town in Ernakulam with 40000 workers from Bengal, Odisha and Assam, on May 1 but were confronted with the problem of possible agitation by other workers who may not be selected. “To deal with the problem, we took nine BSF (Border Security Force) persons along with home guards with knowledge of Assamese, Odia and Bengali languages to the camps to persuade them that it is impossible to send everyone at one go. But we assured them that everyone will go in phases,” he said.Choosing passengersWhile a decision was taken to transport the 1140 migrant workers, the problem was to choose who will travel first.“We decided to give priority to women and children and people with family. After that old people were given priority. We also gave priority to people who had some urgency at their home and needed travelling immediately,” the senior police official said.Kannan said as only people with no Covid-19 symptoms could travel, a dozen team each comprising health, police and revenue officials screened the workers and registered for their onward journey to Odisha. “Each of the people who were to board the train was given a medical certificate that they not showing any Covid symptoms,” he said.In Bhubaneswar, officials at the Covid-19 control room then checked whether all of them have pre-registered themselves with the Covid-19 portal, a necessity for all migrant workers before they set foot in Odisha.“When we cross-checked the details with our portal for registration of those who wanted to return, we found all of them had registered,” Manoj Mishra, Odisha’s IT secretary, said. Journey homeEach of the returning migrant workers was stamped with indelible ink indicating their quarantine period on their inner side of the right forearm. They were then taken in Kerala State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) buses to the Aluva railway station where each of the 23 coaches was allowed to be filled by 54 people as against capacity for 72 passengers following the social distancing norms. Each of them paid a base fare of Rs 530. The revenue department then loaded 6000 litres of drinking water, 2400 food packets with chapati, biscuits and banana, which were picked up by each of the migrant workers. The train also stopped at Duvvada in Andhra Pradesh for a few minutes for loading of cooked food.The train carrying the migrant workers from Ernakulam district reached Khurda Road railway station near Bhubaneswar on Sunday morning and then Jagannathpur railway station in Ganjam a couple of hours later. After they reached Odisha travelling a little more than 55 hours, the migrant workers were screened for any rise in body temperature before they were taken to their respective districts by waiting buses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-odisha-migrant-workers-in-kerala-were-chosen-brought-home-in-special-trains/story-GWZ9zIsB22UwNfFOxc79MN.html

Chhattisgarh state is also fighting this pandemic courageously and has succeeded to a great extent in controlling the infection, he said.“Presently, a large number of labourers from Chhattisgarh is stranded in various parts of the country. Based on the information received from helpline and other sources, nearly 1.17 lakh labourers of the state are stranded in 21 states and four union territories of the country,” Bhupesh Baghel wrote.“After the transport facility is resumed, this number is expected to increase. And if we add the number of people apart from labourers, such as students, tourists etc, this number already escalates significantly,” he said.As he welcomed the Centre’s decision to run the special trains for labourers stranded in other places, Baghel also requested to run these trains free of cost on humanitarian grounds.“The letter issued by the Railway Board on May 1 states that fares have been decided for sleeper mail and express trains. This is not fair as the labourers and people stuck in other states are already distressed. They should be provided with this facility by the railways free of cost,” he wrote.The chief minister said the state’s administrative system has been directed to coordinate with various states and chalk out an action plan for safe home-coming of labourers and other people stranded there. “I request you to operate a sufficient number of trains for home-coming of labourers and citizens of Chhattisgarh in other states,” he said.Baghel requested for seven trains from Jammu to Raipur-Bilaspur, three trains from Lucknow to Raipur-Bilaspur, two trains from Kanpur to Raipur-Bilaspur, one train from Chennai to Raipur-Bilaspur, one train from Bangalore to Raipur-Bilaspur, two trains from Pune to Raipur-Bilaspur and one train from Allahabad to Bilaspur.He also asked for three trains from Delhi to Raipur-Bilaspur, three trains from Hyderabad-Secunderabad to Raipur-Bilaspur, one train from Vishakhapatnam to Raipur, from Surat-Ahmedabad to Raipur, one train from Kolkata to Raipur, one train from Jaipur to Raipur and one train from Patna to Durg, in his letter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-cm-writes-to-railways-minister-piyush-goyal-demanding-28-trains-for-migrant-workers/story-WuRhjNwHPko7STKcK6zHcI.html

03-05-2020||India||Three new species of little horned frogs discovered in North-East India||A team of Indian and Irish biologists from Delhi University, University College Dublin and the Natural History Museum (UK) have discovered three new species of horned frogs from the jungles of North-East India.The findings, published on April 28, 2020, in the Journal of Natural History, is the result of fourteen years of research and seven years of fieldwork.“This study is a testament to how little is known about the most threatened animal group, frogs, in northeastern India,” Stephen Mahony, the lead author of the paper, said in a statement.“Our work has completely changed what we thought we knew about these secretive animals, from how to identify the different species and how they are related to each other, to where they live and how vulnerable they may be to deforestation,” he added. Also read: African swine fever detected in pigs in Assam and Arunachal PradeshThe scientists named two of the new species using words adapted from local tribal languages at their sites of discovery.The Naga Hills Horned Frog (Megophrys awuh­­), where the word “awuh” means “frog” in the Pochury language, the primary native tribe from the Melluri district of Nagaland.The Tamenglong Horned Frog (Megophrys numhbumaeng), where the name is derived from ‘nwmbwmaeng’ meaning “forest spirit” from the Rongmei (Ruangmei) language, the primary native tribe from the Tamenglong district of Manipur state.The third new species, the Dzükou Valley Horned Frog (Megophrys dzukou), was named after the only place where this potentially endangered new species was found. The location lies on the border of Nagaland and Manipur. The discovery was made when the biologists were investigating a group of small species of horned frogs from the North-East. Horned frogs are so named for their fleshy, horn-like, projection on the upper eyelids of some species.“North-East India is part of globally recognised biodiversity hotspots. Yet, the amphibian fauna of this region has been overlooked for far too long. Many such surprises are still waiting to be uncovered with respect to the incredible frog diversity of the North-East,” SD Biju, Professor at Delhi University said. With the new discoveries, 11 new species of horned frog have been named from North-East India following research by the same core team published in 2011, 2013, and 2018 (which included the 11 cm Giant Himalayan Horned Frog).“I grew up personally witnessing the rapid changes in North-East landscapes and jungles disappearing with shocking speed. Frogs are very vital for healthy ecosystems but incredibly many Nagas still consider them as tasty snacks.” Rachunliu G Kamei, one of the authors involved in the research, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/three-new-species-of-little-horned-frogs-discovered-in-northeast-india/story-K0i9jSw4IMcmA8cgQNHBgI.html

Five ‘Shramik Express’ trains were on track on Friday, 10 ran on Saturday due to the screening process necessitated by the coronavirus pandemic and logistics. The remaining trains will run on Sunday, officials said.• These trains mostly have 24 coaches. Each of these coaches can accommodate 72 passengers but only 54 are being allowed due to social distancing norms. The total number of passengers travelling should be around 1200 per train, the railways said.• The railways has directed states to collect fares from passengers cleared to travel in these trains. The fare includes the price of regular sleeper class tickets plus superfast charges of Rs 30 and an additional charge of Rs 20. The railways ministry has said that state governments can pay the fare on passengers’ behalf.• The railways will provide only one meal for trains longer than 12 hours. It has asked the state governments to provide food packets and water to the passengers at originating stations. The states have also been asked to encourage passengers to download the Arogya Setu app for checking the health status of the passengers.• In Maharashtra, the worst affected state by the coronavirus pandemic, Mumbai is not an originating station due to the high number of Covid-19 positive cases. Trains are being run from other destinations like Bhiwandi and Vasai in Maharashtra. These trains are unlikely to run from containment zones, which include almost all metro cities.• The railways has maintained secrecy about the movement of these special trains. Except the names of originating and destination states, no other details have been officially shared. These trains are non-stop, bound for a single destination.• Jharkhand, which has requested 31 trains, tops the list of states who have reached out to the national transporter to help migrants return home. It has paid the railways in advance for its services, said officials.• Railways reserves the right to discontinue ‘Shramik Express’ trains if safety protocols are flouted at any stage, the ministry has said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/54-passengers-per-coach-non-stop-run-all-you-need-to-know-about-shramik-express-trains/story-WZqYPHBYXQCCFx4G753N3O.html

03-05-2020||India||Railways asks states to collect fares from Shramik Special passengers||State authorities shall collect fares after distributing tickets among stranded migrants and students who are boarding special trains to return to their hometowns, and hand over the amount to the Indian Railways, the railways ministry said in fresh guidelines on Sunday.After allowing the running of the Shramik Special trains on Friday, the railways said it will charge sleeper class fares and an additional Rs 50 for one point-to-point journey, while it also added that states can coordinate and pay on passengers’ behalf.The railways shall print train tickets to specified destinations on the basis of the number of passengers indicated by an originating state, and give the tickets to the local government authority. “The local state government authority shall hand over the tickets to the passengers cleared by them and collect the ticket fare and hand over the total amount to the railways,” the fresh guidelines said.The railways also said these trains were being run only for those who have been identified and allowed to travel by the states sending and receiving them, and not for the general public. The railways reserves the right to discontinue the special train operations if safety protocols are flouted at any stage, the ministry said.“The originating state will inform the exact number of passengers travelling in a train, which should be 1200 (or at least 90%) considering the capacity…,” the guidelines said.The move to charge fares for these trains ferrying migrants --- many of them have lost their jobs --- students and others stranded in different parts of the country due to the ongoing lockdown has met with opposition.Rajasthan deputy chief minister and state Congress president Sachin Pilot said on Sunday the central government should bear the expenses. “They have no earnings. In such a situation, they should not be charged fares…,” he said.On Saturday, Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren said the government should roll back the fare for these special trains, adding that it was an “injustice to our labourers who are returning home”.Shramik Special trains are bound for a single destination without any stoppages. Usually, they have 24 coaches with each carrying a little over 50 in place of the total capacity of 72. These trains will run for distances of over 500 km.“We have informed that trains will not be stopping at any station in the middle, and states must make it clear to the passengers as there have been incidents where they thought they could get off…,” an official said on the condition of anonymity. The guidelines also said local authorities will give food packets and drinking water to passengers at the originating station. The railways will provide one meal on the train for a journey of over 12 hours.The railways ministry also asked states to encourage passengers to download the Aarogya Setu app for checking the health status of passengers.It will also be the responsibility of the governments sending people to bring such individuals to designated stations in sanitized buses, following social distancing norms. All passengers will have to mandatorily wear masks. Passengers will have to be screened by the sending states and only those found without symptoms of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) will be allowed to travel.States are also scrambling to arrange payments for the railways in order to ensure the running of these trains to bring their residents back home. Jharkhand is one of the few that has made an advance payment to the railways for deploying 31 special trains, according to officials aware of the developments.Five Shramik Special trains were run on Friday and 10 on Saturday. According to officials, railways is unlikely to run trains originating from red zones such as Delhi, Mumbai and Ahmedabad, at least for now.“There are no trains planned for now, but we are running (trains) in nearby places…like in Maharashtra trains, are being run at Bhiwandi and Vasai…Trains will only run to these places (red zones) when the demand from the state government comes,” said the official quoted above||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/railways-asks-states-to-collect-shramik-special-fares/story-MXp4B9RIM49F1MIsVrVTaJ.html
03-05-2020||India||Goa food bank is ensuring no one goes hungry during Covid-19 lockdown||The Covid-19 lockdown and shuttering of Goa’s tourism industry has brought an eerie silence across the once crowded beaches of North Goa.While some rejoiced at Goa’s apparent return to past natural glory, and tourism operators are left wondering what fate has befallen on them, for Donald Fernandes it posed a different kind of problem.Street Providence Trust, a Food Bank Service that Fernandes and several volunteers run to help feed the poor, homeless and others in need found itself without its main source of food - the hotel and restaurant businesses - at a time when he needed it the most.Left with mouths to feed spread across eight destitute homes that are being managed by the charitable organisation, and a full lockdown in force in Goa during the initial days that covered even the sale of essential items, Fernandes was at his wits’ end trying to arrange for supplies.“On a normal day I used to receive around 1,500-2,000 kgs of food cooked from hotels and restaurants that would otherwise go to waste. This used to be distributed to around 5,000-6,000 people through the food bank that we run. When the lockdown came in force, there was no way to source food even for the 100-odd people that we were housing at our destitute homes,” Fernandes recalled. But Fernandes’ organisation quickly shifted gears and expanded its operations and reach to distribute cooked food to those who were going hungry. Thankfully for him, donors pitched in both and cash started flowing in. A bunch of volunteers began cooking the food themselves to be distributed across the state, including among labourers who were out of work and without food. A caterer pitched in with 16 sacks of rice, three sacks of atta (flour) besides other stocks and help began coming in from other sources too. A bakery began offering 1,800 packets of sliced bread a day, and with restaurant kitchens being allowed to open, restaurants too offered to cook food to be distributed to the needy through the Street Providence network.“It is unbelievable how many people including local Goans who are living on a hand to mouth basis. Many of whom have been working for industries and establishments that are now shut and are not going to open,” Fernandes says. Fernandes and a few volunteers started Street Providence to function as a food bank three years ago with a view to act as a bridge between food that was being wasted by the hotel industry and those going hungry in Goa. In its initial days, Street Providence set up a network of fridges and freezers where leftover food from parties and restaurants was collected and stored. Fernandes started the food bank as “thanksgiving for having been blessed with a second child after a gap of seven long years” and began initially cooking food for around 50 families in the vicinity before expanding into a full fledged food bank. With his network now geared up to the new normal, Fernandes is now preparing to be ready to be serving his expanded list of dependents right up to September through the lean monsoon months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-food-bank-is-ensuring-no-one-goes-hungry-during-covid-19-lockdown/story-Gbfkje2FDi4yf7QIoKcY6H.html

At a review meeting on Covid-19 lockdown and movement of people on Saturday, Gehlot said that there should be no negligence, else entire efforts will go waste.“The third phase of lockdown will begin from May 4. The guideline issued by the GoI and state should be strictly followed. There should not be any kind of negligence on social distancing and necessary arrangements should be made for the industrial activities, which have been allowed to commence in the third phase,” said Gehlot.He added that institutional quarantine has been arranged for migrants and workers from other states to prevent the spread of infection, but those who do not want to use it must necessarily stay in home quarantine. Also, their families should cater for social distancing and should not go out of the houses, the chief minister said.He said that screening of all passengers should be ensured along with sanitisation of trains and buses. All other arrangements, including masks, sanitisers, food, should also be available for them, Gehlot added.Gehlot said that till date, around 14 lakh people have registered for movement and it is a big challenge to send them to their respective homes. “These people should be called about 4 to 6 hours before the departure of a train by giving timely information related to the schedule and fare of the train through SMS, to avoid rush,” Gehlot said at the meeting. He also said that social distancing norms should be followed in trains too.Chief Secretary DB Gupta informed that constant communication and coordination is being done with the state governments regarding the movement of migrants and workers. He said that Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Telangana and West Bengal have not agreed to take people other than the workers currently living in the camps. Therefore, it is not possible to send people of these states. We are making efforts that governments of these states provide consent soon, said Gupta.Additional Chief Secretary Industries Subodh Agrawal informed that 45,287 workers and migrants have been sent from the state till Saturday and 57,521 workers and migrants have been brought to the state. Ensuring social distancing, around 1,200 passengers have been transported in a train.

And this crime has been done by those associated with the Tablighi Jamaat.He also said that if those who attended the Jamaat congregation in Delhi last month had revealed about the disease, the state government would have controlled the coronavirus outbreak to a large extent.The chief minister said that action would be taken against them for the “crime that they have committed”.At least 16,500 people visited Jamaat’s headquarters in Nizamuddin between March 13 and 24, according to a Delhi police report that has been compiled after the biggest exercise the force has ever undertaken.A Delhi government official, who did not wish to be named, said around 1,000 people from outside Delhi had come for the gathering.Over the last four weeks, police have checked call details and the locations of all the 16,500 people and found that they had come in close contact with around 15,000. While some stayed at the markaz (centre), others left and visited different places of Delhi.Tablighi Jamaat head Maulana Saad and six other functionaries of the group have been named in a First Information Report (FIR) for organising a religious gathering at the markaz despite restrictions on such congregations to check the Covid-19 spread.The markaz has been linked to infections in at least 17 states and Union territories, according to Union health ministry data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hiding-a-disease-is-a-crime-yogi-adityanath-condemns-role-of-tablighi-jamaat-in-covid-19/story-2HZO2fmPJF1BYBzKxmk9SM.html

03-05-2020||India||Eye on Gulf countries, Pak ups Twitter campaign to target India over ‘Islamophobia’||Indian security agencies have identified nearly 7,000 accounts on micro-blogging site Twitter that were opened in April 2020 and are being operated from Pakistan, a report submitted to the government this week has said. These social media handles, the report said, had launched a shrill campaign against India that was aimed at influencing India’s relations with the Gulf countries.Indian intelligence agencies had earlier reported an organised effort by Pakistan to target New Delhi and Prime Minister Narendra Modi on social media by Twitter accounts opened between January and March. The report handed over to the government this week said it had spotted 7,000 more accounts that were opened in April, all of them being operated from Pakistan.The barrage of tweets, quite a few of them by handles that pass themselves off as residents or citizens of Gulf countries, have gained some traction in the local social media landscape in Islamic countries and led a number of people in the gulf countries also to fall prey to it, the report said.By way of an example, the report names one verified Twitter handle of a prominent national of a Gulf country that had been taken in by claims of persecution of Muslims in Kashmir. This account, put out a photograph of a dead man with a caption, ‘Persecution of people in Kashmir’.Also Read: In Jaish’s plan for Kashmir, simultaneous suicide attacks on May 11When security officials looked around, they found the photograph was of a Jaish terrorist killed in an encounter along with 2 Pakistani terrorists in Dhriti village of Jammu and Kashmir’s on 14 September 2018.Then there was a tweet purportedly by an Omani princess that advocated expulsion of Indian workers from the country. Sayyida Mona bint Fahd al Said, the Omani princess whose name was used by the impersonator, issued clarification that she had no connection to the tweets and the handle was a fake.Also Read: The contours of Pakistan’s new narrative on India | AnalysisIndian officials said it was clear that the social media campaign wasn’t just an invention of Pakistan’s deep state, the Inter Services Intelligence, but had its origin in Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan’s shrill pitch against India, and PM Modi at the UN General Assembly in August last year.It was the first occasion that PM Imran Khan, at an international event, had attempted to rally the world’s Muslim community to what he described as the plight of Muslims in Kashmir and beyond.It has been a recurring theme in statements from PM Khan and his foreign ministry as well but hadn’t found any reverberation outside of Islamabad. PM Khan had repeatedly made the same point during protests against amendments to the citizenship law that fast-tracked citizenship for religious minorities from Islamic countries in India’s neighbourhood.External affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava, asked about the flurry of social media posts in West Asia, this week stopped short of naming Pakistan but described much of the material on social media platforms as “propaganda by interested parties”.On some commentators calling out out what they said were Islamophobic social media posts by a handful of Indians working in the Middle East, Srivastava underscored that “stray tweets cannot be used to characterise our bilateral relations with these countries, and the real picture of these relations is very different”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/eye-on-gulf-countries-pak-ups-twitter-campaign-to-target-india-over-islamophobia/story-UOj3fXsSmwJNRlVTqrQz3K.html

This is the first special train to arrive in Uttar Pradesh with migrant labourers, who were stranded in Maharashtra and other parts of the country after Prime Minister Narendra announced the lockdown on March 24.Health workers registered the details of the migrant workers as they deboarded the train at the Charbagh station and segregated them according to the districts they belong before taking their temperature. Special buses of state transport department will ferry the passengers to their respective districts. The migrant workers were screened by health experts before they boarded the buses. Anyone with symptoms of infection will be taken to quarantine centres or hospitals.Authorities had kept ambulance on standby outside the Lucknow railway station to take passengers with Covid-19 symptoms to these quarantine centres and hospitals.Those who were allowed to make a forward journey were also handed food packets.The railways had said it will run Shramik Special trains to move migrant workers, pilgrims, tourists, students and other persons stranded at different places due to the nationwide lockdown that came into force from March 25.Ten such Shramik Special trains were run on Saturday to ferry stranded migrants to Jharkhand, UP, Bihar from Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Gujarat and the five southern states—Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Karnataka, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh.The trains scheduled from the respective railway zones were to ferry nearly 20,000 passengers, senior officials said.The Centre on Friday decided to allow these special trains to enable stranded migrants to return home amid demands by states and a recognition of the logistical challenges involved in transporting millions of people back to their homes. Five such trains operated on Friday.On Saturday, around 7,500 migrants who were stranded in Rajasthan and Uttarakhand arrived in Lucknow. A senior official said the two states transported the migrants to the borders of UP from where around 285 buses were deployed to take the migrants to their respective home districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/first-special-train-ferrying-up-migrants-reaches-lucknow-from-maharashtra-s-nashik/story-kIk7LPNh27ycQP3TMJkHYO.html

03-05-2020||India||‘Significant’ increase in cybercrime against women during lockdown: Experts||There has been a significant increase in cybercrime against women, especially sextortion, during the Covid-19-induced lockdown with “caged criminals” targeting them online, say experts.The nationwide lockdown imposed from March 25 to April 14, and then extended to May 3, aims at preventing the spread of the novel coronavirus that has claimed 1,147 lives and infected 35,043 people in the country.According to National Commission for Women (NCW) data, 54 cybercrime complaints were received online in April in comparison to 37 complaints – received online and by post -- in March, and 21 complaints in February. The panel is taking complaints online due to the lockdown.Cyber experts, however, said the numbers are just the “tip of the iceberg”.“We received a total of 412 genuine complaints of cyber abuse from March 25 till April 25. Out of these, as many as 396 complaints were serious ones from women, (and these) ranged from abuse, indecent exposure, unsolicited obscene pictures, threats, malicious emails claiming their account was hacked, ransom demands, blackmail and more,” said the founder of the Akancha Foundation, Akancha Srivastava.The organisation works for education and empowerment of people by imparting knowledge on cyber safety. Srivastava said on an average she has been getting 20-25 such complaints daily, while before the lockdown the number was less than 10 per day. This is a “significant” increase, she said.“This is just the frustration and anger that is coming to the fore as there is no other release right now. This is a form of frustration as they (cyber criminals) are caged right now,” she said. “Men are morphing images and threatening women. There is a whole racket going on where women are getting these emails that your phone and laptop has been hacked, and if you don’t deposit money my account I will send your morphed images, and share it with all your contacts,” Srivastava added.Vineet Kumar, founder and president of Cyber Peace Foundation, said specially the cases of “sextortion” have increased during the lockdown.Sextortion is extorting money or sexual favours from someone by threatening to reveal evidence of their sexual activity through means like morphed images.“People are getting into relationships online as they are under lockdown and sextortion cases are being reported to us,” he said.Kumar said in these times people are connecting through technology but forgetting the security component.“Immediately after lockdown, we saw a rise in cases of misinformation, fake news and women getting duped online when they click on malware links which gets all their information on phone, turns on the camera and microphone, and captures their intimate moments. These are then used for blackmailing,” he added.Many women do not want to make official complaints in these cases, he said.“Cyber Peace has been receiving complaints through its channels and it has been seen that people are reluctant in filing complaints. They want us to handle things unofficially,” Kumar said. “Whatever official figure that is being quoted is just the tip of the iceberg as a majority of women do not report cybercrime because they worry about the social stigma associated with it,” he said.Vandana Verma, founder of InfoSec Girls, said when the whole country is locked down, people are working from home and spending a lot of time on the internet. So, even cyber criminals are becoming innovative and craftier in their techniques, she said .“Like sending specific phishing emails or themed emails for the current COVID-19 situation to people and getting their confidential details like address, phone numbers. These emails appear to have come from legitimate sources like the government in the form of advisories when they are not at all related to the government in any form,” Verma said.“Creation of fake profiles, cyber bullying, online stalking are bigger challenges at this time. Insensitive comments on posts are also intimidating,” she said.Verma advised that such cybercrimes can be prevented through education on technology.“How to securely use the digital media, creating strong a password and spreading awareness on phishing emails, fake videos and securely sharing content on the internet can help a lot in safeguarding women,” she said. NCW chairperson Rekha Sharma said often it is seen there is lack of awareness among women on where to reach out when something happens.“There is cyber police in every district who they can contact. They can reach out to us also if they need help,” she said.She advised women to remain careful in the cyber space. “We are talking to women on how to protect themselves in cyber space. We advice women to not share their personal pictures or details on social media as it’s not safe. Women should realise that at times people known to them can also take advantage,” said Verma. CSC e-Governance Services India, which holds the license for providing internet services, recorded an increase in data consumption to 4.7 terabyte (TB) as on March 30 from 2.7 TB on March 10.“Based on the growth trend, data consumption on the CSC SPV network is estimated to have increased by close to 100 per cent till date,” CSC SPV CEO Dinesh Tyagi told PTI on April 5. He said that a major spike in data consumption has been recorded since the time lockdown started.There are more than 60 crore internet users in India and out of this about 29 crore are in rural areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/significant-increase-in-cybercrime-against-women-during-lockdown-experts/story-QNPwq5Jr1iAkAXzacLnc5K.html

According to the sources, a hunt was underway to trace the missing personnel, while the operation to neutralise the militants was also on, PTI reported.The encounter began in the afternoon after Army and police launched a joint operation in the forests of Rajwar following a tip-off about the presence of militants in the area. The militants emerged and hid inside a house.Teams of the Special Operation Group of police surrounded the house and lights had been erected around the area where the encounter was underway, a senior security official said, asking not to be named. Since the gunfight was underway, this person added, more details about the operation were not immediately available from the unit that was engaged in the encounter.Defense spokesman Rajesh Kalia didn’t respond to phone calls made by HT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gun-battle-in-handwara-at-terror-hideout/story-OorhZsP2wNDaFoYve2p9gO.html
03-05-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||May 1: 69; April 30: 76; April 29: 69; April 28: 74; April 27: 58; April 26: 51; April 25: 46; April 24: 57; April 23: 38; April 22: 39.These numbers are the death tolls of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in India on the 10 days between April 22 and May 1. On May 2, the number was 98. The total death toll in India was 1,319 on Saturday.In some ways, this is the only number to track. In the absence of a lockdown, the number of infections would have definitely soared, as would have the death toll.Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageI have written previously about how data from both Mumbai and Delhi shows that the number of non-Covid-19 deaths has reduced during the lockdown. I have also written about just how difficult it will be to hide a death from that most omnipresent thing in India — a mobile phone camera. This would suggest that the number of deaths is a good metric of just how India is handling the pandemic.There’s another reason to keep tracking this number. Most diseases are so well understood that we can work backwards from the number of deaths to find the number of those affected or infected. We don’t know enough about Covid-19 now, and the widely varying fatality rates around the world are of no help — not when, as both The New York Times and Financial Times have pointed out, based on their own analysis, the actual number of deaths from Covid-19 was much higher than those attributed to the disease. India wasn’t covered by either.But this ignorance won’t last. We already know more about the disease than we did a month back, and every day seems to bring new answers. It also brings new questions, as it should with a disease of as recent vintage as this. In a column in The New York Times written in mid-April, Charlie Warzel asked some of these questions. More have been added to that list since (and some have been answered).Eventually, we will know enough about the disease to arrive at a range, a narrow one, for the death rate. And then work backwards from that.My guess is that the death rates are nowhere close to what’s being reported. The current global death rate is 7.02% of all infected people. That’s far too high. The real number is likely to be anything between 1% and 3% (again, this is a guess, not science). But this would mean that the actual number of infected people is much higher — which is plausible. That’s actually another reason to track deaths, not number of cases.The death tallies for the week before April 22 in India were as follows: April 21: 54; April 20: 32; April 19: 39; April 18: 32; April 17: 40; April 16: 24; April 15: 33.Over the past forthright, then, the number of deaths has seen a steady increase but the numbers are not alarming — not yet. They are closer to Germany’s trajectory than they are to, say, that of the US.The worrying thing is that most countries have seen the number of deaths per day follow what’s called a hockey-stick curve — gradual curve upwards, and then a steep rise. Which is why it makes sense to watch the number of daily deaths in India, especially over the next two weeks. In more cheerful news, it turns out that Gilead’s Remdesivir, a failed hepatitis and Ebola drug, may well be a cure for Covid-19. A study in the US found that it accelerated recovery rates, although it didn’t have a huge impact on death rates (it had some). Still, that promise was enough for the US Food and Drug Administration to allow the use of the drug on Covid-19 patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-u4tgscaAERikoAfYVLl1nN.html

He elaborated how an instinct had made him stop his mother from travelling to her home in Kochi just before the lockdown was imposed in March. The Congress leader is spending some quality family time during the lockdown with his mother and sister in Kerala.“I have been very busy with my duties as a Member of Parliament throughout the fight against coronavirus. A number of my constituents reached out for help even before the lockdown was imposed. We received a number of appeals from people from Kerala who were stranded in other cities or countries, including fishermen and students. We have supplied test kits and protective medical gear to several frontline workers from my MP’s fund,” Tharoor said.“We had migrant workers too, who were itching to go back to their homes in Bihar and Bengal…I addressed them in Hindi and Bengali and asked them to stay where they were to stay safe and avoid infection,” the Congress MP from Thiruvananthapuram said.In an effort to show solidarity to those affected by Covid-19, the Fever Network is committed to uniting people against this fight with the global pandemic. Starting May 2, the Fever Network is launching ‘100 Hours 100 Stars’ – the biggest digital festival ever. Through this fest, the network is celebrating and lauding those frontline workers who risk their own lives to safeguard everyone else’s. The fest would be packed with performances, interviews and more global stars from their homes as they self-isolate during this health crisis. The campaign aims to gather funds which would then be given towards Covid-19 relief work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/100-hours-100-stars-shashi-tharoor-appeals-to-citizens-to-make-safety-their-top-priority/story-qaxPBJEBEB44szfIEhAo0H.html
03-05-2020||India||Govt plans major agricultural reforms post-coronavirus||Outlining an ambitious post-pandemic agenda for agricultural reform, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday asked his top ministers and bureaucrats to start working on a new set of reforms to cut down on archaic regulations, raise farm-gate prices, unify domestic markets as well as integrate the farm economy into global value chains.These have been demands by key farmer groups as well as a range of economists and agricultural experts over the years. The PM suggested these reforms at a high level review meeting on the agricultural sector, which was also attended by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, home minster Amit Shah, agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar and senior officials. The meeting was in a series of reviews the PM is undertaking on key sectors, in the backdrop of the national lockdown which has adversely affected the economy.The PM sought further reforms in agricultural marketing, which is a reference to the mandi system that controls buying and selling of farm produce, among other issues. He said he was not averse to bringing “appropriate” new laws or changing old ones to firmly integrate farm markets across the country so that cultivators and traders can transact without restrictions. “Essentially, he wanted one nation, one market,” said a top official familiar with the deliberations of the meeting.The PM also held a “general discussion” on genetically modified crops, a tricky subject given the widespread opposition to transgenics in the country. “It was a discussion that evaluated the various advantages and disadvantages of transgenics. The PM wanted updates on options to raise productivity, while lowering farming costs,” said the official quoted above. The PM stressed last-mile dissemination of technologies developed by agricultural research bodies.The Covid pandemic has pressured farm incomes, upending the farm-to-fork supply chain, despite full exemptions to the farm sector. A nationwide curfew caught farmers by surprise on March 24. During its the initial days, labour shortage and empty wholesale markets led farmers to dump new harvest, especially perishables. Although agriculture accounts for 16.5% of India’s gross domestic product (GDP), nearly half the population in the country depends on a farm-based income, underscoring the sector’s importance for livelihoods. The big focus on Saturday was on new ideas to intervene in the agriculture marketing system so as to make them freer, a second official said. Despite several model laws at the federal level — which serve as guidance for states — trade in agricultural commodities remains fettered by state-specific legislations, which prevent farmers from freely accessing food markets. The discussions are a nod to a renewed farm agenda, which may, in all likelihood, see fresh legislations being moved in Parliament. “The honourable prime minister wants integrated markets. One state should be agreeable with another state as far as agricultural policies go,” the second official said. The Indian agricultural market is fragmented. Each state has distinct regulations. Restrictions on where farmers can sell and to whom, as mandated by the Agricultural Produce Market Committee Acts, in various states, continue to thwart farm trade.The second official said a new legal framework governing investment and technology in agrarian economy could be necessary and the “PM acknowledged that”.“The focus was on making strategic interventions in the existing marketing ecosystem and bringing appropriate reforms in the context of rapid agricultural development,” an official statement said.K. Mani, an economist with the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, said the first step for these ideas to be successful was to have an interstate council such as the one for the Goods and Services Tax. Under a decades-old system, each state has scores of tight market zones to serve as exclusive buyer-seller platforms for an area. This system of ‘mandis’ or markets is both a physical and at times fiscal barrier, preventing seamless transactions of goods.The second official cited above said the prime minister wanted a massive scaling up of a federal e-commerce platform for farmers and traders, known as the Electronic National Agricultural Markets or the e-NAM app. The PM’s push for the app came in the backdrop of agriculture minister Tomar saying, separately, that more than 166000 registered farmers across the country are now selling their produce by transacting from home and praticising social distancing, with nearly half of the country’s 1500 major farm-end commodity markets now going online. This is the first time wholesale food markets in large states, such as Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka, have joined the digital supply chain. Farmers on the e-NAM app can strike deals for their harvests remotely by first uploading pictures of their samples and then getting these samples scientifically checked for quality by remote assayers, without having to move entire truck loads to physical markets. The e-NAM platform now has a total of 785 markets online. Saturday’s review was preceded by recommendations earlier this year from a committee of secretaries tasked with reviewing the agriculture sector. It identified persistent trade barriers within the mandi system that continue to hurt producers. The government could consider a “single mandi tax for the country” and “removal of levies” charged to traders and farmers when farm goods are sold from one state to another, known as interstate mandi tax, a third official said.“Making farm marketing reforms work is similar to opening FDI in manufacturing. That’s how big it is. It’s after all about prices for producers,” said S Mahendra Dev, director and vice-chancellor of the Mumbai-based Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research. Dev formerly headed the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices, the federal body that fixes minimum support prices. Ushered in during the 1960s, most Agricultural Produce Market Committee Acts – each state has its own law — require farmers to only sell to licensed middlemen in notified markets, usually in the same area as the farmer, rather than directly to buyers elsewhere. These rules were meant to protect farmers from being forced into distress selling. But over time, they have spawned layers of intermediaries, spanning the farm-to-fork supply chain. This results in a large “price spread” or the fragmentation of profit shares due to the presence of many middlemen. Saturday’s meet also discussed possible model land tenancy laws. Outdated land tenancy laws in many states mean that tenant farmers don’t get access to farm loans because they don’t own land. Tenancy reforms can lead to more contract and organised farming without affecting “adverse possession” or ownership of land.“One reason why agriculture has suffered is that we have not liberated the sector like we have done for industry. Without compromising food security, you have to open up. The government cannot assume it knows everything. I think that’s what the government has realised now,” said Manoj Kumar Panda, the RBI chair professor at the Institute of Economic Growth, University of Delhi. Bureaucrats suggested creation of commodity-specific administrative bodies and promotion of agriculture clusters as well as contract farming to boost exports.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-plans-major-agri-reforms-post-corona/story-EISmhgFEzDaI4386TorfwM.html
03-05-2020||India||Shramik Special trains to ferry 20,000 stranded across country||Twenty Shramik Special trains were scheduled to run Saturday to ferry stranded migrants to Jharkhand, UP, Bihar from Rajashtan, Maharashtra, Gujarat and the five southern states—Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Karnataka, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh.The trains scheduled from the respective railway zones were to ferry nearly 20,000 passengers, senior officials said.“Trains are being planned at the request of the states. Twenty trains are scheduled to run today following all the standard protocols,” Railway Protection Force DG Arun Kumar said.However, of the 20 scheduled special trains, the Indian Railways said 10 special trains ran on Saturday. “As per information received, various zonal railways have run around 10 Shramik Special trains today (Saturday) on the demand of various state governments,” railway ministry said. Amid demands by states and a recognition of the logistical challenges involved in transporting millions of people back to their home states, the Centre on Friday decided to allow special trains—called Shramik Specials—to enable stranded migrants to return home. Five such trains operated on Friday.According to officials, the railways is unlikely to run trains originating from containment zones like Delhi, Mumbai and Ahmedabad. “There are no trains planned for Mumbai but trains are being run from other destinations like Bhiwandi and Vasai near Mumbai. Trains will only run to these places when the demand from the state government comes,” the official added.Railways also announced that it will charge to operate special trains for stranded migrant workers amid the lockdown. The fare includes the price of regular sleeper class tickets, plus a superfast charge of ₹30 and an additional charge of ₹20, adding that state governments can coordinate and pay on the passengers’ behalf.Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren Saturday tweeted saying the government should roll back the fare on special trains, adding that it was an “injustice to our labourers who are returning home.”The ministry of railways had also clarified that the special trains were planned only for those identified and registered by state governments. “No one, under any circumstance, should come to railway stations looking for trains. We will not issue any tickets to any individual or entertain any request from any group or individual. We will allow only those passengers to board whom state government officials bring to the railway stations,” the ministry said.The railway ministry has said that trains would operate from point-to-point on the request of the concerned state governments. Senior officials would be appointed as nodal officers. It clarified, “The passengers have to be screened by the sending states and only those found asymptomatic will be allowed to travel.” It would also be the responsibility of the governments to bring such individuals to the designated stations in sanitised buses, following social distancing norms. All passengers will have to mandatorily wear masks; while meals and drinking water will be provided, according to the ministry, by the government sending them back home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shramik-special-trains-to-ferry-20-000-stranded-across-country/story-QrhP8sNf8mAbuUR2CFcxmK.html
03-05-2020||India||Filing of cases in SC will undergo radical change: Justice DY Chandrachud||Filing of cases in the Supreme Court will undergo a radical change with the introduction and operationalisation of e-filing, chairperson of the e-committee of Supreme Court, Justice DY Chandrachud said in a telephonic interview. The work towards this is at an advanced stage and the system is expected to be rolled out soon, he added.“We have been working on the e-filing module for the past few months. I utilized the lockdown period to have our entire team of the registrar and almost eleven data programmers work continuously on it. The module is now being tested for its stability. We are at an advanced stage and will be commencing e-filing of all cases in the Supreme Court in the near future”, justice Chandrachud said.He added that the concerns of all stakeholders, especially lawyers, will be taken into account and their suggestions incorporated before the system is finally rolled out.“We are conversant of the need to ensure that we have the confidence of all segments of the Bar. We will not start any process until we have created that understanding at the bar and ensure that they understand what we are doing.”In order to ensure that the Bar is taken on board, the court might host a webinar for lawyers in coming days to unveil the module, understand their concerns and consider their suggestions. “Once that is done, the system will be put through an audit before it is finally rolled out”, Chandrachud added.So what are the immediate advantages of e-filing?“With the introduction of e-filing, people will be able to file cases in the Supreme Court 24x7 and it won’t be restricted to working hours of the court. Curing of defects in the petitions will also be through electronic mode. It will make life much easier for litigants, lawyers, law clerks and of course for our registry staff also”, he said.The top court has also begun the process of digitization of pending cases. This did pose some challenges, Chandrachud said.“One of the technological issues faced was to ensure that the digitized files of pending cases are brought on the same platform as the fresh cases which will be filed using that platform. We have been able to streamline that. Development of e-payment gateway for payment of court fees also posed some challenges.”The Supreme Court , in 2017, launched the initiative of digitization and online filing but the project went into cold storage after the retirement of then Chief Justice of India, JS Khehar. “Perhaps it all happened very suddenly and was done without the system being stabilized. We cannot say overnight that we are going to have e-filing, or that everything is going to be digitized. We cannot dump that on litigants and lawyers. That is also why I have not kept a cut-off date (for launch) so as to obviate the problems which arose in the past. We will ensure that until lawyers get familiar with the system and their clerks are in a position to take over the system we will do the handholding at the Supreme Court. We are making it as user-friendly as possible,” added ChandrachudSome high courts have also taken up initiatives for digitizing their records of disposed of and pending cases.“Now that has to be coupled with e-filing so that both fresh cases, and disposed of and pending cases are brought on the same platform. But there should be a standard operating procedure (SOP) for the benefit of all high courts and the district judiciary”.The e-committee at the Supreme Court will soon constitute a panel of experts from the private sector and government agencies who will help draw up a standard operating procedure for digitization across the nation.“Once that is done, each high court can utilise that protocol and do that process of digitsation. Once e-filing starts in Supreme Court, it will catch up in a big way in high courts,” said ChandrachudThe Supreme Court’s first major tryst with technology happened on March 24 when the Covid-19 pandemic led to a national lockdown. Hearings since then have been happening through video conferencing but many issues have arisen regarding the same.“We were confronted with a situation almost overnight when lockdown was announced and we could not have court hearings. So instead of barring access to justice completely, we thought that the next best option was to have hearings through video conferencing”, Chandrachud said.One concern flagged by lawyers and media is regarding violation of open court hearing when it comes to video conferencing.Justice Chandrachud agreed that open court hearing is one of the fundamental precepts of our system but said that crowd is regulated even in physical proceeding in open courts.“Open court proceedings are open from two perspectives – first, free access for reporting to media, and second, that access to court rooms should be available to the members of the public who have an interest in the proceedings. We cannot have, say 5,000 people coming into a court room because we have space constraints.”He said that the objective must be to ensure that the court does not detract from the fundamental principles of an open court.“That is not to say that anybody who wants a link to the hearing will be entitled to get it. Technology also has constraints. As long there is no bar on media on one hand and members of public who would want to hear the matter of public interest, I think the principle of open court room is going to be facilitated.”Justice Chandrachud was part of the Supreme Court bench which passed an order on April 6 legalising use of video conferencing to hear cases during Covid-19 lockdown.“We gave legal sanctity to video conferencing by an overarching judicial order which sort of covered all high courts in the country. But we left it to the discretion of every high court on various nuances because we did not want to handhold the high courts and foreclose their discretion in adopting technology which they felt was best suited to their purpose.”The e-committee of the Supreme Court has now finalised model rules on video conferencing.“These rules are being circulated to all high court chief justices for adoption so as to ensure uniformity in video conferencing but subject to such situational modifications as may be necessary from state to state,” said ChandrachudHowever, he added that video conferencing is not a replacement for physical hearings.“A court is a physical space. Video conferencing and technology in my opinion are an amazing supplement to the functioning of courts. It can be used to examine a witness who is abroad, medical experts who might have to travel to give evidence and for disposal of petty cases which do not require application of judicial mind. Delhi has set up a system for online payment of traffic challans which wipes out a lot of cases from the system.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/filing-of-cases-in-sc-will-undergo-radical-change-justice-dy-chandrachud/story-sFNEpebBzq5Z8rxAJawSpI.html
03-05-2020||India||Cong, BJP in tussle over Covid-19 strategy||India’s plan to fight Covid-19 triggered a political blame game on Saturday with the Congress asking Prime Minister Narendra Modi to address the nation on a lockdown exit plan and the Centre calling the Opposition rudderless. The Congress said the Union home ministry’s order on the extension of the curbs on Friday left many queries unanswered.“The order for the lockdown 3.0 did not come with an address from the PM [Prime Minister], and neither did the [Union] home minister [Amit Shah] come forward to make an announcement. Not even a single officer of the government chose to make an appearance,” said Congress’s chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala. He said the government should spell out the purpose, objective and strategy behind the lockdown, whether there will be more lockdowns and the strategy to deal with economic distress. “What is the exit strategy, what is the PM’s policy and what is the roadmap? Are there grants for the sowing of the next kharif crops, and what are the arrangements for ensuring livelihood and ration for over 400 million urban and rural poor. Is there a relief package for the 42.5 million MSMEs [Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises]? These are questions that need answers.”He said the Congress has proposed a financial exit plan and recommended the government to transfer Rs 7,500 into Jan Dhan, PM Kisan Yojana accounts and those of Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee labourers, senior citizen, widow, and physically handicapped pensioners. “In addition, 10 kg of food grains, one kg pulses and half kg of sugar be given per person per family for sustenance. The government must also ensure free travel in sanitised trains for the stranded migrant workers,” he said.Union minister Prakash Javadekar dismissed criticism over the Centre’s efforts to check the pandemic, saying the government is more interested in saving lives and livelihoods than indulging in verbal duels.“As far as Opposition is concerned, I think they are rudderless. They have no agenda or issues,” he told news agency ANI. “They have not said a single good thing, nor given any good suggestions. Now they are blaming the government on points on which they earlier agreed. There is a complete bankruptcy of political opponents.”Javadekar was responding to Congress leaders allegations of corruption in acquiring coronavirus testing kits, discrimination in sending kits to states, and managing the issue of migrant workers.

03-05-2020||India||BCG vaccine may help Covid-19 health workers: Study||The Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine to prevent tuberculosis must be administered to health care workers and the elderly as prophylaxis (preventive action) for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), according to a paper published in the Indian Journal of Orthopaedics.“BCG vaccine is known to confer a broad-spectrum immunity not just against tuberculosis but other diseases. Indians are already administered BCG as part of our immunisation programme, but other countries, where it has been stopped, might use BCG vaccine prophylaxis along with chloroquine that is now being used. It is already tested in humans and widely available,” said Dr Ajay Gupta, the author of the article and orthopaedic surgeon from Maulana Azad Medical College.Immunity conferred through BCG vaccine may be effective in preventing a cytokine storm, the article suggests. A cytokine storm is when the immune system goes into an overdrive and starts attacking the body’s own cells and tissues other than fighting off an infection.“Viral-specific CD8 T cells (of key importance to the immune system) were seen to have special affinity towards BCG-induced granulomas (a collection of immune cells) resulting in substantial accumulation of viral-specific CD8 T cells there. Such an affinity can be made to be used in patients with COVID-19 to divert and subvert its overactive immune response towards BCG granulomas,” the study reads.“This basically means that BCG-induced immune response might reduce the chances of cytokine storms, which is what leads to deaths in such viral infections,” said Dr Gupta. “However, the immune response is generated six to ten weeks after the vaccine is given. In the meantime, for immediate protection already available, oral salmonella vaccine may be used to boost Th1 immunity,” he added.Th1 immunity refers to immunity against intracellular parasites. “There is no concrete evidence to suggest that BCG-vaccine will protect against the viral infection, but it is a hypothesis that needs to be studied by comparing robust data from places where the vaccine is administered and where it is not. However, BCG-vaccine is a known immune-modulator,” said Dr Shobha Broor, former head of department of microbiology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences.Australia, for instance, has embarked on a large clinical study of the BCG vaccine among health workers. Apart from looking at immune-modulation through available vaccines, the article also suggests that natural exposure to mycobacterium (tuberculosis), Salmonella (Typhoid), and influenza can boost the immune system resulting in less severe infections and deaths due to Covid-19.“COVID-19 has been seen to affect more of those countries who have robust and free influenza vaccination program leading to reduced natural flu infection among their population,” the article reads.“Countries where flu vaccines are readily available have witnessed a bad course of the infection. This might be because in the absence of natural flu infection, the mucous membrane is unable to develop the innate immunity that is effective against all kinds of pathogens,” said Dr Gupta.To study the impact of the natural infections on the course of Covid-19, Dr Gupta’s team will do immune profiling of 20 Covid-19 patients who have severe disease, 20 who have mild symptoms, and 20 people who haven’t had the infection. The team has received an ethical clearance for the study.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bcg-vaccine-may-help-health-workers-study/story-ADx5vFIBjmq3DHZMylGaDO.html

The fly-past is planned between 10am and 10.30am. The aircraft will be flying at a height of 500 to 1,000 metre and will be visible to the residents of Delhi from their rooftops, the spokesperson said.Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageThe fly-past by the fighter jets will be followed by the C-130J special operations aircraft flying over Delhi-NCR in formation.The IAF spokesperson said helicopters will shower petals over the National Police Memorial and Delhi hospitals involved in providing relief to Covid-19 patients.These include Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital, GTB Hospital, Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, Safdarjung Hospital, Sri Ganga Ram Hospital, Baba Saheb Ambedkar Hospital, Apollo Indraprastha Hospital and the Army Hospital (Research and Referral).Wreaths will be laid at the police memorial on behalf of the three service chiefs.Fighter jets and transport planes will carry out fly-pasts across the length and breadth of the country, from Srinagar to Thiruvananthapuram and Dibrugarh to Kutch, as reported by Hindustan Times on Sunday.The Indian Navy will illuminate its warships at anchorage from 7.30pm to midnight at Mumbai, Porbandar, Karwar, Vizag, Chennai, Kochi and Port Blair, a navy spokesperson said. He added that naval helicopters will shower petals over Covid-19 hospitals in Mumbai and Goa. Also, 46 Indian Coast Guard ships will be lit up at 25 locations along the country’s eastern and western seaboards, the defence ministry said. Ten coast guard helicopters will shower flower petals over Covid-19 hospitals in Daman, Mumbai, Goa, Chennai and Port Blair.The tributes being offered to Covid-19 warriors will see army bands perform outside several hospitals and locations across the country, including the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, the Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, the Army’s RR Hospital and the Base Hospital in Delhi Cantt, an army spokesperson said. Dal Lake in Srinagar is among the locations where army bands will perform to honour Covid-19 warriors.“The armed forces have always stood as a wall against all threats to the country and every time our citizens have come out in large numbers and showered their blessings and appreciation towards us. This time, it is our turn to applaud the sacrifice of our corona warriors,” the army spokesperson said.The military’s plan to honour front-line workers was finalised at a meeting chaired by defence minister Rajnath Singh on Friday. The meeting was attended by the national security adviser, the CDS and the three service chiefs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/forces-to-honour-front-line-workers-today/story-ANZHGSlT1rlVqb28EboUEO.html
03-05-2020||India||India permits 88 medical staffers to visit UAE for care||The Indian government on Saturday permitted 88 doctors and healthcare professionals to travel to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to support efforts to fight the Covid-19 pandemic even as the West Asian state sent a plane with seven tonnes of medical supplies to New Delhi.The foreign ministers of several West Asian countries had raised the issue of the return of Indian doctors employed in their healthcare facilities during recent telephone conversations with external affairs minister S Jaishankar. They had also sought medicines such as hydroxychloroquine from India.A statement from the UAE embassy said Indian authorities had allowed the first batch of 88 specialists, doctors and nurses to travel to the UAE within a short period to support efforts to fight Covid-19. It did not say when the batch would leave for the UAE.People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that the batch included healthcare professionals employed in the UAE who were at home on leave when Covid-19-related travel restrictions were put in place, and those were recently recruited by the emirates to bolster efforts to counter the pandemic.The batch is expected to fly out of India after the completion of certain formalities as the matter had been cleared by the external affairs ministry, the people said.In a separate development, the UAE sent a special flight carrying seven tonnes of medical supplies to India to bolster efforts to curb the spread of Covid-19. “The aid will assist approximately 7,000 medical professionals as they work to combat the virus,” said a statement from the UAE embassy.UAE ambassador Ahmed Al Banna said: “The UAE is committed to extending critical support to nations seeking to bolster their fight against the Covid-19 pandemic. The UAE assistance to India comes in recognition of the profound and brotherly ties our two countries have shared throughout the years.The UAE has provided more than 348 tonnes of aid to nearly 35 countries, supporting nearly 348,000 professionals. The Indian consulate in Dubai thanked the UAE for the aid in a tweet and said: “We are also happy that we have been able to send medicines to UAE to fight Covid-19 and more medical personnel should come to UAE soon.”India has earlier deployed a medical rapid response team to Kuwait for two weeks to provide technical expertise and train that country’s medical personnel.The UAE is home to more than 3 million Indian expatriates, and tens of thousands of them work in the healthcare sector. The people cited above said nearly 30,000 Indians had so far registered with the missions in the UAE to return home once travel restrictions are eased.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-permits-88-medical-staffers-to-visit-uae-for-care/story-kx7b3KL7PGr1R39JBQAIhN.html
03-05-2020||India||Covid-19: Liquor, paan shop owners gear up for contactless sales||A day after the Centre on Friday allowed the sale of liquor in standalone liquor stores as well as the sale of paan/gutkha and other tobacco products across the country from May 4 except in Covid-19 containment zones, stores are gearing up to resume business with social distancing norms and other guidelines in place.The government has categorised all 733 districts across the country in three zones: red (hotspots); orange (having a limited number of Covid-19 cases); and green (no cases).There are, however, strict social distancing norms in place. People going to such stores will have to maintain at least six feet distance between themselves and store owners will have to ensure that no more than five people are present at a shop at any given time. Spitting in public places remains punishable.Liquor and paan shops inside malls or marketplaces are not allowed to operate yet. Neither are such stores in containment zones. Containment zones are those areas in red and orange zones that have been sealed due to a high number of Covid-19 infections. Only essential activities are permitted in these areas.The government order on lockdown on Friday stated that any person violating the lockdown measures or directives could be prosecuted under the Disaster Management Act and the Indian Penal Code.The government had prohibited the sale of liquor and paan/gutkha since March 24, when the first phase of lockdown was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Since then, several states ,including Kerala, West Bengal and Punjab, repeatedly urged the central government to lift the ban on sale of liquor citing depletion of state revenues. Liquor is one of the major contributors to states’ coffers. The International Spirits and Wines Association of India (ISWAI), which has Diageo India, Pernod Ricard, Beam Suntory, Bacardi and others as members, had asked the union consumer affairs ministry to allow shops to sell alcoholic beverages for some hours during the day.Another body, the Confederation of Indian Alcoholic Beverages Companies (CIABC), had also asked the government to allow the sale of liquor, citing huge losses.ISWAI chairman, Amrit Kiran Singh, said, “We have committed to the government that social distancing will be maintained at the liquor vends. As soon as the latest guidelines come into force, we will begin a programme called ‘Safe Shield’, under which signs will be put outside all shops about social distancing. Sanitisers will be placed outside shops. There will be contactless sales through trays kept at the counter.”Singh added that the aim of the second phase of ‘Safe Shield’ is to use services of online delivery platforms, such as Swiggy and Zomato, for delivery of bottles for which, he said, ISWAI is trying to convince the state governments. “This will release the load from the retail stores.” “The load on retail stores being released through online delivery will happen as soon as state governments allow it. It should happen immediately,” Singh said.As much as 75% percent of India’s liquor market is in retail while 25% is in bar sales, which stands prohibited. Last year, liquor sales brought in Rs 2.84 lakh crore revenue to state governments, according to Singh.“Covid-19 is going to stay for some time so we have to institutionalise ‘Safe Shield’ and home delivery measures into liquor retail sales. If we do this properly, 75% of revenue to states can come back,” he added.A senior home ministry official, who didn’t want to be named, explained on Friday that “the decision to reopen standalone liquor stores across all three zones has been taken as part of resuming economic activity, which is directly linked to the revenues of the states. The state governments are free to decide where they want to open the liquor stores/paan shops.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/liquor-paan-shop-owners-gear-up-for-contactless-sales/story-QzLqwEDQh7ND1L9M1agzaN.html
03-05-2020||India||Experts raise concerns over Aarogya Setu||The government’s decision to make it mandatory for people to install its Aarogya Setu mobile application has inadequate legal basis and exposes users to possible surveillance, according to experts who are now appealing for the directive to be rolled back or stronger safeguards to be introduced, even as the tool triggered a political spat between the government and the opposition Congress on Saturday. The main function of Aarogya Setu is to keep a track of people who come close to each other while having the applications on their phones. Their contact history can be pulled up if any one of these persons tests positive for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), which will make tracing of all contacts who would have been exposed to an infectious person faster.The home ministry’s decision on Friday to make it must for people going to work from Monday onwards to install the application was criticised by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, who said the tool was “intrusive” before Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad responded by calling the claim “a lie”. “The Aarogya Setu app is a sophisticated surveillance system, outsourced to a private operator, with no institutional oversight - raising serious data security and privacy concerns. Technology can help keep us safe; but fear must not be leveraged to track citizens without their consent,” Gandhi said in a tweet on Saturday. To this, Prasad responded with two tweets: “Daily a new lie. Aarogya Setu is a powerful companion which protects people. It has a robust data security architecture. Those who indulged in surveillance all their lives, won’t know how tech can be leveraged for good!”“Aarogya Setu is now being appreciated globally. The App is NOT outsourced to any private operator. Mr. Gandhi really high time that you stop outsourcing your tweets to your cronies who do not understand India,” he said.Cyber law expert Pavan Duggal said the need for a digital contact tracing method was understandable. “However, there is no law passed by the parliament authorizing the creation and making mandatory of this app which is in contravention of the Information Technology Act, 2000 and Act and rules and regulations. So, while it could be used as an emergency measure (in this case for tracing Covid patients), it could open up a Pandora’s box of legal challenges for the government,” said cyber law expert Pavan Duggal. According to Duggal, when the application was launched, the developers uploaded the terms and conditions as well as privacy policy, but the terms and conditions that stated that ‘government won’t be responsible for any unauthorized leakage of data’ have been removed, at least from Apple store. “The privacy policy also doesn’t give any clarity on how secure your data is. There is no mention of any cyber security parameters and it doesn’t explain how it complies with the IT Act 2000 and IT Rules 2011. The app still doesn’t tell us who all might be able to access my data in terms of governmental agencies. So, the chances of this data being used for monitoring people cannot be ruled out,” he added.While such applications exist in other parts of the world, privacy experts point out that India’s is the only one with a source code that is not open for review. Around 45 organisations and more than 100 individuals on Saturday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, home minister Amit Shah and electronics and IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad against the mandatory use of the Aarogya Setu app for workers. “While the government initially claimed that the use of Aarogya Setu would be purely voluntary, downloading the app was soon made mandatory for all Central Armed Police Forces personnel and employees of Prasar Bharati,” the letter signed by the groups stated. The move could also violate privacy laws as well as the Puttaswamy privacy judgement, the letter says. A government representative, however, denied that there were privacy issues. Abhishek Singh of MyGov termed the concerns as non-issues and said that the app is mandatory only till the pandemic exists. “Till the epidemic law is in force, only those who are travelling to offices will have to download the app. Once the epidemic is over, a user can delete the app,” Singh said. Varun Jhaveri, an official in the government’s Ayushman Bharat programme, cited the privacy policy to say that the data collected by the application was sent and stored on servers “operated and managed by the government” in a tweet on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/experts-raise-concerns-over-aarogya-setu/story-OKhxndnbIBYYbjyT7Y1o8N.html
03-05-2020||India||Farmers go online to sell their produce in Covid-19 lockdown||On Saturday, 200 new agricultural markets or mandis were added to the e-Nam e-commerce platform for agricultural produce, almost a fourth of the 785 markets on the platform which was launched in 2016 to benefit farmers, but whose popularity has surged in recent weeks following the coronavirus disease pandemic and the lockdown enforced to combat it. At least 166000 registered farmers across the country are now selling their produce by transacting from home and praticising social distancing, with nearly half of the country’s 1500 major farm-end commodity markets now going online on e-NAM, agriculture minister Narendra Sing Tomar said.This is the first time wholesale food markets in large states, such as Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka, have joined the digital supply chain. These mandis, or markets, are the first point of sale for farmers in a delicate supply chain, and will help connect them with more than 100,000 traders, who are also wired in, through the e-NAM mobile app. Wholesale markets, which are usually crowded, could be key coronavirus hot spots as they host several layers of trading intermediaries, from farmers, small merchants, food aggregators to commission agents. Farmers on the e-NAM app can strike deals for their harvests remotely by first uploading pictures of their samples and then getting these samples scientifically checked for quality by remote assayers, without having to move entire truck loads to physical markets. As a result, farmers need not crowd these mandis, scouting for buyers because the e-NAM platform essentially serves as a buyer-seller platform.The additional 200 markets integrated into the e-NAM platform include 11 in Andhra Pradesh, 25 in Gujarat, 16 in Odisha, 94 in Rajasthan, 27 in Tamil Nadu, 25 in Uttar Pradesh and two in Karnataka. “This is the first milestone achieved in the path of integrating 415 new markets across the country. It is for the first time that Karnataka state has been added to the list of e-NAM States,” Tomar said. According to an official who spoke on condition of anonymity, the agriculture ministry, in view of the pandemic, has added two new features or options in the e-NAM platform last month so that famers can sell their produce without bringing them to physical markets. The first, “FPO option” allows farmer producer organisations, which are agri businesses to trade on the app from their collection centres. The second, called the “warehouse module”, allows farmers to sell their produce stored in registered warehouses. “What hold some these e-NAM markets back is that in many places, state governments have not appointed adequate number of food assayers. All vacancies for food scientists must be filled to make the platform functioning to its maximum potential,” said Anil Sardana, a consultant who worked with the Karnataka government to set up a similar state-specific platform. “It takes a little getting used to,” says farmer Jaspal Singh Nain of Haryana’s Babbain near Kurukshetra, adding: “One issue of late is that sample examiners (who are responsible for grading quality) are not always available.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-go-online-to-sell-their-produce-in-lockdown/story-gZ8B9PucFvEhkjKUqImFxN.html
03-05-2020||India||States issue guidelines for extended lockdown||A day after the Centre extended lockdown till May 17, most states decided to follow the home ministry’s guidelines allowing several activities in the green and orange zones to kickstart economy and official work, with a few exceptions.Maharashtra decided to continue with a hard lockdown in Mumbai, Pune, Nashik and Thane, overlooking the exemptions provided by the Centre for red zones, from where the most number of cases have been reported, and allowed liquor sales but not that of tobacco products. Neighbouring Gujarat decided industries units across the state, except in containment zones, can resume operations fully.Kerala decided not to open liquor shops or allow public transport or restaurants ; on April 19, it allowed all these services but reversed its decision after a reprimand from the Centre. Andhra will start liquor manufacturing in rural areas from Monday to boost state finances. Karnataka decided to open liquor shops across the state, except in containment zones.Assam opened its border with the neighbouring states for the first time since the lockdown came into force on March 25 to allow stranded persons to return. Uttarakhand said it could allow state residents from Covid free districts to visit the Char Dham , the four holy sites of Kedarnath, Badrinath, Gangotri and Yamunotri. West Bengal on Sunday is expected to announce its own lockdown norms for only four red zones as against 10 decided by the Central government. Officials said that there could be relaxation for jute mills, tea gardens, allowing some public transport in non-Covid districts and opening of standalone shops across the state.The Centre on Friday extended the lockdown till May 17 , but allowed almost all activities, except opening of malls, educational institutions, restaurants and hotels, running of public transport , inter-state travel and social, political and religious gatherings, in about 370 green districts. It also allowed opening of all medical facilities in green, orange and red zones, asking states to prescribe social distancing norms.The Maharashtra government issued a state specific lockdown notification similar to the Central one but had more stringent provisions for red zones including in Mumbai and Pune, where the number of coronavirus positive cases is high. While the Centre allowed standalone shops and offices to resume work with 33% staff in private firms red zones, Maharashtra did not. Even the industrial relaxations given by the Centre such as allowing industries to function in non-municipal areas in red zones has not been allowed, except for essential goods. The central guidelines allow states to pass their own, as long as they are tougher ; no dilution is allowed in the central guidelines, though. However, Maharashtra allowed all pre-monsoon related work including “protection of building, shuttering, flood protection, structural repairs, demolition of unsafe buildings’’ including in red zones with social distancing norms.In non-red zones, liquor shops will open as per Centre’s guidelines but tobacco and pan shops will continue to be closed. “Liqour shops will not be allowed to operate in the red zones but will be kept open in green and orange zones for now,” a Maharashtra government official said on condition of anonymity.Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said public transport will not be allowed in any zones and liquor outlets will remain closed till May 17 throughout the state. He also announced a series of measures to protect aged and people who have co-morbid conditions.The CM said easing of some of the norms will affect the advantage the state achieved so far. “Opening of liquor shops will result in crowding. We want to avoid it,” he said. After Punjab, where liquor shops will open in non-Covid areas from Monday, Kerala stands second in per capita liquor consumption in the country. Going with the Centre’s guidelines, Kerala allowed private cars only three persons will be allowed including the driver and no pillion rider on two-wheelers but continued the ban on public transport.Karnataka excise minister H Nagesh said standalone liquor shops will open except in containment zones from Monday. The state had been losing about Rs 1800 crore per month because of liquor outlets being shut.The state government allowed reopening of the garment sector, a big employer, and other industries with one-third staff. Karnataka CM B S Yediyurappa wrote to his Maharashtra counterpart Uddhav Thackrey requesting him to release 6 TMC of water for ensuring drinking water purposes to North Karnataka districts of Belgavi, Vijaypura, Bagalkot, Kalaburgi, Yadagiri and Raichur.Andhra Pradesh government on Saturday allowed manufacturing of Indian Made Foreign Liquor and beer in the state with immediate effect. There are in all 21 big and small breweries and distilleries in the state, said an order issued by Commissioner of Distilleries and Breweries, D Vasudeva Reddy.At a review meeting on Saturday, chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy ordered the officials to identify the containment zones. State government officials added that after Monday at least 50% of industries will resume operations. Telangana will announce its lockdown norms only after cabinet meeting on Monday. On Saturday, Assam health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma announced that the state will open its borders with other states in the northeast from Sunday to allow return of residents in their own vehicles and in buses.“For those who don’t have own means of transport, we will be sending buses to pick them up within a few days. Notifications in this regard will be issued soon,” he said, while launching a helpline No: 7428159966 for persons from the state stranded in other parts of the country. Nearly two million Assamese workers are stranded outside the state.Sarma said that the government’s move to fly back 852 patients from the state undergoing treatment outside has met with roadblock after two cancer patients in Mumbai tested positive for Covid-19. Assam has recorded 42 Covid-19 positive cases till date.The Uttarakhand government is likely to allow pilgrims from within the state to visit Kedarnath, Gangotri and Yamunotri shrines, which were opened this week, from May 4. Chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat said that from May 4, inter-district movement will be allowed in the green zones of the state allowing people to visit Char Dham shrines while maintaining social distancing. All the four shrines are in the green zones. “We will clarify with the central government guidelines first as to whether movement from orange to green zones can be allowed or not, but those who wish to go in their private cars can be allowed after May 4,” said cabinet minister, Madan Kaushik.In Himachal, the government allowed curfew relaxation from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. and decided to waive electricity bills of hotels. Chief minister Jairam Thakur also constituted three ministerial committees to suggest measures for revival of economy. All offices will open in Himachal with 30% attendance.(With state bureau inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-issue-guidelines-for-extended-lockdown/story-yWSp4w4rLD2Og2K6qzcjMJ.html
03-05-2020||India||As migrants return, states guard against Covid surge||States receiving migrant labourers from across India are gearing up for a massive challenge: a spurt in Covid-19 cases. And, some states such as Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Odisha, have already unveiled unprecedented steps.The Bihar government has made a 21-day quarantine mandatory for all workers and has cancelled the leave of all doctors and health workers. Odisha, which will test all workers for Covid-19 after a mandatory 14-day quarantine period, has instructed all community centres to remain open around the clock, and has decided to create 4,200 new isolation beds.Like most other states, Uttar Pradesh has made a 14-day quarantine mandatory, after which each family will get food grains for 15 days. The state has created special isolation wards at district hospitals. Jharkhand will be providing cooked meals to workers during the 15-day quarantine period and free rations for their families. On Friday, Indian railways ran special trains, called Shramik, to take migrant workers back to their villages. More trains took back workers from at least 10 states on Saturday. However, the return of migrant workers has created a fear of Covid-19 cases increasing.At least seven migrant workers, who returned to Uttar Pradesh, have tested positive. In just one district of Bihar, 13 migrant workers have tested positive. In Odisha, 20 workers, who returned from Bengal, have tested positive.Between April 25 and May 1, when many workers returned, Bihar reported 243 new cases, which is almost 50% of the 475 cases in the state. Officials said many of the new cases reported in the second phase of the lockdown were migrants, who somehow managed to reach Bihar, and spread infections to new areas.Many of the new cases have been reported from districts, such as Madhubani, Darbhanga, Sitamarhi and Purnea, which were previously free of Covid-19 cases. Madhubani district magistrate, Dr Nilesh Ramchandra Deor, said all the 13 positive cases are of migrants from Delhi, Mumbai and Lucknow, while the origin of the earlier five cases was traced to a woman who came by car from Delhi.“The emerging trend of new cases shows the challenging phase for the state may have just begun with more and more people returning to their native places and we have to be prepared for it,” said a senior official of the government, who was not willing to be named.The state government has cancelled leaves of doctors, health officials and contractual employees in the health department till May 31. All medical facilities have been asked to remain prepared for the admissions of a large number of cases, an official said.In Uttar Pradesh, seven daily wage workers, who returned from Maharashtra, tested positive for Covid-19. They have been put in government quarantine in Basti district. District magistrate, Ashutosh Niranjan, said that the workers had travelled in state-run buses from Maharashtra. Uttar Pradesh was one of the first states to bring back stranded workers by buses.The state government officials said about a million migrants, who are expected to return, will be kept at the district and panchayat quarantine centres. The officials also said that additional isolation beds have been created at the district level, should there be a spurt in cases. “Special attention is being paid to workers coming back from Maharashtra, which has the highest number of cases in India,” said a senior UP government official. The state first Shramik train, carrying 847 migrants, will reach Lucknow’s Charbagh railway station on Sunday morning from Nashik. Divisional railway manager (DRM), Lucknow division, NR Sanjay Tripathi, said, “We have also made arrangements at the station to strictly ensure social distancing.” Once the migrant labourers go through the thermal scanning, the district wise segregation will be done and they will be taken to buses. “We have arranged 65 buses for them,” said Mukesh Meshram, divisional commissioner, Lucknow.In Odisha, about 20 workers who returned from West Bengal, have tested positive for Covid-19 in the past few days in Ganjam and other districts. “More than half of the 149 Covid-19 cases in Odisha have travel history of hotspots in West Bengal,” said Odisha chief secretary, Asit Tripathy. On Friday, two new cases were reported from Bolangir district with a travel history to Tamil Nadu.About 325 workers from Surat in Gujarat, who hired seven buses to return, are in quarantine. Around 1,200 workers from Kerala, who reached Odisha on Saturday morning, have been sent to quarantine centres in their respective districts, the chief secretary said. Odisha has quarantined returned workers in 7000-odd temporary medical centres, with 2.6 lakh beds, in the grampanchayats. Four buses carrying more than 120 workers left for West Bengal from Dumka district on Friday. These buses were supposed to bring over 100 Jharkhand workers from 24-Pargana South, Howrah, Kolkata and Malda.“The buses were stopped at Bengal border and the officials there said that they have not received any such order to allow buses of other states. So, the buses were asked to return,” said Dumka deputy commissioner Rajeshwari B.Dhanbad deputy commissioner (DC), Amit Kumar, said the state is in talks with officials of the West Bengal government but they are not allowing buses to enter border. “So, we have decided to send out buses to other neighbouring states, excluding Bengal, to bring back our migrant workers,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-migrants-return-states-guard-against-covid-surge/story-CGA2Q0BwelMduO5oRoG9vO.html
03-05-2020||India||1 million tested for Covid in India; 10k recover||The number of people tested for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in India crossed a million on Saturday, up from 38,914 on April 1, which takes the number of tests to almost 770 per million of the population. And the number of recoveries crossed 10,000. On Friday, India tested 74,507 samples, of which around 85% of the tests were done at government labs using the Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR), which is the only diagnostic test for Covid-19 approved by the World Health Organization.“We have made a quantum jump in testing. We plan to ramp it up further to move towards a situation where we can test everyone who needs it. The number of labs doing Covid-19 tests has gone up, with 406 labs -- of which 105 are private ones -- now testing for Covid-19 across states,” said C K Mishra, secretary, environment, and co-chair of the PM’s high-level committee on preparedness for a medical emergency.The health ministry expects testing to cross 100,000 tests a day next week, up from 5,580 a day on April 1.“Positivity remains low except for the 20 cities, which are still a cause of concern as the Covid-19 curve doesn’t appear to be flattening there. The strategy for the future will be ramping up surveillance in these cities so we test every case of influenza-like illness to inform the containment response,” said a health ministry official who asked not to be namedRT-PCR is used for qualitative detection of genetic material called nucleic acid (RNA) from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, and is the most accurate diagnostic test for infection, while other tests, such as rapid antibody tests, are surveillance tools that cannot test for current infection.Among the 304 government labs, 254 use Real-Time RT PCR systems, 42 use TrueNat machines, and use Gene-Xpert cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test (CBNAAT) for Covid-19. Truenat is a small battery-operated machine that can run 32 to 48 samples and produces results in one hour, while CBNAAT machines are widely available in low-resource rural settings, where it is used to test for tuberculosis.India has added two more high throughput systems that are capable of running 1,100-1,200 tests in one shift to the existing two in Noida and Bhubhaneshwar. “Labs in Noida and Bhubaneshwar already have high-throughput systems, another one has been added to Bangalore, and a new one has arrived, which will be installed in National Centres of Disease Control in Delhi to increase testing capacity further,” said Mishra.India has testing kits in stock for another 11-12 days, and the threat of interrupted supply of RNA extraction kits from China is being addressed by domestic suppliers, who now provide 70,000-80,000 kits a day. “With local suppliers coming into play, shortages are no longer an overwhelming concern,” said the health ministry official.The health ministry has taken steps to address the pendency issue, where labs were taking several days to send back results.An examination of national showed Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Delhi being identified as the states with the highest pendency. In Delhi, the National Institute of Biologicals in Noida was identified as a bottleneck, with the lab’s capacity to test 1,000-1,100 samples a day being stretched because of the arrival of samples from both Uttar Pradesh and Delhi. It resulted in around 9,000 results being pending, of which close to 5,000 were from Delhi.“We asked Delhi to withdraw its samples and send them to private labs for testing, and now the problem is sorted. Delayed data entry in some states is still a challenge, but we are working on that,” said the health ministry official, who is part of the team coordinating with states.Public health experts hope more people with symptoms will come forward to get tested following the health ministry order that now allows for home quarantine of mild cases.“People are not stupid, no one wants to die. We have to empower them to protect themselves. Japan now asks people with fever and cough to stay home quarantined and get tested only if the symptoms worsen or don’t go away a week later,” said Mishra.According to HT’s dashboard, the number of infections were 39,911 on Saturday night, with 1,319 deaths and 10,758 recoveries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/1mn-tested-for-covid-in-india-10k-recover/story-SANAO358Z79yqNuGnP6NxN.html
03-05-2020||India||3 Indians in UAE face action over social media posts||Three more Indian expatriates in the United Arab Emirates have either been sacked or suspended from their jobs for Islamophobic social media posts days after the Indian ambassador cautioned citizens against posting inflammatory material online.Chef Rawat Rohit, storekeeper Sachin Kinnigoli and a cash custodian whose identity was withheld by his employer are the latest additions to a list of about 10 Indians who have faced action for their social media posts, Gulf News reported on Saturday.On April 20, Indian ambassador Pavan Kapoor had warned Indian expatriates against such behaviour after the issue of Islamophobic social media posts, especially content showing Islam in a poor light in conjunction with the Covid-19 pandemic, was highlighted my people in several West Asian countries.“India and UAE share the value of non-discrimination on any grounds. Discrimination is against our moral fabric and the Rule of law. Indian nationals in the UAE should always remember this,” Kapoor had tweeted, quoting another tweet from Prime Minister Narendra Modi that said Covid-19 doesn’t “see race, religion, colour, caste, creed, language or borders before striking”.A spokesperson for Azadea Group, which operates a chain of Italian restaurants in Dubai, said chef Rawat Rohit had been suspended and is facing a disciplinary probe, according to Gulf News.Sharjah-based Pneumics Automation suspended its storekeeper Sachin Kinnigoli and withheld his salary. “The matter is under investigation. We have a zero tolerance policy. Anyone found guilty of insulting or showing contempt for someone’s religion will have to bear the consequences,” the firm’s owner said.Dubai-based Transguard Group said it sacked an employee who posted anti-Islamic messages on his Facebook page using the name Vishal Thakur. The employee was handed over to authorities and is in the custody of Dubai Police, a Transguard spokesperson said.The issue of inflammatory posts by Indian expatriates has been in the limelight since it was raised on several occasions by Princess Hend al-Qassimi, a member of the UAE’s royal family.Former Indian ambassador Navdeep Suri has also cautioned Indians about the UAE’s hate speech laws and similar warnings have been issued by Indian missions in other Gulf Cooperation Council states.UAE’s anti-discrimination and anti-hate law prohibits all acts “that stoke religious hatred and/or which insult religion through any form of expression, be it speech or the written word, books, pamphlets or via online media”.Last month, Sharjah-based businessman Sohan Roy had to apologise for a video depicting Islamic clerics leading blindfolded men in skull caps in an adaptation of his poem on religious bigotry, while three other Indians were fired for derogatory social media posts. A police complaint was filed against Sameer Bhandari, CEO of Future Vision Events & Weddings, after he told an Indian job-seeker to “Go back to Pakistan” in a text message.In March, chef Trilok Singh was fired from a restaurant in Dubai for an online threat against a student in Delhi over her views on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-indians-in-uae-face-action-over-social-media-posts/story-4nzIrlTLEWCJE1H32FLKsJ.html
03-05-2020||India||10 special trains took migrants to Bihar, UP and Jharkhand today: Railways||Twenty Shramik Special trains were scheduled to run on Saturday ferrying stranded migrants to Jharkhand, UP, Bihar from the states of Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Gujarat and the five southern states; Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Karnataka, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh. Out of the 20 scheduled special trains, the Indian Railways said only 10 special trains could run on Saturday. The trains scheduled to run on Saturday from the Western Railway zone, Southern Railway, South Western Railway and Central Railway zone were due to ferry at least 20,000 passengers, senior officials said. “Trains are being planned at the request from the states. 10 trains ran today following all the standard protocols,” Railway Protection Force DG Arun Kumar said. “As per information received, various zonal Railways have run around 10 Shramik Special trains today on the demand of various state governments,” Railway Ministry said.Amid demands by states and recognition of the logistical challenges involved in transporting millions of people back to their home states, the Centre on Friday decided to allow special trains — called Shramik Specials — to enable stranded migrants to return home. Five such trains operated on Friday.According to officials, railways are unlikely to run trains originating from containment zones like Delhi, Mumbai and Ahmedabad. “There are no trains planned for now but we are running in nearby places like in Maharashtra trains are being run at other destinations like Bhiwandi and Vasai in Mumbai. Trains will only run to these places when the demand from the state government comes,” the official added. The Railways also announced it will charge for tickets for operating special trains for stranded migrant workers amid coronavirus lockdown. The fare includes the price of regular sleeper class tickets plus superfast charges of Rs 30 and an additional charge of Rs 20 adding that state governments will coordinate and can pay on passengers’ behalf.Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren on Saturday tweeted saying the government should roll back the fare on special trains adding that it was an “injustice to our labourers who are returning home”.The ministry of railways had also clarified that the special trains were planned only for those identified and registered by state governments. “No one under any circumstance should come to Railway Stations looking for trains. We will not issue any tickets to any individual or entertain any request from any group or individual. We will allow only those passengers to board whom state government officials bring to the railway stations,” the ministry said. The railway ministry has said that trains would operate from point-to-point on the request of the concerned state governments. Senior officials would be appointed as nodal officers. It clarified, “The passengers have to be screened by the sending states and only those found asymptomatic will be allowed to travel.” It would also be the responsibility of the sending governments to bring such individuals to the designated stations in sanitized buses, following social distancing norms. All passengers will have to mandatorily wear masks; while meals and drinking water are to be provided, according to the ministry, by the sending government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/20-special-trains-scheduled-to-run-today-to-ferry-migrants-to-bihar-up-and-jharkhand/story-cvPBkeWj055IS1rAqQVqVO.html
03-05-2020||India||In Jaish’s deadly plan, simultaneous suicide attacks in Kashmir on May 11||Pakistan-based terrorist group Jaish-e-Mohammed plans to carry out simultaneous terrorist strikes in Jammu and Kashmir on May 11, according to an intelligence alert issued to security forces in the Union Territory.“The information is that these attacks could be suicide missions and target bases of the army and paramilitary forces in Jammu and Kashmir,” a top counter-terror official in Delhi told Hindustan Times on Saturday.The planned terror strikes come against the backdrop of a spectacular performance by counter-terror teams in Jammu and Kashmir that eliminated 28 terrorists in April alone. The security action had prompted a sharp reaction from Islamabad’s foreign ministry recently, protesting the killing of what it had described as the killing of 29 innocents.Jaish-e-Mohammed founder Maulana Masood Azhar, who has been reported to be terminally ill, has been out of action for several months. His younger brother, Mufti Abdul Rauf Asghar has been running the show at the terror factory and is reported to have been personally involved in planning the multiple terror strikes, he said.On Saturday, according to information available with Indian intelligence agencies, Mufti Abdul Rauf Asghar also had a scheduled meeting with officials of Inter Services Intelligence at Rawalpindi on the outskirts of Pakistan capital Islamabad.Watch: Pakistan’s terror tactic amid Covid-19 crisis explained“I would surmise that Mufti Abdul Rauf Asghar’s meeting with his handlers is about the May 11 terror strikes,” a senior security official in Kashmir said.He said the choice of May 11 for the strikes is designed to coincide with the 17th day of Ramadan when the Battle of Badr was fought and won by a few hundred soldiers in Saudi Arabia. In Islamic history, it is seen as a huge victory in the early days of Islam and a turning point.Intelligence officials said the May 11 strike being planned by the Jaish was expected in view of a spike in infiltration attempts backed by the Pakistan army during the last one month. Many of them were blocked by soldiers of the Indian army and paramilitary forces. Some did succeed.It is estimated that nearly 25-30 Jaish terrorists had managed to sneak into Kashmir valley with help from the Pakistan army.Intelligence reports indicate that more than 70 Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorists are likely to attempt infiltration over the next few weeks, many of them from the Leepa Valley.“Our analysis has indicated that there is often a correlation between spikes in cross-border firing and infiltration attempts at this time of the year,” an army official said, adding that the number of ceasefire violations by the Pakistan army is expected to increase further.Also Read: After proxy war in Kashmir, Pak launches cyber war against India and PM ModiThe officer said it was impossible that these infiltration attempts would not have the active support of the Pakistan army. For one, Pakistan too is in a lockdown mode and there are restrictions on movement due to Covid-19. Secondly, he said, the topography of the region was such that even terrorists would need a break when they reach the line of control before beginning the difficult journey into Kashmir. That is where the launch pads come in.Mufti Asghar Kashmiri oversees infiltrationIntelligence officials said Jaish’s de facto chief Mufti Abdul Rauf Asghar has tasked Afghan war veteran Mufti Asghar Kashmiri to oversee the operational aspects of the infiltration from Leepa valley.Kashmiri is also the chief commander of Jaish’s Kashmir operations and is the so-called Amir of JeM’s Askari (or military wing) in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.Kashmiri, joined Jaish from the Harkat-ul-Mujahideen, and is also responsible for the Jaish’s terror camps in Afghanistan that also train recruits to fight in Kashmir.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/simultaneous-suicide-missions-planned-by-jaish-in-j-k-on-may-11-says-intel/story-477bVZx58VqzrZNi4xQFkI.html
03-05-2020||India||Domestic, international flight ops suspended till May 17||The ban on domestic, international flight operations has been extended till May 17, in line with the nationwide lockdown extension necessitated by the coronavirus outbreak.The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) said the foreign and domestic airlines will be informed about the opening of their operations in due course.“The restriction shall not apply to international all-cargo operations and flights specifically approved by DGCA,” read the circular from the aviation watchdog. Meanwhile, airlines have begun practising mock drills to educate and prepare staff for the new social distancing normal due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Prime Minister Modi has already emphasised the importance of ‘do gaj doori (distance of two yards), saying it should be a mantra for all in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic.On Friday, revising downwards its forecast, global aviation consultancy CAPA projected India’s domestic air traffic at 5.5-7 crore for the current financial year citing structural damage and weakness of customer sentiment becoming more visible.The latest forecast is a sharp downward revision compared to the traffic of 8-9 crore passengers estimated earlier for the same period.Social distancing protocols would constrain airline capacity but demand in the second quarter is expected to be so weak in any case that it is unlikely that traffic would be much higher even if there were no restrictions, it noted.On the same day, PM Modi held a meeting to review plans that could help in making the country’s civil aviation sector more efficient and able to cope with the consequences of the nationwide lockdown and closure of the Indian air space to fight the coronavirus disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/domestic-international-flight-ops-suspended-till-may-17/story-kC13Epkv1rZzI9EtVUK7qK.html
03-05-2020||Editorials||Announce the stimulus, and undertake structural reforms||Over the past week, Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi has held a series of meetings reviewing the state of various economic sectors, the ways in which the current slump can be reversed, and most significantly, the fundamental reforms that can be undertaken in these respective sectors to overcome structural issues. This is important, for once the coronavirus pandemic subsides, there will have to be a singular focus on the economy. There is no doubt that the pandemic will force the economy to press the reset button. India will, in the worst case, witness a recession this year, or in the best case, grow by 1-2%, a projection offered by the chief economic adviser. These figures translate into businesses shutting down; a sharp dip in the profitability of companies which do manage to survive; shrinking incomes for citizens; the collapse of a high number of micro, small and medium enterprises; a spike in unemployment across sectors; a hit to trading arrangements; depleted taxes for the government at a time when expenditure commitments will increase; and an inability to pursue much-needed development goals. The ambition of becoming a $5 trillion economy will recede further. This newspaper has consistently argued that to overcome the distress, the government must come up with a substantial fiscal stimulus package immediately. There is no alternative to enhanced public spending. This has already been delayed inexplicably. But beyond the size and the composition of the stimulus, the PM’s meetings offer hope that this moment can be used as an opportunity to undertake structural reforms. Two areas, in particular, stand out. The first is manufacturing. As countries turn inwards, and many global production hubs seek to relocate from China, India must cut red tape, reform its fundamental factors of production, and encourage businesses which can provide mass employment. To be sure, new ways of doing businesses — including mass manufacturing — will have to be found in keeping with social distancing norms. The second is agriculture. The PM indicated in a meeting on Saturday the need for integrated markets and a new legislative framework for the sector. Fragmented agricultural markets and the Agricultural Produce Market Committee’s framework have long been held farmers hostage, given inordinate power to intermediaries, and undermined India’s potential. If, after the stimulus, the government can use the pandemic to herald long-awaited reforms, it will be the best use of this crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/announce-the-stimulus-and-undertake-structural-reforms/story-U1fEmnbqPwroYkra1I0l2I.html
03-05-2020||Editorials||Transporting migrants: Centre should have devised a cost-sharing plan or taken care of the entire bill||As the national lockdown to combat the coronavirus disease (Covid-19)-sparked crisis was extended for another two weeks on Friday, the Union government announced that the Indian Railways (IR) will start running special trains to ferry stranded labourers from their host to home states. This has been the demand of the migrant workers since the beginning of the lockdown on March 24 because the shutdown of their workplaces has left them with no money to pay for housing and food. In the absence of any transportation, many desperate migrant workers have been walking and cycling impossible distances to the safety of their home towns/villages. The decision to transport migrant workers, however, is turning out to be a new flashpoint between the Centre and states over who will bear the cost of transportation. On May 3, the Indian Railways said that it is the responsibility of the state authorities to collect ticket fares from stranded migrants and students boarding special trains to return to their hometowns and hand over the amount to it or pay the amount from its coffers. The service provider is charging sleeper class fares and an additional Rs 50 for one point-to-point journey. However, there is little clarity over whether states need to book trains, as Jharkhand has done, and pay upfront, or pay later. Left on their devices, different states are trying out different mechanisms for payments: Either raising money or charging it from poor migrant workers. This is because states are already facing huge funds crunch due to the high expenses incurred for tackling the pandemic and revenues have decreased. So many have demanded that the Centre bears the cost of travel. The chief ministers of Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh have spoken out against the decision to burden the states further. But, the Centre has not made any announcement. The payment controversy could have been avoided if the Centre and the two states (host and home) had formulated a cost-sharing plan. While all three parties had enough time to do so since the lockdown was announced almost a month and a half ago, the Centre should have taken the lead in formulating this critical cost-sharing plan to ensure that there is no controversy over what is primarily humanitarian assistance to poor and desperate migrant workers. Better still, it should taken care of the entire bill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/transporting-migrants-centre-should-have-devised-a-cost-sharing-plan-or-taken-care-of-the-entire-bill/story-Qx09jyBxPiDr8ysv0aHJvN.html
