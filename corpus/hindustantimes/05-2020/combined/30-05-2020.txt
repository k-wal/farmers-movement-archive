Living in the times of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) is never going to be the same as life before the pandemic. Given the steady surge of infections, it will take a while to reach a phase that can be called life after the coronavirus. Until a vaccine is found and the virus is dealt with, we will have life alongside the coronavirus (LAC). For LAC, the pause button is no answer, one has to press the reset button. Our minds and modes of living need a reset. It should not be difficult. A recent post-coronavirus survey by Pew Research Centre revealed that 91% of Americans have said that the virus has changed their lives in varying degrees; 86% prayed for an end to the virus; 77% did not want to eat out at a restaurant again, and in this presidential election year, 66% would not be comfortable to line up to vote. That is the impact of the invisible virus across the globe.When we had less than 500 cases of infections in India, 1.3 billion people locked themselves inside their homes since March 25 to keep the virus out. When this number rose to a hundred thousand on May 17, there was a yearning for freedom. Hence, lockdown 4.0 is different from the first one. This yearning is perhaps a statement that we are now ready to deal with the virus as there is much more to life than living in confinement for so long. Experts and government officials say that the fight against the coronavirus is a long haul. The vaccine may take some time in coming, if at all it does. So, this confidence to reset life to deal with the virus should guide people as they await the next set of rules when the current lockdown ends on May 31. The contours of the next version of the lockdown depends on the curve of infections and the conduct of people during the fourth version. Whatever the case, there is no doubt that rules in the social, economic and political domains have to be reset.When the comfort of being in the presence of others is forcibly replaced by that of absence, life has to adjust to that. But at no time should the hyper-individualism of the pre-coronavirus times be allowed to take root again. The essential inter-connectedness of health, of our dependence on each other, so starkly brought out by the pandemic, should inform our attitude and behaviour. While ensuring social distancing, we need to stay connected in a meaningful manner and support each other in every way. Post-coronavirus, classrooms have been replaced by homes, seminars are morphing into webinars, meetings are no more physical. A healthy digital life is emerging though there are issues of equitable access to the tools for all. New habits are the key to life alongside the coronavirus. Albert Camus, writing about the obliteration of a fictional Algerian town in The Plague, said; “The truth is, everyone is bored, and devotes himself to cultivating habits” — habits not in sync with principles of humanity and nature. New norms of living are needed. Maintaining distance, wearing masks and regular washing of hands are cost-effective means to check the transmission of the virus. We need to make these habits a part of life as long as this is required. Life may look more virtual than real.Protecting the lives of the people while reviving the economy is the key challenge. The global economy is facing the most serious onslaught since the Great Depression of the last century. Centres of production and other economic activities should be revived with stringent safeguards in place for those involved. Strict protocols must be put in place and adhered to. Gradualism is better than seeking to rush to peak performance levels too soon. The coronavirus outbreak has exposed the inadequacies of the health care system and has underlined the need for substantial investments in public health infrastructure.Migrant workers are returning home in large numbers amid the uncertainty. We have to step up efforts to retain them where they are at the moment and bring back those who returned home by reassuring them about their future and instilling confidence. The coronavirus outbreak has brought out the best in cooperative federalism in our country with the central- and state-level leadership accommodating each other’s point of view as the situation unfolded, from lockdown 1.0 to 4.0. This spirit should guide the execution of the steps announced for economic revival. The central and state governments have become more visible in fighting the virus than ever before. The third-tier of governance and local communities need to be empowered to deal with such crisis situations for even better results.The historian and author, Yuval Noah Harari, lamented that the global response to Covid-19 has not been ideal. With nations fighting their own battles against the virus, the much-needed collective global response is missing in action, adversely impacting those with low resource bases. This needs to be addressed for better results and to prepare for future shocks.The pandemic has brought into sharp focus the existing inequalities in respect to access to technology, income levels and livelihood vulnerabilities, resulting in varied degrees of pain inflicted by the virus on different sections of society across the globe. Proper lessons need to be learned from this.In sum, the coronavirus is a shock treatment and a stark reminder of the need to reset approaches on the social, political, economic and global fronts besides living in harmony with each other and with nature.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/pressing-the-reset-button-in-times-of-the-coronavirus-pandemic/story-U9clFeVq1pkP3C9BNvoIeO.html

30-05-2020||City||Government-approved stores will soon be able to sell PPE in Maharashtra||Now, protective gear for doctors will be available at select, government-approved medical stores in Mumbai and Thane. At present, Maharashtra has a manufacturing capacity of over 15,000 personal protective equipment (PPE) per day. As per the instruction of the state government, under the Epidemic Diseases Act, all private clinics and medical setups must remain open during the lockdown. However, doctors have complained of lack of PPE, which offer essential protection from the virus. Taking note of this, Food and Drugs Authority (FDA) has ensured the availability of PPE at select chemists. In Mumbai, 122 such shops have permission to sell PPE to doctors. There is no fixed rate for PPE, but would be priced at around Rs 1,000, said JN Mantri, joint commissioner, Maharashtra FDA.“We have requested stores to charge reasonably and they have agreed. At present, we have started with Thane and Mumbai but will expand to other districts,” said Arun Unhale, commissioner, Maharashtra FDA. The Indian Medical Association (IMA) has welcomed the move. “Due to growing demand for PPE, traders are supplying it at a higher price to private hospitals. Many of them are not of adequate quality to ensure safety. But this new policy would be helpful for doctors,” said Dr Avinash Bhonwde, president, IMA Maharashtra. The production of PPE in Maharashtra has increased by almost 15 times since March. From four manufacturers, the number has increased to 19, taking the total daily production of PPE to over 15,000. “We have ensured that we have enough number of PPE for medical staffers in the state. Recently, after receiving complaints about poor quality of PPE, we raided a medical store in Pune,” said Mantri.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/government-approved-stores-will-soon-be-able-to-sell-ppe-in-maharashtra/story-QVFH1vmApIiRX0taShDAkK.html

Civic commissioner Vijay Singhal said a police case will be registered against the director of these private hospitals if they flout the rule. On Friday, the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) registered cases against three private hospitals in Mumbra for refusing to admit patients. Singhal said, “The state government has given strict guidelines to the private hospitals, which are non-Covid hospitals, to not reject any patient. We have also issued directives to private hospitals to admit symptomatic suspected Covid-19 patients. The hospitals can admit these patients in the isolation ward and start treatment. Once their condition is stable and if there is a need, Covid-19 test can be done.” If the patient tests negative, the hospital where he is admitted will continue his treatment. If he tests positive, he should be shifted to a Covid hospital. “If any hospital does not follow the directives and rejects a patient or asks the family to shift the patient elsewhere, we will file a police case against the director of the hospital,” Singhal added. BJP corporator Narayan Pawar has demanded that TMC should take action against big hospitals too for rejecting patients or charging a huge amount. “TMC was quick to take action against three small private hospitals in Mumbra. What about big hospitals? We have complained against several hospitals but no action has yet been taken.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/non-covid-hospitals-cannot-refuse-patients-thane-civic-body/story-esrwgIG1QH4OL5wUo9XSPO.html

The woman was his second wife. The deceased, Shalan Kharat, was living with her husband, Bala Kharat, 38, a ragpicker, and two children. Shalan often used to quarrel with him over money and jewellery he had given his first wife. On Friday night, they fought over the same issue. Later in the night, Bala strangled her to death with a rope and fled. Senior inspector from Khadakpada police station, A Pawar, said, “When the children woke up in the morning, they found their mother dead. We have registered a murder case against her husband, who is absconding.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/man-kills-wife-after-fight-over-jewellery-flees/story-qSZR5adQVXrZTbaKh0L0xK.html
30-05-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai resident distributes 2,000 masks for free to Covid frontline workers||A resident of Bhandup has distributed approximately 2,000 masks over the past month, to police officers, civic staff and other essential services workers. After crowd-sourcing bedsheets from friends, relatives and neighbours, Kaustubh Deshmukh collaborated with a local tailor and the non-governmental organisation Groups of Disabled (GODs) to make “colourful and fancy masks”. Deshmukh distributes these masks in the suburbs and says they’re popular.“I go around from Thane to Airoli and Ghatkopar, returning to Bhandup. Wherever I see police or those in need of masks, I simply provide them with some depending on their requirement,” said Deshmukh, who works as a manager at a private company. He’s given some of the masks to street vendors and asked them to distribute the masks for free. Next week, Deshmukh will meet with the Mumbai Police to give approximately 1,000 masks made of bedsheets, for police constables. He also plans to meet with the Brihanmumbai Electric Supply & Transport (BEST) undertaking, which runs the city’s buses, to provide drivers and conductors on duty with his masks.“For those working in the frontline, we will provide green masks similar to what’s used in hospitals. My intention behind this drive was that, even if 50 people like me can provide masks, we would have ample,” Deshmukh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-resident-distributes-2-000-masks-for-free-to-covid-frontline-workers/story-OU57e1rMl4v14R4IQshETP.html
30-05-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai sizzles at 35.7°C, season’s highest temp so far||The city and suburbs both recorded their highest day temperature this season so far on Saturday. The Santacruz weather observatory, representative of the suburbs, recorded 35.7 degrees Celsius, almost 2 degree Celsius above normal. Up till Saturday, the maximum temperature had not surpassed the 35 degree Celsius mark in the suburbs during May. Colaba weather station, representative of south Mumbai, recorded 35.4 degrees Celsius, a little over a degree Celsius above normal. The night temperature was also the highest in five years at 29.2 degrees Celsius in the suburbs, the same as the highest minimum recorded during May 2016.The weather bureau said light overnight drizzling was recorded across the city and suburbs between Friday night and Saturday morning. “A partly cloudy sky during the day led to a high minimum temperature while clear conditions later in the day led to land heating which increased day temperatures,” said an official from the India Meteorological Department (IMD).Meanwhile, IMD updated its district-wise rainfall forecast for June 1 stating ‘very light to light rain’ was expected for Mumbai, Thane and Palghar on Monday while ‘light to moderate rain’ has been predicted for all three areas on Tuesday. “The likely formation of a weather system over southeast Arabian Sea, which is likely to intensify and move northwestwards towards Maharashtra and Gujarat coast will pave way for pre-monsoon rain,” the official added.Meanwhile, private weather forecasting agency Skymet announced that all conditions were met for southwest monsoon onset over Kerala on Saturday. However, both IMD and secretary of ministry of earth sciences M Rajeevan denied the claim. “The news about monsoon onset over Kerala in social media is not correct. Monsoon has not arrived over Kerala yet,” tweeted Rajeevan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-sizzles-at-35-7-c-season-s-highest-temp-so-far/story-Ib2TmsvdTfoYeSCDlJxmlK.html
30-05-2020||Mumbai||Surgical masks sold at inflated rates in Mumbai despite price cap by Centre||Despite the price of two- and three-layer surgical masks being capped by the Centre, many medical stores continue to sell the masks at inflated prices. While the Food and Drugs Authority (FDA) has conducted raids in Pune, no action has been taken against medical stories in Mumbai that are charging higher prices for masks.In March, when Maharashtra reported its first case of Covid-19, the demand for masks increased by 400% in the state and its retail price doubled. On March 21, the Union ministry of consumer affairs said that the maximum retail price for two- and three-ply ‘surgical’ face masks must be capped at Rs 8 and Rs 10 per piece respectively.Since then, FDA, the apex regulating body, has raided seven medical stores in Maharashtra for overpricing of masks. The highest number of raids (four) were conducted in Pune. There have been no raids conducted in Mumbai. JN Mantri, joint commissioner, Maharashtra FDA, said no consumer complaints have been made in Mumbai. “We haven’t received any complaint from the city yet. We have conducted one raid in Thane. People can call at 1800-222-365 to file complaints,” he said.HT checked with leading medical stores in Mumbai and found surgical masks continue to be sold at inflated prices, ranging from Rs 20 to Rs 30. If the medical store is near a Covid hospital, the price increases further.“The demand of the masks is the highest near the hospitals. So the medical stores sell it at the maximum price range. Sometimes, the price gets as high as Rs 50 but there is no one to keep an eye on them despite the capping,” said Abhay Pandey, national president, All Food and Drug Licence Holder Foundation (AFDLHF).Explaining FDA’s process, Mantri said, “On [receiving] tip-offs, we send officers as customers to buy masks. Then we catch them [sellers] red-handed. Though we don’t seize the masks, we give warnings and transfer the cases to National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority.”Activists said citizens’ rights are being violated as the arbitrarily-raised prices reduce people’s access to medical amenities during the pandemic. “Till January, surgical masks cost only Rs 2. Firstly, the cap imposed on the pricing is much higher. Secondly, it is not even implemented. In Singapore, the government has installed mask-vending machines, which provide masks free of cost. In India, Covid-19 has turned into a business,” said Anjali Damania, founder-trustee of Voice of Indian Taxpayers, a non-governmental organisation.Sunita Mishra, 34-year-old, a private nurse, said, “I have to take care of two bedridden patients, one in the morning and the other one in the evening. So, I can’t repeat the same mask for both patients. This costs me Rs50 daily. Then, while going out for groceries, I have to put on my third mask. Every month, I spend around Rs 2,000 only on masks.” As per the World Health Organization (WHO), masks are essential for the prevention of Covid-19. Last month, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) made wearing masks when outdoors compulsory to reduce the spread of the infection.No cap on N95 masksThough N95 masks have been declared essential commodity under the Essential Commodities Act, there is no cap on its price. Private hospitals, nursing homes and small clinics are forced to buy these masks at exorbitant prices, which is usually added to a patient’s bill. “NPPA [National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority], the regulating body, is supposed to bring the mask under its cap as an essential commodity, but it hasn’t so far, which is leading to black marketing and hoarding,” said Damania. The mask, which was priced at Rs 20 prior to the outbreak, now costs Rs 350 in Mumbai. For those buying in bulk, traders sell N95 masks for Rs 274 per piece. Last week, NPPA held a meeting with makers, importers and suppliers of N95 masks to maintain parity in prices. “Haffkine Institute provided the masks at Rs 42. If the private companies don’t reduce the rate after warning, we will bring it under cap,” said an NPPA officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/surgical-masks-sold-at-inflated-rates-in-mumbai-despite-price-cap-by-centre/story-O62OTgz78X9c2UgkJOSQKN.html
30-05-2020||Mumbai||HC asks state to reply to PIL on state of migrants||A division bench of the Bombay high court (HC), while hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (Citu) seeking relief for migrant workers opting for special Shramik trains or buses to return to their hometowns, has asked the state to file a detailed report by June 2.The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice KK Tated has asked the state to elaborate on the procedure that a migrant worker is required follow to be eligible to leave Maharashtra, the waiting period thereafter for a migrant to board a train or bus, nature of shelter being made available for them and the provisions made available for sustenance.Citu, represented by senior counsel Gayatri Singh along with advocates Kranti LC and Ronita Bhattacharya Bector, informed the court that migrant workers who had applied to leave the state are left in the dark about the status of their applications and are being forced to live in unhygienic shelters without food and other basic essentials till they can board the trains or buses.In response, additional solicitor general Anil Singh on behalf of the Central government informed the bench that an order of the Supreme Court passed on May 28 detailed on the measures to be taken for the migrant workers, and that all states were asked to implement the same and file reports.After perusing the apex court order, the bench noted that directions were issued to all states for simplifying and expediting registration process for migrant workers and to provide helpdesks at places where they are stranded.As the SC is to hear the petition on June 5, the bench observed, “At this stage, neither are we empowered nor do we wish to make any order contrary to the spirit of the order of the Supreme Court. However, having regard to the peculiar local conditions, we consider it fit and proper to call upon the State to file a report.”The bench further stated that it had come across photographs in newspapers showing congregation of migrant workers not only on railway platforms but also on the streets adjoining railway stations. “Such congregation, if allowed, would run counter to the object, for which the lockdown has been imposed,” said the bench. The bench has posted the matter for hearing on June 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-asks-state-to-reply-to-pil-on-state-of-migrants/story-mW2yl7BmutTRn5cAPzq94N.html
30-05-2020||Mumbai||15L migrants sent back; 3,459 stranded Indians arrived in state: Maharashtra govt||Maharashtra government has sent around 15 lakh migrant workers to their respective states so far. Of them, 9.82 lakh workers were sent through special Shramik trains and 5.08 lakh migrants were sent by state transport (ST) buses, according to information shared by the state government.In addition, 3,459 Indians stranded in 17 different countries have been brought back to Maharashtra in 27 flights under Vande Bharat Mission. All of them have been kept under institutional quarantine facility developed by the state government for 14 days, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said on Saturday. Of the 3,459 citizens, 1,137 are from Mumbai, 1,572 are from other parts of the state and the remaining 750 are from other states. Thackeray said more stranded Indians are being brought back under the mission as six more flights are expected to land in Mumbai till June 7.The stranded Indians are brought from Britain, Singapore, Philippines, the United States, Bangladesh, Malaysia, Kuwait, Ethiopia, Afghanistan, Oman, South Africa, Indonesia, Netherlands, Japan, Sri Lanka, Myanmar and Tanzania. Thackeray said all those who are from Mumbai have been kept in institutional quarantine facilities developed at various hotels in the city while those are from other parts of the state have been sent to the respective districts where they have been kept in quarantine facilities. “We have also kept all those, who are not from Maharashtra but have not got passes for entry from the respective states, in Mumbai at quarantine facilities,” the chief minister said.State home minister Anil Deshmukh said over 9.82 lakh migrant workers have been sent with the help of 696 special trains which started from May 1. Of the trains, a majority of 374 departed for Uttar Pradesh, 169 trains for Bihar, 33 trains for Madhya Pradesh, 30 trains for Jharkhand, 13 trains for Orissa and six trains departed for Karnataka so far.The state government has also sent 5,08,803 migrants to their respective states in 41,874 trips of ST buses. The destinations include Telangana, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Chattisgarh, Karnataka among other. The government has spent ₹94.66 crore on sending migrant workers through buses, stated a release issued by the chief minister’s office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/15l-migrants-sent-back-3-459-stranded-indians-arrived-in-state-maharashtra-govt/story-IBRx5vVYVIuSX41faZftOO.html
30-05-2020||Mumbai||World No Tobacco Day: Docs say this is the right time to quit||While smokers are more vulnerable to the novel coronavirus due to their compromised lungs, doctors said that the national lockdown has pushed many to quit smoking.On the eve of World No Tobacco Day, which is observed on May 31, doctors warned smokers to avoid the habit even after lockdown as Sars-Cov-2— the virus that causes Covid-19 is going to remain a threat for a longer period.In comparison to non-smokers, regular smokers can have co-morbid health issues like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with compromised lungs which are more vulnerable to contracting the infection. Along with that, they are at greater risk of developing heart diseases and asthma which, as recent data has shown, can make increase the chance of falling sick to the virus.“Thus, the chances of smokers catching Covid-19 is higher. Also, they have higher chances of developing pneumonia if the virus gets into the body. Due to underlying health issues, the chances of mortality are also high among the smokers,” said Dr Om Srivastava, city-epidemiologist. A recent study conducted by among 650 smokers has found that 38% reported having quit tobacco during this period. Of these, 51% were forced to quit because of the lockdown and the coronavirus scare. The study, conducted by LifeFirst, is part of a tobacco dependence treatment programme initiated by Narotam Sekhsaria Foundation in collaboration with Salaam Bombay Foundation.On May 26, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended tobacco users to stop the habit as a precautionary measure against Covid-19. Dr Himanshu A Gupte, general manager, Narotam Sekhsaria Foundation, said, “It is thus evident that this is the best time to quit tobacco use and people are willing and also making attempts. Tobacco products not being available and becoming more expensive were among the common reasons that impacted smokers.”Tobacco users, particularly those who use smokeless tobacco, can be instrumental in spreading the disease through spitting. Covid-19 spreads through small droplets from the nose or mouth, which are dispersed when an infected person cough, sneeze, speech, exhalation or spitting.“As per research, these droplets can survive for hours. So, smoking increases the chances of spreading the virus further among other people,” said Dr Gautam Bhansali, consultant physician at Bombay Hospital.A 32-year-old from Borivali who recently quit smoking after 11 years said that the lockdown gave her an opportunity to quit smoking. “I have stopped going out and I can’t smoke at home due to the presence of my parents. In the first week, whenever I had the urges of smoking, I ate a lot of junk food. But after 21 days, I felt better,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/world-no-tobacco-day-docs-say-this-is-the-right-time-to-quit/story-sd6FkqanW3jivyejQemVYJ.html
30-05-2020||Chandigarh||Jagraon Bridge: Fearing cave-in, Ludhiana MC changes retaining wall design, deadline extended||Fearing a road cave-in at the closed leg of the Jagraon Bridge, the municipal corporation (MC) has changed the foundation design of the retaining wall and the approach road being established at the bridge site.Mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu visited the spot on Saturday morning and directed officials and the contractor to complete the project before July 14. Earlier, June 30 was the deadline.Earlier, several NGOs of the city warned the civic body that they would observe the fourth ‘death anniversary’ of the bridge if the authorities failed to complete the project by July 14. MC officials claim after cracks started to develop at the closed leg of the bridge adjoining the approach road site, the MC officials consulted experts of the Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College (GNDEC) and the foundation design has now been changed for avoiding any road cave-in incident. MC superintending engineer (SE) HS Bhullar said, “Cracks had developed at the closed leg on Wednesday, following which the site was got inspected by experts of the GNDEC. The experts said the road portion might cave in if the foundation design is not changed. The design has now been changed and the work will be completed by July 10.”The railways has also been asked to complete the pending works so that the bridge could be opened for traffic after the construction of the retaining wall and approach roads, said Bhullar. Sandhu said all efforts were being made to complete the project at the earliest so that residents could heave a sigh of relief from traffic woes. The contractor has been told to expedite the work, the mayor added. Under the project, the MC has to construct the retaining wall of the bridge and increase the width of road approaching the railway overbridge (from Gurdwara Dukhniwaran side towards Durga Mata Mandir) by three metres.The MC had earlier started the construction on January 30 and it was due to be completed by April 14. But the project was halted after curfew was announced by the government on March 23. The construction work restarted on April 29 and it was said that the work is expected to complete by June 20. But the project has now been further delayed. In July 2016, the railways had closed one leg of the bridge, which was leading to traffic chaos in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/jagraon-bridge-fearing-cave-in-ludhiana-mc-changes-retaining-wall-design-deadline-extended/story-T0nk9nSNvsa95uBNV469aJ.html
30-05-2020||Mumbai||South Mumbai wards keep Covid count in check||Even as experts and bureaucrats have pointed to Mumbai’s high population density and congestion as factors contributing to the high incidence of Covid-19 cases, two wards in south Mumbai are among those with the lowest number of cases despite having unfavourable conditions. B ward (Bhendi Bazaar, Mohammad Ali Road, Dongri, Pydhonie) and C ward (Kalbadevi, Chira Bazaar) have recorded fewer than 500 cases each.Despite a high population density and cramped homes, B ward has recorded 484 cases and 112 recoveries so far. C ward has also recorded 112 recoveries out of 412 reported cases. B ward, with an area of about 2 square kilometres, has a population of about 1.28 lakh. C ward has a similar population density in an area of 1.8 square kilometres.Authorities and elected representatives of both wards have attributed the relatively limited spread of Covid-19 to the lack of slums in these areas and citizens strictly adhering to lockdown guidelines, rules of quarantine and physical distancing.A senior civic official said, “These areas in south Mumbai are among those where citizens know they will be in a bad situation collectively if they do not take care. Since day one, everybody stayed indoors, markets were better managed, citizens followed strict rules of containment zones if cases were found.” Nitin Arte, assistant municipal commissioner of B ward, said, “There are a lot of international travellers in my ward. So I was very concerned. In the first few weeks itself, we began to trace international flyers, check their travel history, quarantine them and their families. That helped the situation right in the beginning.” Arte said the maximum number of fever camps were arranged in the initial days, which helped prevent suspected cases from socialising in the community.Amin Patel, the legislator from this area and whose jurisdiction covers all of B ward and a part of C ward, said, “As for B ward, there are many open markets that attract buyers especially during festivals [like Eid]. This ward has a high Muslim population. So in March itself we segregated the markets and what used to function on one road, was spread out to four roads.” An officer from C ward said, “There are pockets of high population density in this ward, and there are also large commercial areas, which are closed due to the lockdown. This helped the overall figure of cases in the ward to remain under control. There is a high floating population here that is not coming to the ward due to the lockdown.”Atul Shah, corporator and ward committee chairman of C and D wards, said, “There are a few pockets in C ward that have cluster cases. I have already written to the municipal commissioner expressing concern about these pockets. But the situation in the rest of the ward is better. We do not have too many contact cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/south-mumbai-wards-keep-covid-count-in-check/story-kPn03IXMJvbinWBmIW8jXO.html
30-05-2020||Mumbai||After R N Cooper, KEM, Nair hospitals ask UG students to join Covid fight||A day after Andheri’s RN Cooper Hospital (HBT Medical College) issued a circular requesting its third- and fourth-year Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) batches to return to campus and help the hospital with Covid-19 work, MBBS students of KEM Hospital (Seth GS Medical College) and BYL Nair Hospital (TN Medical College) have received similar directions from their institutes.While Cooper Hospital had released an official circular in this matter, students of KEM Hospital received messages over WhatsApp asking them to voluntarily join the medical team.“We know the BMC (Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation) has been thinking about this for a while but didn’t know that the institutes were going to implement it too. Nobody knows what sort of work the students will be expected to do,” said the parent of a third-year student from KEM Hospital.In the message circulated on Saturday, students were informed that they will mostly be given counselling and other ground-level work, and will have no direct contact with patients. “For now, students living in Mumbai and hostelites currently stuck in Mumbai have been invited to join the workforce. Only interested students can approach the dean (academics) and the job will be explained well,” states the message.The circular further mentions that the number of days served by each student on Covid-19 duty will be considered part of their bond service, and will accordingly be deducted from the compulsory bond service they have to clear once they graduate. “All the students will mostly be paid ₹30,000 a month as stated by the government,” the message reads.Some students said they were happy to help. “The message clearly mentions that the job will be more of counselling work. Considering it to be our duty, I won’t mind helping,” said a third-year student.BYL Nair Hospital also requested MBBS students to join relief efforts as ‘Covid warriors’. Nair Hospital dean, Dr Mohan Joshi, in a circular, on Saturday informed students that their transport, accommodation and food will be taken care of by the hospital if they join.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/after-r-n-cooper-kem-nair-hospitals-ask-ug-students-to-join-covid-fight/story-MjvkRk3jh59s4sAZ0J6obI.html

30-05-2020||Delhi||Helps, car cleaners, cooks turn labourers as housing societies shun them||It is 10am on Saturday and 33-year-old Gayatri Devi is in a queue with over two dozen men and women to collect her safety gear from the contractor at a west Delhi construction site. She is new to the site. Until the lockdown, her mornings were spent in sweeping, mopping and washing utensils at two households, where she worked as domestic help. But today will be a first --- of lifting bricks and carrying loads at the construction site. “I used to do the household chores in four houses in Paschim Vihar. From March 17, my employers asked me not to come to work because of the coronavirus scare. I called them all on May 1, asking if I could resume work but none of them allowed me back. Since then, I have lost the job at one house and the other three employers are either evading my calls or asking me to wait for some more weeks,” Devi said.Many like Devi, who were earlier employed as house helps, cooks, car cleaners, gardeners and hawkers, have lost their livelihoods in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic and are now turning up at construction sites across the city looking for work. Many of them were unable to return to their villages in other states -- the interstate bus and train services have only started recently -- and are desperate for work.Ram Kishore, used to wash cars in Janakpuri, is now working as a labourer at another site. “I have never worked as a labourer, but I was running out of money and finally managed to find this job. It has just been two days but the contractor has agreed to pay me a week’s wages in advance, which will help me sail through for some time. People stopped stepping out and gated colonies were not allowing us to enter to resume our work. Till when can we hang on to the hope that they will call us back? We need something to survive,” he said.A senior PWD official said the a lot of first-time workers are being engaged at different project sites, but their work is limited to unskilled labour only. “Some of the experienced labour hands have returned to their home towns after Shramik Special trains were started. So there remains a scarcity of workforce. The inexperienced workers are limited to performing unskilled work such as moving construction materials from one place to another and digging work, among others,” the official said, requesting anonymity.Contractors with the public works department (PWD) and Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) confirmed many first-timers have joined their workforce as unskilled labourers. These people are being recruited for lifting and transferring construction material and cleaning the site and are paid around ₹500 to ₹600 a day. The contractors say they are also benefitting from these new recruits as they are filling up for labourers who have left for their home towns.“We had a requirement of 150 labourers in March, but the work was stopped after the lockdown. Even though we are providing in-situ living arrangements for labourers, the first batch of 28 workers left the site in the second week of April and now after the government started trains to neighbouring states, 79 more have left,” Prashant Prajapati, a contractor with the DMRC, said.After Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the a nationwide lockdown starting March 25, to control the spread of the infectious Covid-19, the national capital saw a mass exodus of migrant workers who wanted to return to their home towns. With factories and small scale industries shut, a large majority of these workers were jobless overnight. While in the initial days, many started walking to their native places, in the absence of all other modes of transport, over the last two weeks, the state governments of Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana are arranging for buses to ferry natives home. The resumption of train services has also helped migrant workers leave Delhi.A contractor who works with the PWD said \many people who had no experience of working at a construction site have joined the workforce in the last one week at different construction projects such as Barapullah phase-3 elevated corridor, tunnel road project near Pragati Maidan, Shastri Park and Seelampur flyover project among others.“There is a shortage of labour in the market hence anyone who is willing to work is welcome. It is hard to arrange for labourers these days. Most of those working at construction sites are migrant labourers from UP, Bihar, Odisha, Jharkhand and Madhya Pradesh. Some of them had already gone even before the lockdown happened while many left during exodus in April and later in May after relaxations were given,” the contractor, who wished not to be named, said.He added that this workforce is also temporary. They will return to their original work places once things get back to normal.The PWD is helming some of important projects such as construction of 1.2-km-long tunnel between Purana Qila road near Mathura Road and the Ring Road, which is part of ITPO Pragati Maidan Redevelopment Project; Barapullah phase-3 elevated corridor; Ashram underpass; flyovers at Seelampur and Shastri Park; and Benito-Juarez Road underpass in south Delhi. The deadline and the cost of the projects has already been extended and increased because of the lockdown.The Delhi Metro on the other hand, has six construction sites across the city. This includes the phase-4 projects as well as the Airport Express Line expansion in Dwarka. PWD’s engineer-in-chief PK Vats said, “Construction work has been resumed at different project sites and all the guidelines are being followed. There is an issue of labourers but it is being managed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/helps-car-cleaners-cooks-turn-labourers-as-housing-societies-shun-them/story-c4xsnXdxoonurkT2nTiCWN.html
30-05-2020||City||Delhi Cong leaders helping migrants by arranging transport||New Delhi: Delhi Congress leaders are stepping up to help migrant labourers and visitors stuck in the national capital to reach their hometowns in the neighbouring states. Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee (DPCC) vice president Abhishek Dutt on Saturday arranged 14 buses to ferry migrant labourers and people who had reached the city for treatment at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), to take them to their hometowns. These buses carried nearly 300 passengers to different locations in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh.“Ever since a migrant screening centre was opened in Lajpat Nagar, we have seen a large number of migrant labourers coming in, who could not be accommodated in trains and buses arranged by the government and they were desperate to get to their villages,” said Dutt. These buses carried elderly citizens, couples with children, differently-abled people and women, who will be dropped off at districts such as Begusarai, Madhubani, Muzaffarpur, Rae Bareli, Damoh and Chattarpur, by Sunday.“The service was free of cost and all the social distancing norms were followed while seating the passengers. All the passengers were screened for their temperatures and they will reach their destinations by Sunday,” said Dutt.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-cong-leaders-helping-migrants-by-arranging-transport/story-QJzlrNGZzj57Gr1qeqaKIP.html

30-05-2020||Mumbai||Desk separators, disinfection tunnels, face mask dispensers — Architects offer solutions for offices||How do we get back to crowded offices with colleagues sitting in close proximity to each other? How do we assemble in common areas and have lunch with several others seated in the cafeteria? As firms prepare to resume work, Mumbai-based architects have now created an open-source handbook for businesses to adopt affordable, easy-to-execute solutions that can be retrofitted in existing office spaces post lockdown.The ‘Back to Work: Rethinking, re-evaluating, retrofitting for safer workplaces’ handbook has been created by the co-founders of The Blank Slate, an architectural firm. The guide includes interventions to be adopted at entrances, lobbies, workstations, conference rooms, cabins, dining areas, and restrooms.For workstations, the handbook suggests reserving chairs and tables for use by a single person, eliminating alternate desks from usage or setting up panels to divide the desks, if elimination is not possible, and creation of solo-work corners.It also suggests making use of foot-operated sanitiser dispensers at entrances to limit contact, disinfection tunnels to sanitise those entering the building, face mask dispensers, face recognition systems, and automated doors.For conference rooms that are frequently used for meetings, the handbook suggests the use of single-seater sofas or fixed chairs at a distance, protective sheets to cover contact areas, one user to operate the projector, and immediate cleaning after the meeting is over.Bina Bhatia, principal architect and founder, The Blank Slate, said, “We have looked at providing two types of solutions – one is design-based and the second is problematic where we also look at densities and staggered timings as a solution.”Co-founder Pratik Daulat said, “We have also looked at simple solutions like signages that look at one-way circulation of employees so there is adherence to social distancing.”While the handbook can be referred to by all offices of different scales, it can also be adopted for hospitality spaces, they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/desk-separators-disinfection-tunnels-face-mask-dispensers-architects-offer-solutions-for-offices/story-IpHOj5Dv2lgINbmeG5X24J.html
30-05-2020||City||Feroze Gandhi Colony murder: Police probe gang rivalry, links to liquor mafia||Gurugram: A day after a 38-year-old mobile shop owner was shot dead in Feroze Gandhi Colony, the police on Saturday said that they were probing his links to gangster Binder Gujjar, suggesting that the murder could be related to gang rivalry. Several crime investigation teams have initiated a probe to trace the suspects. A post-mortem examination conducted on Saturday revealed that the victim was shot 30 times. The police said the victim, Vikas Dureja alias Vicky alias Anda, was a close aide of Gujjar and had been involved in some of his business dealings since Gujjar was arrested last year by the Mumbai crime branch for an alleged conspiracy to kill his rival Sandeep Gadoli. A police official privy to the investigation, requesting anonymity, said, “We are looking into Gujjar’s business dealings in real estate and liquor and trying to find out if the victim was actively involved in the ‘handling’ any of these deals. Some of Gujjar’s associates were smuggling liquor in Delhi-NCR during the lockdown. It is possible that a rival gang wanted to usurp his territory and get into illegal liquor smuggling in the city by plotting this murder.”The police said they are also probing if Sandeep Gadoli’s henchmen had planned the murder as an act of possible revenge for Gadoli’s killing. The rivalry between Gujjar and Gadoli had resulted in a turf war lasting for several years and leading to several inter-gang killings.On Friday around 2.45pm, Dureja was on his way to his office when unidentified suspects had rained bullets at him after blocking his way in Feroze Gandhi Colony. The victim had tried to reverse his car when an SUV, in which at least three suspects were seated, rammed his car from behind. The suspects had fired gunshots at a close range at his car and he had succumbed to injuries from multiple gunshot wounds on the spot. The police had recovered 27 gunshot cartridges from the spot. Deepak Mathur, forensic expert, who conducted the autopsy, said, “The victim sustained 30 gunshot wounds on his neck, trunk, abdomen, chest and forearms and succumbed to injuries.”The police have registered a case of murder against unidentified suspects after the victim’s wife did not name anyone in the FIR. Preet Pal Sangwan, the assistant commissioner of police (ACP), crime, said, “The suspects are yet to be identified. We are yet to arrive on the evidence of the victim’s involvement in criminal activities. The police are looking at all angles, including gang rivalry.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/feroze-gandhi-colony-murder-police-probe-gang-rivalry-links-to-liquor-mafia/story-HLJrAMFB2QnQ6rPTCJCkFO.html

Besides, farmers have been allowed to keep seeds of PR variety, and 29 samples of such seeds have been sent for testing by the department, at its own cost. Apart from this, stock registers, sale bills and bills received are also being checked.PR-128 and PR-129 breeds of paddy seeds have been released by PAU, Ludhiana, this year. These seeds are not available privately, and farmers are cultivating them on experimental basis by purchasing them from the Krishi Vigyan Kendar in Fatehgarh Sahib, Ropar, Narayangarh and PAU.The district has 28,000 hectares of area under paddy and 1,200 hectares under basmati, thus requiring 6,000 quintal seeds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mohali-dc-forms-teams-to-check-quality-of-kharif-crop-seeds/story-X0quLepYuCQPX1Z176TbkJ.html

The surge takes the city’s Covid-19 tally to 677 cases, according to the state health bulletin. This is the first time in the city as well as in Haryana that over 157 cases have been reported in 24 hours. Haryana’s cumulative number of positive cases stands at 1,923 with Gurugram contributing nearly 35% to the overall figure.The previous highest single-day spike of 115 Covid-19 cases was recorded on Friday. From about 317 Covid-19 cases on May 26, the numbers have shot up by 377 cases in the last three days. On Thursday, over 68 fresh cases were reported. The numbers increased to 115 on Friday and 157 on Saturday, taking the tally to 667 cases.Out of these, 224 patients have been discharged and 450 cases are undergoing treatment in various hospitals or are under home isolation. The total number of deaths in the city stands at three.Seeing the surge in the number of Covid-19 cases the district administration, on Saturday, issued a statement that the majority of the cases are asymptomatic and do not need special medical attention other than periodic observation at home or institution. It said that a detailed Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) will be issued for sampling, home isolation and containment zones etc.Health officials said that due to ease in Lockdown 4.0 and inter-state movement between Delhi and Gurugram, the number of coronavirus cases have gone up. They said that it is likely that with the reopening of areas outside containment zones from June 1, as per the guidelines issued by Union ministry of home affairs guidelines on late Saturday evening, the number will increase even further. The administration, however, in its statement said that there is adequate medical preparedness and all the shortcomings noticed in hospitals or while collecting samples have been streamlined.“The numbers will go up in Gurugram as more people will start commuting. Contact tracing will remain the focal point, while ensuring that Covid-19 patients with symptoms are not denied treatment by any private hospital. We are also increasing the capacity of our critical care facility in hospitals like Medeor Hospital, IMT Manesar to at least 150 beds. Private hospitals have also started taking Covid-19 positive patients,” said Dr Jaswant Singh Punia, chief medical officer(CMO).Health care workers and patients going to hospitals continue to be another group of higher risk infection. Data shows that more than 30 health care workers have been infected with SARS-CoV-2(the virus that causes Covid-19) in the last two months. Also, cases have been reported in May, where patients undergoing treatment for other medical illnesses contracted the virus in the hospitals. “This is a major concern,” said a member of the rapid response team.Box: Rise in Covid-19 cases in GurugramMarch 30 : 22April 25: 65May 26: 317May 30: 677||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-records-highest-single-day-spike-of-157-cases-total-count-at-677/story-0vrE713eynaRci1R7slXNP.html
30-05-2020||Gurugram||Despite being made mandatory, wearing a mask not a priority for many Gurugram residents||While wearing a mask when stepping out of the house has been made mandatory by the state government and is also considered as the primary defense against contracting the coronavirus disease, many people in Gurugram are still seen without masks. Many residents said that a lot of people are not following preventive measure and are visiting public spaces without proper face covers. Be it morning walkers enjoying the morning air or people shopping in Sadar Bazar, many people can be spotted without a mask even as the number of Covid-19 in the district keeps rising. In the last three days, nearly 350 cases have been reported in the district. Members of the city market associations said many people often take offense when asked to wear masks. “I asked two-three young men in the Sector 22 market to wear masks, but they objected to my request and even got a bit aggressive. This has happened before also, so now we prefer to offer masks only to those who are willing to take it,” said Rakesh Malik, president, Sector 22 market association.A shopkeeper in Sector 23, who sells shoes, said he has placed some disposable masks at his shop for customers, however, many choose not to wear it.On Wednesday, the state government had announced that anyone found not wearing masks in public spaces or spitting in open would have to pay a fine of ₹500. The administration said that it has formed teams to ensure that people across the city wear masks. “Our teams are monitoring public spaces and fines to 126 persons (till Saturday evening) have been issued for not wearing masks and spitting in public spaces. We will continue to carry on such inspections. We are also using social media and other traditional platforms to reach out to people and make them aware of preventive measures against Covid-19,” said Amit Khatri, deputy commissioner, Gurugram. Despite the stress by authorities on wearing masks, many choose not to cover their faces at all prompting some to call out such behaviour on social media. “We are horribly irresponsible as human beings. I had a long discussion with my neighbour who was not wearing a mask and downplayed the tragedy and blamed the government (sic),” wrote Rohit Mishra, a city resident on the micro-blogging site Twitter. Medical experts reiterated that wearing a mask is crucial to halt the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. “This is a droplet infection and it is important to prevent these droplets from entering the body. At present there is no vaccine against Covid-19, so wearing a mask is important. Wearing a mask correctly is equally important as many times the mouth is covered but the nose is exposed,” said Dr Vikram Aryan, who runs a private clinic on Old Gurgaon Road.Dr Aryan said despite the mounting of cases not everyone can be seen using masks. “Health care professionals need to wear N95 masks, while the general public can wear disposable medical masks or cloth masks,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/despite-being-made-mandatory-wearing-a-mask-not-a-priority-for-many-gurugram-residents/story-6YGi0vkTxDcE8vrklWqE1J.html
30-05-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram records more than 600 new cases in last 30 days; new hot spots emerge||With a surge in the number of positive cases of coronavirus disease (Covid-19), some of the most crowded residential areas in Gurugram are emerging as the new hot spots. As per official data, Covid-19 cases are clustered in areas such as Rajendra Park, Sector 10A, Jyoti Park, Rajeev Nagar, Ravi Nagar, Gandhi Nagar. Each of these areas have at least 10-20 cases, where transmission started with one family member and affected their close contacts. Health officials said that the relaxation in the lockdown is leading to a surge in the numbers. Presently, the Covid-19 tally in Gurugram stands at 677 cases. There are 450 active cases, 224 discharged cases and 3 deaths. Dr Jaswant Singh Punia, chief medical officer(CMO), said, “The spike in the cases started a week after Lockdown 4.0 started on May 17. With the relaxation in the lockdown, people started moving out and are commuting between the city and Delhi. It has led to the emergence of new hot spots in the city.” The Covid-19 situation in Gurugram has seen a major change this week. On May 26, the total cases breached the 300-mark, and in the last three days alone over 340 people have been tested positive. Going by the data, on April 30, the total number of confirmed cases in the city were 68. In the last 30 days, the city has, therefore, seen a spike of 609 coronavirus cases. A major surge has been reported in the last three days. On Thursday, 68 positive cases were reported and on Friday 115. The biggest spike of 157 cases was seen on Saturday, as per the state health bulletin.Data shows Covid-19 clusters have emerged in Sector 10A (20 cases), Rajeev Nagar (18), Sirhaul (30), Khandsa (34), Rajendra Park (13), Chakkarpur (11) and 10 cases each in Ravi Nagar and Jyoti Park. A few cases have been reported in the condominiums of Sushant Lok, DLF-4, New Palam Vihar. In other parts of the city such as Shivaji Park, Basai Enclave, Jawahar Nagar, DLF Phase-2, atleast three to six cases have been reported. According to Punia, more than 85% of the fresh cases are asymptomatic in nature. Punia said, “Out of the 450 active cases, more than 100 positive patients are under home isolation, while those with mild symptoms have been admitted in designated Covid-19 hospital and other private hospitals of the city.” Punia said that in most of the cases, a male member of the family was infected and transmitted the virus to other family members. “We are also seeing that if one person in the family had the onset of mild symptoms and was tested positive, he/she ensured that other family members also got tested. They are also turning out to be asymptomatic but positive, due to which the numbers are rapidly increasing,” he said.The health department is carrying out surveillance in these hot spots by collecting samples proactively, officials said. ”We have collected not only the samples of people with Influenza-like illness but also their close contacts who were suspected cases. Our teams are creating awareness regarding social distancing and wearing masks,” Punia said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-records-more-than-600-new-cases-in-last-30-days-new-hot-spots-emerge/story-srrgDmF4taseGNLqQqizdI.html

The police have invoked stringent sections of the Indian Penal Code against the suspect.The man, identified as Amar Pal Singh , police said was on the run for five days. He was produced in front of a magistrate, who denied him bail and sent him to police custody till Monday, when he will be produced in front of a district judge.“We had registered an FIR, arrested the man and had made a plea against his bail. The magistrate denied the suspect bail on Saturday. A charge sheet had been filed, and the accused had been sent to the jail,” said Sujeet Upadhyay, Station House Officer (SHO), Beta-2 Police station, Greater Noida.The victim, a woman who lives with another Chinese women at ATS Green Paradiso, Greater Noida and works at an electronics company, said that she was relieved to see her assaulter behind bars and hoped that the court does ‘justice’.“I am definitely at ease now. He deserves to be punished as we have come to know that he has misbehaved with other women in the past as well,” said the victim, who sustained multiple injuries, including some on her private parts, after being assaulted.On Monday, the woman was allegedly beaten up by a fellow resident using a heavy wooden stick because she was feeding a stray dog that had a fight with the pet of the accused. A non-cognizable report (NCR) was registered by the police the same day that did not mention the name of the accused, and slapped only section 323 of the Indian Penal Code (voluntary hurt) in the report.Calling out the alleged “inaction” by the police, activists from People for Animal (PFA) met the victim and provided her legal help and demanded strict penal including section 354 (B) (assault of a woman) of IPC.“Finally the man is behind the bars and the victim can feel secure. I thank the commissioner of police and the IO who did a tremendous job. Also we request and hope for speedy action by the police in future when an animal feeder and a woman is attacked,” said Kaveri Rana, president, PFA, Gautam Budh Nagar.“The investigation so far was satisfactory, the bail was rejected by the remand magistrate, and is pending before district judge. We hope that the bail is denied by the district judge as well,” said Vishal Gautam, legal counsel of PFA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/man-who-assaulted-chinese-woman-in-greater-noida-arrested/story-dTg4016bEASAHbNJhSpLuN.html
30-05-2020||Noida||Health department serves notices to six private labs over ‘false’ Covid-19 reports||The Gautam Budh Nagar district health department has issued notices to six private laboratories operating in Delhi-NCR for allegedly declaring eight people of the district ‘falsely’ positive for coronavirus disease (Covid-19).Irked with the alleged false reports, district magistrate Suhas LY said such false positive reports cause panic among the residents. “The chief medical officer (CMO) has been asked to write to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) regarding the authentication and assessment of these six private laboratories. Since the number of sample collection centres has increased in the district, we will certainly keep a close watch on all tests being conducted by the private laboratories,” he said.District surveillance officer Dr Sunil Dohre said at least eight people were falsely tested positive for Covid-19 by the private labs and during the re-examination at government facilities they tested negative. “All eight persons were found negative and were discharged from government hospitals. We have already issued notices to six private pathological laboratories operating in Delhi, Noida and other places, for giving false Covid-19 positive reports to the eight persons. The false reports have caused mental trauma to these persons,” he said.Dr Dohre further said the reports in question that were provided by the six private laboratories were later re-examined and verified by the National Institute of Biologicals (NIB), the Super Speciality Paediatric Hospital, and the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS).“All these reports were later negative at the government facilities. The CMO has also issued strict directives to the private laboratories over their static and mobile sample-collection centres regarding Covid-19 tests. They have been asked to collect the samples strictly as per Covid-19 norms, and the samples must be duly verified by the in-charge of sample collection in the district health department,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/health-department-serves-notices-to-six-private-labs-over-false-covid-19-reports/story-RFOvTz9KDvF3gukLkEIJDK.html
30-05-2020||Noida||Woman duped of ₹9.5 lakh on pretext of upgrading SIM card from 3G to 4G||A 37-year-old woman was allegedly duped of ₹9.5 lakh by unidentified persons on the pretext of upgrading her mobile SIM card from 3G to 4G technology. A case has been registered at the Sector 39 police station in the matter.The victim, Varsha (single name), who is a resident of Sector 108, in her complaint to the police alleged that she was first contacted by the suspects on May 7.“Around 10.30am, I got a call from a person pretending to be from a mobile network company. He said that the company will upgrade my network to better technology, and I agreed to the offer. However, he said that for the new technology to get activated, my phone might lose network for 48-72 hours. In the afternoon, my SIM card stopped working which I assumed was a part of their procedure,” the woman said in the police complaint.However, the SIM card didn’t get reactivated till May 13, after which her family contacted the customer care of the network provider, she said. She was told by the customer care that no such request had been raised on their end.“ Later when I contacted the staff at my bank’s office in Sector 110, I found that almost ₹9.53 lakh had been withdrawn from my account, including two fixed deposits, in two transactions that were carried out on May 8 and 11. I registered a complaint with the bank’s customer care also. The money was withdrawn despite me not sharing any OTP (one-time password) or any other bank details with anyone,” she said in the complaint. She said she suspects that for such a breach, someone from the bank may be involved in duping her.Based on her complaint, a case was registered at the Sector 39 police station against unidentified person(s) under sections 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of the IT Act.“A probe in the matter is underway, while the cyber cell is working on tracing the transactions. Due legal action will be taken,” said a police officer from the Sector 39 police station.A similar incident had taken place on May 7 wherein a resident of Sector 77 had been allegedly duped of ₹1.57 lakh in two transactions on the same pretext of upgrading his SIM card. The suspect had pretended to be from the same network provider, and had even offered the correct customer care helpline details. The victim’s account is also with the same bank but in a different branch. An FIR was registered in the matter at the Sector 49 police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/woman-duped-of-9-5-lakh-on-pretext-of-upgrading-sim-card-from-3g-to-4g/story-DqKEgB2HPRKdvQ8zNg12xK.html

30-05-2020||City||Noida: Despite admin’s directives, RWAs issue their own guidelines on entry of maids||NOIDA: Even as the Gautam Budh Nagar administration has directed that domestic helps and other self-employed persons like electricians and plumbers will not be restricted to enter the residential societies, some residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) in the district have started issuing their own set of instructions.The district administration had on May 16 declared Jalvayu Towers in Sector 47 a containment zone after detection of one Covid-19 case from tower C of the society. But, on May 26, the district magistrate had ordered to lift the ban from the whole society, except the tower from where the positive case was found. Debesh Banerjee, a resident of the society that has eight towers, said that despite administrative orders, the RWA members are not allowing the entry of domestic helps, washerman, car cleaners or even delivery persons of essential items. “The RWA members refuse to abide by the guidelines issued by the DM’s office on May 20, which allowed the entry of maids and other service personnel in residential colonies, except for containment zones. Since only the affected tower is under containment, there should be free movement of goods and services in other towers. But, the RWA here is restricting everything. Now, they say that they will issue their own guidelines.”Echoing similar views, Vimal Dikshit, another resident of Jalvayu Towers, said, “We have tried to expose the RWA members’ authoritarian approach before the administration many times, but all our efforts have proved futile.”Suraj, a washerman who lives near the society building, said that when he reached the society gate wearing face mask on Friday morning, the guards didn’t permit him to go inside. “I was going there as many residents had asked me to collect their clothes for ironing,” he said.When contacted, Manish Shukla, general secretary of Jalvayu Towers RWA, said that the society was under containment from May 16, and the containment, as per a new directive by the DM, was removed from full campus to tower C only on May 27. “After the order from the DM, the RWA has started working on new guidelines for the entry of maids, washermen and drivers into the society. While allowing them, we have to make a comprehensive process for verification of their address and health credentials. We have to prepare ourselves to open the gates to the outside world. We intend to publish our own guidelines by Sunday evening.”Similarly, at Jalvayu Vihar in sectors 21 and 25, the RWA has issued the guidelines that all residents will have to ensure that Aarogya Setu mobile app is downloaded on the mobile phones of their domestic helps. “Please download the Aarogya Setu mobile app on your mobile device if not done already. Please also ensure that the same is downloaded on the mobile phone of your domestic help. It is also available through IVRS for feature phones. It would be advisable to convert your part time maid to full time maid, so as to minimize the movements,” the guidelines stated.When contacted, air vice marshal (retired) Pradeep Kumar, chairman of the Jalvayu Vihar RWA, said that his society does not get any grant from any source and is run on ‘no profit no loss’ basis through receipt of subscription. “If I don’t get the dues from the residents, how will I pay the staff at the gate and in the office to ensure that all precautions are observed. If a resident can claim that services be provided to him by the society, the society also has a right to insist that he clears the outstanding dues, or else the society will stop providing services, including barring the entry of maids,” Kumar said.When contacted, GB Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY said that the societies do not have the power to act as an enforcing agency. “I have asked the different federations of RWAs and apartment owners’ associations (AOAs) in the district to help the administration regulate the movement of maids, drivers, and other helps. If they act as self-styled law-making bodies, stern actions will be taken against them,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-despite-admin-s-directives-rwas-issue-their-own-guidelines-on-entry-of-maids/story-tP0dqC8kxHuwe09daNn3FP.html
30-05-2020||City||Workers from nearby areas start returning to Ghaziabad as industries open||With the commencement of work at nearly 16,000 of the 27,000 industrial units in Ghaziabad, workers from nearby towns and cities, who had gone home after the nationwide lockdown to control the spread of the Covid-19 was announced, has started returning to Ghaziabad to rejoin work. According to officials, the Ghaziabad district has an estimated six lakh workers employed in the industrial and service sectors and about 2.75 lakh are already engaged in production activities in units that have opened.According to the official estimates, about 1.7 lakh migrant workers have left for their home towns till date.“A lot of migrants travelled from states like Delhi, Haryana and Punjab to get buses and trains to their home towns from Ghaziabad. With the opening of 16,000 industrial units in Ghaziabad, about 2.75 lakh workers are back on the floor. Now, we are witnessing a reverse migration of sorts as activities have opened up,” Virendra Kumar, deputy commissioner (industries), said.“During the last 10 days, 900 workers have returned from districts such as Hardoi, Kasganj, Etah, Shahjahanpur, Farukkhabad and Mainpuri, among others. We had sent our roadways buses to bring them back. We are also calling up industrial unit owners to hire roadways buses at government rates in case they wish to bring back their workers from their home towns,” he said.He said there are number of labourers who have come to Ghaziabad from other states during the lockdown and have preferred to stay out in the district.“For these workers who are from Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, etc., we are doing a skill mapping. A first set of 40 such workers were introduced to industrial unit owners and nine of them got offer letters on Saturday. The process to find jobs for the others is on,” Kumar said.The Ghaziabad district has about 27,000 units which include 5,024 small units, 149 related to medium industries and 45 heavy industrial units while the rest are under micro category and also include those in service sectors like saloons, and beauty parlours, among others.According to official estimates, about 40% of the labour force in Ghaziabad preferred to stay back while about 60% have gone to their home towns.“It is an encouraging hat about 2.75 lakh workers are back to work. At present, there is a high demand for labour and workers now have a chance of securing better wages,” Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate, Ghaziabad, said.“So we are assuming that 2.75 lakh workers who are presently on the job in industrial units did not migrate to their home towns and preferred to stay back,” he added.Meanwhile, migrants from Ghaziabad still continues to return to home towns. A train scheduled for West Bengal through Gaya and Dhanbad also left Ghaziabad junction with migrant workers on Saturday.“I work as a domestic help and no one is employing me now. My husband is employed with a company in Noida’s Sector 62 but that is also closed. So we are returning to our village in Malda (West Bengal) by train and will return only after the lockdown is lifted,” Bandana Jha, a domestic help who stays in Kanawani near Indirapuram, said.The first train to Howrah, West Bengal, from Ghaziabad left on Saturday. So far, 32 trains and about 4,700 UP Roadways buses have ferried about 1.7 lakh migrant workers to their home towns from Ghaziabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/workers-from-nearby-areas-start-returning-to-ghaziabad-as-industries-open/story-FZXtD5KfA8vpiOv3kzQrQO.html

It will also construct a six-lane loop so that commuters can easily exit from the expressway to the airport site, officials said. On Friday, the authority issued a tender to hire a contractor for constructing the 760-metre-long road and the loop, said the officials, adding that Yeida has sanctioned Rs 74 crore for the two projects. The development comes 10 days after Zurich Airport International AG, which had won the contract for construction and operation of the Noida International Greenfield Airport project last year, got the security clearance from the Union ministry of home affairs to develop the mega project. “The contractor will be selected in a month, and it will take three months to build this road. We want to build this road well before the Swiss company Zurich International AG begins developmental work on the project,” said Arun Vir Singh, chief executive officer of Yeida and Noida International Airport Limited.The Zurich International was supposed to start the work on the airport project in April, but it got delayed due to the Covid-19 lockdown. The development work at the airport site is expected to start in August, the officials said.“Top officials of Zurich are supposed to travel to Greater Noida to sign an agreement to start work at the site whenever the international flight operations start in India. We hope international air travel will start in June,” said Singh.On May 19, Zurich International had got the security clearance from the central government to develop the Jewar airport project in Greater Noida. The Swiss company had on January 30 this year applied for the security clearance. “All approvals are in place now. The security clearance for the airport project was the most crucial one. So now, it depends on when the lockdown will be lifted. We hope that Zurich will start mobilising workforce at the site in August,” said the Yeida CEO.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/greater-noida-yeida-to-build-road-to-link-jewar-airport-site-with-yamuna-expressway/story-x5onJzqurpVQHTodlzlFZP.html

30-05-2020||City||Ghaziabad asks private hospitals to create Covid-19 wards at their facilities||In order to provide better facilities to Covid-19 patients, the Ghaziabad administration on Saturday asked private hospitals in the district to start a separate wing for such cases in their respective facilities. District officials also asked the private hospitals to come together and dedicate at least one hospital for Covid care. With increasing cases, the district is preparing more Covid-19 beds. Although the Epidemic Diseases Act and the Disaster Management Act are in place due to the pandemic and the government can take over private facilities, the district administration preferred not to do so, the officials said. The district administration has already acquired a private hospital to serve as a tertiary care facility for serious cases.“We met with the management of private hospitals on improving the district’s Covid care capacity. The idea is that no patient admitted to a private hospital should be discharged if he/she tests positive for Covid-19,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate. “In several cases, private hospitals refer Covid-19 patients to government hospitals. But it should not be the case now. For this, hospitals have been asked to declare their hospitals as Covid facilities. They can even pool resources and declare one hospital as a Covid facility. They can also keep a separate ward for such patients. We can make available personal protection equipment (PPE) at half of the price.”According to health department officials, such arrangement has been made as some patients prefer to be treated at private hospitals. There have been instances where patients have complained of lack of facilities at government hospitals and even raised the issue on social media.“Such private hospitals will not be acquired. Once this comes up, the guidelines will be received from the state officials and patients can take up treatment at their own cost. We are awaiting response from the hospitals, after which a list will be sent to the state officials,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer (CMO). “It will also be helpful for the health department. With this, patients will not be sent to outstation hospitals from where they can acquire another infection. We have already acquired a private hospital which is now notified as L-3 (tertiary) Covid facility with 400 beds. We are now trying to prepare 4,000 beds under government Covid care facility. About 2,000 beds have already come up while the proposal for another 2,000 is being sent to the government. The beds are being increased as we expect a surge in Covid-19 cases in the next month.”For the remaining 2,000 Covid beds, the Ghaziabad administration has acquired seven different colleges where the beds will be in form of L1 attached facilities meant for asymptomatic patients.The UP government has already come up with three-layered dedicated Covid-19 hospitals across the state. The Ghaziabad district at present has 166 L1 category beds, 100 L2 category beds and another 400 beds under L3 category meant for critical care.Meanwhile, UP government officials said that 9,091 samples were collected and sent for testing at different laboratories in the state.“We have about 12 automatic RNA extractors which are getting installed at different laboratories in the state. This will help us improve our testing capability. We have 20 two-slot tru-net machines which have been made available and another set of 55 will come in the next three-four days. One machine, which can give test results in little over one hour, will be given to each district,” said Amit Mohan Prasad, UP’s principal secretary (health).“The initial test will give us indication whether a person is positive or negative. Earlier, the second test was to be conducted by using RT-PCR method. Now, the Indian Council of Medical Research has changed protocol and second confirmatory test can be done with the same machine.These machines will help us in cases where patient is in medical emergency,” Prasad added.The machine will also help districts like Ghaziabad which are dependent on other cities like GB Nagar, Meerut or Delhi for testing of samples.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-asks-private-hospitals-to-create-covid-19-wards-at-their-facilities/story-7ewlsyyiXeAh0z8hODiH3J.html

No separate permission/ approval/ e-permit would be required for such movements.”However, the ministry said if a state/union territory proposes to regulate the movement of persons based on reasons of public health and its assessment of the situation, it would need to publicise the restrictions and the related procedures to be followed widely and well in advance.11 NEW COVID-19 CASESMeanwhile, the number of coronavirus cases in Ghaziabad reached 287 as 11 more persons tested positive for the disease on Saturday. According to health department officials, 213 patients have been discharged from different hospitals so far. Four people have succumbed to the disease in the district so far.The 11 new cases that were reported on Saturday include two cases each from Vasundhara and Vaishali localities, while one case each was reported from Akbarpur, Surya Nagar, Khoda, Indirapuram, Kaushambi, Loni and Lohiya Nagar, officials said.The district health department has also lodged a complaint against a Gurugram-based private laboratory for not informing the department o time about a Ghaziabad resident who had tested positive earlier in May.“We have also given a police complaint in connection with an incident wherein the test report of a Covid-19 positive patient was not sent to us for about 13 days in May. The patient despite testing positive did not isolate himself,and the chances of him spreading the infection cannot be ruled out. So we have given a police complaint against a Gurugram-based private laboratory which collected the sample from an unauthorised centre in Vasundhara,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer.According to officials, the samples of the patient were collected on May 6, while his test turned positive on May 7. On May 20, the health department officials came to know about the positive cases through a web portal and sent teams to pick up the patient. He was admitted to ESI Hospital on May 21.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-awaits-directions-from-state-government-over-opening-borders-with-delhi/story-dPI9SWHGRfmXmmJIZfbeaN.html
30-05-2020||Dehradun||Uttarakhand minister Satpal Maharaj quarantined after wife tests Covid-19 positive||Uttarakhand tourism minister Satpal Maharaj was quarantined on Saturday after his wife tested positive for coronavirus disease Covid-19, officials said. Forty others were also quarantined along with the minister.Maharaj’s wife, Amrita Rawat, was tested for the virus on Saturday after she complained of fever for the last few days.Earlier this week the Dehradun administration had put the minister’s private residence under quarantine following the visit of some people from Delhi during lockdown.Confirming the development, the minister said, “My wife had a fever for the last three to four days. First, we conducted an immunity test at a private lab for Covid-19 in which she tested negative.However, when her fever didn’t subside, we got her tested for Covid-19 by taking her swab samples on Saturday in which she tested positive,” he added.The minister said that his family and everyone else who came in contact with his wife will follow the health department protocol and go into quarantine. He added that his wife will be hospitalised for treatment. Ashish Srivastava, district magistrate Dehradun said, “After the minister’s wife tested positive, we found a total of 41 people including the minister who had come in contact with her. All of them will be put in quarantine as per norms.”Srivastava also said that Amrita Rawat had no travel history. “We have made a report on the case and would soon submit it to the government which will decide the future course of action,” the DM said.On Friday, Maharaj had attended the state Cabinet meeting chaired by chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat in which other ministers and officials were present. After Saturday’s development, questions are being raised whether all those in the meeting will also be quarantined, with the Opposition Congress terming it as ‘gross negligence’.Suryakant Dhasmana, vice president of Congress said, “The development just shows how negligent and irresponsible the government is in this fight against the pandemic. Now the question arises whether the entire government be put under quarantine as they were in the Cabinet meeting on Friday.”But Cabinet minister and government spokesperson Madan Kaushik said that no other minister from the meeting will be quarantined as of now. “Minister Maharaj will be tested for the virus and if he tests positive then a decision would be taken on quarantining all the ministers and officials who attended the Cabinet meeting on Friday,” said Kaushik. On May 27, the Dehradun district administration had put up a quarantine notice on Satpal Maharaj’s private residence after it was found that two of his guests had come during the lockdown.However, at that time, the minster had said that the guests were staying in one portion of the house while he lived in another portion with both having separate entrances. The portion quarantined is the one where his guests stayed. Meanwhile, 33 fresh Covid-19 cases were reported in the state on Saturday taking the total tally to 749 . Five people have died of the disease so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/uttarakhand-minister-satpal-maharaj-quarantined-after-wife-tests-covid-19-positive/story-Q7QvfPlBgXMyc8l7WskqpO.html
30-05-2020||City||Noida: More relaxations likely from June 1, night curfew timing to be changed||NOIDA: With the Union ministry of home affairs issuing new guidelines that will come into effect from June 1, the Gautam Budh Nagar administration on Saturday hinted at lifting the border restrictions in the district. However, the district administration made it clear that the Uttar Pradesh government would take the final call on it.According to the Centre’s fresh guidelines that will remain effective till June 30, almost all activities outside containment zones will be allowed to resume in a phased manner. District magistrate Suhas LY said that it has now become an issue of “livelihood versus health”. “The point 6 (i) of the order clearly states that after assessment of the situation, it can be restricted if it causes health issues,” he said. Suhas further said that night curfew would continue to remain in force for all non-essential activities. “However, the revised timings of the curfew will be from 9pm to 5am. It is certainly going to benefit the traders. All activities, which were earlier prohibited, will be opened up in different phases, outside the containment zones. But certain activities outside the containment zones can also be restricted, if needed,” he said.About the containment zones in the district, the DM said that strict perimeter control will be maintained and only essential activities allowed there.When asked about any relaxation in the odd-even formula for shops, the DM said that it will be decided on Sunday after the state guidelines are issued.One more dies of Covid-19 Meanwhile, a 58-year-old man died of Covid-19 in the district on Saturday at the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS), taking the death toll to seven. Incidentally, the deceased was the first patient who succumbed to Covid-19 at an age under 60 years.GIMS director Dr Rakesh Gupta said that the man, a resident of Noida, was admitted in the ICU with bronchopneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome on May 28. “Today, when he was put on high flow oxygen therapy, antibiotics and supportive therapy, and did not show any improvement, we put him on ventilator support. But, he could not survive and died on Saturday afternoon,” he said.On Saturday, the overall tally of Covid-19 cases in the district increased to 405, with the addition of 18 new positive cases. However, three patients, including a three-year-old boy, a five-year-old girl and a 46-year-old man, were discharged from Sharda Hospital. District surveillance officer Dr Sunil Dohre said that of the 18 new cases, there are nine females and as many males. “Till Saturday evening, the number of positive cases reported in the district is 405. Of them, 293 people have been discharged from different hospitals, seven patients have so far lost their lives and 18 have been cross-notified from other districts and states. We now have only 105 active cases,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-more-relaxations-likely-from-june-1-night-curfew-timing-to-be-changed/story-HqZ25be5ICLRkuu4xMZbYO.html
30-05-2020||City||After Khoda and Loni, administration mulling plans to deal with rising cases in Vaishali||Ghaziabad: The prime locality of Vaishali is now under scanner of the district officials after a surge in the number of coronavirus (Covid-19) disease positive cases. According to records of the health department, Vaishali at present has about 30 of the total of 276 coronavirus positive cases reported till Friday night. The district officials said that they are mulling plans if the sector scheme can be implemented for Vaishali.The concept of sector scheme, akin to sealing, is already in place in Khoda and Loni, which have also witnessed the majority of cases in Ghaziabad. Under the sector scheme concept, teams of police, magistrates and health department officials take over an area for strict surveillance, sampling and contact tracing while ensuring restriction on movement of residents.“We are concerned about the number of cases emerging from Vaishali and are holding meetings with police officers and officials of other departments. The sector scheme, in the form of sealing, was put in place in Khoda and Loni and is not likely to be lifted soon till the number of cases comes down. Similar plans can be implemented for Vaishali,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate.According to figures by the health department, most of the cases in Vaishali have surfaced from sectors 1, 3, 4 and 5.“There is already restriction on movement at the bordering areas at UP Gate, Loni and others. The restrictions will continue till further orders,” Pandey added.According to health department officials, most Vaishali residents are those who work in Delhi and regularly have to cross the border.“According to our estimates, there are about 100 cases out of the 276 which are a result of cross border movement and majority of people have acquired it (Covid-19) from Delhi. There are other cases which have resulted from hospitals in Delhi. About 75% of 115 patients tested so far through private labs have tested positive and their source is primarily hospitals,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer.“Since number of cases in Vaishali is on the rise, it is our recommendation for implementation of the sector scheme to check rising cases. In Vaishali, the areas from where cases have emerged were sealed but cases continue to come,” he added.The officials said that Covid-19 positive cases in Khoda, Loni and Vaishali account for about 36% of the total cases in Ghaziabad. Vaishali is home to about 20-25 highrise projects and plotted development areas with an estimated population of about 1.5 lakh.In the meantime, Sahibabad MLA Sunil Sharma has written to the district magistrate and sought relaxation in sealing in Khoda in those places from there are no cases, and seal only those cases from where cases have emerged.“Cases in trans-Hindon areas are on rise and majority of those are due to infections from hospitals or cross-border movement. I have written to the district magistrate to seal only those areas where cases have emerged in Khoda. Otherwise, the rest of the population will suffer. Vaishali and Jhandapur areas are also cause of concern due to rise in cases. Vaishali is affected as majority of the working population goes to Delhi,” Sharma added.Residents, meanwhile, said that the administration must think in larger public interest and take appropriate steps.“Any step taken by the administration must be result oriented. Vaishali shares a border with Delhi and majority of people there travel to Delhi for work. It is also vital that people obey the guidelines of the lockdown and maintain discipline,” said Mohit Sharma, a resident of Sector 1.The sector scheme in Khoda was initiated on May 10 while it was implemented in Loni on May 27. As of now, it has been continued in both areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/after-khoda-and-loni-administration-mulling-plans-to-deal-with-rising-cases-in-vaishali/story-NhTUY9MrJgDlH7QWeU40BO.html
30-05-2020||City||After personal assistant, 13 from Bhiwani MLA’s family, staff test positive for Covid-19||Thirteen persons from BJP MLA Ghanshyam Saraf’s family and staff tested positive for Covid-19 in Bhiwani on Saturday. Two more cases were reported from other parts of the district.This has come a day after the MLA’s personal assistant, who had allegedly flouted social distancing protocol, was detected with the virus.The 13 infected members include Saraf’s 50-year-old wife, daughter, daughter-in-law, son, granddaughter, other relatives and staff members.Claiming that the MLA tested negative, nodal officer Dr Rajesh Kumar said, “The infected persons were hospitalised after their reports confirmed their status on Saturday evening.”BJP MLA FLOUTED PROTOCOLThe BJP MLA along with his PA and other staff members had been organising meetings to felicitate corona warriors for the past few days, while allegedly ignoring Covid-19 protocol.Three days ago, Saraf had organised a meeting in the city and distributed appreciation letters to over 45 police personnel. The former minister had also distributed ration among the needy.“On Monday, Saraf had visited Chandigarh along with his infected aide and three others. After returning home, the MLA’s PA had undertaken Covid-19 test at a civil hospital in Bhiwani. The PA had concealed that his samples were taken and accompanied Saraf to a public meeting,” a staff member of the MLA had said.SPECULATIONS OVER SARAF’S COVID-19 STATUSAfter over a dozen people connected to the BJP MLA tested positive on Saturday, Saraf’s Covid-free status has raised doubts among the medical fraternity.A source in the health department said it was quite strange that the MLA didn’t test positive for Covid-19 even after being in constant proximity of his infected PA, from whom 13 others contracted the disease apparently.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/after-personal-assistant-13-from-bhiwani-mla-s-family-staff-test-positive-for-covid-19/story-FsCr6CqbmkPOh0ubL0Qx2I.html

30-05-2020||Mumbai||Schools cannot sack teachers or hold their salaries: State education department||With reports of several schools sacking teachers or not paying them during the Covid-19 crisis doing the rounds, the state education department has now come up with a circular stating that action would be taken against schools which resort to such practices.“It has come to light that some schools run by private managements are not paying their employees including teachers and non-teaching staff citing school closure as a reason. This is not acceptable as the government has already made it clear that paying its staff is the school’s responsibility,” read the circular.On May 22, HT reported about a school chain in the city asking nearly 150 of its employees to go on leave without pay until further notice. “A lot of schools are now telling teachers that they cannot pay them salaries citing balance payments from parents. Despite the majority of parents paying, teachers are being made to wait for their salaries,” said a teacher from a suburban school which has paid only 30% of the total salary to its staff.Some schools said that they were finding it tough to manage their expenses. “Big chains still have a lot of funds but budget private schools like ours get their funds only from fees. Most of our parents have said that they cannot pay full fees while some have not even paid a single instalment. We cannot pressurise parents and hence our staff is getting only 50% salary,” said the management member of a school in Malad on the condition of anonymity.Schools that do not pay their salaries would have to explain for not doing so and the education department can take action against such schools as per the circular.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/schools-cannot-sack-teachers-or-hold-their-salaries-state-education-department/story-bFZLiSg1aBXxNtFFtXPVkM.html

30-05-2020||City||200th train carrying migrants home departs from Ludhiana||The 200th train, carrying migrants to their home state, departed for Uttar Pradesh (UP) from the Ludhiana railway station here on Saturday.Since May 5, when the first train left from here, more than 3.2 lakh migrants have been sent to their home states through these trains.The train, that left for Madepur in UP, was flagged off by deputy commissioner Pradeep Kumar Agrawal.The administration has been sending around 1,600 migrants in each train and, till date, a total of 203 trains have departed for Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Manipur, Jharkhand and other states.The DC said so far, around 3.2 lakh migrants have been sent safely to their home states. The administration has been informing the registered migrants about their trains via phone calls and SMSes.He said migrants were also given chance of manual registration for one day.The DC said more than eight lakh migrants had registered for travelling to their home states, but as a large number of industrial units have started operations, several of them have dropped the plan to go to their native places and returned to their jobs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/200th-train-carrying-migrants-home-departs-from-ludhiana/story-xMd4V3cfU4TNaz4ZKhhfvN.html
30-05-2020||Kolkata||In Amphan’s trail of destruction, Sunderbans turn red, yellow||Trees in large swathes of the Sunderbans, including several species of mangrove in one of the largest riverine deltas in the world, have started turning yellow and red over the past couple of days, several members of legislative assembly (MLAs) said.The lawmakers have never witnessed this unnatural phenomenon before, even after the cyclone Aila that devastated large parts in and around the Sunderbans in 2009.“All trees are turning yellow and red over the past few days, as an effect of the super cyclone Amphan. The effect is less on mangroves and more on the other trees, such as mango, banyan, jambul, neem, and jackfruit. Leaves of almost all trees on the land are turning yellow or red. They look burnt. We’ve never witnessed such a scene before,” said Samir Kumar Jana, an MLA from Patharpratima, one of the worst super cyclone Amphan-hit areas in the South 24-Parganas district.Among mangroves, it is mainly the Avicennia species that have shown some reddishness on its leaves. “Over the past few days, I’ve been travelling across all interior areas and the situation is the same everywhere. At places, nothing is left green,” said Jana. Kultali MLA Ramshankar Haldar echoed him. Veteran Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader Kanti Ganguly, who represented Raidighi assembly constituency for years, has had a similar experience.West Bengal government authorities said that the Indian part of the Sunderbans consists of 4,200 square kilometres (km) of reserved forests along with 5,400 square km of non-forest area, making a total of 9600 sq. km. Of the reserve forest areas, around 1,500 square km of the forest area has suffered massive damage in the cyclone. The Sunderban delta in India comprises 102 islands of which 54 have human settlements, while the rest are only wild forests.“The effect on mangrove is less, but leaves are turning reddish and yellowish,” said Sukumar Mahato, MLA from Sandeshkhali in North 24-Parganas district.Ravi Kant Sinha, principal chief conservator of forests (PCCF), West Bengal, said that they have received similar reports. “We have heard that trees, including some mangroves, are turning yellow and red. For mangroves, this could be due to damage in their roots, while for other trees it could be due to increased salinity. However, we’ll need time to ascertain whether the damage is long-term or short-term,” Sinha said.According to Himadri Sekhar Debnath, former joint-director of the AJC Bose Indian Botanical Garden, “Even mangroves can turn yellowish due to increased salinity. Mangroves live and grow in a mix of sweet and saline water. If the ratio of pH (the measure of the alkalinity or acidity of the water) and saline water gets disturbed, such effects may happen.”Ajanta Dey of Nature Environment and Wildlife Society, which has conducted large-scale mangrove plantation in the Sunderbans, said the mangroves are least affected. “According to the reports and photographs, all other trees are turning yellowish, like never before. However, we’ve not yet received reports of a similar effect on mangroves. We’ll undertake a field trip soon,” Dey said.State forest minister Rajib Banerjee said a similar report has come to him as well and he would make a visit to the area for a first-hand feel of this unnatural development.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/in-amphan-s-trail-of-destruction-sunderbans-turn-red-yellow/story-oZdtFDfOvP1eKrDtyAUM8O.html
30-05-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh’s third locality to lose containment tag||Shastri Nagar in Manimajra will no longer be a containment zone from Sunday. The decision was taken as the area has not reported any case for 28 days.The last case surfaced on May 2, that of a 49-year-old man. Two other areas — EWS Colony in Sector 38 and parts of Sector 52 — have already been denotified as containment zones. With this, only three containment zones remain: Bapu Dham Colony in Sector 26, Kacchi Colony in Dhanas, and parts of Sector 30B. NO CASE FOR 2 DAYS, RECOVERIES INCH TOWARDS 200Meanwhile, Chandigarh reported no fresh case of Covid-19 for second consecutive day, while 10 more patients recovered and were discharged from the ayurvedic college on Saturday.With this the number of active cases has come down to 85 while the number of recovered patients has reached 199. The recovery rate in the city stands at 68% while the test positivity rate is 6.2%.Out of those discharged, nine are residents of Bapu Dham Colony and one is from Dhanas. They have been sent to the post-discharge quarantine facility at Sood Dharmshala, Sector 22.According to the official media bulletin, the total confirmed cases are 289, though the actual number is 288. The discrepancy is being attributed to the case of a 91-year-old woman from Sector 15 who tested negative in the retest conducted by the PGIMER. To revise the total, the UT administration will have to take the Government of India and ICMR’s permission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-s-third-locality-to-lose-containment-tag/story-zN9WMHP3sdXkXMv6hrYTJN.html
30-05-2020||City||Some friends are never meant to be forgotten||Among all my college friends JD was dearest to me. He was JD to all, even the teachers. Few knew that his name was Janardhan Dutt Sharma. At college, we spent only two years together, sharing just one common class of geography. Outside classes, however, we were together most of the time.We were different in many ways, but these differences never came in the way of our genuine friendship and mutual affection.JD bicycled daily to Government College, Ludhiana from his village Alamgir, which is about 10 miles from the city. I lived by myself in our own house near the college. Often he would come to me first and then we would go to college together. After college he invariably accompanied me to my house, sometimes he stayed with me. We talked, laughed, discussed books and films, shared family problems, made plans for the future and above all gossiped about girls – some real and some dream girls.Our tea sessions at Pandit’s dhaba in the GhumarMandi chowk were lively and enjoyable. The dhaba was strategically located at the southern end of Lovers’ Lane, which led to Gurdev Hostel for girls and Government College for Boys; whereas towards the east quite close by was Government College for women. We patronised the dhaba because of its location and the quality of tea. Pandit died years ago; the dhaba disappeared and in its place came a big departmental store. The place still retains its old name Ghumar Mandi, but it’s a posh shopping area of the city today. And there lie buried sweet memories of my youth and the happy moments spent with friends like JD.Ours was a group of village boys, who were first generation college students. In a way we were yokels and new to city ways. JD was an exception; he had visited Lahore and Shimla (then Simla) and talked about Flattie’s and Devico’s and the attraction of those magical cities. He was my guide in table manners, in handling the knife and fork, in artfully combining colours when dressing, in tying the knot of the tie, in addressing the ladies properly, in selecting good books, in using correct English pronunciation, in watching standard English films and above all in choosing the ‘right’ friends. No wonder he remained ‘Englandi bachha’ to us. Who knew then that one day he would go to England to study, to settle and to die?While doing his master’s (English), JD married a Kenya-born girl of Punjabi origin, who left for Nairobi soon after marriage. JD followed suit leaving his studies incomplete. Subsequently, he emigrated to England with his family. We exchanged letters regularly. Once he did not write to me quite for some time and I sent him a one-sentence letter: “How have you managed to forget your past?” It jolted him, and he wrote a long letter.On a visit to India years ago, he insisted we spend some time together at a hill station, so we went to Mussoorie. We had a wonderful time there. We climbed up to Moti Tibba, went down to see a waterfall, sat on grassy lawns lazing in the sun and reminiscing. It was a perfect holiday for both of us. JD had a knack of making each moment lively and memorable. As the sun was sinking behind the hills and we walked down the Mall, I saw a bright red print displayed in a cloth shop and spontaneously remarked, “how beautiful.” He asked me whom I loved most and when I answered “my eldest daughter,” he went into the shop and bought a shirt-length as a gift for her.JD was a handsome person, fair, tall, with big blue eyes. He had a powerful voice, which he used to good effect while conversing. He was no intellectual but possessed ample practical common sense. He loved the good things of life, enjoyed them and encouraged others to do so. He was not interested in futile discussions on religion, philosophy, communism etc, subjects which interested many students of our generation. He took life as it came and tried to enjoy each moment.When his wife left for Kenya only a few days after their marriage, he wrote to her the lines of a song popular then: Jiwan ke safar mein rahi miltey hain bichhar jaaney ko; aur dey jaatey hain yaadein tanhai mein tarpaney ko (Companions in this life meet us only to be separated, and leave us with memories that torture us when we are lonely.” She felt bad then, but these words proved to be prophetic.They reflect my state of mind, now.JD had been suffering from blood cancer for two years but he did not reveal it to any friend or relative. He passed away on September 3, 1976, in England. I have never forgotten him and can never do so. He visits me in my dreams. In our culture, it is said that if we remember the dead so much and too long, their souls suffer. I do not wish to cause his soul any pain, but I simply cannot forget him. His company was the joy of my youth; his memory is the solace of my old age.Surely, no bond is stronger and more satisfying than sincere friendship.ajhehar@gmail.com (The writer is a retired professor based in Ludhiana)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/some-friends-are-never-meant-to-be-forgotten/story-EJe5hEiIzN9sZMcVYQuEwJ.html

In his complaint submitted with the police on Saturday, Narinder Kumar, a guard in the MC, alleged that he, along with Vikas Kumar, went to the area on Friday afternoon for conducting the survey.“While we were doing our job, Vajinder Kumar, Paramjit Singh, Pinki, Rajveer Singh and around half a dozen more residents stopped us and snatched the survey documents from our hands. They also thrashed Vikas and took us behind a school in the Focal Point area. They confined us to that spot for at least three hours,” alleged Narinder. A video has also gone viral on social networking sites showing Vajinder challenging the police and MLA Sanjay Talwar to take action against encroachers. Area councillor Sandeep Kumari said, “The survey is being done to provide flats to encroachers and develop the land for facilitating residents. But these anti-social elements are becoming a hurdle in the entire process. Vajinder is a close aide of some Shiromani Akal Dal (SAD) leader. Earlier also, residents of the colony had attacked my husband’s vehicle when an MC team reached there to take action against encroachments a few months ago, but the police have failed to take any action against them.” Focal Point station house officer Mohammad Jamil said, “The MC officials submitted their complaint on Saturday evening and police have initiated an inquiry into the matter. No arrest has been made so far.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rajiv-gandhi-colony-residents-land-in-soup-for-stopping-confining-ludhiana-mc-team-holding-survey/story-puokn8KH2Cik0MXYUjETqJ.html

Transporters have suffered huge losses due to the lockdown. While rail and air traffic have been resumed and liquor vends have been opened, we are not allowed to run our vehicles in J&K,” he said and referred to Delhi, Haryana, Uttarakhand and Rajasthan where fares have been hiked by 20 to 30% and the vehicles have started plying while following the SOPs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/transporters-demand-relief-package-resumption-of-commercial-vehicles/story-3UaISgVTn79HkGYL6nxZwJ.html
30-05-2020||City||It’s now or never: Let’s not forget our social responsibilities||To expect our people to show total conformity to the preventive measures against Covid 19, announced by the Indian government is, in fact, to expect a little too much. Some of the mandatory measures such as wearing a mask in public spaces, social distancing, self-isolation or quarantining (in both symptomatic or asymptomatic cases) and getting tested if showing symptoms are some of the important guidelines we are expected to follow. Apart from this, we are also expected to wash our hands frequently; sanitise our living and work spaces, including the surfaces we frequently touch during the course of our activities. Though some people follow these guidelines scrupulously, a majority of Indians don’t think twice before flouting them. We have noticed how social distancing is not always maintained when people are present in public spaces. Something as simple as a mask is often not worn because people say it’s unhealthy or that it’s not going to make much of a difference. There have been other more disturbing violations such as people escaping from hospitals while quarantined or others turning violent when questioned why they were not following the protocol. Initially, when the pandemic had just struck, people also made a deliberate attempt to hide their symptoms or their contact history. Cases of mass congregations, parties or social get-togethers too were reported. This brings us to a pertinent question: How are people expected to conduct themselves in critical times? Are we, as a society, expected to behave responsibly or irresponsibly? Even when things are normal, we Indians, take special delight in flouting norms or the rules, without bothering about our communities and adopting a ‘me first’ approach, not thinking twice about jumping the queue or the red-light or worrying about accidents or inconvenience caused to others. We also have no respect for the law of the land, a fact demonstrated by the Indian police using lathis to force the people stay indoors during the lockdown. It was only the fear of the rod, not concern for others, that kept people from stepping out of their homes. Things got so bad that even the government had to threaten its own defaulting citizens with legal action, that too to help them stay alive and healthy!When people were asked to beat thalis or light candles as a mark of respect for the corona warriors, they hit the roads and started celebrating, disregarding all social distancing rules. They started assembling in groups in their respective residential colonies/flats or apartments as though the crisis was over, and it was time for celebration and victory. This above all, defeated the very purpose for which our Prime Minister had announced this initiative. It is quite evident that a society that doesn’t follow rules and shows scant regard for the principle of collective social responsibility and welfare in the normal times, is bound to flounder in times of a crisis as severe as this.In such crucial times, what we need to understand is that our actions have consequences, not only for us, but also for others. A single mistake in terms of socially irresponsible behaviour won’t only cost us dear, but also take a heavy toll on our fellow citizens, our neighbours, and our community. This kind of lack of social responsibility has, unfortunately, been demonstrated by all sections of our society, illiterate, semi-literate, educated and highly skilled professionals. This is a moment of reckoning for all of us, and we must think of how we cannot only help ourselves but also those around us. After all, fear of law can’t become the governing principle of regulating human behaviour in a society. Ultimately, all civilized societies depend upon the awareness of the individual citizens and also on their ability to conduct themselves in a free, fair and yet responsible manner. How long can the fear be used as a deterrent to prevent dangerous and threatening behaviour in the face of Covid-19 pandemic? It is time, we, the citizens, understood our own role and responsibility in limiting the spread and transmission of Covid-19. The government is doing what it can but when it is such a grave situation, all of us must come together and realize our social responsibility. All it requires is some deep introspection and cultivation of discipline, respect for the law of the land and an ability to feel for and connect with our fellow citizens. And yet, this is too serious to be left to the discretion or whims of the individuals. In order to achieve this social objective, if we have to reboot our education system, it is well worth the effort. We can incorporate the community welfare practices into our education system, right from the primary stage to the university level. This will help our future citizens develop a strong sense of ethics.

The Centre as well as the state BJP leadership during that period indulged in a lot of jangle and rattle with tall claims of addressing all bias against the Jammu region and ending the political hegemony of Kashmir by increasing the Assembly seats of Jammu region. It was however regrettable that the very same leadership had failed to ensure even the commencement delimitation exercise despite lapse of ten months,” said Singh.He said that not only were the controversies being created over the composition of the Delimitation Commission but BJP had started giving feelers of a possible lower share for the Jammu region in the event of Delimitation being held as per census 2011. The BJP in its bid to further appease Kashmir seemed to be planning to give it a higher number of Assembly seats by cleverly conveying to the people that the population of Kashmir region as per the 2011 census was higher than that of Jammu region.And all this gimmickry is being resorted to notwithstanding the fact that the J&K Reorganisation Act of 2019 does not give any weightage to the population in the process of delimiting of Assembly seats.“The population factor which was the major consideration in the erstwhile law on delimitation has been dropped in the Reorganisation Act 2019. And the population factor will matter only in the constituencies to be reserved for SC and ST so as to ensure that only those seats are reserved where the proportion of their population to the total population in largest. With the new criteria weighing heavily in favour of the Jammu region, it was entitled to at least 50 seats in Assembly and a minimum of three seats in the Parliament as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bjp-conspiring-to-allot-larger-share-of-assembly-seats-to-kashmir-harsh-dev/story-TAlaeHD36OcEBr3EI0WJnL.html

30-05-2020||City||Yes, a mother can miss her daughter’s school||The school has been closed for two months now. Though online classes have been a success and my daughter seems to have adjusted to the new system, I miss the familiarity of her school, which brought such positive changes in my life. This makes me travel down memory lane. Back in 2013, when my husband went away to an East African country to take up a new job, my parents made this big move to emigrate to Canada to be with my brother. I was deposited at the altar of the home newly built by my in-laws in Hoshiarpur, Punjab, with a four-year-old daughter in tow, transfer orders to a new station in my hands and a sense of loss gnawing at my heart. Settling in had to be done on multiple fronts, in a new house, a workplace and a new city which though not imposing did seem a little strange to fit in as I didn’t know anyone there, nor did my in-laws who had just moved in after my father-in-law’s retirement from the army.The new order of life dictated being in a marriage sans companionship, long distance phone calls and finding a balance in life while being my own anchor. I admitted my daughter to a school close to our home and would drop her there before going to work and pick her up while coming back. And though the rest of the city was a chaotic blur, the house required personal touches to be called a home and my workplace remained unfamiliar, it was the school which helped me come to grips with the situation I found myself in.It was a place I started identifying with. Many anxious women would queue up with me to wait for their tiny tots who came rushing to them after school. It was somehow reassuring to see other mothers experiencing similar emotions when seeing off their toddlers, a feeling of togetherness foisted upon us as parents of OT (own transport) pupils, spending those few minutes together in the routine of picking and dropping our children while the rest of the students arrived in buses. It started with hesitant smiles and nods and we soon introduced ourselves to each other. My initial resistance to acknowledge this strange kinship, which acted as a bulwark against engaging strangers, soon began to crumble. In the coming days, I would look forward to meeting my ‘friends,’ and they too soon started counting me among their own.For them I was not a newcomer in this city, a stranger seeking acceptance, an unfamiliar face, but another mother, of an OT child. If my daughter found happiness and security in her school then I can say happily that I discovered my first set of friends in the city in these mothers during those difficult years of settling in. Now, after seven years, I still drop my daughter to school, pick her up, meet more or less the same set of women with a few additions and subtractions. For me, this school, which my daughter proudly claims as her own with a glint in her eye, stands for familiarity, love, comfort and acceptance. Now, the city feels less alien, the house is more of a home, and I feel more anchored… Yet gratitude encompasses my heart when I am at the gates of the school. I hope sooner than later this oasis now shut down because of the Covid-19 pandemic will throw its gates open, receiving its flock of students with open arms bringing knowledge, camaraderie, bonhomie to the fore not only amongst the students but their parents as well. ranagill261212@gmail.comThe author is a Hoshiarpur based veterinary officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/yes-a-mother-can-miss-her-daughter-s-school/story-Qz6oOK9G3wlYRyE1hVGInO.html
30-05-2020||Chandigarh||PGIMER has received only 5 donors for plasma therapy clinical trials||With only five donors coming forward so far, the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, is finding it difficult to start clinical trials of convalescent plasma therapy on Covid-19 patients. The trials are aimed at assessing the efficacy of plasma therapy, which uses antibodies found in cured persons to treat infected patients.The criteria laid down by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) states that plasma of only those persons, who had remained critically ill before recovering, can be used. Doctors say that this is posing a challenge as most patients here had remained asymptomatic and thus don’t qualify to be donors.They added that they have even approached survivors in neighbouring states but those patients had also been asymptomatic.Patients admitted in the Nehru Hospital Extension Block will be eligible to receive this therapy. PGIMER’s official spokesperson Dr Ashok Kumar said there is a shortage of donors as a large number of donors have been asymptomatic and thus don’t clear the ICMR criteria.It has been almost three weeks since the institute got the nod from the ICMR for the trials but so far they have not been able to start it.THE EFFICACYThough the efficacy of the therapy is still unknown, Dr RR Sharma, head of the department of transfusion medicine, says, “Some research has shown that the there is direct link between development of antibodies and the development of symptoms. For example: a person who has developed the symptoms like fever and cough has chances of anti-bodies developing in body,” said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pgimer-has-received-only-5-donors-for-plasma-therapy-clinical-trials/story-Bw1Tqkxnk0uWPC42g8rCtJ.html

Similarly, the abrogation of Article 370, which granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir was a historic decision that was necessary for the full integration of Kashmir into India. It also bifurcated the state into two Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir division and Ladakh division, sending a strong message to Pakistan that Delhi was prepared to retaliate in the same capacity, he added.Jai Ram Thakur said that another historic decision taken by the NDA government during one year of its tenure was the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, which seeks to grant citizenship to non-Muslims from three neighbouring Muslim majority countries (Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh) on the ground of religious persecution, prompted intense violent protests.CM said that the coronavirus pandemic has once again proved the political farsightedness and political will of PM Narendra Modi in effectively tackling the crisis. When even most powerful nations of the world were struggling hard to control this pandemic, the situation of India was far better than most of these countries due to the timely decision of lockdown taken by the PM. Steps taken by the Union Government had even been appreciated by the World Health Organization.Jai Ram Thakur said that to bring out the nation from this pandemic the present Union government also announced the largest economic package of 20 lakh crore to revive all the sectors and all sections of the society. He said that ₹1 lakh crore was allocated under MNREGA and about 80 crore people were provided subsidized ration and deposited money in the accounts of 20 crore women under Jandhan Yojana to provide relief to them in the hour of distress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/year-of-conviction-courage-jai-ram-on-first-anniversary-of-modi-2-0/story-Q9zaUfJxYwr1FtQuTD46vN.html

30-05-2020||City||Graft: Shimla court grants bail to suspended health director||A court here on Saturday granted bail to suspended state health services director Ajay Kumar Gupta.He was arrested by the state vigilance and anti-corruption bureau on graft charges on May 20, after an audio clip of him allegedly asking for ₹5 lakh bribe had surfaced online.Special judge Arvind Malhotra granted him conditional bail after hearing the arguments of public prosecutor Sandeep Atri and defence counsel Kashmir Singh Thakur. He directed Gupta to submit surety and personal bonds of ₹2 lakh each, besides prohibiting him from influencing or talking to any witnesses, and cooperating with the investigation agency.Gupta, who is due to retire on Sunday, is accused of seeking bribe against a purchase of healthcare equipment by his department.Gupta was on five-day police custody till May 30 after initially being remanded to five-day judicial custody following his arrest.He was suspended by the state government following his arrest. Earlier seeking his bail, Thakur argued that the investigators were yet to question Prithvi Singh, who is reportedly a liasioning officer of Punjab’s Dera Bassi-based firm Bio Aid and allegedly recorded the audio, in which he can be heard discussing the handover of ₹5 lakh with Gupta.The health scam took a political turn on May 27, when state BJP chief Rajeev Bindal resigned from his post, saying he was doing so to ensure a proper investigation into the case of alleged corruption by the director.In a resignation letter sent to BJP president J P Nadda, Bindal said he was tendering his resignation on high moral grounds as some people were dragging the party’s name in the alleged corruption by the health official.Defence counsel Thakur argued in the court that purchase of any medical equipment was not made at his client Gupta’s instance. The secretary was aware about the purchase and the order was made by the deputy director, he argued.Seeking Gupta’s bail, Thakur stated that his retirement is due on Sunday.Continuing his submissions on the vigilance bureau’s behalf, public prosecutor Atri sought his police custody. The case is serious and if the quality of personal protection equipment (PPE) is compromised, it may endanger the lives of frontline coronavirus warriors, he said.When asked what evidence the prosecution has against the accused, the public prosecutor stated that the audio clip and documents establishing that the payment was made based on his signatures and the work order was issued by him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/graft-shimla-court-grants-bail-to-suspended-health-director/story-Uds9BWXua51EetHV5332SK.html
30-05-2020||City||After Kashmiri Pandits heartwarming wishes on Eid, Muslims reciprocate on Kheer Bhawani||Hindu-Muslim bonhomie has gone viral on social media following Eid greetings of Kashmiri Pandits to Kashmiri Muslims, who reciprocated on Saturday on the occasion of Mela Kheer Bhawani, one of the biggest religious functions of the Kashmiri Pandits.The newfound bonding between the two communities, bound by a shared culture and separated only by religion, is reminiscent of the pre-militancy days in the Kashmir Valley before 1989.“I vividly remember when the situation was peaceful. I live in a lane at Chanapora (in Srinagar), where almost every house belonged to the Pandits and only a few to Muslims. There was so much love and brotherhood in those days. We used to live like a family,” said Javeed Shah, a Srinagar resident, in chaste Kashmiri in an endearing video.The annual Mela Kheer Bhawani is the biggest Hindu festival in Jammu and Kashmir after the Amarnath Yatra. But this year, the celebrations are muted because of the raging coronavirus pandemic. Eid, too, couldn’t be celebrated because of strict compliance of social distancing norms due to the pandemic. Thousands of Kashmiri Pandits from J&K and outside visit every year to pray at the temple of Kheer Bhawani that houses Hindu goddess Ragnya Devi at Tulmulla village in Ganderbal, about 27km away from Srinagar.“Mubarak to you on the big occasion of Tulmulla (the place where Kheer Bhawani temple is located). May you always smile and be happy,” greets Dr. Ommid in a video.Many Pandits were overwhelmed by the gesture.“Thanks for wonderful gesture. May Mata Rani blesses all of us with good health, prosperity, and peace,” says Roop Krishan Raina in a social media post.The video was uploaded by Amit Wanchoo, a doctor and social activist, who had earlier uploaded a video of Kashmiri Pandits greeting Kashmiri Muslims with Eid Mubarak.Another video wishing the Kashmir Pandits Mubarak on Mela Kheer Bhawani was shared by The Mashq Talks on social media.Local Kashmiri Muslims took care of the Kheer Bhawani shrine after the exodus of a majority of Kashmiri Pandits from the Valley during the first wave of militancy in 1990.The temple has attracted more devotees since 2008, as the militancy waned.There was no congregation at the temple this year, Farooq Ahmad, tehsildar, Tullmulla, said.“A few devotees have been praying since Friday evening as per the custom, which will end on Saturday evening. No mela could be held this year because of the pandemic,” he said.“One of the best things about religions is festivals and the best thing about festivals is culture. Sadly, the Kheer Bhawani festival couldn’t happen this year. Jyestha Ashthami Greetings,” said Shahid Choudhary, deputy commissioner, Srinagar, in a social media post.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/after-kashmiri-pandits-heartwarming-wishes-on-eid-muslims-reciprocate-on-kheer-bhawani/story-H8YltgIR8SFxhRaE9lmaXO.html
30-05-2020||Chandigarh||Panjab University puts annual fee hike on hold||The Panjab University syndicate on Saturday decided to indefinitely defer 7.5% fee hike for self-financed courses and 5% for traditional courses for new entrants in the 2020-21 academic session.The fee hike was proposed by a 15-member PU panel set up by the vice-chancellor in a February 20 meeting. The members of the syndicate made the decision considering the Covid-19 lockdown.“The fee hike item was withdrawn and no discussion took place on it. It has been deferred indefinitely owing to the economic situation created by the lockdown,” said a syndicate member, requesting anonymity.Sources said the fee hike for new entrants is unlikely to get the nod later in the year too.Opposition from studentsBefore the meeting, various student organisations protested against the proposed fee hike. Members of the National Students Union of India (NSUI), Students For Society (SFS), Ambedkar Students Association (ASA) and Students Federation of India (SFI) among others handed over representations to syndicate members opposing the hike.Panjab University Campus Students Council (PUCSC) president Chetan Chaudhary, who had also opposed the move in the February meeting, said, “The syndicate has taken the decision in the interest of students.”Additional finances to be affectedIt will be for the first time in many years that PU might not implement the annual fee hike.The annual hike allows the fund-starved varsity shore up finances.PU finance and development officer Vikram Nayyar said: “If the fee hike is not implemented, it will affect the additional funds that were expected from it.”It is learnt the university was expecting additional funds of around Rs 80-90 lakh from the hike.Other decisionsMeanwhile, the syndicate decided to form a committee to review the proposals for introducing several new courses from the next academic session.The tentative academic calendar for the 2020-21 session was also approved. However, the vice-chancellor has been authorised to make changes to it, if needed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/panjab-university-puts-annual-fee-hike-on-hold/story-zLWxThomQyIO8DXU9fxpxK.html

30-05-2020||City||Haryana’s crop diversification drive catching farmers’ eye||The Haryana government’s financial incentive-linked diversification drive to encourage farmers to switch over to alternate crops in place of water guzzler paddy has started gaining the toehold.About three weeks after the ‘Mera Pani- Meri Virasat’ policy was launched, followed by protests of the opposition Congress, other parties and a section of farmers, over 26,000 farmers have opted for the scheme till May 30.The agricultural land these farmers have so far registered for sowing crops such as maize (5,254 hectare), bajra (3,870 hectare), cotton (19,247 hectare) and starting horticulture in place of paddy is over 30,557 hectare, as per sources in the agriculture department. There is no deadline for registration on the portal. The farmers switching over to alternate crop in place of paddy will be paid ₹7,000 per acre incentive as the objective of this policy is to encourage farmers to cultivate alternate crops in the area that was under paddy cultivation last year.As per the data, farmers from across the state have been registering themselves on the ‘Mera Pani- Meri Virasat’ portal, mentioning the area of the land and alternate crops they wish to grow.The state government has promised these farmers that it will procure maize and cotton under the minimum support price (MSP). “The objective of the policy is to encourage farmers to voluntarily opt for crop diversification and become eligible for ₹7,000 per acre financial incentive,” a top government functionary said.Eight paddy-rich blocks, including Ratia (Fatehabad), Siwan and Guhla (Kaithal), Pipli, Shahabad, Babain and Ismailabad (Kurukshetra) and Sirsa block of Sirsa district, where the depth of ground water level exceeds 40 meters, have been primarily included in this scheme.The policy “advises” farmers of these eight blocks to diversify more than 50% land that was under paddy cultivation last year to become eligible for the financial incentive. There are 12 other blocks with water depth of more than 35 metres and the panchayats of these blocks own the agricultural land. The government will not give permission for paddy cultivation in such blocks to the panchayats. However, ₹7,500 per acre incentive amount will be given to the concerned panchayat.As per official records, six gram panchayats had submitted a petition in the Punjab and Haryana high court challenging this policy. A two-judge bench of the high court, however, dismissed the gram panchayats case on May 28.While marginal farmers having three acre land are eligible for ₹7,000 incentive by diversifying one acre land, the policy “advises” farmers using 50 HP electric motor to operate tubewells against paddy cultivation.The crop diversification drive of the BJP-JJP coalition government comes ahead of paddy transplantation, which begins on June 15. Haryana produces near 68 lakh metric tonne (LMT) paddy, including over 25 LMT basmati. The land under paddy transplantation across the state is about 32 lakh acre.The cultivation of paddy has contributed to degradation of natural resource such as water and soil. Also, the ground water table of Haryana has been declining steadily.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/haryana-s-crop-diversification-drive-catching-farmers-eye/story-GcBgy4MywdKoVeql9Si2wJ.html

But, for the past few months, they said, they had been facing a lot of trouble and the authorities have failed to pay any heed to the problem.A resident, Rakesh Kumar, said, “Several complaints have been made to the authorities and councillor Sonia Sharma in the past, but no one is paying heed to the problem while we are continuing facing an acute shortage of water. The authorities are asking us to maintain hand hygiene, but water is not being provided in the area even for drinking.”SAD leader Sandeep Shukla said, “A few property dealers have constructed illegal colonies in the New Sundar Nagar area and now, neither the colonisers nor the MC, is providing facilities to residents. The residents are forced to bring water from nearby areas or from the houses where submersible pumps have been installed. Besides lodging several complaints, we also contacted mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu on Saturday, who assured to look into the problem.”BJP councillor Sonia Sharma said, “Residents are facing shortage of water due to the construction of illegal colonies in the area and the supply of water is less than demand. I had raised the issue in the meeting of the MC General House also, but no action was taken against such colonies. The MC should take action against illegal colonies and their connections should be snapped.”Sandhu said, “I have asked the officials to find a solution to the problem and soon water supply would be resumed in the area. Officials have also been told to send water tanks in the area for supplying potable water.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/residents-facing-shortage-of-water-try-to-install-private-tubewell-in-ludhiana-officials-confiscate-equipment/story-HUm8SrhRSV2UQOy9DkjVYL.html

30-05-2020||Mumbai||Illegal telephone exchange used to call J&K defence personnel busted, 1 arrested||The crime branch of Mumbai Police busted an illegal telephone exchange racket operating from Govandi and arrested one person on Saturday. Agencies are probing if a terror or spy network was operating using multiple SIM boxes as several calls were made to defence establishments in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K).A SIM box routes international calls as local calls, allowing the box’s operator to bypass international rates charged by local mobile network operators. The SIM boxes are fitted with hundreds of GSM SIM cards procured using fake IDs.“Two mobile numbers used to make calls were traced to Govandi. These two numbers were kept under surveillance. All the calls received by the parallel exchange were made from abroad. We have started an investigation based on the seizures,” said Akbar Pathan, deputy commissioner of police (detection 1). Sources stated that the calls were made to seek information on defence establishments. Police seized a total of five SIM boxes, of which one was inactive, and have also recovered 223 SIM cards, 10 mobile phones, a laptop modem, connection board and batteries in the raid conducted at a room of a building in Natwar Parekh compound in Govandi.Police have arrested Sameer Alwari, 38, in connection with the raid. The accused was living with his family in the room in Govandi. He was previously arrested in Thane in 2017 for similar crimes. After scrutinising the number and its call records, the crime branch found that Alwari made and received several calls from other countries. The accused would illegally convert voice-over-internet telephony (VoIP) calls from abroad into a local call through the illegal international gateway.In a statement issued by Mumbai Police, the crime branch said that it received a tip-off about a parallel exchange suspected to be used for anti-national activities by unfriendly nations. “As such calls are not regulated, they can be used for anti-national activities,” read the statement. Such rackets also lead to a loss to the national exchequer and service providers. Investigations revealed that two numbers of the same service provider registered in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh were used to divert calls. In February this year, the crime branch has busted a similar racket operating from Noida in Uttar Pradesh and Changaramkulam in Kerala. Police seized a total of eight SIM boxes and recovered 686 SIM cards from the raids in the two cities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/illegal-telephone-exchange-used-to-call-j-k-defence-personnel-busted-1-arrested/story-C4yrryCUYfWZfFpEGV4CXJ.html

Now, most of them have gone back to their homes. Currently, most industries in Yamunanagar are working with 15% to 20% workforce. We cannot hire local labour due to finance and skill factors,” he said.“Also, the supply line of our finished products is still bleak as most buyers are from Maharashtra, Gujarat and Delhi, which are most affected due to coronavirus. At present, the demand is only from small buyers in Haryana, Punjab or Rajasthan,” Bhiani said.“The Haryana government is also yet to take the cue of our earlier demands on refund of license fees deposited with them. It can act as an economic booster for us,” he added.The All India Plywood Manufacturing Association under president Devendra Chawla had raised the issue of refund, after a meeting with officials of the state government last month. Cabinet minister Kanwar Pal, who is an MLA from Jagadhari constituency, had said, “The state government had decided to do away with charging this fee and refund the amount to industrialists. The matter is under process.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/plywood-industries-in-yamunanagar-bear-the-brunt-of-lockdown/story-yo0wcyduCNERkcZ7tt1c9H.html
30-05-2020||India||Now paying: Covid-19 protection fee for salon services?||Gurugrammers couldn’t be happier when salons got a green signal in the millennium city. But, now there has come a shocker for those visiting the salons. Shikha Sheth, a Gurugram-based corporate, recently posted on social media about her experience at a salon where she went to avail the much-awaited hair and beauty care, and in return was handed over a bill that charged her a ‘Covid Protection Fee’; this charge was beyond the cost of services she had availed at the salon.Sharing the incident on Facebook, Sheth wrote: “I asked for the bill to be seen as I thought it seemed bloated. When I looked at the line items, there was a charge of INR 240 for Covid protection - I asked what this is and I was told that its all the covid gear that they are using (sic).”Read More: Stylists in PPE kit, service by appointment: Parlours, salons open amid Covid-19 pandemicWhen contacted, Sheth, who works with a global executive search firm, says the problem was “non-disclosure”, and adds, “I asked them to show me the bill and the guy at the counter hesitated. He wasn’t giving a print out and said ‘You come here and see on the screen’. I saw the ‘Covid Protection Fee’ and I pointed out ‘What is this?’ To which he said ‘All the kits and stuff like that’... I remember when I had entered the salon, they were not wearing shoe covers, there was a sanitiser but no face shields. PPE kits that they claim they’re supposed to be wearing were like an apron. When I’m paying a bill of ₹1,700, and in addition giving a tip of ₹100, why would I have a problem paying another ₹247? My problem is, why didn’t they didn’t tell me at the time of booking of the appointment. If it’s a new addition, the necessity to pay this service charge is neither displayed at the reception nor at the entry door. The lady (at the front desk) said ‘If you’re not going to pay, we’ll inflate your bill by 10%’. To me, this is a clear case of duping the customers.” Read More: Gyms, salon owners seek govt nod to open shops from June 1When contacted, director of the salon in question, Manisha Yadav, told us that she’s investigating the matter, but also emphasised that their expenses have shot through the roof. “This is the charge we are taking for the disposables we are using. We have been open for many days and nobody has really said anything, but maybe she was not told prior. Otherwise, we don’t take the customer only. There is an extra charge because we are using additional things [like] extra set of disposables. The moment you walk in the salon, you are given shoe cover, and even the fabric is sanitised. We are not cutting corners, but saying that protection is the most important thing not just for my customers, but even for my staff. We are not going to take any chance as health is most important. People are not realising that more than them, my staff is at risk! We don’t earn that much money, and the amount of money that is spent on disposables right now [is quite something] because the customers walking in, are very less,” says Yadav, adding, “We have taken this feedback. There’s a talk going on with all salon owners. We will try and see the best possible way, so that nobody feels the pinch.”Unlike Sheth, other denizens feel such a charge is completely uncalled for! Smriti Chhabra, who is the founder of a community of Gurugrammers, says, “Some doctors are also charging extra for PPE gear, which they are asking the patients to wear during check up. We understand that it’s an additional cost for salons, to add to their consumables to run their operations. But why are the customers being charged for it? And if they are charging it, then there should be a capping on the amount as it shouldn’t pinch the customers visiting them.” Some of the salon owners/management also question this new charge that has become the bone of contention in the current scenario considering some disposables were part of the services earlier as well. “I’m not sure in what capacity is this being charged” says, Sonali Bhambri, director, Toni & Guy (North India), adding, “In our gear, disposable sheets, strips and face napkins, were already there. In hair, we have shifted from regular towels to disposable towels, which is an added cost, but as of now we are not charging extra for that bit.” Divya Parchani, marketing manager - India, Geetanjali Salon, informs that they have made a Covid-19 test mandatory for their employees, and alongside provided PPE kits and introduced disposable towels etc. “If I sell a particular service for ₹400, it accounts for the employee fee, different expenses plus a profit margin. Now, the expense per service has gone up. It’s subjective for every brand if they are unable to pay it from their pocket, and totally depends on what is the profit margin that the brand has. Presently, we are not charging any such fee, and as a brand we feel we shouldn’t be charging such a fee right now,” says Parchani.Some who frequent salons say that they don’t mind paying extra, but demand prior clarity. “You can increase the price of the services your giving by 10-15%, but a mandatory Covid-19 charge is unacceptable,” opines Aparna Tandon, a Delhi-based entrepreneur, whereas Gurugram resident Nidhi Wahi Gaura, adds, “Whatever addition is made in the billing, it must be informed to the customer prior to being served. If the customer agrees to pay it, only then should the salon proceed with the service.”Author tweets @nainaarora8Follow @htlifeandstyle for more||https://www.hindustantimes.com/coronavirus-crisis/now-paying-covid-19-protection-fee-for-salon-services/story-SyVIfCG5X4X2sny4eYpmZO.html
30-05-2020||City||Lioness delivers three cubs at Pipli zoo, one dies||An Asiatic lioness has delivered three male cubs at the Pipli Zoo in Kurukshetra, as per state wildlife authorities.However, the officials said, one of the cubs died within 48 hours of delivery.Director of Pipli Zoo, Tejbir Singh, said the lioness Sakshi gave birth to three male cubs on May 17 and one of them died soon after. He said a team of veterinary doctors is taking case of the cubs and the lioness, who have been kept under CCTV surveillance to ensure survival. They have been separated from their father Geet, he added. The pair of Gir lions—Sakshi,8, and Geet,10,—were brought to the Pipli zoo from Junagadh in Gujarat in December 2015. The zoo has remained closed for public since March following the Covid-19 lockdown. Singh said the lioness Sakshi is lactating the cubs which is good for their immunity. Veterinary expert, Dr Ashok Khasa, who is taking care of the cubs, said, “They are under watch through CCTV cameras but we believe that this time the chances of their survival are very strong as Sakshi was taking good care of the cubs and has developed motherly hormones.”According to wildlife experts, unlike tigers, lions live in large groups in natural conditions such as forests and lionesses collectively take care of cubs. However, since it was Sakshi’s fourth consecutive delivery and second in the past two years, experts expected that she would take care of them naturally. In August, 2018, Sakshi had delivered five cubs of which two had died. The three cubs were named as Arjun, Geeta and Sudha. Arjun and Geeta got their names from Mahabharta since they were born in Kurukshetra. Sudha was named after Thanesar MLA Subhash Sudha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lioness-delivers-three-cubs-at-pipli-zoo-one-dies/story-4PoD3fitMjYPlu1rqLDLzO.html

The government is peddling false hope to the public, ” Sharma said.“With around 1, 74,000 cases and around 4,900 deaths in the country, it is inconceivable that there is no community spread,” he said, adding that it was better to plan for the worst and hope for the best.The Congress leader asked if the Union government had a blueprint ready for tackling Covid-19 once the lockdown ends.He said as per experts, both from India and abroad, the number of cases were rapidly increasing and could be expected to peak in July, which means that the curve was likely to extend till September.“And there is the possibility of a second wave in the winter,” he said.“As per these experts, at some point in early July (if not earlier) our health infrastructure will completely breakdown, which in simple terms mean hospitals in many places and cities will run out of beds to treat Covid-19 patients,” Sharma said.Sharma said the four lockdowns, which lasted 69 days, failed to combat the onslaught of the deadly virus.He warned that no vaccines will be available till early next year:“If we are not prepared, we may lose this battle against the virus,” he said.EXTEND MGNREGA TO HARVESTING He demanded that MGNREGA be extended harvesting and other agricultural activities.This will serve dual purpose—those who are out of jobs will get work and the farmers who are struggling to find labour for harvesting will get help.“The Union government should work on a national program that provides ration to every citizen with or without a ration card, for at least six months, which is easily achievable given our ample stock of food grains,” Sharma said. The Centre should prioritise activities that will allow the economy to recover. Allow freedom of movement for work including public transport but ban mass religious, social and cultural gatherings for the next few months, he said.“We know that the virus spreads with or without a lockdown. But we cannot fight the Covid-19 virus on an empty stomach,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/cong-leader-sudhir-sharma-accuses-centre-of-hiding-the-extent-of-covid-19-spread/story-RwFj9kDK9EPVBzXOpwwVFL.html

In a letter to the Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar, the chief minister pointed out that a central agriculture university had been established in Imphal, Manipur, in 1993 with constituent colleges in six states of the north-eastern Himalayan region. He added that in 2014, the Union government planned to open one more central agriculture university at Pusa, Bihar.The CM said the north-western Himalayan region of the country with a population of 3.1 crore and area of 3,31,953 square kilometres comprising the Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh and the states of Himachal Pradesh and Uttrakhand should have a central agricultural university. HP BRIMMING WITH BIODIVERSITY: THAKUR He said the region was rich in biodiversity and natural resources such as minerals, water and forests was suited for cultivation of different crops.Thakur said Himachal Pradesh was a key state in the region and major river basins such as Sutlej, Ravi, Beas, Chenab and Yamuna fall in the state. He said that the state offered tremendous potential in agriculture and allied sectors, and the existence of an institute of higher learning and research in the form of a central agriculture university will go a long way in bringing much needed prosperity to the people living in the north-western Himalayan region.WELL-CONNECTED VARSITY The CM said CSKHPKV was centrally located and well connected by air, road and rail. “The university has adequate existing infrastructure and a sprawling campus covering around 615 hectares with constituent colleges of agriculture, veterinary and animal sciences, community science and basic sciences, including a network of 12 regional research stations, sub- stations and eight Krishi Vistar Kendras on 233 hectares of land in different agro-climatic zones of the state.Thakur said if the Union government accepts the request of the state government it will be mutually beneficial as with minimum resources and investment, the Central Agriculture University could become a strong farm university and an international leader. He said the Union government will get the existing infrastructure and human resources and the state will benefit from having a central agriculture university.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/himachal-seeks-central-university-status-for-agricultural-university/story-D3cNAn9EmyzIis5mynKKFK.html

It has challenged the BMC commissioner’s May 22 notification, prohibiting the over-the-counter sale of liquor in the city and allowing home delivery through online sale.It was argued on behalf of the association that in other Covid-19 hotspots like cities of Pune and Nashik, where identical situation existed as regards the coronavirus pandemic, normal retail sale of liquor was being permitted and there was no reason why the same norms should not be applied in Mumbai.The association’s counsel submitted that the system of an online sale or home delivery was fraught with difficulties and apart from being unsafe can have an adverse social impact, and urged the court to strike down the notification and issue necessary directions to the BMC to allow over-the-counter sale of liquor in Mumbai.The bench of justice Nitin Jamdar and justice NR Borkar, however, refused to interfere with the civic chief’s decision.The bench said the order does not permit over the counter sale of liquor and permits e-commerce platform to be utilised for delivery.“This decision is in the nature of the policy. Such a decision entails evaluation of various competing factors,” said the bench.It, however, placed the plea for over-the-counter sale before the municipal commissioner and directed the civic chief to take an appropriate decision on it. “The situation may differ from place to place. The relevant factors can also undergo a change by passage of time,” the bench said in this regard.The bench granted four weeks to the state government to reply to the association’s prayer for a refund of licence fee—proportionate to the loss caused due to the closure of liquor shops due to the nationwide lockdown in the wake of coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-refuses-to-direct-bmc-for-over-the-counter-sale-of-liquor-in-mumbai/story-ThHys5EJlkZlhxWiHTPfWN.html

This is the biggest number of coronavirus cases to have been recorded in a single day. Gurugram’s Covid-19 count stands at 520, as per the state health bulletin. It is the highest in Haryana so far.Of the total cases, there are 293 active patients, while 224 have been discharged after the recovery from the highly contagious disease. On Friday, 31 patients were discharged. The death toll stands at 3, as per the health bulletin.The district health team, however, did not share the details of the fresh cases and the areas from where they have been reported.The city saw a massive surge in Covid-19 cases in May as compared to April. On May 1, the total number of coronavirus positive patients was 71. In a month’s time, 449 new cases have been reported. On Thursday, the city recorded the second-highest spike of 68 cases. The positive cases were reported from more than 30 areas.A member of the rapid response team said, “The 115 cases are from different parts of the Gurugram block. It includes areas such as DLF-4, Rajeev Nagar, Surat Nagar, Nathupur, Sector 10A, Sector 18 and Hari Nagar, Gandhi Nagar, among others.” He said that the reported cases are all fresh ones and not holdover cases, refuting to all the rumours that the sudden spurt in the number is due to addition of cases that have been in the backlog.Official data till May 28 showed that some of the worst-affected areas are Dundahera (19 cases), Rajendra Park (12), Khandsa (32), Sector 10A (19), Rajeev Nagar (10), Ravi Nagar (10), Jyoti Park (9), Chakkarpur (7), Gandhi Nagar (6) among others.

30-05-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: The evening portrait of a ‘labour’||With his dhoti, turban, and weather-beaten slip-on shoes, he looks like a farmer walking through his village field, far away in the heart of Indian countryside.But Kashi Ram is walking down the road that goes past Nehru Place in south Delhi.Stopping on request for a brief chat, he stands right on the middle of the road. There is no danger of being hit by a speeding car. Despite an ease in the coronavirus-triggered lockdown, the stretch is free of traffic, at least at this hour, in this hot muggy evening.“I have started to work again,” says Mr Ram. The man has a slim physique; his limbs are sturdy, his skin is tight. He might be in his 50s, but there is no way of confirming it; he has no idea of his age. “I have no I-card,” he says, looking amused—at least that’s the hint one gets from eyes that seem to be smiling. The rest of his face is hidden behind the folds of his turban.“Karuna,” he utters, as if responding to a query. He lifts a finger towards the sky, shaking his head. He is referring to corona, probably to explain his elaborate face wear.Mr Ram calls himself a “labour”. He says he started going to work (after a long gap due to lockdown) five days ago. He is part of a “labour gang” hired by a contractor in the construction of a house that is coming up in Kalkaji.“I’m heading home now,” he says, his voice so low that he could as well be whispering. It’s anyway difficult to understand him. Mr Ram is speaking Hindi very fast and in a dialect (or is it an accent?) that is difficult to comprehend. Resuming his walk as if impatient to reach his destination, he informs he is from a village in Jhansi, UP. He quickly garbles out a series of sentences, explaining that his colleagues left for their villages during the lockdown. He too tried to go back but couldn’t. “Not enough money.”Suddenly, Mr Ram pauses, stands like a statue and allows himself to be photographed. His frayed kurta is very evocative of his life. It is stitched up at various places. “It has gotten old.... it gets torn... I sew it.... it again gets torn, I sew it again.”Gesturing towards the bag he is holding, he says it has his lunch box. “I cook myself.” He finally reveals he lives near the Moolchand Metro station. On being asked if he stays alone or with family, he gives an indirect answer: “I’m trying to return to Jhansi, if only there could be a cheaper way.... things aren’t good.”He leaves it unsaid if things aren’t good in his home town or with him in Delhi.“No zameen (land) for kheti (farming) at home,” he mutters. There is also no water to irrigate, he adds. His eyes are no longer stretched to their extremes, suggesting that maybe he has stopped smiling.Soon afterwards he walks away with a slow pace down the same road, which is still empty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-the-evening-portrait-of-a-labour/story-p47pYP9bUITmMa865VxFrJ.html
30-05-2020||Delhi||4.5-magnitude earthquake felt in NCR||A magnitude 4.5 earthquake hit Haryana’s Rohtak, over 65 km from Delhi, on Friday evening at 9.08 pm with its epicentre at a depth of 5 km, the National Centre for Seismology (NCS) said. This is the latest in a series of temblors that have hit Delhi and the adjoining areas since April. A mild 2.7 magnitude earthquake hit Delhi for the second time in two days on April 13. The tremor had its epicentre at the depth of 5 km in northeast Delhi’s Sonia Vihar. A 3.5 magnitude earthquake a day earlier had its epicentre at the same location at the depth of 8 km. Another temblor of 3.4 magnitude hit Delhi on May 10.People across Delhi and particularly those living in high rises felt the fresh tremors, NCS said. “We got calls even from people, who live on grounds floors and still felt strong tremors. This [fresh] earthquake [has its epicentre] in ...Rohtak in Haryana. We have recorded five earthquakes in Sonia Vihar since April; three of them were very mild,” said an NCS official.AP Pandey, an NCS seismologist, said the region near Rohtak has been very active due to convergence of some fault lines. “There is the Delhi-Haridwar ridge, Delhi-Sargodha ridge and Mahendergarh-Dehradun fault. It like a junction of these faults. In 2012, we had recorded a 5.1 magnitude earthquake just west of that location. We can expect some aftershocks to follow after the mainshock,” he said.When Delhi recorded the 3.5 magnitude earthquake in April, seismologists said it is not unusual for the epicentre of these relatively small earthquakes to be in Delhi and Haryana. But less noise from traffic made the recording on seismometer very accurate. NCS seismologists said they had a “very good” recording. “The recording was very clear because of no noise. This time the magnitude of the earthquake is also higher. So people must have felt it. It is a lot of energy being released. If one is at home, the experience can be more intense but not so much if they are moving.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/4-5-magnitude-earthquake-felt-in-ncr/story-7fAQcmG2mNdV4ozAT5FUbM.html
30-05-2020||City||Over 300 labourers left homeless as fire destroys shanties in Ludhiana village||It was a close shave for around 50 migrant labourers as a fire broke out in over 50 closely packed shanties in Rawat village on Rahon road on Friday. Though no casualty was reported, over 300 migrant labourers, including women and children, have been rendered homeless. Over a dozen goats have died in the incident, labourers said.Besides, furniture, electronic devices and other valuables, including some cash they had saved for emergencies, were also destroyed in the fire.Though the cause of the fire has not been ascertained, some claimed that the incident took place while a labourer was cooking food in one of the shanties, while a few others said that there was short-circuit due to the electricity cables hanging overhead.As per information, the fire broke out around 9am and due to the strong winds, it spread quickly. Four gas cylinders kept in the shanties are also said to have exploded.Govind Kumar said, “I was working in the farms when I came to know about the incident. I rushed back and saw that everything had been gutted. Everyone around was screaming and crying over their loss. It is already so difficult to find work due to the coronavirus spread, and now we lost the roof over our head too.” Most of the residents here hail from Bihar and have been living in this village for over three decades years. They have now been shifted to the village gurdwara, where food is being provided by police and villagers.RESIDENTS CLAIM DELAY IN FIRE FIGHTING OPSA few labourers claimed that there was a delay in the arrival of the fire brigade, however, the fire fighters claimed they reached the spot 10 minutes after receiving the alert. Ravi Kumar, a fire fighter, said it took over three hours for the fire brigade to control the blaze. Meharban station house officer (SHO) Kulwant Singh Malhi said soon after getting the information, he went to the spot and shifted the labourers to the local gurdwara. “It is suspected that fire broke out while a labourer was cooking food. Police commissioner Rakesh Agrawal has been apprised of the whole situation,” said Malhi.TWO OTHER FIRE MISHAPSMeanwhile, a two-year-old girl suffered burns in a fire at a labour quarter in Phase 7 of Focal Point Area. Assistant sub-inspector (ASI) Bhupinder Singh deputed at Jeevan Nagar police post said, “The fire broke out in the room after a burning candle fell off a shelf when the family was sleeping on Thursday night. The child has been shifted to Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, and her condition is stable. Other family members are safe and fire was controlled with the help of fire brigade.”Another fire incident was reported from a shawl manufacturing unit in Geeta Colony on Tajpur road on Thursday night. The incident took place around 9.30pm. As the factory was closed at the time, no casualty was reported, however, the owner said, he lost goods worth lakhs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/over-300-labourers-left-homeless-as-fire-destroys-shanties-in-ludhiana-village/story-bwf40HzngP5fgY493whuYN.html

30-05-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC House meet: ₹66 lakh booking amount for community centres to be refunded||The municipal corporation (MC) will be refunding about ₹65.98 lakh to people who booked various community centres in the city between March 22 and May 31, members decided at the first General House meeting held here via video conferencing after two months of curfew and lockdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic.Other decisions at the meeting included restarting road works after the monsoon; starting development work in UT villages, purchase of PPE kits, reauction of food booths in Sector 48 and setting up of an animal incinerator plant in Sector 25 West.People who booked community centres, open spaces and parks for events could not organise the events there because of the lockdown and curfew due to the Covid-19 outbreak.There were 493 bookings made and 150 persons have already sent applications demanding refunds from the MC, which manages the centres. The money to be refunded includes ₹55.51 lakh for renting the venue, ₹10.07 lakh as goods and services tax (GST) and ₹40,000 as cleaning charges.Even though the MC had deposited the GST amount with the excise and taxation department, the House decided that the amount will be refunded.As there appeared to be no definite timelines for the pandemic situation to ease the MC decided to formulate provisions in the refund policy for existing or similar future calamities.The House decided to add three more members to the purchase committee set up to buy personal protective equipment (PPE) kits, hand sanitisers and gloves for the containment of Covid-19. An expert from the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research and two nominated members will be added to the committee to decide on the requirement and specifications of the safety equipment.Arun Sood, councillor and city BJP chief, said his party will provide 100ml hand sanitisers, PPE kits and masks to the MC. The House decision came on the submission of an estimate of around ₹2 crore for buying PPE kits.Major road repair and recarpeting work will also be carried out after the monsoon, between September to December, said KK Yadav, MC commissioner.Recarpeting work for which tenders had already been allocated would be sped up and completed before the monsoon, he said, assuring the house that the civic body had adequate funds for the completion of all the road works. Recarpeting work on several roads couldn’t be completed last year because of lack of funds.Among the various developmental works in UT villages approved by the House, an estimated spending of ₹10 crore for paver block and sewerage system in Manimajra got the green signal at the meeting.For the infrastructural improvements in the 13 villages recently added to the MC, civic works, including electricity, paver blocks, sewerage upgrade, water supply, and storm water were approved. The estimates for these works will be submitted with the administration for additional grant-in-aid.The proposal for reducing the reserve price of booths at Food Street, Sector 48, was also submitted before the House. As Sood suggested augmenting the amenities there for improving the response from bidders, the House decided to float tenders in August after providing basic amenities such as public toilets. In case of a poor response, reducing the reserve price would be discussed again.The city’s first animal carcass incineration plant is likely to come up in Sector 25 West even though an earlier proposal was made to set up the unit in Industrial Area, Phase 1. Plans were changed after opposition from local councillor Shakti Parkash Devshali.In the meeting held via videoconferencing for the first time, MC House members decided on the following:||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-mc-house-meet-66-lakh-booking-amount-for-community-centres-to-be-refunded/story-5j31lfRH2E0LbDyOn4TbIK.html

30-05-2020||Chandigarh||Delhi HC ruling on repealed graft law provision may affect CBI case against Hooda||A Delhi high court ruling on a repealed provision of the Prevention of Corruption Act could have a bearing on the corruption charges being heard by a CBI court against former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda.Justice Vibhu Bakhru of the HC in a May 22 judgment ruled that persons convicted of committing the offence of criminal misconduct under Section 13 (1) (d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act would not be absolved of their offences or the liability as the legislative intent of repealing this section was not to exclude the said offence from the scope of Act with retrospective effect.The HC gave its verdict on an appeal by former Jharkhand chief minister Madhu Koda convicted of criminal misconduct under Section 13 in the coal scam who argued that he was liable to be acquitted in view of the enactment of the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Act, 2018. Since the misconduct as contemplated under Section 13 (1) (d) is no longer an offence punishable under the Act due to an amendment, the benefit of the same ought to be extended to him, the appellant contended. CASE AGAINST HOODAThe CBI court hearing charges against Hooda and others in the Manesar land release case had stopped short of framing charges after the accused filed discharge applications disputing CBI’s move to bring into play Section 13 (1) (d) of Act which was repealed in 2018 when the law was amended by the Parliament. The court has not been able to frame charges against the accused and commence trial despite the fact that arguments on the charges got concluded in February.HC RULING SIGNIFICANTWhile the Supreme Court is yet to adjudicate the contentious issue of legitimacy of the repealed Section 13, the HC ruling is significant, legal experts say.“This court is unable to accept that the PC (amendment) Act, 2018 seeks to repeal the provisions of Section 13 (1)(d) of the Act as it existed prior to July 26, 2018 ab initio. Mens rea (the intention and knowledge of wrongdoing) is an integral part of the offence under section 13(1)(d). There is no reason to assume that the legislative intent of repealing this section was to exclude the said offence from the scope of PC Act with retrospective effect,” the HC ruled. This court is unable to accept that if it is established beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant had abused his position for securing a pecuniary advantage to Vini Iron and Steel Udyog Limited, the benefit of any beneficial construction of the PC (Amendment) Act, 2018 could be extended to him, the judge said.MANESAR LAND RELEASE CASE2007: About 600 acres acquired for HSIIDC for creating residential and recreational utilities in the Industrial Model Township (IMT), Manesar, was dropped from the acquisition process in 2007 on the orders of Hooda2015: CBI registered a case under Prevention of Corruption Act and IPC against unknown persons2018: CBI files charge-sheet in court, accuses Hooda, three former IAS officers, besides others of dropping acquisition proceedings to help real estate builders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/delhi-hc-ruling-on-repealed-graft-law-provision-may-affect-cbi-case-against-hooda/story-rGWm1EaOmysESEHu4fGEkN.html

30-05-2020||Chandigarh||Jalandhar MC lost Rs 5 cr revenue in two months of lockdown||The municipal corporation (MC) of Jalandhar has faced a loss of Rs 5 crore in revenue over the past two months that the curfew/lockdown has been in force. The MC’s major revenue sources are taxes on advertisement and property it collects from the public. No revenue has come in over the past two months. Arrears from the public are also an issue that plagues the civic body’s functioning. Mayor Jagdish Raja said for the period from 2013-14 to March 31, 2020, the MC had not received over Rs 50 crore on account of house and property tax from over 50,000 defaulters. In the fiscal year that has just ended, the MC earned Rs 29.3 crore against targeted Rs 40 crore. In 2018-19, MC collected Rs 28.5 crore against targeted Rs 40 crore amount. The MC has sent over 20, 000 notices, so far this fiscal, even warning defaulters of sealing of property. Yet, the public response has been tepid with only Rs 24.5 lakh accruing to it in this financial year to date, said a MC officer. Now, the MC has offered a one-month extension to avail the benefit of 10% scheme on property tax to June 30, in view of the prevailing covid-19 situation. The mayor added, “We have also extended one-time settlement (OTS) policytill June 30, allowing defaulters to clear outstanding for house tax, property tax, water and sewerage charges without any interest on pending amount. This outstanding is around Rs 50 crore and could help MC manage efficiently.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/jalandhar-mc-lost-rs-5-cr-revenue-in-two-months-of-lockdown/story-2cp8rundcikvzNTMk0l7QI.html

In a complaint sent to deputy commissioner-cum-club president Pradeep Agrawal via post, Singh has stated that a party was organised and members also took away liquor and beer cartons from the club.Alleging that his services were terminated when he tried to record the incident on his mobile phone, Singh, a resident of Gujjarwal village, demanded that the DC should ensure his safety and reinstate him as the security supervisor of the club.When contacted, Singh said, “I was deputed at the club when the seven executive members came on Sunday afternoon. They had lunch that was brought from outside and then they asked the staff to serve liquor. The party continued till 5pm and the members asked two staff members to keep the liquor and beer cartons in the cars of three members through the back gate. As the members had no gate pass or bill for the liquor, I made a video with my mobile.”Singh had alleged that after the members came to know about the video through a staff member, they summoned him inside the hall and abused him. “They snatched my phone and returned it after deleting the videos the next day. When I contacted my security officer, he said my services were no longer required,” Singh added. The club had landed in a controversy after an audio surfaced on the internet wherein two members of the club were discussing about the party.On Wednesday, an internal inquiry was submitted to the DC by club general secretary Nitin Mahajan. “The facts stated by the supervisor in his letter are in complete contradiction to the claims made by the executive members. A few staff members also gave their statement that no liquor was served, but the letter has raised doubts. The members claimed the 109 beer bottles taken out were expired,” he said.Mahajan and two women executive members did not go to the club that day. Despite multiple attempts, DC Agrawal could not be reached for comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lodhi-club-party-row-security-supervisor-slams-claims-made-by-executive-members-writes-to-ludhiana-dc/story-KaHAsGsFl7SACvCDwE6gmK.html

The MoU was signed by NAREDCO’s UP chapter in the presence of chief minister Yogi Adityanath in Lucknow on Friday, news agency PTI reported. “We have signed an MoU with the UP government for providing employment opportunities to 2.5 lakh labourers of UP who have returned from different states because of coronavirus,” NAREDCO-UP President RK Arora told reporters in a video conference. He called the pact a “win-win situation for labourers, the state government and homebuyers.“This MoU is a win-win situation for labourers from UP, state government developers and also homebuyers. Labourers will be absorbed and construction work will start,” Arora said.According to the initial pact, around 1.25 lakh workers will be absorbed at Ghaziabad, Noida and Greater Noida in the national capital region, while the remaining 1.25 lakh will be taken for projects across other cities in UP.Arora said the association, with 250 developers as members of its UP chapter, will also provide training to labourers to undertake construction works.The real estate sector has been badly hit following the nationwide lockdown imposed on March 25 to control the spread of coronavirus disease Covid-19. Earlier this month, Union housing and urban affairs minister Hardeep Puri had said that reverse migration of labourers and a breakdown of construction material supply chains had adversely affected real estate projects and that they will take quite some time to restart in full gear across the country.“As we have already seen stalling of a lot of projects in Delhi-NCR [National Capital Region] due to various reasons, leading to a lot of litigations, etc, it is vital to take remedial measures now to ensure that Covid-19 does not lead to a complete breakdown of the real estate sector. Such a situation will result in many stalled projects resulting in a huge losses for all the stakeholders especially homebuyers,” he while speaking at a webinar on the 3rd anniversary of the Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA).However, later with relaxations announced in the curbs, the government allowed construction activities in urban areas where workers were available on site and no workers were required to be brought in from outside. On Friday, after the MoU with the Yogi Adityanath government, NAREDCO-UP president RK Arora said the association will get data of labourers from the state government, after which it will run an awareness campaign to attract labourers on their sites.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/real-estate/real-estate-body-naredco-to-employ-2-5-lakh-up-migrant-workers-in-projects-across-state/story-UT1OUVNuEKSBO8tVY4QSsI.html

Of the 26.3 lakh hectares to be covered under paddy cultivation this year, the state agriculture department has set the target area under direct seeding of rice at 4 lakh hectares, which is 20% more than that last year. Paddy has already been sown on 1.8 lakh hectares through DSR process in the state.“More rain in coming days will help farmers who are going for direct seedig method,” said Sutantar Kumar Airi, director, state agriculture department.Airi said there is no need of puddling and heavy irrigation at the time of sowing under the DSR process, but farmers need to irrigate fields after sowing.However, the uninterrupted power supply to tubewells for eight hours will be resumed by Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) before the start of paddy transplantation (June 10).The DSR process consumes much less water than the traditional the sowing method. Under DSR, paddy seeds are sown almost like wheat.

As per the health department bulletin, the state’s Covid count reached 1,721, with 31 positive cases being detected in Faridabad and 19 in Sonepat. Health department officials said the cases in Gurugram were expected to further increase as to and fro movement of people has increased during the relaxations in lockdown norms. Blaming movement from Delhi for the sharp increase in infections in the state, home minister Anil Vij on Friday said the districts recording such a spike were abutting the national capital. “Gurugram alone has recorded over 500 cumulative positive cases while Faridabad has 307 positive cases and Sonepat 199,” a health official said. Vij said he has sent a team of officials led by additional chief secretary, health, Rajeev Arora and director general, health services to NCR districts to analyse the situation. He said accordingly, the state government will take a decision on whether or not to declare these NCR districts as red zones. Vij, who also holds the charge of health portfolio, had on Thursday sought stringency in free movement of people from the national capital following an increase in the number of Covid-19 cases in Haryana’s NCR districts. The fresh curbs meant that people not carrying e-movement passes and not falling in the approved category of persons or services as per the directions of the ministry of home affairs will not be allowed to commute from Delhi to Haryana.“Following relaxations in lockdown 4.0, the to and fro movement of people from Delhi to Haryana had increased.

30-05-2020||Chandigarh||Free power to continue, Capt assures farmers||Amid growing criticism from farmer organisations and opposition parties, Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Friday said there is no plan to withdraw free power to farmers in the state.“Let me reassure our farmers that there is no plan to withdraw free power to agriculture in Punjab. I am cognizant of your economic condition and appreciate the hard work put in by you in every crop to grow food grain for the country. Free power will continue!” he tweeted.The CM’s clarification came two days after the state cabinet at its meeting held under his chairmanship agreed in-principle to switch from free electricity to cash transfer of subsidy to farmers through the direct benefit transfer (DBT) route from financial year 2021-22.The decision to introduce DBT for power subsidy, which is part of the reforms-linked additional borrowing allowed by the Centre, saw the opposition parties, particularly the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), go after the state government. Both parties have strongly opposed the move, accusing the Congress government of hurting the state’s beleaguered peasantry.SAD CORE COMMITTEE MEETS ON ISSUE TODAYThe Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) has called its senior party leadership for a meeting of its core committee, its top decision-making body on Saturday. “The committee will discuss the strategy for a state-wide agitation against the Captain Amarinder Singh government to force it to recall the decision on DBT,” said SAD secretary Daljit Singh Cheema.CM’S NERVOUS DENIAL A SIGN OF PANIC: SUKHBIRSAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal has described the CM’s denial of the government’s move to withdraw free power facility to farmers as ‘the desperate and nervous response of a CM who has been caught in the act’. “Amarinder has obviously felt the pressure of the warnings from the SAD and farmers over the past 24 hours,” Sukhbir said, adding that, “He is now creating a smokescreen to hide his government’s real intent, but he is still misleading the farmers on free power as he has not said a single word on his cabinet’s in-principle decision to replace free power with DBT.”He questioned, “Will you please explain what does your cabinet’s decision on DBT mean and how will the state government implement it if not by introducing metered supply?,” Sukhbir also declared that his party will ‘never let these diversionary tactics succeed. We will not let him scrap free power through the back-door’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/free-power-to-continue-capt-assures-farmers/story-YzMq8hyLbD3koEBs5vf7NP.html

The decision on observing Operation Bluestar anniversary will be taken after that.” Taking a serious note of recent fire incidents reported in gurdwaras due to short circuits, Giani Harpreet Singh said unnecessary electric appliances should be avoided inside shrines. “Meanwhile, Sarbat Khalsa-appointed parallel acting jathedar of Akal Takht Dhian Singh Mand will appear at the Akal Takht on the Operation Bluestar anniversary to read out his message in name of the community, said Jarnail Singh Sakhira, his representative in Amritsar.He said they are making arrangements for observing the anniversary to pay tribute to those killed in the 1984 army operation.However, the police are taking measures to prevent gathering inside the Golden Temple.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/decision-on-observing-op-bluestar-anniv-after-centre-clears-air-on-lockdown-takht/story-brSuOY8BbZvJsrE86cyFlM.html
30-05-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra Covid-19 tally crosses 60K; 8,381 recover in 24 hours||Maharashtra’s Covid-19 case tally crossed the 60,000-mark and death toll went past 2,000 on Friday, but the state also witnessed recovery of 8,381 patients, the most to be discharged in 24 hours. The state’s recovery rate rose to 43.38% from 31.26% on Thursday, with the total of recovered patients going up to 26,997. While the state reported 2,682 new cases, taking its tally to 62,228, the fatalities increased to 2,098 with 116 deaths recorded on Friday. Of these, according to the state health department, 46 deaths were from the past two days and the rest from the period between May 16 and May 26. Mumbai saw its Covid-19 case count rise to 36,932 with an addition of 1,447 cases and its toll rose to 1,173 with 38 more fatalities reported on Friday.State health minister Rajesh Tope said recovery rate improving was “a positive sign”. “The protocol change is one of the reasons for better recovery rate. But we are sending patients home only after ensuring they have no symptoms and there is no risk of them spreading the virus as antibodies have developed after ten days of admission,” said Tope, adding that the sudden spike in the recovery numbers on Friday was also because of the addition of numbers from the past few days. Dr Avinash Supe, former dean at King Edward Memorial (KEM) Hospital and a member of the expert committee appointed by the state to tackle coronavirus, said, the recovery rate had improved owing to segregation of patients and the subsequent line of treatment. “The change in discharge protocol by ICMR is one of the reasons for the improvement… it is [similar policy] followed all over the world. Patients are discharged only after ensuring there is no risk of them spreading the virus. It’s a good sign that although cases are rising, the recovery rate has improved and even mortality rate has improved to 3.37%,” said Supe. The state government, meanwhile, is likely to further relax lockdown curbs in red zones from Monday. During a meeting with the Cabinet secretary on Thursday, Maharashtra chief secretary Ajoy Mehta discussed the state’s exit plan from the ongoing lockdown. More commercial activities are likely to be allowed in red zones and inter-district transport activities may be permitted in non-red zones.The state, however, is wary of the likely surge in cases after easing restrictions. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray told district collectors and divisional commissioners to ensure that there was no surge in the cases. “We have no choice but to open up the lockdown to ensure that the state economy revives rapidly, but at the same time, our responsibility increases to ensure that the virus is chased away more aggressively,” Thackeray said.After having allowed activities at stadiums and sports complex during the fourth phase of lockdown, the state is expected to allow jogging and exercise activities at playgrounds and stadiums from Monday. “We are of the opinion that private offices, too, should be allowed to open with 33% of their staff being present. The Centre has already allowed them to operate outside containment zones. But a final decision is yet to be taken,” said a senior government official. The state government also hinted at a relief package to help fight the pandemic. Deputy chief minister and finance minister Ajit Pawar said, “We are facing a different sort of crisis and we also have to find a way out of this. The state government will soon declare a financial package for the people. The decision will be taken by the state cabinet.”Pawar also commented on the Rs21-lakh-crore package declared by the Centre. “There are many opinions about actual amount that the people will get… A view is that the daily wagers should also be considered in the package, as they earn money on a daily basis,” he said.Pawar said local people should come forward to take over the jobs in industries after an exodus of migrant workers from the state. “Migrant workers have gone back to their native places. I’m of the opinion that people from the state, especially from backward areas, should come forward to replace them. The state is also ready to provide them with the necessary training,” he said.The finance minister also admitted that the reverse migration from cities to rural areas has led to rise in Covid-19 cases in districts. “The central, state and local administrations are fighting the battle… It is also a fact that cases have increased in rural areas after people migrated from urban areas. But there is no need to worry if everyone takes all precautions,” Pawar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maha-tally-crosses-60k-8-381-recover-in-24-hours/story-vE4acR1eIA0FjGKwWnqPkI.html

30-05-2020||Chandigarh||Wedding bands go silent as 50-member attendance cap hits biz||Bagpipe player Mohan Pandey is a worried man as his team has not received any order to play musical instruments at wedding functions for the past two months. His family of five could soon face problems of even arranging food, with savings rapidly exhausting. A brass band team comprises 15-20 persons including musicians, mare handler and those carrying lights with barat or wedding procession. A bagpipe band has nine musicians, including trumpet players and a ring leader. Due to the coronavirus outbreak, marriages are now a low-key affair where only a few close family members remain present and the Center stipulating the gathering to be of less than 50 persons.Pandey’s team head Balbir Singh said,” Our band used to get orders from Malwa region and we often visited Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh to play instruments at weddings. Every year, between April-July, we got at least 15 invitations a month. This year, however, people want us to return money taken in advance. We are helpless.” Singh, who is also the chairperson of the Union of Punjab Bagpipers, said there are about 100 bands in the state and traditionally the post-wheat-harvesting season April onwards was when a sizeable section of the rural population solemnised marriages.“More than 20,000 musicians, including the dholis, members of bagpipe and brass bands in the state are battling for livelihood,” he said.Another musician Avtar Singh said, “Bagpipers and brass bands are usually in high demand for Shobha Yatras during gurpurbs and Hindu religious occasions. We were also regularly invited by Rajasthani customers for Gangaur festival and Jain festivals. This year, for weeks, there has been no customer call.”For a small entrepreneur like Pappu at Bathinda’s Sirki Bazar locality, the lockdown has come as a blow to his business as well. “I have to sell one of my four mares as no one is placing orders for chariot or mare for marriages. Per day diet expense for a mare is Rs 500 and I unable to meet it without any income. Band players should be exempted from the restriction of 50 guests at the weddings,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/wedding-bands-go-silent-as-50-member-attendance-cap-hits-biz/story-y4IMbw5vrxXINzuYCqdQJP.html
30-05-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab raises fine for spitting, not wearing masks in public to Rs 500||The Punjab government on Friday enhanced stricter penalties for violating guidelines issued to contain the spread of Coronavirus by increasing the fine for spitting and not wearing masks in public to Rs 500.The state government also increased the fine for violating the home quarantine to Rs 2,000. Previously, the state government imposed a fine of Rs 200 for not wearing masks, Rs 100 for spitting at public places, and Rs 500 for violating home quarantine guidelines.Taking cognisance of violations of the guidelines, health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu said penalties needed to be enhanced to keep Punjab safe from the coronavirus. The state government also fixed Rs 2,000 as fine for violating social-distancing norms by owners of shops or commercial places.A fine of Rs 3,000 will be imposed on owners of buses, Rs 2,000 on cars, and Rs 500 on auto-rickshaws and two-wheelers for violating social-distancing norms, Sidhu said.Non-payment of fine will attract legal action under IPC Section 188 (order promulgated by a public servant empowered by the law to do so), he said in a statement.He said the Amarinder Singh government is working round-the-clock to prevent the spread of the disease.He said Punjab became the leading state in the country in recovery of Covid-19 patients, which is around 91%.The minister said that officials not below the post of block development and panchayat officer, naib tehsildar and any official authorised by deputy commissioners can impose the penalties under the provisions of Epidemic Disease Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-raises-fine-for-spitting-not-wearing-masks-in-public-to-rs-500/story-XlSTc8POmZImmS4j2w1CNL.html
30-05-2020||Chandigarh||Private traders stay away from wheat purchase this Rabi season in Punjab||Private traders stayed away from wheat purchase in the mandis this Rabi season, preferring the open market sale scheme (OMSS) of the Food Corporation of India (FCI) where they get it cheaper.Of the total 127 lakh tonne of wheat procured so far this season, private traders have purchased only 57,000 tonne, which is just 0.45%. They bought 1.7 lakh tonne, ie 1.3%, of 131 lakh tonne in the corresponding period last season.The dip in purchase by private traders is being attributed to OMSS as well as Covid-19, as wheat procurement was done by calling farmers to mandis in batches to maintain social distancing and avoid overcrowding.“When we enter mandis, price goes up by Rs 10-20 per quintal even if we don’t make purchases in large quantities, benefiting the farmers,” said Mohinder Pal, a Rajpura-based trader who procures wheat on behalf of big companies such as Reliance and ITC.“In OMSS, traders got wheat cheaper by Rs 200-250 per quintal and many stayed away due to the coronavirus pandemic. In OMSS, we have to sacrifice on quality as the FCI sold wheat of the previous season whereas in mandis fresh produce is available,” he added. On Twitter, former chairman-cum-managing director of FCI Siraj Hussain said that the Punjab government’s purchase was 99.5% of total arrivals. He gave full marks to the officials engaged in procurement, pointing out that there were side effects – “private buyer have totally withdrawn from Punjab”.Hussain, who also worked as the Union agriculture secretary, attributed lack of interest by traders to higher taxes imposed on wheat purchase in Punjab, which includes 2.5% ‘dami’ charged by commission agents and 3% rural development funds and mandi fee each. Private traders are also required to pay 2% additional over and above the minimum support price.“There’s not much difference if private players have not entered the mandis. In the past also, their share was very negligible, which has seen a further slide this year,” said Anindita Mitra, director, food and civil supplies, Punjab. “We are happy that MSP has been paid to the farmers and this way a total of Rs 26,000 crore was pumped into rural economy,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/private-traders-stay-away-from-wheat-purchase-this-rabi-season-in-punjab/story-V4Q7fG8JcPv9LaR75hd1kN.html
30-05-2020||Chandigarh||Less than 1% cases required ventilator in Punjab||Even as there was a huge political uproar over lack of ventilators in covid-19 facilities, as the state prepared itself to deal with the outbreak of coronavirus, data reveals that in Punjab the breathing machine was used in less than 1% of total cases.Of 2,197 patients, only 21 required a ventilator to date, data that the Punjab health and family welfare department has compiled shows.However, 19 (90%) could not survive and died, pointing to the low survival rate of positive cases after ventilator support is required to them. Two patients are still on ventilator, with one of them critical. Punjab had made provision of 600 ventilators in government and private facilities for covid-19 patients.“In Punjab, 83% of covid-19 cases remained asymptomatic and recovered without exhibiting any symptom. Ventilator is needed at a critical stage and we are lucky that use of this machine has remained below our anticipation,” Punjab’s nodal officer for Covid-19, Dr Rajesh Bhaskar said.Among 375 symptomatic patients that the state has seen to date, 5.6% needed a ventilator. Experts claims that is lower than in other countries, but despite the low utilisation of the machine, the health department will procure more ventilators.“It’s a battle in which the state cannot relax. You never know, when another outbreak might hit and the need for ventilators shoots up. We have to be prepared for the worst,” said a senior health functionary.Figures also show that oxygen support was required in less than 50 cases and most symptomatic patients recovered without serious ailments, except those who died.Among 42 death to date, covid-19 was confirmed in five cases post-death and in all death cases, co-morbidity was present.Punjab did highest sampling on May 27Sampling for covid-19 in Punjab saw its biggest-ever jump on May 27, when the state conducted 3,544 tests. Over the past three days, nearly 9000 RT-PCR tests have been done, with the number increasing by around 4% every day.For the two weeks previous to this, the daily average was between 2,000 and 2,100. The state now has a testing capacity of 4,810 a day across government and private facilities.“More random samples would be collected over the next couple of days to check the spread of the virus,” said Dr Bhaskar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/less-than-1-cases-required-ventilator-in-punjab/story-IXKIv2xsTuLwYJrpQppPcL.html
30-05-2020||Mumbai||HC asks court authorities to respond to plea seeking Kolhapur court premise for Covid ward||The Bombay high court (HC) has directed the high court administration and the principal judge of district and sessions court of Kolhapur to file their response to a plea that sought temporary allotment of the vacant premises of districts and sessions court in Kolhapur to the adjoining Chhatrapati Pramila Raje District Hospital to set up an isolation ward for Covid-19 patients. The petition filed by Dilip Desai, a social activist through senior advocate Satish Talekar, said that as Covid and non-Covid patients, which included pregnant women, were accessing the district hospital from the same entry and exit point there was an urgent need to segregate the patients. The petition had further said that the court authorities and principal judge refused a request from the Kolhapur District Disaster Management authority to hand over the court premises, which was lying vacant for six years, for setting up the isolation facility for Covid patients and urged the court to pass appropriate directions in the larger interest of non-Covid patients. In the previous hearing on May 26, the division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice KK Tated had directed the petitioner to implead the registrar general of the Bombay HC and principal district and sessions judge which the petitioner complied with. On Friday when the matter came up for hearing, the high court and principal judge represented by senior advocate Milind Sathe was asked to respond to the grievance made in the plea by Monday.

30-05-2020||Mumbai||Somaiya seeks HC intervention to rope in private ambulances||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Kirit Somaiya has moved the Bombay high Court seeking directions to the state government to increase the number of ambulances in the city and to rope in private ambulance providers to tackle the shortage in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.A division bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and justice KK Tated wgile, while hearing the petition filed through advocates Gaurav Mehta and Shiwani Agarwal for Dhruve Liladhar & Co., was told that ‘108 ambulance services’ provided by the government has only 93 vehicles in Mumbai which is insufficient considering the number of calls it receives to ferry both Covid and non-Covid patients each day. The advocates submitted there are around 3,000 ambulances run by private operators that have been withdrawn during the lockdown.“It is shocking and surprising to note that there have been significant amount of disappearances or withdrawals of these private ambulance services from hospitals and/or the streets of the city,” the plea states.Pointing to the problems faced by Mumbaiites due to the shortage of ambulances, the petition states, “Citizens are waiting for almost entire day in various cases for an ambulance to reach them. Whilst the petitioner appreciates efforts being taken by the Covid-19 warriors, there has to be basic infrastructure in the form of ambulances provided by the government to connect people with healthcare workers.” The petition filed against state health minister Rajesh Tope and other government authorities further said that nearly 93% privately operated ambulances are absent and government ambulances are insufficient.The petition has also sought details from the state government on action proposed by it to deal with shortage of ambulances and urged the court to direct the government to take necessary steps to bring the missing ambulances back in the system to aid Covid warriors.After hearing the submissions, the bench directed the state and the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation to respond with the details sought in the plea and posted the matter for hearing on June 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/somaiya-seeks-hc-intervention-to-rope-in-private-ambulances/story-FtZx3jVAJsLiwwGrf7YaLO.html
30-05-2020||Delhi||DU considers skipping sports trials this year; admissions under some ECA categories unlikely||The Delhi University (DU) may not conduct trials for sports quota admissions to undergraduate courses this year given the situation wrought by the Covid-19 pandemic, university officials said, adding that the admission under this category will be granted based on merit certificates. The university is also considering stopping admissions under certain extra curricular activities (ECA) for the academic session 2020-21 as there is no recognized body to issue certificates for the same.In DU colleges, 5% supernumerary seats are reserved under these two categories collectively in each course. Every year, the colleges submit a list sports and activities for which they need students to the admissions branch. Under the sports quota, candidates have to appear for trials in their preferred discipline. While the trials carry 60 marks, another 40 marks are allotted based on merit certificates. Under the ECA quota, trials are conducted at two levels until last year, carrying a weightage of 75 marks. The remaining 25 were allotted based on merit certificates.The DU offers admission under the sports quota in 27 disciplines including archery, athletics, cricket, football, badminton, hockey, swimming, wrestling, tennis, judo, and basketball, among others. Under ECA, there are 14 recognised activities — creative writing, dance, debate, fine arts, music, music instrumental (such as tabla, harmonium, sitar, dholak, drums, guitar, and sarod), theatre, NCC, NSS, and yoga, among others. The candidates are first shortlisted on the basis of merit certificates earned over the last three years. Those shortlisted, have to report at different venues for centralised trials.However, this year, due to the social distancing norms to control the spread of Covid-19, the admissions department is considering skipping the trials under the sports quota and giving admissions on the basis of certificates.Shobha Bagai, the head of the University’s admission department, said it’s easier to ascertain the authenticity of sports certificates than ECA certificates. “It’s a huge risk to call candidates to the campus for sports and ECA trials this year. Also, it will not be possible for students to travel from different states to appear for the trials. So, we are considering if admissions can be given on the basis of certificates issued by authorised sports bodies. In the case of ECA, there is no such system, and students sometimes submit certificates issued by residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) or local bodies. It becomes difficult to ascertain the authenticity of such certificates since we do not have any list of recognised bodies for ECA unlike sports. Therefore, we have to see if for a year, we can forgo admissions under ECA,” she said.Bagai said since these seats are supernumerary in nature, it will not affect the total intake of courses. “Also for some ECA disciplines, we can try to see if a candidate can upload a video of his/her performance to obtain the admission. All these are being considered. We need to discuss these issues with our statutory bodies before taking a decision,” she said.DU has already announced that it will shift the entire admission process online the coming academic year.A senior official, requesting anonymity, said some admissions can be made under ECA disciplines such as National Cadet Corps, a tri-services youth organisation, and the National Service Scheme (NSS), a social service organisation for youths. Pankaj Sinha, a member of the university’s sports council, said the university should wait until July before taking a decision.”There is a possibility that things will return to normal by August and we may be able to conduct trials for sports admissions then. We can call students in small batches for the trials to maintain social distancing,” he said.Several teachers said instead of conducting centralised trials, DU should ask colleges to conduct their own trials. “It will help in maintain social distancing. The administration should not forgo some ECA categories since many students who are not academically strong rely on their talent to secure an admission,” Rajesh Jha, a member of the executive council, Delhi University, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/du-considers-skipping-sports-trials-this-year-admissions-under-some-eca-categories-unlikely/story-S0UDVYzifj1z4w0ka9uACP.html
30-05-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt details steps taken to reduce delay in disposing Covid infected bodies||The Delhi government on Friday told the High Court that they had taken urgent steps to ensure there was no delay in the disposal of the bodies of persons who died of Covid-19 or were suspected to have died of the disease. The High Court had, on Thursday, taken suo moto cognisance of bodies piling up in Covid-19 mortuaries and filed a public interest litigation ( PIL).In the PIL, the court had quoted a Hindustan Times report dated May 28 that detailed how all 80 storage racks at the Covid-19 mortuary of the Lok Nayak Hospital were full and 28 bodies were stacked on the floor. The court also quoted the report stating that eight bodies were returned from Nigambodh Ghat on Tuesday because the facility was not in a position to accept more bodies, as only two of the three CNG furnaces were working and the bodies of those who had died five days before that were yet to be cremated.During the hearing on Friday, the Delhi government’s additional standing counsel Sanjay Ghose told the bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Sangita Dhingra Sehgal that urgent steps, such as extending working hours at the crematorium from 9am to 4pm to 7am to 10pm (from May 17), had been taken. “We have further informed the court that 29 bodies were disposed of on May 28, and on May 30 the remaining 35 bodies will be disposed of. Only bodies on which autopsies or investigations are to be carried out will be retained. We assured the Court that all steps are being taken to avoid such circumstances in the future,” Ghose said.The government’s additional standing counsel said that many other steps have been taken to resolve the situation. One such step he mentioned was allowing Lok Nayak Hospital to send bodies to others crematoriums and not just Nigambodh Ghat. “Lok Nayak Hospital was earlier authorised to send bodies only to Nigambodh Ghat. However, now it can also send bodies to crematoriums at Panchkuian and Punjabi Bagh,” he added.He also submitted that the government has authorised traditional wood-fired cremations, in addition to electric and CNG furnaces. PPE kits for all workers as well as bodies have been arranged, he said.Explaining why the problem arose, the government’s additional standing counsel said that an “unavoidable situation” had arisen due to several factors such as an increase in the number of Covid-19 deaths in those three-four days. He also said that these factors included the reduced capacity of Nigambodh Ghat to handle bodies on account of snags in furnaces and the workers at the crematorium refusing to handle bodies of those who died of Covid-19. He also said that relatives had refused to come forward to claim the bodies.Appearing for the North Delhi Municipal Corporation, standing counsel Akhil Mittal said that the civic body has extended the area around Nigambodh Ghat to accommodate the bodies since permission has been granted for wood cremation. He submitted that now 35 bodies can be accommodated for burning at one time (including CNG as well as wood furnaces). He submitted that a work order had already been issued in April for the replacement of three CNG furnaces at the crematorium. The crematorium is under the jurisdiction of the North Delhi Municipal Corporation, while the Lok Nayak Hospital is run by Delhi government. The hospital is also the largest dedicated Covid-19 hospital and is currently not admitting any non-Covid cases. On Friday, the hospital had 607 Covid-19 patients of the total 2,305 admitted in different hospitals across the city. The number of confirmed deaths in Delhi due to Covid-19 on Friday evening was 398. The counsels for the other municipal corporations assured the court that they would take adequate steps to avoid such conditions in the future. The bench, following this, directed that this situation should not be repeated and no body should be returned. It sought a status report from the authorities and posted the matter for June 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-govt-details-steps-taken-to-reduce-delay-in-disposing-bodies/story-cdIQfUHsHi7N7bDuID5YoK.html
30-05-2020||Delhi||RWAs demand cap on Covid-19 treatment in private hospitals||With the Delhi government registering a sharp jump in the number of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in the Capital, residents want the government to cap the cost of treatment in private hospitals and nursing homes, just like Maharashtra has.The Delhi government had, on May 25, ordered 117 hospitals and nursing homes to reserve 20% of their beds for Covid-19 patients. As per the Delhi government order issued by Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS), “These 117 private hospitals shall bill the Covid-19 patients as per their respective schedule of charges.” Citing the Maharashtra government’s decision to cap treatment cost, civil society members and residents’ welfare associations in Delhi are demanding similar action by the Delhi government.The Maharashtra government’s health department issued new guidelines on May 21 under which private hospitals have been allowed to charge up to ₹4,000 daily for the treatment of Covid-19 patients in a general ward, ₹7,000 in an intensive care unit (ICU) and ₹9,000 on a ventilator.Earlier this month, members of Save Our City Campaign, an association of RWAs, federations and social activists, wrote to Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal requesting the government to standardise the cost of consumables, medicines and treatment.Rajiv Kakria, the convenor of Save Our City campaign, said, “When the government has capped the cost of hotel rooms used for Covid-19 care and stopped schools from increasing the fees, why can’t it do the same for private hospitals?”He added, “These are testing times and the government should take measures to safeguard the interest of citizens. Like the Maharashtra government, Delhi government too should cap the cost of treatment for Covid-19 in private hospitals.”The cost of room charges should be decided as per the facility available at the hospitals. “The government can divide these hospitals into three-four categories as per the facilities available there. The cost of room rent, etc. can be fixed accordingly. But it is important that a decision in this regard be taken immediately, as the number of cases is increasing with each passing day,” Atul Goyal, president of URJA, an association of RWAs in the city, said. It is not just the cost of per day stay which the residents want the government to control, they say that hospitals shouldn’t charge patients for the Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) kits either. BS Vohra, the president of East Delhi RWAs joint front, said, “This is not the time for hospitals to make a profit. The PPE kits are for the safety of their staff. They shouldn’t charge patients for them. We request the government to provide PPE kits to hospitals.”Dr Girish Tyagi, the president of Delhi Medical Association, said, “This is an emergency. The government should discuss with doctors and private hospitals and devise a formula for the cost of treatment in the private setup, which is agreeable to all.”When asked about the matter, a senior Delhi government official said, “There are 3,800 beds in government hospitals, of which one-third are occupied. The facility in government hospitals is free of cost. Moreover, we have passed an order today (May 29) wherein five hotels have been attached to five hospitals to increase the capacity and have capped the cost per day. Also, we have created isolation facilities in 10 hotels.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/rwas-demand-cap-on-covid-19-treatment-in-private-hospitals/story-85oT2iZHKbNTDEvapVVEXJ.html
30-05-2020||Delhi||Gyms, salon owners seek govt nod to open shops from June 1||With the fourth phase of the lockdown set to end on May 31, gyms, fitness centres and salon owners’ associations have written to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal urging him to allow the reopening of these ventures from June 1, but with strict safety precautions in place. Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe associations as well as app-based beauty and wellness service providers have shared a long list of measures that they are ready to take in line with social distancing norms once they are allowed to open shop. This includes downloading of the Aarogya Setu app by both clients and staff, PPE kits for all staff members, turning away walk-in customers, using disposable and sterilised equipment, and sanitisation of the gym exercising area every 45 minutes, among others. There are an estimated 5,500 gyms and over 5,000 salons registered across the city, as per these associations. “We have written to the CM as well as to Delhi labour minister Gopal Rai to consider reopening gyms, fitness studios and salons from next month. We have been suffering losses. We have a complete strategy in place to open shop while maintaining social distancing and ensuring safety of customers,” said Chirag Sethi, vice-president, Delhi Gym Association. Some of these measures, he said, including deploying staff in PPE kits at the entry of shops for thermal screening of clients, maintaining a minimum of six feet between machines and disinfecting equipment every 45 minutes. “We will request people to get new memberships and book slots online,” Sethi said. Currently, gyms and salons are closed in Delhi, as per the Delhi-specific guidelines for the fourth phase of the lockdown. In several cities, including neighbouring Gurugram, salons and barbershops have opened since May 3, during the third phase of the lockdown. A senior Delhi government official said, “A decision on the matter will be taken by the government after the Centre issues the new set of guidelines for the period from June 1.” Meenakshi Dutt, vice president, Delhi Salons Association, said they have written a number of letters to the CM and the deputy CM to allow the opening of salons given that the retail and wholesale markets have been allowed to open with restrictions. “Salons and parlours in Delhi employ around 3 lakh people, most of whom come from modest backgrounds. They have been jobless for almost two months and are surviving on 50% salaries. For how long can all of us survive without work with rents and bills to pay? We are ready with a standard operating procedure (SOP) to reopen the shops keeping everyone’s safety in mind,” Dutt said. She said all salons have been asked to impart at least a week’s training to staff before reopening. “Also, we will ensure clients and staff download the Aarogya Setu app and keep their bluetooth on, only after which they will be allowed entry. Walk-in customers will not be allowed and prior appointments will be mandatory. Disposable kits will be used for each customer and the equipment will be sanitised after use,” she said. Brijesh Goyal, convenor, Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP) trade and industry wing, said he had also received requests from these sectors and will be sending a recommendation to the government in this regard. “Most of these establishments run out of rented properties with high rents and maintenance bills to pay. Besides, they employ a large number of both skilled and unskilled workers,” Goyal said.App-based service providers such as Urban Company (formerly Urban Clap) too have appealed to the government to allow restarting of services. “We have appealed to the Delhi government on multiple occasions to allow us to resume at-home beauty and wellness services. We believe, in the near term, customers will be keener to have services delivered to them at home rather than stepping out. We have in place a comprehensive set of protocols for providing these services. We will not be catering to containment zones,” said Mukund Kulashekaran, SVP Beauty and Wellness Vertical, Urban Company.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/gyms-salon-owners-seek-govt-nod-to-open-shops-from-june-1/story-KGd2T2ZmE9Z7VcbvlXWzFK.html

30-05-2020||Chandigarh||2,932 e-challans issued for speeding in 25 days of lockdown in Chandigarh||Since May 4, when the curfew was lifted in the city and people were allowed to drive, the Chandigarh traffic police have issued 2,932 traffic violation information slips (TVIS) or e-challans for speeding.The challaning drive began promptly on May 5. The traffic police used the three recently-acquired automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) systems to issue the challans.The machines read the number plate and the speed of the vehicle before issuing a challan. After the 7pm restrictions on traffic movement are lifted, these will be used at night as well. The device can be installed on a tripod or placed in a vehicle. It is light-weight and can be installed at different locations.Taking to Twitter, deputy inspector general of police (DIG, traffic) Shashank Anand said, “It is a myth that it takes 21 days to change a habit. Some people surely need more time,” commenting on how people were still speeding despite not getting to drive between March 24 and May 4.30% OF TOTAL SPEEDING CHALLANS OF 2019 ISSUED IN JUST 24 DAYSIn just 24 days, the ANPR systems have already issued 30% of the total 8,712 challans that were issued for speeding in 2019. DIG Anand said these machines were being used before the lockdown to train the operators, but this was the first time they were being used to challan.The e-challans, however, haven’t been sent by post to the defaulters yet. Speaking about this, deputy superintendent of police (DSP, traffic) Kewal Krishan said, “We have only been sending text messages about the e-challans.” He added that they have tied up with the postal department to send the remaining challans via speed post. Compounding fees for speeding offences is ₹1,000. The driving licence of the offender is also suspended for three months. The department, for now, is only processing challans related to breaking lockdown restrictions and social distancing rules where vehicles are being impounded.DIG Anand said a portal to start online challan payment will be launched shortly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/2-932-e-challans-issued-for-speeding-in-25-days-of-lockdown-in-chandigarh/story-2m8fXHeDqhLK89GzogM2HJ.html

Till the pendency of the issue, the fee payments will be held back. No stone will be left unturned and the matter will be taken to every administrative and judicial machinery, till a favourable result is reached.”Monica Sharma, principal, Ashiana Public School, Sector 46, refused to comment and the director of the school did not respond to the queries.“I just told them that our fee structure was within the limits of the education department’s order.

30-05-2020||Gurugram||Authorities identify 79 key waterlogging points in Gurugram||As many as 79 key waterlogging points have been identified across the city each of which will be monitored by CCTV cameras to prevent flooding during the monsoon, a press release issued by the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) on Friday said.On Friday, officials of the district administration, MCG, and Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA), Haryana Shahri Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP), and Gurugram police met at the PWD rest house in Civil Lines to discuss monsoon preparedness.It was decided in the meeting that all of the 79 identified waterlogging spots will be monitored through CCTV cameras and different officers will be given the responsibility of managing these spots. The meeting was attended by MCG commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh, deputy commissioner Amit Khatri, GMDA chief engineer Pradeep Kumar, and MCG chief engineers ND Vashisht and Raman Sharma. “A joint team of civic officials will be visiting all the 79 points within the next four or five days and will check their current drainage condition. Depending on their condition we will either repair, upgrade, or establish new stormwater drains,” said Raman Sharma, chief engineer, MCG. The 79 waterlogging points include Hero Honda Chowk, Narsinghpur, Vatika Chowk, Subhash Chowk, IFFCO Chowk, and AIT Chowk.The decision to monitor waterlogging points comes at a time when both GMDA and MCG officials are running out of time to clean drains across the city. Due to the coronavirus outbreak, the process for floating tenders for cleaning stormwater drains only commenced in mid-April. There are many areas in the city for which tenders are yet to be allocated to contractors. Even in areas where tenders have been allocated, work is progressing at an extremely slow pace as contractors are facing workforce shortages as many migrant workers have returned to their home towns.In Friday’s meeting, which was chaired by VS Kundu, chief executive officer (CEO) of GMDA, MCG, and GMDA officials also decided to work together for monsoon preparedness and for dealing with waterlogging in the city. They will also form a WhatsApp group to share information rapidly.“A flood control room will be set up soon and an adequate workforce and machinery will be made available for it. Officials have been instructed to constitute a rapid action team,” said Kundu, as per the official release.On Wednesday, HT had reported that the GMDA is planning to set up a flood control room near the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway. The exact location for the flood control room is yet to be decided even as tenders worth ₹41 lakh have been floated for it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/authorities-identify-79-key-waterlogging-points-in-gurugram/story-yOZ9Mx98xqpLf9MKlrDFeO.html

Although the family had pointed other weak spots that time, nothing was done about them leading to the Friday’s collapse, Singh said.The family, however, does not want to take up the matter with local police and are content with only the repairs by the management. Noida police officials said that they are aware of the case but cannot take legal action unless the family files a formal complaint.Surprisingly, the developer of the society denied the incident. “Nothing of the sort has happened, and we have anyways given the handover to the Apartment Owners’ Association (AOA). This fall is in their purview,” said Prashant Tiwari, CMD, Prateek Group.On May 27, a similar collapse had occurred at a flat in Ajnara Homes society in Greater Noida West in which a seven-year-old boy had sustained head injuries. The family had filed a case with the Bisrakh police after which three people from the developer and management end were arrested.The Friday’s case has residents worried for long term safety in the society.“There are visible cracks and damage in other flats and balconies.

The Uttar Pradesh government wants to create jobs for daily wage earners, who have lost their livelihood due to the nationwide lockdown imposed on March 25 to prevent the spread of Covid-19. The Uttar Pradesh NAREDCO president RK Arora, along with other developers, signed an MoU with the UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath in Lucknow on Friday morning. A delegation of developers from Noida, Greater Noida and Yamuna Expressway areas met the chief minister and assured him that they will employ the migrants, who have returned to their respective home towns from other states since March 25. Apart from NAREDCO, other industrial bodies and organizations also signed MoUs with the state government to provide at least 7.5 lakh jobs to these migrants.“We are committed to provide jobs to migrants, who have returned home from different states. We have also formed a migrant commission for that purpose. The government with the help of industry leaders will employ all these migrants,” said Alok Sinha, agricultural production commissioner, Uttar Pradesh.According to NAREDCO, the developers will employ 60% of out of 2.5 lakh migrants in various construction sites in Noida, Greater Noida, Yamuna Expressway and Ghaziabad.“The remaining migrants will be employed in cities like Meerut, Lucknow and other districts. We will restart construction work at our sites from next month as we are busy with mobilising the workforce. The UP government will help the developers to restart the work by accepting the demands regarding the financial issues,” said RK Arora president UP NAREDCO.The developers in Noida, Greater Noida and Yamuna Expressway have demanded that the government should stop charging stamp fee from buyers who want to purchase flat in the next one year, give additional time to complete the under-construction flats, postpone the payment of monthly instalment of housing land cost, and other benefits.“Apart from these benefits, the government should also restructure the business loans, which have been taken by the developers for their housing projects,” said Harendra Yadav, a member of NAREDCO.The UP government has formed a committee that is looking into the demands of the developers.“The committee will soon take a decision on these demands made by the builders so that they can restart work and revive the business,” said a UP government official, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/up-government-signs-mou-with-realtors-to-employ-migrants-who-returned-to-their-home-towns/story-GCKbuW4kYBi4jPfYObFZJJ.html

30-05-2020||City||HT Chandigarh Readers’ Take: In a lockdown, set joy, creativity free in children||MEDITATION, YOGA CAN HELPThe Covid-19 outbreak has disrupted people’s lives around the globe. Parents should try helping their children sail through this dark phase peacefully and calmly. It is essential for parents to remain patient and look after the needs of their children. This will result in strengthening of their relationship and also enable them to work together as a team. Parents should involve children in various household activities instead of criticising them for not doing anything. It is important and advisable for parents to attentively listen to their children and talk to them about things in a very constructive and optimistic manner. Make it a point to never overreact to anything annoying that the child might say or do. Try and build the child’s confidence by rewarding them for little achievements. However, make sure it’s not a bribe . Meditation and yogic exercises will also help. A parent is the only force that can help a child develop a positive attitude towards life.Priyanaaz VirkREFRESH OLD MEMORIES, TELL THEM STORIESAs parents we need to understand that the present scenario is not easy for children to deal with as they are stuck indoors with limited physical activity, outings and contact with friends. So, first of all be, empathetic. Their boundless energy can be channelised by adding a variety of activities in their daily schedule. Apart from online school, hobby or tuition classes they can be encouraged to do age- appropriate household chores like watering plants, filling up water bottles and so on. A physical workout time can be set. Revisit old memories by going over old photographs and videos and share the stories associated with them. This may be a good time to nurture the parent-child bond as there are limited outside influences and they are more receptive. With positivity and patience we can sail through these times smoothly.Roopali Virk, Mohali SIMPLE ACTIVITIES HAVE MOST VALUEChildren, who are compelled to remain at home are the most affected during the lockdown. The rhythm and routine of going to school, meeting friends,the bonhomie of chirping children in the school bus has a thrill of its own. At this crucial time, parents have to handle them with care, patience,love and empathy. They must retain their cool. They should plan simple/interesting activities at home,viz locating places/countries on the atlas and look up words in the dictionary. The winners should be given small gifts. There could be fun games like imitating a favourite aunt or family member. Seek their help in laying the table or heating the dishes in the microwave and ask them for suggestions in resolving family matters.Usha Verma, ChandigarhTREAT CHILDREN LIKE FRIENDSParents should first talk to children about safety and hygiene to combat Covid-19. They should be informed about how the disease spreads but assured that it can be controlled adequate precautions are taken. Youngsters should be kept busy with indoor games. They should lend a helping hand in sorting out household chores. Only a limited time should be allocated to them to watch TV or work on the computer. Parents should treat children like friends, discuss the news and current events with them and tell them stories. Sumesh Kumar Badhwar, MohaliENGAGE THEM WITH READING, WRITING AND ARTPrimary school children are forgetting the art of writing. Parents need to sit with them and engage them in reading and writing besides teaching them drawing and painting. Ten to 15 -year-old children have learned enough to build on. They can also be involved in mental games like scrabble, chess, crosswords and Sudoku besides watching Discovery Channel for learning more about the world after study hours. However, children who have picked up unhealthy habits need to be handled with love, understanding and affection and treated by an expert counsellor. Try to involve them in doing household chores, besides cooking new dishes. Ensure all the family members eat together and encourage them to wash the dishes and cutlery they have used. This will not just ease the burden of household work on parents, but will also make the children self-dependent.Gurdev Singh, MohaliGIVE CHILDREN ADEQUATE MENTAL SPACEIn this hour of crisis, it is imperative that the parents give adequate mental space to their children instead of nagging them all the time. Help children accept the current vicissitudes of life. Simultaneously, it is essential that the teachers, too, do not overburden the students with homework. Instead, they must aid the children in keeping up with their respective syllabus. Only with sustained support and guidance of parents and teachers can our children evolve as mentally stable, brighter and progressive beings in the longer run. No tension and collective action ought to be the norm of the day.Surbhi NegiSPEND QUALITY TIME WITH THEMParents should set out a routine for their children and not allow them to go out when the Covid-19 infection is spreading. They should give the children some quality time and play with them and also ensure they remain safe. Avinash GoyalPARENTS AND CHILDREN CAN EXPLORE NEW INTERESTS TOGETHERParents need to view the lockdown time positively - a godsend opportunity to spend quality time with the children, cooking and eating, playing and exercising and reading and watching TV together, which would not have been possible in normal times. Both children and parents can help each other explore new skills such as singing, learning musical instruments, painting, baking and gardening. Parents with teenage children should ensure that in addition to requesting them to do day-to-day chores, this is the apt time for taking up creative projects like reading, writing, flower arrangements, a plethora of hobbies that every heart wants to take up at some point of time. Intellectual and philosophical discussions on human values across the dining table should also be initiated in these times when people are experiencing mental trauma because of the spread of coronavirus. Children should also be made aware of the importance of social responsibility. That rich and poor classes can happily coexist in society if assets are shared and the lives of the poor are made easy.Premila Verma, PanchkulaUNDERSTAND CHILD’S PSYCHOLOGY AND ACT ACCORDINGLYParents need to spend quality time with their children. They should narrate stories with moral teachings, share positive experiences and inculcate good values in the children. It’s important to understand the child’s psychology and act accordingly, but with love, affection and care. This is the good time to utilise and channelise their energies effectively. They should be kept busy pursuing their interests and kept away from social media and electronic gadgets.Abhilasha Gupta, MohaliPRAYERS, RELIGIOUS SERMONS HELPThe lockdown has turned to be a blessing in disguise for many parents , as they are able to spend more time with their children now. Most of the behavioural problems in youngsters stem from loneliness and upbringing in crèches or day care centres during the formative years of childhood . Parents should utilise the lockdown period in tending to the needs of the children according to their aptitude and preferences. From morning prayers, religious sermons to storytelling, games, puzzle solving, poetry and jokes, try to keep your children engaged all the time. Yogic exercises should be a part of the child’s daily routine. Breathing exercises and meditation can treat mental illness to some extent. Anil Vinayak, Amritsar MOTIVATIONAL TALKS, BOOKS SHOULD BE MADE A PART OF THEIR LIVESParents should ensure they lead by example and stay positive at a time when the Covid-19 pandemic has weakened the economic structure of the world and affected the mental health of many people. All of us should stay connected with each other to boost our morale. Besides the education of children, parents should make sure they continue with indoor activities such as yoga and gym and help their parents with household chores. Motivational talks (let them watch YouTube, videos) and books should also be made a part of their lives.Vikas Sharma, Ludhiana||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/our-take-in-a-lockdown-set-joy-creativity-free-in-children/story-NzwuoJECM1TqYuNjwXErgM.html

Students For Society (SFS), in their statement, said only partial information had been released leading to confusion among the students. They added that it was not clear whether the hostels that were converted into Covid wards would be free soon. “Where will the hostellers stay during the course of the examinations?” the members asked in the statement.National Students Union of India (NSUI)’s PU president Nikhil Narmeta said, “How can the university assure that norms will be followed outside the examination centres and students coming from other states will be quarantined first after coming here? We have been raising our concerns, but we are not getting any response.”SFI CONDUCTS SURVEYThe PU unit of Students Federation of India (SFI) conducted a survey in which 4,036 students of the university participated. Over 83% students thought the university was not well-equipped to protect the students against coronavirus, and 79.6% students said that examinations should not be held. “Majority of the students are against conducting examinations in July,” said Abhilash Rajkhowa of SFI.SATH, another student organisation of PU, demanded that examinations should not be held for this semester, and that any decision in this regard should be taken after consulting the student bodies and educational experts.SENATOR WRITES TO V-CMeanwhile, a PU senator, Jagdish Mehta, has written to the vice-chancellor seeking cancellation of all semester examinations. “In this time of fear, anxiety and insecurity, students are not mentally prepared to appear in examinations,” Mehta said in the letter.President of Panjab University Campus Students Council (PUCSC) Chetan Chaudhary said, “I have discussed the matter with the controller of examinations, and have been assured that examinations will be conducted only when a safe situation prevails.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/student-organisations-oppose-panjab-university-s-plan-to-conduct-examinations-in-july/story-Si3TyyEnIGylpzrP5FDnwJ.html

30-05-2020||Pune||Covid-19: Maharashtra’s centuries-old ‘palkhi’ tradition to mark a departure from the past||On the backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic, the much-revered palkhis (palanquins) of the pre-eminent saints of Maharashtra, Sant Dnyaneshwar and Tukaram maharaj, will reach Pandharpur by air instead of the annual pilgrimage on foot. This would mark a major departure for the Palkhi tradition of the last seven centuries.Following a meeting here on Friday, Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said, in view of the Covid-19 pandemic and the aggravated situation in Maharashtra, the palkhis with the silver paduka (footwear) of the saints will be carried by air to Pandharpur. This decision was announced after a meeting at the council hall here on Friday with the trustees of the temple trusts at Pandharpur, Dehu and Alandi.Every year in June, almost seven lakh to a million warkaris (pilgrims) from Maharashtra and the southern states of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, participate in the palkhi procession. The procession embarks from the pilgrim centres of Alandi and Dehu in Pune district and the pilgrims march through the day and rest at night, reaching Pandharpur after a fortnight.Pawar said that the tradition over the centuries “would be continued this year too. However, in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, the palkhis would be carried in a plane or a helicopter and not on foot.” He said the precise mode of transport would be decided after taking the weather situation into consideration as the pilgrimage takes place during the monsoons in the month of June. “If air travel is not suitable then the palkhis would be carried by bus, he said.The deputy chief minister pointed out that the Palkhi procession passes through Pune, Satara and Solapur districts all of which have been affected by Covid-19. The procession on foot would therefore not be advisable, he said.The guardian ministers of Solapur, Datta Bharne and Satara, Balasaheb Patil, respectively, agreed on the issue. On May 15, Pune Divisional commissioner Deepak Mhaisekar had held a meeting with the temple trustees and it was decided that a final decision would be taken on Friday in Pawar’s presence. The representatives of the warkaris (pilgrims) also agreed with the decision arrived at by the state government.Divisional commissioner Mhaisekar, Pune Police commissioner K Venkatesham, district collector Naval Kishor Ram and heads of the various temple trusts were among those present at the meeting.Pawar appealed to the devout not to plan a visit to Pandharpur this year but view the ceremony on television at home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-maharashtra-s-centuries-old-palkhi-tradition-to-mark-a-departure-from-the-past/story-bk37EEyairjsqILuhivZzK.html

30-05-2020||Delhi||Need system in place to manage night shelters: Delhi high court||The Delhi High Court on Wednesday said a system should be put in place for the maintenance of night shelters run by the Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB), while stating that there is a lack of communication protocol between All India Medical Sciences (AIIMS) and the Delhi government.A bench of Justice Vipin Sanghi and Justice Rajnish Bhatnagar said this could be solved by appointing nodal officers.The court issued the order after the AIIMS counsel told the court that none of the 22 outstation patients staying in the night shelter outside the hospital, who had tested Covid positive, ever came to the hospital. The Delhi government counsel had told the court that due to the inability to contact AIIMS authorities at the relevant time, the patients were shifted to Lok Nayak hospital and Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute.The court was hearing a plea by a lawyer Karan Seth through his advocate Arjun Sayal, who sought better facilities for outstation patients who have been residing in the night shelter outside the hospital. On Wednesday, the court was shown videos and photographs of the night shelter, following which the court said the allegations of the petitioner were “correct”. The court, expressing displeasure, said even though “it appeared that after its last order, senior officials of DUSIB and the chief secretary of Delhi took corrective steps, there is apprehension that the situation may go back to what it was once the court stops monitoring it.It noted that though DUSIB claimed it is maintaining entry registers but these may not be maintained with any regularity or seriousness”. The bench said several NGOs and social workers are offering social service only for the love of mankind at such like night shelters.“They would be, obviously, interested in seeing that such like facilities are run efficiently and the occupants are provided the facilities and services necessary to maintain human dignity…..We, therefore, direct DUSIB to accredit NGOs and individual social workers who are associated with the night shelters, and to involve NGOs and individual social workers in the matter of supervision of such night shelters,” the court said.It directed DUSIB to ensure only patients and their immediate attendants are permitted to occupy the night shelters at AIIMS, and other night shelters in the vicinity of other government hospitals in Delhi. “All other occupants, who are not receiving treatment at the government hospital concerned, should be shifted to the other night shelters managed by DUSIB,” the bench said, posting the matter for June 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/need-system-in-place-to-manage-night-shelters-delhi-high-court/story-4fy6wiEjgMcXb8C700ZfTJ.html

30-05-2020||City||Paddy seeds seized from Ludhiana store fail germination tests||The paddy seeds seized from Brar seed store, located on Ferozepur Road opposite the Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), have failed the germination test.Confirming the development, chief agriculture officer Narinder Singh Benipal said, “The store was selling the seeds at inflated rates by branding them as PR 128 and PR 129 (high yielding varieties).The department conducted a germination test, which the seeds samples failed. Now, samples have been sent to PAU laboratory for gene tests.”Director (agriculture) Dr Sutantar Kumar Airi, who visited the city to check the progress in the case, said the matter was being probed and all aspects were being looked into.PAU TO OPEN DOORS TO FARMERS FOR SEED TESTINGAmid the row over the spurious seed varieties, PAU has asked farmers to get their seeds tested from the university. Vice-chancellor Baldev Singh Dhillon said farmers who wish to get their seeds tested for authenticity and quality, could visit the university. “However, it would be difficult for us assess the seedlings (peeniri),” said Dr Dhillon.The development comes a day after various farmers’ organisations and Shiromani Akali Dal’s (SAD) submitted memorandums to deputy commissioners across the state, demanding that all farmers who had been duped should be identified and given financial compensation.The matter regarding sale of spurious seeds had come to fore after a farmer had submitted a written complaint to deputy commissioner, stating that PR 128 seed was being sold at Rs 200 per kg at Brar seed store, while PAU was selling the same variety for Rs 70. Following the complaint, the deputy commissioner had directed the Ludhiana chief agriculture officer to take action. On March 11, a team of agriculture and farmers welfare department of Punjab conducted a raid and took samples of PR 128, 129 varieties, a large quantity of filled bill books and samples of all other seed varieties found in the shop. The owner was booked under Section 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code.The Vigilance Bureau has also initiated a probe in the matter on the directions of chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh.ABOUT THE SEEDSOn February 19, PAU had recommended seven new varieties of paddy for general cultivation in Punjab. These included PR 128, PR 129 and HKR 47 of rice; J 1007 of fodder maize; J 87 of groundnut; JC 12 of maize and PCB 165 of bajra. All varieties were approved during the state variety approval committee meeting, held under the chairmanship of Punjab agriculture director Suntantar Kumar Airi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/seeds-confiscated-from-store-opposite-pau-fail-germination-tests/story-1hD1i7hDb3VBmp2e6255eK.html

One such group resides in the old Shedge wada in Shukrwar peth area, the group has been cooking and distributing food packets to the homeless for over a month.“All this started in the first week of April when we residents thought of cooking food and distributing it to the needy. Accordingly, we started the work. Residents in the wada and other well-wishers contributed funds and raw material to us. And we started cooking food daily and around 150 food packets are being distributed on a daily basis from last one-and-a-half months,” said Kalpana Shewale, a resident of Shedge wada.The property in Shukrwar peth is 70-years old and currently, houses 15 families with around 50 residents.

30-05-2020||Pune||Post-lockdown, cash flows, supply chain and labour shortage are top issues for industries: MCCIA||A survey conducted by the Mahratta Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture (MCCIA) here has revealed that supply chain issues, delayed cash flows and labour issues are among the major concerns of medium, small and micro-enterprises (MSME) in the Pune industrial belt, a week after the lockdown was lifted for industries.This second survey of 155 MSMEs consisting of manufacturing and service industries, was conducted a week after the lockdown was opened, while the first survey was conducted a month ago. Prashant Girbane, director general, Mahratta Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture (MCCIA) said, “The second survey, conducted in the week over three to four working days revealed interesting aspects about the top three issues. The survey revealed that 69% of the industries reported that supply chain issues and delayed cash flows were a major concern while 39% (61/155) said that labour issues (like migrant labourers going back and local manpower refusing to come back to work) was a major concern.Elaborating on these points, he said that cash flow was a major concern. While credit guarantees and liquidity measures had been taken by the central government, transmissions were happening through the bank but needed to be expedited. “The weighted average of the pending receivables of the MSMEs surveyed was between 2cr to 3cr, which includes receivables from the private as well as the public sector,” he said. With regards to supply chain, while movement of goods transport had been allowed, there were issues related to raw material availability and finished goods delivery as parts of the economy were still under red zone in Mumbai and Pune, Girbane said.On the labour front he said, 40 % of the companies had labour issues. “The government needs to ensure that the employment bureau gets more support and prominence so that workers will find it easier to join industry as well as help facilitate the return of the migrant workers with transport and health care,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/post-lockdown-cash-flows-supply-chain-and-labour-shortage-are-top-issues-for-industries-mccia/story-hUPjim71jqZ4hxat1dxXdN.html

When Jaspal asked, the gurdwara president and his aides said that they had booked another jatha for the gurdwara. “When I tried to reason this out with them, Jatinderpal and his accomplices slapped me many multiple times and also assaulted me. The other devotees in the gurdwara saved me,” said the complainant.The shrine’s president, however, denied the allegations. “Jaspal and his aides were running a parallel group against me in the gurdwara. I had even made several complaints against him to the police and administration, but to no avail. I will appear in the court rather than answering to the police,” said Jatinderpal.A case under Sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 341 (wrongful restraint), 506 (criminal intimidation), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon) and 149 (an offence is committed by any member of an unlawful assembly) of the Indian Penal Code at the Phase 1 police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/phase-4-gurdwara-president-booked-for-assault/story-pNgdzunsIrf8L3qM8b4WQL.html

It is natural that with the Covid-19 pandemic, parents cannot send their children to school,” Pawar said, adding, “The state government is thinking about schools restarting at a later date. To complete the curriculum, the government will cut the Diwali and Christmas vacations… but it’s all at the thinking level.”In response to Kadam raising the issue of school principals also being worried about reopening, Pawar instructed Kadam to give a message to all principals: “the government will not open schools in June”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/maharashtra-schools-will-not-re-open-in-june-dy-cm-ajit-pawar/story-pVCIHtx2Kkrlf0WTgqLKCN.html

30-05-2020||Pune||Poultry industry looks up as chicken consumption revives across states||Poultry farmers, traders and retailers, at the receiving end of fake news, courtesy social media, attributing consumption of chicken as likely sources of Covid-19, are now enjoying a windfall with prices of broilers having doubled from the early March rates.In March, chicken was retailing for Rs 100 per kg. The May 29 retail price for a kg of chicken is Rs220.Ramesh Khatri, president, Poultry Federation of India said, “The demand for chicken increased in almost all the states in India, but the situation of the poultry industry has not yet normalised. Right now, production is 20 per cent and demand is 25 per cent so the rates increased. When hotels and restaurants open, at that time demand would increase further. The poultry industry will not be able to match supply till June; but after July, the demand and supply ratio will even out and rates will return to normal. One thing is clear now, people do not have anything in their minds as to there being any relation between the coronavirus and chicken.”According to several retailers in Pune, on April 1, the wholesale price of broiler was Rs20 per kg. In the second week of April, wholesale prices touched Rs60 per kg. From the last week of April, the price of chicken has steadily increased and in May, crossed the Rs100 per kg benchmark. On Friday, chicken was selling for Rs120 to Rs130 per kg, which is even higher than the pre-Covid 2019 wholesale prices, which was at Rs70 to Rs75 per kg.Supply struggling to meet demand is being cited as the reason for the increasing broiler prices.Chicks on the farm need 50 to 60 days to reach the harvestable state. Between March and April, close to no birds were being reared on poultry farms considering the market situation. Supply of poultry feed and farm activities in general were affected by the lockdown.Ganesh Khairnar, A V Broiler company’s branch manager at Kalwan in Nashik district said, “The poultry industry has seen a bottom and a peak in last two months. As social media linked the coronavirus with chicken, it badly hit the industry. Poultry companies and farmers started throwing the birds in garbage as there was no demand. Even our company started selling chickens in weekly bazaars. There were no consumers. The situation has completely changed and people are more aware now. Demand for chicken has been improving since April as it is good source of protein.”P G Pedgaonkar, manager at poultry giant Venky’s (Venkateshwara Hatcheries group), said, “Now there is no stigma attached to eating chicken. The situation was worse in February and March due to social media. Despite raising a lot of awareness that there is no relation between chicken consumption and Covid-19, people were afraid and not taking any risk. Now citizens are aware and demand for chicken has increased. The average demand for chicken, pre-Covid in Maharashtra, was 3,000 metric tonnes. Now there is less supply, so rates are good. The current average demand for chicken is 1,200 to 1,300 metric tonnes and the supply side is almost at that level.”Pedgaonkar adds, “People are more aware about healthy food during lockdown due to Covid-19. The demand may keep increasing.”Poultry farmer Kiran Thakre from Nashik district said, “Two months ago, there were no buyers for chicken. Many farmers were worried as poultry companies were not buying chicken and the production cost was increasing. Now we don’t have birds and demand is increasing. Many farmers shut down in the month of March, but now, they too are starting their poultry business again.”Vikrant Patil, a Pune resident, said, “I love chicken, but social media gave a bad impression and my family members did not allow me to eat chicken. Now, during lockdown, I buy chicken two times in the week. Everywhere there are long lines for purchasing chicken in the city.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/poultry-industry-looks-up-as-chicken-consumption-revives-across-states/story-1dxzHK8LcXdGO2mXrqtIPN.html

30-05-2020||World||Covid-19 crisis: Italy to open travel as local officials fret over Lombardy||Italy’s health minister confirmed the country can go ahead with the plan to start allowing travel across the nation next week, even as some local governors oppose letting people from the hard-hit Lombardy region move freely.Data on the spread of the virus is improving and allows for the reopening among regions, Health Minister Roberto Speranza said in a statement. The announcement came after a late night meeting with Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte and various coalition party representatives and ministers.The government and regional governors have been at loggerheads over the fate of citizens from Lombardy, Italy’s richest and most populous region located around Milan and the epicenter of one of Europe’s worst virus outbreaks. Some regional authorities, including the governor of the Naples region, Campania, have threatened to close their borders to people coming from Lombardy once free travel within Italy restarts.“The trend is good almost in all the regions, which shows that the effects of the lockdown were extremely positive,” Giovanni Rezza, head of prevention at the health ministry, said in video comments about virus monitoring data on Friday.Though new virus cases continue to decline, Lombardy still has the highest ratio of new cases per 100,000 people, according to data published by the health ministry on the May 18-24 period, after lockdown measures were eased further. A total of 33,340 fatalities have been reported in Italy since the start of the pandemic in February, most of them in northern Italy and 16,079 of them in Lombardy, according to the latest data released Saturday. There were 416 new virus cases, down from 516 on Friday.Meanwhile the governor of Lombardy, Attilio Fontana, said last week he’d been given a police escort after growing criticism of his handling of the virus crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-crisis-italy-to-open-travel-as-local-officials-fret-over-lombardy/story-TSygMNDkpuigp76BFVq91H.html
30-05-2020||World||China says US action on Hong Kong ‘doomed to fail’||The mouthpiece newspaper of China’s ruling Communist Party said Saturday that the U.S. decision to end some trading privileges for Hong Kong “grossly interferes” in China’s internal affairs and is “doomed to fail.”The Hong Kong government called President Donald Trump’s announcement unjustified and said it is “not unduly worried by such threats,” despite concern that they could drive companies away from the Asian financial and trading center.An editorial in China’s official People’s Daily newspaper said that attempts at “forcing China to make concessions on core interests including sovereignty and security through blackmailing or coercion ... can only be wishful thinking and day-dreaming!”Trump’s move came after China’s ceremonial parliament voted Thursday to bypass Hong Kong’s legislature and develop and enact national security legislation on its own for the semi-autonomous territory. Democracy activists and many legal experts worry that the laws could curtail free speech and opposition political activities.China had issued no official response as of late Saturday, but earlier said it would retaliate if the U.S. went ahead with its threat to revoke trading advantages granted to Hong Kong after its handover from British to Chinese rule in 1997.“This hegemonic act of attempting to interfere in Hong Kong affairs and grossly interfere in China’s internal affairs will not frighten the Chinese people and is doomed to fail,” the People’s Daily said.In Hong Kong, small groups of Beijing supporters marched to the U.S. Consulate on Saturday carrying Chinese flags and signs protesting “American interference in China’s internal affair” and calling Trump “shameless and useless.”Elsewhere in the city, youthful activists including Joshua Wong held a news conference to welcome Trump’s announcement and try to downplay any economic fallout.Tensions between the U.S. and China over Hong Kong have increased over the past year, with the U.S. defending pro-democracy protesters who clashed with police last year and China vilifying them as terrorists and separatists.“It is now clear that Hong Kong is caught in the middle of major China-U.S. tensions,” said Tara Joseph, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong. “That is a real shame for Hong Kong and it will be a challenge in the months ahead.”Joseph said there were many unanswered questions about how the trading relationship will unravel and predicted that “it won’t be like flipping a switch.”U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo set the stage for Trump’s announcement by notifying Congress on Wednesday that Hong Kong no longer has the high degree of autonomy that it is guaranteed under the “one country, two systems” framework.Trump said Friday that his administration would begin eliminating the “full range” of agreements that had given Hong Kong a relationship with the U.S. that mainland China lacked, including exemptions from controls on certain exports.“China has replaced its promised formula of one country, two systems, with one country, one system,” he said, echoing statements by pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong.A Hong Kong government statement accused Trump and his administration of smearing and demonizing the government’s duty to safeguard national security and called allegations that the security law would undermine individual freedoms “simply fallacious.”“President Trump’s claim that Hong Kong now operated under ‘one country, one system’ was completely false and ignored the facts on the ground,” the statement said.Separately, Hong Kong Secretary for Justice Teresa Cheng told reporters that it was “completely false and wrong” to say the territory was losing its autonomy.She also criticized the U.S., saying “any other state that tries to use coercion or whatever means with a view to interfering with the sovereign right of a state to pass its own national security law is arguably infringing on the principle of non-intervention under public international law, and that is not acceptable.”Washington’s response could include U.S. travel bans or other sanctions on officials connected with the crackdown on last year’s pro-democracy protests, including members of the Hong Kong police force.“Whatever attempt at suppressing or intimidating Hong Kong officials there may be, I think it won’t succeed, because we believe what we are doing is right,” said John Lee, Hong Kong’s secretary for security.China decided to impose a national security law on the city after successive Hong Kong governments were unable or unwilling to do so themselves because of stiff public opposition. The one attempt to do so in 2003 was abandoned in the face of major protests.Beijing’s resolve to move forward appears to have been hardened by the months of anti-government protests last year and a determination to prevent them from coming back this summer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-says-us-action-on-hong-kong-doomed-to-fail/story-PB4CgxH2jdLUQauNTF0D9M.html
30-05-2020||World||Two NASA astronauts climb aboard SpaceX rocket for historic flight||Despite more storms in the forecast, two NASA astronauts climbed into their capsule Saturday for a second attempt at a history-making ride into orbit aboard a rocket ship built by Elon Musk’s SpaceX company.With the flight already delayed three days by bad weather, forecasters put the odds of acceptable conditions at 50-50 for the 3:22 p.m. liftoff of the 270-foot Falcon 9 in what would be the first launch of astronauts into orbit by a private company.It would also be NASA’s first human spaceflight launched from U.S. soil in nearly a decade.Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken pulled on their angular, white-and-black spacesuits with help from technicians wearing masks, gloves and black hoods that made them look like ninjas.Also read| Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken: All about NASA astronauts to be launched by SpaceXBefore setting out for the launch pad in a gull-wing Tesla SUV — another Musk product — Behnken pantomimed a hug of his 6-year-old son, Theo, and said: “Are you going to listen to Mommy and make her life easy?” Hurley blew kisses to his 10-year-old son and wife.SpaceX and NASA monitored the weather not just at Kennedy Space Center, where rain, thick clouds and the chance of lightning threatened another postponement, but all the way up the Eastern Seaboard and across the North Atlantic to Ireland. Waves and wind need to be within certain limits in case the astronauts have to make an emergency splashdown on the way to orbit.Their destination: the International Space Station, a 19-hour flight away.Ever since the space shuttle was retired in 2011, NASA has relied on Russian spaceships launched from Kazakhstan to take U.S. astronauts to and from the space station.“I would be lying to you if I told you I wasn’t nervous,” NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said before the launch attempt. “We want to do everything we can to minimize the risk, minimize the uncertainty, so that Bob and Doug will be safe.”Wednesday’s countdown of the rocket and its bullet-shaped Dragon capsule was halted at just under 17 minutes because of the threat of lightning.President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence planned to return for the second launch attempt.Because of the coronavirus outbreak, NASA severely limited the number of employees, visitors and journalists allowed inside Kennedy Space Center, and the crowd was relatively small, at a few thousand. At the center’s tourist complex, though, all 4,000 tickets for the launch were snapped up in a few hours.The space agency likewise urged others to watch from home, but spectators soon began lining the area’s beaches and roads. Signs along the main beach drag read, “Godspeed.”Among the spectators was Neil Wight, a machinist from Buffalo, New York, who staked out a view of the launch pad from a park in Titusville.“It’s pretty historically significant in my book, and a lot of other people’s books. With everything that’s going on in this country right now, it’s important that we do things extraordinary in life,” Wight said. “We’ve been bombarded with doom and gloom for the last six, eight weeks, whatever it is, and this is awesome. It brings a lot of people together.”NASA hired SpaceX and Boeing in 2014 to taxi astronauts to and from the space station, under contracts totaling $7 billion. Both companies launched their crew capsules last year with test dummies. SpaceX’s Dragon aced all of its objectives, while Boeing’s Starliner capsule ended up in the wrong orbit and almost was destroyed because of multiple software errors.As a result, the first Starliner flight carrying astronauts isn’t expected until next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/two-astronauts-climb-aboard-spacex-rocket-for-historic-flight/story-B8DNLp2RAwZj57RffiKYbM.html

He warned them that they would have been “greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons” if they had breached the security cordon and managed to enter the premises.Trump had earlier called the protestors “thugs” and warned them, deploying a controversial phrase used by a Miami mayor against civil rights activists in the 1960s, and later by a segregationist — — “When the looting starts, shooting starts”. The president tried to walk it back in a subsequent set of tweets.Demonstrators across the country chanted the same set of slogans as they marched peacefully or broke out into violence: “I can’t breath” — Floyd’s repeated pleas to the police officer who had him pinned to the ground with his knee to his neck for exactly 8 minutes and 45 seconds — “black lives matter” and “no justice, no peace”. Derek Chauvin, the police officer, was arrested on Friday and charged with third-degree murder. Protestors are demanding action against the remaining three police officers present at the time.In Minneapolis, where Floyd was killed Monday, protestors clashed with police and defied curfew to stay out in the streets. Businesses were shut and shots were fired at police, who have continued to struggle to control the situation, which was described as “absolute chaos” by the Minnesota governor, Tim Waltz, a Democrat.“Quite candidly, right now, we do not have the numbers,” Mr. he said at a news briefing. “We cannot arrest people when we’re trying to hold ground because of the sheer size, the dynamics and the wanton violence that’s coming out there.”In a rare move, the Pentagon is reported to be prepared to deploy several units of military police to Minneapolis if needed. Soldiers from Fort Bragg and Fort Drum, military facilities in North Carolina and New York, have been put on four-hour deployment notice, the Associated Press reported Saturday.In Atlanta, protestors targeted CNN world headquarters and threw projectiles at it and defaced the company sign in front. While a reporter was on air from inside the building a firecracker was thrown into the lobby where police officers stood in a cordon. A state of emergency has been declared in the city and National Guards have been instructed to stand by for deployment.Clashes with police and vandalization of police vehicles took place in Los Angeles and Houston. In New York, dozens of people were taken into custody and many police officers were injured in the clashes. And in Portland, Oregon, demonstrators stormed a government building and set fire to cubicles inside.Protests in some cities were about their own killed in police encounters. Demonstrators in Louisville, Kentucky, for instance, mourned the killing of Breanna Taylor, an Africa American woman, by the police in March. Similar protests have been planned for the weekend in Austin and Phoenix.The Washington Post reported that police use-of-force is the sixth leading cause of death for young men of color in the United States. And, according to a database compiled by the news publication about 1,000 people are shot and killed by police every year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/protests-rage-across-us-over-minneapolis-death-trump-warns-wh-demonstrators-of-vicious-dogs/story-5Si2znqtZavAtQ8kEOZ80H.html

30-05-2020||World||Why Trump’s China announcement leaves room to de-escalate tensions||President Donald Trump’s long-touted response to China for its crackdown on Hong Kong included a barrage of criticism but stopped short of fully escalating tensions between the two nations.While the U.S. president’s speech Friday was heated in rhetoric, it lacked specifics around measures that would directly impact Beijing. He announced the U.S. would begin the process of stripping some of Hong Kong’s privileged trade status without detailing how quickly any changes would take effect and how many exemptions would apply.The president also promised sanctions against Chinese and Hong Kong officials “directly or indirectly involved” in eroding Hong Kong’s autonomy but didn’t identify individuals. The administration hasn’t yet decided under what authority it would implement that action, according to a person familiar with a matter, who declined to be named because the deliberations are private.“Our actions will be strong. Our actions will be meaningful,” Trump said in the White House Rose Garden.U.S. stocks erased losses and traded little changed as Trump stopped short of implementing more draconian measures against China, with the S&P 500 Index rising 0.5% at the close in New York.The president said that the U.S. will terminate its relationship with the World Health Organization, which Trump has accused of being too deferential to China and of failing to provide accurate information about the spread of the coronavirus. He also said he would limit visas for certain Chinese students.Both those moves are tangential to China’s escalations in Hong Kong and don’t strike at Beijing to the degree that some in markets had feared earlier in the week. For instance, there was no unraveling of the phase-one trade deal signed between the world’s two biggest economies in January.Trump repeated a list of his grievances with China and punted tougher policy measures that his administration had discussed, including financial sanctions.His remarks also didn’t include mention of legislation passed by Congress this week that could sanction Chinese government officials over the treatment of Uighurs, who have been forcibly detained in internment camps in China’s Xinjiang region.“This binds the president to nothing with regards to China,” Derek Scissors, a China analyst at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. “With regards to a Hong Kong policy, it is a non-event. Nothing happened.”Hawks PushingThe Trump administration and China for weeks have been trading barbs over who’s to blame for the impact of the coronavirus pandemic in the U.S. and Republican lawmakers have been pushing Trump to hold the country accountable. More hawkish advisers wanted the president to take decisive action against Chinese Communist Party officials for alleged human rights violations in the city.Trump’s announcement came after China’s legislature this week approved a plan to draft legislation that Hong Kong democracy advocates say will curtail freedom of speech and undermine the island’s independent judiciary, and after Secretary of State Michael Pompeo decertified the former British colony’s autonomy under U.S. law.That certification determination, however, doesn’t mean the U.S. has to treat Hong Kong exactly like mainland China for purposes of tariffs, sales of sensitive technologies or visas. Instead, the administration has a wide spectrum of options for actions to take -- but most of them do little harm to Beijing and instead hurt not only Hong Kong but also the U.S.Hong Kong’s Secretary for Justice Teresa Cheng said it’s within the central government’s rights to pass national security laws since the city is part China, even though it operates under a separate administrative system.“In so far as the national security is concerned, as in any other country in the world, this is a matter that belongs to the central authorities, whether it is a unitary or federal state,” according to a government transcipt of her comments to the media. “Any other state that tries to use coercion or whatever means with a view to interfering with the sovereign right of a state to pass its own national security law is arguably infringing on the principle of non-intervention under public international law, and that is not acceptable.”The city’s security chief, John Lee, told the media Saturday that the government is looking into the possibilities for the proposed legislation, including whether it’s necessary to set up a special unit on national security, and how police and other enforcement bodies should work with the mainland, according to a transcipt posted on the government website.Relationship BottomTrump’s remarks omitted key details about what actions he’s taking, but his tone marked an escalation of hostile relations with China, said Jude Blanchette, China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “This further entrenches the view in Beijing that we haven’t found rock bottom yet in the relationship,” he said.The president said Beijing “unlawfully claimed territory in the Pacific Ocean” and “broke its word with the world on ensuring the autonomy of Hong Kong.”“The Chinese government has continuously violated its promises to us,” Trump said. “These plain facts cannot be overlooked or swept aside. The world is now suffering as a result of the malfeasance of the Chinese government,” he added, referring to the pandemic.Chinese officials earlier Friday called potential U.S. actions over Hong Kong “purely nonsense,” saying the matter was an internal affair and that essential freedoms in the city would remain intact.Read More: What Hong Kong Losing Its ‘Special Status’ Would Mean: QuickTakeBeijing urged the U.S. to stop its “frivolous political manipulation,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told reporters at a daily briefing, reiterating Beijing’s support for Hong Kong police in upholding the law. Chinese officials have indicated they may retaliate against U.S. firms over the president’s decisions.The U.S. plan is “gross interference” in China’s affairs and is “doomed to fail,” the People’s Daily, mouthpiece of the Communist Party, said in a commentary Saturday. Beijing would be firm in responding and would not be forced into making concessions on sovereignty or security, the newspaper said.Claudia Mo, a pro-democracy lawmaker in Hong Kong, said: “This looks like a new Cold War, and Hong Kong is being made a new Berlin -- we are caught right in the middle of it.”“China is not likely to budge,” she said in a texted message on Saturday. China “must have considered such consequences and decided it could take them. Beijing will retaliate, it’s just a matter of how and when.”Trump ramped up expectations for his announcement on China actions for several days this week. Even without many immediate actions outlined, the president used Friday’s announcement to laud his administration’s tough stance on Beijing with less than six months left before the presidential election.“This was an election speech,” Blanchette said. “This will be the tone and tempo until November.”(Adds Hong Kong official’s from 16th paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/why-trump-s-china-announcement-leaves-room-to-de-escalate-tensions/story-S4uD7EgfGfZEsAnoHFnfaI.html
30-05-2020||World||Russia records nearly 9,000 new coronavirus cases||Russia has recorded nearly 9,000 new cases of the coronavirus, roughly consistent with the increases reported over the past two weeks. The national coronavirus task force said Saturday that 4,555 Russians have died of Covid-19 and 396,575 infections have been confirmed overall. The relatively low mortality rate compared with other countries has prompted skepticism domestically and abroad. In a bid to dispel suspicions that authorities are trying to lower the death toll for political reasons, Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova explained Friday that Russia’s count contains only those confirmed to have died of the infection, but she also gave figures for people who tested positive for the virus but died of other causes. If all categories are counted as Covid-19 deaths, the nation’s total toll for April would stand at 2,713, or nearly 60 per cent more than the previously announced number.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-records-nearly-9-000-new-coronavirus-cases/story-duBTtuyLUmf6Uuzjw61hLO.html
30-05-2020||World||Trump WHO funding cut prompts criticism as virus spreads||President Donald Trump’s announcement he was cutting US funding for the World Health Organization prompted criticism Saturday, as spiking infection rates in India and elsewhere served as a reminder the global pandemic is far from contained.Trump on Friday charged that the WHO didn’t respond adequately to the pandemic, accusing the U.N. agency of being under China’s “total control.”The WHO wouldn’t comment on the announcement but South African Health Minister Zweli Mkhize called it an “unfortunate” turn of events.“Certainly, when faced with a serious pandemic, you want all nations in the world to be particularly focused ... on one common enemy,” he told reporters.The U.S. is the largest source of financial support for the WHO, and its exit is expected to significantly weaken the organization. Trump said the U.S. would be “redirecting” the money to “other worldwide and deserving urgent global public health needs,” without providing specifics.In China, where the virus outbreak began, only four new confirmed cases were reported Saturday, all brought from outside the country, and no new deaths. Just 63 people remained in treatment.After judging the situation there now safe, a chartered flight carrying 200 German managers back to their jobs landed in Tianijin, a port city just east of Beijing. A flight carrying another 200 was due in Shanghai on Thursday.“I’m really happy that business is starting again,” said Karin Wasowski, a Volkswagen employee, before boarding the flight in Frankfurt. “I’ve been working from a home office but that is, of course, something completely different to being there.”More than 5,200 German companies operate in China, employing more than 1 million people.“This is an important step to reconnect China’s and Germany’s economies,” said Jens Hildebrandt, executive director of the German Chamber of Commerce in North China, which helped organize the flights. “It is our common interest to contribute in helping the economy return to normalcy and pre-virus levels.”Close to 6 million coronavirus infections have been reported worldwide, with more than 365,000 deaths and almost 2.5 million recoveries, according to a tally kept by Johns Hopkins University. The true dimensions are widely believed to be significantly greater, with experts saying many victims died without ever being tested.As some countries have effectively lowered the rate of infections, they have been moving ahead with relaxing restrictions but are keeping a very close eye on developments.In South Korea, credited with one of the most successful programs to fight the pandemic, there were 39 new cases reported Saturday, most of them in the densely populated Seoul metropolitan area where officials have linked the infections to warehouse workers. Authorities have so far maintained the phased reopening of schools in the hope that the recent transmissions could be contained quickly.India registered another record single day jump of 7,964 cases and 265 deaths, a day before it was to end its 2-month-old lockdown.That put the country’s total cases at 173,763 with 4,971 deaths and 82,369 recoveries, according to the Health Ministry.Still, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, said in an open letter that India was on the path to “victory” in its battle against the virus and would “an example in economic revival,” while asking his countrymen to show “firm resolve.”Russia recorded nearly 9,000 new cases overnight, around the daily level it has been at over the past two weeks as the virus continues to spread.The national coronavirus task force said Saturday that 4,555 Russians have died of COVID-19, and 396,575 infections have been recorded. The relatively low mortality rate compared with other countries has prompted skepticism domestically and abroad.U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres announced two peacekeepers serving in Mali had died from the virus. There have been 137 confirmed cases of COVID-19 among peacekeepers, the majority in Mali, but these were the first deaths.The U.S. has been worst hit by the outbreak, with more than 1.7 million cases and almost 103,000 deaths.Cities and states are under increasing pressure to reopen, however, especially for service industries that had seen customer numbers evaporate. The latest job-loss figures from the U.S. Labor Department brought to 41 million the running total of Americans who have filed for unemployment since shutdowns took hold in mid-March.But there have been worrying signs that as restrictions are eased, people have not been adhering to social distancing guidelines meant to help prevent the spread of the virus.On Friday, health officials in Missouri said that they were seeking to “inform mass numbers of unknown people” after a person who attended crowded pool parties over Memorial Day weekend at the state’s popular Lake of the Ozarks tested positive for COVID-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-who-funding-cut-prompts-criticism-as-virus-spreads/story-aEwC32U544V2uONrkJhTQP.html
30-05-2020||World||England easing Covid-19 lockdown too soon, scientific advisers warn||England risks losing control of the coronavirus pandemic again because it is starting to lift its lockdown without a fully operational track and trace programme in place, three senior scientific advisers warned on Saturday. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said England’s lockdown measures will be eased cautiously from Monday, aided by a track and trace system that launched on Thursday.The advisers warned, however, that the system was not yet in full operation and risked being overwhelmed by the around 8,000 new infections that are still occurring every day outside of hospitals and care homes.John Edmunds, from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and a member of Britain’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), said the government was taking a risk. “Track and trace was only launched the day before yesterday, so we can’t be sure that that is working effectively yet and yet we’re going ahead and making these changes anyway,” he told Sky News. “I think that that is rather dangerous.” Edmunds’ comments were echoed by two other SAGE members: Peter Horby, also the chairman of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (NERVTAG), and Jeremy Farrar, the director of the Wellcome Trust.One of the slowest countries to lock down, Britain is now one of the worst-hit by the pandemic, with more than 48,000 deaths and more than 270,000 people testing positive.To try to contain the virus while also allowing the econony to recover, the test and trace system will ask contacts of people who test positive to self-isolate for 14 days, even if they have no symptoms. An app is not yet ready for the scheme. Horby of the University of Oxford said there was still too much uncertainty about what would happen to the virus’ reproduction rate -- commonly known as R -- if schools reopen and other activities resume.He added that the track, trace and isolate system was not expected to be fully operational - with local teams working to stamp out clusters of cases - until the end of June.“Returning to a situation where we’ve lost control again is far worse than a week or two of social measures,” he told BBC Radio.Government officials have repeatedly said they are following “the science” as they respond to the pandemic, but Edmunds said the decision to ease the lockdown from Monday was political.“My frustration has been recently at least that they’re pretending that they’re not making a decision, that in fact it’s us who are making the decision, and that’s not really the case,” he said. “They have to make the decision and clearly they have.”The prime minister’s office said it had at all times been informed by the data and evidence. “This package of measures has been carefully designed so we can ease the burdens of lockdown while expecting to keep R below one.”The devolved governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are responsible for their own public health policy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/england-easing-covid-19-lockdown-too-soon-scientific-advisers-warn/story-iuZlhPHJrwBnTVGJBxzg1K.html

The Justice Department in a bombshell early this month moved to dismiss the charge Flynn had already pleaded guilty to, following public urging by Trump and his allies.The transcript shows a key discussion item between Flynn and Kislyak was a move by the administration of President Barack Obama to penalize Russia in response to findings by US spy agencies that Moscow interfered in the 2016 US presidential election through hacking and propaganda operations.“I know you have to have some sort of action - to, to only make it reciprocal. Make it reciprocal,” Flynn said, according to the transcript. “Don’t - don’t make it - don’t go any further than you have to,” Flynn added. “Because I don’t want us to get into something that has to escalate, on a, you know, on a tit for tat. You follow me, Ambassador?”The transcript is dated Dec. 29, 2016 - the day the Obama administration announced it was expelling 35 alleged Russian intelligence operatives from the United States.Trump has long bristled at US intelligence agencies’ assessment that Russia interfered in the 2016 election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-ex-adviser-flynn-asked-russia-to-avoid-tit-for-tat-new-transcript-shows/story-iA4mIzWrN6alFsWCJkYWSO.html
30-05-2020||World||Two Indian-origin men jailed for £2.4 million money laundering||Two Indian-origin men have been jailed for a total of 12 years and nine months following an international £2.4 million money-laundering operation and attempt to launder a further £1.6 million, Scotland Yard said on Saturday. Vijaya Kumar Krishnasamy, 32, and Chandrasekar Nallayan, 44, were sentenced by the Croydon Crown Court on Friday for money laundering and fraud offences around the world.The police said they received a report in 2018 from Barclays Bank that several IP addresses were repeatedly accessing multiple business accounts suspected of being utilised for money laundering. The IP addresses were traced to properties in the Croydon area.On May 2, 2019, a search warrant was executed at one of these addresses and Krishnasamy was arrested. A search revealed hundreds of pages of documents relating to dozens of suspicious businesses and hundreds of bank accounts.His mobile phone contained thousands of images of him accessing various suspect accounts online or withdrawing cash from ATMs. From the evidence on Krishnasamy’s mobile phone, Nallayan was identified as another suspect.The court was told that he was directing Krishnasamy where to transfer the criminal funds. Detectives discovered he owned or controlled ‘mule’ accounts that were being used to funnel the money through.‘Mule’ bank accounts are those controlled by fraudsters instead of their legitimate holders. The accounts are sourced from dishonest people who were prepared to ‘sell on’ their own bank accounts for a fee whilst knowing that they would be used for fraud.In total, 24 companies that were victim to the scam were identified from around the world.They would receive a fraudulent email claiming to be from their client, who had previously invoiced them, informing them about a change of their bank account details.The company, believing they were paying their genuine clients, transferred money to the suspect bank account. They would not know that they had been defrauded until their real client started chasing the payment.By that time, the majority of money in these suspected ‘mule’ business accounts was transferred out of the UK and could not be recovered. Krishnasamy entered a guilty plea, admitting to having access to ‘mule’ accounts via online banking, monitoring these accounts, and transferring funds as directed. He knew that the funds were the proceeds of crime.Nallayan pleaded not guilty to conspiring to conceal, disguise, convert, transfer or remove criminal property, but was convicted for all offences after a trial in the Croydon Crown Court.Detective constable Milena Bingley said: “This shameless pair have caused untold distress and worry to their victims. This case shows that those responsible for money laundering will be tracked down and face up to their crimes”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/two-indian-origin-men-jailed-for-2-4-million-money-laundering/story-rh9s2tf3Y54LuDsthRTyNM.html
30-05-2020||World||In unusual move, US embassies in Africa speak up on Floyd||As Minneapolis burns over the police killing of George Floyd and shock and disappointment in Africa grow, some US embassies on the continent have taken the unusual step of issuing critical statements, saying no one is above the law.The statements came as the head of the African Union Commission, Moussa Faki Mahamat, condemned the “murder” of Floyd and said Friday the continental body rejects the “continuing discriminatory practices against black citizens of the USA.”Africa has not seen the kind of protests over Floyd’s killing that have erupted across the United States, but many Africans have expressed disgust and dismay, openly wondering when the US will ever get it right.“WTF? ‘When the looting starts the shooting starts’?” tweeted political cartoonist Patrick Gathara in Kenya, which has its own troubles with police brutality. He, like many, was aghast at the tweet by President Donald Trump, flagged by Twitter as violating rules against “glorifying violence,” that the president later said had been misconstrued.Mindful of America’s image on a continent where China’s influence has grown and where many have felt a distinct lack of interest from the Trump administration in Africa, some US diplomats have tried to control the damage.The ambassador to Congo, Mike Hammer, highlighted a tweet from a local media entrepreneur who addressed him saying, “Dear ambassador, your country is shameful. Proud America, which went through everything from segregation to the election of Barack Obama, still hasn’t conquered the demons of racism. How many black people must be killed by white police officers before authorities react seriously?”The ambassador’s response, in French: “I am profoundly troubled by the tragic death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. The Justice Department is conducting a full criminal investigation as a top priority. Security forces around the world should be held accountable. No one is above the law.”Similar statements were tweeted by the US embassies in Kenya and Uganda, while the embassies in Tanzania and Kenya tweeted a joint statement from the Department of Justice office in Minnesota on the investigation.African officials also were publicly outspoken last month over racism in China, when Africans complained of being evicted and mistreated in the city of Guangzhou amid the Covid-19 pandemic.At the time, the US was quick to join in, with the embassy in Beijing issuing a critical security alert titled “Discrimination against African-Americans in Guangzhou” and noting actions against people thought to be African or have African contacts.Now the Africa-facing version of the state-run China Daily newspaper is tweeting footage from Minneapolis with the hashtags #GeorgeFloydWasMurdered and #BlackLivesMatter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-unusual-move-us-embassies-in-africa-speak-up-on-floyd/story-cfZ890gnCc9CL2aCaYLhwL.html

Spahn described Trump’s latest move as “a disappointing backlash for International Health.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-says-trump-split-from-who-will-harm-global-health/story-q4cjQXLAqS93yr3o9pW8DP.html

Brazil could soon surpass France, which has seen 28,714 deaths.Brazil is second in the number of confirmed cases, though trailing far behind the United States which has 1.7 million infections.Brazil has seen 131.2 coronavirus deaths per one million people -- compared to more than 300 in the United States and 580 in Spain -- but the pandemic has yet to peak in the South American country.“There is no way to foresee” when the outbreak will peak, the Ministry of Health said, and experts say the number of cases in Brazil could be 15 times higher than the confirmed figure because there has been no widespread testing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-covid-19-death-toll-hits-27-878-surpassing-hard-hit-spain/story-bkThSnn2GIVmu62wXgpaXI.html
30-05-2020||World||Nepal’s parties show rare unity on border dispute: Report||While Nepal’s latest border dispute with India has strained relations between South Asian neighbors with centuries-old historical, cultural and economic ties, it also has brought the tiny Himalayan nation’s bickering political parties together in a rare show of unity.The opposition Nepali Congress party has voiced support for the government in its row with India over its inauguration of a Himalayan link road built in a disputed region that lies at a strategic three-way junction with Tibet and China.In response, the government of Prime Minister Khadga Prasad Sharma Oli issued a new political map of the country that showed the disputed territory within its borders, a move that was overwhelmingly supported by Nepal’s opposition and civil society.”It is just not the political parties but the whole population that is backing the government on the issue,” said Puranjan Acharya, an independent analyst.The 80-kilometer (50-mile) road, inaugurated by Indian Defense Minister Rajnath Singh earlier this month, cuts through the Lipu Lekh Himalayan pass, which is considered one of the shortest and most feasible trade routes between India and China.Nepal fiercely contested the inauguration of the road and viewed the alleged incursions as a stark example of bullying by its much larger neighbor, triggering a fresh dispute over the strategically important territory.Nepal, which was never under colonial rule, has long claimed the areas of Limpiyadhura, Kalapani and Lipu Lekh in accordance with the 1816 Sugauli treaty with the British Raj, although these areas have remained in control of Indian troops since India fought a war with China in 1962.The dispute over the territory, however, brought a new wedge in relations between the two South Asian nations, leading to an exchange of strong-worded statements and remarks from both sides.India called Nepal’s move a unilateral act that is not based on historical facts, and said it was contrary to the bilateral understanding to resolve the outstanding boundary issues through dialogue.As anger grows on both sides, analysts say the two countries have no choice but to hold talks to try to resolve their differences.“As an independent country, Nepal has few options, but the best one is to sit down” and discuss the issue with India, said Dhurba Adhikary, an independent analyst.This is not the first time there have been differences between Nepal and India.India imposed an economic blockade in 1989 and again stopped the exports of oil, medicines and food to Nepal in 2015, causing severe shortages for months in Nepal, which at the time was recovering from a devastating earthquake. India had supported an ethnic group in Nepal that was demanding more territory.

China has largely banned all foreigners from entering China because of the coronavirus outbreak.“This is an important step to reconnect China’s and Germany’s economies,” Jens Hildebrandt, executive director of the German Chamber of Commerce in North China, was quoted as saying in a news release. “It is our common interest to contribute in helping the economy return to normalcy and pre-virus levels.” More than 5,200 German companies operate in China, employing more than 1 million people. “We know there is a huge demand in the German business community to get more foreign employees back to China,” Hildebrandt was quoted as saying.The first flight with 200 passengers was due to arrive shortly before noon on Saturday in Tianjin, a port city just east of the capital Beijing. Another flight to Shanghai. The second flight was expected to arrive in Shanghai around midday on Thursday, June 4.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/400-german-managers-workers-returning-to-china/story-zeISXzwIRk9Yoj5jCzpLNJ.html
30-05-2020||World||Elections for 5 non-permanent members of UNSC in June; India assured of seat||The UN General Assembly has decided to hold elections for the five non-permanent members of the Security Council next month under the new voting arrangements due to the Covid-19 restrictions, with India assured a win being the sole contender for the Asia Pacific seat. The 193-member General Assembly adopted the decision on Friday titled ‘Procedure for holding elections by secret ballot without a plenary meeting during the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic’. According to the decision, the elections of non-permanent members to the Security Council and the election of members to the Economic and Social Council will be held simultaneously in June 2020 without a plenary meeting. Election for the five non-permanent members of the 15-nation council for the 2021-22 term was originally scheduled on June 17. India is a candidate for a non-permanent seat and its victory is assured as it is the sole candidate vying for the lone seat from the Asia Pacific grouping. New Delhi’s candidature was unanimously endorsed in June last year by the 55 members of the Asia-Pacific grouping, including China and Pakistan. From India’s perspective, any change in the voting method will not impact its chances. The term is to start in January 2021. Traditionally, the UNSC elections are held in the General Assembly hall with each of the 193 member states casting its vote in a secret ballot. Now, large in-person meetings at the world body’s headquarters stand postponed till the end of June due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Under the new voting arrangement, President of the General Assembly Tijjani Muhammad-Bande will circulate a letter to all Member States at least 10 working days prior to the first round of the secret balloting, informing them of the date on which the elections will be held, the number of vacant seats, the venue where ballots may be cast and other logistical details. On the day of the elections, the voter will be required to visit the designated venue during a specific time slot to cast its ballots. Only ballots cast in the ballot boxes at the designated venues will be accepted and no ballots would be accepted after the last time slot has expired. If the total number of ballot papers cast in all the ballot boxes do not amount to at least a majority of the members of the Assembly, the President would circulate a letter to all Member States indicating a new date and time for the elections. The General Assembly President will circulate a letter to all Member States informing them of the results once the voting is complete and the ballots counted. Canada, Ireland and Norway are vying for two seats in the Western Europe and other countries category. Mexico is the only candidate for the one Latin America and Caribbean seat and Kenya and Djibouti will contest the seat available for the African group. Previously, India has been elected as a non-permanent member of the Council for the years 1950—1951, 1967—1968, 1972—1973, 1977—1978, 1984—1985, 1991—1992 and most recently in 2011—2012. India has been at the forefront of the years-long efforts to reform the Security Council, saying it rightly deserves a place as a permanent member of the Council which in its current form does not represent the geo-political realities of the 21st Century. Each year the General Assembly elects five non-permanent members (out of 10 in total) for a two-year term. The 10 non-permanent seats are distributed on a regional basis - five for African and Asian States; one for Eastern European States; two for the Latin American and Caribbean States; and two for Western European and other States. The decision to hold the UNSC elections was adopted through a silence procedure, under which if no Member State raises any objections to the draft within a specified time period, the president of the General Assembly will circulate a letter confirming adoption of the text.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/elections-for-5-non-permanent-members-of-unsc-in-june-india-assured-of-seat/story-gvIAXPVxfBiCiF9ARTKjEP.html

It means serious question marks not just about Hong Kong’s future as a free society but also about Hong Kong’s ability to continue as probably the premier international financial hub in Asia,” Patten said in an interview.“A lot of people will try to leave Hong Kong,” Patten said, adding that he feared capital would also flow out of the territory which Britain handed back to China in 1997.The West, he said, should stop being naive about Xi.“We have long since passed the stage where, without wanting another Cold War, we have to react to the fact Xi seems to want one himself, seems to want to be able to bully his way to whatever he thinks China wants,” Patten said.Patten, now 76, watched as the British flag was lowered over Hong Kong when the colony was handed back to China in 1997 after more than 150 years of British rule - imposed after Britain defeated China in the First Opium War. Hong Kong’s autonomy was guaranteed under the “one country, two systems” agreement enshrined in the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration signed by then Chinese Premier Zhao Ziyang and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-nervous-xi-risks-new-cold-war-ex-hong-kong-governor-says/story-sL5ZY0UI8o1PKsDWiwM2iN.html
30-05-2020||World||Suspects in UK migrant truck tragedy charged in France||Thirteen suspects arrested by French police over the deaths of 39 Vietnamese migrants in a refrigerated lorry in Britain have been charged with people trafficking, a judicial source said Saturday.Six of the group -- mainly Vietnamese and French nationals -- were held on Tuesday in the Paris region and have also been charged with manslaughter after the alleged key figure in a ring of smugglers was caught in Germany.Thirteen people were also arrested in Belgium the same day in an international police operation.The migrants -- 31 men and eight women -- were found dead in the truck in an industrial zone east of London in October 2019.The driver of the lorry has already admitted manslaughter but Tuesday’s swoop targeted the smugglers suspected of organising the migrants’ journey from Asia.The suspect arrested in Germany’s Upper Rhine region is a 29-year-old man nicknamed “The Bald Duke,” sources told AFP.“He could be the head of the network on the French side,” a source close to the investigation said.But the man’s nationality was not revealed.The 13 indicted in France also face charges of membership of a criminal organisation and all but one was put in custody.Eleven of the 13 suspects in Belgium have already been charged by a judge in Bruges with people trafficking, membership of a criminal organisation and fraud, according to Belgian prosecutorsThe investigation found that the migrants who died were loaded into the truck in northern France, and that the network continued to operate even after the tragedy, charging up to 20,000 euros to cross from France to Britain.Investigation sources told AFP the group caught in France was believed to have housed the migrants and then sent them from Paris to the north by taxi.The driver of the lorry, Maurice Robinson from Northern Ireland, last month pleaded guilty to manslaughter over the 39 deaths.Four other men are on trial in London over the tragedy, while another man, Ronan Hughes, is facing extradition from Ireland to Britain on 39 counts of manslaughter and one of conspiracy to commit unlawful immigration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/suspects-in-uk-migrant-truck-tragedy-charged-in-france/story-FSHEYJ84g1ZIztVEOLRVBJ.html

It added that the chancellor would continue to monitor the coronavirus situation in case things change.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/german-chancellor-angela-merkel-won-t-attend-g7-summit-in-person-if-us-goes-ahead/story-BKkGborHOuVrQXQKA4X1mL.html

More than 100 vaccines for the virus are being developed globally, but only a handful have made it to the crucial and final human clinical trial stage, with Chinese scientists leading the way.In total, five vaccines developed by Chinese companies are being tested on humans, the most in any country. Beijing has mobilized its health authorities, drug regulators and research institutes to work around the clock with local companies to come up with the world’s first successful one for Covid-19.President Xi Jinping has promised to share any successful vaccine globally, but Chinese companies still face challenges. Phase III testing needs to be done in a place where the coronavirus is still spreading rapidly, and China’s cases have dwindled to a handful each day. Also, an effective vaccine needs massive production capabilities in order to meet global distribution demands.The vaccine candidate from Beijing Institute of Biological Products and China National Biotec Group employs a killed version of the novel coronavirus that can still trigger an immune response. Such inactivated vaccines have been developed for many years to protect populations from diseases including polio and hepatitis.While inactivated vaccines may be slower to develop initially, their familiar path to mass production might allow them to overtake shots made by newer, cutting-edge approaches.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-covid-19-vaccine-expected-to-begin-mass-output-this-year/story-GQnYfwHnILe17GURVKjITI.html
30-05-2020||World||US ‘very saddened’ by what happened to the relationship with China: Trump||President Donald Trump has said the US is “very saddened” by what happened to its relationship with China, hours after he announced a series of decisions against it and blamed the Chinese government’s “malfeasance” for the death and devastation caused by the Covid-19 pandemic worldwide. Amid escalating bilateral tensions over the coronavirus pandemic, trade issues and Beijing’s new controversial security law in Hong Kong, Trump announced a series of decisions including issuing a proclamation to deny the entry to certain Chinese nationals and tightening of regulations against Chinese investments in America.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageTrump also terminated the US’ relationship with the World Health Organisation, accusing the UN’s health body of misguiding the world on the coronavirus and siding with China on this issue.“We’re talking about doing a lot of things and we’re very, very saddened by what happened to our relationship with China. They should have never allowed this to happen. They could have stopped it at the source. We asked them to come in and help them, and they didn’t want help from anybody, even the World Health Organization,” he told reporters at the White House on Friday, referring to the spread of the virus that has killed over one lakh people in America alone.Trump said that China contained the virus within its own territory but did not stop it from spreading around the world.“We are certainly not happy with what happened with respect to China. They have a virus that started and when it got out of control, perhaps, I assume that’s what happened, it got out of control, whichever way and they stopped it from going to China, but they didn’t stop it from going to the rest of the world. So nobody likes that. That was not good,” Trump said. “Countless lives have been taken and profound economic hardship has been inflicted all around the globe,” Trump said.According to the Johns Hopkins University data, the deadly disease has infected nearly 6 million people and claimed over 364,000 lives worldwide.The US is the worst-affected country in the world with over 1.7 million confirmed Covid-19 cases and more than 102,000 deaths.“They did not do a good job. So, I don’t know if it was incompetence or it was done for some other reason, but I know that I didn’t see anything in Beijing and I didn’t see anything in other Chinese cities, but I did see them in New York and London, in Paris. We saw them in Spain and we saw them in Italy. We saw that the enemy, the invisible enemy come out,” he said. Led by the US, several countries in the world have blamed China for the spread of coronavirus and its failure to provide timely information about the disease, leading to the death of over three lakh people and causing an unprecedented economic crisis.Trump has been pressing China to agree for an inquiry into the origin of the virus, including the allegation that it emerged from a bio-lab in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.“The world is now suffering as a result of the malfeasance of the Chinese government,” he said.He added that China had “instigated a global pandemic that has cost over 100,000 American lives”. The president accused China of pressurising the WHO to “mislead the world” about the virus. However, China has rejected all US allegations of a cover up regarding the Covid-19 outbreak.On asked if this was the start of the Cold War between the US and China, he said, “And all over the world, 186 countries, and probably more than that now. And they stopped it in China, but they didn’t stop it going to Europe and the United States and the rest of the world. So what’s that all about? And we have to do a very strong study and figure that out.”  “They wanted to go in, and they were delayed. But we asked to go in very specifically, and they didn’t want any help. They didn’t need any help, and then it got out of control in some form. But it didn’t seem to get out of control when it came to going to other parts of China because it didn’t go very far, but it did come to the United States. It did come to Europe. It went all over the world,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-very-saddened-by-what-happened-to-the-relationship-with-china-trump/story-VqXU6pv7PoBBEbiDalIg3I.html
30-05-2020||World||New York City expected to reopen on June 8: Cuomo||New York City is “on track” to enter phase one of reopening on June 8, New York Governor Cuomo said on Friday as he announced that five upstate regions will now transition to phase two which includes businesses like barber shops and hair salons.The most populous US city, which has become the epicenter of the country’s coronavirus pandemic, was on track to meet the metrics for a safe reopening, Cuomo said. “We are on track to open on June 8,” Cuomo told a daily briefing but warned that “reopening does not mean we’re going back to the way things were.”The first phase of reopening would allow non-essential construction and manufacturing to resume, and non-essential retail stores to offer curbside pick-up. Cuomo said he expected some 400,000 New Yorkers to be able to return to their workplaces starting June 8, and said the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) was working on a plan to make the city’s mass transit system safe for commuters.“I understand why people would be anxious about taking public transit,” Cuomo said. “The public transit system will be safe.”New York City is the only one of the state’s 10 regions that has not met the seven health benchmarks for reopening set by state authorities. The Finger Lakes, Mohawk Valley, Southern Tier, North Country and Central New York are the five regions cleared to enter phase two and allow services like barber shops and in-store shopping to resume, with restrictions like 50% occupancy and face coverings.Cuomo also recommended that professionals in the phase two industries get tested before operations resume.“That’s not a mandate that’s a recommendation, and we recommend to customers to ask the barber or professional in the hair salon if they had a test before you use their services,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-city-expected-to-reopen-on-june-8-cuomo/story-HcuuO1Bl3GeRauE42ImSgP.html
30-05-2020||World||2020 could be the hottest year since records began, experts warn||The year 2020 has been marked by astounding events globally, from nearly the entire planet gripped in the clutches of Covid-19 disease, super cyclone Amphan ravaging the Bengal coast, locust attack in parts of India and other countries to the scorching heatwave. Scientists and experts believe that when it comes to the rapid rise in temperature this summer season, this year could be the hottest. A report by HT’s Hindi language publication Hindustan states the same citing a team of experts at the International Center for Climate Change and Development.According to the report, the worst heat will affect many countries falling in the northern hemisphere which include nations like India and Bangladesh. It also predicted heatwave conditions to intensify in the coming weeks. Earlier this month, India and Bangladesh bore the brunt of super cyclone Amphan which caused havoc in states like Odisha and West Bengal in India.This is not the first time when scientists anticipated a record spike in temperature for 2020. Earlier this year, a team of meteorologists said this year could be on course to be the hottest since measurements began. As per a report by leading British daily The Guardian, experts said there is a 50% to 75% chance for 2020 to break the record in terms of heat that was set four years ago.As per the ‘2020 global annual temperature ranking outlook’ by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, there is over 74% chance for this year to be the warmest ever since the measurements began. Parts of north India and Vidarbha region, in the past week, witnessed sweltering heat and a spell of heatwave with temperatures shooting up to 46 degrees Celsius in places like Sonegaon, Maharashtra and Churu in Rajasthan. Delhi received a brief relief from excruciating heat after a spell of rainfall on Friday. The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) had said in its weekly forecast that rain and thunderstorm will continue to lash Delhi and nearby areas in northern India thereby giving relief to people from the scorching heat. The IMD said that heatwave has abated from most parts of the country, and relief from extreme heat will be there from May 30 to June 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/experts-warn-2020-could-be-the-hottest-year-since-records-began/story-HOXcRXipXMp6VUwmHEe4RJ.html
30-05-2020||World||Trump walks back his incendiary Minneapolis ‘thugs’ post||President Donald Trump has tried to walk back his post-midnight “thugs” tweet about Minneapolis protesters that added to outrage over the police killing of a black man.Trump’s repeated condemnation of the killing and outreach to the man’s family was a marked change in tone from his earlier comments that also invoked a civil-rights-era phrase fraught with racist overtones.“When the looting starts, the shooting starts,” Trump had written in a tweet that was quickly flagged by Twitter as violating rules against “glorifying violence.” Trump later said his comments had been misconstrued. “Frankly it means when there’s looting, people get shot and they die,” he said.Trump’s explanation did little to satisfy hundreds of protesters who gathered outside the White House into early Saturday, shouting “No justice, no peace” as well as an obscene chant directed at the president.Trump’s whiplash comments came after protesters torched a Minneapolis police station on Thursday night, following three days of searing demonstrations over the death of George Floyd, who was captured on video pleading for air as a white police officer knelt on his neck for over eight minutes.And they underscored Trump’s complicated relationship with race as he tries to maintain a law-and-order mantle while looking to appeal to black voters during an election year. They also highlighted his refusal to avoid controversy or cede the spotlight even as the battered nation tries to make sense of another killing and reels over the mounting Covid-19 death toll.Trump, in his tweets, borrowed a phrase once used by former Miami Police Chief Walter Headley in a 1967 speech outlining his department’s efforts to “combat young hoodlums who have taken advantage of the civil rights campaign.” In the speech, Headley said his department had been successful “because I’ve let the word filter down that when the looting starts, the shooting starts.”“We don’t mind being accused of police brutality,” he said in the same speech, according to news reports from the time.Trump, after hours of backlash, said Friday evening that he was unaware of the origins of the phrase. “But I’ve heard it for a long time, as most people have. And frankly it means when there’s looting, people get shot and they die,” he said.Trump also revealed that he had been in touch with Floyd’s family as he continued to denounce the circumstances of the man’s killing, which he called “a terrible insult to police and to policemen.”“I just expressed my sorrow,” Trump told reporters. “He was in tremendous pain, obviously, and couldn’t breathe. And it was very obvious to anybody that watched it.”Still, Trump called on protesters to keep their demonstrations peaceful.“The family of George is entitled to justice, and the people of Minnesota are entitled to live in safety,” he said. “Law and order will prevail.”Criticism of the Trump’s tweet had been swift, with his presumptive Democratic presidential rival Joe Biden saying it was “no time for incendiary tweets, no time to incite violence.”“It’s not helpful,” said Minnesota’s Democratic Gov. Tim Walz. “Anything we do to add fuel to that fire is really, really challenging.”Rep. Emmanuel Cleaver, D-Mo., said that, as the country passed the grim milestone of more than 100,000 COVID-19 deaths, Trump had missed a chance to help the public cope with “two viruses: One is the coronavirus and the other is the virus of racial animus.”Trump has been accused of stoking racial tensions and exploiting divisions for personal gain since long before he ran for president, beginning with the full-page ads he ran in 1989 calling for the death penalty for the Central Park Five, five young men of color who were wrongly convicted of assaulting a white jogger.Trump — who rarely holds his tongue — has been silent in the face of a long list of high-profile killings by police of black men, including Eric Garner, who was placed in a chokehold and whose dying words, “I can’t breathe,” became a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement. (Trump has instead invoked those words on several occasions to mock political rivals, even bringing his hands to his neck for dramatic effect.)He spent years railing against NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick and other players for kneeling during the National Anthem to protest racial injustice and police brutality. And in one speech he appeared to advocate rougher treatment of people in custody, speaking dismissively of the police practice of shielding the heads of handcuffed suspects as they are being placed in patrol cars.At the same time, Trump and his campaign have tried to make inroads with black Americans, particularly after Biden suggested last week that black voters who support Trump “ain’t black.” A bedrock of the Democratic base, black Americans are unlikely to embrace Trump en masse, but his campaign believes even a marginal shift could make a difference — and send a message to white voters uneasy about the president’s charged rhetoric.Meanwhile, the unrest complicates the Trump campaign’s plans for Minnesota, one of the key swing states he hopes to win in November.Twitter’s decision to flag Trump’s tweet — the second time it has acted this week — came a day after he signed an executive order challenging the social media giant’s protections against lawsuits as he accuses it of stifling conservative voices. The warning label prevented the tweet from being shared or liked, though it could still be viewed by users. The White House, trying to skirt the blockage, reposted the message on its own official Twitter account Friday morning. Twitter quickly flagged that tweet, too, accusing the White House of promoting violence.Supporters of the president balked at the move.Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale accused the media, Biden and other Democrats of “purposefully misrepresenting what the President had said, and showing once again that they are incapable of resisting their base impulse of dividing Americans, solely for the purpose of political gain, ratings, and cable news profit.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-walks-back-his-incendiary-minneapolis-thugs-post/story-1ZBiecM7lVkospSK5DdXVO.html
30-05-2020||World||Pentagon puts military police on alert to go to Minneapolis||As unrest spread across dozens of American cities on Friday, the Pentagon took the rare step of ordering the Army to put several active-duty US military police units on the ready to deploy to Minneapolis, where the police killing of George Floyd sparked the widespread protests.Soldiers from Fort Bragg in North Carolina and Fort Drum in New York have been ordered to be ready to deploy within four hours if called, according to three people with direct knowledge of the orders. Soldiers in Fort Carson, in Colorado, and Fort Riley in Kansas have been told to be ready within 24 hours. The people did not want their names used because they were not authorized to discuss the preparations.The get-ready orders were sent verbally on Friday, after President Donald Trump asked Defense Secretary Mark Esper for military options to help quell the unrest in Minneapolis after protests descended into looting and arson in some parts of the city.Trump made the request on a phone call from the Oval Office on Thursday night that included Esper, National Security Advisor Robert O’ Brien and several others. The president asked Esper for rapid deployment options if the Minneapolis protests continued to spiral out of control, according to one of the people, senior Pentagon official who was on the call.“When the White House asks for options, someone opens the drawer and pulls them out so to speak,” the official said.The person said the military units would be deployed under the Insurrection Act of 1807, which was last used in 1992 during the riots in Los Angeles that followed the Rodney King trial.“If this is where the president is headed response-wise, it would represent a significant escalation and a determination that the various state and local authorities are not up to the task of responding to the growing unrest,” Brad Moss, a Washington DC-based attorney, who specializes in national security.Members of the police units were on a 30-minute recall alert early Saturday, meaning they would have to return to their bases inside that time limit in preparation for deployment to Minneapolis inside of four hours. Units at Fort Drum are slated to head to Minneapolis first, according to the three people, including two Defence Department officials. Roughly 800 US soldiers would deploy to the city if called.Protests erupted in Minneapolis this week after video emerged showing a police officer kneeling on Floyd’s neck. Floyd later died of his injuries and the officer, Derek Chauvin, was arrested and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter on Friday.The protests turned violent and on Thursday rioters torched the Minneapolis Third Police Precinct near where Floyd was arrested. Mayor Jacob Frey ordered a citywide curfew at 8 pm beginning on Friday.The unrest has since spread across the country, with protests, some violent, erupting in cities including Washington DC, Atlanta, Phoenix, Denver and Los Angelas.Minnesota Governor Tim Walz ordered 500 of his National Guard troops into Minneapolis, St Paul, and surrounding communities.But a Pentagon spokesman said Walz did not ask for the Army to be deployed to his state.“The Department has been in touch with the Governor and there is no request for Title 10 forces to support the Minnesota National Guard or state law enforcement.” Title 10 is the US law that governs the armed forces, and would authorise active duty military to operate within the US.Alyssa Farah, the White House director of strategic communications said the deployment of active-duty military police is untrue.“False: off the record - title 10 not under discussion,” said Farah in an email response. No off-record agreement was negotiated with The Associated Press.The 16th Military Police Brigade forwarded the AP’s questions to the Defence Department.The three officials with direct knowledge of the potential deployment say the orders are on a classified system, known as the Secret Internet Protocol Router or SIPR for short.Active-duty forces are normally prohibited from acting as a domestic law enforcement agency. But the Insurrection Act offers an exception.“The Insurrection Act would allow the military to take up a policing authority it otherwise would not be allowed to do, enforcing state and federal laws,” said Stephen Vladeck, a University of Texas School of Law professor who specialises in constitutional and national security law.The statute “is deliberately vague” when it comes to the instances in which the Insurrection Act could be used, he said. The state’s governor could ask President Donald Trump to take action or Trump could act on his own authority if he’s determined that the local authorities are so overwhelmed that they can’t adequately enforce the law, Vladeck said.“It is a very, very broad grant of authority for the president,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pentagon-puts-military-police-on-alert-to-go-to-minneapolis/story-1T8JAxfoRHMwDk7Bi4VsLO.html

California-based Gilead has said it will donate 1.5 million doses of remdesivir, enough to treat at least 140,000 patients, to combat the global pandemic.Taiwan’s Central Epidemic Command Centre said the Taiwan Food and Drug Administration took into account “the fact that the efficacy and safety of remdesivir has been supported by preliminary evidence” and its use is being approved by other countries.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageOn that basis, the centre said the conditions had been met for approval of the drug for use in patients with “severe” Covid-19 infection.Taiwan has been successful at preventing the coronavirus from spreading, thanks to early detection and prevention work and a first rate public health system.It has recorded 442 cases and only 7 deaths. The vast majority of people have recovered, with just 14 active cases.There is currently no approved medication or vaccine for Covid-19, but EU countries are already administering remdesivir to patients under compassionate use rules.Japan and the United Kingdom have both cleared the drug for use and moved to begin supplying it to patients.The United States, the world’s biggest pharmaceutical market, this month granted emergency use authorisation for remdesivir in Covid-19, but has yet to approve the broader use of the drug.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-approves-gilead-s-remdesivir-to-treat-covid-19/story-DfWMGZcEPAKxEzjpgKCUSO.html
30-05-2020||World||UN adopts new voting procedure during Covid-19 pandemic||The UN General Assembly adopted a new voting procedure Friday for the upcoming election of new members of the Security Council aimed at preventing a large gathering and ensuring social distancing during the Covid-19 pandemic.Instead of meeting in the horseshoe-shaped assembly chamber at UN headquarters overlooking New York’s East River, ambassadors from the 193 UN member nations will cast secret ballots at a designated venue during spaced-out time slots.And they will be voting not only for five non-permanent members of the Security Council to serve two-year terms but for 18 new members of the 54-nation Economic and Social Council to serve three-year terms.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageAccording to the new procedure, the president of the General Assembly will send a letter to all member states at least 10 working days before the first round of secret balloting for the two elections to inform them of the date, venue where ballots should be cast, and other relevant information.The Security Council election had been scheduled for June 17, but it’s unclear whether that will remain the date.The Security Council has five permanent members — the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France — and 10 members elected by the General Assembly for two-year terms. Five countries are elected every year.The council is the UN’s most powerful body and winning a seat is a pinnacle of achievement for many countries because it gives them a strong voice on issues of international peace and security ranging from conflicts in Syria, Yemen and Ukraine to the nuclear threat posed by North Korea and Iran, and attacks by extremist groups such as the Islamic State and al-Qaida.This year seven countries are vying for five seats, and there are two hotly contested races.In the group of Western nation, Canada, Ireland and Norway are battling for two seats, and in Africa, Kenya and Djibouti are competing for one seat. India is running unopposed for the Asia-Pacific seat and Mexico is running unopposed for the seat for Latin America and the Caribbean.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-adopts-new-voting-procedure-during-covid-19-pandemic/story-b5pAxHih1TOijjxQLarHDN.html
30-05-2020||World||China says US move to end some trading privileges of Hong Kong ‘doomed to fail’||The mouthpiece of China’s ruling Communist Party said US moves to end some trading privileges for Hong Kong “grossly interfere” in China’s internal affairs and are “doomed to fail.”Saturday’s editorial in the newspaper People’s Daily was responding to an announcement from President Donald Trump, after China’s ceremonial parliament bypassed Hong Kong’s local legislature to advance legislation that could severely curtail free speech and opposition political activities in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory.It was the “firm determination of all Chinese people” to oppose interference in Hong Kong affairs by any external forces, the paper said.“This hegemonic act of attempting to interfere in Hong Kong affairs and grossly interfere in China’s internal affairs will not frighten the Chinese people and is doomed to fail,” it said. Attempts at “forcing China to make concessions on core interests including sovereignty and security through blackmailing or coercion ... can only be wishful thinking and day-dreaming!”China has threatened to retaliate over the US move to cancel trading advantages granted to Hong Kong after its handover from British to Chinese rule in 1997.Tensions over Hong Kong have increased over the past year as China has cracked down on protesters and strengthened its control over the Asian financial hub.Critics say the vote Thursday at the National People’s Congress to impose security legislation on Hong Kong effectively negates Beijing’s pledge to maintain the territory’s separate civil, legal and economic institutions under the “one country, two systems” framework.Trump said the administration would begin eliminating the “full range” of agreements that had given Hong Kong a relationship with the U.S. that mainland China lacked, including exemptions from controls on certain exports. “China has replaced its promised formula of one country, two systems, with one country, one system,” he said.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo notified Congress on Wednesday that Hong Kong is no longer deserving of the preferential trade and commercial status it has enjoyed from the US.It’s not yet clear what impact the decision will have on US companies that operate in Hong Kong, or on the city’s position as Asia’s major financial hub. Beijing has yet to give details on what specific measures it will take in response, although the People’s Daily editorial said China was prepared to make a “resolute counterattack and what awaits you can only be a shameful failure.”In Hong Kong on Saturday, Secretary for Justice Teresa Cheng said it was “completely false and wrong” to say the territory was losing its autonomy.China’s central authorities have the absolute right to take action on national security regarding Hong Kong, Cheng told reporters.She also criticized the U.S., saying “any other state that tries to use coercion or whatever means with a view to interfering with the sovereign right of a state to pass its own national security law is arguably infringing on the principle of non-intervention under public international law, and that is not acceptable.”China passed the Hong Kong national security law after stiff public opposition scuppered a previous attempt by the territory’s legislature to pass such legislation in 2003.Beijing’s resolve appeared to have been hardened by months of anti-government protests in Hong Kong that frequently led to violent confrontations between police and the largely youthful demonstrators. China repeatedly accused foreign governments and international organizations of fueling the demonstrations, while showing no direct evidence.Speculation over Washington’s response has included the possibility that those connected with the crackdown, including members of the Hong Kong police force, could face US travel bans or other sanctions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-says-us-move-to-end-some-trading-privileges-of-hong-kong-doomed-to-fail/story-XluDT1ENJoH6tlXxrPawkK.html
30-05-2020||World||Donald Trump blames China for US Covid-19 deaths in new escalation of rhetoric||President Donald Trump on Friday escalated attacks on China holding it responsible for Covid-19 deaths in the United States and worldwide as he also announced he was “terminating” US membership of the World Health Organization (WHO) for its failure to carry out reforms, chiefly cutting dependence on China.The president also announced the United States will now not allow certain students and researchers from China linked to its military technology programmes from enrolling in US universities saying they were involved in theft of patented technology. He also ended special status for Hong Kong.“The world is now suffering as a result of the malfeasance of the Chinese government,” Trump said in a short speech at a White House event that was supposed to have been a news briefing. But he did not take questions and left abruptly after reading out a short statement.“China’s cover-up of the Wuhan virus allowed the disease to spread all over the world instigating a global pandemic that has cost more than 100,000 American lives and over a million lives worldwide,” the president said, using nomenclature for the epidemic adopted by his administration to reinforce its efforts to blame it on China. Covid-19 epidemic started in Wuhan, capital of China’s Hubei province, last December.President Trump has been attacking China in what has been widely seen by his critics as a move to deflect blame for the US epidemic, with nearly 103,000 fatalities now and 1.7 million infections, away from his administration’s confused and conflicted response influenced by his reluctance to acknowledge the gravity of the crisis so as to minimize its impact on his re-election prospects.The World Health Organization is his other target. “Because they have failed to make the requested and greatly needed reforms, we will be today terminating our relationship with the World Health Organization and will be redirecting those funds to other organizations worldwide and deserving urgent public health needs,” Trump said at the news briefing.Trump had sent WHO a list of reforms — chiefly, ending its dependence on China — that the United States wanted it to carry out with the threat of permanently freezing its annual contribution of $450 million and terminating its membership.“The only way forward for the organization is if it can actually demonstrate independence from China,” he had written in a four-page letter to WHO director general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus last week. He had given the world body 30 days to respond.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage The United States has exited a number of world bodies and multilateral pacts on President Trump’s watch, starting with the Trans-Pacific Partnership in January 2017, the month he took office. This was followed by departures from the Paris Accord on climate change (2017), UNESCO (2017), Iran deal (2018) and UNHCR (2018). The president has also grumbled about US contributions to NATO and the United Nations.And now WHO. The United States was the leading force behind the founding of the world body in 1948 and was its largest funder. Its exit in the middle of a pandemic has been questioned by even his own party allies. “I disagree with the president’s decision,” said US Senate health committee chairman Lamar Alexander, a Republican, in a statement.“Withdrawing US membership could, among other things, interfere with clinical trials that are essential to the development of vaccines, which citizens of the United States as well as others in the world need. And withdrawing could make it harder to work with other countries to stop viruses before they get to the United States,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-blames-china-for-us-covid-19-deaths-in-new-escalation-of-rhetoric/story-LJPhfxOs4AeyYxJfvjGqJO.html

The pandemic has demonstrated our fragility. Despite all the technological and scientific advances of recent decades, we are in an unprecedented human crisis, because of a microscopic virus,” the UN Secretary General said on Thursday to the high-level event on Financing For Development.He underlined the need for the world to respond to the unprecedented crisis with unity and solidarity. “Unless we act now, the Covid-19 pandemic will cause unimaginable devastation and suffering around the world. Hunger and famine of historic proportions. Sixty million more people pushed into extreme poverty. Up to half the global workforce – 1.6 billion people – without livelihoods,” Guterres said He said the pandemic could usher in a loss of USD 8.5 trillion in global output – the sharpest contraction since the Great Depression of the 1930s.Globally, coronavirus has infected 5,813,997 people and killed 360,397, according to Johns Hopkins University.Later addressing a virtual press conference along with Prime Minister of Jamaica Andrew Holness and Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau, Guterres said the world is afflicted by enormous fragilities: weak health systems; runaway climate change; unsustainable levels of inequality. “We see other signs of this fragility everywhere, from the increasing risk of nuclear proliferation to the lawlessness of cyberspace. Ignoring these warning signs is senseless arrogance. Existential threats demand humility, unity and solidarity,” he said adding that the world cannot contemplate a return to the same failed priorities and systems.“We must invest in a sustainable and inclusive recovery.” When asked at the press conference why did the US and China not speak at the high-level event in which over 50 Heads of State and Government and international organisations spoke, Guterres said “both US and China participated in our work. Of course, this was decided because of the very high participation that it could be only at the level of heads of state and government and both countries, for reasons of agenda, could not do that at that level, but they would be ready to participate at other levels.The US and China are currently engaged in a war of words over a range of issues, including on trade, the origins of the coronavirus epidemic and Hong Kong.“But they will be engaged in the Working Group. So, there is a commitment both from the United States and China to be involved in this process, which we very much welcome.” Guterres told the high-level meeting that the UN is asking for immediate, collective action in six critically important areas to deal with the crisis.Beginning with the global liquidity crisis, he said that this was where the health and economic crises meet; “a dangerous nexus that could prolong and deepen both,” calling for extending Special Drawing Rights to supplement public spending reserves.Noting that the economic fallout from the pandemic threatens a wave of defaults in developing countries, stymieing the effort to reach the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals, the UN chief’s second call was for “durable solutions on debt, to create space for investments in recovery and the Sustainable Development Goals.” Next, he urged private creditors holding a growing share of developing countries’ sovereign debt to find incentives to encourage more creditors to provide debt relief.Guterres then drew attention to external funding, saying that aligning incentives in global financial systems with the SDGs would boost confidence “to relaunch investment in sustainable development.” Turning to illicit financial flow, such as tax evasion and money-laundering, which deprive developing countries of hundreds of billions of dollars annually, he said that “we must plug the leaks” by revising national systems and international frameworks.The UN chief also highlighted the overarching need to “recover better” from the ravages of the coronavirus pandemic.Trudeau called the pandemic “a stark reminder” of how interconnected our world has become, spelling out that “to keep our citizens safe and healthy, we must defeat Covid-19 wherever it is found.” This requires a global, coordinated plan that will also facilitate global and domestic economies to bounce back.Jobs and businesses in every country depend on “the health and stability of economies elsewhere” – all of which is hinged on the success of the global economy in weathering this storm, said the co-convener of the high-level summit.“Covid-19 is an unprecedented challenge for our modern world, but it’s also a unique opportunity to build a better future, to create a safe and prosperous world,” he added.Holness called the pandemic “a wake-up call” for the international community to reinvigorate a comprehensive system of global economic governance “that can cope with global disruptions while promoting inclusive development.” He said a big challenge for the international financial system was to channel public and private credit flows, into productive, inclusive developmental capital flows.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-could-cause-8-5-trillion-dollar-loss-in-global-output-says-un-chief-antonio-guterres/story-B4VtOti9tb3SJqgjhE0EBK.html
30-05-2020||World||West Bengal doctor says state shifting to Sweden model to contain coronavirus||With West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee announcing the easing of lockdown restrictions in the state, a renowned doctor said that following ramping up of COVID-19 tests, the government seems to be gradually shifting towards the Sweden or Taiwan model to contain the pandemic.Dr Diptendra Sarkar of the state-run SSKM Hospital said that with the countrywide lockdown having been in force for nearly 70 days and the government, both at the Centre and the state, having shored up resources during the period to deal with the disease, it was time for a gradual easing of restrictions.“I feel that they are shifting the model, they were till now going by the hammer and the tongs model which is a lockdown,” he said.Referring to the 72-day lockdown in Wuhan, he said that a lockdown of 60 to 70 days brings down the number of cases of infection.“The Sweden model or that in Taiwan or South Korea, where instead of lockdown they stressed on testing and segregating high-risk population, they have got equal success,” Sarkar said.He opined that the government had enforced a strict lockdown in the beginning owing to lack of testing facilities, but now with a countrywide testing capacity of around one lakh per day, the government is shifting towards the Sweden or South Korea or Taiwan model from the lockdown model.He said that according to a study by the Imperial College of London, if 60 per cent of the population wear ordinary masks, then it can prevent 90 per cent spread of infections.“As an epidemic progresses, a virus in order to survive reduces fatality among its host and gradually loses its vigour,” Sarkar said.While agreeing that the lockdown has to be lifted at some point of time, the Association of Health Service Doctors secretary Dr Manas Gumta expressed his reservations on the manner in which it was being eased in the state.He said that it is not about one-upmanship with the central government over bringing of thousands of people by trains from other states, including the most affected Maharashtra and Gujarat, but there has to be a scientific basis on the way the lockdown is lifted.“Lockdown is simply for buying time by which the health infrastructure can be readied to deal with the pandemic effectively as also for non-COVID patients,” he said, adding that it has to be lifted but in a phased manner.“The way the lockdown is being practically lifted without any preparation, it may lead to a catastrophe,” he said.Gumta said the government needs revenue and people also require livelihood and as such lockdown has to be lifted gradually.“But what is the purpose of opening up religious places, at this juncture, where people may congregate in large numbers,” he questioned. He said that with work from home becoming common in various sectors, there was no need to open up all sectors with full workforce.Gumta also opined that the government should introduce shift systems in offices so as to ease the crowding of many people at a time, in workplaces as well as in public transport.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/west-bengal-doctor-says-state-shifting-to-sweden-model-to-contain-coronavirus/story-vGLR5gXhL8e9Np4bI2PpJP.html

McDade went by male pronouns on Facebook and local LGBTQ organizations identified McDade as a transgender man.Tallahassee Police Chief Lawrence Revell said officers found Jackson suffering from fatal stab wounds in front of his mother’s home.The suspect fled but was found 15 minutes later at a different apartment complex, Revell said.McDade had a gun and pointed it at an officer, who then shot him, Revell said. Police haven’t released the officer’s identity but witnesses said the officer was white, news outlets reported.During a news conference, Revell said there was no indication that the shooting was racially motivated nor was there an indication that the shooting was unjustified.McDade posted a video on Facebook before the stabbing, stating he was going to get revenge on several men who attacked him the previous day. McDade also said he would have a standoff with police, adding “I’m living suicidal right now.”Another social media video shows a group of men attack a person believed to be McDade.Police said they were working to authenticate the videos.McDade was arrested on May 4 and accused of aggravated assault and pointing a gun at someone.

30-05-2020||World||End of ties: After WHO announcement, a look at international agreements that US has quit under Trump’s presidency||Just days after writing a four-page long letter to the World Health Organization Chief (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus earlier this month, US President Donald Trump on Friday announced severing ties with the global health body and said the country’s annual contribution of $450 million towards the WHO will be diverted to other global bodies.“Because they have failed to make the requested and greatly needed reforms, we will be today terminating our relationship with the World Health Organization and will be redirecting those funds to other worldwide and deserving urgent public health needs,” Trump said during a news briefing announcing that the US will also end special status for Hong Kong and treat it on par with Mainland China. The move comes amid growing tensions between the US and China over the coronavirus pandemic.Also read: Donald Trump announced US is cutting ties with WHO. Here’s whyThis is nothing new for the US President who is known to have exited many international pacts and world bodies ever since he took charge in 2017, one of the most significant ones being the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) or the Iran nuclear deal. Here’s a quick look at some of the multilateral pacts and global bodies exited by the US under Trump administration.Trans-Pacific Partnership Right after assuming office as the US President, Trump exited 12-nation TPP and fulfilled one of his electoral promises which he said was aimed at protecting US jobs. The original 12-member agreement was known as the TPP and was a signature trade policy of the Obama administration. Obama was unable to secure Congressional support for the deal. Following the US withdrawal, the remaining 11 countries renegotiated parts of the TPP, removing some of Washington’s demands. In March, they signed the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), also known as TPP-11.Drafted in the year 2015, the trade deal covered nearly 40 per cent of the world’s economy and was negotiated by countries like the US, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Mexico, among others with an aim to boost growth, improve economic ties and reduce tariffs.pic.twitter.com/mljmx2o0G7Paris Accord on climate change This was another departure from an Obama-era deal. Trump withdrew from the accord in the year 2017 citing threat to the country’s economy and sovereignty. The Obama administration had signed the United States onto the 2015 pact, promising a 26-28% cut in US greenhouse gas emissions by 2025 from 2005 levels. Trump said the agreement was not in tune with American workers. Iran nuclear dealIn May 2018, Trump announced US exit from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action or the Iran nuclear deal. The 2015 international agreement was designed to deny Tehran the ability to build nuclear weapons.Another Obama-era agreement, Trump had previously dismissed the deal as “insane” and “ridiculous”. Former US President Barack Obama, in a statement on US exit from JCPOA, said, “Walking away from the JCPOA turns our back on America’s closest allies, and an agreement that our country’s leading diplomats, scientists, and intelligence professionals negotiated”. United Nations Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO)United States’ withdrawal from the UNESCO was led by Trump in the year 2017 citing “anti-Israel bias”. The US was upset with the UNESCO for granting full membership to Palestine while Israel maintained it should have been granted only after working out a peace deal in the Middle East. United Nations Human Rights CouncilThe United States exited the UNHRC in the year 2018 citing bias against Israel and a lack of reform. “Look at the council membership, and you see an appalling disrespect for the most basic rights,” then US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said on US exit.  The US president has also grumbled about US contributions to NATO and the United Nations. He had previously threatened to quit the Universal Postal Union to force them to rationalise rates. The US did not make an exit as they arrived at a compromise.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/end-of-ties-after-who-announcement-a-look-at-international-agreements-that-us-has-quit-under-trump-s-presidency/story-nq7pc7FFSGPbqYkMkiR47K.html
30-05-2020||World||Donald Trump announced US is cutting ties with WHO. Here’s why||The United States will end its relationship with the World Health Organization (WHO) over the world body’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, US President Donald Trump said on Friday.Trump’s decision to sever ties with the Geneva-based body also comes amid growing tensions between the US and China over the coronavirus pandemic.The virus first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year and has killed more than 3.64 people worldwide and affected over 5.9 million.Watch: Donald Trump terminates relationship with WHO, announces actions against China “Because they have failed to make the requested and greatly needed reforms, we will be today terminating our relationship with the World Health Organization and will be redirecting those funds to other worldwide and deserving urgent public health needs,” Trump said at a news briefing.Also read| ‘World needs answers’: Donald Trump renews attack on China over Covid-19 pandemicTrump had sent a list of reforms that the United States wanted the world body to carry out.“The only way forward for the organization is if it can actually demonstrate independence from China,” he had written in a four-page letter to WHO director general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus last week. He had given the WHO, which the US joined in 1948, 30 days to respond.Here’s what he wrote in that letter:On April 14, 2020, I suspended United States contributions to the World Health Organization pending an investigation by my Administration of the organization’s failed response to the COVID-19 outbreak. This review has confirmed many of the serious concerns I raised last month and identified others that the World Health Organization should have addressed, especially the World Health Organization’s alarming lack of independence from the People’s Republic of China. Based on this review, we now know the following:• The World Health Organization consistently ignored credible reports of the virus spreading in Wuhan in early December 2019 or even earlier, including reports from the Lancet medical journal. The World Health Organization failed to independently investigate credible reports that conflicted directly with the Chinese government’s official accounts, even those that came from sources within Wuhan itself.• By no later than December 30, 2019, the World Health Organization office in Beijing knew that there was a “major public health” concern in Wuhan. Between December 26 and December 30, China’s media highlighted evidence of a new virus emerging from Wuhan, based on patient data sent to multiple Chinese genomics companies. Additionally, during this period, Dr. Zhang Jixian, a doctor from Hubei Provincial Hospital of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine, told China’s health authorities that a new coronavirus was causing a novel disease that was, at the time, afflicting approximately 180 patients.• By the next day, Taiwanese authorities had communicated information to the World Health Organization indicating human-to-human transmission of a new virus. Yet the World Health Organization chose not to share any of this critical information with the rest of the world, probably for political reasons.• The International Health Regulations require countries to report the risk of a health emergency within 24 hours. But China did not inform the World Health Organization of Wuhan’s several cases of pneumonia, of unknown origin, until December 31, 2019, even though it likely had knowledge of these cases days or weeks earlier.• According to Dr. Zhang Yongzhen of the Shanghai Public Health Clinic Center, he told Chinese authorities on January 5, 2020, that he had sequenced the genome of the virus. There was no publication of this information until six days later, on January 11, 2020, when Dr. Zhang self-posted it online. The next day, Chinese authorities closed his lab for “rectification.” As even the World Health Organization acknowledged, Dr. Zhang’s posting was a great act of “transparency.” But the World Health Organization has been conspicuously silent both with respect to the closure of Dr. Zhang’s lab and his assertion that he had notified Chinese authorities of his breakthrough six days earlier.• The World Health Organization has repeatedly made claims about the coronavirus that were either grossly inaccurate or misleading.- On January 14, 2020, the World Health Organization gratuitously reaffirmed China’s now-debunked claim that the coronavirus could not be transmitted between humans, stating: “Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) identified in Wuhan, China.” This assertion was in direct conflict with censored reports from Wuhan.- On January 21, 2020, President Xi Jinping of China reportedly pressured you not to declare the coronavirus outbreak an emergency. You gave in to this pressure the next day and told the world that the coronavirus did not pose a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Just over one week later, on January 30, 2020, overwhelming evidence to the contrary forced you to reverse course.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage - On January 28, 2020, after meeting with President Xi in Beijing, you praised the Chinese government for its “transparency” with respect to the coronavirus, announcing that China had set a “new standard for outbreak control” and “bought the world time.” You did not mention that China had, by then, silenced or punished several doctors for speaking out about the virus and restricted Chinese institutions from publishing information about it.• Even after you belatedly declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on January 30, 2020, you failed to press China for the timely admittance of a World Health Organization team of international medical experts. As a result, this critical team did not arrive in China until two weeks later, on February 16, 2020. And even then, the team was not allowed to visit Wuhan until the final days of their visit. Remarkably, the World Health Organization was silent when China denied the two American members of the team access to Wuhan entirely.• You also strongly praised China’s strict domestic travel restrictions, but were inexplicably against my closing of the United States border, or the ban, with respect to people coming from China. I put the ban in place regardless of your wishes. Your political gamesmanship on this issue was deadly, as other governments, relying on your comments, delayed imposing life-saving restrictions on travel to and from China. Incredibly, on February 3, 2020, you reinforced your position, opining that because China was doing such a great job protecting the world from the virus, travel restrictions were “causing more harm than good.” Yet by then the world knew that, before locking down Wuhan, Chinese authorities had allowed more than five million people to leave the city and that many of these people were bound for international destinations all over the world.• As of February 3, 2020, China was strongly pressuring countries to lift or forestall travel restrictions. This pressure campaign was bolstered by your incorrect statements on that day telling the world that the spread of the virus outside of China was “minimal and slow” and that “the chances of getting this going to anywhere outside China [were] very low.”• On March 3, 2020, the World Health Organization cited official Chinese data to downplay the very serious risk of asymptomatic spread, telling the world that “COVID-19 does not transmit as efficiently as influenza” and that unlike influenza this disease was not primarily driven by “people who are infected but not yet sick.” China’s evidence, the World Health Organization told the world, “showed that only one percent of reported cases do not have symptoms, and most of those cases develop symptoms within two days.” Many experts, however, citing data from Japan, South Korea, and elsewhere, vigorously questioned these assertions. It is now clear that China’s assertions, repeated to the world by the World Health Organization, were wildly inaccurate.• By the time you finally declared the virus a pandemic on March 11, 2020, it had killed more than 4,000 people and infected more than 100,000 people in at least 114 countries around the world.• On April 11, 2020, several African Ambassadors wrote to the Chinese Foreign Ministry about the discriminatory treatment of Africans related to the pandemic in Guangzhou and other cities in China. You were aware that Chinese authorities were carrying out a campaign of forced quarantines, evictions, and refusal of services against the nationals of these countries. You have not commented on China’s racially discriminatory actions. You have, however, baselessly labeled as racist Taiwan’s well-founded complaints about your mishandling of this pandemic.• Throughout this crisis, the World Health Organization has been curiously insistent on praising China for its alleged “transparency.” You have consistently joined in these tributes, notwithstanding that China has been anything but transparent. In early January, for example, China ordered samples of the virus to be destroyed, depriving the world of critical information. Even now, China continues to undermine the International Health Regulations by refusing to share accurate and timely data, viral samples and isolates, and by withholding vital information about the virus and its origins. And, to this day, China continues to deny international access to their scientists and relevant facilities, all while casting blame widely and recklessly and censoring its own experts.• The World Health Organization has failed to publicly call on China to allow for an independent investigation into the origins of the virus, despite the recent endorsement for doing so by its own Emergency Committee. The World Health Organization’s failure to do so has prompted World Health Organization member states to adopt the “COVID-19 Response” Resolution at this year’s World Health Assembly, which echoes the call by the United States and so many others for an impartial, independent, and comprehensive review of how the World Health Organization handled the crisis. The resolution also calls for an investigation into the origins of the virus, which is necessary for the world to understand how best to counter the disease.Perhaps worse than all these failings is that we know that the World Health Organization could have done so much better. Just a few years ago, under the direction of a different Director-General, the World Health Organization showed the world how much it has to offer. In 2003, in response to the outbreak of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in China, Director-General Harlem Brundtland boldly declared the World Health Organization’s first emergency travel advisory in 55 years, recommending against travel to and from the disease epicenter in southern China. She also did not hesitate to criticize China for endangering global health by attempting to cover up the outbreak through its usual playbook of arresting whistleblowers and censoring media. Many lives could have been saved had you followed Dr. Brundtland’s example. It is clear the repeated missteps by you and your organization in responding to the pandemic have been extremely costly for the world. The only way forward for the World Health Organization is if it can actually demonstrate independence from China. My Administration has already started discussions with you on how to reform the organization. But action is needed quickly. We do not have time to waste. That is why it is my duty, as President of the United States, to inform you that, if the World Health Organization does not commit to major substantive improvements within the next 30 days, I will make my temporary freeze of United States funding to the World Health Organization permanent and reconsider our membership in the organization. I cannot allow American taxpayer dollars to continue to finance an organization that, in its present state, is so clearly not serving America’s interests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-announced-us-is-cutting-ties-with-who-here-s-why/story-IviMIL3J5peLO5YJFKu61M.html

Top among those include former US Ambassador to India Richard Verma; former Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs Nisha Desai Biswal; former US Chief Technology Officer Aneesh Chopra and former Deputy White House Cabinet Secretary Gaurav Bansal. Kiran Ahuja, former Executive Director, White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders; Seema Nanda, former Chief of Staff, Department of Labour and Sonal Shah, former Director, White House Office of Social Innovation and Civic Participation along with several Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPI) former Obama-Biden administration officials also endorsed the former US vice president. “All of us served with Vice President Joe Biden in the Obama-Biden administration. We watched him help 20 million Americans gain health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. We watched him lift our country out of the depths of the Great Recession. And we watched him build stronger ties with our allies and stand up to our adversaries abroad,” the former officials said in a joint statement. “Most importantly, all of us saw Joe Biden’s empathy, his decency, and his commitment to expanding opportunity for all Americans. He has a deep appreciation for the contributions of AAPI and a keen understanding of the challenges still facing the community,” they said. “Now more than ever, we need a President who values our nation’s diversity and will fight to create a more fair and just country. That person is Joe Biden. We are proud to endorse him for President and support him in this fight to restore the soul of our nation,” they said in the statement. Biden, 77, is the presumptive presidential nominee of the Democratic Party. He is likely to be formally nominated by the Democratic National Convention in Wisconsin in August. He has already been endorsed by several leaders, including his one-time rivals for the Democratic nomination Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, former president Obama and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-indian-americans-who-served-in-obama-admin-endorse-biden-for-president-in-2020-us-polls/story-CKd2mrdRZh7tEB2G2gqwkK.html
30-05-2020||World||‘World needs answers’: Donald Trump renews attack on China over Covid-19 pandemic||US President Donald Trump on Friday said that America is terminating its relationship with the World Health Organization as he blamed it and China for the deaths and destruction caused by the Covid-19 pandemic across the globe.Stating that the funding of the WHO would now be diverted to other global public health organisations, Trump announced a series of decisions against China including issuing proclamation to deny entry to certain Chinese nationals and tightening of regulations against Chinese investments in America.Trump also announced that the US will end special treatment of Hong Kong in response to Chinese imposition of new controls.He said that the US will revise its travel advisory to warn of surveillance in Hong Kong.“The world needs answers from China,” Trump said in his aggressive speech on a bright sunny day from the Rose Garden of the White House.The president, however, did not take any questions.For decades it has ripped off the US like no one has ever done before, he said, reiterating his charges against China.China not only stole intellectual property, took away billions of dollars from the US and offshored the jobs, but also violated its commitment under the World Trade Organization, he said, adding that it was able to get away with the theft, like no one before because of past politicians and past presidents.China, he alleged, has unlawfully claimed territories in the Indo-Pacific ocean, threatening freedom of navigation and international trade and broke its word to the world on ensuring the autonomy of Hong Kong.“The United States wants an open and constructive relationship with China, but achieving this relationship requires us to vigorously defend our national interest,” he said. Trump alleged that the Chinese government has continually violated its promises to the US and many other nations. “These plain facts cannot be overlooked or swept aside,” he said. Observing that the world is now suffering as a result of the malfeasance of the Chinese government, Trump reiterated that China’s cover-up of the Wuhan virus allowed the disease to spread all over the world, instigating a global pandemic that has cost more than 100,000 American lives and over one million lives worldwide. “Chinese officials ignored their reporting obligations to the World Health Organization and pressured the World Health Organization to mislead the world when the virus was first discovered by Chinese authorities. Countless lives have been taken, and profound economic hardship has been inflicted all around the globe,” he said. China, he said, has total control over the WHO despite only paying $40 million per year compared to what the US has been paying which is approximately $450 million a year. “We have detailed the reforms that it must make and engage with them directly, but they have refused to act. “Because they have failed to make the requested and greatly needed reforms, we will be today terminating our relationship with the World Health Organization and redirecting those funds to other worldwide and deserving urgent global public health needs,” Trump said. The world needs answers from China on the virus, he said. “We must have transparency. Why is it that China shut off infected people from Wuhan to all other parts of China? It went nowhere else; it didn’t go to Beijing, it went nowhere else, but they allowed them to freely travel throughout the world, including Europe and the United States. The death and destruction caused by this is incalculable,” he said. “We must have answers not only for us but for the rest of the world. This pandemic has underscored the crucial importance of building up America’s economic independence, reshoring our critical supply chains, and protecting America’s scientific and technological advances. For years, the government of China has conducted illicit espionage to steal our industrial secrets of which there are many,” Trump said. Trump said that later in the day, he will issue a proclamation to better secure America’s vital university research and “to suspend the entry of certain foreign nationals from China who have been identified as potential security risks”. Asserting that he is also taking action to protect the integrity of America’s financial system, Trump said he is instructing his presidential working group on financial markets to study the differing practices of Chinese companies listed on the US financial markets with a goal of protecting American investors. “Investment firms should not be subjecting their clients to the hidden and undue risks associated with financing Chinese companies that do not play by the same rules. Americans are entitled to fairness and transparency,” he said. Referring to the unilateral Chinese action control over Hong Kong security, Trump said that this was a plain violation of Beijing’s treaty obligations with the UK in the declaration of 1984 and explicit provisions of Hong Kong’s basic law which has 27 years to go. “China’s latest incursion, along with other recent developments that degraded the territory’s freedoms, makes clear that Hong Kong is no longer sufficiently autonomous to warrant the special treatment that we have afforded the territory since the handover,” he said. “China has replaced its promised formula of one country, two systems with one country, one system; therefore, I am directing my administration to begin the process of eliminating policy exemptions that give Hong Kong different and special treatment,” Trump added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-needs-answers-donald-trump-renews-attack-on-china-over-covid-19-pandemic/story-iSZ41Sd5baZmlcNmVGsphO.html
30-05-2020||World||Biden speaks of racial ‘open wound,’ contrasting with Trump||Joe Biden lamented the “open wound” of the nation’s systemic racism on Friday as he responded to the police killing of a black man in Minnesota. He drew an implicit contrast with President Donald Trump, who has suggested authorities could respond with violence to the protests that followed George Floyd’s death.“The original sin of this country still stains our nation today,” Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, said in remarks broadcast from his home in Wilmington, Delaware. “It’s time for us to take a hard look at uncomfortable truths.”Biden announced his bid for the presidency last year arguing he’s uniquely positioned to unite a deeply divided country. He pointed to Trump’s response to a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, as unworthy of America’s people and values.As the country endures another spasm of racial unrest, the central premise of Biden’s campaign is being tested. Biden is responding by positioning himself as an empathetic counter to Trump, who often struggles to convey emotion or connect on a personal level during moments of crisis.Biden said he spoke with Floyd’s family and demanded justice for his death while calling for “real police reform that holds all cops up to the high standards that so many of them actually meet.” The president later said that he, too, had spoken with Floyd’s family and called them “terrific people.”Trump initially condemned police actions in Floyd’s death but later agitated the unrest by tweeting that protesters could be met with violent police resistance. He threatened to take action to bring Minneapolis “under control,” called violent protesters outraged by the killing “thugs” and revived a civil-rights-era phrase fraught with racist overtones.“When the looting starts, the shooting starts,” Trump wrote in a tweet that was flagged by Twitter as violating rules against “glorifying violence.” The White House said the president “did not glorify violence. He clearly condemned it.”By Friday afternoon, Trump sought to acknowledge the shocking circumstances of Floyd’s death while commending law enforcement.“He was in tremendous pain, obviously, and couldn’t breathe,” the president said of Floyd. “It was a very, very sad thing for me to see it. We also know that most policemen, you see the great job they do.”Biden, without mentioning Trump by name, made clear he would approach the presidency differently.“This is no time for incendiary tweets. This is no time to encourage violence,” Biden said. “This is a national crisis, and we need real leadership right now. Leadership that will bring everyone to the table so we can take measures to root out systemic racism.”Later appearing on PBS, Biden pointed more openly at Trump: “I think this president has stoked racism.”Rep. Val Demings, a Florida Democrat considered a potential Biden running mate, criticized Trump’s response.“America is on fire,” she said in an interview Friday. “And this president is standing there with gasoline. He is dangerous. He’s destructive, he’s dangerous and he can’t even rise to this occasion.”Amid the outrage, Biden tried to make the rest of the country feel what it was like to be African American in modern US society.“Every day, African Americans go about their lives with constant anxiety and trauma, wondering who will be next,” he said, adding, “the anger and the frustration and the exhaustion — it’s undeniable.”Biden must go beyond establishing himself as a calming alternative to the president and demonstrate that he will take action that spurs the unity he’s promised. It’s a feat he may have to accomplish in a hurry if he wants to inspire African Americans to turn out for him in November.The task is especially critical after Biden suggested last week that African American voters who were still undecided between him and Trump “ain’t black,” a comment that some black leaders said were interpreted as taking their votes for granted. Biden quickly said he regretted the comment.NAACP President Derrick Johnson said he believes the nation is in chaos because of a lack of leadership in the White House. But he said change will only come by putting people in positions of power who will be willing to boldly address the needs of affected communities.“I think the real question is, what are people going to do about it and how are those who are in positions of authority, and those who are seeking positions of authority, how are they going to lay out a plan moving forward?” Johnson said. “It’s about what is the collective will of this society to address the systemic deficits that we all know so well but lack the political will to address.”Moments of acute racial tension have afforded platforms for leadership from presidential candidates in the past. Robert F. Kennedy was seeking the White House in April 1968 and arriving in Indianapolis when he learned that Martin Luther King Jr. had been shot and killed. Kennedy stood on a flatbed truck and spoke about the country having to move past the terrible moments of racial strife — comments later credited with preventing unrest.Kennedy was assassinated two months later.Black Lives Matter co-founder Alicia Garza said Biden needs to use this moment to connect further with black people and create a more robust black agenda that specifically tackles the need for policing reform and more.“Black people cannot wait for an agenda that speaks to how it is that our lives will change under a new administration,” Garza said. “We currently have a president who is inciting violence against black communities and yet, on the other hand, we have somebody who wants to lead this country that needs to go further in their plans, proposals and their vision for how to make sure that we deal with the state of emergency that black communities are facing.”“It is not enough to engage in politics as usual,” Garza added, “and expect results, as usual.”___Stafford reported from Detroit.

Mortality was disproportionately high across all subgroups, including elective surgery (18.9%), emergency surgery (25.6%), minor surgery such as appendicectomy or hernia repair (16.3%), and major surgery such as hip surgery or colon cancer surgery (26.9%), the study says.It found higher mortality rates in men (28.4%) than in women (18.2%), and in patients aged 70 years or over (33.7%) against those aged under 70 years (13.9%). In addition to age and sex, risk factors for postoperative death included having severe pre-existing medical problems, undergoing cancer surgery, undergoing major procedures, and undergoing emergency surgery.Co-author Aneel Bhangu of the University of Birmingham said: “We would normally expect mortality for patients having minor or elective surgery to be under 1%, but our study suggests that in SARS-CoV-2 patients these mortality rates are much higher in both minor surgery (16.3%) and elective surgery (18.9%)”.“In fact, these mortality rates are greater than those reported for even the highest-risk patients before the pandemic…We recommend that thresholds for surgery during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic should be raised compared to normal practice”.Co-author Dmitri Nepogodiev added: “Worldwide an estimated 28.4 million elective operations were cancelled due to disruption caused by Covid-19…There’s now an urgent need for investment by governments and health providers in to measures to ensure that as surgery restarts patient safety is prioritised”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/surgery-after-covid-19-raises-death-risk-global-study/story-fJ2FYWIyTonmsiFlZzuKaL.html
30-05-2020||World||Trump moves to revoke Hong Kong’s trade status, stoking China Rift||President Donald Trump intensified his confrontation with China, vowing to punish the country for the coronavirus pandemic and steps to curb Hong Kong’s autonomy by ending the territory’s special trade status with the US and denying visas to Chinese officials.Citing a litany of grievances against the country, some dating to before he was elected president, Trump said the US would begin a process to revoke Hong Kong’s preferential trade status under US law. American financial regulators would examine Chinese firms listed on US stock markets with an eye toward limiting American investment in the companies, he said, and Chinese nationals considered to be security threats would be denied entry to the country.The US will terminate its support for the World Health Organization, Trump said, claiming the agency had been manipulated by Beijing during the pandemic and was under the “total control” of China.“Our actions will be strong, our actions will be meaningful,” the president said in a statement from the White House Rose Garden. He took no questions.But few of Trump’s actions will take place immediately, and US financial markets were untroubled by his announcement.US stocks erased losses and traded little changed as Trump stopped short of implementing more draconian measures against China, with the S&P 500 Index rose 0.3% as of 3:10 p.m. New York time.Trump’s announcement came after China’s legislature moved this week to impose a new national security law on Hong Kong that critics say will restrict freedoms in the city. The US president has also sought to blame China for the coronavirus pandemic that’s killed more than 100,000 Americans as domestic criticism of his handling of the outbreak has mounted.“China’s pattern of misconduct is well known,” Trump said, complaining about the history of the US trading relationship with the country.He said Beijing “unlawfully claimed territory in the Pacific Ocean” and “broke its word with the world on ensuring the autonomy of Hong Kong.”“The Chinese government has continuously violated its promises to us,” he said. “These plain facts cannot be overlooked or swept aside. The world is now suffering as a result of the malfeasance of the Chinese government,” he added, a reference to the pandemic.The retaliatory measures did not include withdrawal from the “phase one” trade deal Trump signed in January.China’s legislature has approved a plan to draft legislation that Hong Kong democracy advocates say will curtail freedom of speech and undermine the city’s independent judiciary.That prompted Secretary of State Michael Pompeo to announce earlier this week that the administration no longer considers the city sufficiently autonomous under a 1992 law that allows for easier travel and trade between the US and Hong Kong. The law also allows companies based in the Chinese territory access to American technologies deemed sensitive to national security that face export restrictions in mainland China.Chinese officials earlier Friday called potential US actions over Hong Kong “purely nonsense,” saying the matter was an internal affair and that essential freedoms in the city would remain intact.Beijing urged the US to stop its “frivolous political manipulation,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told reporters at a daily briefing, reiterating Beijing’s support for Hong Kong police in upholding the law. Chinese officials have indicated they may retaliate against US firms over the president’s decisions.Trump’s announcement follows weeks of growing anger toward Beijing within the White House. The president and his advisers have repeatedly blamed the Chinese government for the coronavirus outbreak that began in the country’s Hubei province but that has caused a far greater death toll in the US than China has publicly reported.“Frankly the US government is -- I’ll use the word ‘furious,’ at what China has done in recent days, weeks, and months,” White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told Fox News earlier on Friday. “They have not behaved well and they have lost the trust, I think, of the whole Western world.”The US outbreak and the associated economic collapse from social distancing practices adopted to curb the virus’s spread have damaged Trump’s prospects for re-election, public polling shows.Trump has also expressed frustration that Chinese purchases of US agricultural goods are lagging behind levels agreed to in the “phase one” trade agreement he signed with a delegation from Beijing in January.But Derek Scissors, a China analyst at conservative research group American Enterprise Institute, suggested Trump’s Friday announcement wasn’t as dramatic as the president intimated.”This binds the president to nothing with regards to China,” Scissors said. “With regards to a Hong Kong policy, it is a non-event. Nothing happened.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-moves-to-revoke-hong-kong-s-trade-status-stoking-china-rift/story-ps7EgFFzbNmVQ9VZk99yNM.html
30-05-2020||World||Italy wants independent probe into origin of pandemic, backs India’s call for reform of WHO: Italian minister||Italy wants an independent inquiry into the origin of the Covid-19 pandemic in China and backs India’s calls for reform of multilateral bodies such as WHO that didn’t perform as expected during the current crisis, the country’s minister for European affairs Vincenzo Amendola has said.With Italy and India set to take on the presidency of the G20 in 2021 and 2022, Amendola said the two countries would also play a key role in helping shape the post-Covid-19 world order, including global supply and value chains and ways to recover from the economic crisis created by the pandemic.In an interview with Hindustan Times over Skype, Amendola said Italy backs Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call, made during the G20 virtual summit on March 26, for reforms of international bodies such as the World Health Organization to meet the needs of a changing world.“The WHO for this crisis didn’t perform according to some criteria and…it’s necessary…to open an independent inquiry on what happened in China that was the starting place of this Covid-19 crisis,” he said.“Your prime minister was right because the multilateral aspect of the global order is not updated [with] the risks and opportunity of the current period. The WHO, I don’t think, it performed in a correct way during this crisis, there were many delays and many problems,” he added.Describing Europe and India as “sisters”, Amendola spoke of the need for closer cooperation between Italy and India both to shape the agenda of the G20 and to help fashion a new world order.“If I look where we are going to invest, I see that you [India] are the actor relevant for our common future,” he said, referring to the possibility of working together on green technologies such as renewable energy and digital transition, for which India is well placed because of its technological capability and human capital.With Italy set to become the G20 president in 2021 and India taking on the same role in 2022, Amendola said: “We are going to be the two countries that will bring the G20 out of the recession. We have a coordinated responsibility to present to the main actors on the global level how we can recover from this pandemic and this global economic crisis.”The Covid-19 had emerged as a “big test for multilateral cooperation”, he said.“A few months ago, there were many people who wanted to participate in the funeral of multilateralism but nowadays it is clear that multilateralism is necessary in order to strengthen the resilience of the global economy.”Amendola was also critical of China’s Belt and Road Initiative, saying Italy and India will have to work on “different aspects of free and fair trade” and “global legal standards” as the post-Covid-19 set-up moves towards new supply and value chains.“There is not just one way like the Belt and Road Initiative, there are many ways that we have to restore the global chain. There should be not just one way of distributing, producing and giving the ownership of this trade track. There should be…different options and the European Union is…devoted to diversification of rules of trade and creation of value chains,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italy-wants-independent-probe-into-origin-of-pandemic-backs-india-s-call-for-reform-of-who-italian-minister/story-VdRZCzTS9DWhv8tuofQoJJ.html

This statement of the Trump comes after China imposed a controversial national security law on Hong Kong that many critics have said will pose restrictions on Hong Kong’s freedom.“Because they have failed to make the requested and greatly needed reforms, we will be today terminating our relationship with the World Health Organization and will be redirecting those funds to other worldwide and deserving urgent public health needs,” Trump said at news briefing.Trump had sent a list of reforms that United States wanted the world body to carry out with the three of permanently freezing its contribution and terminating its membership, chiefly, end its dependence on China.“The only way forward for the organization is if it can actually demonstrate independence from China .” he had written in a four-page letter to WHO director general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus last week. He had given the world body 30 days to respond.The United States has exited a number of world bodies and multilateral pacts on President Trump’s watch, starting with the Trans-Pacific Partnership in January 2017, the month when he took office. This was followed by departures from the Paris Accord on climate change (2017), UNESCO (2017), Iran deal (2018) and UNHCR (2018).

30-05-2020||World||WHO, 37 nations launch alliance to share tools to tackle Covid-19 pandemic||Thirty-seven countries and the World Health Organization (WHO) appealed on Friday for common ownership of vaccines, medicines and diagnostic tools to tackle the global coronavirus pandemic, taking aim at patent laws they fear could become a barrier to sharing crucial supplies.While the push by mostly developing nations, called the Covid-19 Technology Access Pool, won praise from groups including Doctors Without Borders, a drug industry alliance questioned if the effort to pool intellectual property would really broaden access to medicines.Developing and some small nations fear rich countries pumping resources into finding vaccines - more than 100 are in development - will muscle their way to the front of the queue, once a candidate succeeds. “Vaccines, tests, diagnostics, treatments and other key tools in the coronavirus response must be made universally available as global public goods,” said Costa Rica President Carlos Alvarado. The effort, originally proposed in March, aims to provide a one-stop shop for scientific knowledge, data and intellectual property amid a pandemic that has infected more than 5.8 million people and killed more than 360,000.The WHO issued a “Solidarity Call to Action”, asking other stakeholders to join the voluntary push.“WHO recognises the important role that patents play in fuelling innovation but this is a time when people must take priority,” WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told an online news briefing.The International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & Associations raised concerns about undermining intellectual property protections, which the group said already enable collaboration and will also be needed after the pandemic is over.“The ‘Solidarity Call to Action’ promotes a one-size-fits all model that disregards the specific circumstances of each situation, each product and each country,” the federation said.Anna Marriott, health policy manager for anti-poverty group Oxfam, said the divide over how to handle patents illustrated how some regions could wind up losers.“The pharmaceutical industry’s attempt to rubbish the World Health Organisation’s initiative suggests they care more for profits than people’s health,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-37-nations-launch-alliance-to-share-tools-to-tackle-covid-19-pandemic/story-jJtVwdYqeam8BWmxUhyblK.html
30-05-2020||India||Odisha mining revenue shrinks amid lockdown by two-thirds in 2 months||Odisha’s mining revenue has gone down by two-thirds in the last two months compared to what it was during the same period a year ago, underscoring the economic slowdown that the state is likely to face in 2020-21 fiscal.Officials in the mining department said between April 1 and May 30, Odisha’s earning from mining was just about Rs 667 crore, about one-third than the same period of 2019-20 fiscal. Director of mining department, Deepak Mohanty said the decline in production and dispatch during lockdown has led to the decrease in mining revenue in the last 2 months.“As the fear of coronavirus still persists in the minds of workers, mining companies could not deploy workers even though mining is among the sectors that got relaxation during lockdown. The end user industries like steel companies and sponge iron industries too slowed down manufacturing in this period. The transporters of the minerals too could not get enough trucks and labourers that contributed to decline in the entire mining operations,” Mohanty said.A large portion of the Rs 667 crore revenue that the state earned during the last 2 months was from royalty on ores.Though relaxations have been given to the mining sector in successive lockdowns, Odisha’s hopes of earning more revenue from the 21 mines that were auctioned 3 months ago, would have to wait at least a month before any operation can start. The 21 iron ore, chromite and manganese ore mines that were auctioned with over 105 per cent premium during the bidding, need to get a vesting order from the state mines department before starting operation.“As the steel and mines department was not operative for a large part of the lockdown period, the new leaseholders had to wait for necessary approvals. Now that we have opened, we hope to give the leaseholders the necessary vesting orders within a month,” Mohanty said.Early this year, there were record bids to 21 merchant blocks offered for online auctions. While JSW Steel won four iron ore mines, ArcelorMittal won the Thakurani mine, with a premium of 107 per cent. Jindal Steel & Power Ltd bagged the Guali mine after committing a premium of 144 per cent.But the Odisha government’s hopes of earning higher revenues from mining than what it got in 2019-20 may not happen as many merchant miners may not go for full-fledged mining due to lack of demands. In 2019-20, Odisha earned mining revenue of Rs 10,943 crore, which constituted a bulk of its non-tax revenue. Despite the slowdown in economy, Odisha hoped to grow in the range of 7 per cent to 7.5 per cent during 2020-21. However, it is likely to be drastically revised as the mining sector would not grow as much despite the auction of 21 mines.“Many of the merchant miners are sitting on huge inventory of ore and they don’t have any idea how to dispose of the stockpile. As the demand for steel would be down in a recessionary economy, there is little likelihood of increased production of ores. So that would bring down the royalty earning for the government,” said Rajiv Lochan Mohanty, vice-president of the Eastern Zonal Mining Association.The lack of demand from end-users is also likely to affect employment in the mining sector. “The new merchant miners will use more automation in their operations affecting employment. The existing staff in mining companies may see salary cuts so that the companies stay afloat in a recession-hit market,” said a mining department official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-mining-revenue-shrinks-amid-lockdown-by-two-thirds-in-2-months/story-xxKUifhmO5kC03XHOcnJyJ.html

30-05-2020||India||Covid latest: Maharashtra records 2,940 new cases, 99 deaths; 51% fatalities in a fortnight||Maharashtra on Saturday recorded 2,940 new Covid-19 cases, the second highest single-day spike, to cross a grim landmark of 65,000 cases with the tally reaching 65,168, including 34,881 active cases representing 53.52% of all the infections registered in the state.The state also reported 99 new deaths, the third-highest for a single day due to the disease, driving the casualty figure up to 2,197.More than half of Maharashtra’s new cases reported on Saturday were from Mumbai --1,510 new cases. The metro city has now recorded 38,442 Covid cases, of which 20,845 are active. Mumbai’s highest single-day spike was registered on May 22, with 1,751 cases.On Friday, the state had recorded 116 fatalities, highest so far. However, the government had clarified that 70 of them had died over the last 13 days but their test reports confirming the infection were only released on Friday. Of the 99 new fatalities, 54 are in Mumbai, seven each in Vasai Virar and Panvel, six each in Thane, Pune and Solapur, three each in Raigad and Jalgaon, two each in Navi Mumbai and Kalyan Dombivli and one in Nagpur. Also, two patients, one each from Bihar and Rajasthan, died in Mumbai and Panvel respectively. 48 of the deceased were above 60 years of age, while 49 were aged between 40 and 59 years and the remaining two were below the age of 40 years. 66 dying patients also had high-risk co-morbidities, including diabetes, hypertension and heart ailments, as per the health officials.With the rise in fresh cases, the number of deaths has also risen by 1,129 in the last 15 days, more than 51% of total fatalities--2197-- in the state. For Coronavirus Live UpdatesAs on May 29, the state’s mortality rate had increased slightly to 3.37% from 3.27% on May 26 compared to the current national mortality rate of 2.86%. However, the mortality rate has shown a significant decline from the last month. On April 13, Maharashtra’s mortality rate was 7.41%.A senior official who did not wish to be named claimed that the state had found 11 mutants of the coronavirus, which was behaving differently in different patients.“Actually, we know nothing about the coronavirus. All we know is that it is extremely infectious and spreads very fast. The virus is behaving differently and is also mutating. We have found 11 mutants of the virus recently,” the official said.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19State health minister Rajesh Tope said that 83% of the total coronavirus patients were asymptomatic and only 15-16% patients have mild or moderate symptoms and only 1.5% patients are on ventilator. Overall the situation is under control and there is nothing to worry about, he said.However, the rapidly rising graph of Maharashtra cases pose a challenge; data shows that 84.14% of the state’s total 65,168 cases, which in number translates to 54,836 cases, were reported in the last 30 days—an average of 1,827 cases daily. Since the last 13 days, the state has recorded over 2000 cases every day except on May 24, when it shot up to 3041, which was the highest single-day spike at the time. In comparison, only 10,201 cases were registered in the state in the month of April. To put the steep hike in further perspective, one should consider that the state’s first coronavirus case was reported on March 9 and it took 30 days for the figure to cross the 1,000 mark.The health minister said the availability of beds in Mumbai was a bit of an issue which will be resolved in the coming days with the addition of 12,000 beds at 53 major private hospitals taken over by the state.“In addition, 7,000 beds will be available after new field hospitals at Goregaon, Mahalaxmi race course, Mulund, Dahisar and Richardson and Cruddas Company at Byculla become functional in the next few days,” he added.Despite the steep hike seen recently, Tope said the state’s doubling rate of the cases had increased to 17.5 days from 11.5 days till last week.The number of recoveries in the state has also jumped to 28,081 with the recovery of 1,084 patients on Saturday. In percentage terms, it stands at 43.07%, said a health official.The health department said it had so far conducted 4,47,772 tests for Covid-19 at various public and private facilities across Maharashtra.State currently has 3,169 active containment zones and a total of 17,917 survey teams that have screened more than 68.51 lakh people. So far, 35,420 people have been kept in institutional quarantine in the state and over 5,51,660 people have been put under home quarantine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-latest-maharashtra-records-2-940-new-cases-99-deaths-51-fatalities-in-a-fortnight/story-Z2aRRhVnoxvDwnNWtzPwUM.html
30-05-2020||India||Back in home state, but still a long wait for home||PATNA:On a scorching hot May day, four-year-old Bittu is sitting on his mother’s lap while his siblings – seven-year-old Anchal and 10-year-old Uday, play some distance away, unperturbed about where they are or what circumstances landed them there.On the other side of the room, the children’s father, Santosh Kumar Prasad, joins two other friends from his village, Karan Kumar and Santosh Kumar Ram, to plead with a group of government officials to let them leave the building and go home to their village, 15km away. But their request is turned down.They are all part of a group of 10 people from Agra who arrived in Patna on May 13 by a Shramik special train and were quarantined at the Radiant School on Danapur-Khagaul road in Patna. Their two-week Covid quarantine finished on May 27, and they are eager to get back to their village of Patlapur.They worked in carpet factories in Agra but say they hope to never go back. “Life was a struggle during lockdown when everything closed down. After the special trains started, we managed to reach here, but only to land up at the quarantine centre,” said Prasad.Located on the outskirts of Patna, the quarantine centre is in much better shape than those in rural areas because the possibility of inspections or sudden visits by top officials or politicians is higher. Residents of the centre say the proximity to the seat of power helps in getting their demands of food and basic amenities heard..But the confinement is getting to them. “Corona will not kill us. We have seen enough of struggle all our life. Our sweat will drain it out, but there was so much talk about it that we also got concerned about our family,” said Ram.The centre is housed in a two-storey building inside a sprawling school campus. Nine big rooms on both floors are used for the migrant workers with makeshift partitions for separate families. There are cots available, as are mosquito nets. Open areas such as verandahs contain fans, chairs and benches.A government official, who did want to be identified, said the quarantine centre was one of the best -managed ones. “Being a private school building cut off from the main road, it has enough space. We had around 150 persons, but now 90 remain. Others were allowed to go after completing their 14-day quarantine. More will be let go,” he said.There have been some complaints of poor-quality food and lack of supplies, but the official dismisses them. “With everyone having a mobile phone, even one burnt chapatti out of 500 can get us in trouble if it goes viral,” said another official on condition of anonymity.No outsider is allowed to enter the premises. Security personnel man the front gate in shifts, and have separate places to stay and eat inside the building. There is an earmarked corridor for migrants to talk to the authorities about any health concerns, from a distance.Three meals are arranged every day, and though the government has fixed a menu, supply constraints force officials to make changes. The workers are given chapati, puri, rice, pulse, tea and biscuits. Officials said they also provided milk to the children.2Usually, every block has two or three quarantine centres. When workers come, their names are registered with their identity documents and mobile phone number. At better-equipped quarantine centres, there is a general health checkup. Elsewhere in rural areas, doctors visit if those having health issues, while serious cases are referred to hospitals. The government has announced health screening of all those staying at quarantine centres. When they leave after the mandatory quarantine period, they have to sign out to receive ₹1,500 per person as travel assistance in their bank accounts, by the Bihar government to accounts linked with Aadhaar numbers.On average, the government spends Rs 2,400 per worker to provide a lungi, dhoti, saree, mat, sheets, mosquito net, bucket, jug, sanitary napkins, soap, toothbrush, comb, shampoo, hair oil, a small mirror and food at the centre, said the first official.Since the lockdown began on March 25, Bihar has received 2.5 million migrant workers – 1.5 million by trains and one million by road -- and built 13,000 quarantine centres to house them. Unlike the Radiant School centre, many of these facilities face flak for allegedly poor arrangements made for the workers.On May 27, violent protests broke out in Nalanda after poor-quality food was allegedly served to the migrants. On May 14, 88 workers at a quarantine centre in Banka district protested against the food provided to them.On May 21, workers blocked the road in Khagaria over a lack of basic toilet facilities at the local quarantine centre.Bihar disaster management principal secretary Pratyaya Amrit said that the massive migrant evacuation exercise was the biggest Bihar had ever witnessed.“At present around 13,600 block quarantine centres are running. Of nearly 14 lakh people staying there, more than half have completed their quarantine period and returned. Things have been constantly improved, as chief minister Nitish Kumar has clearly said that after all the ordeal the migrants faced, they needed to be taken care of in all possible ways to keep them as well as others safe,” he added.3Back at the Patna centre, the workers say their primary worry is not the quality of facilities but the date on which they would be allowed to go home. Some say they will welcome a temperature screening or Covid swab test if it means going home quicker.“We have got a lot, but the biggest thing is that we have returned to our state. The government has provided us things we need. Yet, it cannot be home. There has been no medical screening or test. We don’t have any problem. Had tests been done, we would have been able to reach home,” said Sanchit Kumar, who came from Punjab.The 33-year-old worker spent Rs 4,000 – out of his monthly salary of Rs 18,000 -- to hire a private vehicle with seven other men. He says he is worried about his wife and six children who are in the village, and, for their sake, wouldn’t go back to Punjab.He is not alone. Jaiveer Kumar and Pankaj Kumar, who both worked in Punjab, say they are determined to stay in their village even if the pay is lower than jobs in other states would pay.“There is no point going outside. We have seen it all. We will do something - big or small – here only. If we can work outside, why cannot we work here? We hope the government does something concrete for us,” said Pankaj.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/back-in-home-state-but-still-a-long-wait-for-home/story-BLPEtuzNshRLMU8BUsW8PI.html
30-05-2020||India||Uttarakhand seeks Central funds for mid-day meals during summer vacations||The Uttarakhand government has sought additional funds of Rs 1,298 lakh from the Centre to supply mid-day meals during the summer vacations after exhausting funds given by the Union government in giving food security allowance to students during the lockdown.R Meenakshi Sundaram, secretary for school education in the state on May 5, had written to the joint secretary of department of elementary education and literacy, in the Union Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD); requesting “central assistance to supply mid-day meal during summer vacations of year 2020.”The letter states that as per the orders of MHRD of April 29, 2020 regarding necessary actions to provide hot cooked meals or food security allowance to the eligible children during summer vacations 2020-21, “it is therefore, requested that food grains, cooking cost and transport assistance may please be released to the state…”The state government demanded 2494.953 metric tonnes of food grains, Rs 1239.56 lakh as cooking cost and Rs 58.6 lakh as transport assistance. Uttarakhand gives mid-day meal to total 6,89,437 students of which 4,05,009 students are in primary section and 2,84,428 students are in upper primary section. The state government has made the demands for 30 working days that fall under the summer vacation time period of May 27-June 30.So far, every student was being given the per student cooking cost and food grains as schools have been closed in the state since March 13, owing to lockdown due to stop the spread of Covid-19. The cooking cost per student amounts to around Rs 4 for primary section and Rs 7 for upper primary section. Along with this, students from primary section are given 100 grams of rice and 150 grams of rice for middle school.In the month of March, all students were given food security allowance by the state government. However, in April and May, 5,51,550 or approximately 80% students (of who are eligible for mid-day meal) were given the food security allowance.When quizzed about the rest of the 20% students, Mukul Kumar Sati, additional state project director for Samagra Siksha Abhiyan said that the state usually receives funds for only 80% students for mid-day meal.“We usually get 80% of the total funds under the mid-day meal scheme as it is assumed that 20% students will not turn up at the schools. The funds for mid-day meal are shared in a ratio of 9:1 by Centre and state government. Now, whatever money was given to us by the Central government has already been distributed to among the students,” said Sati.He added that the state government is awaiting response from the Centre on the excess funds that it has demanded.He further said that the number of students who have received food security allowance in the month of April and May are lesser than March as enrolment has not increased in the new session.“New students are enrolled in the month of April every year, which did not happen this year given the nationwide lockdown. Due to this there are no students enrolled with the education department for class 1 and class 6 (the standards which witness new admissions),” added Sati.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-seeks-central-funds-for-mid-day-meals-during-summer-vacations/story-IhNfTaphU12FVpMl0CZ67O.html

30-05-2020||India||Punjab extends lockdown till June 30||Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Saturday announced the extension of the coronavirus lockdown till June 30.Though experts have advised against opening of hospitality services and shopping malls in the state, the chief minister said his government will take into account the Centre’s guidelines for lockdown 5.0.  The Centre on Saturday issued fresh guidelines relaxing the nationwide lockdown, the fourth phase of which ends on May 31.The countrywide lockdown in containment zones has been extended till June 30, while hospitality services, hotels and shopping malls will be allowed to open from June 8, the Union home ministry said. Singh announced his decision after an on-ground assessment of the Covid situation through a video conference with health experts and cabinet ministers Bharat Bhushan Ashu, Balbir Singh Sidhu and Tript Singh Bajwa, according to a government release.During his weekly Facebook live session, the chief minister said the threat of Covid-19 was not over yet and if necessary, he would continue to take tough measures to save the lives of people. Underlining the need to exercise extreme caution, he lauded citizens for following all health norms to help the state government in containing the spread of the disease to a great extent. He directed Bharat Bhushan Ashu to ensure distribution of face masks along with ration kits among the needy and poor.Director General of Police Dinkar Gupta said wearing masks was being strictly enforced across districts and so far more than Rs 1 crore fine has been collected from offenders. During the meeting, the chief minister sought an update on the state government’s plan for deployment of Covid-19 foot soldiers to track and trace infections. Asha workers are being hired to undertake door to door surveillance across districts and they will be paid Rs 2 per head for every household surveyed, he said. The state government will also launch a mobile application to trace symptomatic cases who are not self-reporting to health authorities.In his Facebook session, the chief minister said people not reporting to health authorities was a big challenge as it complicated their contact tracing and endangered lives of others. Though there is an overall decline in the number of cases being reported daily, the fresh cases in the last few days are a matter of concern, he added. Singh said 36,820 people have been fined for not wearing masks and 4,032 persons for spitting in public from May 17 to May 28. Regarding rapid testing kits, Singh said those received by the state from China and South Korea had to be returned as they were defective. On the crackdown on units manufacturing spurious liquor during the lockdown, the chief minister said 97 illegal ‘bhattas’ had been sealed, with 1,729 FIRs registered and 1,360 persons arrested. The government was also taking stern action against those trying to smuggle liquor into Punjab, he added. On the locust threat, he said all arrangements had been put in place in seven districts bordering Rajasthan and Haryana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-extends-lockdown-till-june-30/story-VCRTClYE9lrUYdJZ959fhL.html

The Indians crossed the international border on Friday and Saturday from Sharda Barrage at border town of Banbasa in Champawat, they said.Champawat district magistrate SN Pandey said 437 Indians were stuck in western Nepal due to the coronavirus outbreak that prompted both the countries to seal their borders.“They were not able to return due to sealing of borders amid the pandemic. They were finally able to return on Friday and Saturday. The returnees include both tourists as well as labourers from Himachal Pradesh, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand,” said Pandey.“The labourers work in construction sites, brick kilns and sugar factories in Nepal. They were stuck there after the lockdown was announced,” the district magistrate said.He also said Nepal has fixed a period of four hours from 6 am to 10 am daily for opening of the border to enable Indians and Nepalese people to return to their countries.“Nepalese stranded in India were allowed to cross the border from time to time during the lockdown but Indians stuck in Nepal were allowed for the first time on Friday to enter Indian side after high-level talks were held between officials of both the nations,” said Pandey.So far, 6,534 Nepalese people had returned to their country, he said.

30-05-2020||India||In Bengal, malls, eateries and offices to reopen outside ‘affected area’ from June 1||The West Bengal government on Saturday decided to extend the lockdown till June 15 only in the “affected areas” within containment zones, allowing greater relaxation in all other areas, hours after the Union Home Ministry extended the nationwide lockdown till June 30 and issued guidelines for this duration.Among the relaxations are allowing shopping malls and restaurants to open and allowing the entertainment industry to start shooting from June 1. All offices and industrial activities can take place with 100% workforce beyond the “containment areas”. The Mamata Banerjee-led government had earlier divided the containment zones in three areas – A is the affected area, B is the buffer zone and C is the clean area. From June 1, the lockdown will be enforced only in containment zone ‘A’, while containment zones ‘B’ and ‘C’ will have similar relaxations. The basis of such area division within containment zones has been polling booths in order to reduce the size of the area under lockdown.“It is necessary to continue to implement the lockdown in the affected areas (containment zones) to contain the spread of Covid-19 and simultaneously open up activities in other areas for socio economic revival,” the government notification issued by the chief secretary on May 30 said.The order said that strict lockdown will be imposed in the ‘affected area’ with no relaxations.

No passengers will be allowed to travel standing and all passengers must wear masks and gloves.While the union ministry of home affairs has allowed opening of religious places from June 8, Bengal has allowed it from June 1 with not more than 10 people gathering at a time.Indoor and outdoor activities related to TV and cinema production, except for reality shows, including those for web-portal and OTT platforms, have been allowed with not more than 35 people per unit at a time from June 1. Restaurants and shopping malls will be allowed to open from June 1. Government offices will function with 70% of the workforce on rotational basis. While the government said it encouraged private offices to adopt work from home, the number of staff in offices will be decided by the companies themselves.“Norms of social distancing and health hygiene protocol must be strictly followed. Management committees, trustee boards, governing bodies, and owners and private institutions, organisations and establishments shall be responsible for compliance of the states norms and guidelines,” the notification said.The notification also said that any violation in compliance of norms of social distancing, health protocol and wearing of masks may lead to withdrawal of relaxation provided and may also attract penal action.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-bengal-malls-eateries-and-offices-to-reopen-outside-affected-area-from-june-1/story-D2aZOSXeia0Ekqn4zS8tCL.html

Announcing the decision during his weekly Facebook live session, the Punjab chief minister said that Covid-19 wasn’t ending any time soon and if necessary, he would take tough measures to save the lives of people, news agency PTI reports. The decision to extend the lockdown by another four weeks was taken after an on-ground assessment of the Covid-19 situtation through a video conference with health experts and cabinet ministers Bharat Bhushan Ashu, Balbir Singh Sidhu and Tript Singh Bajwa, PTI reported quoting a Punjab government release. Capt Amarinder Singh also urged people to inculcate the habit of washing hands, wearing masks and observing social distancing during the FB session. With 36 new Covid-19 cases, the total number of cases in Punjab rose to 2,233 on Saturday, according to the state’s health bulletin. Two deaths were also reported on Saturday, taking the toll to 44.

The agriculture department officials have also been directed to use fire engines for large-scale spraying of the pesticides.Agricultural scientists believe an adult desert locust can consume roughly its own weight, about 2 gram food every day. A one square km swarm of 40 million locusts could eat the same amount of food in one day as about 35,000 people. This is based on a person eating an average of 2.3 kg of food per day.Deputy director, agriculture, Anil Kumar Jha said that standing crops of moong, maize and vegetable could suffer extensive damages, if swarms of locusts entered Bihar. “Locusts settle down in a particular area in the evening and fly away in the morning. Such areas shall be identified for spraying of pesticides,” said Jha, adding that a toll-free number has also been operationalised to keep the officials in touch with farmers in case of the emergency.Locust attacks have been reported from Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra besides Uttar Pradesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-cancels-leaves-of-agriculture-dept-employees-to-combat-locust-threat/story-bLYZ4bFi5syiu6JoeZ6aGO.html

30-05-2020||India||ICMR asks states to do sero-survey in high-risk populations to assess exposure to Covid-19||The apex health research body, ICMR, has advised states to conduct sero-survey to assess the proportion of population including asymptomatic individuals exposed to coronavirus infection. A sero-survey involves testing of blood serum of a group of individuals for the presence of antibodies against that infection to know who has been infected in the past and has now recovered. Depending upon the level of sero-prevalence of infection, appropriate public health interventions can be planned and implemented for prevention and control of the disease, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said. The health research body has suggested that the blood serum samples of high risk or vulnerable populations like health care workers, frontline workers, immune-compromised individuals, individuals in containment zones, police personnel among others should be tested for COVID-19 antibodies. The ICMR is simultaneously is conducting a sero-survey to estimate the prevalence of community transmission of the infection among the Indian population. People from 70 districts will be tested for COVID-19 at random to check whether they have developed antibodies against the infection even though they remained asymptomatic, an ICMR official said. “The findings could be released by next week end,” he said. In its advice to the states, the ICMR said periodic sero-surveys are useful to guide the policy makers and stressed that IgG ELISA test should be used for carrying out such surveys. Antibodies generally start appearing after two weeks of onset of infection, once the individual has recovered, and last for several months. “Therefore, the IgG test is not useful for detecting acute infection but indicates episode of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the past. “The RT-PCR test is considered gold standard frontline test for clinical diagnosis of COVID19. The test is useful only when performed in the acute stage of infection (< 7 days). For several viral infections, antibody tests are useful for disease detection after 5–7 days of illness,” the body said in statement. In an attempt to decide the future course of action against the pandemic, ICMR has communicated a detailed plan to all the states to measure coronavirus exposure in general population as well as in high-risk populations. “Such sero-survey will guide appropriate public health intervention,” it said. The ICMR listed immuno-compromised patients like people living with HIV, patients on immuno-suppressive treatment, SARI, patients on dialysis among others and individuals in containment zones and buffer zones and healthcare workers be considered for testing. Security personnel, police personnel and volunteers involved in duties facing a large number of individuals or those coming in contact with potentially infected individuals, fomites or places should be tested for the presence of antibodies against the coronavirus infection. Besides, the ICMR has also suggested testing press reporters, migrant workers who have travelled back from urban and peri-urban areas to rural, tribal, hard to reach areas in the country as well as natives after coming in contact with returned migrants, industrial workers or labour force, farmers, vendors visiting large markets, municipal staff working in areas like sanitation, water supply, electricity, etc. where interactions with citizens is expected. Drivers of hospital ambulances, hearse, buses, auto, taxies, etc. who have been on work facing a large number of individuals, bus conductors, cleaners and helping staff also should be included, it said. People working in banks, couriers, telecom offices, shop, air travel related staff, all members of overseas operations and people staying or working in slums with very high population density with poorly ventilated buildings, those staying in institutional settings like old age homes, orphanage, asylums, shelters for homeless, hostels and prisons should be considered for testing. The sero-survey would be conducted using an IgG ELISA kit. Scientists at ICMR-National Institute of Virology, Pune have developed and validated an indigenous IgG ELISA test for antibody detection for SARS-CoV-2. The test has undergone intense validation in three stages and has been found to have high sensitivity and specificity, the ICMR said. To fast track production and increase availability of the IgG ELISA test, ICMR has transferred this technology to many pharma companies like Zydus Cadila, J Mitra and Company, Meril Diagnostics, Voxtur Bio, Trivitron Healthcare, Karwah Enterprises, Avecon Healthcare, etc. The technology has been transferred to various entities without exclusivity clause and therefore can be further shared with others as per demand and capability, the health research body said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/icmr-asks-states-to-do-sero-survey-in-high-risk-populations-to-assess-exposure-to-covid-19/story-xovsuJBdfrP4MUJ4d06L8O.html

30-05-2020||India||In Unlock 1, re-opening of economic activities except in containment zones||The Centre on Sunday issued guidelines for re-opening all the activities in a phased manner from June 1 with a view to return to normalcy, more than two months after first nationwide lockdown was announced to contain the spread of Covid-19 infection.The containment zones, however, will continue to be under strict lockdown with only essential services allowed there and movement of people restricted.Key activities to resume from the second week of June include hotels, shopping malls and dine-in facilities in restaurants, which were closed since March 24. However, international flights, metro rail, cinema halls, gymnasiums, swimming pools, entertainment parks, theatres, bars and auditoriums, assembly halls and similar places as well as any kind of social, political, sports, entertainment, cultural, academic or religious function with large congregations will continue to be banned for the time being. A decision on these activities will be taken at a later stage.The new guidelines for phased re-opening of areas outside the containment zones – termed “Unlock-1” by the ministry of home affairs – have been issued after extensive consultations with states and union territories. Home minister Amit Shah fronted the discussions with chief ministers on Thursday. He then met Prime Minister Narendra Modi, informing him about the inputs from various CMs. The lockdown 4.0, which was announced on May 17, ends on Sunday.With an “economic focus”, the MHA order said, “all activities that were prohibited earlier will be opened up in areas outside Containment Zones in a phased manner”.However, the Centre has left the decision on the states to prohibit certain activities outside the containment zones if they want, based on their assessment.The Centre has claimed that there shall be no restriction on inter-state and intra-state movement of persons and goods. Also, no separate permission or approval or any e-permit will be required for such movements. The offices – government and private – have been told to encourage work from home (WFH) as far as possible.To stop inter-state movement, states will have to give ‘wide publicity’ in advance so that people are not stuck at borders. The regular passenger trains, Shramik Specials and movement of Indians stranded abroad will continue, according to existing guidelines issued earlier this month.Timing of night curfew – has been revised from earlier 7 pm to 7 am, to 9 pm to 5 am now, to ensure people have more flexibility in going to their workplaces or carrying out any other economic activity.The activities allowed in phase one are religious places and places of worship, hotels, restaurants and other hospitality services as well as shopping malls, which can reopen from June 8. The health ministry will soon issue SOPs (standard operating protocols) for the same. Similarly, a decision will be taken in July to re-open schools, colleges and other educational institutions after consultations with states and union territories as part of phase two.

30-05-2020||India||People with mental health disorders at risk of infections during outbreaks, experts say||In epidemic situations such as the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak, people with mental health disorders are susceptible to infection that can be attributed to cognitive impairment, low-risk awareness and decreased personal protection efforts among patients, along with constraints in accessing regular healthcare, experts say.According to the Global Burden of Disease study, one in seven Indians, or 197 million, are affected by mental disorders, and their contribution to the overall disease burden has doubled from 2.5% to 4.7% over the last two decades.High susceptibility to stress worsens the existing mental health condition.“As a result of prolonged lockdown restrictions, in the latter half of this year, we can see several outbreaks of secondary epidemics such as stress-related disorder. In the current situation, the world is desperately trying to build enough beds to treat Covid-19 patients. Sadly, not much is being done in creating any sort of protection tents of psychological and social welfare to avert the crisis,” said Prafulla Shriyan, research fellow, Indian Institute of Public Health, Bengaluru.In General populationDespite knowledge of human coronaviruses, the new Covid-19 strain has created panic among the general public because of its widespread transmission across the globe. Various alarming video clippings of Covid-19 are accessible to all individuals in developing countries via their smartphones and computers.The use of physical control measures such as physical distancing, home quarantine, closure of schools, and workplaces are leading to disruption of social support networks. Sudden change in social circumstances and increased stress induce recurrence of already cured mental health problems in patients.Phobia related to isolation/quarantinePeople in quarantine are likely to develop psychological symptoms, emotional disturbance, depression, stress, irritability, and insomnia. These impacts will be higher when parents are quarantined along with their children.There are several reasons for stress, including fear of becoming sick, separation from the loved ones, loss of the loved ones, and financial hardship. Healthcare workers, children, and older people are at higher risk for long-term mental health problems.The deaths that occurred due to the pandemic are associated with severe psychological implications. Covid-19 is characterised by fear, anxiety, and grief. The reported suicidal cases show the number of suicidal deaths is high among older adults, as they are sensitive to isolation and are more dependent on social support.“In India, over 90 people fled from Covid-19 isolation wards, and more than 10 suicidal deaths were reported across states because of the social stigma attached to the disease and the fear of isolation. This creates panic about the disease and helps to spread it even further. People don’t want them to be labelled as infected and are fleeing from healthcare facilities wherever they are isolated or quarantined. Panic may also paralyse them with fear and these internal emotions progress to hopelessness and desperation,” said Dr. Giridhara R Babu, professor, Indian Institute of Public Health.Infected peopleInfected people experience high levels of stress, due to fear, uncertainty, financial anxiety, and limited interactions. “Symptomatic patients are more likely to experience anger, confusion, hopelessness, anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Isolating independent persons in a single room with limited movement and contact precautions can induce severe stress,” said Dr. Babu.An asymptomatic individual can also report distress, frustration, and fear due to long quarantine, perception of risk, and inadequate information.In childrenClosed schools due to prevailing lockdown restrictions have resulted in different kinds of mental health issues in children.“Disruption of daily routine causes children with special needs to feel frustrated and short-tempered. Nationwide school closures also increase the risk of exploitation, violence, and abuse due to interrupted social services and movement restrictions,” said Shriyan.Caregivers in most of countries subject children to homicidal practices. What if those kids couldn’t leave home, stay away from teachers, friends, or supportive services? Who will protect them? Millions of children have been addicted to digital technology. Now, how do we keep them safe from the risks and hazardous consequences of the internet?HealthcareHealthcare workers’ safety and psychological resilience are essential components of sustaining critical healthcare services throughout the epidemic. They are facing a greater risk of exposure, extreme workload, and a rapidly changing working environment due to the pandemic. It forces healthcare professionals in a challenging situation, attempting them to make tough decisions and work under immense pressure.Most people, especially the vulnerable are susceptible to mental healthcare issues due to the pandemic. “Along with Covid-19, there might be a surge in mental health issues due to the economic crisis, unemployment, poverty, and homelessness. Mental health services need to be prioritised by strengthening the existing healthcare system. Screening of people at high risk such as those with an earlier history of mental health and senior citizens along with an effective intervention to minimise adversities should be the top priority,” Shriyan added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/people-with-mental-health-disorders-at-risk-of-infections-during-outbreaks-experts-say/story-Nn0lBv74MuLHFiHORVv7FO.html

30-05-2020||India||Nobel laureate Abhijit Banerjee may have guided CM Mamata’s move to directly transfer money to Amphan-affected: Experts||West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s decision to directly transfer money to the bank accounts of around five lakh super cyclone Amphan-affected people might have been influenced and guided by Nobel laureate Dr. Abhijit Vinayak Banerjee, who heads the global advisory body set up by her to battle the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak, according to experts.On Friday, Banerjee had announced that Rs 20,000 would be transferred to the bank accounts of each of the five lakh families affected by the cyclone and even assured an additional Rs 28,000 to each family under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Generation Scheme (MNREGS). “Dr. Banerjee has been saying this for quite some time now. He had even suggested this to the Union government. The CM took his advice and implemented it. The Centre and other states will have to follow it, as this is the only way out,” said Tapas Roy, senior Trinamool Congress leader and minister of state for parliamentary affairs.The Indian-American economist, who won the 2019 Nobel Prize in Economics, along with Esther Duflo and Michael Kremer, had suggested that the Narendra Modi-led government should look at providing cash transfer to the bottom 60% of India’s population to help revive the economy, which has been battered by Covid-19.“Spending is the easiest way to revive the economy. It will have stimulus effect,” Dr. Banerjee had said during his recent conversation with former Congress president Rahul Gandhi amid the pandemic.The global advisory body, which Mamata Banerjee has set up to advise her government on how to fight the crisis triggered by the viral outbreak, has Dr. Banerjee as its head. Swarup Sarkar, former regional director of WHO (World Health Organisation); Tom Frieden, ex-CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the US); Jishnu Das, economist, World Bank; and JVR Prasad Rao, a former union health secretary, are among the other experts.“This is a very good initiative by the West Bengal government. People, who have been the hardest hit, will need cash in hand. Some economists, including Nobel laureate Dr. Banerjee, have been saying this. It seems the government may have taken Dr. Banerjee’s advice, as he is heading the global advisory body to battle the pandemic,” said Mousumi Dutta, head of the economics department at Presidency University in Kolkata.The opposition, however, has slammed the Bengal government over the initiative, claiming it had been cheating people and making false promises.“The Bengal government has made such promises in the past too such as giving dearness allowances to government employees. It was never given. Now, she knows that her government has failed in all aspects. She wants to give some money in a bid to win them over before the next year’s assembly polls. What will people do with the money if they die of Covid-19?” asked Rahul Sinha, national secretary, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).Dr. Banerjee had said the government should issue temporary ration cards for three to six months for every person who needs foodgrains. “Use those ration cards for transferring money, wheat, and rice to them,” he had said.The Bengal government announced a few days ago that those who have outdated paper ration cards are also eligible for ration items.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nobel-laureate-abhijit-banerjee-may-have-guided-cm-mamata-s-move-to-directly-transfer-money-to-amphan-affected-experts/story-tlLTwfPvxXeMIPTjaCluoN.html

The maximum of four fatalities were reported in the CISF and two each in the CRPF and BSF.The CAPFs or central paramilitary forces -- the Central Reserve Police Force, the Border Security Force, the Indo-Tibetan Border Police, the Central Industrial Security Force and the Sashastra Seema Bal -- have a combined strength of about 10 lakh personnel deployed for rendering a variety of internal security duties and border guarding.The Union home ministry, under whose command the paramilitary forces function, launched the ‘Bharat Ke Veer’ (BKV) fund in April 2017.It was created with an aim that common people who wish to pay tributes and make monetary contributions for CAPF men and women can do so in a streamlined manner.“A decision has been made by the home ministry that the family of a CAPF corona warrior who dies due to COVID-19 in the line of duty will be provided an amount of Rs 15 lakh in addition to the regular ex-gratia service amount.” “Their personal details and bank account links are being uploaded on the BKV website and the mobile app,” a senior official said.Contributions to the fund can be made through the BKV mobile app or through its official website www.bharatkeveer.gov.in.All contributions to this fund are exempt from income tax as per government rules.Earlier this month, PTI had reported that the CRPF had proposed to the government that a special grant of Rs 50 lakh could be provided to central paramilitary personnel who die due to COVID-19 while on duty.According to latest official data, these forces have reported over 1,340 coronavirus cases till date and now 430 personnel are under treatment.The counter-terrorist force National Security Guard (NSG) had detected one patient, who has now recovered.Two cases of the infection have been reported in the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), the federal contingency force said, adding that the patients are under treatment at the CAPFs referral hospital in Greater Noida.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rs-15-lakh-from-bharat-ke-veer-fund-to-kin-of-capf-coronavirus-casualty/story-JWqr5Q6uKGqf9U0viItDkM.html

Many cars were damaged as walls and trees fell on them. About 20 houses were damaged and a six year old girl died under the debris.A telecom tower fell in the Albatia area of the city and Agra–Bayana train track was blocked when trees fell on Malpura rail line.“There has been damage to the Taj Mahal’s premises due to rains and thunderstorm. Part of the marble railing at the back of the main mausoleum towards river Yamuna fell. A red sandstone railing fell on the floor. About ten trees on Taj Mahal premises also toppled,” said Ankit Namdev, the Archaeology Survey of India’s Conservation Assistant at the Taj Mahal.“The wooden main gate has tilted because of the thrust of high speed winds which uprooted the false ceiling outside the monument and damaged a turnstile gate at Taj Mahal. Repair work is to be undertaken after assessment of losses,” Namdev said.It is not the first time that Taj has faced damages due to thunderstorms. On April 11 and May 2, 2018, there were similar damages because of thunderstorms.A six year old girl died in Nagla Karan Singh of Agra in Friday’s storm after the house collapsed, trapping her in the debris. A villager identified as Kailashi from village Marhi in Doki area of Agra district and Ram Shankar Kanhiyya from Fatehabad town also lost their lives.The wind uprooted trees, poles and tin roofs all over city and rural areas.

30-05-2020||India||‘Making daughter-in-law do house work not unusual’: Kerala High Court||Pushing a daughter-in-law to do household chores is “not something unusual”, the Kerala High Court observed last week, allowing a plea for divorce filed by a man against his wife. The woman had refused to live with the man citing ill-treatment by the mother-in-law and exhorted him to move out with her, which the man presented in court as “cruelty”. “We do not find any other justifiable reason for her to get the petitioner’s mother excluded from the family or to be desirous of having a separate residence to the exclusion of her. The persistence of the respondent (wife) was unbearable for the petitioner,” the judgment authored by justice Mary Joseph noted.The woman, in turn, had submitted that her mother-in-law used to ill treat her physically and mentally to the extent that she made her do all domestic work even during the convalescent period after a surgical operation.“No family is totally devoid of clashes among members constituting it. It is common for elders to scold and sometimes abuse youngsters. Making a daughter-in-law do the household/domestic work is also not something unusual”, the bench, which also comprised justice AM Shaffique, noted in response to the wife’s argument.Also Watch: Man kills wife by letting loose a cobra while she slept, arrested The plea for divorce was set up by the husband in the family court in 2011 on the grounds of cruelty. The couple had married in 2003 and were parents to a girl child. The husband alleged that the wife had found pleasure in quarrelling with him and his mother. It was also submitted that she threatened to commit suicide after creating cogent materials to trap the husband and his mother.“She used to call the petitioner ‘dog’ and ‘shameless creature. She used to undermine his person stating that he is not a fit person to be her husband and insult him by beating him in front of his relatives. She also denied the petitioner sex,” it was alleged.The woman moved out of the house in February 2011.She, however, opposed the plea for divorce, raising counter allegations of cruelty at the hands of her mother-in-law. It was alleged that on the advice of the mother-in-law, the husband started ill treating her.The family court ruled in favour of the woman in January 2014 and denied the husband’s petition for divorce which led to the appeal in the high court.The high court took note of the submissions made by the wife as per which she expressed willingness to live with the husband only if her mother-in-law does not live in the same house.“The respondent was very particular to have a more comfortable and happy life to the exclusion of the petitioner’s mother, who according to her was the root cause for problems to originate in her matrimonial life,” the court said.The court also noted that the husband was not a drunkard during the initial days of marriage, but he turned to alcohol after the relationship with the wife hit the rough patch.“In the case on hand the petitioner’s turning to be a drunkard can only be taken as the natural outcome of the pressure exerted on him by the respondent to have a separate residence to the exclusion of the petitioner’s mother,” the bench stated.The court, therefore, allowed the husband’s plea and set aside the judgment of family court.“Evidence indicates that the respondent and the petitioner’s mother were not cordial and clashes were frequent. Therefore, it is natural for the petitioner to be a scapegoat of the indifferences. The torture suffered by him amidst the respondent and his mother was of much gravity and something unbearable for him,” the court said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/making-daughter-in-law-do-house-work-not-unusual-kerala-high-court/story-TZlPUyuGXlvLf93XXidw0M.html
30-05-2020||India||Coming soon: Indian National Supermodel to predict the future of coronavirus spread||The Indian government’s department of science and technology (DST) has begun work on the creation of a Covid -19 Indian National Supermodel which will forecast the coronavirus spread and also monitor the future transmission of infection with the aim to assist governments in decisions involving readiness of the national health systems and other mitigation measures.An official statement from the ministry of science and technology on Saturday said that there was a need for a robust forecasting model for predicting the spread of the disease and for enhancing disease surveillance measures.It added that while the government was monitoring and taking measures to control infectivity and mortality related to Sars-Cov-2, it was imperative to bring together the analytics harvested by the numerous mathematical models being developed for Covid-19 forecasting and surveillance with funding by DST-SERB (Science and Engineering Research Board) and other agencies.“Inspired by India’s history of using mathematical models for disaster management planning of metrological events, DST has initiated this exercise to pool in expertise in the field and create one model for the entire country that will be subjected to rigorous tests required for evidence-based forecasting, routinely practiced in weather forecasting communities,” the statement says.The announcement comes as India gallops towards another grim milestone of recording 200,000 positive cases of the disease with a tall of 173,763 cases on Saturday, and a new record being created on each of the past few days for the sharpest single-day spike in cases. Also Read: With highest single-day spike of 7,964 cases, India’s Covid-19 tally crosses 1.73 lakhAs per the statement the model in the works will rely only on the data that is relevant to Covid-19, and will also have a built-in component to adapt and learn from the newer data trends.“It will aggregate successful evidence-based mathematical and statistical forecasting models and include the best predictive analytics for robust forecasting of infectious disease spread,” the statement adds.The government of India has in the past used projections from some of these mathematical models to try and gauge the efficacy of several restrictive and containment measures taken by the government such as the lockdown and the testing strategy.The statement says that the new supermodel could be useful not only for policymakers in India but also around the world for the purpose of overcoming difficulties in predicting the rate of spread of infection and the likely burden it will put on the healthcare sector, which in turn will help governments curb the epidemic.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19The ministry says that Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research (JNCASR) and IISc, Bangalore have been tasked to co-ordinate and work with all Covid-19 modeling projects and programs in the country.“This will help develop a set of benchmarks to assess various models and to finally deliver the Covid-19 India National Supermodel. The Coordination team will consult and work with the research groups active in modeling, various software developers, and reputed companies to ensure delivery of a suitable user interface and software,” the statement added.JNCASR and IISc will also work in close coordination with a consultative committee that will receive critical inputs on technical aggregation, guidance, and final delivery of a robust supermodel, the statement claims.“Mathematical modeling and simulations for the spread of Covid-19 virus and its impact are not mere academic exercises but are critical needs for rational decision making, planning, and resource management. It is thus of vital importance that a robust National Model which is vetted by a large cross-section of the scientific community working in the area is developed,” said Prof Ashutosh Sharma, Secretary, DST.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coming-soon-indian-national-supermodel-to-predict-the-future-of-coronavirus-spread/story-3zF3pa6uhidneYhVJrZrgJ.html

We must understand that vaccine development is a very complex process. Shortest time taken for any vaccine is not less than 4 years,” Mazumdar-Shaw said.Trying to develop vaccine in less than a year is a very daunting and almost impossible task. Vaccine development involves a large number of processes to establish the safety, efficacy and endurance of the vaccine, she added.“We need to deal with this pandemic for the next few years before we really get a reliable vaccine... We need to invest much more in healthcare. If this pandemic has exposed one ugly truth about every country, not just India, it is about the appalling state of public and primary healthcare, appalling state of under investing in healthcare,” Mazumdar-Shaw said.Healthcare is a capital intensive sector, it is a skill intensive sector, it is a employment generation sector, she added.“There needs to be a very systematic data led approach to see how can we deal with the infection and keep people safe,” Mazumdar-Shaw said.This is one opportunity for us to invest in healthcare infrastructure, because this what will save India and the world, she added.In similar vein, Apollo Hospitals MD Suneeta Reddy said: “This pandemic has clearly shown us the need for medical infrastructure. There needs to be an investment in healthcare, not only in infrastructure but also in skilling”.Impetus given to the IT sector needs to be given to the healthcare sector to create additional infrastructure, she added.We hope the government considers healthcare as next IT sector, Reddy said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccine-to-prevent-covid-19-will-take-long-time-to-be-ready-kiran-mazumdar-shaw/story-5ygzOl14ntOOs1Do4cuo9M.html

She also pleaded that a video conference be arranged with him immediately so that the family could understand his condition, a close relative of Rao told Hindustan Times.ALSO READ | Elgar Parishad case: Court asks JJ Hospital to submit report on P Vara Vara Rao’s health“The court ordered the authorities of JJ Hospital to submit a report on the health condition of Rao and posted the case for further hearing on June 2,” he said.Hemalatha told reporters on Saturday morning that she had come to know from the local police in Chikkadpalli in Hyderabad at around 8.30 pm that Rao’s health condition was precarious and he had been moved to JJ Hospital, Mumbai from Taloja Jail.“The police told us that they got just one sentence information from Pune police and that there were no further details. After a lot of anxiety and enquiries for over three hours, we came to know that my husband had fallen unconscious on Thursday evening in jail and had been moved to the hospital and by Friday evening all vital parameters recorded were normal,” she said.Hemalatha added that there were also reports that he had been first admitted to Taloja hospital jail three days ago and only after his health worsened, he had been shifted to JJ Hospital. “We do not know how much truth is there in these conflicting reports,” she said.The family members were also worried over the statement by Telangana police officials that they would make arrangements for the family to visit Mumbai. “Right now, I am not in a position to travel to Mumbai as I am 72-years-old and am not in good health. I have been under severe stress for the last 18 months and particularly in the last 12-14 hours,” she said.She said if the court granted permission, her family members would go to Mumbai to visit him in hospital. “It is enough if the government gives permissions needed in the context of Covid-19 and we take care of our travel arrangements,” Hemalatha said.She demanded that her husband be released immediately on bail, as he had already undergone 18 months of incarceration on fabricated charges and without any trial.Stating that Rao already had pre-existing health issues like piles, prostate enlargement, coronary artery disease, oedema, hypertension, acidity, sinus and migraine, Hemalatha requested that a comprehensive medical examination should be initiated to find out the reason for his illness.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jailed-poet-vara-vara-rao-s-wife-moves-mumbai-court-demands-to-know-his-health-status/story-XPFIXE7vOFMMEsr79kHNsJ.html

Many people at the funeral are also said to have flouted medical advice on how to handle the body.This is the second such incident in the city in a month where relatives and friends of a deceased violated the protocol for handling the body during cremation. According to the health department of the Ulhasnagar Municipal Corporation the woman who was under treatment at the Central hospital died on May 25, and tested positive after her death.“While handling the body we had explained to the relatives the protocol which needs to be followed during the last rites. We had specially mentioned no one should touch the body’s cover while performing the rites,” an officer from the health department said.The UMC said the body was kept in a hall at Hira Ghat area where over 70 people including relatives and friends of the deceased showed up.“What we have learned is they opened the cover and also poured water on the body as a part of rituals which is not allowed,” said the officer.When the deceased’s report came positive and the civic body also learned about the violation at the funeral, they immediately quarantined around 50 people and collected their swabs for tests. Eighteen of them tested positive.Suhas Manholkar, chief health officer of UMC said, “We will register a case against the relatives for the violations. Meanwhile our team is also checking on more people from the area if they have any symptoms they will be tested.”Earlier on May 5, nine relatives of a 50-year-old man who also violated the protocol for cremation tested positive for Covid-19.

By comparison, the Liaoning, completed 10 sea trials in 13 months before being commissioned in September 2012. During construction and sea trials, the Shandong was known as the Type 001A; however, the December 2019 commissioning ceremony indicated that it is officially designated the Type 002,” the CSIS note added.“The Shandong sends a message not only to those regional powers attempting to check China’s plans to exercise hegemony inside the nine-dash line disputed area of the South China Sea, but also to the bigger global powers,” military expert James Maclaren wrote for the Diplomat website earlier this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-s-first-home-built-aircraft-carrier-begins-sea-trials-to-test-weapons/story-is8tC6hZzg1g5k5ozGkO5I.html
30-05-2020||India||Mann ki Baat: PM Narendra Modi expected to give glimpses of ‘Lockdown 5.0’ on Sunday||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address the nation through his ‘Mann ki Baat’ on Sunday, May 30 while the country prepares to transition from lockdown 4.0 to a new phase of lockdown. Lockdown 5.0 will need to address the dual challenges of giving impetus to the economy, which is flagging, by further boosting industrial activity and commerce and also strategically use restrictions to contain the rapid rise in coronavirus infections in India before it becomes a major challenge to the healthcare apparatus in the country.In the last Mann ki Baat address on April 26, the prime minister had said that the new habits inculcated to fight coronavirus, like wearing masks and public hygiene, will have to become part of our new reality and cautioned against complacency against the disease, which he said will impact everyone in the country sooner or later.Also Read: Modi’s ‘Mann ki Baat’ highlights: Wearing masks will become symbol of civilised society, says PMMore than a month has passed since the last Mann ki Baat address and the country has seen a gradual easing of restrictions in three subsequent lockdowns since the first announced on March 25 and the prime minister himself listed the resumption of economic activities as a co-priority along with saving lives from the global pandemic. In the interim, his government also announced the major chunk of over Rs 20,000 crore economic package to usher in reforms in most sectors including the agriculture, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), Defence, Non Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) etc under the Aatmanirbhar Bharat initiative.Tomorrow’s Mann ki Baat will also be the second message from the Prime Minister in two days after the release of a letter and an audio recording coinciding with the anniversary of his government’s second term on Saturday, which listed out government’s achievements and attributed some of the marquee decisions to PM’s bold leadership.Also Read: ‘A year of historic firsts for Indians’: PM Modi in letter to citizensHe said that instead of becoming a global liability with poor management of the pandemic, India’s handling of the crisis engendered by Covid-19 had set an example for the rest of the world since the country had not allowed the situation to spiral out of control as was evidenced in some developed countries in the west.He also acknowledged the impact, the disease and the resultant lockdown clamped to contain it, had on the most vulnerable sections of the society including labourers, migrant workers, hawkers and others daily wagers and said that care was needed to ensure that the inconveniences faced do not turn into disasters.“Hence, it is very important for every Indian to follow all rules and guidelines. We have displayed patience so far and we should continue to do so. This is one of the important reasons for India being safer and in a better state than many other countries,” he said in his letter.The prime minister’s Mann ki Baat message tomorrow will also come amidst a raging boundary row with China that has seen the Indian government express its commitment to defending the country’s sovereignty and integrity in the face of what it considers to be China’s attempts to dissuade New Delhi from creating infrastructure on its side of the long disputed Line of Actual Control (LAC).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mann-ki-baat-pm-narendra-modi-expected-to-give-glimpses-of-lockdown-5-0-on-sunday/story-hikgzhfSlky7xtJZrernhM.html
30-05-2020||India||Nobel laureate Peter Doherty concerned about lockdown relaxations in India||Nobel laureate Peter Charles Doherty has expressed concern about India and other densely-populated countries relaxing lockdown norms to limit the spread of coronavirus disease Covid-19. At the same time, he has also described a complete shutdown as “an economic and social impossibility”. Doherty, who is with the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at the Doherty Institute, University of Melbourne, won the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 1996 for his discovery of how the body’s immune system distinguishes virus-infected cells from normal ones.In an exclusive email interview with news agency PTI, he said that the number of coronavirus cases will rise. “If it was purely a matter of hard science, everywhere should stay locked down. But that’s pretty much an economic and social impossibility,” Doherty said.The expectation, he said, is the numbers will rise and limiting spread will depend on people acting responsibly and the capacity for rapid response and extensive contact testing. “And in a densely populated country like India I think that it will be very difficult,” the nobel laureate said. The number of Covid-19 cases in India has been rising rapidly and now stands at 173,763 including 4,971 deaths, according to the Union health ministry data on Saturday morning. A nationwide lockdown, imposed on March 25 to stop the spread of the coronavirus disease, has been extended thrice, with the fourth phase due to end on Sunday, May 31. However, the government has been gradually easing restrictions to re-start the economy. Doherty said there is no alternative to a lockdown, not “till we have effective vaccines.” “There is no other option other than closing borders. South Korea, for example, conducted massive, intensive testing and contact tracing in a wealthy country with a very disciplined population. Otherwise, not till we have effective vaccines.” However, he added that he personally doesn’t see the point of closing borders for people coming in if there’s already a high incidence of disease in the community, “unless it’s to avoid the need to care for them and use scarce hospital beds”. With no cure for the disease in sight yet, scientists and governments around the world are doubling down to develop a drug or a vaccine for Covid-19. Most, however, acknowledge that a vaccine may not be available before at least a year.Doherty, too, says that the earliest time frame for an effective vaccine “going into large numbers of people” is nine to 12 months.“If all goes well with testing, we could know if some of the candidate vaccines are both safe and effective as early as September/October. Then, rolling a vaccine out will depend on the type of product and how quickly it can be made, put in vials and so forth,” Doherty told PTI in an email interview from Melbourne. However, a front-running Covid-19 vaccine candidate being developed in China is expected to be available as soon as the end of this year, according to a report published in the official Wechat account of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission. The vaccine, jointly developed by the Beijing Institute of Biological Products and China National Biotec Group Co., has completed phase II testing and may be ready for the market at the end of this year or early next year, said the report.Doherty also warned against the use of anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) to treat Covid-19, and said current and planned trials of the anti-malaria drug should be stopped.“My understanding is that the use of the drug in severe disease is definitely contra-indicated, but it’s not yet clear whether, if taken under medical supervision, it could have some useful effect if taken early on, or as a preventive. Those trials just haven’t been done properly,” Doherty noted. However, earlier this week the Indian Council of Medical Research has said that no major side-effects of HCQ in studies done in India and its use can be continued in preventive treatment for Covid-19 under strict medical supervision. The ICMR’s statement had come against the backdrop of the World Health Organization (WHO) temporarily suspending the testing of the drug as a potential treatment for Covid-19 over safety concerns.US President Trump, too, has said that he took a two-week dose of hydroxychloroquine as a preventive drug after possible exposure to the coronavirus following two White House staffers testing positive. He also got India to lift the ban on the export of the drug some weeks ago. Another cure being tried out for Covid-19 is the plasma therapy. Asked whether plasma therapy can be an effective treatment for Covid-19, Doherty told PTI, “We lack good properly controlled trials but, especially if the plasma has been tested for antibody levels and there’s evidence of good activity, it could be helpful. If I had the disease and was offered plasma therapy I would certainly accept, but I would not take hydroxychloroquine.” Doherty is also very optimistic about herd immunity developing against the SARS-CoV-2 infection.“We think that (herd immunity) will cut in and have an obvious effect when, say, 60 per cent of people have been infected. Best hope is to boost herd immunity with a vaccine,” he stated.Herd immunity is a form of indirect protection from infectious disease that occurs when a large percentage of a population has become immune to an infection, whether through vaccination or previous infections.EOM||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nobel-laureate-peter-doherty-concerned-about-lockdown-relaxations-in-india/story-Ksyx8O2ppDeuwTpv0B2oYL.html

30-05-2020||India||Rahul Gandhi has ‘limited’ understanding about Covid-19: BJP chief JP Nadda||Slamming Rahul Gandhi for his criticism of the Modi government’s handling of the COVID-19 situation, BJP president J P Nadda said on Saturday that the Congress leader’s understanding of these issues is limited and that his statements are not aimed at addressing the crisis but are all about politics.Addressing a press conference on the first anniversary of Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government’s second term, Nadda said the last one year will be known for many bold decisions and its timely actions to deal with coronavirus have ensured that the situation remains in control in India when many big and powerful countries have found themselves “helpless”.The first year of the Modi government’s second term has been full of accomplishments and unimaginable challenges with the prime minister leading from the front and taking “bold and timely” decisions to combat COVID-19 crisis.Asked about Gandhi’s remark that the nation-wide lockdown has failed in its purpose, Nadda said, “Rahul Gandhi doesn’t understand these issues deeply. His understanding and study of issues is limited. That is why he makes confusing remarks by sometimes questioning the lockdown and sometimes demanding why it was not being extended.” His statements are for political ends and all about politics, and they have got nothing to do with addressing coronavirus issues, the BJP president said.He blamed the Congress for politicising the issue, and claimed that the BJP worked towards serving people during the crisis.Answering a question, Nadda asserted the government’s pitch for a self-reliant India is about encouraging Indian industrialists, and is not about going back or the subject of license quota, a reference to protectionist and control economy India practiced before the 1991 reforms.“Our ethos will be progressive, not regressive,” he said.He noted that the coronavirus testing in India has reached 1.6 lakh per day from 10,000 earlier, and the country is manufacturing over 4.5 lakh personal protective equipment (PPE) kits daily as well.The BJP president cited the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, annulment of Article 370, strengthening of anti-terror laws and those against crimes against children and bank mergers among the government’s key successes.He said Union Home Minister Amit Shah played a key role in many of these decisions.Nadda said the Congress worked for long to delay a decision on the Ayodhya case and added that a grand Ram temple would now be built following a Supreme Court verdict.Modi since taking over as prime minister in 2014 changed the “political culture” of governance and infused it with momentum, he said.The coronavirus situation will have an impact on political campaigns during elections, he said, adding that his party has been using technological tools to organise its activities.The first major election in the coming months is the Bihar Assembly polls, slated for October-November.He announced that the party will hold over 2,000 digital rallies across the country to mark the first anniversary of ‘Modi govt 2.0’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-has-limited-understanding-about-covid-19-bjp-chief-jp-nadda/story-X7RvZYari08q0sALhOuGYN.html
30-05-2020||India||Unelected people think they can impose will on govt through courts: Harish Salve||Noted jurist Harish Salve Friday said a lot of people who are not elected representatives feel that they can impose their will on the government through the courts.He made the observation while asserting that one can criticise a judgment and even a judge, but attributing motives to them is wrong.The senior advocate also said violation of privacy is a serious issue and that private data is a valuable property but Indians are not serious about it. Salve, while speaking during a webinar on the issue of ‘Insulting the Judiciary from Social Media Diatribes’, said, “To say judgement is to favour a political party or judge has acted in favour of political party is wrong. Supreme Court is not a dartboard. You can criticise a judgment saying the judge has taken a conservative line.” Salve said some people have got used to pushing the Supreme Court for relief.“When they do not get relief from Supreme Court, they say judges are not doing this because of this reason... Some people are pushing the boundaries by saying Supreme Court deserves ‘F’ grade for its handling of migrants. I have been reading these articles. They are wrong,” Salve said.“A lot of people who are not elected feel that they can impose their will on the government through courts. One can criticise that court saying that (in migrants’ case) either the court should have intervened or not.. but to say that the court is scared of the government is wrong,” he said.He further added, “If I argue a case and I lose, I should think that I tried my best but I lost. But if I get a feeling that the judge did not not give a judgment in my favour because of ... what newspapers might write, then I am worried,” he said.“’If a judge does not agree with me, he is dishonest’ - This tendency must be curtailed. We owe it to the system. We have let our systems down,” Salve said.The senior advocate also said that one may disagree with the court’s judgment on whether 4G has to be allowed or not (in the context of Jammu and Kashmir), but to say that the Supreme Court has not stood with the people of the region is wrong.Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul showed the way in the Supreme Court in the hearing, Salve said. ”He said, if you have no faith in us, you do what you want,” Salve noted. He further said that comments made by judges should not be reported. “‘Supreme Court slams so and so’ is a headline you hear a lot. We need a code of conduct for Court reporters. Media only should write these regulations,” he said.Regarding the controversy on Justice Muralidhar’s transfer from the Delhi High Court to Punjab & Haryana High Court, Salve said he was not in favour of judges overseeing transfer of other judges.“You want the reasons of transfer of judges in public domain? I don’t think so. I therefore wanted a National Judicial Commission, which is independent of the government and not reporting to the court,” he said.  While talking about privacy, Salve said that the Nira Radia tapes were available with the Tax Department was a serious infraction of rules.“Violation of Privacy is a serious issue. Illegally obtained evidence is allowed in India unlike the US. But the person who has obtained it illegally, should be tried. Indians are not serious about privacy. When push comes to shove, we have not stood up for privacy. We have to do that. My private data is a very valuable property. If you treat that data with less importance, then it should be tried with breach of trust,” he said.  While talking about legal reporting, Salve said “we have a complete travesty” in criminal law reporting.“Your investigating agencies are completely off the hook. It’s trial by media. Angry people need instant justice. The way arrest is being covered, it is made to look like he has been sent to the gallows. We have completely lost the soul of law of bail. Public trial is one thing, but a running debate with five panelists commenting is wrong,” he said.He also said India must have tribunals for private defamations.“I have suggested to the government, you must have tribunals for private defamations. Otherwise these hearings go on and on. In the UK, private defamation cases are completed in six months,” he said.He further said the judiciary has a unique position.  “A lot of frustration of the citizens on poor governance can be addressed by the courts is a perception citizens have. Supreme Court is no lesser than the Parliament or no higher than the Parliament,” he said.Salve said if the country’s GDP has gone down by one per cent today, then the Supreme Court has to take some credit for that.  “By closing down mines and a host of judgments… and these judgments are wrong in law,” he said.“Reading the 2G judgment, Coal Scam, I am unconvinced on the law of what Supreme Court has done,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unelected-people-think-they-can-impose-will-on-govt-through-courts-harish-salve/story-FEmDiNNTGFTMfQuFvz9vCL.html

Skymet Weather CEO Jatin Singh said all conditions such as rainfall, Outwave Longwave Radiation (OLR) value and wind speed have been met to declare the arrival of the southwest monsoon over Kerala.“#JUSTIN Southwest #Monsoon2020 finally arrived on the mainland of India, #Monsoon arrived on Kerala before the actual onset date. All the onset conditions including rainfall, OLR value, wind speed, are met. Finally, the 4-month long festival begins for Indian. #HappyMonsoon (sic),” the private forecaster tweeted. The onset of monsoon over Kerala marks the commencement of four-month rainy season in the country. The country receives 75 per cent of the rainfall from June to September.   Skymet had predicted that monsoon will hit Kerala on May 28 with an error margin of plus or minus 2 days. Whereas, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) had said the monsoon will make an onset over Kerala on June 5, four days after its normal onset date. However, earlier this week, it said a cyclonic circulation in the Bay of Bengal will help in advancement of the monsoon and it could reach Kerala on June 1, its normal onset date.   IMD director general Mrutunjay Mohapatra said conditions are still not right to declare onset of monsoon over Kerala. According to the IMD, there are three major conditions to declare the onset of monsoon. The first is if, after May 10, 60 per cent of the 14 weather stations -- Minicoy, Amini, Thiruvananthapuram, Punalur, Kollam, Allapuzha, Kottayam, Kochi, Thrissur, Kozhikode, Thalassery, Kannur, Kudulu and Mangalore -- report rainfall of 2.5 millimetres or more for two consecutive days, the onset over Kerala will be declared on the second day. The second is the depth of westerlies should be maintained up to 600 hectopascals (hPa) and the third is the Outwave Longwave Radiation should be below 200 watt per square metre (wm-2).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/skymet-announces-arrival-of-monsoon-over-kerala-imd-differs/story-5u4SxkgFLZNnviMV1mjUIL.html

Other than the three who were seriously injured, the rest of the passengers escaped with minor injuries. All the injured were rushed to Balasore district headquarters hospital,” a police official said.This is the 13th road accident in Odisha involving migrant workers returning home since May 1 when lockdown conditions were eased for inter-state travel. So far five persons have been killed in these road mishaps. Though migrants have started arriving by Shramik Special trains, many are still arriving by trucks and buses because they are unable to get seats in the trains.Two migrant workers returning from Surat were the first casualties when they were flung off a bus in Kandhamal on May 2.On May 5, one person was killed and 10 others were injured when a bus carrying 40 Odia migrants crashed on National Highway 16 near Khurda.On May 20, two migrant workers died and over 20 were injured in four separate road accidents in Odisha while on May 14, 12 migrant workers were injured, two of them seriously when the minibus carrying them from Andhra Pradesh crashed into a tree. A bus carrying 47 migrant labourers from Bhubaneswar to Ganjam collided head-on with a truck in Baliguda area Kandhamal leading to injury to the drivers of both the vehicles and a passenger on May 26.The 47 migrants had come from Goa by a Shramik Special train and were being sent to Ganjam.

A large proportion of both those tested and those positive were asymptomatic contacts, according to the study by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) scientists along with other collaborators. Healthcare workers constituted about 5.2 per cent of the total infections, said the study published in the Indian Journal of Medical Research (IJMR). According to the study, of the 28.1 per cent asymptomatic patients, 25.3 per cent were direct and high-risk contacts of the cases, while 2.8 per cent were healthcare workers in contact with confirmed the case without adequate protection. “However, the proportion of the asymptomatic infected people could be much more than the 28.1 per cent and this is a cause of concern for us,” Manoj Murhekar, director of the ICMR’s National Institute of Epidemiology and one of the authors of the study, said. The findings stated that the proportion of confirmed cases was highest among asymptomatic contacts, two-three-fold higher than among those with severe acute respiratory infection (SARI), those with an international travel history or healthcare workers, Murhekar said. Between January 22 and April 30, a total of 10,21,518 people were tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Testing increased from about 250 individuals per day in the beginning of March to 50,000 by the end of April. Overall, 40,184 (3.9 per cent) tested positive for the novel coronavirus. In this study, an analysis of the laboratory surveillance data was done to describe the testing performance and descriptive epidemiology of COVID-19 cases by time, place and person. The attack rate (per million) by age was highest among those aged 50-69 years (63.3) and was lowest among those under 10 years (6.1). The attack rate was higher among men as 41.6 of them tested positive, while 24.3 of the women contracted the infection. Coronavirus cases were reported from 523 of the 736 (71.1 per cent) districts in the country. States with the highest proportion of districts reporting positive cases included Delhi, Maharashtra, Kerala, Punjab, Haryana, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat. States/UTs with the highest test positivity are Maharashtra (10.6%), Delhi (7.8%), Gujarat (6.3%), Madhya Pradesh (6.1%) and West Bengal (5.8%). Among the 12,810 cases with reported symptoms at the time of specimen collection, cough and fever were the most commonly-reported symptoms, while around one-third of cases reported sore throat and breathlessness. Gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea were reported by less than five per cent of cases, the study stated. With implementation of the ICMR’s laboratory-based surveillance for the coronavirus, testing was available and accessible, and thus contributed to improved case detection throughout the country, the study underlined. The network of COVID-19 testing laboratories and testing capacity continues to expand. “While the cumulative number of cases continues to increase, the growth rate of reported cases has slowed,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/28-of-covid-19-cases-in-india-till-april-30-are-asymptomatic-study/story-BAf00nsJmmHXouoRwTypfJ.html
30-05-2020||India||Maharashtra schools warned of action if they sack teachers or hold salaries||With reports of several schools in Maharashtra removing teachers or not paying them during the Covid-19 crisis doing the rounds, the state education department has now come up with a circular stating that action would be taken against schools which resort to such practices.“It has come to light that some schools run by private managements are not paying their employees including teachers and non teaching staff citing school closure as a reason. This is not acceptable as the government has already made it clear that paying its staff is the school’s responsibility,” the state education department stated. On May 22, HT reported about a school chain in the city asking nearly 150 of its employees to go on leave without pay until further notice. “A lot of schools are now telling teachers that they cannot pay them salaries citing balance payments from parents. Despite majority parents paying, teachers are being made to wait for their salaries,” said a teacher from a suburban school which has paid only 30% of the total salary to its staff.All educational institutions across the country were ordered to close due to the coronavirus outbreak since the nationwide lockdown was clamped first on March 25. Maharashtra government on March 30 directed schools in the state not to demand fees during the lockdown.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19Some schools said that they were finding it tough to manage their expenses. “Big chains still have a lot of funds but budget private schools like ours get their funds only from fees. Most of our parents have said that they cannot pay full fees while some have not even paid a single installment. We cannot pressurise parents and hence our staff is getting only 50% salary,” said the management member of a school in Malad on the condition of anonymity.Also Read: Air educational programmes on TV, radio: Maharashtra minister writes to CentreSchools that do not pay salaries to staff would have to give an explanation for not doing so and the education department can take action against such schools as per the circular.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-schools-warned-of-action-if-they-sack-teachers-or-hold-salaries/story-pGouv0yc7bmTzUmnBflZfI.html

Domestic services resumed in India after a gap of two months due to the coronavirus lockdown. Indian carriers have operated a total of 1,827 flights till Thursday -- 428 on Monday, 445 on Tuesday, 460 on Wednesday and 494 on Thursday. Puri said on Twitter on Saturday: “Day 5. 29th May till 2359 hrs. Departures 513. 39,969 passengers handled. Arrivals 512. 39,972 passengers handled.” A departure is counted as a flight during the day. During the pre-lockdown period, Indian airports handled around 3,000 daily domestic flights, aviation industry sources said. In February, when the lockdown was not imposed, around 4.12 lakh passengers travelled daily through domestic flights in India, according to Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) data. Airports in West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Telangana and Tamil Nadu have been allowed to handle a restricted number of daily flights as these states do not want a huge influx of flyers amid the rising number of COVID-19 cases. While domestic services resumed in Andhra Pradesh on Tuesday, they restarted in West Bengal on Thursday. Though domestic flight operations across the country began on May 25, they could not be restarted in Kolkata and Bagdogra as the West Bengal machinery was involved in relief and restoration work after cyclone Amphan’s devastation. A total of 16 asymptomatic passengers on seven different flights, including 13 who travelled by IndiGo, have tested positive for COVID-19 since the resumption of domestic air services.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/513-domestic-flights-carrying-39-969-passengers-flew-in-india-on-friday-hardeep-puri/story-bhlY9A2vAjFsqe4NmIpneO.html

However, BJP MP from Indore Shankar Lalwani told PTI that after learning about the order, he had approached the district administration and requested them to change it in public interest.“Gamchhas are convenient for most people and can be used as a precautionary measure against contracting the infection. Many are already using it to protect themselves from the sun,” he said.Several people took to social media to raise objections about the order, claiming that even Prime Minister Narendra Modi was using “gamchha” to protect himself from COVID-19.Following these objections, the district collector changed the order, lifting the ban on the use of “gamchhas” and handkerchiefs as masks. According to the revised order, people will now be able to use different types of masks, including towels and two-layered handkerchiefs when they step out of their homes. The district collector also stated that a spot fine of Rs 100 will be imposed on people who don’t wear protective gear on their faces. Fines ranging from Rs 1,000 to Rs 10,000 will be collected on the spot from heads of commercial institutions, offices etc, if employee dont wear masks at workplaces, the order stated. According to official information, Indore has so far reported 3,431 COVID-19 cases and 129 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/handkerchiefs-towels-can-be-used-as-masks-in-indore-official/story-fvRdaUhn4tgHFYNCKqkM8I.html

Wangchuk adds that China’s recent moves have been not just at the Indian border but also in the South China Sea, Vietnam, Taiwan and now Hong Kong as well.China, he says, is using these moves as a distraction tool for Chinese people due to failures of the administration amid the closure of factories and exports and loss of jobs.He points out that the war with India in 1962 was also one of the tactics by the Chinese government to shift Chinese citizens’ attention away from its failures.“I think wallet power will work more than bullet power this time. The money people spend buying Chinese goods. Just think, you and I, we buy things from idols to clothes worth Rs 5 lakh crore from China. And, this money is used to buy ammunition to kill our soldiers on the border,” he says in the nearly nine-minute video.If all Indians in India and abroad can start a boycott made in China movement, then others across the world may start doing the same. It would, in turn, hit the Chinese economy and its people may turn against the government.“On one hand, our soldiers are fighting them and on the other hand, we would be buying Chinese goods—from mobiles to computers to toys and clothes—and sending money to the Chinese army. It was about hardware. Our youth uses software and apps like TikTok, and give them business worth crores,” Wangchuk said.“So, it is very important that we give them a reply from the citizens and make it a global movement,” he says.Wangchuk also rooted for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s push for self-reliance under the Atamanirbhar Bharat mission.“As I finish my message, I am going to tell you what I am going to do. I will be getting rid of all the Chinese apps on my phone, which is made in China, within a week as well as the phone. And in one year, I will throw out of my life everything that is made in China,” he says.He says, he doesn’t have any problem with China and the Chinese people but the Chinese government and its attitude. He urged people to hold events for everyone to take an oath to boycott Chinese goods until China changes.Sonam Wangchuk had inspired the character of Phunsukh Wangdu, which was played by Aamir Khan in the Bollywood blockbuster 3 Idiots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wallet-power-not-bullet-power-sonam-wangchuk-appeals-for-action-against-china/story-OAlQ1KjgNzlXbX67mniW8J.html

As opposition, we highlighted the failures of the government,” he said.Venugopal said the government “is totally insensitive” to the plight of migrant labourers and farmers. Surjewala also demanded that a virtual session of Parliament be convened immediately to discuss pressing issues and the due process be set in motion for holding of meetings of various parliamentary committees.Modi and his cabinet had taken oath on this day last year for a second term in office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-war-with-people-congress-on-modi-govt-anniversary/story-zDqj086WAQTwjFdoKcp6mN.html

30-05-2020||India||Bombay High Court asks state to file detailed reply on migrant workers||The Bombay High Court has asked the state to file a detailed report by June 2 over a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed by the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) concerning the state of migrant labourers. The PIL sought relief for migrant workers who are opting to take Shramik special trains or buses to return to their native places amid the Covid-19 lockdown.The division bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice KK Tated has asked the state to elaborate on the procedure that a migrant worker is required to follow to be eligible to leave Maharashtra. The bench has also asked the state to specify the waiting period of the migrant labourers to board a train or bus, the nature of shelter being made available to them and the details of provisions made available for their sustenance.The CITU, which was represented by senior counsel Gayatri Singh along with advocates Kranti LC and Ronita Bhattacharya Bector, informed the court that migrant workers who had applied to leave the state are left in the dark about the status of their applications and are being forced to live in unhygienic shelters without food and other basic essentials till they can board the trains or buses.Also read: Experts warn 2020 could be the hottest year since records began In response, additional solicitor general Anil Singh - on behalf of the central government - informed the bench that the plight of the migrant workers had been taken care of by a detailed order of the Supreme Court passed on May 28 and that the measures are to be implemented by all states and reports to be filed by them.After perusing the apex court order, the Bombay High Court bench noted that the directions were issued to all states for simplifying and expediting registration process for migrant workers and to provide them with a helpdesk at the places where they are stranded.As the SC is to hear the petition on June 5, the bench observed, “At this stage, neither are we empowered nor do we wish to make any order contrary to the spirit of the order of the Supreme Court. However, having regard to the peculiar local conditions, we consider it fit and proper to call upon the State to file a report.”The bench further stated that it had come across photographs in newspapers showing congregation of migrant workers on railway platforms and on the adjoining streets.“Such congregation, if allowed, would run counter to the object, for which the lockdown has been imposed,” said the bench. After asking the state to file a detailed report, the bench posted the matter for hearing on June 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bombay-high-court-asks-state-to-file-detailed-reply-on-migrant-workers/story-DyaUBXizFjzqfWwt0nj4SL.html

JD(U) MLA Amar Nath Pandey alias Pappu Pandey has been named in an FIR along with others. Pandey’s elder brother and his son were arrested while the MLA is absconding.On Saturday, Tejashwi Yadav repeated his allegation that Nitish Kumar was “shielding” the JD(U) MLA, named in the triple murder case.“Respected Nitish Ji, If you think you can intimidate us by filing false cases against me & my party leaders then you are living in illusion. We wouldn’t rest untill your favourite criminal MLA is arrested & justice is done. As a LoP, I won’t let Bihar become a lawless state. Thx (sic),” he tweeted.Tejashwi Yadav, who had given a call to party workers and MLAs for a procession to Gopalganj to protest the killings, Tej Pratap, Rabri Devi, Jagadanand Singh and a number of MLAs were prevented by the police and officials who had cordoned off the area, leading to a face-off.DSP (secretariat) Rajesh Kumar Prabhakar had met Tejashwi earlier in the day and handed him a letter saying their procession could not be allowed in view of the Covid-19 lockdown.The stalemate, which lasted hours, ended after Tejashwi said he wished to meet the Bihar assembly Speaker, which was allowed by the district administration.“Our job is to expose the government for its failures on multiple fronts, especially in the wake of lockdown due to Covid-19 pandemic, and we have succeeded in it. We have demanded that special session of the Assembly be called at the earliest to discuss burning issues to further expose the government,” Yadav told his supporters and legislators after coming out of the meeting.Tejashwi said though there was no restriction on movement within the city with proper safeguards during the lockdown, he was stopped even from going to the Vidhan Sabha. “I knew it they would create hurdles, but they have only exposed themselves. Without chief minister Nitish Kumar’s consent, no permission can be granted here,” he said.RJD leader JP Yadav’s mother, father and brother were shot dead in Gopalganj district on Sunday last week.Tejashwi had set an ultimatum till Thursday for JD(U) leader Amar Nath Pandey’s arrest and said he would visit Gopalganj and take out a march if Pandey was not held.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tejashwi-yadav-booked-for-flouting-lockdown-norms-says-not-afraid-of-false-cases/story-h6UKlclFXHjgBcV1dbjXDJ.html

I could not stop clicking and sharing it with everyone, even those I had not been in touch with for ages,” he says. The lockdown has helped us find joy in little, everyday things. Nothing in life should be taken for granted, not even a celestial looking papaya!Kamal says, “With the imposition of the lockdown, nature has been giving us such wonderful delights. When the local fruit seller got me a star-shaped papaya, I immediately shared the picture with many of my friends and relatives. All of them echoed the same sentiment about how nature is giving us hope and subtle hints to fight against Covid -19 with patience and courage. This shape of papaya is very rare and I have never come across such a shape.”With a stable internet connection and camera, connecting with friends online is perhaps easier now than ever. At some point during the lockdown, we all have realised that it’s not as weird to send a picture to someone you haven’t spoken to in years. He says, “This virus has brought long lost friends and acquaintances back to me. I’ve reconnected with people I have not heard from in years. I WhatsApped the picture of papaya to so many of my long lost friends.”Humans have a tendency to adopt a fatalistic mindset that acknowledges human mortality and impermanence, specially during pandemics. Kamal says, “The pandemic has scared all of us, so we’ve broken down social barriers. If not now, then when? This is the question crossing everyone’s mind. What’s the point in waiting anymore to get in touch, to unburden your worries, to tell secrets? We have just one life, we need to make the most of it.”After the corona carnage ends, the world we emerge from will be different. Though the world has shrunk radically, it has been inhabited virtually, for the moment by dozens of people whom all of us had loved and lost and forgotten about.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-star-shaped-papaya-reconnected-this-ht-reader-with-long-lost-friends/story-t8u8ZxFvMjCJ6fE8LyKxQN.html

I assure you that your government is four steps ahead of coronavirus,” said CM Kejriwal on Saturday.The CM also emphasised that the country cannot be in a permanent lockdown. There is a nationwide lockdown, till May 31, in place to halt the spread of the coronavirus disease. “Delhi is witnessing a surge in Covid-19 cases, we accept it. But there is nothing to worry about, I assure you that we are fully prepared. We cannot be in a permanent lockdown,” said Kejriwal.In Delhi, coronavirus cases rose to 17,386 today, and there have been 398 deaths. Nationally, Maharashtra accounts for the highest number of coronavirus cases, followed by Tamil Nadu, Delhi and Gujarat. Out of the total patients in Delhi, the CM informed, only 2100 are in hospitals, the rest are undergoing treatment at their homes. The CM said 6,500 beds are ready and another 9,500 beds will be ready by next week.“Most of the people are recovering, and they are recovering at home. There is no need to panic,” said Kejriwal. On Thursday, Delhi had crossed the key threshold of 1,000 cases on a single day for the first time, reporting 1,024 positive infections.For the first time, the government notified five hotels to be fully used as “extended Covid hospitals” for patients with moderate symptoms. The hotels include JW Marriot, Le Meridien and IBIS. Two of the 10 hotels — Hotel Sheraton in Saket and Hotel Surya in New Friends Colony — will also serve as extended Covid hospital.In a digital press conference on Friday, Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said the government was “fully geared up” to handle more than 1,000 cases a day. To ensure asymptomatic Covid patients do not panic and choose home quarantine instead of insisting on being admitted, the Delhi government on Friday evening also aired a video on news channels, informing people about the dos and don’ts of home quarantine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-govt-four-steps-ahead-of-coronavirus-says-cm-kejriwal/story-mQ515ZXrNRmeJvhxTTdWjM.html

30-05-2020||India||Migrant children at risk of dropping out of school after moving back to hometowns: Experts||Sunita Majhi (name changed) wants to become a doctor. Her father Shyam Majhi believed in his daughter’s dream and to fulfil that he sold most of his property to move to Visakhapatnam so that Sunita could study in a good school.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage But after losing almost everything in the lockdown, Shyam has returned to his village in Odisha’s Kalahandi district and has no plans to send 10-year-old Sunita to school at least for the next one year. “The nearest school is 25 kilometre away. I don’t have the means or the money to bear the cost of her education yet,” Shyam, who worked as a driver in Visakhapatnam, told PTI over phone. Child rights NGOs have expressed concern over migrant children dropping out due to closure of schools. Priti Mahara, Director – Policy, Research and Advocacy, Child Rights and You (CRY) said, “Since the first official national lockdown was announced, schools have been closed across the country. As migrant families return to their villages, struggling for their survival, it is very likely that their children’s access to education will suffer unless special efforts are made.” “The recent traumatic experiences may affect their learning outcome and eventually affect their retention in school. School administration will need to provide special attention and counselling services to these children,” she said. Kamal Gaur, Deputy Director - Education at Save the Children, said Covid-19 has not just been a health emergency but also an education disaster. “Studies suggest that on an average 20 per cent children dropout post emergencies, and the last 90 days lockdown has resulted in complete loss of education for these children who are moving with their migrant families,” she said. Working as a daily wage labourer at multiple construction sites of Greater Noida, Zorawar Singh (name changed) ensured that his two sons went to a respectable private school in Noida. Singh moved back to his village in Rajasthan last week after spending nearly 12 years in Delhi when all his savings were exhausted. “I wanted my sons to become bada sahib and not end up like me. I tried my best,” Singh said. Singh now says he wants his sons to join the workforce and support the family. “My sons are good in studies. One of them wants to become a teacher, while another aspires to become an IAS officer but right now the financial situation is such that I need more hands that could earn,” Singh, whose sons are 15 and 14 years old, said. For Raju Minz, the decision to move back to his village Dumka in Jharkhand from Delhi has been one of the toughest decisions of his life because of the education of his four daughters. “I waited for two months thinking the situation would improve but it didn’t. It just worsened.  My wife and I did all odd jobs just to ensure that my daughters could continue their studies here. But now, all our savings have been exhausted and we will return,” Minz said. “And now my daughters would need to study at home at least for this year, there is no scope in the current situation to send them back to school,” Minz whose daughters are 8, 10, 12, 13 years old said. Priti Mahara suggested that the government schools should collect data of all migrant children from local administration and initiate an enrollment drive after lockdown. “In the current scenario, even those who are receiving any kind of formal or non-formal education will face a lag. While the government has initiated several measures to enable continuity of education during lockdown through online means as well as initiatives using radio, community radio and television, special efforts would have to be made to ensure these children get access to these mediums of communication,” she said. They must also get access to special training or bridge courses to recover the loss in education and get enrolled into grades appropriate to their age into the mainstream education system once the lockdown is lifted up, she said. She further recommended that the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act 2009 must be strictly implemented, which mandates local authorities to ensure admission of children of migrant families. “Equally important is to start early childhood education and enroll children below 6 years in Anganwadi centers,” she said. Gaur said education facilities are anyway hindered by pre-existing inequalities, lack of learning opportunities, homelessness, unemployed parents and sibling care when parents are exploring work opportunities.  “Moreover, current government programmes are Information and Communication Technology (ICT) based and children on the move cannot access it. While institutions are in place, the pandemic has disrupted access to education facilities and unsettled the system of education,” she added. The coronavirus-triggered lockdown has had a devastating impact on the economy as well as on the livelihoods of lakhs of migrant workers. The plight of migrant workers, walking hundreds, sometimes thousands of kilometres, cycling or clambering onto buses and trains, to go from urban centres to their villages has been the focus of concern for almost two months. The Centre has said around four crore migrant labourers are engaged in various jobs across the country. And so far, 75 lakh of them have returned home in trains and buses since the nationwide lockdown was imposed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/migrant-children-at-risk-of-dropping-out-of-school-after-moving-back-to-hometowns-experts/story-nzx5STywMTqPEwfHDjjhUJ.html

Vinayak decided to take a joy ride in his rickshaw, just to be able to help the man without embarrassing him. The incident led to an unlikely camaraderie between the two. “When I signalled him to stop, a smile lit up his face. A 10-minute joyride compensated by Rs 50 made his day,” shares Vinayak.A large number of rickshaw pullers, house-helps, daily wage labourers and other informal workers were left in the lurch, as the government imposed the lockdown in the wake of the coronavirus scare.Harry S. Truman, the 33rd president of the United States, had once said, “The place of labour is side by side with the businessman and the farmer - and not one degree lower.” But it’s tragic that these labourers and daily wage workers have been living on the margins in big cities, earning a little more than what they could have earned in their home towns, somehow surviving in dilapidated conditions. Most of them have insecure jobs in the informal sector and are never accorded any dignity for their work. Vinayak says, “All of us have been feeling the pressure of the lockdown and these daily wagers have been hit the hardest. I have seen Baldev Kumar many times as he waits with his rickshaw in our vicinity. He has catered to so many people at so many points. Some of us choose to ignore the plight of these workers because we feel that we cannot do much to make an impact in their lives. At a personal level, the least that we can do as individuals is to consciously acknowledge the dignity of labour. We must break down the social hierarchies that we have internalised and recognise the importance of all work.”Vinayak shares that Kumar shared our story published on May 21 with his friends and other rickshaw pullers. “He was on cloud nine with when he saw his picture in the newspaper. The article led vegetable vendors in my locality asking for their stories to be published too, so that even their good work reaches to a larger audience!.”A little appreciation post by Anil and HT made Kumar so happy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/doing-good-quietly-ht-reader-anil-vinayak-took-a-joy-ride-in-a-rickshaw-just-to-help-the-rickshaw-puller/story-BGwLYh8FsxM87LFBqMF0TO.html

Gawani, who was deployed to South Sudan last year, is currently posted in New Delhi. The UN gave out the award for the first time to a woman peacekeeper in 2016 for “integrating a gender perspective into peacekeeping activities.”The Indian woman officer received the award along with Brazilian navy officer Commander Carla Monteiro de Castro Araujo.“I’m proud to share that Commander Carla Monteiro de Castro Araujo of Brazil and Major Suman Gawani of India have been awarded the Military Gender Advocate Award. Their @UNPeacekeeping contributions highlight how women peacekeepers are vital to peace and security everywhere,” the UN Secretary-General tweeted.India is one of the largest contributors of personnel to the UN’s peacekeeping operations and women have served in foreign missions in different capacities.South Sudan, the world’s newest country carved out of Sudan in July 2011, represents the second-largest deployment of the Indian Army on foreign soil with more than 2,300 Indian soldiers deployed there. Major Gawani was a military observer at the mission from November 2018 to December 2019.“Gender becomes relevant especially in the places driven by conflict. Women and children being more vulnerable are the worst hit in such situations. UNMISS is making all efforts to deploy more and more female peacekeepers in front roles such as military observers and contingent so that so they can reach deeper into the community and bring some sense of security for the survivors of conflict,” Major Gawani said in a video message released by the army.“While at the mission, she was the principal focal point of contact for gender issues for military observers in the mission. The officer encouraged participation in joint military patrols to maintain gender balance, irrespective of the hardships under extreme field conditions. She visited various mission team sites across South Sudan to integrate gender perspective into the planning and military activity in the mission,” the army said in a statement.“General MM Naravane #COAS congratulates Major Suman Gawani for receiving prestigious United Nations Military Gender Advocate of the Year Award (2019).

Union Home Minister Amit Shah said the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in its six years of tenure had corrected many “historic wrongs” and laid the foundation of a self-reliant India, which is on the road to development. “I heartily congratulate the country’s popular Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the successful one year of Modi 2.0. It has been full of historic achievements,” Shah tweeted. Nadda said Modi had given a new direction to the country’s democracy with his far-sighted policies, dedication and the spirit of team India, and people’s welfare and the country’s interest were reflected in every decision of the government. “I congratulate Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other members of the government on the completion of the successful one year of its second term,” the BJP president said. “This year of the Modi government is full of many achievements.” “This first year of the Modi government’s second term will be known for its tough and big decisions and converting challenges into opportunities,” he said. “Modi implemented decisions which were awaited for decades. These decisions have changed the country’s face.” BJP general secretary (organisation) B L Santhosh described the government as “decisive, caring and visionary”. India marches on converting challenges into opportunities under a dynamic leader, a responsive government and a vibrant society, he said. Modi and his cabinet had taken oath on this day last year.

30-05-2020||India||Indore engages more than 5,000 personnel in identifying Covid-19 patients||Authorities in Madhya Pradesh’s Indore announced on Friday they have engaged about 2,000 additional personnel in identifying patients of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in the city, which is one of the major hotspots in the country.Indore is one of 13 worst-affected cities, which account for 72% of the 165,000 cases across the country till Thursday. The other cities include Mumbai, Chennai, Delhi, Ahmedabad, Thane, Pune, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Jaipur, Jodhpur, Chengalpattu and Thiruvallur.“We are carrying survey, sampling and tracing work more aggressively now while engaging more than 2,000 personnel from health and other departments in this work for quite some time. Thus, we have more than 5,000 personnel now engaged in this task,” Dr Pravin Jadia, chief medical and health officer, said.Dr Jadia said there was no change in the strategy of the department in identifying and treating Covid-19 patients but the number of personnel involved in the survey, sampling and contact tracing was increased considerably.“We have 2,000 teams just for survey only. We have the situation under control as most of the patients identified are those who were identified during the survey and screening and were already quarantined. Also, about 50% of the patients have already recovered and been discharged from hospitals,” he added.Union cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba interacted with chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and other officials on Thursday to assess the situation and how to control it, government officials said.Indore registered 3,260 Covid-19 cases till Thursday evening that accounts for 43% of the infections in Madhya Pradesh that stood at 7,453 as on Thursday evening, according to the state government’s health department’s bulletin. Indore has witnessed the death of 122 patients that accounts for 38% of all the fatalities reported from the state that stood at 321 till Thursday evening.In the past 10 days, the city has reported about 700 cases or 70 cases daily or about three patients every hour on an average despite the oft-repeated claims of the state government and the district administration that the situation in the commercial capital of the state is under control.As the state government and Indore administration are battling with the respiratory disease in Indore, Ujjain, Dhar, Burhanpur, Khargone, Khandwa, Neemuch, Dewas, Mandsaur and Neemuch in Malwa-Nimad region, Sagar in Bundelkhand region, Gwalior and Morena in Gwalior-Chambal region and Raisen in the central region are emerging as Covid-19 hotspots. Bhopal in the central region continues to remain a hotspot with 1,373 cases and 51 deaths.In Sagar, the divisional headquarters in Bundelkhand, 24 new cases were identified in the past 24 hours to take the tally of patients to 165 out of whom 7 have died so far.“We have been requesting the state government right from day one to enhance the number of sampling and tests, upgrade the public health system to have a lab for testing in every district, make a better quarantine plan, chalk out a separate plan for every district and containment zone and let the doctors and experts decide how to contain the disease and treat the patients. But unfortunately, the government’s entire plan and approach is bureaucrats centric,” public health expert Amulya Nidhi said.Mohd Suleman, the additional chief secretary of the health department, could not be reached for his comments.“We need to understand that the state government is doing its best in controlling the situation and chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has gone on record saying that more and more patients are recovering in the state that suggests an improvement in the scenario,” state BJP leader Dr Hitesh Bajpai said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indore-engages-more-than-5-000-personnel-in-identifying-covid-19-patients/story-iUoTPwW1z3Yefx0t89d6PM.html

30-05-2020||India||From Article 370 to CAA to Covid-19: What PM Modi said in letter to citizens||Prime Minister Narendra Modi has written a letter to the nation listing his government’s achievements during his second term and said the decisions taken in the last one year were aimed at fulfilling the dream of making India a global leader.PM Modi also put forward his economic vision for the country and the challenges ahead. Here are the top quotes from his letter: * Back in 2014, the people of the country voted for a substantive transformation. In the last five years, the nation saw how the administrative apparatus broke itself free of the status quo and from the swamp of corruption as well as misgovernance. True to the spirit of ‘Antyodaya’ the lives of millions have been transformed.* From 2014 to 2019, India’s stature rose significantly. The dignity of the poor was enhanced. The nation achieved financial inclusion, free gas and electricity connections, total sanitation coverage, and made progress towards ensuring ‘Housing For All.’ India demonstrated its mettle through the surgical strike and airstrike. At the same time, decades-old demands such as OROP, One Nation One Tax- GST, better MSP for farmers were fulfilled.* The decision on Article 370 furthered the spirit of national unity and integration. The Ram Mandir judgment, delivered unanimously by the Honourable Supreme Court of India, brought an amicable end to a debate persisting for centuries. The barbaric practise of triple talaq has been confined to the dustbin of history. Amendment to the Citizenship Act was an expression of India’s compassion and spirit of inclusiveness.A look at significant moments of Modi 2.0* Many feared that India will become a problem for the world when the coronavirus hits India. But today, through sheer confidence and resilience, you have transformed the way the world looks at us. You have proven that the collective strength and potential of Indians are unparalleled compared even to the powerful and prosperous countries of the world. * In a crisis of this magnitude, it can certainly not be claimed that no one suffered any inconvenience or discomfort. Our labourers, migrant workers, artisans ad craftsmen in small scale industries, hawkers and such fellow countrymen have undergone tremendous suffering. We are working in a united and determined way to alleviate their troubles.* In the last few days, a super cyclone has wreaked havoc in parts of West Bengal and Odisha. Here too, the resilience of the people of these states is noteworthy. Their courage inspires the people of India.* In the economic domain, through their strength, 130 crore Indians cannot only surprise the world but also inspire it. It is the need of the hour that we must become self-reliant. We have to move forward based on our own abilities, in our own way, and there is only one way to do it – Atmanirbhar Bharat or Self-reliant India.* The fragrance of Indian soil along with the sweat, hard work and talent of our workers will create products that will reduce India’s dependence on imports and will move towards self-reliance.* It is the strength of your blessings that has made the nation take historic decisions and progress rapidly in the last one year. However, I am also aware that there is a lot that needs to be done. There are many challenges and problems that our country faces. I am working day and night. There could be deficiencies in me but there is nothing that our country lacks. So, I believe in you, your strength and your abilities even more than I believe in myself.* The source of strength for my resolve is you, your support, blessings and affection. Due to the global pandemic, this is certainly a time of crisis but for us Indians, this is also a time for a firm resolve.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/from-article-370-to-caa-to-covid-19-pandemic-key-points-in-pm-modi-s-letter/story-yoa5VtFXGW8zY8OoTX15HN.html

30-05-2020||India||Goa lokayukta accuses govt of paying lip-service to eradication of corruption||The Goa lokayukta has in a stinging letter to the governor questioned the very need for its existence as an institution if its recommendations are regularly rejected by the government “given the usual attitude of protecting the privileged and the powerful.” Lokayukta Justice PK Misra wrote the letter to Governor Satyapal Malik after the state government rejected his recommendations to prosecute former chief minister Laxmikant Parsekar and two other senior officials for having hurriedly cleared Goa’s mining renewals, including 31 in a single day. “The posterity may rightly question as to why [the] public exchequer should be depleted by having Institutions like the Lokayukta or Human Rights Commission if their reports are to be routinely rejected without bestowing the attention their reports deserve,” Misra said in his letter. The Goa government had in an earlier communication to the lokayukta declined to prosecute Parsekar and the two officers indicted for having allegedly renewed 88 mining leases “with malafide intention”.The lease renewals were struck down by the Supreme Court and petitioner Goa Foundation had filed a complaint with the lokayukta alleging corruption in the lease renewals. The Goa lokayukta conducted an inquiry and ruled that the complaint had been substantiated and recommended that Parsekar and Prasanna Acharya, the then director of mines, and mines secretary PK Sain be asked to demit office while also directing that an FIR be registered against them.“The hasty renewal of 31 mining leases on January 12th 2015, where the file suddenly surfaced before the (Mines) Director, without the files having been placed before him by any preceding note, and recommendations were made without waiting for a mandatory report from [the] IBM (Indian Bureau of Mines) and without waiting for report relating to [the] violation of rule 37 was definitely an abuse of position by the Director,” Misra wrote in the letter. “The other two actors in this sordid drama clearly connived with the Director and cleared all such 31 files in a single day, the day on which the ordinance was issued. If the above acts were not ‘abuse of position’ then God only knows the meaning of such expression and God alone can save the State,” he said.“No amount of legalese can mask the stark reality that the leaseholders received a windfall on account of abuse of position by respondents 1 to 3 by directing renewal of 31 leases on a single day, the day the ordinance came into force,” the letter reads. In January this year, the lokayukta in his verdict on a complaint filed by the Goa Foundation found that the officials “have abused their official position thereby causing loss to the entire State of Goa and benefitting only a few mining leaseholders.”The Goa Foundation had alleged that the act of the state government to renew the leases was an act of corruption.The Goa government renewed 56 mining leases between January 5, 2015, and January 12, 2015, and 31 of which were renewed in a single day—January 12, 2015, the day the Mines and Minerals Development Ordinance, 2015, came into effect. The ordinance made it mandatory that leases will have to be granted through a process of auction, and the lokayukta observed the hurry was obviously to avoid the process of an auction.“If a single, even remote explanation by any of the three respondents as to why and how 31 files which were gathering Covid virus were suddenly resurrected on 12th January 2015, notes were prepared without any relation to any of the previous notes in the concerned files, and approved without bothering to examine the question of compliance and if there were other violations and if stamp duty had been paid, were finalized on the very same day can be pointed out, this institution shall in exercise of its power to review recall the entire report suo motu and instead recommend for conferring appropriate honour on the three respondents preferably on the upcoming Independence Day for the remarkable efficiency shown by the three respondents on 12.1.2015,” the Lokayukta said.Parsekar denied wrongdoing and claimed he acted on the basis of a resolution of the state cabinet and that he should not be singled out for prosecution since it was the collective responsibility of the cabinet.Acharya has said he will explore legal options.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-lokayukta-accuses-govt-of-paying-lip-service-to-eradication-of-corruption/story-LDsn6X5nWmuZL7DypEtfOJ.html

One fatality each was registered in South 24 Parganas, North 24 Parganas and Nadia districts, the bulletin said.West Bengal has a total of 4,813 confirmed Covid-19 cases so far, of which 2,736 are active.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee blamed the rise in the number of cases on the influx of migrant labourers from Covid-19 hotspot states such as Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Delhi and Madhya Pradesh. Meanwhile, four persons at the Nil Ratan Sircar Medical College and Hospital -- two in the gynaecology ward and two in the medicine ward -- tested positive for the virus, sources said.Around 10 personnel from the Kolkata Police combat force also tested positive for the infection, they added.Since Thursday afternoon, 9,282 samples were tested in the state, and the total rose to 1,85,051, the bulletin said.Kolkata accounted for the maximum number of fresh cases at 71, followed by 54 from North 24 Parganas district.

Railways are sending migrants in jam-packed compartments. In one seat, three-four persons are travelling. The railways in the name of Shramik Special trains are running ‘corona express’,” the fiesty TMC boss said. Meanwhile, over a hundred people were discharged from a hospital in West Bengal’s Howrah district on Friday after they recovered from Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-records-over-300-covid-19-fatalities-total-cases-touch-4-813/story-aGz7lBFqY0U25CkdoCjOKL.html
30-05-2020||India||Hizbul Mujahideen terrorist owned explosive-laden car: Cops||A Hizbul Mujahideen militant active in south Kashmir is the owner of the explosive-laden vehicle that security forces intercepted on Thursday, foiling a planned car bombing similar to the 2019 Pulwama attack, J&K police said on Friday.The vehicle, a white Santro, was laden with at least 40 kilograms of explosives and found in a village near Rajpora in Pulwama district, where a suicide car bombing on February 14, 2019, left 40 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) troopers dead. The car was not registered in the Kashmir valley, but in the Jammu division of the J&K Union territory, the police said.A police officer privy to the investigations said the Hizbul militant, who is active in south Kashmir over the last two years and is the owner of the car, is at large, but efforts are on to catch him. The car belongs to Hidayatullah Malik of Sharat Pora village in Shopian district; Malik has been an active militant of the Hizbul since July 2019, said the officer, who requested anonymity.Vijay Kumar, the inspector general of police, (IGP), Kashmir zone, said that security forces received both intelligence inputs last week that the Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), which had claimed responsibility for the 2019 Pulwama attack, and the Hizbul Mujahideen were planning a major suicide attack using a car bomb.“On Wednesday, [J&K] police, Army and the CRPF established multiple barricades after the leads about the attack emerged. In the evening, a naka party directed a car to stop, but it sped away. At another naka, warning shots were fired on the vehicle. The car’s driver fled towards a forest under the darkness of the night,’’ Kumar had said.The police are seeking expert opinion on the nature of the explosives, which were destroyed through a controlled explosion.The Pulwama car bombing led to the Indian Air Force bombing a JeM terror camp in Pakistan’s Balakot and brought India and Pakistan to the brink of war.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hizbul-mujahideen-terrorist-owned-explosive-laden-car-cops/story-r7S2pz0z0zpzIecR0AKzuM.html
30-05-2020||India||Significant moments of Modi 2.0||Ideological MilestonesThe 2019 mandate was interpreted by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) as an endorsement of its long-held ideological beliefs. It also had the political confidence and legislative might to push through changes that it had long sought.The BJP-led government began by leading the passage of what came to be commonly referred to as the Triple Talaq Bill — criminalising instant triple talaq. This, the government claimed, was a step towards gender justice. Critics, however, saw it as a step meant to alienate minorities and potentially victimise Muslim men.On August 5, the government, in a surprise move, pushed through legislative changes on Jammu and Kashmir (J&K). This effectively nullified Article 370, removing the special status the state had enjoyed so far. It also reorganised the state, carving it into two distinct units of J&K and Ladakh. These units were also deemed to be union territories. The government claimed these measures would lead to the greater integration of the region with the rest of India, help citizens in the region enjoy the same rights as citizens elsewhere, and defeat separatism and terrorism. Critics, however, pointed to the fact that the move was not accompanied by consultations with the leaders and people of J&K; it was implemented with draconian measures including large-scale detentions; and could potentially lead to more alienation.The government then pushed through the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill in Parliament. This was aimed at fast-tracking the grant of Indian citizenship to persecuted minorities — Hindus, Christians, Parsis, Jains, Sikhs and Jews — from Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Pakistan. The government argued this was a humanitarian gesture. Opposition parties claimed that the absence of Muslims from the list of communities eligible for citizenship was discriminatory and unconstitutional. They also linked this with a possible National Register of Citizens (NRC) as a step meant to disenfranchise Muslims; the government clarified that NRC was not on the agenda and the move had nothing to do with Indian Muslims.There was one other significant milestone — which aligned with the BJP’s long-held agenda but where the government did not have a role. The Supreme Court, in a landmark verdict in the Ram Janmabhoomi case, while holding the destruction of the Babri Masjid in 1992 as illegal, awarded the disputed land in Ayodhya to the Hindu parties. This has enabled the construction of the Ram Temple at the disputed site.Political landscapeEven as the year was marked by ideological triumphs for the BJP, its record on the electoral front was mixed, with more setbacks than successes.In the first set of state elections after the Lok Sabha polls, Maharashtra threw up a hung assembly — BJP was the single largest party, and along with Shiv Sena, it had a majority. But the Sena demanded rotational chief ministership. When the BJP refused to relent, Sena aligned with the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP). The BJP sought to wean away NCP leader Ajit Pawar, but the ploy failed. Uddhav Thackeray (below) took over as CM and BJP lost one of India’s most important states.In Haryana, the BJP retained power — but it lost its majority, and had to ally with Dushyant Chautala. In Jharkhand, in a subsequent election, the BJP lost power to the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha-Congress combine. And in Delhi, earlier this year, despite a high-voltage campaign, in which several BJP leaders were accused of hate speech, the Aam Aadmi Party won a resounding mandate for the second time in a row, bringing Arvind Kejriwal back to power.All of this established a new trend in Indian politics — of voters carefully distinguishing between national polls and state polls, national leaders and state leaders, and national issues and state issues. Anecdotes from the ground and surveys suggested that PM Modi remained the most popular national leader, but this was not enough to offset local disadvantages the BJP had.The party also confronted another political challenge — in the form of a proliferation of protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and a possible National Register of Citizens. The protests were led largely by Muslims, but also included others opposed to the government. While the BJP’s support base rallied behind the government, the public opposition raised questions about social harmony, and led to international criticism.The economic storyEven as the government scored ideologically and, despite setbacks, continued to remain dominant nationally, the big challenge for it remained the economy.As figures made public on Friday show, growth in 2019-2020 slipped to 4.2% — from 6.1% in the preceding year. For the third year in a row, growth decelerated. An official National Statistical Organisation report, released last year, showed that unemployed had increased in 2017-18 to a 45-year high. According to another report, which was leaked and subsequently not published, real consumption levels dipped between 2011-12 and 2017-18. All of this presented a grim picture. Growth was slowing, unemployment was rising, demand was plummeting. In addition, the balance sheet crisis extended to non-banking financial companies.The government decided to address this situation primarily through supply-side mechanisms. The biggest measure announced was in September last year, when corporate taxes were reduced. The government also unveiled a ₹100 lakh crore infrastructure plan for the next five years. But these measures were not enough to instil confidence and questions about whether the Indian economic story would revive continued to be asked.The coronavirus challengeAnd then the pandemic came home.Modern India has rarely faced a challenge as grave as the coronavirus disease pandemic. As the disease travelled to India and cases increased, PM Modi first announced a one-day people’s curfew and then a three-week national lockdown. The government was given credit for not underplaying the threat and taking decisive action — but it also came in for criticism for not planning the lockdown well.Over the past 70 days, the government has had to confront serious health infrastructure deficits — even as cases have continued to rise. An economy which was already slowing is now staring at an outright recession. Joblessness has grown, demand has dipped further, manufacturing has shrunk, sectors such as aviation and hospitality have borne huge losses, services have been disrupted, supply chains have broken down.Alongside, the government has also had to confront a serious humanitarian crisis, with migrant workers, in millions, returning home to their villages in desperation.PM Modi’s first year was laced with successes and challenges. But the rest of his term, and perhaps, even his legacy, will now he defined by how his government helps India deal with the pandemic — which is set to redefine politics, the economy, and everyday life.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/significant-moments-of-modi-2-0/story-T34LTP0FmEmYRxxSRjQ7WJ.html
30-05-2020||India||Work-from-home policy should also address emotional distress: Govt staff||Managing emotional distress, digital literacy and cyber hygiene are the key concerns flagged by government employees as the Centre drafts a work-from-home policy in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic.These concerns, and how employees can be assured of an objective, performance-oriented assessment of the work they do from home, were articulated at a webinar organised by the department of science and technology, Rajasthan, in association with the Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances (DARPG) on Thursday.The event could be the first in a series of webinars to be held with various states on the work-from-home policy, said an official at DARPG, which is spearheading efforts towards putting the policy in place. “Work from home is here to stay,” DARPG additional secretary V Srinivas said at the webinar. “Offices will not work with 100% capacity in the near future. Cooperative federalism has become pivotal and we need to ensure seamless exchange of information between the Centre and the state governments...”Charru Malhotra, associate professor at the Indian Institute of Public Administration, said ensuring equipment and infrastructure to work from home is efficient will be key. Moreover, not only physical well being, while working from home, emotional distress also has to be taken into account,” Malhotra said. “Some aren’t doing as well as they used to when offices were functional. There are a host of emotional and mental pressures that may affect the capability of people who are not used to working in closed spaces.”Secretary of the department of science and technology, Rajasthan, Mugdha Sinha, agreed that mental health of the employees is an important factor. Dr Ritu Sharma of Delhi University said a “performance-oriented assessment should be standardised and objective”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/work-from-home-policy-should-also-address-emotional-distress-govt-staff/story-z5FX626qR7lcIv8JusNr9N.html
30-05-2020||India||Army seeks to purchase land from J-K’s Baramulla district administration||After the revocation of Jammu and Kashmir special status with the abrogation of Article 370 of the Constitution last August, the Army has set out to buy land for its camps in the Valley. In the first such instance, the Army has approached Baramulla administration, evincing interest in buying 129 kanal (6.5 hectare) of land at Kreeri high ground at Tapperwari in Pattan area of the north Kashmir district, where the troops are already “temporarily stationed”, defence sources said.They said the Quartermaster for Commanding officer of the 19 Infantry Division Ordnance Unit has written to the district administration, requesting it to inform if the administration wishes to sell the land to the Indian army. The Army has sought the district administration reply by May 30, the sources added. It is perhaps for the first time that the Army has directly written to the department concerned for purchasing land in the Valley. Prior to the abrogation of Article 370 on August 5 last year, the defence estates officer would write to Jammu and Kashmir government for getting lease of the land required by the Army.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-seeks-to-purchase-land-from-j-k-s-baramulla-district-administration/story-vnBloOA1k5Fi4mhlSxXdEO.html
30-05-2020||India||‘A year of historic firsts for Indians’: PM Modi in letter to citizens||My fellow Indian,This day last year began a golden chapter in the history of Indian democracy. It was after several decades that the people of the country voted back a full term government with a full majority. Once again, I bow to the 130 crore people of India and the democratic ethos of our nation.During normal times, I would have been in your midst. However, the present circumstances do not permit that. That is why I seek your blessings through this letter.Your affection, goodwill and active cooperation have given new energy, and inspiration. The way you have showcased the collective strength of democracy is a guiding light for the whole world.A look at significant moments of Modi 2.0Back in 2014, the people of the country voted for a substantive transformation. In the last five years, the nation saw how the administrative apparatus broke itself free of status quo and from the swamp of corruption as well as misgovernance. True to the spirit of ‘Antyodaya’ the lives of millions have been transformed.From 2014 to 2019, India’s stature rose significantly. The dignity of the poor was enhanced. The nation achieved financial inclusion, free gas and electricity connections, total sanitation coverage, and made progress towards ensuring ‘Housing For All.’India demonstrated its mettle through the surgical strike and air strike. At the same time, decades old demands such as OROP, One Nation One Tax- GST, better MSP for farmers were fulfilled. In 2019, the people of India voted not merely for continuity but also with a dream— of taking India to new heights. A dream of making India a global leader. The decisions taken in the last one year are directed at fulfilling this dream.Today, 130 crore people feel involved and integrated in the development trajectory of the nation. The light of ‘Jan Shakti’ and ‘Rashtra Shakti’ has ignited the entire nation. Powered by the Mantra of ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas’ India is marching forward in all spheres. My fellow Indian,In the last one year, some of the decisions were widely discussed and remain etched in public discourse.The decision on Article 370 furthered the spirit of national unity and integration. The Ram Mandir judgment, delivered unanimously by the Honourable Supreme Court of India, brought an amicable end to a debate persisting for centuries. The barbaric practice of triple talaq has been confined to the dustbin of history. Amendment to the Citizenship Act was an expression of India’s compassion and spirit of inclusiveness.But there have been many other decisions that have added momentum to the nation’s development trajectory. The creation of the post of the Chief of Defence Staff was a long pending reform that has improved coordination among the armed forces. At the same time, India has stepped up preparations for Mission Gaganyaan.Empowering the poor, farmers, women and youth has remained our priority.PM Kisan Samman Nidhi now includes all farmers. In just one year, more than ₹72,000 crore has been deposited in the accounts of over nine crore fifty lakh farmers.The Jal Jeevan Mission will ensure supply of potable drinking water through piped connections to over 15 crore rural households. A huge campaign of free vaccination is being conducted for better health of our 50 crore livestock. For the first time in our country’s history, farmers, farm labourers, small shopkeepers and workers in the unorganised sector are assured the provision of regular monthly pension of ₹3,000 after the age of 60 years.Besides the facility of availing of bank loans, a separate department has also been created for fishermen. Several other decisions have been taken to strengthen the fisheries sector. This will boost the blue economy. Similarly, it has been decided to constitute a Vyapari Kalyan Board for timely resolution of the problems of the traders. Higher quantum of financial assistance is being provided to more than seven crore women attached to self help groups. Recently the loans without guarantee for self help groups has been doubled to ₹20 lakh from the earlier ₹10 lakh.Keeping in mind the education of tribal children, we have begun the construction of more than 400 new Ekalavya Model Residential Schools. Several people friendly laws have been ushered in during the last year. Our Parliament has broken the decades-old record in terms of productivity. As a result, whether it be the Consumer Protection Act, the amendment to the Chit Fund Law or laws to provide more protection to women, children and Divyang, their passage in Parliament was expedited.As a result of the policies and decisions of the government, the rural-urban gap is shrinking. For the first time, the number of rural Indians using the internet is 10% more than the number of urban Indians. The list of such historic actions and decisions taken in national interest would be too long to detail in this letter. But I must say that every day of this year, my government has worked round the clock with full vigour, taking and implementing these decisions.My fellow Indian, As we were moving ahead at a fast pace in the fulfilment of hopes and aspirations of our countrymen, the coronavirus global pandemic engulfed our country as well.While on one hand are powers with great economic resources and state-of-the-art health care systems, on the other hand is our country besieged with problems amid a vast population and limited resources.Many feared that India will become a problem for the world when the coronavirus hits India. But today, through sheer confidence and resilience, you have transformed the way the world looks at us. You have proven that the collective strength and potential of Indians are unparalleled compared even to the powerful and prosperous countries of the world. Be it clapping and lighting a lamp to honour Corona Warriors by India’s armed forces, Janta Curfew or by faithful adherence to rules during the nationwide lockdown, on every occasion you have shown that Ek Bharat is the guarantee for Shrestha Bharat.In a crisis of this magnitude, it can certainly not be claimed that no one suffered any inconvenience or discomfort. Our labourers, migrant workers, artisans ad craftsmen in small scale industries, hawkers and such fellow countrymen have undergone tremendous suffering. We are working in a united and determined way to alleviate their troubles.However, we have to take care to ensure that inconveniences that we are facing do not turn into disasters. Hence, it is very important for every Indian to follow all rules and guidelines. We have displayed patience so far and we should continue to do so. This is one of the important reasons for India being safer and in a better state than many other countries. This is a long battle but we have started traversing on the path of victory, and victory is our collective resolve.In the last few days, a super cyclone has wreaked havoc in parts of West Bengal and Odisha. Here too, the resilience of the people of these states is noteworthy. Their courage inspires the people of India. Dear friends,In such a time, there is also a widespread debate on how the economies of various countries, including India’s, will recover. However, given the way India has surprised the world with its unity and resolve in the fight against the coronavirus, there is a firm belief that we will also set an example in economic revival. In the economic domain, through their strength, 130 crore Indians cannot only surprise the world but also inspire it.It is the need of the hour that we must become self-reliant. We have to move forward based on our own abilities, in our own way, and there is only one way to do it – Aatmanirbhar Bharat or Self-reliant India.The recent ₹20 lakh crore package given for Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan is a major step in this direction.This initiative will usher in a new era of opportunities for every Indian, be it our farmers, workers, small entrepreneurs or youth associated with start ups.The fragrance of Indian soil along with the sweat, hard work and talent of our workers will create products that will reduce India’s dependence on imports and will move towards self-reliance.Dear friends,In this journey of the last six years, you have continuously showered me with love and blessings. It is the strength of your blessings that has made the nation take historic decisions and progress rapidly in the last one year. However, I am also aware that there is a lot that needs to be done. There are many challenges and problems that our country faces. I am working day and night. There could be deficiencies in me but there is nothing that our country lacks. So, I believe in you, your strength and your abilities even more than I believe in myself.The source of strength for my resolve is you, your support, blessings and affection.Due to the global pandemic, this is certainly a time of crisis but for us Indians this is also a time for a firm resolve.We must always remember that the present and future of 130 crore will never be dictated by an adversity.We will decide our present and our future.We will move ahead on the path of progress and victory will be ours.It is said that:This means, if we have action and duty on one hand, then success is assured on the other hand. With prayers for our country’s success, I bow to you once again. My heartiest wishes to you and your family. Stay healthy, stay safe!!!Stay aware, stay informed!!!Your Pradhan SevakNarendra Modi||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-year-of-historic-firsts-for-indians-pm-modi-in-letter-to-citizens/story-hkVsXYqYDkBks3EkcHR9rJ.html

30-05-2020||India||Covid-19: US pharma giant seeks marketing authorisation from India for remdesivir||US pharma giant Gilead Sciences has applied to India’s drug regulator seeking marketing authorisation for its anti-viral drug remdesivir, which is being touted as a potential treatment for Covid-19.Gilead Sciences, who is the patent holder of the drug, has the complete data about the pre-clinical and clinical studies for remdesivir, sources said.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“The company has applied seeking marketing authorisation for its anti-viral drug remdesivir to India’s Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO). The CDSCO will examine the application with the help of the expert committee. It will take a final decision based on the recommendations of the expert committee,” a source said.  The medicine has been issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat hospitalised coronavirus-infected patients.    Regulatory approval under exceptional pathway was granted by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare on May 7, on the basis of clinical data from the US, sources said.On the basis of approvals granted by USFDA or any other reputed regulator, the Indian regulator can approve the drug by waiving off clinical trials in special circumstances in accordance with the provisions of the New Drug and Clinical Trial Rules 2019, a source in the know of the developments said.This comes in the backdrop of two Indian pharmaceutical companies -- Cipla and Hetero Labs -- applying to the drug regulator seeking permission to manufacture and sell remdesivir in India.  They have also sought a clinical trial waiver for remdesivir so that the medicine can be made available for the patients faster, an official said.Their applications are still under consideration, the official said.Gilead Sciences Inc have entered into non-exclusive licensing agreements with pharma firms including three domestic majors Cipla, Jubilant Life Sciences and Hetero for manufacture and distribution of remdesivir.   The Indian Council of Medical Research had earlier said anti-viral medication remdesivir which was used during Ebola outbreak may inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 replication and research on its efficacy in the treatment of Covid-19 is a part of the WHO’s ‘solidarity trial.’  According to a recently published study in the New England Journal of Medicine, two out of three critically ill coronavirus patients who were on oxygen support showed signs of improvement when they were administered remdesivir.All new drugs have to undergo trials before getting approval for marketing them in India.  But the New Drug and Clinical Trial Rules, 2019, provide for certain clauses, according to which the provision of waiver of local phase-III clinical trials of the drug is approved and marketed in certain countries (as notified from time to time) subject to certain conditions, like national emergency or epidemics, in public interest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-us-pharma-giant-seeks-marketing-authorisation-from-india-for-remdesivir/story-d0UZMiw68SBLV8P18md93M.html

The director-rank official, his wife and children tested positive on Thursday, the officials said, without specifying the number of children. He worked in the first floor of the Parliament House Annexe, where a week ago another senior official with the editorial and translation (E&T) services tested positive.The director had attended office until Thursday before going into quarantine with the other members of his family, the officials cited above said.The first floor of the annexe has several meeting rooms for parliamentary panels. His room had been sanitized and sealed by Thursday evening. The security service of Parliament also decided to take no chances and sanitized the entire floor, elevators, washrooms, corridors, the passage from the VIP Gate and staff gate to his room.According to the officials cited above, while many parliamentary committee meetings take place in the annexe, an upcoming meeting of the standing committee on home affairs is likely to be held in the main Parliament building, which has not reported any Covid-19 case so far.

30-05-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||What proportion of India’s population is infected with Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes the coronavirus disease?What proportion of tests return a positive result in Delhi?Why are so many passengers landing in Coimbatore testing positive?These are important questions — and linked ones.In Delhi, and in Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra, the proportion of tests returning a positive result remains high. In the seven days to May 21, the average daily positivity (as it is called) rate was 9.4% in Delhi. It was 17.9% in Maharashtra, and it was 5.7% in Tamil Nadu.Also read: Centre may announce second stimulus to increase demand amid Lockdown 4.0And in the seven days till Thursday, May 28, the corresponding numbers were 12.2%, 18%, and 6.1% respectively.All three states tested more people on average in the seven days ended May 28 compared to the previous seven-day period. Delhi did 5,370 tests a day as compared to 4,950; Maharashtra, 14,244 against 11,366; and Tamil Nadu 14,189 as against 10,838.These positivity rates would be alarming if not for the fact that they pretty much reflect the trend across most countries, including the US, which has seen the most number of cases and deaths. Positivity rates keep increasing with the number of tests, plateau at a certain level as the tests increase further, and finally start falling as the number of tests increases even more. Given the trend of the disease in other countries, in India, the states of Delhi, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu will likely be the first to see the positivity rates declining — but they aren’t there yet. The two-week trend line for Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu would appear to be flattening, but this needs to happen for a longer period before it can be safely assumed that the positivity rates have peaked.The high positivity rates can also be explained by India’s testing protocol, which still skews the sample towards those likely to be infected; it is difficult to get a test done unless one has severe symptoms, has been exposed to an infected person, or takes a flight to certain states (or certain cities within those states). More on the last anon.Also read: Govt may plan scheme for welfare, jobs of migrantsIs there a relationship between the positivity rate and the proportion of a country’s population that has been exposed to the virus (and which is, as a result, immune)?There should be, but this only applies when a population has been tested widely, not at the current levels of testing in India.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage Now to the issue of passengers landing in Coimbatore — flights started earlier this week — testing positive, as reported by both local officials and airlines. That’s probably because everyone landing in Coimbatore is tested — just like everyone landing in Jammu is. Not all states require arriving domestic air passengers to be tested; nor do all cities within a state. Some make do with screening and quarantining. In the case of the passengers who tested positive in Coimbatore, most are reported to be asymptomatic. The interesting thing about them is, because their Aarogya Setu apps showed them to be “safe”, and because they didn’t have symptoms, they would have never been tested if they had not taken the flight to a city that mandated tests for all arrivals. This is another piece of evidence that points to the number of people infected by the coronavirus in India actually being far higher than the tested numbers. This is actually a good thing because it means the case fatality rate in India, already at 2.8%, much lower than the global average of 6.1%, is actually even lower and because it means we are slowly inching our way up towards achieving herd immunity. To be sure, we are a long way from that, but till a vaccine is discovered, that remains our best bet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-TD2pK2awzRH3OwpIoxTpZO.html
30-05-2020||India||Railway Protection Force reports 80 deaths on Shramik trains||There have been almost 80 deaths on board the Shramik Special trains (for stranded migrant workers) between May 9 and May 27, according to data from the Railway Protection Force reviewed by Hindustan Times.The trains were launched on May 1, and till May 27, 3,840 have been run, transporting around five million migrant workers back home. On Wednesday, there were reports of nine deaths on these trains over the previous few days, but the rail ministry clarified immediately that most of those who died were “chronic disease patients” many of whom were actually in the cities for “medical treatment” and could come back only after these special trains were launched. It was responding to some reports that claimed the passengers died of exhaustion, heat, and hunger. This is the first time, though, that details of more deaths are emerging. An RPF official confirmed the numbers and said that an initial list has been complied, however, a final list will soon be issued after coordinating with the states.A spokesperson for the ministry of railways, upon being specifically asked about the 80 deaths, said the “chairman railway board had responded to the query in the press conference.” At a press conference on Friday, railway board chairman VK Yadav said: “Anyone’s death is a big loss... Indian Railways has a control system were the train is immediately stopped if someone is found ill and they are sent to the nearest hospital base to try and save their lives. Many such passengers were attended to and many deliveries also took place. I can imagine the plight of labourers travelling even in these conditions. In case of deaths, the local zones investigate the reason and without an investigation, there are allegations that they died of hunger when there was no shortage of food. Some deaths occurred and we are compiling the figures... we will issue the figures in a few days.” He did not mention any number. To be sure, the RPF data will need to be vetted and validated by the ministry. According to the data reviewed by HT, the deaths were recorded from May 9 till May 27 across several zones including the East Central Railway zone, North Eastern Railway zone, Norther Railway Zone and North Central Railway zone; and the ages of the dead ranged from 4 to 85. The list also mentions the co-morbidities or accidents that caused the deaths in a few cases. Data between May 1 and May 8 was not available. There have been 18 deaths in the North Eastern Railway zone, 19 in North Central zone and 13 in East Coast Railway zone. Nearly 80% of total Shramik trains are destined for Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, and ply on these zones.The Railway ministry, in response to reports of the nine deaths ,said in a statement on Friday morning: “Indian Railways has been running Shramik special Trains on a daily basis throughout the country to ensure that migrants can travel back to their homes. It has been observed that some people who are availing this service have pre-existing medical conditions which aggravates the risk they face during the Covid-19 pandemic. A few unfortunate cases of deaths related to pre-existing medical conditions while travelling have happened.” “Heat, exhaustion and thirst are among the primary issues faced by the passengers on board these trains. We have seen several of such cases over the past month,” a zonal railway officer said, requesting anonymity, referring to the 80 deaths reported across the country. According to RPF data, there have been 10 deaths in Northern Railway zone. “I am not aware of the total numbers but in all the cases that we know of there were health conditions like one person had heart valve replaced, one had hypertension. But to say that the primary reason of deaths is hunger is not correct,” said Northern Railways’ spokesperson. On Friday, railway minister Piyush Goyal also issued a statement appealing to people suffering from ailments to avoid travel by Shramik Trains.“I appeal to people suffering from serious ailments, pregnant women & those above 65 years and below 10 years of age to travel only when necessary in Shramik Trains. Railway Parivaar is committed to ensuring safety of all passengers,” he said.In several cases reported by the railways the reasons for the deaths are pre-existing illness. In the case of 23-year-old Parbina Khatun, from Katihar District in Bihar the report says, “travelling from Ahmadabad to Madhubani with her sister, died due to her illness. Body was detrained for further action.” She died on May 25. In West Central Zone, on May 16, Javed Ahmed aged 55 years, was found dead aboard a train. The ministry’s report said: ” He fell unconscious between Itarsi-Piparia of Jabalpur division/WCR GRP Jabalpur took custody of the deceased body for further course of action. District administration has been informed and they are checking his family.”On Thursday, in an interim order, the Supreme Court said states where the workers are boarding trains and Indian Railways should provide food and water to the migrants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/railway-protection-force-reports-80-deaths-on-shramik-trains/story-psJl3EenY4B0uUYMRvkChL.html
30-05-2020||India||Amid lockdown, this Kolkata hospital is conducting dialysis at Rs 50 only||At a time when most patients are facing increased medical expenses for hospital treatment due to increased cost of operation in the hospitals and increased transport cost, a small hospital in Kolkata is conducting dialysis for patients with kidney ailments at Rs 50 only.The hospital in central Kolkata, named Kolkata Swasthya Sankalp, has been a low-cost dialysis centre essentially for the poor and used to charge Rs 350 per dialysis. This is nearly one third of the cost of dialysis at government-hospitals.“We had designed the hospital in a low-cost manner. There is no air-conditioning, no lift, no reception and no waiting area for patients’ families. Of the three doctors, only one resident doctor gets a stipend. Others, including myself, offer services for free. So, we managed to keep our usual rate at Rs 350 per dialysis,” Fuad Halim, who runs the hospital said.The five-bedded hospital attached to Halim’s residence on Dr. Md Ishaque Road has nine dialysis machines. During the two months of the lockdown, the hospital also witnessed a change in the background of its patients.According to Halim, only the poor used to visit the hospital before lockdown but since the lockdown even people belonging to the lower middle class have been visiting it. To handle this added pressure a new dialysis machine was installed.“After lockdown, we realized that patients had to cough up more money for transport. So, we decided to subsidise the cost from our corpus. At least 1,571 dialysis were conducted between March 26 and May 28 at Rs 50 per dialysis,” Halim said.Halim is also a member of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and had contested the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. His father, Hasim Abdul Halim, was Bengal’s longest-serving Assembly speaker.According to a patient who did not want to reveal his identity, “I worked as a salesman at a prominent market. Previously, I used to visit a better hospital, which has recently increased its rates saying Covid-19 precautions have increased their medical costs. I could not afford it anymore, especially with no income for two months.”Mirza Hassan, a resident of Park Circus whose uncle underwent dialysis here, said, “This hospital comes as a great hope despite the inconveniences. We were not in a position to take my uncle to any other nursing home because of the increased cost of transport and increased rates at the nursing home.” While the patients undergo dialysis, their family members wait nearby.Each dialysis takes about four hours.Doctors in the city said private nursing homes usually charge between Rs 1,200 and Rs 1,500 per dialysis but increased them to over Rs 2,000 since lockdown.“We had to increase the rate due to the increased costs on account of sanitization, PPE and masks,” said the owner of a private nursing home in south Kolkata who did not want to speak on record.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-lockdown-this-kolkata-hospital-is-conducting-dialysis-at-rs-50-only/story-He1Rom5xeRLKC0s0vWlcCN.html
30-05-2020||India||Karnataka asks travellers from high-risk states to pay Rs 650 for mandatory Covid-19 test||The Karnataka government on Friday issued an order whereby passengers coming in by air or trains from high-risk states will have to pay Rs 650 per person to get themselves mandatorily tested for Covid-19. The government said that it had decided on this move as there was a limitation on the institutional quarantine capacity available in the state.Earlier, all the passengers from high-risk states such as Maharashtra, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan and Delhi were quarantined at hotels and lodges and a Covid-19 test was carried out on either the 5th or 7th day. Till now the passengers were paying only for the institutional quarantine - according to desired hotels and slabs - while the test was free.Health department officials though clarified that while there was no change in quarantine policies with people coming from high-risk states having to undergo one week of institutional quarantine and if their test was asymptomatic then they would be sent for one more week of home quarantine. For this, the state has tied up with private labs so that their capacity could be utilised to the maximum. Samples will be tested by the pooling method - five samples in one pool as per ICMR guidelines.There was no clarity on what would be done in case the incoming person by train or air could not afford the fee of Rs 650 for testing. The order also said that airport authorities and railways will provide necessary space for establishing swab collections kiosks and centres free of cost. Whenever a passenger is detected positive, after the test, the jurisdictional district health and family welfare officer shall be informed for necessary movement of the patient to a hospital, contact tracing and tracking. Outside of Bangalore the deputy commissioners of the remaining 29 districts shall link ICMR approved private labs with passengers and follow similar protocols.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-asks-travellers-from-high-risk-states-to-pay-rs-650-for-mandatory-covid-19-test/story-hvl2b0KoUOgtzOXfe9oSPM.html
30-05-2020||India||Delhi adds another 1,000 Covid-19 cases, toll rises by 82||Delhi reported more than 1,000 cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on Friday for the second consecutive day, prompting the city-state’s government to announce a raft of measures to elevate the state’s preparedness to deal with a potential surge of infections. On Friday, 1,106 new cases of Covid-19 were added to the city’s tally, Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said at a press briefing. According to the official health bulletin, the total number of cases in the city are 17,386. However, with the addition of 1,106 cases to Delhi’s tally of 16,281 from Thursday, Friday’s cases should have stood at 17,387. There was no immediate clarification from the government on the discrepancy. The city’s death toll from the viral disease rose to 398 with the addition of 82 fatalities, although only 13 of the deaths were from the preceding 24-hour period. On Thursday, Delhi crossed the key threshold of 1,000 cases on a single day for the first time; it is the third of three scenarios projected by a five-member panel of doctors advising the Delhi chief minister which had foreseen the daily tally rising progressively from 100 to 500 to 1,000 cases. The sudden spike in the numbers has been attributed to increased testing by officials of Delhi’s health department. According to the Friday health bulletin, 7,649 samples had been tested over the past 24 hours, compared to 7,615 the day before, which is much higher than the average 4,900 samples tested each day over the past week. Delhi now tests 10,075 people per million, as compared to the Indian average of 2,614 a million. “If you see the data, the numbers have gone up because more people have been tested during these two days – these samples were collected both from the community and from those who had come in contact with the positive cases,” said a senior official from Delhi’s health department who requested anonymity.As the daily tally rose past 1,000 for the second day in a row, the Delhi government on Friday ordered the setting up of 1,900 new beds, including paid hospital facilities in hotels. The government for the first time notified five hotels to be fully used as “extended Covid hospitals” on a payment basis for patients with mild symptoms. While 1,000 beds are being readied in these five hotels, another 400 beds were added through a second order on Friday in which two Delhi government hospitals with 200 beds each were converted into dedicated Covid hospitals. In a third order, the government earmarked 500 beds in GTB Hospital for Covid-19 patients.In a digital press conference on Friday, Delhi health minister Satyendra Jain said the government was “fully geared up” to handle more than 1,000 cases a day. “We have more than 5,000 beds for coronavirus treatment in Delhi. Out of this, 1,400 beds are in private hospitals, and 3,700 in government hospitals. The number of patients currently on the ventilator is 28. And we have more than 300 dedicated ventilators available currently in Delhi. Our aim is to double the number of beds in the coming days in comparison to the number of patients right now,” said the minister. Along with the number of cases, the positivity rate, or the percentage of people who test positive among the total number of people tested, also increased. The positivity rate -- the rate at which tests return positive for the infection -- in the city was 14.5% on Friday, higher than 11.2% a week before on May 22.“A high positivity rate indicates that there are more cases in the community being diagnosed. Right now, we are mainly testing symptomatic individuals and it would be ideal to test more to diagnose them early and isolate them,” said Dr Shobha Broor, former head of the department of microbiology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences.The testing capacity of laboratories in the city is limited and government labs that are handling the maximum samples have already reached their limit, warned Dr Broor, who is still in touch with former colleagues and members of the medical fraternity at other hospitals.Delhi also registered a sharp spike in the number of deaths, with 82 deaths being added to the cumulative toll on Friday. The Delhi health minister said 69 of these deaths had occurred over a period of 34 days and had been recorded after verification by the death audit committee. This pushed the case fatality ratio of the viral infection in the city to 2.3%, which is still lower than the national average of 2.8%. On May 11, before the death audit committee started recording backlog deaths, Delhi’s mortality rate was 1%.Confirmed Covid-19 cases crossed 500 on a single day on May 19,two weeks after the first wave of lockdown relaxations were announced by the Delhi government on May 4 . The relaxation included opening of liquor stores and movement of people in personal vehicles, among others. The incubation period, or the time an infected person takes to develop symptoms, is five to six days.“If more people are tested, more people will turn out to be positive. The numbers are likely to go up further now that travel has resumed and markets have opened up. If you look at global data, India is on an increasing trend right now. The only way to contain the infection in pockets is to seal every lane where cases are being reported,” said Dr GC Khilnani, chairman of PSRI Institute of Pulmonary and critical care.With the city reporting over 1,000 cases a day, hospitals have started filling up. The currently designated Covid-19 hospitals are running at about 74% capacity. There are three levels of care for Covid-19 patients in Delhi: Those with mild symptoms can either remain in home isolation or get admitted to the Covid Care Centres, those with moderate symptoms like a slightly elevated respiratory rate are admitted to Covid Health Centres with better monitoring, and those with severe symptoms such as respiratory distress and very low oxygen saturation are admitted to hospitals. There are a total of 9,142 active cases in Delhi, out of which almost 24% are admitted to hospitals, 50% are in home isolation and the remaining in Covid Care centres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-adds-another-1k-cases-toll-rises-by-82/story-LqaDHLk9IlnpjD4tZHsVRJ.html
30-05-2020||India||Twitter censors ‘provocative’ Trump post, President hits back with order||US President Donald Trump’s executive order targeting social media companies may be motivated by personal and not national concerns — in this case, a spat with Twitter — but does reflect a growing concern around the world over the role these companies play in disseminating information and shaping opinions, both akin to the role traditionally played by media firms, even while being legally protected from being sued for content. This is especially ironic because the main source of revenue for such platforms is the same as that for media companies — advertising, which, in their case, is sharply targeted given the extent of information they have about their users. Section 230 of a 1996 US federal law protects these platforms from being treated as “publishers” even while it gives them the powers to moderate or regulate content without any liability.Trump’s ire, as mentioned in the executive order passed on Thursday, is that the “online platforms are engaging in selective censorship that is harming our natural discourse”; “flagging content as inappropriate even though it does not violate any stated terms of service” ; and “deleting content and entire accounts with no warning”. The order targeted Twitter, which it said “selectively decides to place a warning label on certain tweets in a manner that clearly reflects political bias” and which “never seems to have placed such a label on another politician’s tweet”. The reference was to Twitter fact-checking two of Trump’s tweets about mail-in-ballots. But far from backing away, Twitter responded by flagging a post from the US President several hours later for violating its policy on glorifying violence. Trump’s action struck a chord in India where social media platforms have been accused of bias and trying to behave like media companies without any of the accountability that entails. Information technology minister Ravi Shankar Prasad warned that “the right to freedom of opinion must be respected by platform owners otherwise they themselves will be questioned by the people of stifling a contrary view”.“What is happening in America is their concern; I have no comment to offer on that,” said Prasad. “As an IT minister, I can only say that India is a free, democratic country and we appreciate the role of social media in empowering people. However, these social media platform operators must follow certain well defined norms, not promote hatred, terrorism, secessionism and communal violence,” he added in an interview. In the past, these platforms have been accused of bias. “Criticism is welcome but if only one type of criticism is allowed and the counter to it is shelved, then it is not fair. The social media platforms need to acknowledge that free, frank and responsible exchange regardless of political colour or ideology, is of essence in a democratic world and if there are grievances on that score that a platform is favourably disposed towards one and hostile against the other, then it is neither fair nor appreciated,” Prasad explained. When asked if he was dissatisfied with Twitter’s response to his concerns, he said: “In some cases they have been responsive, in others they need to be more proactive.”Internet freedom activist and founder of medianama, Nikhil Pahwa, said that governments, including India, will use what they can to control social media platforms. In a LinkedIn post, he wrote that since India was pushing for traceability of a message and proactive takedown of content, “this might lead to the minister saying his ministry is justified in proposing/demanding these amendments”.Lawyer Prasanna S, who deals with privacy issues, said that the order sparked a debate about an “underlying principle of whether the platform companies should have as much censorial power — particularly when they have become an almost primary tool for exercise of political speech and political organising”.Twitter India refused to comment on the matter, other than pointing to the company’s response to the executive order which said: “This is a reactionary and politicized approach to such a landmark law. #Section230 protects American innovation and freedom of expression, and it’s underpinned by democratic values. Attempts to unilaterally erode it threaten the future of online speech and Internet freedoms.”But it may not be as black and white as that. Facebook chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg said in response to Twitter’s actions that social media platforms cannot be an “arbiter of truth”. His comments came ahead of the executive order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twitter-censors-provocative-trump-post-president-hits-back-with-order/story-Vc2hVM5EP0VjfzobssSelI.html
30-05-2020||India||FY20 growth stands at 11-yr low of 4.2%||The Indian economy grew by 3.1% in the three months ended March and 4.2% in 2019-20 on the back of falling investment and consumption, with the lockdown imposed to slow the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) having only a marginal impact because it affected only the last week of March. The lockdown, however, is expected to sharply affect growth in 2020-21, with many analysts estimating that the economy will actually shrink, perhaps by as much as 5% this financial year.The quarterly and annual numbers are against projections of 4.7% and 5% respectively, although it has been clear for some time that these will not materialise. Provisional accounts for 2019-20 released Friday showed that the fiscal deficit for the year was 4.59%.To be sure, the March quarter performance is better than expected. A Reuters poll of economists forecast a growth rate of 2.1% for the March quarter.The 3.1% growth in the March quarter is the lowest since March 2009, when, under the impact of the global financial crisis, the economy expanded by only 0.2%. The 4.2% growth in 2019-20 is an 11-year low.According to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), India’s gross domestic product (GDP) will shrink in 2020-21. This means that India’s GDP would have been in a deceleration phase for four consecutive years since 2017-18. This is unprecedented in post-Independence India. Friday’s data also shows that Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GCFC), a measure of investment, will contract by 2.8% in 2019-20. The Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy’s (CMIE) database shows that this is the worst investment performance since 1991-92. Core inflation, ie non-food non-fuel inflation, grew at 3.8% in 2019-20, the lowest since 2012-13, the earliest period for which data is available under the 2012 Consumer Price Index series. RBI reduced its policy rates in every quarter in 2019-20. A contraction in investment in a low interest low inflation environment suggests that it is lack of demand rather than availability of cost of capital which has led to this. Put the two together and it means that both investment and consumption, two pillars of the economy, are in trouble. The government announced a host a measures to boost the economy last year. The biggest among these was a reduction in corporate tax rates which was expected to reduce tax burden on companies by ~1.45 lakh crore in the month of September. The economy’s performance in the December and March quarters shows that they have not helped. Private Final Consumption Expenditure (PFCE) statistics support the weak demand argument. From a peak of 8.1% in 2017-18, it grew at just 5.3% in 2019-20. Government spending is the only head which has grown at a faster pace than 2018-19. However, Government Final Consumption Expenditure accounts for just 10% of the GDP. PFCE and GFCF have a share of 56% and 29%, respectively.Gross Value Added (GVA) figures for the March quarter also suggest that employment-intensive sectors in the non-farm sectors might have suffered a bigger hit due to the pandemic. Construction and trade, hotel and restaurants category has suffered the biggest reduction in growth rate between the December and March quarters. Manufacturing, which was already contracting in the September and December quarter, lost another 66 basis points in terms of growth in the March quarter. These three sectors account for 41% of India’s total employment. The index of eight core sector industries — coal, crude oil, natural gas, refinery, fertiliser, steel, cement and electricity — fell by 38% in the month of April. This suggests that non-farm activity, especially manufacturing and construction will not revive in the June quarter as well. The GDP figures reinforce a trend which was seen in the December numbers released on February 28. They show that the previous numbers were underestimating the economic slowdown. The latest figures highlight a downward revision of 16, 36, 66 and 64 basis points in the GDP growth figures for the March 2019, June 2019, September 2019 and the December 2019 quarter respectively. DK Aggarwal, president of PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry, expressed concern about the deceleration in GDP growth to the level of 3.1%. He, however, expressed optimism that the growth will revive in the second half of the financial year 2020-21 on the back of various reform measures announced by the government. The government has announced a slew of policy reforms and a revival package of ~20 lakh crore to help India cope with the Covid-19 pandemic and the impact of the lockdown imposed to fight it. “The stimulus package will re-fuel economic growth fundamentals of the economy and resume the lost economic activity, going forward,” he said in a statement.DK Srivastava, chief policy advisor at EY India, said the real GDP growth has fallen to 4.2% in 2019-20, the lowest since 2008-09 when it was 3.1%, due to a contraction in investment (-2.8%) and exports (-3.6%). “On the output side, there has been a fall mainly in manufacturing, construction as also in the two heavy-weight service sectors namely, trade, hotels, et al, and financial and real estate services. India is thus facing a problem of falling investment and savings and an acute problem of Covif-19-induced lockdown,” he added. Dilip Chenoy, secretary general of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci), said: “GDP numbers released today are on expected lines. The data reflects the impact on the economic situation due to actions on account of Covid-19. Growth slipped to 3.1% in the fourth quarter of 2019-20 and to 4.2% for the full fiscal year 2019-20 and this is the lowest since 2008-09.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fy20-growth-stands-at-11-yr-low-of-4-2/story-r7wrWsa1yRdWSfKCh8RMkI.html
30-05-2020||India||Ajit Jogi: A formidable leader and pivot of tribal politics dead at 74||Ajit Pramod Jogi, the first chief minister of Chhattisgarh, who died on Friday at the age of 74, was the pivot of tribal and dalit politics in the state carved out of Madhya Pradesh in 2000.He emerged as a formidable political force in the tribal-dominated state he led for three years from November 2000 at the helm of a Congress government. Left in awe by the power and charisma of a Parsi Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer who visited his village when he was a boy, Jogi always nursed the ambition of becoming a civil servant. A Marathi Brahmin teacher guided him in the direction by prodding him to learn English. Always brilliant in studies, Jogi went on to study mechanical engineering in Bhopal before achieving his ambition. He joined the Indian Police Service first, but while training in Mussoorie, he realized that IAS officers tended to treat officers of other services with condescension. He joined IAS in 1971, getting the eighth rank in the civil services examination, according to Union Public Service Commission records.Jogi served as collector for 12 years in different districts before resigning in 1986 and joining the Congress party. He was sent to the Rajya Sabha twice by the Congress, in 1986-92 and 1992-98.It was when he was serving as the collector in Raipur that Jogi became acquainted with Rajiv Gandhi, who was then an airline plot.“Rajiv ji was a pilot and when he used to come to Raipur , I visited him at airport. He always treated me as a friend.. We used to talk for hours on various issues in the VIP lounge of Raipur airport,” Jogi told this reporter in an interview in 2018.Rajiv Gandhi became the Prime Minister of India in 1984 after his mother and predecessor Indira was assassinated. In 1986, the Congress needed a tribal face to represent it in the Rajya Sabha and party politician Digvijay Singh suggested the name of Ajit Jogi. Within a day, Jogi resigned from the bureaucracy and entered politics. Owing to his sharp intellect and political acumen, Ajit Jogi rose up the ranks in the Congress and became party spokesman and when Chhattisgarh was created in 2000 became its first chief minister. His political fortunes declined because of infighting within the Congress. After defeat in the 2003 assembly elections, Jogi became the centre of many controversies.In the same year, the Bharatiya Janata Party released an audio tape purportedly to show he tried to break up the party’s Chhattisgarh unit by bribing its MLAs Fielded as the Congress candidate in the 2004 parliamentary election from Mahasamund constituency against Vidya Charan Shukla, who contested the poll on a BJP ticket, Jogi entered the Lok Sabha. It was during the campaign in Mahasamund that Jogi met with a road accident that left him wheelchair-bound. Jogi parted ways with the Congress in 2016 after he and his son were alleged to have fixed the Antahgarh byelection in Kanker district.In June 2016, Jogi formed his own party, the Janata Congress Chhattisgarh (J).In the 2018 assembly elections Jogi managed to win seven seats in a coalition with the Bahujan Samaj Party. Out of 90 assembly seats, Congress won 68 and the BJP was reduced to 15. Jogi himself won his traditional seat, MarwahiJogi suffered a cardiac arrest earlier this month and had been in a Raipur hospital since in a comatose state.He is survived by his wife Renu Jogi, MLA from Kota, and son Amit Jogi.Chief minister Bhupesh Baghel announced three days of state mourning for Jogi, who will be cremated with full state honours.“The death of the first Chief Minister of Chhattisgarh Shri Ajit Jogi is a major political loss for the state of Chhattisgarh. He will live on in the memories of all the people of the state,” tweeted Baghel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ajit-jogi-a-formidable-leader-and-pivot-of-tribal-politics-dead-at-74/story-Va3ifxnU28YinpEEaQVxoI.html
30-05-2020||India||Rising cases, positivity indicates need to expand, randomise testing||With Delhi registering more than 1,000 cases of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) for the second day in a row on Friday, the proportion of tests returning a positive result continued to rise even with the number of tests going up, prompting experts to call for a more aggressive and randomised testing strategy.With an average of 5,624 daily tests performed in the last seven days, the average daily positivity – or the percentage of people who test positive in the last week – was 12.6% for the week ending May 29. Last Friday, the average daily positivity rate for the seven days before it was 9.9% and the corresponding number was 6.4% for the week before. In the last 30 days, this average has nearly doubled from 6.5% on May 1 to 12.6% on May 29.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageDelhi’s positivity rate also remains much higher than the national average of 6.1% till Thursday, the latest this data was made available according to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).In the same time, the average number of samples tested in a week has increased to 5,624 on Friday, from 5,009 a week ago, according to data released by the Delhi government. To be sure, Delhi’s testing numbers have been the highest among the worst-hit regions in the country and the Capital has performed 10,075 tests for every million residents, nearly 3.5 times the national average.Experts pointed out that the positivity rate can be heavily influenced by a targeted testing strategy.“The positivity rate depends on the testing criteria. Who are you testing? If you are only testing those who are likely to have the infection such as someone from a containment zone with fever, then the positivity rate will be high. Having said that, the positivity rate is increasing along with the absolute number of cases as well, which shows that transmission is happening. And, India is on the upwards trend; the numbers are likely to go up further with travel being resumed,” said Dr GC Khilnani, chairman of PSRI Institute of Pulmonary and Critical Care and former head of the department of pulmonology at AIIMS.Dr Shobha Broor, former head of the department of microbiology at AIIMS, suggested that randomised antibody tests be conducted in the community to understand the underlying burden of the infection and the number of people who were asymptomatic carriers. “Sero-surveillance (population level monitoring of antibodies that remains in the blood even after the infection is cured) will help us in understanding the trend of the infection as well. And, it is likely that as more and more asymptomatic transmission happen, the virulence or the severity of the infection will reduce over a few months with it later becoming endemic,” she said.Delhi, as per national guidelines, has been testing all those with influenza like illness or severe acute respiratory infection and asymptomatic high-risk contacts of a person who has tested positive for Covid-19.In April-end, Delhi had started reporting huge pendency of samples, especially those collected from the containment zones hurting the city’s contact tracing measures. Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain had raised the issue on April 28 with the union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan, as the pendency was the highest at the centre-run National Institute of Biologicals in Noida. A day after the meeting, the government stopped sending samples to the laboratory till the pendency reduced.On May 4, the Delhi High Court directed the government to ensure that the samples are tested and reports provided within 48 hours.“Yes, we need to test more people to contain the spread of the infection by identifying cases and isolating them early on. However, there is a capacity of the laboratories – they still have the same number of staff, the tests take a few hours to perform, all biosafety measures have to be taken. So, even though in an ideal situation we should test the asymptomatic people, but currently we do not have the capacity to perform so many tests,” said Dr Broor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rising-cases-positivity-indicates-need-to-expand-randomise-testing/story-wRjdeDEFDfyBjO6QDKNFkI.html
30-05-2020||India||AgustaWestland case: Rajiv Saxena’s villa, bank accounts attached||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has attached assets worth $50.90 million (about Rs 385.44 crore), including a villa in Dubai’s Palm Jumeirah and five Swiss bank accounts, linked to AgustaWestland case suspect Rajiv Saxena.The villa is worth 20 million dirhams and the money attached in five accounts is worth $45.5 million, the agency, which probes financial crimes, said in a press statement on Friday. An accused-turned-approver in the ₹3,600-crore AgustaWestland helicopter deal, Saxena was deported to India from the UAE on January 31, 2019, and arrested under money laundering act. ED has claimed that Saxena, a Dubai-based businessman, is a hawala operator. ED and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) are probing allegations of corruption and money laundering in the 2007 contract for the purchase of 12 luxury VVIP helicopters for use by top leaders, including the President, Prime Minister and former PMs. The deal was cancelled on January 1, 2014 over the allegations of wrongdoing.ED has tried to get Saxena’s approver status revoked, claiming that he misled investigators and withheld crucial information. However, a Delhi court has refused to do so — a decision has been challenged by the agency in the high court.“Rajiv Saxena manages the proceeds of crime and tainted funds of many high profile and High Net worth Individuals (HNIs). He has admitted to laundering the proceeds of crime not only of AgustaWestland deal but also various other defence deals. The proceeds of crime have also been transferred to the personal accounts of Rajiv Saxena and his wife Shivani Saxena (also an accused in AgustaWestland case),” the ED press release said.Saxena’s lawyer, RK Handoo, said, “What’s happening is very wrong and is harassment of Rajiv Saxena by the agency. He was made an approver and then now agency is making these claims.”ED said Saxena is a “hawala operator who runs accommodation entry business in Dubai through numerous companies, known as Matrix group companies, and has laundered proceeds of crime in the cases of AgustaWestland chopper scam and Moser Baer bank fraud case”.The Moser Baer case is linked to businessman Ratul Puri, the nephew of former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Kamal Nath, and his father Deepak Puri. Ratul Puri, who denies any wrongdoing, was arrested in this case. He is out on bail. His lawyer, Vijay Aggarwal, refused to comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/agusta-rajiv-saxena-s-villa-bank-a-cs-attached/story-NcC8gG49j2JOX0vjAutA8K.html
30-05-2020||India||CBI kicks off probe into Tablighi funding||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has registered a Preliminary Enquiry (PE) to investigate “international linkages” and foreign funding of Tablighi Jamaat that has been in the news since a congregation it organised in Delhi in March was blamed for a jump in the Covid-19 infections, two officials familiar with the matter said. PE is the first step in CBI’s investigations and involves verifying irregularities to determine whether there is a need for filing a First Information Report.The officials said the initial probe will primarily focus on whether the Jamaat violated the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) while receiving donations from individuals or entities abroad. They added CBI has collected relevant probe documents from the Delhi police and is analysing the same. “We will look into financial operations of Tablighi Jamaat and people behind its funding here in India and abroad; antecedents of people associated with it and its sister organisations,” said one of the officers on condition of anonymity.CBI will also take copies of 47 charge sheets that the Delhi police filed this week against over 900 foreign members of the Jamaat, who attended the congregation at the group’s Nizamuddin headquarters in March, for violating visa conditions and Covid-19 lockdown rules. The Delhi police have also filed a criminal case against Jamaat chief Maulana Saad and its six other top officials for defying a series of government directives, which curbed religious and large gatherings to contain the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic.“CBI has registered a PE against organisers of Tablighi Jamaat and others on a complaint alleging that organizers and trustees of Jamaat were indulging into dubious cash transactions by using illegal/unfair means and also in non-disclosure of the receipts of foreign funds to the authorities,” said a CBI spokesperson.Another official said CBI is likely to summon Jamaat’s office-bearers in Delhi and other cities, including Saad, after studying all the documents. The official added if required, CBI may even take the help of foreign agencies at a later stage.The Enforcement Directorate is probing money laundering charges against the Jamaat and Saad and whether they used hawala networks to receive money. Terrorists belonging to Indian Mujahideen and IS-inspired operatives are believed to have attended Jamaat’s events but the organisation has never been named in any terror cases in India.Jamaat’s lawyer Fuzail Ayyubi did not respond to calls for his comments.The government blamed the Jamaat’s congregation for being responsible for almost 35% of Covid-19 cases in India till April 7. The headquarters of the group in New Delhi were sealed and its followers, including from Indonesia, Malaysia, and Bangladesh, were quarantined in March.

30-05-2020||India||1.85% of Shramik trains diverted due to route congestion: Railways||The railways operated 3,840 Shramik Special trains that ferried 5.2 million migrants since May 1 and only 71 trains, or 1.85%, were diverted because of route congestion, the national transporter said on Friday, defending itself against criticism of delays and poor services. At a press conference, railway board chairman VK Yadav also said that it was not possible for trains to get “lost”, referring to reports of trains bound for one state ending up in another state. “Out of 3,840 trains, 71 were diverted to deal with network congestion only between May 20 and May 24, as the railways had to meet demand of the respective states, nearly 90% of the trains were going to Uttar Pradesh and Bihar,” Yadav said.Among the 71 diverted trains, 51 were bound for Bihar, 16 for Uttar Pradesh, two for Jharkhand, and one each for Assam and Manipur. The trains had originated mainly from Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka and Rajasthan.“Only four trains took more than three days to reach the destination states in the north eastern part of the country,” Yadav clarified, adding that allegations of trains taking nearly nine days to reach destinations were incorrect.The national carrier had come under criticism over the delay and diversion of several Shramik trains in the last week. A Gorakhpur-bound train from Maharashtra ended up in Rourkela, Odisha, adding two days and five states to the original route.But the railways blamed route congestion for the chaos. With several Shramik Special trains bound for Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, the railways said last Sunday that the convergence of trains to these destinations caused the congestion in the network, and added that the total number of trains to the region had increased. Yadav said uncertainty in demand also led to the congestion. “As per railway capacity, it was not a 24-hour steady flow. The originations of Shramik Special trains took place after completing all the local protocols by the state mostly in post noon 16-24 shift. Thus, this left one-third route capacity per day to handle these trains,” he said.“On arrival, all passengers were registered and screened by state governments, which limited the capacity of terminals to handle trains. As against 20 minutes taken in normal trains, it took one to three hours in releasing the train at terminals,” he added.Demand for Shramik Special trains was diminishing, he said.“It appears that demand for these trains is declining from the originating state. 137 trains were flagged yesterday (Thursday) and 172 the day before (Wednesday). Demand for trains has been going down in the last two days,” Yadav said.Nearly 1,524 Shramik Specials were operated from May 22 to May 28 and ferried two million passengers. On May 20, as many as 279 trains ran.Last week, originating states had asked for 923 trains for migrants, but the number stood at 450 as of Thursday. Yadav said. “Railways has accommodated almost all requests received from the sending states and we are ready to meet all demand of Shramik movements. We will run Shramik Trains for as long as they are needed. Each and every migrant will be transported,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/1-85-of-shramik-trains-diverted-rly/story-n3zbB0LG0ZZ5uqfX7CQBwI.html
30-05-2020||India||Lockdown 4.0: Bengal to open religious places, Goa backs limited ops for malls||West Bengal announced the conditional reopening of places of worship and Goa favoured limited operations of malls, restaurants and gymnasiums on Friday, joining a growing chorus for more relaxations after the fourth phase of the lockdown ends on May 31.The developments came on the day home minister Amit Shah met Prime Minister Narendra Modi, less than 24 hours after Shah held t discussions on the phone with chief ministers on the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak.Shah briefed Modi about the suggestions and the feedback he received from chief ministers on the road ahead, news agency PTI quoted a government official as saying. The first anniversary of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led central government also featured in the talks between the two leaders, an official told HT on condition of anonymity.In West Bengal, chief minister Mamata Banerjee announced a slew of measures, including allowing government and private offices to work with their full staff from June 8. At present, offices in the state can function with 50% of staff strength.“From June 1, religious sites and places can open in West Bengal. But there will be no major congregation or celebration of any festival. Only 10 persons can gather at a religious place at any given time,” she said at the state secretariat. “Jute and tea industries will also be allowed to operate with 100% workforce from June 1,” she added. In Panaji, Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant backed extending the lockdown imposed to contain the spread of Covid-19 till June 15, but sought several relaxations such as reopening of malls, restaurants and gyms. He said these businesses can open with 50% of their staff capacity while strictly adhering to social distancing norms.Sawant said the state government is waiting for fresh lockdown guidelines from the Union home ministry, which is expected to release them by Sunday when the fourth phase ends.The nationwide lockdown — the first phase was imposed on March 25 for 21 days — has been extended thrice. The second and the third phases of the curbs — beginning April 15 and May 4 — lasted 19 days and 14 days, respectively. According to the federal guidelines applicable to the period between May 18 and May 31, malls, gymnasiums and dine-in restaurants are to be shut across the country. Metro train services, international passenger flights, schools and colleges, hospitality services, cinema halls, and religious and political gatherings, too, are prohibited. Though states can frame their own guidelines, they have been advised not to dilute the rules framed by the Centre.A Karnataka government official said the stated had opened most sectors and life is back to normal except in containment zones, which can be broadly defined as the epicentre of an infection with strict perimeter controls. “Only some decisions such as running the metro and opening of malls, shopping complexes and movie theatres...are still restricted. We will await the Centre’s directive when the current lockdown ends on 31 May and take appropriate decisions based on that,” said the official who did not want to be named.In telephone conversations with home minister Shah — which took place just three days before the end of the fourth phase of the lockdown — several chief ministers wanted the lockdown to continue in some form but at the same time favoured opening up of economic activities and gradual return of the normal life, PTI reported. Shah sought to know the areas of concern of the states and the sectors they want open from June 1, according to the report.Andhra Pradesh chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy suggested to Shah that more relaxations be given if the Centre decides to extend the lockdown. Jagan Reddy explained what steps his government was taking to contain Covid-19 in the state, an official in the chief minister’s office said.(With inputs from state bureaus and agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-to-open-religious-places-goa-backs-malls/story-lbCOThJtCqukeiLtANJT3L.html
30-05-2020||India||Centre flags 145 districts as potential Covid-19 hotspots||The central government has identified 145 new districts, mostly rural, that have reported Covid-19 infections over the past three weeks and warned that they could emerge as “epicentres” of the disease if effective containment measures are not undertaken. In a presentation to representatives of states on Thursday, cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba highlighted that eastern India was likely to be the next big Covid-19 hotspot with the return of migrant workers from the worst-hit states. The cabinet secretary said 12 states, including Bihar, West Bengal and Odisha in eastern India which had not reported many cases earlier, have witnessed rapid infection spread in the three weeks until May 25. Other states such as Tripura and Manipur, too, have reported an increase in Covid-19 cases after having infections in single digits earlier.Also Read: Covid-19: What you need to know todayThe health ministry said bigger states such as Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Delhi, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh accounted for the bulk of India’s around 1,65,000 cases until Thursday. There has been a faster increase in the cases over in the past fortnight. India had reported 75,000 cases until May 13. The ministry said the bigger states remained the main contributors to the surge but that states such as Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh and Odisha saw sharp increase in cases.“It is primarily because of the return of migrant workers from Covid-19 hotspot states like Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh that the cases increased in eastern India,” said an official on condition of anonymity. “As the rush of migrant workers was huge, there was no proper screening of passengers at railway and bus stations. Therefore, many took infections from one state to another.”Also Read: Govt may plan scheme for welfare, jobs of migrantsThe ministry has identified the 145 districts, where state governments need to “proactively” conduct containment activities to ensure that new epicentres do not emerge. According to the presentation, 2,147 active cases in these districts account for 2.5% of the total cases in India. Of these, 26 districts have more than 20 active cases.Half of these districts are in Assam, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha and Madhya Pradesh. Bihar health secretary Lokesh Kumar Singh said the government is concerned as migrant workers account for around two-thirds of about 3,200 cases in the state. Jharkhand minister Rameshwar Oran said only a few cases have been reported from outside quarantine centres, which shows the virus has not spread. “We have been able to control the spread even though a large number of workers returned from infected places.” Odisha’s additional chief secretary, Pradipta Kishore Mohapatra, said the state’s Covid-19 recovery rate of 41% was better than the national average of 42%. “None of the new Covid patients is in ICU [intensive care units] or [on] ventilator [support] and we are confident of overcoming the crisis once all migrant workers return.”The health ministry also expressed concern over an increase in the Covid-19 confirmation rate, or the positives for total tests done, in some states such as Delhi, Maharashtra and Bihar. Most states have recorded a fall in the Covid-19 fatality rate even as it increased in Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat between May 18 and May 25, according to the ministry. The fatality rate has declined from 8.5% to 7.1% in West Bengal but was remains the highest for any major state.Former Indian Medical Association president Dr K K Agarwal said the fatality and the confirmation rates in India were still less than the western countries. “Everybody expected the cases to increase ; it does not mean the lockdown failed. The lockdown has helped us to contain the spread.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-flags-145-districts-as-potential-covid-19-hot-spots/story-Pv5VXDKzb4Iyl589YoTOSM.html
30-05-2020||India||Meant to eradicate locusts, pesticides affect soil, crops||The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) of the United Nations said on Friday that it may declare the locust invasion a plague if it takes a turn for the worse after breeding by the voracious, crop-crunching insects in India, Pakistan and West Africa. FAO now categorises the locust invasion that has reached India as an “upsurge”. Swarms of desert locusts have chomped through vegetation and crops across farm lands in Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. The Locust Warning Organisation (LWO) sprayed Malathion 96 and Chlorpyrifos, both organophosphate pesticides, to control the locust swarms across states. Both are extremely toxic and high level of exposure to the pesticides may cause nausea, dizziness and even death. They can also impact soil fertility by altering the ecological balance.“We have conducted control operations in 47,000 ha in Rajasthan, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh by spraying pesticides,” said KL Gurjar, deputy director of the LWO. A swarm near Jhansi in UP has scattered. Gurjar said there is no clear indications the locusts will head towards Delhi.FAO, saying it may declare a plague of locusts, cautioned that farmers shouldn’t try to control the swarms. “Unfortunately, spraying of chemical insecticides is the only effective method when desert locusts are in such large numbers. There are bio-pesticides which are safe ways of controlling them, but may not be as effective. FAO doesn’t encourage control of desert locusts by farmers. State or federal teams that are trained in locust invasion management should do it with safety equipment,” said Keith Cressman, senior locust forecasting officer at FAO, at a webinar organised by the Centre for Science and Environment on Friday. One of the options with farmers is to dig trenches around their farms to prevent hoppers from entering. Noise can scatter locusts, but they prevent focused control operations by the authorities as the swarms move in different directions.Cressman said the current severe locust invasion was linked to climate change-induced aberrations in rainfall. “There was good breeding in India last year, the monsoon was protracted which allowed further increase in locust populations. The drying vegetation in south-west Pakistan also led to them reaching India a month in advance,” he said. India was alerted by FAO last year about the possibility of waves of invasions. The desert locusts were expected to remain limited to its habitat in Rajasthan, but the swarms scattered to Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra because of the strong north-westerly winds following cyclone Amphan, which struck West Bengal and Odisha on May 20.“Except for Malathion 96, the rest that they are spraying are highly poisonous pesticides. They are red-labelled. They are meant for locust control in desert areas which are largely uninhabited. But the same pesticides are being sprayed on in areas with habitation and with water bodies. These pesticides will drift and residue will remain. They will definitely disturb the ecological balance of the area and kill natural enemies—pests which can counter other crop pests. So, we can expect outbreak of other pests,” said GV Ramanjaneyulu, executive director at the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture. “Desert locusts don’t multiply in non-desert areas so there is no point in spraying toxic pesticides in such large quantities in other states. They have a short life cycle and will die in due course. Government must consider biocontrol agents,” he added. With the onset of monsoon rains, the locusts will come back to their summer breeding sites in the desert along the India-Pakistan border. “They will be flying back and forth with the winds till monsoon arrives,” Cressman said.The other forecast that FAO has made is that with the south-west monsoon winds, desert locusts that bred in the Horn of Africa will travel to Rajasthan across the Indian Ocean in June.“Spraying of insecticides is compounding environmental problems in the Horn of Africa. We do not have wherewithal to undertake these measures at the scale required, we need aircraft to spray, expertise to spray. Biotechnological interventions should be considered…locust invasions are an existential challenge if they are allowed...in the coming years,” Richard Mark Mbaram, technical adviser to the Nigerian ministry of agriculture, said||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/meant-to-eradicate-locusts-pesticides-affect-soil-crops/story-hotty6JrfYyCXP4h1C4ZON.html
30-05-2020||India||India, China reject US bid to mediate on border issue||The Indian government on Friday doubled down on its rejection of US President Donald Trump’s offer to mediate on the border standoff with China, with people familiar with development contradicting the American leader’s remarks that he had discussed the “big conflict” with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.China too rejected Trump’s offer of mediation, and foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said the two countries don’t need the intervention of a third party as they have existing mechanisms to resolve problems. China’s foreign and defence ministries described the situation at the border as “stable and controllable”.The reactions from New Delhi and Beijing came hours after Trump reiterated his offer to mediate between India and China to resolve the standoff between border troops of the two countries at a briefing at the White House early on Friday (Indian time).Trump initially made the offer to mediate through a tweet on Wednesday. Though it was tacitly turned down by India’s external affairs ministry on Thursday, he went a step further and said on Friday that Modi was “not in a good mood” regarding the “big conflict” with China.The people cited above, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the last conversation between Modi and Trump had occurred long before the standoff with China became public, and the discussion had centred around the US request for supply of hydroxychloroquine to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic.“There has been no recent contact between Prime Minister Modi and President Trump. The last conversation between them was on April 4 on the subject of hydroxychloroquine,” said one of the people cited above.“Yesterday [Thursday], the external affairs ministry had made it clear that we are directly in touch with the Chinese through established mechanisms and diplomatic contacts,” the person added.This is the second time New Delhi has called out such a claim by Trump regarding mediation between India and another country. In July 2019, India dismissed Trump’s remarks, at a joint news briefing with Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan, that Modi had asked him to help resolve the Kashmir issue.At that time too, Trump contended he had spoken directly with Modi about Kashmir. “And he actually said, ‘Would you like to be a mediator, or arbitrator? I said ‘Where?’, and he said ‘Kashmir, because this has been going on for many many years’,” Trump had said at the time.Trump created a flutter on Wednesday with his tweet about mediating to end the standoff: “We have informed both India and China that the United States is ready, willing and able to mediate or arbitrate their now raging border dispute. Thank you!”After studied silence for a day, the external affairs ministry cleared the air at its weekly briefing on Thursday. Asked about Trump’s offer, ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava ruled out any role for a third party in addressing the border tensions: “As I’ve told you, we are engaged with the Chinese side to peacefully resolve this issue.”Despite the position adopted by India, Trump reiterated his offer to arbitrate when he was asked by an Indian reporter about the border standoff at the White House briefing.Prefacing his offer to mediate with the comment that “they like me in India”, Trump said: “They have a big conflict going with India and China. Two countries with 1.4 billion people, two countries with very powerful militaries. And India is not happy, and probably China is not happy. But I can tell you, I did speak to Prime Minister Modi. He’s not – he’s not in a good mood about what’s going on with China.”Asked specifically if he would mediate between India and China, Trump replied: “I would do that. You know, I would do that. If they – if they thought it would help if I were the mediator or the arbiter, I would do that. So, we’ll see.”In Beijing, foreign ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian rejected the US offer to mediate by saying: “Between China and India, we have existing border-related mechanisms and communication channels. We are capable of properly resolving the issues between us through dialogue and consultation. We do not need the intervention of the third party.”Both Zhao and, for the first time, defence ministry spokesperson Senior Colonel Ren Guoqiang described the situation at the border as “stable and controllable”.“The two sides have the ability to communicate and solve relevant issues through the established border-related mechanisms and diplomatic channels,” Ren said in an online media interaction on Thursday.Zhao told a regular news briefing on Friday: “We have been implementing the important consensus reached by leaders of both countries, observing the bilateral agreements and have been committed to safeguarding territorial sovereignty and security, stability and peace in the border area.”The statements from China’s foreign and defence ministries were perceived as a sign that, at least as of now, the government isn’t willing to let the situation worsen through a war of words with India.To be sure, India has rejected China’s assertion that Indian troops carried out illegal constructions across the Line of Actual Control (LAC).Arun Singh, who served as India’s envoy to the US during 2015-16, described Trump’s mediation offer as an effort to “project that he is influential internationally”.“The US president is erratic and unpredictable and even Twitter is hiding his tweets. I’m sure even he wasn’t expecting a positive response from India or China. We should ignore it and move on,” Singh said.China’s state-run media too dismissed Trump’s proposal.“The latest dispute can be solved bilaterally by China and India. The two countries should keep alert on the US, which exploits every chance to create waves that jeopardise regional peace and order,” the nationalistic Global Times tabloid said in a comment piece.The article titled “China, India don’t need US help on their frictions” further said: “It seems Trump finally knows that China and India, the two largest Asian powers, share borders. Early this year, A Very Stable Genius, a book written by two Washington Post journalists, revealed that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was shocked and concerned when Trump told him India and China did not share a border.”It noted India had turned down Trump’s offer last year to mediate on the Kashmir issue, and that India “perhaps has been aware of the US’ bad history of mediation in which the US made troubles rather than solved problems”.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has said that the government must come clean on the border face-off between India and China along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).“The Government’s silence about the border situation with China is fueling massive speculation and uncertainty at a time of crisis. GOI must come clean and tell India exactly what’s happening,” Gandhi tweeted on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-china-reject-us-bid-to-mediate-on-border-issue/story-nZWAd5QJAkzqzpuAjMwsiM.html
30-05-2020||India||Must adapt to e-courts, says Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad||Union law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Friday said the world would not be the same post-Covid and asked lawyers to adapt to effectively use the digital and physical court processes as India’s future lies in digital technology.“The post-Covid world will be a different world. It won’t be the same. We must begin to prepare ourselves for the digital courts and physical courts must go together with one supplementing the other,” he said in a speech as part of a series of memorial lectures organized in educationist N R Madhava Menon’s memory.Prasad, who also holds communications, electronics, and information technology portfolio, said that with the help of technology, over 16,000 courts have been digitised. He added the second phase of e-filing of cases has been launched in the Supreme Court. Prasad said trial courts have been able to conduct e-trials through virtual examination of witnesses and recording of evidence in nearly 200,000 cases.He spoke about future technologies and challenges they could pose for lawyers. “Artificial intelligence [AI] will play a crucial role in the coming times. You [lawyers] need to coordinate with new ideas of technology to accelerate the justice delivery system. But the human mind will continue to play its role as AI cannot cross-examine. That only a lawyer can do.”He cited the example of driverless cars to show how machines cannot take the place of human consciousness. “Driverless car technology is good but I am worried that if such a car gets involved in an accident, who should be held responsible.” He stressed privacy too and promised a robust Data Protection law.Prasad praised indigenously developed digital products like the Mitron app and expressed his confidence that the “innate abilities of Indians” and “divine entity of India” will help the country to deliver solutions to the Covid-19 crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/must-adapt-to-e-courts-prasad/story-xIxPf7zQRQ0ZvB33KTl8tL.html
30-05-2020||India||Kids have 56% lower chance of catching Covid-19 infection: Study||In a finding that has implications for the reopening of schools, a new study has found that children and teenagers carry about half the risk that adults do of being infected by Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). It is still not clear whether children are also less likely to spread the infection to others.Children are 56% less likely than adults to get infected by the virus when they come in contact with an infected person, according to the study by researchers at the University College London, which was published in the preprint journal medRxiv. The study has not yet been peer-reviewed.“There is preliminary evidence that children and young people have lower susceptibility to Sars-CoV-2, with 56% lower odds of being an infected contact. There is weak evidence that children and young people play a lesser role in transmission of Sars-CoV-2 at a population level. Our study provides no information on the infectivity of children,” said the report, which analysed data from 6,327 studies that had been published till May 16, 2020.The role of children and young people in spreading the disease depends on several factors, including their susceptibility to infection, severity of symptoms, viral load, social contact patterns, and risk behaviour. Clinical series and testing of symptomatic cases alone gives biased estimates of susceptibility in children, who often don’t develop symptoms.“The susceptibility of children to Sars-Cov2 is low, according to most of the information. If they are asymptomatic, as most are, transmission risk will be very low,” said Dr K Srinath Reddy, president, Public Health Foundation of India.Studies on Covid-19 prevalence in children have produced widely varying results, noted the University College London analysis. Large studies from Iceland, the Netherlands and Spain and Italy showed markedly lower Sars-CoV-2 prevalence among children and young people, but studies from Sweden, England and some cantons in Switzerland and Germany found no difference in infection prevalence between adults and children.The Swedish Public Health Agency found 4.7% antibody prevalence in children and teenagers, compared with 6.7% in adults aged 20 to 64, and 2.7% in 65- to 70-year-olds.“Long-lasting school closures not only lead to a loss of learning but the isolation also harms their mental health and social development, so we have to consider whether the harm outweighs the infection risk for children, who can spread it to their families, school staff and the community,” said Dr Rajesh Sagar, professor in the department of psychiatry, All India Institute of Medical Sciences.Most schools in India have been closed since March 21, the weekend before a national lockdown was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 24.Unlike Sweden, which kept day care centres and schools through the ninth grade open without major adjustments to class size, lunch policies, or recess rules, schools in India are unlikely to open before July as the authorities attempt to lower children’s exposure to the risk of infection.“Most young children find it difficult to follow social distancing norms and given the large number of students in one classroom, and crowded transport and playgrounds, schools can easily turn into infection clusters if children infect teachers or take the infection to their family and neighbourhood even if they don’t get severe disease themselves,” said Dr Sagar, who specialises in child mental health.Socially- and economically disadvantaged children who depend on schools for midday meals, education, nutrition and health are among the worst hit by prolonged school closure. “School provides a structured setting in which children can learn and develop social competencies, such as self-confidence, friendship, empathy, participation, respect, gratitude, compassion, and responsibility. Social and emotional learning is important for young people to become conscious members of a solidarity-based community,” according to a paper on rethinking the role of the school after Covid-19, published in The Lancet.A hybrid model of education with greater dependence on e-learning is being used in many countries that are reopening schools post lockdown, but it has its challenges. “Since all children do not have access to online learning because of uneven access, teaching using radio and television should be considered as that group cannot be ignored,” Dr Sagar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kids-have-56-lower-chance-of-catching-infection-study/story-F2dE3FQxCxtQcnDxNo089M.html
30-05-2020||India||During Covid-19 lockdown, births at clinics plummet by 40%||Savitri Devi, 22, of Lucknow’s Narsingh Khera village, delivered a baby boy at her house on the first day of lockdown . The lockdown prevented her from travelling to a government-run health care centre where she would have otherwise given birth. Mother and son are fine but her story is the story of thousands of women who delivered children at home because they couldn’t travel to the nearest community health centre or a hospital . Data from states such as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Jharkhand, Odisha and Chhattisgarh shows that the number of institutional deliveries may have fallen by as much as 40% during the lockdown. That’s significant because institutional deliveries are believed to be behind the major strides India has made in reducing maternal and infant mortality in recent decades. “Institutional delivery improves survival chances for a newborn manifold,” said Sayeeda Hamid, who was member in-charge of health in the Planning Commission for a decade till 2014. . “It is sad that institutional deliveries have come down but, I think, it is a temporary phase because of the lockdown. State governments should ensure proper supplements for mothers and their kids through Asha workers,” she said. Infant mortality rate (IMR) has fallen from 129 per 1,000 live births in 1971 to 32 in 2018, according to Census Commissioner of India’s website. The biggest dip in IMR was between 2008 and 2018 with improvement in health infrastructure in rural areas. Similarly, the maternal mortality rate has fallen from 22 in 2008 to 12 per 1,000 live births in 2018, according to National Institution for Transforming India (NITI) Aayog.According to National Family Health Survey, the proportion of institutional deliveries in India has increased from 38.7% in 2005-6 to 78.9% in 2015-16 due to improvement in rural health infrastructure and the presence of health workers in every village to monitor health of pregnant woman.“Bihar reported 90,000 institutional deliveries during the first 30 days of the lockdown (March 25 to April 25), as compared to an average of 1.50 lakh deliveries a month,” a Bihar government health department official said on condition of anonymity. In Uttar Pradesh, the institutional deliveries in April was 98,515 compared to a monthly average of 1,12,681,said Mithilesh Chaturvedi, UP’s director, family welfare, adding that instructions have been issued to ensure all expecting mothers are admitted and those symptomatic, tested for Covid. Jharkhand’s health secretary Nitin Kulkarni said that institutional deliveries in May dropped to 35,000 as compared to monthly average of about 50,000 in the first four months of this calendar year. “As compared to 80% institutional delivery rate in Jharkhand in 2019, the number during the lockdown period is around 55%,” said Dr Shailesh Chourasia, managing director, national health mission.In Chhattisgarh, only 20,013 institutional deliveries were recorded in the month of April, as compared to 30,629 in the previous month. The number has witnessed slight increase in May but it is still less than the monthly average of about 34,000 institutional deliveries, officials said. “People in villages are hesitant to come out thinking they would not be able to return to their villages. Moreover, non-Covid services were not available in most of the hospitals,” explained Deepak Soni, the collector of Dantewada district , which has seen the highest proportion of home deliveries in the state. According to health department officials in West Bengal, institutional deliveries have reduced by around 25-30% during lockdown. “On an average around one lakh institutional deliveries take place every month. During the lock down it has gone down to around 70,000 to 75,000,” said a health department official, who asked not to be named. Most rivate nursing homes in the state were closed in April. Odisha’s director family welfare, L Mishra, said that there has been some decrease in the institutional deliveries , but not much, because Odisha was the first state to have exclusive Covid-19 hospital that did not hamper routine hospital work in other government hospitals. “Close to 80% of the births took place in government run institutions during the lockdown period in April and May, 2020,” he said.Those women fortunate enough to get to a hospital or a health centre in time, did so after jumping through hoops.  Radha Kumari, delivered a baby girl, her first child, at the Patna Medical College Hospital (PMCH) on Friday morning, but after her husband Golu Kumar, 21, a tile mason, ran around -- from a private hospital to a government run medical centre to PMCH. . They reached PMCH at 4am on Friday and had to wait for several hours to get a bed. Finally, Kumari delivered a baby girl around 11 am.In Uttar Pradesh’s Mathura district, Rajender Kumar hired a taxi for Rs 5,000 to take his wife Geeta, to the district hospital, 20 km away from their home. “There was no response at the government helpline number. I called a taxi owner, who agreed after much persuasion. At the hospital, they (hospital administration) refused to admit her saying she did not have a Covid free certificate. They later allowed her entry when I signed an undertaking that hospital will not be responsible if she tests positive for Covid,” he said. In Narsingh Khera, Savitri Devi’s troules didn’t end with the birth of the child. She and her husband are now struggling to ensure post-birth check-ups for her and also or the child.

30-05-2020||India||Govt may plan scheme for welfare, jobs of migrants||The Narendra Modi government may consider an ambitious, targeted programme to ensure welfare and jobs for millions of migrants who have returned home during the Covid19 pandemic. According to officials directly familiar with the plan, the programme may start in June and go on for four months at the least and provide either jobs or cash to the people who have returned to their hometowns and villages after losing employment in the cities they had migrated to following the nationwide lockdown. The programme, however, may not entail any additional support from the exchequer, the officials explained. Existing centrally sponsored schemes such as MGNREGS and scholarships will be tweaked to address the extraordinary situation, they said. The finance ministry announced a ₹20 lakh crore stimulus package earlier this month to help individuals, businesses and states to cope with the pandemic and the impact of the lockdown imposed to fight it. Many of the measures announced in the package, especially those for small businesses, agriculture and the rural sector, will also come handy for the government to support welfare and financial plans for migrant labourers, the officials added. Around 9.1 million migrant workers have already returned to their homes.Preparing the ground for the big-ticket plan, the government’s machinery has already started mapping districts that have received 25,000 or more migrant workers, the officials said. Those areas with a higher concentration of migrants would see an early roll-out of the plan. The final decision on the plan, according to them, will be taken by the PMO. “Millions of workers have returned to their villages and not all of them will be interested in digging earth under MGNREGS. They have a wide variety of expertise and we need to address their needs through a bouquet of welfare programmes, using MSMEs,and rural or agricultural schemes,” said one of the officials. According to this person if approved, the programme could be launched by June. A second official pointed out that centrally-sponsored and central sector schemes already have the capacity to adapt to rising demand. They further argue that as these schemes are monitored and executed directly by the union government, it is easier to use them for such exigencies. The second official added that it’s not required to further dig into the exchequer for rolling out such a targeted programme as funds are already tied up for each scheme. “Such a targeted programme, if it is approved and executed, has a dual advantage: It can help millions of distressed workers and maximize the potential of government schemes and the stimulus package,” said the first official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-may-plan-scheme-for-welfare-jobs-of-migrants/story-jRxtYZn6QJBMnWnKpgvdUM.html

Thousands of pilgrims either take the traditional and longer 45km-long Pahalgam route or the shorter 14km-long Baltal route to Amarnath, one of Hinduism’s holiest shrines, every year. The pilgrimage usually spans nearly a month-and-a-half and takes place during July and August.The government decided in February on a 42-day pilgrimage to the holy cave shrine. It was scheduled to begin from the twin tracks of Pahalgam in Anantnag district and Baltal in Ganderbal district on June 23 and end on August 3 on the day of Shravan Purnima (Raksha Bandhan).Last year, the Amarnath Yatra was cut short following intelligence inputs of terror threats||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/14-day-amarnath-yatra-to-start-from-july-21/story-HVkc1ZZZkSM2zJuLDcBieO.html
30-05-2020||India||Food Corporation of India dominates wheat procurement||India’s private sector has nearly exited the country’s foodgrain markets, pushed out by high levies and bonuses on wheat and rice, and resulted in a virtual monopoly of state-run Food Corporation of India (FCI), latest procurement figures of wheat show. This leaves farmers with little incentive to grow crops other than rice and wheat in food bowl states like Punjab, Madhya Pradesh and Haryana. High taxes and extra bonuses in some states, offered as a top-up to federally determined minimum support prices (MSP), are the main reasons for the private sector being “crowded out”, leaving FCI as the only buyer in the grain bowls of Punjab, Madhya Pradesh and Haryana, analysts say. According to official figures as on May 24, procurement of wheat by government agencies has touched 34.1 million tonnes, which is slightly more than last year’s levels.Experts say FCI, India’s main grain handling agency, is burdened with mountains of wheat and rice stocks, often beyond its capacity. For instance, total food stocks owned by FCI exceed its total capacity for protected and scientific storage, technically called covered and plinth, or CAP. Take for instance this year’s rate of procurement, or the buying of wheat at statutory minimum support prices by the FCI. Punjab has procured 12.65 million tonnes of wheat against market arrivals of 12.7 million tonnes, which is 99.5% of total stocks offered by farmers for sale. In Madhya Pradesh, government agencies have procured 11.33 million tonnes, which is nearly 99% of the total arrivals of 11.40 million tonnes. In Haryana, the state’s agencies have procured 7.06 million tonnes, nearly 95% of market arrivals.“Private buyers have almost completely withdrawn from Punjab. One reason is taxes and arhatiya commission of about 8.5% on the wheat purchase,” said Siraj Hussain, a senior visiting fellow of the think-tank ICRIER. Hussain is the country’s former agriculture secretary.According to Hussain, Punjab stores some of its wheat in an unscientific manner that is prone to damage due to rains. FCI’s general manager of procurement, KC Sahu, did not take calls. An email containing queries were sent to him.The exit of the private sector from grain markets was highlighted by a high-level committee headed by former food minister Shanta Kumar. The Narendra Modi government formed the panel in 2015 to overhaul the 50-year-old FCI. “The HLC [high-level committee] also notes that private sector has been crowded out not only in states that give extra bonus but also those that charge very high statutory levies and commissions, which vary from 3.6 percent in Rajasthan to 14.5 percent in Punjab in case of wheat in 2012-13,” the panel said in its report to Modi.Crowding out refers to a situation where increased government involvement in a sector affects other players, including the private sector. “With the government procuring only wheat, what is the incentive for farmers to grow crops such as maize, channa or mustard? Farmers, who are able to sell wheat, paddy or sugarcane at prices fixed by the government, do not deserve Rs 6,000 a year as cash hand-out under PM-KISAN. Farmers, whose crops are not procured, should receive at least Rs 10,000 under PM-KISAN. The farmers in rain-fed areas should get even more,” Hussain said.The Shanta Kumar committee report had said “bonuses distort the market, encouraging farmers to produce and sell more of wheat and rice to the government agencies, crowding out the private sector from that state”. In some states, it said, the “procurement by government agencies goes to 60-80 percent of marketed surplus”. “This is nothing short of a monopolistic situation in the market, with just one large buyer [the state agencies].”To get private companies back to grain markets, the committee recommended that “state-level bonuses [some states declare bonus over and above the MSP declared by the central government] must be contained, taxes and statutory levies made uniform at 3% of MSP, levies on rice millers abolished and quality of grain be adhered to through mechanical and transparent processes.” The government never took up the report for implementation. “Some of its proposals, such as restricting subsidised grains to 40% of the population were politically risky,” a retired food ministry official said, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fci-dominates-wheat-procurement/story-lwWeXb2IcSE9HSaM1jMZBK.html
30-05-2020||India||UGC to bring norms for e-degree courses||The University Grants Commission is set to bring in regulations for online degree courses, officials familiar with the matter said.The development has come after the ministry of human resource development asked the country’s top 100 universities to offer such courses amid the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. Members of the commission, in a meeting on Friday, discussed the contours of the regulations which will be similar to those for open learning courses.“It is likely that an integrated set of regulations for distance and online learning can soon be brought out by the UGC. There is a general agreement that courses which are high on practical content like engineering or others will not be offered through online education. However, courses where there is less of practical training are ideal for such teaching. Moreover, subjects like coding can also be taught,” said a senior official, requesting anonymity.Even with integrated regulations, there may be clauses specifically for online courses, the official cited above said. The reason for bringing in regulations is mainly to address quality concerns related to such courses, he said.The higher education regulator has already decided that it will lower the bar for varsities to offer online and distance learning courses from the earlier benchmark 3.26 score by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) at least for one academic year.It is also likely that varsities will be given a free hand in offering diploma and certificate courses online, said another official. Following the outbreak of the coronavirus disease, the HRD ministry has been focusing on popularising the online mode of education as classroom teaching appears increasingly difficult.In her budget speech earlier this year, Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said that the country’s top 100 educational institutions will start offering full-fledged degree courses online. Sitharaman had again mentioned online courses while announcing the relief measures to alleviate the effect of the pandemic on the economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ugc-to-bring-norms-for-e-degree-courses/story-DbCrCZSOo4iPI1H93oCe8K.html
30-05-2020||India||Centre may announce 2nd stimulus to increase demand after lockdown is lifted||The government may unveil another stimulus package of fiscal, monetary and policy measures to boost demand in the economy after the nationwide lockdown imposed for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic is completely lifted, three officials familiar with the development said on Friday.A thorough assessment of the Rs 20.97 lakh crore Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan (Self-Reliant India Mission) will precede the likely announcement, the officials said, requesting anonymity. Some critics have said the package of fiscal and monetary measures, which included past announcements, didn’t go far enough to address the economic fallout of Covid-19 and the ensuing lockdown.Also read| Covid-19: What you need to know todayThe government has kept all its “options open” and will respond with appropriate measures to streamline supplies and boost demand to put the economy on a higher growth trajectory, one of the officials, who has direct knowledge of the matter, said.The other two officials said the next package, which is expected at least after a month, will fill the gaps that could have been left by the series of measures already announced since March 26. The package would be prepared after discussions with all stakeholders in the economy, they said.The government is concerned about slack in demand in the economy despite the series of fiscal and monetary measures announced in the last two months, the officials said. One sign of weak demand is the poor credit offtake despite banks reporting record loan sanctions.Also read: FY20 growth stands at 11-year low of 4.2%According to the finance ministry, public sector banks (PSBs) sanctioned loans worth Rs 6.45 lakh crore in just two-and-a-half months, between March 1 and May 15, to about 5.5 million accounts, but officials said the actual disbursal was minimal. According to the finance ministry, loan disbursal will start after the lockdown is lifted. Phase four of the lockdown is set to end on May 31. “The industry does need money, particularly MSMEs. It is good that the money has been sanctioned, now disbursal should happen as soon as possible,” HT quoted Niranjan Hiranandani, president of the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (Assocham), as saying in a report published on May 8.Experts say that borrowers are reluctant to avail of the sanctioned loans because they do not immediately see sufficient demand in the economy.On May 22, the Reserve Bank of India slashed policy rates by 40 basis points (bps) and extended a moratorium on repayment of loans by another three months to provide relief to borrowers caught in the economic fallout of Covid-19. It was the third monetary intervention since March 27; The Atmanirbhar Bharat Package included RBI measures worth ₹8.01 lakh crore.Commenting on the RBI decision, securities firm Nomura said: “While the policy easing is welcome, the effectiveness of rate cuts and excess liquidity (on delivering the growth bang) is incrementally diminishing in a scenario of rising credit risk aversion (among lenders).”The first official mentioned above admitted that the “disbursal and sanction mismatch” was a matter of concern to the government, which is examining the matter.The government’s relief packages are meant to provide temporary support and help in kickstarting the economy, said DK Srivastava, chief policy advisor at EY India. “Growth calls for a straight-forward push to demand, particularly investment demand. To kickstart this, it is the government’s capital expenditure that should play a pivotal role. By augmenting this, private investment would also increase through multiplier effects,” he said.According to officials, the cash-strapped government is not in favour of raising taxes on non-essential items as that could further depress demand.Although dwindling Goods and Services Tax (GST) revenue is a concern for both the Centre and states, the Union government is not in favour of raising taxes on non-essential items because that could be detrimental for demand generation, the first official said.The government has not yet released the monthly GST collection data for April, which is expected to be one-third of the March collection (Rs 97,597 crore) because economic activity was negligible during the lockdown period. GST collections had exceeded Rs 1 lakh crore for four consecutive months since November 2019. The GST Council is expected to meet in June to discuss a sharp decline in revenue collection and could also consider raising money from the market to compensate states for their revenue shortfall, the other two officials said.They said the economy had been battered by a prolonged lockdown since March and its revival needs a series of booster doses.“The first round of announcements worth over ₹20 lakh crore was completed just on May 17. This is not all. There are more to come depending on how the economy respond to the stimulus already announced,”one of the officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-may-announce-second-stimulus-to-increase-demand/story-TxDCRiEkEmi6By5KrUpg1L.html
30-05-2020||India||Atmanirbhar plan covers credit for traders: Union Minister Piyush Goyal||The ₹3 lakh crore credit guarantee facility extended to micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) under the Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan (Self-Reliant India Initiative) also covers traders, minister of commerce and industry Piyush Goyal has clarified.Traders can access easy loans under the recently announced stimulus package,an official statement on Friday quoted him as saying. “The changes made in the definition of the MSME sector will also help them,” he said. HT had reported on Tuesday that export units, trading firms and hospitality ventures could also tap the Rs 3 lakh crore credit facility offered to MSMEs under the recent economic stimulus package even if they are not registered as MSMEs, but meet the eligibility criteria.On hardships being faced by retail traders even after the relaxations of the lockdown restrictions, the minister said that a majority of shops had been allowed to open, without any distinction between essential and non-essential goods and services. “The decision to open the remaining shops in the malls will be taken soon, after taking into account the guidelines of the health ministry,” the statement quoted him as saying at a meeting with the representatives of traders associations via video conferencing on Thursday night.The minister said several indicators show that an economic recovery lies ahead. “The power consumption this month is almost at par with the corresponding period last year,” he said. Exports, which declined in April by almost 60%, have started showing an uptick, and preliminary figures indicate the decline this month will be smaller, he said.Services exports rose even the last month. The decline in imports outpaced the fall in merchandise exports, lowering the trade deficit.Goyal said that during the lockdown period, the nation had geared itself up to fight the Covid-19 pandemic and built capacities. “Domestic manufacturing of the protection equipment (like masks, sanitizers, gloves) got a boost, health infrastructure was scaled up, and awareness was generated among the people,” the statement quoted the minister as saying.“Timely and correct decisions taken by the Prime Minister, and adhered to by the people, have helped the country, as we are in a better position compared to many other nations of the world, with more resources and lesser population,” he said.Goyal told traders not to feel threatened by e-commerce, saying consumers had realised the importance of neighbourhood stores in an hour of crisis.He said the government was working to facilitate a B-2-B (business to business) model for retail traders so that they can expand their reach.Goyal urged traders to use, promote and support Indian goods.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/atmanirbhar-plan-covers-credit-for-traders-goyal/story-vZOlzaamZIsh10Oazqc00M.html

30-05-2020||India||Trump offers to mediate as India, China eye reset||US President Donald Trump on Wednesday waded into the tense border standoff between India and China, saying he was “ready, willing and able to mediate” between the two Asian neighbours, a statement that could irk Beijing more than New Delhi.Shortly before Trump made his offer through a tweet, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said at a press conference in Beijing that the situation on the China-India border was “generally stable and controllable.” The sides were communicating through both their front-line military units and their respective embassies to “properly resolve relevant issues through dialogue and consultation,” Zhao said.China is committed to abiding by agreements signed by the sides and to “maintaining peace and stability in the border area between China and India”, he said.Also read| India China standoff explained: Bridge over troubled watersChina’s ambassador to India, Sun Weidong, made a pitch for putting ties back on an even keel. Without referring to the border standoff, Sun told a webinar that the two sides “pose no threat to each other” and should “never let the differences shadow the overall… bilateral cooperation”. At the same time, he added, they should seek “understanding through communication and constantly resolve differences”. Also Watch | China’s muscle flexing explained and how India can tame the dragon l In FocusThere was no official reaction to both developments from Indian officials, but people familiar with developments acknowledged that the two sides were in contact through diplomatic channels in both New Delhi and Beijing to address the situation.The Indian side has already made it clear that it won’t allow any unilateral alteration of the status quo along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) even as it works towards a peaceful resolution of the worst stand-off since the 73-day face-off between border troops at Doklam in 2017.Trump, who has in the past repeatedly offered to mediate between India and Pakistan on the issue of Kashmir and been rebuffed by New Delhi, said he had informed India and China of his offer. However, this couldn’t be independently confirmed.Also read: Donald Trump offers to mediate ‘raging’ India-China border dispute“We have informed both India and China that the United States is ready, willing and able to mediate or arbitrate their now raging border dispute. Thank you!” he tweeted.The US has been closely tracking the latest flare-up on the India-China border, and Trump’s remarks came a week after his administration’s outgoing pointperson for South Asia, Alice Wells, strongly backed the Indian position in the standoff and said such disputes are a “reminder of the threat posed by China”.The flare-ups were a “reminder that Chinese aggression is not always just rhetorical”, Wells told reporters on May 20. “And so whether it’s in the South China Sea or whether it’s along the border with India, we continue to see provocations and disturbing behaviour by China that raises questions about how China seeks to use its growing power,” she had said.Chinese envoy Sun Weidong, while fielding questions during the webinar organised by the Confederation of Young Leaders (CYL), underscored the importance of developing bilateral relations and deepening understanding of the “important consensus reached” by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping.Without any reference whatsoever to the standoff, Sun said: “We should adhere to the basic judgment that China and India are each other’s opportunities and pose no threat to each other. We need to see each other’s development in a correct way and enhance strategic mutual trust.“We should correctly view our differences and never let the differences shadow the overall situation of bilateral cooperation. At the same time, we should gradually seek understanding through communication and constantly resolve differences.”The “‘Dragon and Elephant dancing together’ is the only right choice for China and India” as it serves the fundamental interests of both countries, which should also strengthen cooperation in investment, production and other fields, Sun said.Sun referred to the responses of both countries to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic and said China “will continue to provide assistance to India within our capacity” to fight the pandemic. He also said the two sides will try to celebrate the 70th anniversary of diplomatic relations in various ways despite the pandemic.Meanwhile, the Indian Army’s top brass discussed security issues, including the border row with China in eastern Ladakh, where thousands of Indian and Chinese soldiers are locked in a standoff at multiple points, officials said.Soldiers from both sides are eyeball-to-eyeball at four locations along the LAC and several rounds of talks between local military commanders have failed to break the deadlock.The situation in eastern Ladakh was discussed in detail at the three-day army commanders’ conference that began on Wednesday. “The apex level leadership of Indian Army will brainstorm on current emerging security and administrative challenges and chart the future course for the army,” an army spokesperson said on Tuesday.Trump’s offer to mediate came against the backdrop of steadily rising hostility and antipathy towards China in the US over the Covid-19 outbreak, which followed months of differences over trade and mounting irritation over alleged theft of intellectual property.People closely involved with India-US discussions said Trump’s tweet conformed to continuing hardening of his antipathy for China, driven by powerful hawks in his administration.“It’s a move to poke the Chinese, surely, much like a class teacher calling two squabbling students,” said a person familiar with these matters on condition of anonymity. “China believes it belongs to a more senior class, the argument goes, and will not take kindly to being monitored with India by a higher authority.”India is likely to reject Trump’s offer, as it has rejected all third-party mediation in any of its international disputes as a matter of policy, which has bipartisan endorsement from all political parties.Trump and his Republican allies have attacked China relentlessly over the Covid-19 outbreak in a bid to hold it responsible for its spread in the US. Trump has also called for an independent investigation into the origin of the outbreak and American officials have suggested the virus might have leaked from a virology lab in Wuhan.About two-thirds of Americans — 66% — have an unfavourable view of China, according to a study conducted by Pew Research Center in March. “This is the most negative rating for the country since the Center began asking the question in 2005 and is up nearly 20 percentage points since the start of the Trump administration (January 2017),” the research body said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trump-offers-to-mediate-as-india-china-eye-reset/story-6eB13dM5PB72PVgrmG7sJK.html
30-05-2020||India||Covid-19 outbreak in Chennai’s Koyambedu market leads to surge in cases in Andhra’s Chittoor||As Tamil Nadu crossed 10,000 cases on May 15 — the first case, a 45-year-old man with a travel history to Oman, was detected in early March — a wholesale market of fresh fruit, vegetables and flowers in Chennai has become the latest warzone for the administration battling the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. According to a state government official who did not wish to be named, around 4000 people linked to the market have already been tested out of which 1000 are primary contacts. At least 2500 positive cases currently pertain to the Koyambedu cluster, which is higher than the total number of cases, close to 1350, linked to the Tablighi Jamaat religious conference held in New Delhi in mid-March, and which drove up Tamil Nadu’s numbers in April.The Koyambedu hotspot is also responsible for cases in 10 districts other than Chennai including Ariyalur, Chengalpattu, Kanchipuram, Cuddalore, Perambalur, Madurai and Tiruvallur. “We have either carried out facility quarantine or home quarantine of those who started the journey from Koyambedu,” the official quoted above, said.Spread over 54 acres, Koyambedu market complex is one of the largest wholesale market complexes for perishable goods in India. It houses more than 1000 wholesalers and over 2000 retail shops. In non-pandemic times, Koyambedu receives nearly 1500 truckloads of horticultural produce and at least 100,000 visitors, daily. Usually bustling with customers, vendors and trucks ferrying goods from other parts of the state, the market complex often witnesses a rush before festival days. However, by the time that the Tamil New Year was celebrated on April 14, the second lockdown had been announced, and as the work had dwindled — barely 400 trucks now visited the market daily — several labourers returned to their home districts. By then, however, the virus had spread among workers. Now, it began to leave Chennai.On May 4, 300 of the 527 new cases reported were found to be linked to the market. Within hours, it was shut down. According to S Ram Mohan, a core committee member of the Joint Action Committee of vegetable vendors’ associations at Koyambedu market, the district administration had shut down the flower and fruit sales at the market complex well before May 4. By then, even the vegetable retailers had stopped operations from the complex. On April 28, retail traders and fruit sellers from Koyambedu had been relocated to the bus terminus at Madhavaram, a suburb in the city’s northwest. Expecting wholesalers to do likewise would have been difficult as few open spaces in the city have the capacity to handle 3000 tonnes of vegetables each day, GD Rajasekaran, president, Koyambedu Periyar Market Association, said. Mohan added that in the last week of April, administration officials also issued e-passes to wholesalers, their staff and truck labourers who were still entering the market for work. “We were already operating at 50% capacity, but even that amounted to at least 40,000 persons,” he said. However, the district issued far fewer passes, he claimed. When the announcement was made to shut down the market, Mohan said, there was at least Rs 10 crore worth of vegetables making their way to Koyambedu, and Rs 3 crore vegetables waiting to be sold inside the complex. The committee managed to extend the time of the shut down to the following morning. By 9 am on May 5, “almost 85% of the vegetables were sold, in a distress sale,” he added.Panic buyingOn April 24, the state government announced a hard lockdown for four days, between April 26 and 29. This led to a spate in panic buying. Mohan recounted scenes of utter chaos in Koyambedu in the two days before the hard lockdown was enforced. On April 30, another round of panic buying ensued after people realized that the second leg of the national lockdown, which was expected to end on May 3, would likely be extended. By this time, however, the first case of Covid-19 had been detected from the market complex. “We had rushed to the market hours after the announcement [of the hard lockdown] thinking we would stock up for our own homes and for sales, as all stores would be shut for three days. But there was already a crazy rush at the market even though it was late. I could see people jostling. My partner later said the crowd was at least four times the normal amount,” a wholesale trader who refused to be named, said.Last week, chief minister Edappadi Panaiswami blamed the traders for not vacating the market when asked in March itself. He said that despite several pleas since March they were adamant on staying put citing losses that would be incurred by them. “Now, because many from Koyambedu had travelled to other districts, the number of infected there has gone up. This is the reason for the spike in cases in Chennai also,” he said. However, Mohan countered this and said that no official meeting was held between the wholesale vendors and the authorities in March or April. “We had decided to declare a holiday on March 27 and 28, after the lockdown was announced and everyone was prepared for it. On March 26, we were called by the officials who were furious that we had announced the holiday. The president of our association informed us after the meeting that we had been instructed by the government to continue to remain open. The concern was that there should be no stoppage of essential commodities,” he said. The state has now relocated the Koyambedu market complex to Thirumazhisai, 20 km away, in a large vacant plot in a satellite township located between Poonamallee and Sriperumbudur on the Bangalore highway. At 198 licensed wholesale shops have been opened, and the market now opens at 9pm every night. By 6 am, the sales of the day are completed. Watch towers, with policemen, overlook the shops; ever so often, a patrol car would pass by. On Thursday, the district collector of Thiruvallur district held a meeting with the shop owners, stressing on them the need to wear masks, use sanitisers and practice physical distancing, Mohan said. Pushing up the numbersSuper-spreading events have played a much bigger role in the virus spread in Tamil Nadu than in Maharashtra and Gujarat — two other states that have seen huge numbers of Covid-19 cases, experts said.The spike in numbers due to the Koyambedu cluster is immediately noticeable. Between April 24 and May 3, the average daily new cases reported in Tamil Nadu were 134; from May 4 to May 13, the average grew to 620 a day.Persons linked to the market have spread the virus the neighbouring states of Kerala and Andhra Pradesh. At least 70 personnel linked to the Manathavady police station in Kerala’s Wayanad have gone into quarantine as a precautionary measure after three of their colleagues tested positive. The trio is believed to have contracted the virus from a man who was called to the station in connection with a case on April 28 and May 2; he later tested positive for Covid-19. This man is suspected to be a contact of a truck driver, who returned from Koyambedu market, and who has already infected at least 10 persons, including his wife, mother and grandchild. In Andhra Pradesh, eight cases are believed to be linked to the Koyambedu market.T Jacob John, a former professor of Virology, Christian Medical College (CMC), Vellore blamed ad-hoc decisions and panic among people because of the total lockdown. “A lack of imagination and understanding of ground realities had allowed opportunities for the virus to spread rapidly,” he said, adding that to contain the disease, all people must wear masks outside their home and maintain hand hygiene. “It is a simple solution that should be strictly enforced. It should have done long ago,” he said.As the state prepares to come out of the lockdown in a phased manner starting May 17, it must also direct its resources towards cases that will arise from the Shramik Special trains, ferrying migrant workers as well as the return of residents from other countries via flights. Since Friday, the daily bulletin issued by the state government has begun to keep track of the Covid-19 positive cases of passengers returning from other countries and states: six from Maldives, 40 from Maharashtra, among others. In such a scenario, the day-by-day rise of cases linked to the market will add to the pressure on the state’s health infrastructure. The good news is that the state is testing much more than it was even last month. Some other experts pointed out that Tamil Nadu’s high case load was paired with a high testing rate. The state had conducted the highest total number of tests as per the HT dashboard at 280,023 as of Thursday night, which translates into 4179 tests per million people, far higher than the national average of 1540 per million people.“The more you test, the more you find. Tamil Nadu is finding more cases because they are testing more. The state has a strong public health infrastructure,” said Dr V Ramana Dhara, professor at Indian Institute of Public Health-Hyderabad. “These cases are probably occurring in other states too, but they are not testing more. When testing increases, numbers will also increase,” he added.On Thursday, a group of public health experts met the chief minister and urged him to step up testing and said there was no need to panic with the high numbers. Speaking to reporters, Prabhdeep Kaur of the National Institute of Epidemiology scientists pointed out that Tamil Nadu’s testing rate was better than many countries and that increased testing was the bedrock to create successful containment strategies.“The increase in number of cases is something to be expected especially as the most stringent components of the lockdown are relaxed. We are seeing the residual of a couple of major clusters, for instance, the Koyambedu cluster,” Dr Ram Gopalakrishnan, an infectious disease specialist at Apollo Hospital who is a committee of healthcare and medical experts that consults with the government told HT. “The incubation period of this disease is between 2 to 14 days, so whatever happened 2-14 days ago, we are seeing it now. And obviously there was some relaxation in lockdown between the second and third lockdowns, we are seeing the effects of that too now.”With inputs from Sowmiya Ashok||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-outbreak-in-chennai-s-koyambedu-market-leads-to-surge-in-cases-in-andhra-s-chittoor/story-QtcM97qFIJ6o4yM44ewh7K.html
30-05-2020||Editorials||Covid-19: Decoding the Delhi spike | HT Editorial||On Thursday, Delhi recorded 1,024 cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). It conducted 7,615 tests. And it had a positivity rate of 13.4%. The capital now has the third highest number of cases in the country, after Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu. There are three separate issues here. The first is the increase in cases. This is not a reason to get alarmed. It, in fact, reflects the fact that Delhi is testing more people — at 9,689 tests per million, it has the best testing rate among the worst-hit states. As is now globally recognised, testing widely is the only way to track the infected, isolate them, treat those who are severely affected, and ensure that they don’t transmit the infection to others. With more relaxations in both mobility and economic activity, cases will inevitably rise more. The second issue is the positivity rate. In the week ending on Thursday, Delhi’s positivity rate was 12.2%. This is a matter of concern, for it shows that, among the people who are being tested, more are turning out to be positive in the Capital than in most other states. This, then, indicates a more comprehensive spread of the disease in the Capital than has been estimated so far. The third element is deaths. While there has been a debate on the official numbers, Delhi’s death rate remains lower than the national fatality rate. This, in turn, means that most patients have symptoms which dissipate with care and treatment. All of this then has to be the basis for the four-pronged policy response. One, to get an accurate sense of the spread of the disease, Delhi will need to ramp up its testing even more. Only this will help keep those infected away from those who are not as movement increases even further. Two, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has claimed that Delhi has adequate health infrastructure to deal with a surge. But if the city has to prevent what is happening in Mumbai, it is key to increase the number of beds available and pull in more private facilities for the purpose. Three, the Delhi government has rightly focused on home isolation. For a majority of patients, this is the best way out — but it requires patients to be responsible and constantly monitor their health. And finally, it will help if the government is more transparent with data — and provide a district-wise break up within the capital of cases, deaths, and other relevant parameters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/covid-19-decoding-the-delhi-spike/story-jRFnSmNS1UdLzmYtUtw6aO.html
