23-05-2020||News||Support and empower India’s migrant workers||Heartbreaking images of the gruelling trek back home of distressed migrant labourers and the tragic loss of lives in road accidents have shaken India’s conscience. The operation Shramik Express, which is ensuring the safe return of over four million migrants by buses and trains, shows that the government has mounted a whatever-it-takes response.Migrant labourers are the backbone of India’s informal sector and micro, small and medium enterprises. Their crisscrossing of states for jobs signifies economic integration, and also inter-regional and rural-urban disparities. While empowering themselves, they also enrich their home and host states. The national lockdown has threatened to unravel this fabric. Their exodus from host states has created a humanitarian and health security challenge, and a logistical nightmare. It has complicated Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi’s mission to contain the coronavirus contagion. It has posed a long-term labour dislocation and atrophy risk. It is already impacting the restart of economic activities and recovery plans activated by the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan (Self-reliant India Mission).  The Opposition is using the situation to critique the government’s strategy for handling the coronavirus disease. As concerned stakeholders, they must recognise that an all-of-India effort is required. The PM is driving India’s Raja Bhagirath-like efforts to respond to the cataclysm in the spirit of cooperative and consultative federalism, with empathy for the poor, including “pravasi shramiks”. The infectious virus has pushed governments into untrodden policy and action space. Any life-saving action in prevention and response extracts Bhagirath’s penance. States decide on extension and enforcement of lockdown, and are responsible for providing relief. The Centre had to persuade the states to agree to the mass transportation of workers with the attendant risks of contagion. Some chief ministers such as Yogi Adityanath have been proactive, while others are hesitant and unprepared. In the future, Centre-state protocols must be established for instant implementation in disasters. It is important to collect comprehensive migrant worker-related data and statistics that are skill-, sector-, and gender-disaggregated, pan-India and state-wise. Its absence has blindsided all on the scale of the migrant labour challenge and frustrated efforts to reach them to help with food, cash health services, shelter or relocation to home/host state.The information asymmetry poor migrants faced to access information on relief, benefits and transport needs to be addressed. Many became prey to disinformation, unscrupulous touts and motivated panic-mongers. Well-functioning hotlines, outreach systems and providing low-cost smart phones and IT education are crucial.Many migrant workers left cities for fear of disease and stigma, job, shelter, income, food insecurity, and to be with families. Others stayed in cities due to pull factors: Better wages, jobs, economic and social upward mobility prospects.The challenges they face on return to their home states include resistance from their communities fearing infection and lack of income and employment. Governments must provide for their local sustenance and employment and return to host states. Targeted and ecosystem support for migrant workers is a major thrust of the Atmanirbhar Bharat package. A veritable Abhiyaan for migrant workers’ welfare and empowerment must be driven with state governments on a war-footing. At this time, migrant workers’ well-being and unleashing their potential is vital to India’s survival and economic revival.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/support-and-empower-india-s-migrant-workers/story-m5Jy0HzFPM6uJKyx06rqrN.html
23-05-2020||Mumbai||A year on, kin remember Dr Tadvi, say she wouldn’t be scared of virus||Since the lockdown, BYL Nair Hospital has been converted into a Covid hospital where more than 800 patients are receiving treatment. Recently, the hospital’s gynaecology department celebrated the record of delivering 100 babies by Covid-positive mothers. Had Dr Payal Tadvi not died by suicide a year ago, she would have been there, working alongside her fellow doctors in the gynaecology department, said her mother Abeda Salim Tadvi. “She always wanted to help people. She would have never gotten scared of the virus,” said Abeda. On May 22, 2019, the body of Dr Tadvi, a second-year resident doctor, was found at the medical college attached to Nair Hospital after she died by suicide. She was 26. Three of her senior colleagues — Dr Hema Ahuja, Dr Ankita Khandelwal and Dr Bhakti Mehare — were charged with caste-based harassment and abetting her suicide. They have since been released on bail and the case is pending trial in court. Students at the medical college said relations between seniors and juniors has improved and the college has become more prompt in acting against harassment and other disturbances since Dr Tadvi’s suicide.For Dr Tadvi’s family, the grief remains overwhelming and they’re still awaiting justice. “I still go through her messages and books. I wish I had a time machine to bring her back. She was the apple of my eye,” said her mother Abeda. While the court case makes its way through the judicial system, Abeda, 51, said that she is yet to receive the compensation of Rs 10 lakh that she claims the then state government had promised her following a close-door meeting. HT has copies of the letters sent by Dr Tadvi’s family, seeking the help they were promised.“If they don’t want to give money, the government can at least give my son a job. Due to his physical disability, he couldn’t study beyond Class 10. But he can do a clerical job to support himself after our death,” said Abeda, who is a cancer survivor and lives with her husband and disabled son. Minister for minority development Nawab Malik said the matter would be looked into but it could not take precedence over the Covid-19 outbreak. “If the former government had promised it, they should have released the money. I haven’t received any letter from the family. But they can write to us or the [municipal] corporation. The matter can only be heard after Covid, which is a priority now,” he said.Dr Salman Tadvi, who is an anaesthetist, remembers how important medicine was for his wife, who was the first person from her Tadvi Bhil village to pursue medical sciences. “To her, her career was everything. Considering, I am an anaesthetist and she was studying gynaecology, we were a perfect couple,” said Dr Salman.The two were married in 2016 and spent their first year as a couple apart because Dr Tadvi served her one-year compulsory bond in a rural district while Dr Salman completed his postgraduate degree in anaesthesia from King Edward Memorial College in Mumbai. In 2017, the couple shifted to Dr Salman’s hometown Aurangabad for a year before coming to Mumbai in 2018, when Dr Payal was admitted to Nair Hospital for her postgraduate degree and Dr Salman secured a government job in the city.Now, Dr Salman works at Jogeshwari Trauma Centre where he is currently on Covid duty. He has moved out of the flat that the couple had rented near Nair Hospital and shifted to Jogeshwari. “The room reminded me of her, so I had to leave it,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/a-year-on-kin-remember-dr-tadvi-say-she-wouldn-t-be-scared-of-virus/story-GvoFmFhnFiU7rzxqjowruM.html

However, the Tamil Nadu government allegedly denied permission at the last minute saying they do not have provisions to accommodate so many people returning to the state.“Our state government had provided 50 buses to carry people to CSMT station. Of which, two buses had already left. We had received permission from the local police station and the railway minister had provided for a train. But, Tamil Nadu government denied permission to us at the last minute, which is why we protested against the government,” said S Vivekanandaraja, a social activist.Vivekanandaraja said that they have approached the local authorities requesting them to look into the matter. They have said the migrants will be informed in the next two days about what provisions will be made for them to return home.“We had left with most of our belongings. If other states are ready to accept people back home, why not Tamil Nadu. Disappointed that these people had to return home,” said Ramesh Nadar, a resident of Dharavi.However, when senior police officers were contacted, they denied information of any protest. Dharavi is one of the red zones in the state, with around 1,478 Covid-19 positive cases until Friday evening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/train-cancelled-at-last-minute-1-6k-from-tamil-nadu-stranded/story-QEUzao0syM37CExj3sbr2N.html
23-05-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra government again seeks Centre’s nod to resume local train services||The Maharashtra government has once again decided to request the Centre to allow the resumption of local train services for the workforce engaged in emergency and essential services. It has decided to request the Centre for more trains to ferry the remaining migrants who want to go back to their respective home states.The call was taken following a high-level meeting between chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, his senior cabinet colleagues, and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar on Saturday.Pawar, who held three meetings with the CM and his cabinet colleagues in the last nine days, discussed various other issues related to the ongoing lockdown and the exit strategy.

We need around 200 more trains to send the migrants back to their states. The government wants to send them back before the ongoing lockdown ends on May 31,” said an official from Mantralaya.Pawar reportedly was in favour of resumption of road transport within the state and alongside restarting train and air services.According to officials present at the meeting, a range of other issues, including handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, augmentation of the health services, revival of various sectors, strategy to attract migrant labourers back, and helping the education sector were discussed in the meeting.

Around 4pm, the suspect had shared the false information on his social media account that after coronavirus cases at Zee Media group (of which 32 employees have tested positive so far), 19 persons from our channel had tested positive as well. He even urged the people to maintain distance from all our employees,” said Rahul Khanna, who is part of the news channel, in a complaint to the police.He alleged that the suspect shared the false information knowing that it could create panic in many.“This was a targeted act against us, meant to harass us mentally. The act which violates the epidemic act was a ploy to defame us. The situation in the country is already tense, and this kind of false news can cause a lot of harm. From the suspects’ posts it is clear that the idea behind it was to destroy the goodwill of the channel,” said Khanna in his complaint.After the post circulated on social media, employees of the news channel started getting calls fro their friends and relatives. The incident was reported to the police on May 21.Taking cognisance of the matter, a case was registered against the suspect, identified as Rajesh Sharma, at the Phase 2 police station under sections 505 (2) of the Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of the IT Act and epidemic act. He was arrested from his home in Agra. The police said the suspect works as a radar operator for the Indian Army.“Whether the social media post was generated by him or he only shared it is still being investigated. However, commenting, sharing or forwarding any fake content is liable to legal action under the IT Act,” said deputy commissioner of police( zone 2), Harish Chandra.Police officers said the suspect reportedly told them that he only shared something that he had received from another source.The suspect was produced before a magistrate and later sent to jail, the police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/army-man-arrested-for-sharing-fake-information-on-covid-19-cases-related-to-private-news-channel/story-AybadprkxgwQ5dcYnYLw8M.html

Ayub Tamboli, currently posted at the urban development department, will take additional charge as Palghar tehsildar till further notice. Shinde was seen in a video allegedly kicking and abusing a migrant at Aryan Grounds in Palghar when he asked the tehsildar for a token to board a train to UP. On Wednesday, around 5,200 migrants had assembled at the Aryan Grounds for collecting tokens to board three trains to north India from Palghar station. The migrants were waiting to receive the tokens when Shinde allegedly assaulted a migrant. A video of the incident went viral on social media after which revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat ordered an inquiry into the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/migrant-assault-palghar-tehsildar-sent-on-leave/story-oWfrq51sLL5uYVvRJ62NbL.html
23-05-2020||City||Tricity buzz: HT Chandigarh reporters’ tracker on all those making, or faking, news amid coronavirus lockdown||CORONA BREAK FOR HEALTH DEPARTMENT IN MOHALIThe Mohali health department is finally breathing easy. Employees are relieved that the march of the coronavirus has halted, at least for now. Till a fortnight ago, the district health officials were on their toes, collecting samples, sealing localities and shifting patients. Now that Mohali has been declared Covid-free, they are finally catching up on a much-needed break.SANJAY BANIWAL FOR PRESIDENT!Chandigarh director general of police (DGP) Sanjay Baniwal held a meeting with members of the Muslim community on Friday, requesting them to keep mosques closed on Eid in view of the social distancing norms amid the Covid-19 pandemic. As a goodwill gesture, Chandigarh Police brought along seven quintals of seviyaan (vermicelli) for the community. When Baniwal was leaving, members of the community presented a bouquet of flowers and blessed him, saying that they hoped he goes on to become the President of India one day. The DGP was all smiles and thanked them profusely for the hospitality and cooperation.SKETCH IN ORDER OF HIERARCHYA sketch glorifying the efforts of Chandigarh administrator VP Singh Badnore and prominent officers of the Union Territory administration besides doctors from Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) in fighting Covid-19 was widely shared on social media recently. But a closer look at the sketch revealed the hierarchy in the system. With Badnore at the top, UT adviser Manoj Parida and UT health director Dr G Dewan at level 2 followed by PGIMER director Dr Jagat Ram, police, district administration and municipal corporation officers. This left PGIMER doctors miffed and they took to Twitter to support their director for the top order. SIFARISH FOR A TICKET TO BIHAR, UPAs the Mohali district administration started sending migrant workers to their native places in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, it led to flood of phone calls, seeking “sifarish (favour)”. With limited seats allotted to each sub division and a large number of migrants wanting to return, the migrants resorted to pulling strings to ensure a seat. Not just local leaders and officers but they even contacted journalists to put in a word so that they would be allowed to sit in a bus that drops them at the Mohali railway station. Though the police allowed everyone on first-come-first-basis, the mindset is difficult to change for people kept calling for favours. WHEN CTU BUSES RAN EMPTYChandigarh Transport Undertaking (CTU) officials were a harried lot when a senior UT officer admonished them for not starting the bus service even after the administration had declared its resumption in a press release a day earlier. “What could we do? Though we were not ready, we pressed some buses into service late in the afternoon. Most buses went empty as people didn’t know that the service had resumed for a few hours. At least a senior UT officer could tell the media that the administration has made bus services operational,” said an official.PANCHKULA COPS TAKE GoT ROUTE TO DRIVE HOME POINTPanchkula police are at their creative best with Covid-19 prevention slogans on their Facebook page these days. A recent post shows Hollywood actor Kit Harington, who played Jon Snow in The Game of Thrones, wearing a mask! The caption says, “Even Jon Snow knows that the mask is important! Don’t leave the house without a mask. #YouKnowEverythingJonSnow.” Another interesting post read: “Lockdown khatam hone ka intezar sirf aap nahi, corona bhi kar raha hai (Not only you but coronavirus is also waiting for the lockdown to end).”UT EDUCATION DEPARTMENT CAUGHT IN THE CROSSFIRENo one knows where the loyalties of the UT education department lie. This week, in the battle between parents and school authorities over the collection of fee, everyone blamed the department. School authorities said that the education department does not have the right to instruct them to collect only tuition fee, while parents blamed it for allowing schools to collect fee amid the lockdown.(Inputs by Hillary Victor, Shailee Dogra, Munieshwer A Sagar, Rajanbir Singh, Amanjeet Singh, Yuvraj Kaushal and Srishti Jaswal)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/tricity-buzz-ht-chandigarh-reporters-tracker-on-all-those-making-or-faking-news-amid-coronavirus-lockdown/story-sMxxN6aepOFCxp0B4hsDTJ.html

23-05-2020||Delhi||Fire at Covid hospital in Hauz Khas, eight patients rescued||Eight Covid-19 patients were rescued by firefighters after a fire broke out at a private hospital designated for treatment of Covid-19 patients in south Delhi’s Hauz Khas on Saturday evening. All patients are safe and were handed over to the hospital staff for further care, senior fire department officials said. This is the first time the Delhi Fire Service (DFS) team had to pull off a rescue operation of people infected with the highly contagious Sars-Cov-2 virus. The rescued included five men and three women.Atul Garg, director, DFS, said the rescue operation was a big challenge but was carried out efficiently with none of the patients sustaining any burn injury.“We received a call around 5.45pm reporting that Cygnus Orthocare hospital opposite IIT-Delhi campus has caught fire. Five fire tenders were rushed to the hospital to contain the fire and later three more units had to be sent,” Garg said.“Our firefighters who reached the spot found that it was a three-storey building with a basement. We found that fire started in an operation theatre on the third floor. Ensuring proper precautions, wearing gumboots, gloves, goggles, helmet and fire suits, our men entered the hospital in two teams, with three men in each team,” Garg said.He said because the building was full of smoke, their men were wearing breathing apparatuses to be able to locate those trapped inside.“After successfully locating each of the patients, because none of them were injured due to the fire, our firefighters guided them out of the building,” Garg said.The team that was involved in the rescue operation said that it was only upon reaching the hospital that they got to know that there were Covid-19 patients admitted there. Sumesh Kumar Dua, divisional officer, who led the rescue operation, said the only focus of his team was to evacuate the occupants of the building safely.“We have dealt with all kinds of rescue operations, but this was a first of its kind. It was natural for us to be a bit scared. We, too, are human but all that we had in mind was to safely get everyone out of the building and to douse the flames,” Dua said.He said the firefighters were attired in their helmets, gumboots and overalls, apart from masks and gloves. The team was directed to follow all Covid-19 safety protocol such as avoiding contact with the patients' faces to prevent any infection possibility.“The fire was doused in less than an hour and afterwards, the entire team was thoroughly sanitised, and so were the tenders and equipment used in the operation,” Dua said.He said the patients were handed over to the hospital staff for further care.Cygnus Orthocare Hospital said that there was no major damage was reported in the fire.“…The fire was first reported on the third floor of the hospital, which houses the operation theatres. The Delhi Fire Services along with the hospital’s fire division have controlled the fire and are still on the job. There has been no loss or damage to life,” said Dr Amit Vig, unit head, Ujala Cygnus Orthocare Hospital.Without specifying details of where the eight coronavirus positive patients were moved to, Dr Vig said all of them were moved to “safe areas”.“We are well trained to manage situations like these and our team responded immediately. Everyone (the patients) was moved to safe areas promptly in an organized fashion,” he added.Fire chief, Garg, said it was the first such operation where they had to rescue coronavirus patients. “Our firefighters did a splendid job. All of them underwent deep cleaning which has been mandated after every rescue operation,” he said.He also said that the probable cause of the fire was a short-circuit in an air-conditioner in the operation theatre.However, he said the exact cause will be confirmed following a detailed inspection. Garg appealed to people to get air-conditioners serviced by authorised professionals as short-circuits in ACs is one of the most common causes of fire in summer months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/fire-at-covid-hospital-in-hauz-khas-eight-patients-rescued/story-SDlMGwKDVzvigKxI8ZaJEN.html
23-05-2020||City||Law varsity under Punjab government scanner after CAG finds irregularities in its functioning||The Punjab government has put the Rajiv Gandhi National University of Law (RGNUL), Patiala, under scanner after the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) listed serious financial and administrative irregularities in its functioning.CAG, in its report highlighted recently through an RTI, has noted that tenders worth crores of rupees were awarded to ineligible contractors by the university, the construction of the campus building was started without even approval of its plan and irregular appointments were made.Now, the Punjab higher education department has initiated a probe into the financial matters of RGNUL and has asked the university to supply year-wise financial reports, details of its fixed deposits (FDs), recruitment process and travel expenses of university officials. “The Punjab government has funded the university to the tune of Rs 220 crore, and it has every right to ask how the money was spent … whether the rules were followed or not. CAG has left out several areas which need proper investigation. The university took grants from the state government, but didn’t supply a single audit report to the education department,” said a higher education department official.He said that while other universities are starving for funds, RGNUL spends lavishly. “For only 1,000 students, they were taking Rs 15 crore from the Punjab government, while other universities get between Rs 35 crore and Rs 70 crore each for catering to students ranging between 2.5 lakh to 4 lakh. There must be some accountability,” said the official.“While the Punjabi University has slipped into a debt of Rs 130 crore in the past one decade, RGNUL made fixed deposits of Rs 48 crore. Why they concealed these facts from the Punjab government?” he asked.Higher education minister Tript Rajinder Bajwa said the Punjab government has the right to know how taxpayers’ money is utilised by the university. “We have sought explanation from the university on various issues. Further action will be taken after we receive its reply,” he said.CAG FINDINGSRegarding construction of a Rs 10-crore auditorium, CAG highlighted that the work was awarded to an ineligible contractor, who caused a massive delay in the project.“The contractor was eligible for works up to Rs 5 crore whereas he was allotted a work of R. 9.99 crore.”Besides, the auditor questioned the authorities over making the registrar’s residence as VIP guest house, causing unfruitful expenditure of Rs 1.5 crore.The CAG also noted that the university building was started without even getting its plan approved from Punjab Urban Development Authority (PUDA), and later when the state government started penal proceedings, the university requested for remission of fine.Besides, CCTV cameras worth Rs 17 lakh were purchased by the university authorities without inviting tenders.Also, the university denied the benefit of a welfare scheme to the scheduled caste (SC) students.RUMOURS ABOUT V-C’S RESIGNATIONMeanwhile, rumours are doing the rounds that RGNUL vice-chancellor Dr Paramjit S Jaswal has tendered his resignation amid speculation that he was perturbed over the explanation sought by the higher education department over the university’s financial matters.However, Jaswal was not available for his comments despite repeated calls made by HT. The office of the chief justice, Punjab and Haryana high court, who is chancellor of the university, also did not respond to a query seeking confirmation about the V-C’s resignation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/law-varsity-under-punjab-government-scanner-after-cag-finds-irregularities-in-its-functioning/story-Rp7qZnc6h0zP5cKxLgso2J.html

She had gone out for a walk with her best friend, her dog Champagne, after spending days in isolation at hospital and home. It felt blissful till she had to cut short the walk when she realised every passerby in her society was staring at her, as if they knew she was the first Covid-19 patient of Gurugram and Haryana.“Though I was wearing a mask, I felt people were scared of me,” says the 26-year-old, who requested anonymity. “It affected me when the media reported that I had run away from the Civil Hospital. I had only been shifted to a private hospital after consultation with doctors. My contact details were leaked on WhatsApp groups. My parents and I got calls from unknown numbers. A man even posed as a policeman and entered our house. Nothing can be more traumatising,” she says, recalling the days after she tested positive. A resident of Sector 9, the woman, Gurugram’s patient zero, works as a marketing professional with an IT company in the city. She says, “People lack empathy. Rather than being concerned about what I was going through after contracting a disease, neighbours were more concerned about their own well-being.” The news and social media made her anxious. “After suffering an anxiety attack, I decided to disconnect from everyone. I focused only on my office work while I was admitted in the isolation ward,” she says. She was so scared that she quarantined herself for a month at home after being discharged. “It was a conscious decision as my three-month-old nephew stays with us.” While in isolation, she relied on her mother who kept her strong mentally and physically. Today, she is back pursuing her hobbies of cooking, playing with her nephew and taking her dog out for a walk. She understands that getting back to normalcy will take time. She is still to figure out how she contracted SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes coronavirus disease) . On February 22, she had gone for a vacation to Malaysia and Indonesia along with her cousin and returned on March 4. She had fever and cold on March 11 and got herself tested the next day only to be diagnosed positive on March 15. “Now I ask everyone to wear a mask and practise hand hygiene because one never knows how one gets infected,” she says. The last two months have changed her, for the better. “I’m more patient and concerned about others struggling with the virus,” she says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-s-patient-zero-recounts-her-time-spent-in-isolation/story-Tu5kpiO1neftOXKPmlxJeK.html
23-05-2020||City||CITCO employee abduction case: Multani died due to torture in custody, says dismissed Punjab Police cop Pinki||Dismissed Punjab Police inspector Gurmeet Singh Pinki on Saturday appeared before the special investigation team (SIT) and recorded his statement in the case registered against former Punjab director general of police (DGP) Sumedh Singh Saini in connection with disappearance of Balwant Singh Multani, a Chandigarh Industrial and Tourism Corporation (CITCO) employee, in 1991.“Multani had died due to torture in custody and his body was later disposed of. The story of handing over his custody to the Qadian police and his later escaping from there is just a cover-up,” said Pinki who appeared before SIT as a witness.He was with the probe team for more than three hours and reiterated what he had said in an interview to a magazine in December 2015.Multani, a son of an IAS officer who worked as a junior engineer with CITCO, was allegedly picked up by two police officers after a terrorist attack on Saini, then senior superintendent of police (SSP), Chandigarh, in which four policemen in his security were killed. The police later claimed that Multani had escaped from the custody of the Qadian police and his whereabouts since then are not known.However, 29 years later, a case was registered against Saini and six others under Sections 364 (kidnapping or abduction in order to murder), 201 (causing disappearance of evidence), 344 (wrongful confinement), 330 (voluntarily causing hurt to exhort confession) and 120 B (criminal conspiracy) in Mohali on May 6 on the basis of a complaint filed by Multani’s brother Palwinder Singh Multani. Former deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Baldev Singh Saini and former inspector Satvir Singh and four retired cops -- sub-inspectors Har Sahai Sharma, Jagir Singh and Anoop Singh and ASI Kuldip Singh -- were also named in the case. Saini and the four retired cops have got anticipatory bail in the case and joined investigations.Pinki, who had come to the Mataur police station at 10 am and left at about 1.15 pm, answered questions regarding how he met Saini, his closeness to the ex-DGP and how Multani died in custody, officials said.Talking about his association with the ex-DGP, Pinki reportedly said, “I have known Saini since December 1988 and have worked with him in Bathinda, Hoshiarpur and Chandigarh.” The officials said Pinki will be asked to come again before the SIT. The FIR registered against Saini and other policemen was based on the disclosures made by Pinki in Outlook magazine in 2015. The FIR mentions that through the interview, complainant Palwinder Multani came to know about the “details of torture of his brother and his subsequent elimination”. “The matter is under investigation,” said Harmandeep Singh Hans, superintendent of police (investigation), Mohali, refusing to divulge any details.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/citco-employee-abduction-case-multani-died-due-to-torture-in-custody-says-dismissed-punjab-police-cop-pinki/story-FZ03YL0Ylc1GeQtdb62nOJ.html
23-05-2020||City||Pvt schools must provide devices, internet to poor students for online classes: Delhi govt tells HC||New Delhi: If Economically Weaker Section (EWS) category students in private schools are unable to access classes online during the lockdown due to lack of devices or internet, schools should ensure or provide the same for students, the state government has submitted in the Delhi High Court. The submission was made by the Directorate of Education (DOE) on Friday evening in response to a plea filed by Justice For All, an NGO, which contended that several students belonging to the EWS and disadvantaged groups (DG) were unable to access classes online due to the lack of availability of these devices. The NGO contended that the decision of private, unaided schools to conduct online classes would affect over 50,000 students who cannot afford laptops, phones or high-speed internet connections. All private and government schools, universities and educational institutions are shut due to the nationwide lockdown, put in place to curb the spread of the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease and classes are being held online.The state government’s submission came on a notice by a Delhi High Court bench of Justices Manmohan and Sanjeev Narula, to the Centre, the Delhi government, the city’s municipal corporations and a few private unaided schools on May 8 seeking a response on the matter. Earlier this month, Hindustan Times had reported that EWS students enrolled in private schools are struggling to keep up with classes online due to logistical issues and have been unable to take their exams as well.Advocate Shikha Bagga, secretary at Justice For All, said Saturday: “The affidavit filed by the Delhi government in the high court clearly mentions that it is the duty of schools to ensure no child is deprived of education online due to lack of material required for attending online classes. The Union of India is bound to release funds for reimbursement as proscribed under the Right to Education (RTE) Act.”The counter affidavit submitted by the Delhi government mentions that as per Section 12(1)(c) of the Right of Children To Free And Compulsory Education Act, 2009, “it is the obligation of the private unaided schools to provide the aforesaid facilities to EWS/DG category students admitted in their schools.” The department further stated that costs, if any, incurred by the state on account of the said reimbursement to schools, would have to be borne by central government as per Section 7 of the RTE Act.Bagga added, “We are getting complaints daily that some private schools are conducting tests and EWS students are not able to appear for them. Measures have to be taken on this front soon otherwise the entire academic year of these students might get affected.”Malkeet Singh, a contractual driver with no work since the lockdown was put in place, has two children studying in top private schools in west Delhi, under the EWS category. While his younger daughter is managing her studies with the help of her teachers and friends living nearby, his 11-year-old son has been unable to attend any classes, which are being held online.“We do not have a laptop or a smartphone so he has not been able to attend any online classes. I got to know through other parents that his tests are slated to begin Monday. We don’t even have books and don’t know what to do,” he said.His son’s school is among the 15 which were served showcause notices by the education department in the past one week after it was found out that EWS/DG students in these schools were not attending online classes regularly.A senior DOE official, requesting anonymity, said, “The concerned schools were issued showcause notices as per the orders of the court, and the court is being appraised of their replies.”In April as well, the DOE had issued a circular directing all private, unaided, recognised schools providing online learning material and students to ensure that the same facilities were extended to students from EWS/DG/Children With Special Needs category students too.On behalf of some of the schools which received the showcause notice, advocate Kamal Gupta said, “While targeting private schools, the petition doesn’t talk about how 17 lakh government school students would access online classes in the absence of laptops or smartphones.”SK Bhattacharya, president of the Action Committee of Unaided, Recognised, Private Schools, said: “We have not received any such complaints from EWS students. The government said that the centre will reimburse the amount for laptops, smartphones and recurring costs for internet connections. But some private schools are not regularly reimbursed for uniforms and books as well. They should be offered some amount in advance.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pvt-schools-must-provide-devices-internet-to-poor-students-for-online-classes-delhi-govt-tells-hc/story-UecJWatLY4ZlkltusEED9I.html
23-05-2020||Delhi||‘Sensitive’ Anand Vihar made off-limits to buses to stop large gatherings||Anand Vihar in east Delhi, which shares its border with Uttar Pradesh’s Ghaziabad and considered a major transport hub of the national capital given that it houses an interstate bus terminal and a railway station, has been classified as a ‘no-go zone’ for Delhi buses by the government in an effort to prevent a large-scale gathering of people as was seen in the initial days of the nationwide lockdown on March 28 and 29. Even as the rest of the city is being catered to by buses and other modes of transport since May 18, no Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) bus or cluster bus is being allowed to make trips to the Anand Vihar area, the Anand Vihar ISBT or the railway station, much to the distress of the residents there. Even para-transit modes such as auto-rickshaws are being permitted only after thorough police checking, senior government officials said on Saturday.“The Anand Vihar bus route is usually one the busiest in the city. We received directions from the district administration and the Delhi Police not to ply buses to Anand Vihar as the area has been categorised as “sensitive”. The bus terminal is completely shut and has been made off-limits by police barricades,” a senior government official, on condition of anonymity, said.In the absence of the Metro, residents were hoping to least take buses to work, but now that, too, is not an option. “While the rest of the city is able to avail of bus services, we are not. Auto-rickshaws are hardly seen in the area, and the few that are there charge twice or three times the metre fare. My office opened this week and I mostly take a lift from my colleague to office, or sometimes, I book a cab,” Khushbu Rai, a resident of D Block Railway Colony, Anand Vihar, said.A senior official in the district magistrate’s (Shahdara) office said the move is aimed to avoid any form of congregation in the area. “In the last two days, there were reports of migrant workers crowding the area again, not on a large scale though. The problem is that the area also has the Kaushambi bus terminal on the other side, and many migrant families started coming to Anand Vihar in the hopes of boarding a bus to their home towns at least from the other side,” the official quoted above said.Another official in the Delhi transport department said the UP government is also not running interstate buses. “If migrants simply reach Anand Vihar hoping to return home, it will be a futile effort. Only those who have applied to the administration and have been cleared for travelling can get a seat on a bus or a train. There are no interstate buses plying other than those which have been coordinated by the two states. Also, the Anand Vihar railway station is operational only for Shramik Special trains (meant exclusively o ferry migrants home),” the official said.Days after the nationwide lockdown was announced on March 24, thousands of migrant workers had flocked to the Anand Vihar interstate bus terminal hoping to catch a ride home. At least a lakh migrant workers had gathered on the road outside the terminal, and many had tried to cross the border and find a bus from the Kaushambi terminal. Kejriwal had then urged migrant workers to stay back and promised them shelter and regular meals.The gathering of migrant workers in large numbers, which led to blatant violation of social distancing norms, led the Union ministry of home affairs to suspend two top bureaucrats of the Delhi government, while issuing show cause notices to two others for ‘dereliction of duty’ regarding containment of spread of Covid-19. The Delhi Police had then filed cases against cluster bus drivers and officials for taking their buses out on the roads and ferrying migrant workers to Anand Vihar.Officials in the DTC said they are plying over 1,000 buses for public transport across the city and around 1,600 are deployed for transportation of migrant workers and for maintaining law and order. Also, a 1,000 cluster buses are plying in the city currently.“Since the passenger numbers are more than what the available buses can cope with -- each bus can carry only a maximum of 20 passengers at a time to ensure social distancing -- we have identified 185 routes on which buses can operate on a rotational basis,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/sensitive-anand-vihar-made-off-limits-to-buses-to-stop-large-gatherings/story-g2vKiPoPp7s1dCSArznVKK.html
23-05-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram’s 100 cases linked to Delhi, say health officials||With 12 new Covid-19 cases reported on Saturday, the total tally of persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes coronavirus disease or Covid-19) in the district has reached 262. Of these, at least 100 cases are linked with Delhi, according to the district health department officials. A detailed report has been shared with the state government based on contact tracing, said the officials.“At least 100 Covid-19 patients in Gurugram contracted the virus after coming in contact with people who got infected in Delhi. Be it a policeman, ambulance driver or an essential service provider, who contracted the virus in Delhi while doing the duty, had spread the infection to at least two to three people in most of the cases,” said Dr Jaswant Singh Punia, chief medical officer (CMO).At least 15 patients attended Tablighi Jamaat at Nizamuddin in Delhi, and 30 people from Khandsa mandi, who tested Covid-19 positive had links with Delhi’s Azadpur Mandi. Likewise, patients from Dundahera, Sirhol, Jyoti Park, Palam Vihar, sector 10A, Shivaji Park, Jawahar Nagar and Bajghera had links with people who contracted the virus in Delhi.According to Punia, the maximum cases are from Khandsa and Dundahera, where contact tracing has shown links with the national Capital.Of the 12 cases reported on Saturday, four are from Devi Lal Colony, while one each from Surat Nagar, Rajeev Nagar, Satguru Enclave, Rajendra Park, 8 Biswa, Sector 37, Khandsa and Naya Basti have tested positive for Covid-19 positive. Of the 262 cases, 108 are hospitalised.International travellers test positiveTwo international travellers from the USA, who arrived in Gurugram on Thursday under Vande Bharat Misssion have tested Covid-19 positive. “Two from the United States of America and at least one from another country, who were brought back to the country under Vande Bharat Mission, tested Covid-19 positive. They have been admitted in ESIC Hospital in Sector 9 and Medeor Hospital, Manesar,” said Punia. According to officials, more than 350 international passengers have arrived in Gurugram as a part of the country’s biggest repatriation exercise to bring back Indian citizens. The travellers are kept under quarantine in different hotels. Based on their symptoms, the health team has been taking samples. Maruti employee tests positiveIn a major development, auto major Maruti Suzuki late, on Saturday evening, said that one employee of the company’s Manesar plant tested positive on Friday, for Covid-19. The company spokesperson said that the employee’s last attendance in the plant was on May 15 with normal health after which his residence area came under a containment zone and he did not join work thereafter.The company has informed the district administration. The employee has been admitted to a hospital and is stable. The company is providing all medical help and assistance to him as per government guidelines. The company has undertaken a contact tracing exercise and all employees who possibly could have come in contact with him have been advised to stay in home isolation. There is no impact on the business operations of the company. There may be a possibility of a second case of infection that has just been reported. More information is being sought. The company will follow the same detailed procedure as above, said the company’s spokesperson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/100-cases-in-gurugram-linked-to-delhi-say-doctors/story-hH24yg3HcQbygoVdydtEIM.html
23-05-2020||Chandigarh||No violation of fundamental rights in keeping religious places closed: Punjab, Haryana HC||The Punjab and Haryana high court has held that there is no violation of fundamental rights in keeping religious places closed due to the covid-19 outbreak. “Freedom to religion is subject to public order, morality and public health and there is no violation of religious rights of a community. It is an extraordinary situation. To safeguard the health of the society, restrictions have been imposed by closing down all the places of worship for public,” the bench of justice Rajiv Sharma and justice Ajay Tewari observed while dismissing a public interest litigation (PIL).Malerkotla resident Mubeen Farooqi had filed the PIL, alleging violation of fundamental rights of a person in keeping the religious places closed and allowing markets etc to open. He had challenged the March 24 guidelines of the Union home ministry, which were relaxed for other purposes from time to time but not for religious places. He had demanded that mosques be allowed to open on Eid and Gurdwaras be allowed to open on May 26 on the martyrdom day of Guru Arjan Dev.The bench further observed that the scope of judicial interference in policy matters is very limited. The policy decision can be challenged only if it is unconstitutional, arbitrary or irrational. But in the case in hand there is no arbitrariness.“The endeavour of the Union ministry of home affairs is to break the cycle by maintaining social distancing. The right of the state to impose restrictions, as are required or found necessary on the ground of public order, health and morality is inbuilt under Articles 25 and 26 of the Constitution of India,” the bench held, adding that the restrictions are in collective interest of the society at large. Articles 25 and 26 protect religious rights of a citizen, but with certain conditions such as public order, morality and health.The court added that merely because restrictions had been relaxed in certain areas, it could not be a ground to relax the same for religious places of worship. The discretion not to permit opening of all the places of worship for public and prohibiting holding of religious congregations/gatherings has been exercised judiciously, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-violation-of-fundamental-rights-in-keeping-religious-places-closed-punjab-haryana-hc/story-AazKmUQHjMNaE6Q11UlS3L.html

23-05-2020||Gurugram||Residents cast vote, elect governing body under lockdown guidelines||The district registrar of societies and firms on Saturday held elections to choose a governing body for residents’ welfare association (RWA) of Ramprastha Atrium, a group housing society in Sector 37D.The registrar said the elections were held as per the guidelines laid down by the union ministry of home affairs (MHA) for the fourth phase of the nationwide lockdown.Digvijay Singh, district registrar of societies and firms, said, “The casting of votes took place in the presence of government-appointed officials and police officers. social distancing norms were followed in the entire exercise— the ground was marked for voters to stand with adequate physical distance in between, masks were distributed among other measures.

23-05-2020||Gurugram||Banquet halls allowed to operate with limited guests, social distancing||The state government has allowed banquet halls and wedding venues to function but with riders pertaining to the number of guests allowed and the norms of social distancing to be maintained. For holding a wedding or a social function in a banquet hall, the organiser or the host will have to take permission from the deputy commissioner or similar authority. Further, the number of guests would be limited to 50. The state government on Friday issued directions in this regard. As per the norms fixed by the government, all the guests, who attend a wedding or a function, should wear masks, maintain a distance of at least six feet and follow all safeguards prescribed for public places. They also need to download the Aarogya Setu mobile application on their mobile phones, a direction by the state government said.The host will have to ensure that names, addresses and phone numbers of all the guests are noted in a register. Further, arrangements for hand sanitisers at the gate and thermal scanning for checking temperature should be made. Any one whose body temperature is more than 99.5 Fahrenheit would not be allowed to enter the premises, the direction said. The government has also banned the use of liquor, tobacco and betel leaves within the premises. No central air-conditioning would be allowed. The seating arrangement should also be made in such a manner that the guests will be placed at a distance of minimum 6 feet from one another, the direction stated.The owners of banquet halls and tents in the city, however, want the government to relax these norms as these norms are too stringent and would not allow the business activity to resume in any way. “The number guests fixed by the government is far too less and we have decided to meet the deputy commissioner in this regard. We are ready to follow all norms but the number of guests should be increased to 200 in June and then 300 in July,” said Anil Rao, president, Haryana Tent Dealers Association.Rao said that business worth crores has been lost in the past two months and the government must support all stakeholders in rebuilding the industry. “Not only owners but several workers have incurred losses,” he said. There are around 150 banquet halls and open sites in the city where weddings and other similar social functions take place. The directions also stipulated that barber shops, beauty parlours and salons, which are allowed to operate, should not let in customers, who have any influenza-like symptoms. Also the shop owners will have to sanitise all the equipment used after serving every customer.The government also said that there was no need for a mandatory weekly off for markets as ordered earlier as shops were only opening for only three days a week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/banquet-halls-allowed-to-operate-with-limited-guests-social-distancing/story-b8KORzl4GoFeTV7IDppQUN.html
23-05-2020||Gurugram||Fire at sanitiser manufacturing unit in Kherki Dhaula, no injuries reported||A major fire broke out on Saturday at a private company’s manufacturing unit in Kherki Daula with two floors of the three-storey building completely gutted. It took fire department officials nearly seven hours and more than 20 fire tenders to control the fire. No injuries were reported in the incident. According to fire department officials, they received a call about the fire around 9.15 am. They said the fire took place at Stella Industries Limited which usually makes cosmetics, toiletries, personal care products among other such items but has been mainly involved in manufacturing hand sanitisers ever since the national lockdown to control the spread of coronavirus disease was enforced on March 25.IS Kashyap, assistant divisional fire safety officer, said the basement, ground, and first floor of the building were completely gutted in the fire, while the firefighters were able to contain the blaze on the second floor and most of the items there were saved. The three-storey building, located next to the Delhi-Gurugram Expressway, is spread across 12,500 square metres.The extent of the blaze was such that more than 20 fire tenders from Gurugram, Manesar, Faridabad, and Noida were used in the dousing operations.“The fire was largely controlled around 4pm and was confined to a section of the basement of the building where a lot of chemicals used in hand sanitisers were stored haphazardly. The chemicals used in making hand sanitisers are highly flammable due to which there were heavy smoke and sparks,” said Kashyap.Kashyap said the fire is expected to douse completely around midnight. He said that since 4pm, 12 fire tenders were engaged in dousing the smoke and the flames inside the basement of the building.Fire department officials said that they suspect the fire may have been caused by a short circuit or one of the machines used in processing the goods may have developed a snag leading to burnout and subsequently causing the fire. They said that the exact cause would be only determined upon thorough inspection of the site. “We found slippers and shoes inside the building while controlling the flames which indicate that there may have been workers inside when the fire occurred. However, we have not been able to speak to the company officials so far to ascertain the same,” said Kashyap.However, a police officer at the spot said that there were nearly 60-70 workers inside the building when the fire started but they all managed to flee unharmed.The heavy cloud of smoke had caused panic among the locals in Kherki Daula village. Many shop owners shut their stores and residents who lived close to the spot left their homes and went to safer distances as a precautionary measure, said police officers. Kashyap said the company had obtained a conditional No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the fire department as its building plan was pending approval. Despite repeated calls on the contact number listed on the company’s website, there was no response from Stella Industries Ltd. Last month, a hand sanitiser manufacturing company in Sector 37 had caught fire on April 26. No injuries were reported in that incident as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/fire-at-sanitiser-manufacturing-unit-in-kherki-dhaula-no-injuries-reported/story-LK5Y74yFAM1XklgqWOZPXP.html
23-05-2020||Gurugram||Couples reconsider their wedding celebrations in a post-pandemic world||The venue was fixed, the shopping for trousseau completed and the deposits made to various vendors. The wedding that city resident Chitwan Lamba had been planning for the past one year was about to come true on May 3 but then the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic broke out. As restrictions on the movement started coming into force from late March onwards, Lamba and her family took the hard decision to postpone the wedding. “We had to postpone it because of the lockdown. Everything had been planned but we did not have any other option. My parents were sad but you can’t help it. On the other hand, they get to spend more time with me so you can’t complain about that either,” said Lamba, a 28-year-old doctoral research scholar with IIT Delhi. The pandemic, however, has not just changed the date of Lamba’s wedding but also the scale and nature of it. What might have been a large-scale affair with friends, family members and relatives has now being scaled down to a small celebration with close friends and family to mark the occasion.“We have not yet decided on the next date for the wedding but it will surely be a small one. It can also be celebrated at home with just a few close friends and family members. We are yet to decide on it,” said the Sector-73 resident. Lamba is not alone in changing her wedding plans. Several brides and grooms in the country are re-imagining their wedding celebrations in a post-pandemic situation. The current situation calls for compromises, adjustments and changes to be made to the long-established concept of a big fat Indian wedding.Government restrictionsThe district administration of Gurugram, in its revised order on May 23, said that marriage-related gatherings shall ensure social distancing and a maximum of 50 guests. The order, which is similar to wedding-gathering orders being followed in several parts of the country, is expected to change certain characteristics of the Indian wedding with restrictions on consumption of alcohol, supervision by nodal officers and ban on the use of central air-conditioning at the venue. Wedding planners and couples are grappling with newer challenges like the reduced number of guests, sanitation, social distancing and reduced contact. This challenge has led to maintaining a tight balance between tradition and precaution. Sanitation and hygiene “The responsibilities of holding a wedding during this time has doubled up as you have to look into other factors like sanitation and hygiene, where we would need dedicated teams for it. It can start from the gate to the buffet to the washroom. We might just have staff at the base of the stage with sanitisers for guests before they meet and greet the bride and the groom. Certain aspects are going to change. For instance, eating at weddings is now going to be more of a sit-down affair than an open buffet, where you eat standing up. We have to think of innovative ways of organising the baraat (wedding procession) as the horse and chariot are no longer feasible options. We might opt for a no-contact delivery of gifts, e-invites and other such things but the essence of the Indian wedding will remain the same,” said Ruchika Arora Bansal, director of Gurugram-based wedding organiser, Plush Weddings. She added that for couples approaching her to get married this year, her personal advice has been to postpone the wedding. Dates are available for June, July and August but Bansal said that the season picks up only after October.Deciding on the scaleDeciding the scale of the wedding has become a priority for couples. While some do not want to give up the opportunity of having a big celebration, others do not want to give the occasion a miss due to the forced small scale of the celebration. “I am ready to get married in the presence of merely 50 close guests as I don’t want to miss out the auspicious date that was pre-decided. We have invited only our closest relatives and friends. A wedding is such an occasion that comes only once in a lifetime. So we don’t want to miss out on the celebration,” said Prerna Singh, a 28-year-old bank executive, who is going to hold the ceremony on May 24 in Gurugram. She added that once the lockdown is lifted and the restrictions are removed, she will be throwing a bigger party for friends, families and relatives. Proper timingRestrictions, such as the cap on the number of guests and travel limitations, are also forcing couples to rethink the timing of the wedding. While some have postponed the weddings, which were scheduled to be held in the months of May and June, to the end of the year, several others are thinking of altogether skipping 2020. “Weddings are going to be much smaller affairs so a lot of them are going to shift to homes and smaller outdoor spaces. There will be a virtual element to all weddings going forward because there might be travel restrictions and older people may not want to leave the house. As such, we can expect online streaming of the occasion. There will also be a lot of online shopping because people don’t want to step out unnecessarily like visit multiple venues or visit a lot of small markets. The traditional wedding of the past with numerous ceremonies will no longer be possible. Instead, the focus will be on creating smaller ceremonies that are well-curated and unique,” said Sanna Vohra, founder and CEO of The Wedding Brigade. She added that ceremonies are primarily centered around close family members who participate in them. However, now the consideration to be made by organisers is how many people outside the close circle will get to witness the celebrations. She further added that 2021 is expected to be a busy year for weddings as those that were not held in 2020 are going to take place next year. Food choicesReduced guests also mean that the number of food items being served will also be curtailed. Ruchika stressed that guests are leaning more towards sit-in arrangements for dining to help maintain physical distance. “A total of eight weddings, which were supposed to happen in May-end and the June first week, have been cancelled. Along with this, our clients have asked us to cut down the items in the menu considering only 50 people would be attending it. People are going forward with intimate dining rather than a buffet layout. They are more interested in pre-plated food so that less food is handled by the client. We have introduced a seven-course tasting menu for the same and are also coming up with immunity-boosting dishes in the menu,” said Karann Talwar, chef and managing director of Kitchen Kraft Luxury Catering.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/couples-reconsider-their-wedding-celebrations-in-a-post-pandemic-world/story-nekmgoCEaR7E3xaFVLoG6N.html
23-05-2020||Gurugram||Two arrested for charging Rs 5,000 for issuing passes||Faridabad police on Saturday arrested two men for allegedly charging ₹5,000 from migrant workers for issuing movement passes through the Saral portal during the lockdown. The suspects were identified as 25-year-old Vikash Kumar alias Vicky and 29-year-old Pankaj Singh, both residents of SGM Nagar in Faridabad, said police. Vicky, ran a money transfer service and Pankaj ran a Common Service Centre (CSC) there, they said.The Saral portal is a Haryana government project that helps digitise certain services. When the lockdown was announced on March 24 to contain the spread of Covid-19, the government said people could apply for movement passes through the SARAL portal. The facility is available only for emergency cases and essential services.Anil Kumar Yadav, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that they were informed on Thursday evening that some people at the CSC were charging money for the services. “We formed a team and sent a decoy customer who only had an Aadhar card and driving license and wanted to go to Jaipur in Rajasthan and return. The man at the system asked for ₹5,000 and within minutes sent him e-pass on his WhatsApp,” he said. “We caught the operator red-handed and recovered the ₹500 denomination notes given by the decoy customer. They had charged more than 200 migrants with the e-passes,” said Yadav.Police said that when they questioned him, Vicky planned to earn money during lockdown as they were unable to bear their expenses and wanted to make their ends meet.According to the Saral portal, merely getting a pass would not be enough to ensure travel. They would have to provide other documents to officials upon inspection.The applications too would have to be approved from the district administration. Police said the suspects forged documents that indicated a medical emergency to ensure smooth passage for people at the borders and suspect the involvement of employees of district administration.“Pankaj used to spread the word among migrant labourers who were waiting for the passes to return to their home town. People used to come and he would charge them with full guarantee of a valid pass,” said Yadav.The suspects targeted stranded and uneducated people and told them that the centre was government approved and a branch of the Saral services from where they can get the passes within minutes.A case under sections 385 (Putting person in fear of injury in order to commit extortion) , 188 (Disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 420 (cheating) of Indian Penal Code and section 52 of disaster management act was registered against the suspects on Friday, said police.Yashpal Yadav, deputy commissioner, Faridabad, said that there have been incidents where people have duped the migrant workers on the pretext of sending them to their hometowns. “We are spreading awareness that the e-passes are free of cost and anyone who is unable to operate a smartphone can visit the district administration office in Mini Secretariat and their issues will be resolved,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/two-arrested-for-charging-rs-5-000-for-issuing-passes/story-ZbIvUsXlfMR0pDPF61yd0L.html

Hence, I have issued directions in this regard with immediate effect,” said Vinay Pratap Singh, commissioner, MCG.Singh cited several provisions of the Haryana Building Code, 2017, which mandates such a direction.As per clause 8.1(1) of the Haryana Building Code, rainwater harvesting system must be installed by the plot owner, constructing the building on the plot where the area of the rooftop is 100 square metres or more.Similarly, as per clause 8.1(2) of Haryana Building Code, recharging of groundwater shall be mandatory not only for residential buildings but for all types of buildings, including group housing societies having a plot area more than 500 square metres and above.“As the matter is very urgent and time-bound, non-compliance will be viewed seriously and action will be taken for non-compliance as per the provisions of law,” said Singh.The latest direction by MCG comes less than two weeks after the civic body issued directions to all its nine executive engineers to visit all rainwater harvesting pits in their respective areas and subsequently submit an estimate for cleaning and de-silting such structures on May 12.There are around 700 rainwater harvesting pits spread across the city, said MCG officials.As per an MCG release in August 2018, the city receives around 600-700 mm of rainfall every year, thereby making rainwater harvesting a necessary provision for recharging the groundwater table of the region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/mcg-makes-rainwater-harvesting-compulsory-for-all-residential-establishments-in-city/story-ngVO8myc8ZAD7raODYIyWK.html

Locals are purchasing some articles for their children. We are facing huge shortage of customers and losses. Eid is one of the biggest festivals in Malerkotla but due to lockdown and subsequent economic distress this year, shopkeepers are waiting for customers to show up,” said Anvar Mehaboob, who runs a garments business.Yasser Arafat, a Malerkotla resident, said that on one hand, curfew has badly affected local businesses, and on the other hand, people are upset with the authorities for not allowing religious places to open while liquor vends are doing business.“People are scared of getting coronavirus infection and are thus preferring to stay at home.

The officials said that they have received confirmation for start of flights on Hindon-Hubli route from May 25.“We are likely to start from May 25. We have received confirmation for operation of flights from Hindon to Hubli. The clearance from the air force authorities is waited and an internal process is being taken up by director general of civil aviation,” said Shobha Bhardwaj, director of the civil terminal at Sikandarpur.During the meeting with the district administration, the civil terminal officials have requested for certain facilities which will be helpful for passengers as well as staff members.“We have already taken up sanitization of the civil terminal, and markings have been made for passengers in order to maintain social distancing. The infrared thermal scanners are in place and everyone will be required to wear mask. Besides there will be repeated announcements as per protocol and SOP issued by the ministry of civil aviation. We have also requested the administration for making available the local transport for ferrying passengers and staff members, besides making available doctors as a precautionary measure,” Bhardwaj said.However, Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer, said that the health department will not be able to send team of doctors or ambulance to the civil terminal. “It is because most of our doctors are engaged in Covid-19 duties or deployed at 10 quarantine centres across Ghaziabad. So, we have written to the district magistrate that our doctors may not be available for deployment at the airport,” he said.District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey did not respond to calls. However, a statement issued by his office said that the district magistrate has spoken to private hospitals which may provide their doctors at the airport.“The municipal commissioner has been directed to depute a special team for taking up cleaning, etc. outside the civil terminal. The director of the airport has also been requested to submit the schedule of flights so that necessary arrangements can be made. The officials of the transport department have been asked to make arrangements for transport services,” said the statement.On May 21, the ministry of civil aviation said that the government has decided for recommencement of domestic air travel from May 25. The ministry had also said that apart from the safety of the passengers during the prevailing situation of Covid-19 pandemic, precautionary measures need to be taken by various stakeholders.Meanwhile, Amit Mohan Prasad, UP’s principal secretary (health), said on Saturday that the flights are likely to start from May 25.“The protocols are given by the ministry of civil aviation. Residents of UP coming in will be sent to home quarantine and those who plan to come here for some work will have to give details of return tickets and their place of stay, among others. However, a detailed protocol will be issued by Saturday,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gzb-gears-up-to-resume-flights-from-hindon-civil-terminal/story-MUPQGxkLP6Z6hB6GOApBfL.html

The state government is ferrying these migrants via trains. So far, it has transported 81,000 migrants from Delhi to UP’s eastern districts. These migrants were working either with factories, private firms, at construction sites or engaged in other jobs in Delhi, said officials. On Saturday, officials managed to send 8000 migrants with the help of seven trains, they said. “We sent 9,000 migrants, including students, on Friday on eight trains, which travelled from Delhi to Hardoi, Lucknow, Sultanpur, Jaunpur and Gazipur among other cities. We register migrants one day in advance and then transport them the very next day to their respective towns,” said Narendra Bhooshan, chief executive officer of the Greater Noida authority, who is the nodal officer for transportation of migrants from Delhi to UP.Anyone from UP, who is stranded in the national Capital and wants to register to go home, can call and get themselves registered with the following Greater Noida helpline numbers: 0120-2336001, 2336002, 2336003, 2336007 and 8920827174. The helpline number for Delhi is 011-2611051, while the Muradabad control room numbers are 9454400114, 7839855711, 7839854579, 7839854569, 9454402535 and 0591-2535733. Officials said that initially, these helplines were deployed in helping stranded migrants get food, medicine and other essential services in Delhi. Now, after the UP government decided to transport them to their respective home towns, these helplines have been deployed to help them register for transport and go home. With these helplines the facility is helping an average 10,000 people daily since May 16, when this service was started, said Bhooshan. Till May 22, the state government had transported a total of 73,000 migrants to their respective towns, Bhooshan added. This number, however, does not include migrants who are walking to their home towns or villages on foot or those who managed to board trucks. Officials said dedicated helplines have been launched for migrants stuck in different states and operations are underway to transport all of them home. Besides UP, the Delhi government also arranged buses to send migrants home to ensure they do not risk their lives while walking hundreds of kilometres home, said officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/around-10-000-migrants-being-sent-daily-to-up-towns-from-delhi-say-officials/story-1zvoUyhyNiL9DW4YLP9SbL.html
23-05-2020||City||Gzb allows entry of maids, other service providers into highrises||GhaziabadThe Ghaziabad district magistrate on Saturday issued an order that dictated that the entry of domestic helps, newspaper hawkers, electricians, plumbers and other people engaged in household works will not be restricted in highrises of the district. The officials said that such arrangement can be planned directly between the employer and the service provider and local RWAs can act only as advisors, conveners or as observers.Although issued late, the diktat by the Ghaziabad district magistrate is likely to come as a breather for residents who have been for long demanding the services of people engaged in household works. The residents said that certain RWAs had rolled out their own directions, preventing them from accessing the services of such people.“Things are opening up everywhere, except in containment zones. Entire city is now under Red zone but we have relaxed norms for certain activities, like opening of markets. The society associations cannot stop vendors or service providers from going to flats if residents require their help, be it technicians or newspaper sellers,” said Shailendra Singh, additional district magistrate, who is also the nodal officer appointed by the district magistrate.The directions issued by the district magistrate seemed to have clipped the wings of the RWAs and prevented them from becoming absolute minders of their societies .“The RWAs can take up proper sanitization at the gates and then allow the vendors/service provider to move in. They cannot stop such persons and should support the administration instead of issuing diktats. In the next couple of days, we will also be holding meetings with the RWAs and discuss their suggestions, if any. Everyone has to ensure that hygiene and protocols related to Covid-19 is followed,” he added.Residents hailed the order and said that proper enforcement and implementation should be taken up by the administration.“My domestic help was not allowed in the highrise ever since the lockdown was announced. As a result, I have been preparing food and cleaning the house as well as doing the utensils. I have a problem in walking, but there was no option. Sometimes my neighbours helped me out,” said Anita Srivastava, a senior citizen from Gaur Homes in Govindpuram.Others feel that the district administration should have issued supplementary guidelines and should have detailed precautionary measures for outsiders to be allowed into highrises.“There are many people, like senior citizens, who are living alone . There should be proper guidelines about safety and precautionary measures in case domestic helps, drivers or any other service providers are allowed to enter. Otherwise, they will be a risk to all the residents,” said BC Rastogi, a senior citizen from Kaushambi.“It was for two weeks that I was waiting to call a technician to fill up gas in my AC. After the directions were issued I called him up and allowed him to come into the house only after proper sanitization and precautions,” he added.Other residents also said that banning the entry of service providers, domestic helps have hit them hard financially.“Many domestic helps could not get their monthly payments and were rendered jobless. So, many families of domestic helps and small time service providers left for their hometowns. Many senior citizens and those living alone in highrises also suffered because of this as they were left to take care of all household works on their own as entry of helps was not allowed,” said Namita Gaur, a resident of Crossings Republik.The residents’ associations, on their part, welcomed the directions but said that the directions were issued a bit late.“Many highrises banned the entry of domestic helps and other smalltime service providers. We However, the order by the district administration came at the fag end of lockdown 4.0. It says that it will be an arrangement between the employer and the service provider. There is no clarity on accountability if someone gets infected,” said Colonel (retired) TP Tyagi, president of flat owners’ federation.“We will also ensure that domestic helps and other service providers who have not got their pending payments get their dues at the earliest,” he added.Office bearers of the federation of association of apartment owners, however, maintained that RWAs had not banned the entry of domestic helps or other service providers.“It was just that the lockdown was announced and people were asked to stay where they are. So, the entry became restricted. The RWAs, as per the direction of the DM, will not restrict any domestic help or service providers and will ensure that there is proper sanitization and cleanliness which is maintained,” said Anil Sharma, secretary of the federation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gzb-allows-entry-of-maids-other-service-providers-into-highrises/story-Mkb8dwrD1Gu1qjSIvmhswI.html

23-05-2020||City||G Noida: Nearly half of paramilitary jawans who contracted Covid-19 discharged in three weeks||GREATER NOIDA: As many as 96 personnel from different paramilitary forces, who had caught the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease while on duty, have been discharged so far from the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF) referral hospital at Lakhnawali camp in Greater Noida. Officials said the personnel were discharged after spending their mandatory span of quarantine in the isolation ward of the hospital. Till date, a total of 210 Covid-19-positive CAPF jawans have been admitted to this hospital.According to Dr Dinesh Chandra Dimri, inspector general (medical) and the in-charge of the hospital, out of the total patients, 158 belong to the Indo Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), 38 to the Border Security Force (BSF), five to the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), two to the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and one each to the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) and National Security Guard (NSG). “Besides them, four family members of CAPF personnel and one civilian had been admitted to the hospital after they had tested positive for Covid-19. The hospital was declared a designated Covid-19 hospital for CAPF personnel on May 1. Since then, we have treated and discharged 96 coronavirus patients, which include 66 from ITBP, 28 from BSF and one each from the CRPF and the CISF,” he said.He further said that the hospital has ample supply of protective equipment such as personal protective equipment (PPEs) and masks. “We are using the latest and advanced technology to help treat our patients. Recently, we introduced robotic machines, which are being used to serve food, water, medicine to patients without anyone coming in direct or indirect contact of the patients. These machines can be operated and navigated through remote control,” he said.He added that over 25 doctors, besides over 75 nurses and para-medical staff, are involved in treating Covid patients at the CAPF referral hospital. “They have been classified into different groups. When a group’s job is over after treating patients in their respective units, we send that particular group on 14 days’ mandatory quarantine as a precautionary measure,” he said.Meanwhile, doctors treating Covid-19 patients in the hospital said that despite many odds, their efforts have not wavered. Dr Shailendra, a specialist physician, said he has not gone for the past 20-25 days. “To provide round-the-clock services to my patients, I am residing in the officers’ mess which is adjacent to the hospital. Of course, I miss my family. But treating these brave soldiers, who have been infected while performing their duties, is more important,” he said.Echoing similar views, Dr Pawan and Dr Pipreet, also said they derive happiness from the fact that a lot of jawans are treated and discharged. “It gives a different type of job satisfaction. The organisation or the nation is the first family for every soldier,” they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/g-noida-nearly-half-of-paramilitary-jawans-who-contracted-covid-19-discharged-in-three-weeks/story-8ELW7UqesHvmeUyJtfoANJ.html

The terms of the settlement are confidential. I have no further comment to make,” she told the Daily Mirror.She is likely to have received a six-figure sum in pounds and signed a non-disclosure agreement, which means the details of the case cannot be aired in public.“Worked with some fabulous people. Had some good times and painful experiences but I know I made a difference,” Sandhu said soon after she quit the Met Police in October last year.The former officer took the legal step at the end of an internal Met Police investigation, which exonerated her of gross misconduct in June last year.The inquiry, launched in June 2018, focussed on whether Sandhu encouraged her colleagues to support her nomination for a Queen’s Police Medal (QPM), which is awarded twice a year by Queen Elizabeth II as part of her honours’ lists.The medals are given to serving police officers in the UK in recognition of distinguished service or outstanding courage in the line of duty.The internal Met Police investigation concluded that Sandhu had “no case to answer” and would face no further action, with restrictions on her duties at work being lifted.Sandhu, who joined the police service in 1989, rose through the ranks to become Borough Commander in Richmond-upon-Thames.She was one of the most senior ethnic minority woman officers in the Met Police and in 2006 received an Asian Women of Achievement Award for her achievements in the police force.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-origin-woman-police-officer-settles-scotland-yard-racism-case/story-XkbkzESyROwSf7DUa63z8K.html

The incident began after Sunil intervened in an argument of truck drivers in the market over weight of their consignments to be sent out during the lockdown. Eyewitnesses claim that one of the assailants and the main accused, Randhir Singh, was dressed as a nihang, and was inebriated at the time of the incident. DSP City BK Singla, however, has denied that any of the four assailants is a nihang. On April 12, a Nihang had chopped off the hand of an assistant sub-inspector in Patiala. The other accused are Gurmeet Singh, Mangal Singh and Ravinder Singh. The victim Sunil has sustained injuries in his back and is admitted to the Batala civil hospital. The main accused, Randhir, has been arrested, but is also admitted to the civil hospital with injuries. The rest of the accused are absconding. Batala grain market president Malkit Singh said authorities needed to increase the security at the market for them to work peacefully. All accused have been booked under Section 353 (using assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) and 186 (voluntarily obstructing public servant from duty) of the Indian Penal Code.STRAP/BLURB Four men attacked him after a dispute over weight of a truck consignment; police refute eyewitness claim that the main accused is a nihang||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/markfed-inspector-assaulted-in-batala-grain-market-1-held/story-Wz876cOu6pDOnpZlYeHB7M.html

He said many projects were facing shortage of labourers after a sizable chunk of them left for home districts in Bengal, Odisha and Jharkhand after the lockdown relief.A senior RCD official said hundreds of unskilled migrants have already by engaged for desilting of culverts, removal of grass and shrubs around roads and strengthening road shoulders.Providing employment to migrants has become a mammoth task for the state government, especially in view of the mounting offensive by the opposition parties ahead of the state polls later this year . Various departments, including rural development department, industries department and agriculture department, have already proposed various schemes to create job opportunities for the migrants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/bihar-picks-5-000-skilled-migrants-for-road-projects/story-bqr1aNAgjM64iXbtqrWSxO.html
23-05-2020||City||‘Allow women employees from Kasara, Karjat to travel in locals operational for CR staff’||The Railway Passengers Association for commuters from Karjat and Kasara has written a letter to Central Railway (CR), requesting it to allow women employees from these areas working in emergency services like Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), hospitals, and the police department in Mumbai, to travel in local trains operating for railway staff.Employees from these areas are being provided with buses for their daily commute. However, they have complained that no social distancing is followed due to the maximum number of passengers in each vehicle. The passengers association has therefore requested CR to allow at least women passengers to travel in the locals which are functional for railway employees.“The letter with the above request was written to the CR headquarters in Mumbai and was also addressed to the railways minister Piyush Goyal, on 22 May. At present, there are around 1 lakh citizens from the Kalyan-Karjat-Kasara belt who are travelling towards Mumbai daily to attend their jobs in emergency services in various government agencies. These employees are provided with Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) buses, at specific stops,” said Shyam Ubale, general secretary, Railway Passengers Association (Kalyan, Kasara, Karjat).“The employees travelling in these buses have noticed that no social distancing is followed. Hence, we have requested that at least women passengers should be allowed to travel in the local trains functioning for railway employees,” said Ubale.A 33-year-old woman passenger from Vasind, who works at Mumbai Police headquarters, has to travel around eight kilometres from her home, to board the BEST bus at Asangaon. “It’s difficult to maintain social distance on the bus as every seat is accommodated by passengers. If extra passengers board, we also have to adjust and make space for them to sit. In such cases, it increases the risk as far as the spread of the pandemic is concerned. Permission to travel in local trains operational for railway workers could help to resolve this issue,” she said.Another 35-year-old woman passenger from Kasara, who works as a bank employee in Mumbai, said, “As the passengers increase in the bus, it’s difficult to follow social distancing. After returning home, we may pose a risk to our family members, especially our children. Train travel will also reduce our daily commute time. We request CR to consider our request, at least for women passengers travelling to CSMT, who are serving in various government agencies,” she said.Local train services were made functional only for railway employees since Thursday, with limited services, informed a CR official from Mumbai.“Though the trains have been made functional, they are limited and exclusively for railway staff who have been deployed for essential services like operations of Shramik special trains. At present, these local services for railway employees are operated in the morning and evening between CSMT and Karjat and Kasara,” said a senior CR official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/allow-women-employees-from-kasara-karjat-to-travel-in-locals-operational-for-cr-staff/story-YC1mvICJyEVw6NJgfwcYfL.html
23-05-2020||Mumbai||Governor, CM like father and son, says Sena MP after meeting at Raj Bhavan||Amidst tension between Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari and the Maha Vikas Aghadi government, Shiv Sena leader and Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Raut on Saturday met the latter at Raj Bhavan. Raut later said that it was a courtesy call and there were no differences between his party and the Governor.Raut remarked that the relations between Koshyari and chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray are like those between a father and son. The meeting lasted for more than 20 minutes and Raj Bhavan later tweeted that it was a courtesy call by the MP. Raut’s visit is being seen as an attempt to attain a truce between the ruling party and Raj Bhavan. The meeting assumes significance as Raut had staunchly criticised Raj Bhavan for the delay in appointing Thackeray to the legislative council after the state cabinet recommended his name for the seat. Raut, while speaking to the media after his meeting, said that there were no differences between his party and the Governor. “The relations between the Governor and chief minister Uddhav Thackeray are very cordial and they respect each other. There are no differences between the two. Their relationship is like a father-son duo,” he said.The Governor on Friday had taken strong objection to higher and technical education minister and Shiv Sena leader Uday Samant’s letter to the University Grants Commission (UGC), requesting it not to conduct final year exams in the wake of the pandemic and lockdown. Governor Koshyari asked the CM to resolve the issue of the exams in the larger interest of the students. This is believed to be another episode of the ongoing tussle between the Governor and state government.Raut, however, tried to downplay the issue after the meeting and said, “The letter to the UGC was a personal opinion of the minister. What the Governor has said is his opinion. The issue will now be resolved by due deliberation.”Significantly, Raut has been a harsh critic of Koshyari. He had criticised the Governor by raising questions over delays in Thackeray’s appointment to the council. “Who is stopping him [Koshyari] from approving the recommendation?” he had questioned. Raut had earlier tweeted: “Raj Bhavan, governor’s house should not become centre for political conspiracy. Remember! History does not spare them who behave unconstitutionally. @maha_governor.”“Besides the tussle between the party and Governor Koshyari ahead of the government formation, there have been many occasions of tiffs between the ruling parties and Governor in the last six months. This is believably an attempt by the chief minister’s party to extend an olive branch to the Governor for them to begin the new relationship,” said a Sena leader.The MVA government — made up of Sena along with the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress — is also wary about the Governor not approving names given by the state for appointments to the 12 legislative council seats. The governor-appointed seats will fall vacant within the next three weeks. The attempt by Raut is also reportedly to minimise potential differences over the appointments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/governor-cm-like-father-and-son-says-sena-mp-after-meeting-at-raj-bhavan/story-gmnH3Cbts9p4Sq7GqjG4cK.html
23-05-2020||Mumbai||UP-bound Shramik train stops in Odisha; WR claims it was re-routed due to congestion||A few of the Shramik special trains being operated to transport migrant workers from the city to their hometowns in other states are taking longer to reach their destinations. According to the Western Railway (WR), this is due to the high number of trains — parcel and Shramik — being operated on the same routes without proper timetables, which has led to congestion. One such incident was highlighted when a Shramik train bound for Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh from Kalyan station (Central Railway) on Thursday, was rescheduled to leave from Vasai Road railway station (WR) instead due to congestion on the route. Because of this change, the train had to take an alternative route via Odisha.Passengers had expected to reach Gorakhpur by Saturday but the train instead stopped at Rourkela railway station in Odisha that afternoon. This led to confusion among passengers who thought the train was not going to its original destination. The passengers were also running out of food and water due to the extended journey.“Shramik special train set off to Gorakhpur (UP) from Vasai Road (Maharashtra) on 21st May, 2020 reaches Rourkela station in Odisha today morning. Clueless passengers claims that driver has lost the route. No official word from @WesternRly. Can someone help,” Twitter user @ritvick_ab posted online.Western Railway (WR) stated that the train was to depart from Kalyan railway station but due to heavy congestion on the route, it departed from Vasai Road railway station. It is expected to reach Gorakhpur today.“Vasai Road-Gorakhpur Shramik special train which departed on May 21 was to run on the Kalyan-Jalgoan-Bhusaval-Khandwa-Itarsi-Jabalpur-Manikpur route, but the train went to Gorakhpur via a diverted route [Bilaspur (SECR)-Jharsuguda-Rourkela-Adra-Asansol (ER), due to heavy traffic congestion on existing routes,” said Ravinder Bhakar, chief public relations officer, Western Railway.“Due to heavy congestion on the Itarsi-Jabalpur-Pt Deen Dayal Nagar route, it has been decided by the railway board to temporarily run the trains originating from Vasai Road, Udhna, Surat, Valsad, Ankleshwar of Western Railway, Konkan Railway, and some stations of Central Railway, on a diverted route via Bilaspur-Jharsugda-Raurkela.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/up-bound-shramik-train-stops-in-odisha-wr-claims-it-was-re-routed-due-to-congestion/story-evgd1yESM1A5TElRf6hWeN.html
23-05-2020||Patna||Centre gives a push to Bihar for scaling up testing||The Centre has decided to provide additional testing equipment to Bihar, in an effort to scale up testing for coronavirus in the state which is currently testing only around 2000 samples every day.An empowered group of officers (EG-2), created by the Central government to implement Covid-19 containment measures in the country, has recommended strengthening testing capability at the ICMR-Rajendra Memorial Research Institute of Medical Sciences (RMRIMS) in Patna.It has recommended equipping the RMRIMS with a ‘Cobas 6800’, a high-throughput instrument for conducting real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which is a confirmatory test for Covid-19. The instrument will be dispatched from ICMR-Bangalore in a couple of days.“The instrument will allow the RMRIMS to test 1,000 samples a day. It is likely to be dispatched in a couple of days from ICMR-Bangalore,” said CK Mishra, secretary, ministry of environment, forest and climate change, also the head of the Centre’s EG-2 on Covid-19. This group looks after medical aspects like testing, hospital preparedness and critical care. The Central government has created 11 empowered groups of officers for Covid-19 management.“We have also sent 22 TrueNat machines to Bihar and are also facilitating ICMR’s approval to a private testing lab in Patna for conducting RT-PCR tests. With these, Bihar will be able to selectively test little more samples,” Mishra said.He said high positivity of cases to samples tested in Bihar was little worrying. Bihar’s positivity of cases was around 12% as compared to the national average of 5%. However, with increased testing and better contact tracing, the state can do well to contain the spread of the virus, Mishra said.Bihar’s case doubling period was eight days (as on May 19) against the national average of 13.28 days. It was testing 466 out of every 1 million people, as of May 21.Chief minister Nitish Kumar has already asked his officers to ramp up testing from an average 2,000 to 10,000 per day. The state had tested a total of 2,920 samples on Thursday after eight health facilities in districts were recently equipped with TrueNat and CB-NAAT machines.Seventeen out of every 1 million people have now tested positive for the virus in the state, with the migrants accounting for almost 59% of the state’s total Covid-19 cases, which was 2,263 on Saturday afternoon. Eleven people infected by the virus have died so far.As of now, the RMRIMS has a capacity to test 800 to 1,000 samples a day. “Once we get the Cobas 6800 instrument, we will be able to test 1,800 samples in a day,” said its director, Pradeep Das.“The instrument requires negative-pressure room (Airborne Infection Isolation Rooms, which help maintain clean conditions). We are talking to different air-conditioning firms and it may take us a week or so to have the system in place,” said Das.Meanwhile, the ICMR has given its nod to the Sen Diagnostics Pvt Ltd on Budh Marg in Patna to conduct RT-PCR tests. This is in addition to the Dr Lal Path Labs in Patna and the Path Kind Diagnostics Pvt Ltd in Patna and Muzaffarpur.“We are arranging to have the system functional soon after creating a separate kiosk for collection of swab samples. We will conduct the confirmatory test for Rs 3,000,” said Dr Sandeep Sen, director of the Sen Diagnostics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/centre-gives-a-push-to-bihar-for-scaling-up-testing/story-465dcBCuVzBP17Xzl8Co8M.html

And this has suddenly made consumers look at household gadgets that make life easier in the absence of these employees. In the long wish list of consumers are robotic floor sweeping and mopping machines --- there are a wide variety of them in the market today, vacuum cleaners to remove dust from table tops and such surfaces, dish washers, vegetable and fruit cleaners. There is also, I find, added interest in newer models of food processors, roti making machines, washing machines and driers. But given the economic impact of the disease, there is also some hesitation in investing in these gadgets.Manufacturers therefore have to go all out to woo consumers with genuine discounts, offer of interest free instalments and promise of quick delivery and installation. In fact many consumers are worried about the possible contamination of the purchased products and so manufacturers and retailers have to reassure them about the measures that they are taking to prevent the spread of the virus from the goods delivered or from the delivery and installation personnel. Similarly, the delivery and installation have to be prompt and quick and both the personnel need to stick to the time schedules worked out with the consumers. Since many consumers are also interested in replacing their old machines with new ones, manufacturers should also come up with attractive exchange offers that considerably bring down the price of the gadget. As far as consumers are concerned, I would suggest that they not only make an informed choice in terms of quality and price, but also look at the energy consumption of the gadget. And of course they must read consumer reviews, particularly complaints if any, besides checking on the warranty offered by the company. Talking of warranties, many manufacturers and retailers push consumers into buying expensive extended warranties. I would advise consumers against it because an extended warranty is basically a ploy on the part of the manufacturer to earn some extra profits because he is too well aware that the possibility of a customer utilizing that warranty is relatively low. In other words, most good quality gadgets do not break down or require change of parts in the initial years, so why waste that money?Interestingly, a 2018 Stanford University (USA) study pointed out that the strong demand for extended warranties and the high profits accruing to the companies from the sale of such warranties stem from consumer misconception about the failure rate or the failure probability of the product. So “providing information to consumers about failure probabilities significantly reduces their willingness to pay for warranties…” the study said.In fact I would suggest that consumers put the money that they would spend on the extended warranty in a separate savings account, to be used for any replacement of parts or repairs if required during that period. If not, you have saved that amount!I would also suggest that you consider carefully, the usefulness of a product in the long run, before making a purchase decision. I remember those vacuum cleaners that many of us bought some three decades ago. They were hardly used because the house helps who did the sweeping and mopping were far more efficient.Similarly, before replacing your old gadget with a new one, consider whether the qualities and advantages being attributed to the new models are really true or just a marketing gimmick and whether you are really benefitting from changing the model and spending that extra amount. In short, be a smart consumer and make only those purchases that are to your advantage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/make-an-informed-choice-while-buying-household-devices-during-lockdown/story-EioG3EDuFRRbpWVbtjmQwN.html

Several social media users said the photograph was of Daati Maharaj and his followers.Hindustan Times could not independently verify the authenticity of the photos, but Delhi Police confirmed they were of the self-styled preacher at his temple in Asola.Deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Kumar Thakur said the visuals of a ceremony at Shanidham Mandir in Asola near Mehrauli showed that people present there were not following social distancing norms, and that the temple had been opened to the public despite government orders that has prohibited religious gatherings.Thakur said Daati Maharaj — the chief priest of the temple, and some others were at the temple for nearly three hours for the ceremony, starting at 7.30pm on Friday.During a preliminary enquiry, Thakur said, police found that Daati Maharaj, the chief priest of temple, along with some others had gathered for a ceremony for nearly three hours, starting at 7.30 pm on Friday.

A person, who answered the phone on a number mentioned on the temple’s website, said Daati Maharaj was “present in the temple but was unavailable for a comment”.A senior investigator, who did not want to be named, said they have learnt that a political leader was also present in the religious congregation.“We are examining CCTV footage from cameras installed at the temple and on the road outside. All those who violated the lockdown rules will be identified and booked in the case,” the investigator added.The self-styled preacher and his two associates were booked in 2018 for allegedly raping and sexually assaulting an inmate of his ashram. A case was registered on the woman’s complaint and it was transferred to the crime branch. The case was later transferred to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/self-styled-godman-booked-for-organising-congregation-at-delhi-temple/story-w6VGyhqZo1fyH7LKASCqSO.html

Most of them are returning to their hometowns only because the government is providing the free travel facility. The government should start charging for the journey. This way, most of the workers would stay back and the industry which is moving towards a crises, would be able to revive,” said CICU president Upkar Singh Ahuja and general secretary Pankaj Sharma. Knitwear Club president Darshan Dawar said, “Already reeling under losses, the hosiery industry is suffering a lot with the migrants returning to their home states.”“While the labourers are moving out of the city, there is no arrangement for those who want to return from other states and work. The labourers in the hosiery used to arrive in the city in the beginning of April, work for the entire season and then return to their hometown. But this year, the labourers are not able to come and the ones present in the city are exploiting the owners by charging more for work,” he said. Owner of one of the hosiery units in Wait Ganj area, Karan Bajaj, said that the labourers who were willing to work are also moving out after the government announced free travel facility. “We used to commence the manufacturing process in the April. This year, the hosiery industry is in a dilemma and wondering how to manufacture the goods in the absence of workers,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/stop-free-travel-facility-for-labourers-cicu-to-punjab-govt/story-Z5zTF90TaR0IDvxWG1ksvN.html

He is also seen taking rounds of the hospital premises in the clip.A nurse requesting anonymity said she was astonished on seeing the civil surgeon in shorts and T-shirt, which is a clear violation of the dress code.“Dr Sharma played with our lives. He was moving around the hospital without a face mask. The doctors and nurses are scared and they are not in a position to ask him to take precautionary measures while visiting the hospital. If our leader will violate the rules and regulations, what can we expect from the staff,” she added.On this, Independent MLA from Dadri, Sombir Sangwan, sent a complaint to chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar and health minister Anil Vij.“The surgeon’s dress code is not acceptable and the hospital is not his home where he can wear anything.

He threatened to launch a ‘dharna’ along with the farmers from June 2 if their dues were not paid by June 1.While addressing mediapersons here, Chautala said contrary to the government claims that farmers were being paid minimum support price (MSP) within 72 hours of procurement, there are a lot of farmers who had not been paid at all or paid partially since over three weeks. He threatened to launch a dharna if the farmers are not paid for every grain of wheat by June 1. Chautala said it is shocking to see that the government which had announced to set up procurement centres across the state, had failed to set up even a single procurement centre in the entire state. “Farmers in Ellenabad were informed telephonically by officials to bring their farm produce (gram) to the grain market but were sent back on plea that they had not received any government order in this context,” he added. He accused the state government of indulging in unfair means in delaying the payment to farmers with an aim to favour a particular private bank.When asked about the controversy pertaining to the liquor scam, Abhay who had demanded a probe by sitting judge of high court, alleged that the culprits had links with top functionaries of the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/abhay-chautala-threatens-to-launch-dharna-over-non-payment-to-wheat-growers/story-DwMx8mqxcH19aCiUs5WuuI.html

In the last five days, this is the fourth protest by different parent associations against fee-related issues in the city.The parents visited the school in the morning to meet the principal to request her to waive the enhanced charges from the tuition fee. When nobody from the school authorities came out to address them, the parents started protesting. Also, one of the parents fainted as the day temperature was 40°C.The protest continued for two hours and ended after police’s intervention, who assured them that they can meet the principal on Monday and also submit a memorandum.Neeraj Rattan, a parent, said, “My children have been studying in this school since many years, but in this time of financial crisis, we are unable to pay the enhanced tuition fee. The school authorities should cooperate with us. We have requested the state government to waive the admission fee charges.”Another parent, Pawan Chawla, said, “We are ready to pay the tuition fee, but the authorities have increased it. At such a time, they should not impose hefty fee charges. The school has also included computer fee and smart class charges in the tuition fee, which is not justified as the school has been closed for two months and these facilities have not been utilised.”School principal P Singh said, “We informed the parents to pay the tuition fee from April to June, but we did not increase it for this academic session. We will never think of enhancing the tuition fee in the times of crisis and wrong information has been circulated. We have to pay salaries to the teachers as they have been taking online classes regularly and the online assessment will start from June 1 for the students.”“I was not present in the school today and if any parent wants to meet me, can make an appointment. We cannot exempt the annual charges and parents have been informed to pay the same after the school reopens,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/parents-protest-against-school-authorities-in-ludhiana-for-increasing-tuition-fee/story-xn2cVpsvf1dJHMJRvlDlUK.html

23-05-2020||Kolkata||Sharp rise in Kolkata vegetable prices as supplies dwindle post Cyclone Amphan||Vegetable prices have shot up in Kolkata and its adjoining areas as supplies took a hit in West Bengal, which was battered by cyclone ‘Amphan’ earlier this week.Prices of most vegetables have risen by 20-30 per cent over the last two days, traders said.Road communication in several parts of the metropolis has been severely impacted as thousands of trees and electric poles lay scattered on the streets.West Bengal Vendors Association president Kamal Dey said on an average, 300 vehicles loaded with vegetables arrive in the city everyday, but the number has halved since Thursday.“The main supply hubs for the city are Basirhat, Bangaon, South 24 Parganas and all these places suffered huge damages due to the cyclone. At many places, fields are filled with knee-deep water,” he said.Unless the water recedes by Sunday, majority of the produce will perish and cause massive shortage of supply, Dey said.Lakhs of people were rendered homeless as cyclone ‘Amphan’ cut a path of destruction through half-a-dozen districts of the state on Wednesday, flattening houses, uprooting thousands of trees and swamping low-lying areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/sharp-rise-in-kolkata-vegetable-prices-as-supplies-dwindle-post-cyclone-amphan/story-ppPrbl75CqQMZPVbvJlbRL.html

The civic school teachers had been conducting the health survey for the past month and half. The Thane Municipal Corporation’s education department wants to give them a break.“The TMC school teachers needed a break from the survey work. Hence, we decided to give them 20 days off. Private school teachers will take over. Based on the situation after 20 days, we will take a call whether to continue with private teachers or get civic school teachers back,” said Rajesh Kankal, education officer, TMC.Around 400 civic school teachers were part of the healthy survey work.“For almost a month, we have been visiting containment zones and enquiring about symptoms and tell people precautionary methods. We are exhausted going from place to place,” said Aditi Sondur, TMC school teacher.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/tmc-school-teachers-to-get-a-break-from-survey-work/story-S9yv4Q20bmn3pwo6UL5EDL.html
23-05-2020||Bhopal||MP’s Covid-19 cases double in a fortnight as cases continue to spike||Covid-19 cases in Madhya Pradesh doubled in the past fortnight with total cases now over 6,100 with almost entire state affected from the pandemic, the state government data shows.The number of cases rose by 3,000 in the last fortnight after the state took 38 days to get first 3,000 cases when the spread was limited to 24 of the 52 districts, the state government’s data shows, hinting that how fast the infection has spread in the state even though the numbers are much less than neighbouring Maharashtra and Gujarat. The data also showed that hourly addition of Covid-19 patients has also increased. Since May 7, eight new patients were reported every hour which in the past one week increased to 10 patients per hour. As many as 49 districts out of the total are now Covid-19 districts covering 96.14% of the total population (State’s total population is 7.26 crore as per 2011 census), the data shows.Unlike many other states, the migrant labourers contribution to total Covid-19 cases in Madhya Pradesh is just 4.86%, showing the infection has spread fast locally.In Bihar, migrant workers accounted for 57% of the cases while in Odisha it was 62%. According to the Madhya Pradesh health department, about 300 labourers have tested positive accounting for only 4.86% of the total 6,170 patients registered till Friday evening. Around 5 lakh workers have returned to the state so far.Among the six states having highest number of Covid-19 cases, MP’s death rate at 4.40% with 272 deaths, is only next to Gujarat which has 6.04% death rate and 1.5 times more than the national average death rate at 2.97%.The saving grace was that the recovery rate of patients in MP is more than 45% and death rate has come down to 4.4% from about 6% a month ago. However, Covid-19 patients were being found in new localities even in hotspots areas. In Bhopal, Ujjain, Indore, the major Covid-19 hotspots, fresh cases are being reported from new localities. To aggravate the situation, the remote districts like Khandwa, Khargone, Burhanpur and Dhar have become major hotspots. Public health expert, Amulya Nidhi said the testing rate in the state was too small. “In the last two weeks the infection spread to about a dozen new districts. Madhya Pradesh is lagging far behind the testing capacity. MP has just 20 testing labs, whereas other states which have a comparable population of MP, such as Gujarat and Tamil Nadu have increased the number of labs up to 37 and 67 labs respectively. The number of tests is also significantly low in comparison to Maharashtra, Gujarat and Rajasthan, all neighbouring states.”Another public health expert, Sachin Jain, said, “The government was more focussed on political gains by talking of Jamaats and certain localities being epicentre of the disease and due to this entire state has had to pay the price. Even if the government feels that the virus originated and spread in certain localities it should have had an effective communication with civil society members for counselling, communicating with and convincing people in these localities to come forward to get themselves examined.”A government official who did not want to be named, conceded that the government was struggling with a shortage of testing kits.“There were suggestions for massive survey, screening, collection of samples and testing in Bhopal, Indore and Ujjain in particular but administration overlooked the advice as the government was struggling to have adequate number of testing kits. The health minister requested the Centre at least twice to send more kits. Also, the community penetration of the administration in Bhopal, Indore, Ujjain, Burhanpur, Khandwa and Khargone etc has hardly been up to mark.”He said, “How the government was cut off from the situation was reflected in its decision to notify BMHRC,Bhopal, the hospital meant for Bhopal Gas Tragedy victims, as a dedicated Covid hospital. Most of the tragedy victims hospitalised were shifted to other hospitals. The order was cancelled only when several gas tragedy victims died of Covid-19 and gas tragedy survivors organisations moved the high court.”In Ujjain, the government relied on a private medical college despite the fact there were numerous complaints from the Covid-19 patients admitted over there. It was only after the death of a ruling party corporator that the government woke up to appoint an administrator at the medical college, said a health department official who was not willing to be named.Chief medical and health officer (CMHO) at Indore, Praveen Jadia said ensuring compliance of lockdown restrictions and social distancing in congested localities remains a big challenge.“The death rate has come down and recovery rate has increased significantly but until and unless social distancing is ensured in such localities it’s difficult to say how much time it will take to control the situation,” he said.Collector Bhopal, Tarun Kumar Pithode also echoed similar concerns about congested localities and said it forced the administration to take people of some localities and quarantine them.“Social distancing was practically not possible in such areas line Zinci, Jehangirabad, Aishbagh, Talaiya, Mangalwara etc where we find a Corona cloud, a term we have given not because of any spread in atmosphere but dense population. That’s why we have started taking people out of these localities. We have taken 2,000 people out of Jehangirabad alone. This strategy coupled with strict containment zone plan and legal provisions have helped us and the number of positive cases is decreasing significantly.”Additional chief secretary, health department, Mohd Suleman said, “The R naught factor (A mathematical factor to indicate gravity of infectious disease) was 1.95 around April 1. This has gone down to 1.27. This suggests that multiplication of the virus has reduced. The doubling rate has slowed down to 17 days from 12 days. Recovery rate has gone up to about 47%. The death rate which used to be around 6% has come down to 4.2%. Our testing has been ramped up hugely which is about 1500 per million population now. All these are good indicators. Our testing and treating capacity has improved considerably. Fever clinics will further help us.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/mp-s-covid-19-cases-double-in-a-fortnight-as-cases-continue-to-spike/story-YqdvGyaLkLDa3ZlEHY0OjM.html

Some students, beneficiaries of the Government of India- Post-Matric Scholarship (GoI-PMS), graduating in 2020, have not been able to pay their fees owing to a delay in the disbursement of scholarship funds. Amid the lockdown, following the Covid-19 outbreak, it has become furthermore difficult to gather funds.Meanwhile, the institute has withheld the results of students with overdue fees. “We the members of TISS Students’ Union 2019-20 unreservedly condemn the arbitrary and unethical action of TISS administration in withholding the access for viewing the semester-end result by students of the graduating batch of 2020 on account of dues not being cleared. Furthermore, this has been followed by a complete lack of transparency in additional charges being levied on the students,” said the union in a statement.The student body has sought a waiver of the fees for these students, most of whom are first-generation learners. The institute has, however, indicated that it is not in a position to waive-off fees as it was facing a fund crunch.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/tiss-student-union-condemns-administration-for-withholding-results-against-non-payment-of-fees/story-ij7EaJBscuGytsVx7Tu6nM.html
23-05-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: Pvt school students directed to pay regular monthly fee from June||The directorate of school education on Friday said that private schools should accept requests from parents to defer payment of fees for the months of April and May in view of the ongoing lockdown. The deferred payment for these two months, however, can be collected by the schools in three months, starting June, in equal instalments.In a letter, shared with district education officers, the department also said that tuition fees on a monthly basis should be collected from those parents who could afford to pay and those who had not formally written to schools for a deferment. Further, it added that all students of private schools were expected to pay the monthly tuition fee regularly from June onwards, as per the normal routine followed in previous years. The Haryana government had issued orders regarding the payment of fees on April 23, according to which only monthly tuition fee could collected during the lockdown. Payment of other funds — such as building fund, maintenance fund, entrance fee, computer fee, among other additional heads — had been deferred. The government had also prohibited private schools from hiking tuition fees or introducing hidden charges in the fee, and asked schools to collect tuition fee on a monthly basis.Though the department’s Friday order reiterated all the above points, it was mum on whether any action will be taken if schools prevented students from attending classes due to non-payment of fees. A number of parents have been seeking a concession or a waiver of fee for the duration of lockdown given the financial strain and due to job losses. Kailash Sharma, general secretary, Haryana Abhibhavak Ekta Manch, a parents’ body, said the government has been issuing directions without any sincerity. “This is the seventh such letter on the issue of fee payment that has been issued by the government. It is a joke on parents since schools have not been abiding by previous directions on fee payments anyway. We have filed two complaints with the Prime Minister’s office seeking an audit of the accounts of private schools,” said Sharma.District education officer Indu Boken couldn’t be reached for a comment||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-pvt-school-students-directed-to-pay-regular-monthly-fee-from-june/story-1lAQo3e9xPGIWJkuU0b3JI.html

Now they have set a target of 3 lakh tweets for June 6 trend.Agriculture expert Devinder Sharma has termed the development a new beginning for farmers. “The support to the previous trends reflects that farmers now understand they have to highlight their issues on social media platforms as they can’t lodge protests on the streets right now.”“This is a weapon that will at least start a debate on farmers’ issues,” he added.Ramandeep Singh Mann, an agriculture activist from Delhi, said, “Now, farmers understand that if they tag the Twitter handles of PM and agriculture minister, their issues will reach the concerned ministers. Secondly, they feel that highlighting their issues on Twitter will also find resonance among fellow citizens.”“We will arrange workshops to bring maximum farmers on Twitter, as it is the best and cheapest way for them to raise their voice amid the lockdown,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/protesting-digitally-farmers-join-twitter-to-speak-out-trend-their-issues-on-social-media/story-9bfv2PKXu3TCckHGr9C7uN.html

The victim has been identified as Parkash Kumar, 44, who hailed from Uttar Pradesh and had been living in Ludhiana for the past 30 years.The accused, identified as Manga, 38, of Badwar village of Barnala, himself raised an alarm and alerted the store owner, assuming that if he did so, police would not suspect him.But as he kept changing his statements regarding the sequence of events, police grew suspicious. After repeated questioning, the accused confessed to killing Parkash with a wooden log after he allegedly hurled casteist slurs at him. Both were in an inebriated state at the time of the incident.Inspector Prem Singh, Mullanpur Dakha station house officer, said that Manga initially told the police that four motorcycle-borne miscreants had struck at the store in the wee hour of Saturday and started assaulting him with sticks and iron rods. “He said that to escape the attack, he fled from the spot and on returning, he saw Parkash lying in a pool of blood,” said the inspector.At around 5.30am, he informed the store owner Gurtej Kaur, who then informed the police. “But as Manga frequently kept changing his statements, we grew suspicious. He later confessed that both of them had consumed liquor and Prakash had allegedly verbally abused him following which he killed him in a fit of rage,” said the inspector. Police have recovered the murder weapon from the accused and booked him under Section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code.Gurtej Kaur revealed that Parkash had been working at the store for the past 30 years. He was 13 years old when he had come to the village in search of job.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/man-bludgeons-co-worker-to-death-in-mullanpur-dakha/story-Ly5Asu1mjZ4aCaDa5uZmcI.html

As many as 1,079 are in home quarantine,” Principal Secretary (Medical and Health) Amit Mohan Prasad said. He added that so far, over 2 crore people have downloaded the App and 30,994 people have been called. The principal health secretary also said a large number of migrant workers are coming from other states with ASHA workers having surveyed 7.44 lakh of them so far. “Of these, 844 appeared to have corona symptoms and their samples have been taken for testing,” he said. “If no COVID-19 symptom is found in migrant workers, they are sent for a 21-day home quarantine. If found symptomatic, they are tested. On testing positive for infection, they are given treatment,” he said. Members of the village and colony monitoring committees are keeping a close watch on migrant workers, and ensuring that home quarantine is strictly adhered to, he said. “If we strictly adhere to home quarantine and the migrant workers discharge their social responsibilities, the infection would be controlled,” Prasad added. “A total of 8,112 samples were tested on Friday. We will soon touch the 10,000 mark for testing. As many as 836 pools were tested, of which 143 pools tested positive,” he said. The principal secretary also talked of domestic flights resuming from May 25. “The protocol for fliers will be issued by the Union Civil Aviation Ministry. The passengers will have to follow the protocol of the destination state,” said Prasad, adding those coming to UP will have to go for home quarantine. Anyone coming to UP for two days along with return ticket, he will be spared quarantine on production of return ticket, he said. Prasad also said emergency services have started in over 2,500 private hospitals in the state.

23-05-2020||Patna||Centre nudges Bihar to scale up Covid-19 testing as number of cases rise||The Centre has decided to provide additional testing equipment to Bihar in an effort to scale up their testing for coronavirus as the number of infections in the state grew by an average 13% every day in the last one week, officials said Saturday.An empowered group of officers (EG-2), created by the Central government to implement Covid-19 containment measures in the country, has recommended strengthening testing capability at the ICMR-Rajendra Memorial Research Institute of Medical Sciences (RMRIMS) in Patna.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageIt cleared the decks for equipping the RMRIMS with a ‘Cobas 6800’, a high-throughput instrument for conducting real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT PCR), which is a confirmatory test for Covid-19. The instrument will be dispatched from ICMR-Bangalore in a couple of days.“The instrument will allow the RMRIMS to test 1,000 samples a day. It is likely to be dispatched in a couple of days from ICMR-Bangalore,” said CK Mishra, secretary, ministry of environment, forest and climate change, also the head of the Centre’s EG-2 on Covid-19. This group looks after medical aspects like testing, hospital preparedness and critical care. The Central government has created 11 empowered groups of officers for Covid-19 management.“We have also sent 22 TrueNat machines to Bihar, while also facilitating ICMR’s approval to a private testing lab in Patna for conducting RT PCR tests. With these, Bihar will be able to selectively test little more samples,” said Mishra.He said the high positivity of cases to samples tested in Bihar was little worrying. Bihar’s positivity of cases was around 12% as compared to the national average of 5%. However, with increased testing and better contact tracing, the state can do well to contain the spread of the virus, Mishra added.“In the last one week, (May 15-May 21), the number of new infections has grown by an average 13% every day,” said Bihar’s principal secretary, health, Uday Singh Kumawat.Bihar’s case doubling period was eight days (as on May 19) against the national average of 13.28 days. It was testing 466 out of every 1 million people, as of May 21.Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar has already asked his officers to ramp testing from an average 2,000 to 10,000 per day. The state had tested a total of 2,920 samples on Thursday after eight health facilities in districts were recently equipped with TrueNat and CB-NAAT machines.Seventeen out of every 1 million people have now tested positive for the virus in the state, with the migrants accounting for almost 59% of the state’s total Covid-19 cases, which was 2,263 on Saturday afternoon. Eleven people infected by the virus have died so far.As of now, the RMRIMS has a capacity to test 800 to 1,000 samples a day.“Once we get the Cobas 6800 instrument, we will be able to test 1,800 samples in a day,” said its director, Pradeep Das.“The instrument requires negative-pressure room (Airborne Infection Isolation Rooms, which help maintain clean conditions). We are talking to different air-conditioning firms and it may take us a week or so to have the system in place,” said Das.Meanwhile, the ICMR has given its nod to the Sen Diagnostics Pvt Ltd in Patna to conduct RT PCR tests. This is in addition to the Dr Lal Path Labs in Patna and the Path Kind Diagnostics Pvt Ltd in Patna and Muzaffarpur.“We are arranging to have the system functional soon after creating a separate kiosk for collection of swab samples. We will conduct the confirmatory test for Rs 3,000,” said Dr Sandeep Sen, director of the Sen Disgnostics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/centre-nudges-bihar-to-scale-up-covid-19-testing-as-number-of-cases-rise/story-G3YXQBe40eVQWMFcJpkB4K.html

23-05-2020||Mumbai||60% Olive Ridley turtle hatchlings in Maharashtra did not survive in 2019-20||Only two-fifths of all Olive Ridley turtle hatchlings made their way to the sea in Maharashtra between 2019 and 2020.According to data collated from different forest ranges by the state mangrove cell and Maharashtra Mangrove Foundation on World Turtle Day (May 23), 12,149 hatchlings survived from 27,254 eggs during 2019-20, accounting for a survival rate of 44.5%.In 2018-19, the survival rate was 54.4%, with 12,601 hatchlings that made it to sea from 23,131 eggs.Sporadic nesting of turtles is reported from an average of 33 sandy beaches across three districts in Konkan – Raigad, Ratnagiri, and Sindhudurg. While Sindhudurg witnessed a marked improvement in survival rate, from 47.3% in 2018-19 to 74.3% in 2019-20, Ratnagiri observed a decline to 34% in 2019-20 against 57.4% in 2018-19. Raigad also witnessed a drop from 65.4% to 52.2% over two years.“We must realise that this is preliminary information, and there might be several data gaps since this annual statistical collation from three districts is a relatively new process. We need to study the pattern for at least 10 years to come up with exact trends,” said Virendra Tiwari, additional principal chief conservator of forest (mangrove cell).Olive Ridley sea turtles are found in warm tropical currents of the Indian and Pacific oceans. A schedule I species under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, they travel thousands of kilometres in the ocean, with only the females returning to their original nesting sites within a minimum of two years, to lay eggs. After a 50 to 60-day incubation period, juvenile turtles break the eggshell, dig through the sand, and crawl to the sea. While females return to their place of birth, males never return to land.“Female turtles use geomagnetic imprinting [navigating to their geographic area of origin using magnetic field] and olfactory [relating to the sense of smell] cues to find their natal areas,” said Harshal Karve, marine biologist, Mangrove Foundation.Changes in weather patterns are the main reason for the fall in survival rate, said Mohan Upadhyay, livelihood assistant, Mangrove Foundation. “Firstly, nesting was delayed due to a series of extreme weather events including heavy rain coupled with cyclones in the Arabian Sea, last monsoon. Then the winter season was much warmer than previous years even for coastal districts. Following this, there was a spike in maximum temperatures this year from late February. When temperatures rise, it affects the incubation period, resulting in a lower survival rate,” said Upadhyay.Independent experts, however, said the survival rate does not depend completely on extreme weather factors. “Hatchling survival is affected by rising beach temperature and prolonged rainy days can damage some nests. But proper management and protection for natural nests can address these issues. However, even a 44% survival rate for natural in-situ nests is not bad. Focused conservation can help improve this,” said Basudev Tripathi, senior scientist, Zoological Survey of India and member of International Union for Conservation of Nature. Meanwhile, the Mangrove Foundation has commissioned a research study to assess the incubation temperature of nests along the Maharashtra coast. The project is being undertaken by a PhD scholar from the Wildlife Institute of India, Dehradun. “Atmospheric temperature plays a major role in developing and determining the sex of baby turtles. Temperature data loggers have been deployed at various turtle nesting sites in Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg, and the results will help us understand the nesting ecology,” said Karve.A similar study undertaken by the Mangrove Foundation – comparing nesting data from 2002 to 2006 and 2014 to 2019 – has shown that the peak nesting period had shifted from winter months (December) to early summer months (February-March). “Many nests which are now being laid along the Maharashtra coast during the February-March period hatch out in the summer months of April-May when the ambient and sand temperatures tend to be on the higher side [above 32 degrees Celsius], which may lead most of the turtle hatchling to be females. Also, higher nest temperature data suggests a lower survival rate for hatchlings,” said Tiwari. “We are therefore developing solutions to ensure that the hatchlings are protected from higher temperatures through the use of sheds, regular monitoring, and litter-free turtle nesting habitats.”Using some of the results, this year green sheds were installed to cover nesting sites from direct sunlight and high temperatures. “However, the Covid-19 lockdown made material transport difficult,” said Upadhyay.The state forest department, with local NGO Sahayadri Nisarg Mitra, has been educating local communities on sea turtle conservation. “From locating nesting sites, excavation, relocation of eggs, fencing nets, and preventing poaching and flooding, around two persons per nesting site have been trained by us. Now, using a format provided by us, the volunteers have begun collating all information about the entire process from nesting to hatching,” said Karve.To further boost turtle conservation, earlier this month the forest department introduced an honourarium of ₹15.63 lakh to locals in Ratnagiri, while the Sindhudurg district administration provided ₹6lakh to ₹8 lakh annually under its conservation management plan. The Union environment ministry is also in the process of finalising the National Marine Turtle Conservation Policy soon, said officials. “It is in the final stages. State-specific models like Odisha and Maharashtra will help achieve a long-term conservation protocol that can be replicated across other states,” said a senior ministry official.15 CASES OF MARINE ANIMAL STRANDING INCIDENTS ALONG MUMBAI COAST IN 2019On World Turtle Day, the state mangrove cell released data on marine mammal stranding incidents in 2019 along the Mumbai coast. While 10 Olive Ridley turtles and one Hawksbill turtle were stranded, two were treated and released back to the sea with the others succumbing to their injuries and infections.

Police on high alert,” the it added.The announcement came after protests in several parts of Kolkata and neighbouring districts over power and water crisis even three days after cyclone ‘Amphan’ hit the state.Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has urged people to have patience as the administration was working tirelessly to restore normalcy.Cyclone ‘Amphan’ has claimed 86 lives in the state and caused havoc in at least 14 districts, mainly in South 24 Parganas, Kolkata, North 24 Parganas and East Midnapore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/west-bengal-seeks-army-s-help-to-restore-essential-services-hit-by-cyclone-amphan/story-HsPMU8GPpilTskE9k6TfbL.html
23-05-2020||Kolkata||Cyclone Amphan: Protests across Kolkata as power, water crisis continues||Protests continued in several areas of Kolkata on Saturday as parts of the metropolis remained without water and power since cyclone Amphan ravaged the city.From Behala in the south to Belgharia in the north, armed with placards, people blocked roads with empty buckets and utensils.Protests were also reported from Sapuipara and Pallishree areas in Jadavpur, Garfa, besides Narkeldanga and Telangabagan.The protesters, many of whom were women, said they are under extreme hardship as there was no electricity and water for the past three days and repeated calls to power utilities CESC and WBSEDCL went unanswered.They said that due to the power cut they cannot pumpwater from the supply lines to the tanks of their respective houses, leading to a dire situation amid the rising mercury.While some of the protesters blamed the lack of preparedness on the part of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) despite repeated warnings of the severity of the cyclone by the weather office, many pointed fingers at the response of the power utilities to the crisis.“There has been no word from CESC on when the power will be restored. A tree, which fell on the transformer in our area, was not removed. The KMC staff said they don’t have the tools, while CESC said they can start work only after the tree is removed. We are living in inhuman conditions,” a middle-aged man from Jadavpur said.Many others said they cannot continue with work from home due to the lack of power and internet connectivity.“We are forced to buy mineral water cans at higher prices. Forget about working from home, we can’t even take baths and do other normal things,” said a woman, who is in her 20s, in the Garfa area.Police had to chase away protesters at Dopariya in Ghola area off Kalyani Expressway as the blockade continued for over an hour.Officials said locals refused to lift the blockade till power lines were restored in the area, following which police had to step in.With uprooted trees blocking several arterial roads, police faced a tough time to keep the city moving as the blockades continued.A police officer said protesters in some areas went back to their homes after persuasions and assurances.Officials of the two power utilities said with thousands of trees uprooted across the city, it was taking time for restoration of electricity.Power was being restored in phases, they said.Similar protests were held on Friday as well in several areas, which people said have turned into islands as connectivity -- power, water, internet, mobile network and cable television -- remained severed following the cyclone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/cyclone-amphan-protests-across-kolkata-as-power-water-crisis-continues/story-jAonAwzmkg8Qis77qIAGJK.html

It can lead to the spread of disease, as the crowd is huge and there is no control over it.”Interestingly most of the containment zones declared by the Pune municipal corporation (PMC) like Parvati Darshan area, Gultekadi, some parts of Sahakarnagar and Dhankawadi are all nearby the Satara Road.None of the policemen or government officials are found taking actions on this illegal market going on in the dark. And from May 22 till May 31 Pune police have declared a curfew from 7pm to 7am in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/why-civic-admin-police-clueless-about-this-buzzing-morning-market/story-SNcCViYRF4dMqNnmQP9HMK.html

A total of seven people have donated their plasma at the KGMU so far, the official said, adding that they have been kept in a plasma bank and can be used anytime for the next one year. “Yash Thakur, the recovered patient, donated his plasma on Friday night… His blood group is O positive which is quite rare,” the head of the KGMU blood transfusion medicine department Tulika Chandra said on Saturday. There are 17 coronavirus patients admitted in the KGMU including two women but none of them require plasma therapy. So, the KGMU administration has decided that serious patients admitted in hospitals in other districts, who require plasma therapy, should be brought here, Chandra said. Plasma therapy trials are currently underway at the KGMU. On April 27, a 58-year-old doctor from Orai in Jalaun district became the first recipient of plasma therapy and the donor was the woman doctor from Canada, the first COVID-19 patient admitted to KGMU. However, the patient passed away after suffering a heart attack on May 9. The KGMU had later said that two corona reports of the deceased were negative. Convalescent Plasma Therapy is an experimental procedure for treating COVID-19 patients. In this treatment, plasma, a blood component, from a cured patient is transfused to a critically ill coronavirus patient. The blood of a person who has recovered from COVID-19 develops antibodies to fight the virus. This therapy uses the antibodies from the blood of a cured patient to treat another critical patient. The Union health ministry, however, has advised against considering the therapy to be regular treatment for coronavirus, adding it should be used for research and trial purposes till there is a robust scientific evidence to support its efficacy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/21-year-old-recovered-covid-19-patient-donates-plasma-at-up-s-kgmu/story-htl4fO1k2ZyIzdmKWdWzPI.html
23-05-2020||Delhi||Covid-19 toll in Delhi rises to 231; 591 new cases||The novel coronavirus death toll in Delhi rose to 231 on Saturday, while the number of infections climbed to 12,910 with 591 new cases, authorities said. This is the fifth consecutive day when 500 or more new cases of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were recorded in Delhi. It registered the highest spike on Friday with 660 new cases. In a bulletin issued on Saturday, the Health Department said the death toll due to the pandemic had risen to 231 and the total number of cases mounted to 12,910 after 591 more people tested positive. It, however, added the cumulative death figures referred to fatalities where the primary cause of death was found to be COVID-19, as per the report of the Death Audit Committee on the basis of case sheets received from various hospitals. On Friday, the number of cases were 12,319, including 208 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/covid-19-toll-in-delhi-rises-to-231-591-new-cases/story-6rFLiRcATnggK9gplFYE1I.html
23-05-2020||Delhi||Covid-19: Delhi records 591 cases and 23 deaths on Saturday||Delhi recorded 23 more deaths due to Covid-19 on Saturday, taking the death toll from viral infections in the city to 231, according to the daily official health bulletin. Of the total deaths, 158 were recorded in the past 12 days, after a three-member death audit committee started clearing the backlog of deaths that hadn’t been added to the cumulative report.An order issued by Delhi chief secretary Vijay Dev on May 10 had directed all designated Covid-19 hospitals to report deaths by 5pm each day to ensure timely reporting. This was done after a discrepancy was detected between cumulative data and deaths recorded at the hospitals.The additional deaths put the mortality rate due to Covid-19 in Delhi at almost 1.8%, up from 1% recorded on May 11, before the pending deaths were added to the bulletin. The mortality rate is still lower than the national average of almost 3%.On Saturday, Delhi recorded 591 new infections, taking the total to 12,910. The number of cases have been steadily increasingly in May, with the city recording more than 500 cases a day for the past five days.Even as Delhi is recording a high number of cases, the doubling rate – an indicator of the pace of spread of infections -- has gone up to almost 15 days. “We will be comfortable when the doubling rate goes up to 20 days,” Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain had earlier told a news briefing.Of the 6,412 people still with the infection, 1,886 with severe symptoms were admitted to designated Covid-19 hospitals. A total of 184 people are in intensive care units and 27 people are on ventilators.“The numbers would certainly go up now that the lockdown has been eased. There are so many asymptomatic cases, how will you stop the infections? The numbers would increase further as migrant workers reach their home towns, and after the two-week incubation,” said Shobha Broor, former head of the department of microbiology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS). “However, what the numbers would look like, I do not know. None of the mathematical models have so far been able to predict the rise in cases accurately. Plus, we say 80% of cases are asymptomatic but we haven’t really done any serological studies to estimate the burden of the disease so far. We have to do antibody tests in selected cohorts, both in high burden and low burden areas, to find out the number of asymptomatic cases,” said Broor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/covid-19-delhi-records-591-cases-and-23-deaths-on-saturday/story-zACmMkqj4cm3InU5TlLnlL.html
23-05-2020||Chandigarh||Vikramaditya Singh, hoteliers meet CM, demand financial package to cover losses due to COVID-19||Shimla (rural) legislator Vikramaditya Singh accompanied by a three-member delegation of the Himachal Pradesh’s hotel and tourism industry met chief minister Jai Ram Thakur and demanded a financial package as the industry had taken a setback during the global coronavirus pandemic. Singh said that for the last three months tourism units had not been able to generate any revenue and can no longer continue to pay fixed costs such as salaries, electricity and water charges and other taxes. He told the CM that￼ immediate relief was required to ensure the survival of the tourism industry in Himachal, which had already missed the peak season. Shimla hotel and restaurant association president Sanjay Sood said if relief was not provided immediately then hotels will be forced to close and several businesses indirectly associated with tourism will suffer irreparable loss leading to mass unemployment in the state.The delegation has demanded that a financial package be given to all hotels to cover business losses incurred during lockdown period by way of interest-free loans from the State Cooperative Bank and other state owned banks, waiver of interest on existing term loans and cash credit (CC) limits availed from different banks and extension of existing term loans and CC limit with no requirement of fresh and additional collaterals. No electricity and water charges should be taken from hotels, which have been closed since lockdown, the delegation demanded.“All fixed taxes, cess and license fees should be waived for the lockdown period. The government should pay minimum wage to all hotel employees during the lockdown,” they told the CM. Around 50,000 employees are working in tourism units of the private and government sector. “The total amount will be less than 50 crore per month, which should be paid by way of direct transfer to all employees of tourism units. Goods and services tax (GST) should be reduced to 9% for two years after the lockdown opens to encourage revival of tourism in HP. Hotels should be allowed to charge 9% as ‘Covid - 19 surcharge’ to bills of visiting customers to make up for drop in sale during the lockdown,” they said. ‘EXPEDITE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS’ “Completion of tourism-linked infrastructure such as helipads, National highways (NH), state highways and link roads should be expedited,” they suggested. “A special budget should be announced for marketing Himachal as a safe travel destination to revive tourism,” the delegation said.The CM assured them that the government will soon announce all possible relief for the survival and revival of tourism industry in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/vikramaditya-singh-hoteliers-meet-cm-demand-financial-package-to-cover-losses-due-to-covid-19/story-a1C5RT4rPqZTfm6OMIdAWJ.html
23-05-2020||Kolkata||No incident of Sunderbans tigers straying into human habitat during cyclone Amphan: Official||The fencing that separates the Sunderbans Tiger Reserve from the human habitation was damaged in at least three places as cyclone Amphan has ravaged West Bengal but there was no incident of big cats straying into localities, a top forest department official said.The control rooms in Gosaba in South 24 Parganas district and Salt Lake near here have not received any incident of tigers or other wild animals straying into adjacent villages in the past three days, Chief Wildlife Warden Ravikant Sinha told PTI.“There was no report of animal casualty in the core forest area or nearby villages during the cyclone,” he said.Sinha said parts of the fencing were damaged in Kultali, Bidya, Sajnekhali areas and these affected points are being repaired on an urgent basis by field workers of the forest department.Lakhs of people were rendered homeless as the cyclone cut a path of destruction through half a dozen districts of West Bengal, including Kolkata, on Wednesday night, blowing away shanties, uprooting thousands of trees besides swamping low-lying areas.The death toll due to the natural calamity has risen to 85 in the state.Sinha said the Jharkhali camp, a gateway to the Sunderbans, a vast mangrove forest, was partially affected due to the cyclone, and the sluice gate, which regulates water flow to the camp from nearby creeks, has already been repaired.Asked about the image of the carcass of a tiger being circulated on social media, Sinha said, “It was not true. All the animals in different zoos and forests including the Sunderbans are safe.” According to the latest tiger-census, the number of big cats in the Sunderbans Reserve Forest has increased to 96 from the previous estimate of 88.“Post-Amphan, the number will remain the same,” he said.A fawn was born at the Jharkhali Deer Park on the day of storm and this is good news, he said.Meanwhile, Alipore Zoo director Asis Samanta said a total of 35 trees were uprooted in the zoo during the cyclone and the work are being carried out at war footing to clear the area.Amid the coronavirus outbreak, the zoo remains closed since March 17.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/no-incident-of-sunderbans-tigers-straying-into-human-habitat-during-cyclone-amphan-official/story-Zfciffxg1yzTd4BXJeTxFJ.html
23-05-2020||Kolkata||Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh stopped from visiting cyclone-affected areas||West Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh was on Saturday stopped by police from visiting the cyclone-ravaged areas of the South 24 Parganas district, triggering a war of words between the saffron party and the ruling TMC. Ghosh was on his way to Canning and Basanti, two of the many areas of the district affected by cyclone Amphan, to distribute relief materials. His car was stopped by the police at Dhalai bridge near Garia area of the district. “I don’t know why I have been stopped from visiting the cyclone-affected areas. The TMC leaders are visiting these places and distributing relief materials. The police is not stopping them. The rule only changes for the BJP leaders,” Ghosh said. His comment came after Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced an advance assistance of Rs 1,000 crore for the cyclone-hit state and an ex-gratia of Rs 2 lakh to the families of each of those killed and Rs 50,000 for the injured. Ghosh threatened to organise a sit-in, if he was not allowed to go to the affected areas. “If the state government wants to pursue relief politics, they should get ready for a befitting reply from our workers,” he said. The BJP workers accompanying Ghosh had a mild scuffle with the police personnel, and they pushed the men in uniform to pave the way for the vehicle of the party’s state president. When contacted, the police declined to comment. Kolkata Mayor and state minister Firhad Hakim wondered why the state BJP was keen on doing politics over the distribution of relief materials. Ghosh had on Friday demanded that the assistance should be credited to the bank accounts of the people, affected by cyclone Amphan, to avoid siphoning of money.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/bengal-bjp-president-dilip-ghosh-stopped-from-visiting-cyclone-affected-areas/story-JBNua3cV3zdO09ExI1ld0M.html
23-05-2020||Delhi||No-show at DU amid lockdown renders standalone street food vendors jobless||Admission season in Delhi University means brisk business for the many vendors that line up North Campus. These hole-in-the-wall establishments serve tea, coffee, snacks and other knick-knacks at pocket-friendly rates, making them a hit with students. But a no-go for colleges, as well as extended lockdowns have rendered them out of business. The otherwise bustling lanes of the campus lie barren, painting a picture of gloom. Sudama Prasad of Sudama Tea Stall near Ramjas College had to shift from his accommodation in Kamla Nagar to Sonia Vihar to save rent. He used to employ four boys at his stall, all of whom he sent back with two months’ advance payment. He is sceptical of reopening, lest anyone complains about him. “Daily ₹ 1,500 kamaa lete the. Koi madad nahi mili hai kisi se. Dukaan khol bhi le toh koi baccha complaint bhi kar sakta hai isliye abhi toh soch bhi nahi raha hoon. 28 saal ho gaye yahaan par kabhi aisi majboori nahi dekhi,” he says. With no money coming in and expenses to take care of, many have been forced to go back to their villages. Sarfuddin, who used to manage Saroj Juice Hut near Arts Faculty, has gone back to his village in Kaiserganj, Uttar Pradesh. The shop owner had called him back, but he feels that it’s a long way before business picks up pace. “Jiska dhanda-paani bandh ho jaaye uska guzaara kaise chalega. Maalik ka phone aaya tha ki vaapis aa jaao, lekin mujhe nahi lagta kaam raftaar pakdega kyuki zyada dikkat toh khaane-peene mein hi aa rahi hai,” he says. The shop would make a sale of around ₹ 5,000 every day and employed four people. Manchanda Snacks was established in 1997 by Satish Manchanda outside the old Law Faculty building, and now his son, Vinay, manages the shop. He had employed two people to help man the shop, both of whom left for their homes. “We would make ₹ 6,000- ₹ 7,000 per day easily because this used to be peak time for us. Now we are not sure of the future, at least till June,” he says, adding, “The losses are manifold. We would also need to do something about the expired stock at the shop once we reopen, so that’s also a financial loss we will have to incur,” says Vinay.Read: DU open book mode exams: Over 170 teachers ask VC to not hold online exams, say will compromise sanctitySome stall owners have found ways to continue business, albeit not without losses. “The shop is closed. We are taking orders at home, and delivering them on our own. There are only a handful of orders which we make in our kitchen. Earlier we would sell 100-150 plates of maggi, making a sale of upto ₹ 10,000 per day. Hopefully, after June 1, we will get some clarity to reopen,” says Sandeep Kataria of Tom Uncle Maggi Point, located near Ramjas College.Appealing to the government to let the stalls ply during specific hours, Sunil Kashyap, says, “I would request the government to let us reopen our stalls with a time limit. I would make ₹ 15,000-₹. 20,000 a month but it’s all gone now. Ek yehi kaam kiya hai poori zindagi aur yehi kaam aata hai. Naya kaam lagaane ka matlab hai ki jo thodi bahut savings hain, usse bhi risk karna,” says Kashyap who used to sell bread pakoras and aloo tikkis at his stall in Kamla Nagar market. Nostalgia and memories surround these shops, and the owners each have tales galore of their own to share. An evening of exchanging notes over sweet, milky tea at Sudama bhaiyya, or a birthday treat of noodles and chilled soft drinks at Tom Uncle — these shops have been an intrinsic part of the students’ journeys. With renewed practices and a little push from the authorities, one can only hope to see this sight again.Interact with Etti Bali @TheBalinianFollow @htcity for more||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/no-show-at-du-amid-lockdown-renders-standalone-street-food-vendors-jobless/story-FZsH02JkQc2I5EgQurB2TO.html

23-05-2020||Kolkata||Cyclone Amphan: Death toll in Bengal reaches 85, protests over failure to restore normalcy||The death toll due to Cyclone Amphan in West Bengal has risen to 85, as angry Kolkatans resorted to protest and road blockades in various parts of the city over the administration’s failure to restore normalcy even after three days. With normal life thrown out of gear by the region’s worst weather disasters, the authorities scrambled in various parts of the state to restore normalcy. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is likely to visit Cyclone Amphan hit South 24 Parganas district on Saturday and take stock of the situation. Lakhs of people were rendered homeless as Cyclone Amphan cut a path of destruction through half-a-dozen districts of the state on Wednesday, flattening houses, uprooting thousands of trees and swamping low-lying areas. According to official sources, around 1.5 crore people of the state have been directly affected and more than 10 lakh houses destroyed due to the cyclone. Although electricity and mobile connection were restored in some parts of Kolkata, and North and South 24 Parganas districts, many areas continued to remain in darkness as power poles had been blown away and communication lines snapped. Several roads and houses in Kolkata, Howrah, and North and South 24 Parganas districts continue to remain waterlogged, as hapless citizens came out on the streets against the administration’s “apathy and ineffectiveness”. People in various parts of Kolkata staged protests and blockades since Friday night demanding immediate resumption of power and water supply, three days after Amphan ravaged the state. Firhad Hakim, chairman of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation board of administrators, assured the people that normalcy would be restored in a week, as government officials were working round the clock to improve the situation. “More than 5,000 trees have been uprooted. We have already cleared several roads,” Hakim said. “We are in touch with the private power supply provider and had asked them to restore supply as early as possible.” In Kakdwip area of South 24 Parganas district, people complained that they were not given enough tarpaulin sheets to cover the roofs of houses damaged by the cyclone. In Hingalganj block of North 24 Parganas, people claimed they were running out of food, as shops in the vicinity were yet to lift shutters in the aftermath of the calamity. “The entire area is underwater and we are out of food for the last three days. We are yet to get any relief,” said Geeta Mahali, a resident of the area. Several relief camps have come up in the districts, where hapless people have queued up for two squares of meal and shelter after their homes being either blown or washed away. Teams of the National Disaster Response Force and the State Disaster Relief Force have been working on a war-footing to clear the roads blocked by the uprooted trees. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had flew down to Kolkata on Friday and undertook an aerial survey of the cyclone-hit areas along with Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. Lauding the efforts of the state government in combating the crisis, Modi announced an advance assistance of Rs 1,000 crore for the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/cyclone-amphan-death-toll-in-bengal-reaches-85-protests-over-failure-to-restore-normalcy/story-EcBq8zQHs1eQRPVbLDOb8M.html

While the state has currently over 2.9 lakh people observing home or institutional quarantine, the number of samples tested so far is only 42,000.According to state health department’s May 21 bulletin, the number of people in quarantine centres rose by nearly seven times from 10,304 to 71,123 and those staying in home quarantine increased by almost double from 1.11 lakh to over 2.19 lakh in last 10 days.“The steep growth in number of quarantined people is due to migrant workers coming in hoards in state,” said a senior health department’s official.These workers, after their arrival in the state, are being sent to institutional quarantine or home quarantine. Besides district level quarantine centres, such facilities have been set up at school buildings and other government buildings at village and block levels.The bulletin also mentioned that of the 303 positive cases detected till May 21 (Friday), 147 cases were found in migrant workers who returned to Jharkhand after May 5.“The influx of people from outside the state will definitely increase the positive cases here. It has been noticed that many workers, who were tested positive, had arrived from red zones like Mumbai and Surat. It’s, therefore, necessary to keep all those coming from these locations in institutional quarantine,” said Dr A K Singh, state president of Indian Medical Association (IMA).“But for effective containment of the disease, we have to escalate sample testing and keep a strict monitoring on movement of people observing isolation. It has been reported that many workers put in quarantine centres at village schools came out freely without a check,” added Singh.The Covid-19 pandemic has been spreading its tentacles after the return of migrant workers in Jharkhand as the state’s 21 of 24 districts have come under its grip.The worst-affected districts are Garhwa, Hazaribag, Giridih and Koderma from where 47, 33, 16 and 16 cases respectively had been reported till May 21.Ranchi district, which reported the state’s first case on March 31, has alone witnessed 112 positive cases, including two confirmed cases in migrant workers so far. However, it saw swift recovery of patients as 91 have been cured and discharged.While, the disease seven days growth rate in the state stood at 5.84% against the national average of 5.36%, the doubling period is 12.20 days against the national average of 13.28 days. Jharkhand’s recovery rate is, however, better than the national average which is 40.30% against state’s 42.72%.BoxDate. People in IQ.

Since the first lockdown, our employees and the company has been working towards donating rations early in the lockdown period to various people in need, then shifting to providing cooked meals to those in various shelters, where the first batch was in Bhokharewadi in Hinjewadi phase II, thus as and when requested, we were providing help,” said Pravin Kulkarni, vice president, and development centre head, Infosys Pune.According to Kulkarni, Infosys has also given 20 ventilators to civil hospitals and municipal hospitals. We have also donated personal protective equipment (PPE) to doctors, hospitals, and police, giving santisers and masks.“Most of the women came forward to take the set of reusable cotton masks. This slum has 50,000 people living in congested small homes, mostly labourers who work in and around timber market and it was in the main peth area,” said Dattatreya Pandit, member of the CSR team, who was present for the donation drive. “This is just the beginning, we also plan to give them either soaps or sanitisers which are limited resources for them next which is important and plan to educate them on hand hygiene,” added Pandit.Morale confirmed this adoption and said, his team met the Infosys team when they came to help Pune police with 2,000 masks and while discussing with them, it was appealed to them to help adopt a slum, which has more than 300 positive cases and lacks basic amenities.“We had given them four slums that we have identified like Patil estate, Tadiwala road, Gadital and Lohiyanagar. This is the first IT company to come forward and adopt a slum and we hope others will follow soon to help break the chain and prevent Covid-19 from spreading further.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/infosys-adopts-covid-hit-slum-donates-10-000-masks/story-WLU89HbLfZISimy6a7bawI.html
23-05-2020||Pune||Pune dog lovers rescue pets abandoned due to coronavirus fears||Dog lovers in Maharashtra’s Pune city have come to the rescue of pets, especially dogs of foreign breeds, who have been abandoned by their owners over misplaced fears of contracting coronavirus infection from them.Over 50 volunteers from Animal Adoption and Rescue Team (AART) have been patrolling the streets of Pune, looking to rescue abandoned pets and feeding strays during the Covid-19 lockdown.“Since the lockdown was imposed, we have seen a rise in cases of dog owners abandoning their pets, especially those of imported breeds such as Dobermans, Labradors and German Shepherds,” said Ajay Pujar, one of the volunteers.The organisation had so far rescued over 40 such dogs from different parts of the city and sent them to shelter homes in the outskirts of Pune, he said. Many dog owners were abandoning their pets over misplaced fears and misconceptions that coronavirus infection was transmitted from animals, he said.“Another reason for this phenomenon is that several pet owners, including students, have left the city because of the pandemic, leaving the animals behind,” he added.After the lockdown was imposed, the organisation had received a call from a housing society, where some students had returned to their hometowns, leaving their two dogs locked in their flat.“We rescued the dogs who were left behind without any food or means to survive,” he said.Abandoning pets had become a common phenomenon during the health crisis, said Vineeta Tandon, who heads Animal Rescue Trust. “As abandoning pets is a crime, dog owners don’t call shelter homes directly and instead leave these canines tied to gates of dog shelters or abandon them in areas where they know strays are fed regularly,” she said.The health ministry has clarified that coronavirus cannot be transmitted from dogs and cats to humans, said Tandon, who runs a shelter home in Kharadi area. The organisation has so far rescued dogs of 23 foreign breeds since the lockdown, she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-dog-lovers-rescue-pets-abandoned-due-to-coronavirus-fears/story-C7nebaj6IR2lB8Wi6VwRrO.html
23-05-2020||Lucknow||Covid-19 fallout: Lower, middle-income families head home after job cuts||Besides daily wagers, security guards, drivers, waiters, office boys, cooks, call centre workers, startup employees and others are also quitting cities and heading home due to uncertainty about jobs and practically no income.However, these workers are pooling money to hire vehicles.Rajesh Kashyap, who worked as a salesman in a multi-brand garment retail outlet in Lakshminagar of east Delhi hired a van with his cousins for Rs 60,000 to return home to Gorakhpur. “I earned Rs 18,000 monthly before lockdown was imposed. I have not received any salary in the lockdown. I think it will take a while for me to get my job back so I decided to head home,” Rajesh said.He was returning home with his wife and two children, cousins and their families. There were 14 people in the van. “My cousins and I pooled in 20,000 each to hire this vehicle. There was no option but to return home,” he added.The group left Delhi in the wee hours of Saturday and reached Gorakhpur by 7 pm.More than 3,000 such vehicles crossed the toll booth in the past six weeks, almost all of them carrying families heading home. “Most traveller vans are returning from Delhi, Gurugram and Noida. A few are also returning from places in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Gujarat,” said an employee at the toll booth on Lucknow-Agra Expressway on the outskirts of Lucknow.Sudhakar Yadav, worker in a diamond polishing unit in Surat, Gujarat entered Lucknow via the same toll booth on Sunday. He was accompanied by six other workers of the same unit travelling in an SUV. “We were all very worried about the situation and decided to return home. We have all paid Rs 1 lakh to hire this vehicle till our house in Jaunpur district,” Yadav said.A machine operator at the unit, Yadav was paid Rs 22,000 monthly. The salary was reduced to half in March when the lockdown was imposed and he was not paid in April.A few desperate people, mostly youngsters, even called their relatives to take them home. Dileep Mandal of Bihar drove up to Delhi in his car to bring back his son and his friend from Gurugram. Mandal’s son was employed with a start-up tech firm in Gurugram that collapsed in the lockdown.Economic experts believe that close to 10 million people from east UP and Bihar are employed in Delhi NCR who will have to face difficult times ahead. “More than half of these people will lose their jobs in coming days if proper financial aid is not provided. In such conditions they will be forced to return home creating a vacuum of skilled labour,” said Ramesh Shirodker, a Mumbai-based economist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/covid-19-fallout-workers-from-lower-and-middle-income-groups-also-head-home/story-O4MKKPPObRvHDzFQLnmBKK.html

23-05-2020||Delhi||Delhi to get 2,000 oxygen concentrators, may change norms to buy more PPEs||Anticipating the need for more oxygen than ventilators to treat patients of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), the Delhi government has set out to procure 2,000 oxygen concentrators. An oxygen concentrator is a device that removes nitrogen from the ambient air to enrich it with about 93% concentrated oxygen for patients in need of respiratory support, with a mask, whereas a ventilator is a machine that pumps air in and out of the lungs through a tube. In India, only 0.45% of Covid-19 patients are still on ventilators, while 2.94% of them are on oxygen support, according to data from the union health ministry. The data also goes to show that 0.4% of Delhi’s patients are on ventilators but does not elaborate upon how many are on oxygen support.A senior official from Delhi’s health department said on condition of anonymity, “After treating so many Covid-19 patients, we’ve realised that most of them do not need ventilators. Oxygen support is good enough to improve their respiratory rate and oxygen concentration. Therefore, the Delhi government has decided to purchase oxygen concentrators.” The Delhi government is preparing for a worst-case scenario of 30,000 active cases simultaneously. There are 5,720 active cases in Delhi as on May 20, according to Delhi government data.The official quoted above said that oxygen concentrators would not only be used within hospitals where there aren’t any gas pipelines but also in hotels or dharamshalas where Covid-19 patients could be treated if the number of cases increases.“There are gas pipelines in most designated Covid-19 hospitals that deliver oxygen to patients. However, some hospitals make use of oxygen cylinders. Oxygen concentrators can be used in these hospitals instead, eliminating the need for oxygen cylinders. Also, if the number of cases goes up, and people start receiving treatment in hotels and dharamshalas, these machines can be transported there,” the senior official said. According to the official, the Delhi government was looking at purchasing 500 ventilators earlier. There are around 306 ventilators in government hospitals and 800 in private hospitals in Delhi as of now.An internal committee of the Delhi government has also started examining the standards for procuring personal protective equipment. According to Delhi government officials, the tender for two lakh PPE kits floated by the Delhi government has failed at least twice within a month as none of the 32 manufacturers could match the quality of the components—coveralls, respirators (N-95), gloves and goggles—that has been prescribed by the health ministry.“The health ministry guidelines have referred to international standards for goggles, masks, coveralls and gloves and several good quality products cannot be purchased if they are not certified according to these standards. Hence, the tenders failed. Now, an internal committee is looking at the products whose quality we can examine and if we find it satisfactory, procure them even if they do not have the requisite certification according to international standards,” another official from the health department said on condition of anonymity.According to the second official, there is no immediate shortage of the kits as “the government-run company HLL Lifecare Limited sent 40 trucks full of PPE kits to the Delhi government earlier this week”. HLL Lifecare Limited had been designated to procure PPE kits through global tenders; however, the company has now stopped procurement, the kits will now be available on Government E-Marketplace for state governments and hospitals to procure.In an earlier shipment last month, from HLL Lifecare Limited, the Delhi government had received only 1,700 goggles and masks (components of the PPE kits) for a total of 15,000 kits, because they were in short supply.“The N-95 respirators were in a short supply in the open market as there were just two of the ten existing Indian manufacturers of the masks in operation during the lockdown. They supplied mostly to HLL. The import from other countries had also gone down. However, the BIS has now allowed companies to get their products certified from approved laboratories outside. Earlier, one of the requirements for a manufacturer was to have a complete in-house testing facility, which usually cost ₹50 lakh to set up and around ₹2 lakh each year to maintain. Now, mostly MSMEs (Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises) make these respirators and cannot afford the testing facility. Several companies have now come forward to make the masks and the shortage should reduce within the week,” Sanjeev Relhan, chairman, Preventive Wear Manufacturers’ Association of India (PWMAI), said.“There is a shortage of goggles, though, as per the standards mentioned by the ministry of health, but there are enough face shields and visors available, which are actually more comfortable to work in, especially for those who wear spectacles. State governments could, perhaps, modify the health ministry’s guidelines. The guidelines for rational use of the kits have helped,” he said.The health ministry guidelines have clearly specified what kind of protective gear has to be worn in what parts of the hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-to-get-2-000-oxygen-concentrators-may-change-norms-to-buy-more-ppes/story-wTfLjdSCBF0FNFQOvEKZPI.html

PATIENT’S SON ALERTED HEALTH AUTHORITIESIt was the patient’s son, a doctor, who alerted district health authorities to his father’s Covid-19 status on Thursday after he tested positive on May 17 following treatment for oral cancer at a private hospital in Mumbai on May 7 and follow-up treatment at the hospital’s Delhi branch on May 16.Dr Narwal said when health authorities visited the patient’s father at their Panchkula home, he claimed that the patient had not visited the family for the last 25 days.Then, even as tracking the patient’s phone location revealed he was in Panchkula, another visit by the health team to his home on Friday proved unfruitful. Only his doctor son was present there.“He is the only one in the family cooperating (with health authorities) and is keen that his father and other family members be quarantined without any further delay,” said Dr Narwal. Meanwhile, district police commissioner Mohit Handa said he had received the copy of the complaint from the health department and that the matter was under consideration. Of the 26 Covid-19 patients in the district so far, 23 have been cured and discharged and one has died even though the second sample tested negative.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/former-bureaucrat-s-son-goes-missing-after-testing-positive-for-covid-19-family-on-the-run-too/story-fEzR72GVDcvfm6JVQxwEuM.html
23-05-2020||Chandigarh||Plans afoot for elevated road linking Chandigarh’s Madhya Marg to Sarangpur||For improved connectivity from Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) to the Sarangpur institutional area and New Chandigarh (Mullanpur), an elevated road connecting Madhya Marg to Sarangpur-Mullanpur four-lane road is in the works.As per the UT administration plan, the road is to be constructed to bypass two major traffic bottlenecks - villages Khuda Jassu and Khuda Lahora - on the route to Sarangpur and New Chandigarh.The elevated road is to start from Khuda Jassu high-level bridge and descend near the Botanical Garden in Sarangpur after crossing the two villages.“The route is crucial for smooth traffic flow to Sarangpur institutional area, where a number of projects are slated to come up, including the extension campuses of PGIMER and Government Multi-Specialty Hospital (GMSH), Sector 16,” said a senior UT official privy to the development.The PGIMER extension will be constructed over 50 acres and house the screening outpatient departments (OPDs), a 400-bed trauma centre and the oncology department. The GMSH-16 affiliate centre is planned to come up on 15 acres in Sarangpur’s Education City. The administration has proposed to convert GMSH into city’s second medical college after Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) in Sector 32. It will have 100 seats.“The elevated road will also help in improving connectivity to New Chandigarh and, through it, to Baddi industrial area in Himachal Pradesh,” the official said.Currently, the road passing through the two villages is narrow and often leads to traffic jams. “With multiple high-ticket projects coming up in Sarangpur and New Chandigarh, the traffic volume to these areas will increase manifold in the coming years. So, need for better road connectivity was felt,” the official added.Significantly, an alternative route connecting Chandigarh to New Chandigarh is already in the works from Dakshin Marg. The administration has initiated the land acquisition process for constructing the road for extending Dakshin Marg to New Chandigarh.CONSULTANT TO BE APPOINTED SOONThe UT engineering department will be appointing a technical consultant for the project shortly. The consultant will conduct a geo-technical study and prepare preliminary drawings of the project, besides cost estimates and project’s timeline. The department has invited applications for the appointment of a consultant.“After the consultant’s report, the cost, plans and drawings of the proposed road will be finalised by the administration. The project plans will also need to be approved by the heritage committee and require environmental clearance,” said the official.SURVEY FOR PGI PEDESTRIAN UNDERPASSThe UT engineering department will also be appointing a technical consultant to prepare a detailed topographical survey, feasibility study, and traffic survey for the construction of the proposed pedestrian subway between PGIMER and Panjab University on the Madhya Marg.The consultant will have to complete the work in 10 days after appointment. They will also prepare a presentation and walk-through, along with 3D views for the proposed subway.Punjab governor and UT administrator VP Singh Badnore had given in-principle approval to the pedestrian subway last year. It is one of the busiest traffic points with heavy pedestrian movement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/plans-afoot-for-elevated-road-linking-chandigarh-s-madhya-marg-to-sarangpur/story-LcwFEZX4zwsM9kx7sUh4QN.html

In a meeting with a delegation of film producers and broadcasters, Thackeray asked officials to identify safe and secluded locations where film and TV shootings can resume after following all health guidelines. He asked the delegation to prepare a plan on how they can restart shooting and other production-related works and the cultural affairs department will study the plan, CM said acknowledging that the TV industry provides livelihood to several people and that he is not in favour of shutting down everything. Representatives of the Indian Broadcasting Foundation, including its chief NP Singh, coordinator Punit Goenka, along with producers Ekta Kapoor and Nitin Vaidya had a meeting with CM via video-conferencing, in which Shiv Sena functionary and actor Aadesh Bandekar was also present.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/maharashtra-cm-asks-cultural-department-to-study-if-shooting-for-tv-shows-can-resume/story-uZDsUomL3E36uGA2lkpj0N.html
23-05-2020||City||Maharashtra government borrowed ₹9,000 crore to pay salaries, pension||With the drastic fall in tax revenue collections amid the pandemic and lockdown, the state government in April had to borrow ₹9,000 crore from the market for its fixed expenditure such as salaries. The state is expected to borrow the same amount in May too.The state needs ₹20,000 crore to pay salaries, pension to its employees, interest on loans, establishment cost and incidental expenditure such as on Covid-19. The lockdown was announced in the last week of March. Against the mandatory recurring expenses of ₹20,000 crore a month, the state has been receiving only 45-50% since March. The expected revenue collection in March dropped by ₹26,100 crore, while it was ₹10,150 crore lower than estimated in April. A similar drop is expected in May too.“Against the annual estimated tax revenue of ₹22,500 crore per month, we received ₹10,261 crore in April and expect ₹11,000 crore in May. The outstanding from the Centre towards the GST compensation is ₹5,040 crore for the past four months and ₹1,280 crore from the tax devolution for April is yet to be received. This forced us to borrow more from the open market last month. The trend is expected to continue for the next three to four months, even if the lockdown is lifted,” said an official from Mantralaya.The official said the annual budgetary estimate for borrowing was ₹56,000 crore, mainly for development works, but the pandemic has forced them to borrow even for salaries and other recurring expenditure.The state has already initiated a cut of 67% on spending on development and social schemes worth about ₹70,000 crore. “There is a huge pendency of GST payback, devolution of Central taxes and grants from the Centre. We have been demanding a package, including the advance of the GST compensation since Maharashtra is the highest tax-paying state. In the absence of adequate revenue receipts, we are ought to tap other sources to meet the mandatory expenditure,” said Shambhuraj Desai, minister of state for finance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/maharashtra-government-borrowed-9-000-crore-to-pay-salaries-pension/story-fEHJSo3Tpdyfv46SGN7N2L.html
23-05-2020||City||Shiv Sena attends Opposition meet called by Congress chief||Mumbai: For the first time after it parted ways with its former ally, the Bharatiya Janata Party, the Shiv Sena on Friday attended a meeting with leaders of national Opposition party, called by the interim president of Congress party, Sonia Gandhi, through video-conferencing. Sena was represented by party chief and Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, in what is considered to be a significant development for the party. A Sena functionary said that Thackeray maintained a balance, as neither slammed the Centre nor did he speak in favour of the Opposition parties. According to a senior Shiv Sena leader, the CM spoke about the state government’s plan to tackle Covid-19 and also took up the migrants’ issue.“Uddhav ji spoke on the measures taken by the Maharashtra government to control the spread of coronavirus. He also spoke about the issue of migrants and the inconvenience they faced with regards to transportation. Apart from this, he also spoke on retrieving the Goods and Services Tax (GST) refund,” the leader, who did not wish to be named, said.After presenting his points, Thackeray later excused himself citing prior engagements.Earlier in January, the Sena had skipped the all-party meet called by Gandhi over the political situation in the country in the wake of the violence in Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) and the protests over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA). Party leaders later clarified that it was due to a “miscommunication”. Two days later, Thackeray’s son Aaditya, who is now a cabinet minister in the Maharashtra government, met Congress leader Rahul Gandhi in New Delhi, which was later termed as a “courtesy” meet.Meanwhile Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar, who had also participated in Friday’s meeting from Mumbai, also said that the Opposition parties are of the view that this is not the time for showing one-upmanship or indulging in politics for personal political gain. This is the time for a collective endeavour to bring India out of this crisis and that’s what the people of India need and demand for, the NCP supremo said.Meanwhile, the Opposition parties have decided to appeal to the Prime Minister Narendra Modi to engage with all political parties, Pawar said.“We have decided to appeal to the @PMOIndia to immediately reach out to, and engage in a dialogue with all political parties in a systematic manner, listen seriously to the suggestions that we have to refrain from using the crisis for personal political gain, activate Parliamentary institutions like standing committees and be genuine in helping the states financially and otherwise,” Pawar said in a series of tweets.“The like-minded political parties are collectively going to raise a 10-point demand to the central government to implement immediately,” Pawar added.The veteran leader also made a few suggestions in the meeting. He said that the state governments are relaxing the conditions of lockdown but factories are not in a position to resume work as workers have migrated to their respective villages. “We need to strategize to bring them [migrant labourers] back. New policies to encourage industrial growth should be incorporated to attract new investment in the states, increase imports, exports and inland shipping, and consultations should be held with industrialists, entrepreneurs and experts,” the veteran leader said.The former Union minister further suggested that right steps need to be taken to gradually restore road transport within the states and for the resumption of air and rail services.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/shiv-sena-attends-opposition-meet-called-by-congress-chief/story-EGqDIbY4HpY34ky9rxwxKJ.html
23-05-2020||City||Army gives final salute to its hero Major Gurdial Singh Jallanwalia||The mortal remains of Major Gurdial Singh Jallanwalia (retd), one of the oldest war veterans in the country who passed away at the age of 102, was consigned to flames on Friday.While politicians and bureaucrates forgot to pay homage, the army’s top command did not fail to salute it’s hero.Wreaths were laid on behalf of chief of the army staff, General Manoj Mukund Naravane, director general artillery, general officer commanding-in-chief of Army Training Command, Shimla, XI Corps Commander general officer commanding and station commander Brig Manesh Arora.His son Harmanderjeet said no one from the administration or the government called the family to pay their respects. Major Jallanwalia, who was to turn 103 in August, was born on August 21, 1917. He had passed out from the Royal Indian Military School, Jalandhar, and joined the Mountain Artillery Training Centre in June 1935. After completing his training, he was posted with the 14 Rajputana Mountain Battery at Abbottabad (now in Pakistan) and transferred to a Survey Troop at Campbellpur (also in Pakistan) in 1940.Jallanwalia had participated in four battles, including World War II. During the second world war in 1944-1945, he was posted in Burma (now Myanmar) and was shot on the lower abdomen by a Japanese soldier. But somehow, the soldier could not fire a second shot and Jallanwalia’s fellow soldier was quick to shoot the enemy.In 1947 and 1948, Jallanwalia led a battle in Jammu and Kashmir region and during the 1965 war, he was posted in Amritsar.After Independence, Jallanwalia participated in operations to check Pakistani infiltration in the Nowshera Sector in 1948. In the 1965 Indo-Pakistan war, he served as a counter-bombardment officer with XI Corps in the Amritsar-Lahore Sector.He finally hung up his boots in 1967. His two sons – Harmanderjeet Singh and Harjinderjeet Singh – served the Indian Army and Indian Air Force, respectively, and were part of the 1999 Kargil conflict.His grandson is also an Army officer. Major Jallanwalia’s father, Risaldaar Duleep Singh, had fought with the erstwhile British India Army in Mesopotamia during World War I.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/army-gives-final-salute-to-its-hero-major-gurdial-singh-jallanwalia/story-adk1gx1sFG0CPXkDFIqhxK.html

The state government, in its notification which has come into effect from Friday, had prohibited airline and train services till May 31. The state may clarify over the matter by Saturday and issue a revised notification on it.“No final decision has been taken yet, but a section of the officials are in favour of allowing the operations.

23-05-2020||Chandigarh||Row over school fees: Private schools of Chandigarh withdraw petition from high court||The private schools on Friday withdrew their petition from the Punjab and Haryana high court that they had filed over the UT administration’s directions barring them from charging fees during the lockdown.The petition was withdrawn after the court observed that since the administration had now allowed them to charge tuition fee, a fresh course of action had arisen, and issues, if any, should be dealt with in a separate petition.President of Independent Schools’ Association HS Mamik said the May 18 order of UT administration on allowing tuition fee only to be charged will also be challenged since the schools were of the view that the UT had no authority to pass such an order.It was on May 13 that the high court had asked UT to consider schools’ plea on withdrawing order of barring them from fee collection amid the lockdown. On May 18, the UT had allowed schools to charge tuition fees but with a rider that no student should be forced.Schools are not satisfied with this order and want to collect other charges too. They raised an argument on this during Friday’s hearing. However, the court asked them to file a fresh plea.There are 77 private schools who have locked horns with the UT administration. The bone of contention between them are two orders from the administration on the fee issue.The March 30 order had directed schools to reschedule the last date of collection of fee and funds for the session 2020-21 to a date at least one month after the reopening of schools. Again on April 7, the UT had asked private schools to not send any messages to parents with regard to deposition of fee.The schools were warned that any violation would lead to withdrawal of recognition. Following this, schools had approached the administration asking it to allow them to collect fees or pay the salaries of staff members. However, the UT in turn asked schools to provide their balance sheets, which most of them did not agree to. Amid the standoff, teachers and other staff members of the schools were not paid any salaries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/private-schools-of-chandigarh-withdraw-petition-from-punjab-and-haryana-high-court-over-issue-of-fee-collection-during-lockdown/story-xpHcnAof9OIxluNvGBLBYK.html

ED’s counsel Hiten Venegaonkar submitted that the special court did not take cognisance of its prosecution complaint on May 6 and it could not have ordered the agency to give the documents to the accused without first taking cognisance of their complaint.Kapoor also moved HC seeking a declaration that his detention in custody from May 6 onwards was illegal, in as much as, the special court could not have remanded him to custody, without first taking cognisance of the prosecution complaint.In pursuance of the first information report (FIR) registered by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on March 7, ED registered an Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR) the next day against Kapoor and others and started investigations under PMLA.Accordingly, ED arrested Kapoor on March 8 and produced him before the special PMLA court. He was initially remanded to ED’s custody till March 11 and thereafter sent to judicial custody.The YES Bank founder is accused of misusing his position as the bank’s CEO for obtaining undue benefits. He allegedly entered into a criminal conspiracy with the Dewan Housing Finance Limited (DHFL) promoters Dheeraj and Kapil Wadhawan for extending financial assistance to DHFL through YES Bank in return for “substantial undue benefits” to himself and his family members through companies held by them.

23-05-2020||City||Devotees offer more wheat to Golden Temple langa||“We have never received such a large quantity of wheat crop earlier from the villagers during the rabi season at Sri Guru Ram Das Langar (community kitchen of Golden Temple) which is witnessing huge heaps of wheat bags offered by the sangat (community) from various parts of Punjab, with the grace of Guru Sahib”. This was observation of one of the regular volunteers who serves the devotees in the langar, considered as the largest community kitchen in the world offering free food round-the-clock daily to the needy people. Amid Covid-19 pandemic when many people have become jobless due to the lockdown, the Golden Temple langar has been feeding a large number of people, including stranded migrant workers.On the other hand, collection of money offered by devotees has witnessed a drastic dip due to lockdown when very few devotees are able to pay obeisance at the holiest Sikh shrine. The dip in collection had worried the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) as a sizeable portion of it is spent on serving langar (free food). However, the unprecedented response given by the devotees in the form of wheat and other grocery items have lessened the SGPC’s worries.“Ever since the harvesting season has ended, tractor-trailers, trucks and other vehicles, loaded with langar items, including wheat, are reaching the kitchen daily from the villages in large numbers,” said Sukhbir Singh, manager of the community kitchen.“Wheat is the most consumed food item in the langar. Last year, around 34,000 quintal wheat flour was consumed in the langar and quantity of wheat grains offered by the sangat during the harvesting season last year was 13,000 quintals. However, nearly 26,000 quintal wheat has been offered by sangat so far this season. And the arrival is going on yet,” said SGPC chief secretary Roop Singh.“Guru Ka Langar is run with the cooperation of sangat. As community kitchens of all gurdwaras are feeding the needy during the lockdown, the sangat is very enthusiastic to contribute to the service of humanity,” he added.Kulbir Singh, granthi of a gurdwara in Dhadiala village of Hoshiarpur, who along with villagers came with 33 quintal wheat, said “In my living memory, residents of my village never brought so much wheat to the Golden Temple. Actually, some youths of my village asked all farmers to devote at least one wheat bag in view of the pandemic”.Captain Tarlok Singh (retd) of village Firoz Singh Wala in Kapurthala district and residents of Chak Allah Baksh village of Mukerian sub-division of Hoshiarpur also said that they have brought wheat and other grocery items for the first time.

He is the third doctor to die of the infection in the city and the second from the M ward, which is one of the red zones in the city. The case has highlighted the urgent need for a policy that ensures the safety of doctors practicing in containment zones. His wife, who is also a doctor, said that when the GP was in serious need of hospitalisation, the couple received no help from the helpline run by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). On May 11, the GP, who ran a clinic in Chembur, developed a mild fever. He immediately shut down his clinic. After a blood test indicated the presence of the virus that causes Covid-19, he sent his swab samples to test for Covid-19 on May 14.By the afternoon of May 15, the results hadn’t come in, but the GP had developed weakness and his oxygen saturation was below 88%. Other doctor friends recommended hospitalisation. According to his wife, the couple struggled from 3pm to 8pm to get him admitted. The BMC-run helpline (1916) was of no help. “First, they said there was one bed in Nair Hospital. When I agreed to admit him there, another attendant informed us there was no bed. They couldn’t give us any bed in Mumbai,” said his wife. The couple also inquired with private hospitals, but to no avail. Ultimately, another doctor arranged for a bed in SRV Hospital. The next obstacle was finding an ambulance, which wasn’t immediately available. “It was a horrible experience. Despite being a doctor, I never thought that I would face this situation. I had read about unavailability of beds in hospitals but until you experience it, you don’t understand that it is real,” said his wife. When they were finally able to admit the GP on May 15, he was rushed to the intensive care unit. He succumbed to the infection on Thursday, at around 7.30pm. His wife remembered how he had insisted on keeping his clinic open as long as it was safe to do so. “He would say, ‘It is our duty...we can’t increase the burden on the corporation,” said his wife. “I would often tease him saying that because of him, I would get infected but never did I know that the same virus would kill my husband,” she said. He is survived by his wife and his mother, who have quarantined themselves at home, and a son who lives in the United States of America. Other doctors say this case highlights the challenges faced by medical professionals during the pandemic. Dr Amit Thadhani, a surgeon and a friend of the deceased doctor, said GPs from small clinics should not be forced to practice if the conditions in their clinics make them vulnerable to the infection. “BMC is threatening the doctors that if they don’t practice, their license will be cancelled. But to practice in the hotspots, they require more precautions. It is extremely precarious to work in PPE and dispose of them properly in small clinics,” he said. Dr Ninad Salunke of the non-governmental organisation Apnalaya said, “It is essential for the doctors practising in these red zones to take prophylaxis drugs and focus more on their immunity. Also, the corporation needs to come up with a policy for doctors in containment zones to ensure their safety.”Despite repeated tries, Mahesh Narvekar, chief officer, disaster management cell, BMC, could not be reached for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/3rd-mumbai-doctor-dies-of-covid-wife-says-took-5-hrs-to-get-bed/story-SHtn0HJBnRqqKang1w2xdM.html
23-05-2020||Mumbai||Shortage of hydroxychloroquine in city: Chemists, pvt hospitals||The city is facing a shortage of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), a drug used for prevention (prophylaxis) as well as treatment of Covid-19, according to medical experts at private hospitals and chemists. The scarcity is also affecting patients suffering from arthritis and lupus, as the medicine is used to treat the diseases.While there is no medicine to treat Covid-19, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has recommended HCQ as a preventative drug for healthcare workers. “We don’t have HCQ. When we get patients, we have to hunt for the drug to administer it. The government should ensure that private hospitals have adequate amount of HCQ for its patients,” said Dr Deepak Baid, president of Association of Medical Consultant (AMC). HCQ is a less toxic derivative of chloroquine, a drug used in treatment of malaria. With the rising demand and government buying bulk, arthritis and lupus patients are forced to do the rounds of pharmacies across Mumbai. “I have medicines for three days. My daughter has been trying to procure the drug for four days, but can’t find it. We need the medicine as it has anti-inflammatory properties and it provides relief,” said a 57-year-old woman from Borivli who suffers from arthritis. Her family members even visited government hospitals in search of the drug. With growing awareness about use of HCQ in treatment of Covid, people have been trying to stock up on it using fake prescriptions or through black markets. “As the government has imposed restrictions on the sale of HCQ, people are getting desperate. Many chemists are selling it without bills, at a higher rate. Many suppliers have hoarded the drugs to increase the price,” said Abhay Pandey, national president, All Food and Drug Licence Holder Foundation (AFDLHF).The Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) held a meeting with the manufacturers of HCQ instructing them to increase the supply. “On Thursday, we asked the manufacturers to increase the production,” said JN Mantri, joint commissioner of Maharashtra FDA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/shortage-of-hydroxychloroquine-in-city-chemists-pvt-hospitals/story-3q2cRflVWTNBMh0IdbyKpI.html
23-05-2020||Mumbai||Liquor home delivery allowed in Mumbai, but conditions apply||Home delivery of liquor in sealed bottles will be allowed in Mumbai from Saturday, but with certain riders. Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) commissioner Iqbal Chahal, who issued a circular to the effect on Friday, said the service will not be available in containment zones, people ordering liquor will need permits issued by the excise department and no shop will be allowed to sell over the counter. Wine shop owners, however, said immediate delivery from Saturday seems difficult. “Delivery services will require nod from the collector’s office, including the excise department. We may be able to deliver only from Sunday or Monday,” said a wine shop owner, who did not want to be named.The circular, which comes five days after the state government allowed home delivery of liquor in red zones, states that the delivery can happen even through e-commerce and online platforms.However, shop owners, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they would prefer to deliver on their own rather than go through e-commerce and online platforms. The owners said they fear entry of these platforms in the liquor delivery space and that could harm their business in the future.Maharashtra consumes around 86 crore litres of liquor every year, which works out to daily consumption of around 24 lakh litres.The state government had earlier allowed opening of non-essential shops, including those selling liquor, but it resulted in crowding outside wine shops in Mumbai. The civic body then on May 5 ordered all shops selling non-essential goods to shut. The then civic chief Praveen Pardeshi had issued the order citing inputs from police and ward officials and social media posts. He had said “it has been impossible to maintain social distancing and there were few instances of law-and-order situation arising out of crowds gathering at one place”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/liquor-home-delivery-allowed-in-mumbai-but-conditions-apply/story-exrdU5IV9QfwT5Z8t65YmN.html

The last flight on the route operated on March 26. “There is no confirmation when air connectivity of the Malwa region of Punjab with the national capital will commence,” Bathinda airport director Varinder Singh said. He added that once the flights that Alliance Air, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Air India, operates resume, there will be a change in timing with the days remaining the same as Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. The airport director added that connectivity on the Bathinda-Jammu route will continue to be suspended indefinitely. The route has been non-operational since October 27. An official added, “The average occupancy on the Jammu route was 70%, which was not a fair profit-making proposition. As a cost-cutting measure, it was proposed that a single 70-seater ATR-72 plane operating between Jammu and Delhi may make a brief layover at the Bathinda airport. It was planned to use a single aircraft to cover three destinations — Delhi, Bathinda and Jammu. This proposal was shelved last year and there is no reference to a flight to Jammu in the summer schedule.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-bathinda-delhi-route-in-1st-phase-of-flight-resumption/story-GtfMsr7OatsuNbkVoMWx2L.html

23-05-2020||Mumbai||2,940 new cases take Maharashtra’s Covid-19 tally to 44,582; toll crosses 1,500||Maharashtra and Mumbai recorded the highest single-day rise in Covid-19 cases on Friday, with their tally rising to 44,582 and 27,251 respectively. While the state reported 2,940 cases, there were 1,751 cases recorded in the city. The state’s virus fatalities crossed 1,500, as 63 deaths were reported on Friday, taking the toll to 1,517. Of the fatalities, 27 were in Mumbai, nine in Pune, eight in Jalgaon, five in Solapur, three each in Vasai-Virar and Aurangabad city, two in Satara, and one each in Malegaon, Thane, Kalyan-Dombivli, Ulhasnagar, Panvel and Nagpur.Meanwhile, data from the state Medical Education and Drugs department has revealed that 86.74% of the state’s 39,144 Covid-19 patients are below the age of 60. The department has analysed data till May 20.Of these patients, 3.61% cases are of people up to 10 years; 7.05% are between 11 and 20 years; 21.08% are between 21 and 30 years; 21.44% are between 31 and 40 years, 17.76% are between 41 and 50 years; and 15.80% are between 51 and 60 years.However, highlighting that people in the 50-plus age group are most vulnerable to the disease, the department put the number of fatalities in this age group at 71% of the 998 deaths.State health department officials said measures to isolate and treat people, who are over the age of 60 with comorbidities, have helped keep them from contracting the disease. “In Mumbai and in other hotspots, we have focused our search for people over 60 years as they are vulnerable. We have advised local authorities to isolate these people from densely populated areas,” a health department official, who did not want to be named, said. Maharashtra has clocked more than 2,000 new infections every day for the past six days, recording 14,042 new cases and 382 deaths. The state has witnessed a significant rise in Covid-19 cases since May 6, when it started reporting more than 1,000 cases daily. The health department official, however, said the state has not reached the community transmission stage yet as the growth in cases is not exponential.State health minister Rajesh Tope, meanwhile, interacted with religious leaders and appealed to them to talk to people from their religions and sects about virus facts and measures. Tope, during the meeting held via video conferencing, said people have many misconceptions and fears about coronavirus. These need to be handled through the religious leaders. “Because of misconceptions and fears, people do not come forward despite having symptoms. And due to this, when they go to the doctor, it becomes difficult to treat them. Therefore, religious leaders, social institutions should encourage them to come forward for tests,” Tope said in a statement. State minorities minister Nawab Malik also participated in the meeting, where he made a similar appeal. Tope said there is a stigma attached to testing positive for coronavirus, which is a barrier for early detection in some areas of the state.Meanwhile, more than three lakh migrant labourers from Konkan division alone returned to their home states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, etc. by Shramik trains. Konkan division includes Thane, Mumbai, Raigad, Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg and Palghar districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/2-940-new-cases-take-maharashtra-s-covid-19-tally-to-44-582-toll-crosses-1-500/story-r0EtyOuu8sl4y3xMdtLY2N.html

According to a media bulletin issued by the health department, 58 samples were collected on site in the colony by a team from Government Multi-Specialty Hospital, Sector 16.“We have long felt the need to test all dwellers in a building where even one case has been reported. Usually there are around three floors in one building with a number of families living there,” said UT health secretary Arun Kumar Gupta.Arrangements have been made for those residents who want to go out of the colony and stay in a government facility, he added.Besides turning a school into a Covid care centre for the elderly and patients with other diseases, two more quarantine facilities, one in girls hostel number 8 of Panjab University and another at Government Model School, Raipur Kalan, have been established. The school will have approximately 300 beds, and the facility will be made operational from Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ut-admn-changes-strategy-in-bapu-dham-colony-all-residents-in-building-with-even-one-positive-case-to-be-tested/story-XS8Xqo8W3L1u291lFmE2LL.html
23-05-2020||Mumbai||No ban on Ganesh idols made of PoP this year||The Union environment ministry on Friday withdrew its proposed ban on the use of Plaster of Paris (PoP) for making Ganesh idols in 2020.While environment minister Prakash Javadekar said the decision to defer the ban by one year was taken to help artisans, environmentalists criticised the move, saying PoP was harmful to the environment. “The ban on PoP for the Ganesh idol has been postponed for one year. This will not harm those artisans who have already made their idols this year,” Javadekar tweeted on Friday.On May 13, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) published guidelines banning the use of PoP, thermocol, and single-use plastic for making idols across India, and encouraging the use of biodegradable and less toxic material. Dyes and toxic chemicals used to colour the idols, too, were proposed to be banned.“Based on submissions from various parts of the country about different festivals, especially Maharashtra, where idol makers have already purchased large quantities of PoP, we have lifted the ban just for this year. The decision was taken considering the Covid-19 crisis and difficult economic situation. Idol makers are directed to avoid the use of chemicals and dyes as much as possible this year,” said a senior official from the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change. “This is a temporary decision, and the ban will be implemented from 2021.”Made from Gypsum, which is heated up to 150°Celsius, PoP contains chemicals such as sulphur, phosphorus and magnesium. It is also used to make casts for broken bones. PoP idols are the cheapest (₹500-₹1,000 for a small household idol) among all material, but remain in the environment for a long time, with potential harm to aquatic life.The umbrella body of Ganesh mandals in the city, Brihanmumbai Sarvajanik Ganeshotsav Samanvay Samiti (BSGSS), had requested the Maharashtra government and the Centre to allow the use of PoP during this year’s festival. “Acquiring large quantities of clay, which is very expensive, will be very difficult for artisans during lockdown. We welcome the Centre’s decision to ensure idol makers are not harmed during this tough period. We have directed mandals to celebrate a simple festival this year,” said Naresh Dahibhavkar, president, BSGSS. “This year, 2.32 lakh large and household idols are slated to be made in Mumbai. Of these, 15% will be eco-friendly, made from clay and paper, while remaining using PoP. About 10% of 2.32 lakh idols have already been made,” said Dahibhavkar.Marine biologists said historically, PoP was never the choice for idol makers. “It has always been clay (shadu) idols not only for Ganeshotsav, but other festivals as well. PoP takes months to break down and dissolve, destroying the marine ecosystem. Considering the Covid-19 pandemic, it is our duty to be more sensitive to the environment. Lifting the ban is a bad idea,” said Vinay Deshmukh, marine biologist and former scientist, Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI).Environmentalists pointed out that the CPCB had revised its guidelines after 10 years based on an order passed by the Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court (HC) discouraging the use of PoP. “The Centre does not have the authority to override the HC’s decision, which was in the interest of the environment. Historically, the size of the idol (during Lokmanya Tilak’s time when the festival was first celebrated in the current form) was not more than nine inches. The priority of the ministry should be the opposite of the decisions it is currently taking,” said Anand Pendharkar, wildlife biologist, Sprouts Environment Trust.USE OF PoP IN MUMBAI DURING GANESHOTSAVAn average of 11,000 large (sarvajanik) idols and 1.6 lakh household idols are made every year using PoPThe use of thermocol and plastic was disallowed by the umbrella body of Ganesh mandals last year. An average of 75 large idols and 40,000 household idols are made using clay, while 250 paper idols are made annually during the 11-day Ganeshotsav festival. Lalbaugcha Raja, Mumbai Cha Raja Ganesh Galli, Andhericharaja, Fortcha Icchapurti and many other popular idols have been using PoP annually for almost a decade.Last year, 2.11 lakh idols were immersed across 129 spots in Mumbai. The figure was 2.03 lakh in 2018, 1.92 lakh in 2017, and 2.09 lakh in 2016. The percentage of eco-friendly idols increase from 2% to 5% over four years with a maximum increase in paper idols being adopted by mandals.(Source: Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, Brihanmumbai Sarvajanik Ganeshotsav Samanvay Samiti)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/no-ban-on-ganesh-idols-made-of-pop-this-year/story-3ENDqPtOkH8ij29fhhyUMJ.html
23-05-2020||Mumbai||State asks district banks to approve fresh loans for defaulting farmers under waiver scheme||The Maharashtra government is unable to waive off loan of over 11 lakh farmers under its loan waiver scheme and has asked the banks to provide fresh loans to the farmers who are eligible under the scheme. It has also assured banks that the due loan amount would be paid along with interest in the coming months as it is facing financial crisis due to Covid-19 lockdown.In an order issued on Friday, the state cooperation department has asked all the district central cooperative banks, commercial and other banks to approve fresh farm loans to farmers eligible under the scheme, even if the previous loan amount has not been cleared.“The state government will pay the due loan amount along with interest which can be charged by the banks from April 1, 2020 till the amount is not paid,” states the government resolution (GR) issued by the cooperation department.“We are not in a position to pay pending loan amount to the banks under the scheme as the revenue of the state was stopped completely since the lockdown was imposed from March 23. We need some time and thus have offered this scheme to the banks,” said a cooperation department official. The financial crisis has led the state to declare a 67% cut in its spending for developmental works this financial year in view of the estimated revenue losses of over Rs 40,000 crore in March and April. The government had declared about 32 lakh beneficiaries under the scheme. It had transferred Rs 12,000 crore in the accounts of over 19 lakh farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/state-asks-district-banks-to-approve-fresh-loans-for-defaulting-farmers-under-waiver-scheme/story-cA1Ks4oqoMtd02ZEepDMEI.html
23-05-2020||Chandigarh||HC allows private schools in Punjab to charge 70% fee||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Friday allowed private schools in Punjab to charge 70% fee from students for the academic year 2020-2021. The court also allowed schools to charge admission fee in two instalments in six months and further directed that teachers in these schools would have to be paid 70% of their salaries.The high court was hearing a petition from Independent Schools’ Association, Chandigarh, with 78-member schools in Punjab and Chandigarh. The directions have been passed with respect to schools in Punjab.Schools’ counsel Ashish Chopra said fee could be charged quarterly or annually as per schools’ rules and it could have components such as tuition fee, various funds and transport charges etc.The court was told that director school education on May 14 came out with a direction that schools can only charge tuition fee during lockdown and not building, transportation and meals charges. The schools were also directed not to cut salaries of teachers.Schools had told court that both these conditions are contradictory as parents are to be given concession of not depositing the full fee and schools are being directed not to reduce the salary of teachers. He had also demanded that private schools deposit funds to the government under ‘Reserved Fund’, with a total corpus of Rs 77 crore at present. But schools are not being helped by government even for sanitisation, he said. The May 14 order from the government came after complaints of schools asking parents to deposit fee even as state was under curfew due to Covid-19 outbreak. The government counsel had reasoned that schools charge fee under different heads and transportation charges are always separate and this cannot be made a ground to seek changes in the May 14 order.Asking the government to respond to issues raised in the petition, the high court bench of justice Ritu Bahri directed that as an interim measure, admission fee should be paid in two equal instalments in six months and the 70% of the total school fee will be charged from parents. The bench also asked the state counsel to apprise the court on the next date of hearing on June 12 as to how the state could help the private schools with ‘Reserved Fund’. Other issues raised by the schools are about validity of various instructions passed by the state administration from time to time since March with regard to not increasing school fee, deferring collection of school fee in view of Covid-19 outbreak and not sending reminders to parents to pay the fee. The association had also argued that the government order came even as schools had held online classes during the lockdown period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hc-allows-private-schools-in-punjab-to-charge-70-fee/story-W9z1IbZKeUNdzXMmHM851O.html

23-05-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra govt should announce ₹50K-cr package, says BJP||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) versus the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) battle was on full public display on Friday as the former held its Maharashtra Bachao (Save Maharashtra) agitation with party workers across the state. The BJP has also demanded an independent fiscal package worth ₹50,000 crore for farmers, daily wage earners in the state amid Covid-19 pandemic.The Opposition party workers, wearing black masks, unfurled banners slamming the Uddhav Thackeray-led government over its handling of the crisis. Two months after the first coronavirus case was identified in the state, the BJP announced that it would no longer stay quiet and spoke out against the government’s “ineffectual” tackling of the pandemic.As part of the agitation, state BJP unit party workers were seen shouting slogans against the state government and holding placards in videos on social media. The protests were held outside the party workers’ homes and party offices across the state. The protests are seen as a move to roll out a campaign to generate a sentiment against the state government.The Shiv Sena and other ruling parties did not take this lightly and slammed the Opposition for playing politics amidst a full-blown disaster. By late afternoon, the BJP’s Maharashtra Bachao campaign and the state Congress’ Maharashtra Drohi (Maharashtra’s traitors) campaigns were viral on the social media, but the former was lagging behind the latter.“The maximum number of coronavirus cases and maximum deaths are in Maharashtra. The public health system has completely collapsed due to the state government’s failures. For how long can we cooperate with the government. How much can the people tolerate?” asked Devendra Fadnavis, who protested along with his party colleagues outside the state BJP office.A day earlier, Fadnavis had upped the ante targeting Thackeray directly as someone who was new and made “strategic failures” as he lacked “administrative experience”.The former CM has also alleged that the state and the city have reduced testing of patients in a bid to bring down the Covid-19 positive cases. He has alleged that despite having a capacity of conducting 10,000 tests, the BMC was conducting only around 4,500 tests daily.Yuva Sena chief and tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray, in response to BJP’s protest, tweeted, “One political party state unit has set a new low and a new world record — the only party in the world to indulge in politics and in spreading fear, hate and division when the world has forgotten all of it to help each other. This party has forgotten the pandemic.”Re-tweeting another photo where children are wearing black clothes, holding BJP flags and protesting, Thackeray said, “Absolutely shameful, what lust for power politics can make leaders do. Making children stand in the heat, with their masks lowered, not covering their faces for a political protest when we need to keep them safe and indoors.”“Maharashtra Drohi hashtag has become viral across the country because people saw the true picture of the BJP. In the face of such a horrific disaster, only they can think of politics…‘let people die, we want power’, is their mantra,” Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant said. NCP state chief and minister Jayant Patil said, “This [the protest] is truly treachery against the state.’’||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-govt-should-announce-50k-cr-package-says-bjp/story-2dh7ocfrs1orzxC7K0hQMM.html
23-05-2020||City||Source of 19 coronavirus cases in Amritsar district still untraced||Amritsar Two days after the Punjab health department began collecting blood samples from people in four vulnerable districts under the ‘Community Transmission Surveillance Programme’ to find if the community transmission stage of Covid-19 has started in the state, there are 19 cases in Amritsar where there is no history of foreign or domestic travel or contact with any covid-19 positive patients.Amritsar has 315 positive cases to date, with 295 cured. There have been five deaths and 15 active patients, as on date. Some of those whose source of infection could not be traced have been discharged. The health department has started the trial in Patiala, Ludhiana, Jalandhar and Gurdaspur districts and Amritsar is not on the list. Amritsar civil surgeon Dr Jugal Kishore said, “To date, the district has reported 19 cases of community transmission whose source of infection are still unclear. These cases were tested for covid-19 in flu corners when they had shown symptoms of the disease. The four cases that came on Thursday are also community transmission, as these patients have no foreign travel history. The patients had not even met any identified coronavirus patient. Their source of infection is untraced.”The four tested positive on Thursday were a 15-year-old girl; a 60-year-old man from Katra Dulo area of the walled city; a 26-year-old man of Dashmesh Nagar and a two-and-a-half-month-old boy. The infant tested positive after his death at Government Medical College and Hospital (GMDH), Amritsar. The civil surgeon added, “Contact tracing of community transmission cases is on. Samples of close contacts of the four patients reported on Thursday have been sent for testing. There could be more community transmission cases in the district or state, who are asymptomatic and do not know that they are infected. Social distancing norms are critical now.” “Of 97 samples tested on Thursday, only four tested positive. On Wednesday, all 100 random samples tested negative. Even as we see a lot of negative reports, cases continue to be reported from the wider community,” said a health official, on the condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/source-of-19-coronavirus-cases-in-amritsar-district-still-untraced/story-G1l3tlpwHVH4z7e5qU3LdL.html
23-05-2020||Mumbai||Local train services must start in phases, say experts||The Covid-19 outbreak may change commute in the city’s most used public transport — the local trains. Local trains, known to be Mumbai’s lifeline, carry more than 80 lakh passengers every day. However, the services have been suspended from March 22 after the increase in the number of Covid-19 cases in the city.On an average, one 12-compartment local train ferries more than 5,000 commuters during normal hours and close to 7,000 during peak hours. Under the circumstances, maintaining social distancing inside local trains seems like a pipe dream. Experts have suggested capacity reduction in trains, having access control, screening passengers, location mapping of passengers, application to track health details of passengers and inspection inside the compartment for crowding as part of the bouquet of solutions to resume local train services. “Local train services should be introduced in phases. It is very crucial to have crowd and access control inside the compartments as well. In the first phase, local train services only for essential workers in the city should resume, and later train services for general public should be resumed but with restrictions,” said transport expert AV Shenoy.Former Central Railway general manager and retired Railway board member Subodh Jain said a protocol for commuting in public transport needs to be put in place.“Mumbai cannot restart until the local trains restart. Protocol for commuting in public transport needs to be decided. Mobile application, screening of passengers or a certificate that the person is fit to commute could be put in place. As the ticket examiner checks tickets inside trains and on stations, the examiners should be the authority. Local trains can be permitted but with identification on who will be allowed to travel,’’ said Jain.Introduction of more buses with social distancing for plying of passengers in the city should be done and then similar implementation should be done in the case of local trains. “We are unlikely to see local trains resuming for another one month. Buses should be initially introduced as the primary mode of transport in the city. School buses should also be brought in to facilitate movement of passengers. After seeing the reaction to social distancing maintained in the buses, train services should be introduced,’’ said transport expert Ashok Datar.Passenger associations have said that after train services are resumed, the government should look into changing office timings. “Local trains play a crucial role in the city’s public transport system. However, overcrowding will lead to spread of the virus rampantly. Changing office timings and allowing people to work from home is the only solution for reducing crowd,” said Subhash Gupta, president, Rail Yatri Parishad.Meanwhile, the Central Railway resumed two pairs of toy train services between Matheran and Aman Lodge railway station on Friday.The trains have been introduced in order to transport goods from Aman Lodge to Matheran. 105 packages of 2,700 kg were transported on Friday. “All safety norms including social distancing, use of mask and sanitisers, and thermal screenings were strictly followed.” said a Central Railway official.Local services for staff involved in Shramik and passenger train operationsRailways have started local train services for its own employees who are involved in the operation of Shramik and passenger trains. The National Railway Mazdoor Union (NRMU) has, however, asked railway authorities to increase local train services in order to maintain social distancing.“Maintaining social distancing is not happening in the current local train operations. A video has been circulating which shows minimum social distancing inside compartments. We have asked railway authorities to start more trains and compel 100% attendance. Railway authorities should also check on who is travelling in trains,” Said Venu Nair, general secretary, NRMU.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/local-train-services-must-start-in-phases-say-experts/story-Y67DRJxQMMmnwYu61bz3QO.html
23-05-2020||City||58-year-old Covid-19 patient dies outside Thane hospital waiting for ICU bed||After waiting for more than two hours outside a hospital in Thane, a 58-year-old Covid patient died before he could get a bed in the ICU.The man, a resident of Shantinagar in Wagale Estate, tested positive on Thursday morning.“My father had fever for the past few days. When it did not subside, we got him tested for Covid as hospitals do not admit patients only for fever,” said his 32-year-old son, who works in a bank.He contacted the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) to check the availability of a bed.“The TMC said they would call them when a bed is available. I called a few hospitals as my father’s condition was worsening. They said they will admit patients only when TMC sends them. Around 9pm, they informed that we will get a bed in Kaushalya Hospital in Panchpakhadi,” he said, adding that they took his father in an autorickshaw and they waiting for an ambulance would again delay admission.The hospital said that the man would need an ICU bed which was not available. So, they waited outside the hospital with the patient on the stretcher. “My father’s condition was worsening. He was outside the hospital on a stretcher. Around 11.30pm, when we checked with the hospital, they asked us to take him to Kalsekar hospital at Mumbra where an ICU bed is available. But, when a doctor checked him, he found that my father had passed away,” said the son.He added that the ordeal did not stop there as the hospital refused to give a death certificate, saying his father had died outside the hospital. “I had to take him to Thane civil hospital to get a death certificate and conduct the funeral following proper protocol, which went on till Friday evening.”“I have written to Thane commissioner of police to take action against the civic officials and hospital authorities who are responsible for my father’s death,” he added.Kaushalya Hospital, in a statement, said, “All beds in the hospital, including in ICU, were full. This was informed to the patient’s family. In spite of this, we tried our best to save him, but the patient died.”RT Kendre, officer on special duty for Covid, said all efforts were made to save the patient.“I got a call around 11.15 on Thursday night about the patient outside Kaushalya Hospital. When I spoke to the patient’s son, I came to know that he had breathlessness and will need an ICU. We informed him that 20 ICU beds are available at Kalsekar Hospital in Mumbra and we were ready to provide him ambulance and also reserved a bed. However, the patient and the local corporator insisted that he be admitted to Kaushalya.”Kendre claimed that he called the doctors in Kaushalya and asked them to admit the patient temporarily and try to save him. “The hospital tried to revive but he died,” he said.This incident comes a day after a 60-year-old man in Thane died as he could not get an ambulance.Local BJP corporator Narayan Pawar has also written to the chief minister about the incident.Pawar said, “TMC has failed to provide timely ambulance and treatment to Covid patients. Two people died due to delay in treatment in the past two days, both on the roads. There is no clarity on the work done by coronavirus cell.”The Maharashtra Navnirman Sena protested outside the civic commissioner’s office on Friday. Avinash Jadhav, the district president of MNS, said, “Patients are dying because of not getting an ambulance and hospital bed on time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/58-year-old-covid-19-patient-dies-outside-thane-hospital-waiting-for-icu-bed/story-M6ipbHEqwVvtWXLAXRprdM.html

23-05-2020||Lucknow||Muslims offer ‘Juma Alvida’ prayer at home in Agra, Aligarh||Muslims adhered to the lockdown guidelines and offered their prayers for ‘Juma Alwida’ or last Friday of holy Ramzan month by remaining at their homes in Agra and Aligarh.Elaborate security arrangements were made and strict vigil was maintained throughout the day which passed off peacefully in Braj region.Various religious heads and leaders of organisations had appealed in Agra and Aligarh, asking Muslim brethren to offer ‘namaz’ for ‘Juma Alwida’ while remaining at home. Such appeals were made for compliance of guidelines for lockdown which seek prohibition on gatherings during Covid-19 pandemic.It was unusual scene at Jama Masjid in Agra as the gathering on premises of this historical mosque was missing this time. Even in smaller mosques, there were no gathering and those who were present there only offered ‘namaz’ on the last Friday of holy Ramzan month.“We had made an appeal to Muslim community to comply with norms of lockdown, prohibiting mass gathering and as such ‘namaz’ for ‘Juma Alwida’ was offered at their residences,” stated Haji Jameeluddin Qureshi, the all India vice president of Jameet-ul-Quresh.Police were vigilant all through the day and marched through sensitive localities but had nothing much to do as no gathering was made at mosques and mostly the prayers were offered on this auspicious day within houses.Those offering ‘namaz’ at mosques were Imam and ‘khadim’ at these mosques and even the ‘ulema’ remained in houses for offering namaz.The Shahar Mufti in Aligarh, Mohammad Khalid Hameed too has made similar appeal to offer ‘namaz’ at houses in Aligarh. There were united voices in support as nation was fighting with coronavirus pandemic.Local intelligence units were active and special drives were conducted to ensure cleanliness beside proper water supply in localities having mixed population. Cops were found convincing religious heads to play constructive role in fight against coronavirus pandemic and had its positive impact.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/muslims-offer-juma-alvida-prayer-at-home-in-agra-aligarh/story-tZciFnZKAkFjFuiWRoj9GP.html
23-05-2020||City||Sukhbir seeks CBI probe into ‘multi-thousand crore scam’ in Centre-sent relief material||Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal demanded a CBI probe into the alleged multi-thousand crore scam in Centre-sent food material as relief to Punjab. He said that a large amount of wheat and pulses sent by Centre for 1.4 crore Punjabis found its way to the open market via Congress leaders.Addressing the media after visiting Malout, Balluana, Abohar, Fazilka, Jalalabad, Guruharsahai and Ferozepur where he flagged off wheat trucks carrying 5,000 quintal wheat to Darbar Sahib in Amritsar, the Sukhbir said he had brought the issue of diversion of central food stock to the notice of Congress leaders in Punjab and PM Modi.Terming this a crime against humanity, Sukhbir said it is shocking that migrants slept hungry in Punjab, while the state allowed diversion of wheat and pulses to Congress leaders who in turn sold the stock in open markets. He demanded a central-level inquiry into the scam. “The magnitude of the fraud is mind-boggling. Congress leaders are responsible for this crime should be brought to book,” he said.He also highlighted how liquor mafia, in league with Congress, has “looted Rs 5,600 crore from the state exchequer.” “The state excise department had suffered huge loss because government allowed distilleries run by Congress leaders and their known to take out truckloads of liquor without paying any excise duty,” he said.He said Congress legislators of Ferozepur were openly indulging in illegal mining and had been given a free rein by the Congress government. He said the legislators were also patronising the drug mafia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sukhbir-seeks-cbi-probe-into-multi-thousand-crore-scam-in-centre-sent-relief-material/story-yh8KxahJ25h01e5veDr1nK.html

Due to this, a number of migrants had been boarding the trains illegally, that is, without having tickets and without undergoing medical screening.Sources said there are some insiders in the railways as well as police who were involved in helping the migrants board the trains in an illegal way. “Before train departs from railway station, the migrants are called near the tracks and made to sit behind the wall. When train reaches near the gurdwara, the migrants are given a signal to board the train,” they said.The matter had come to the notice of the senior police officials. The staff was seen asking the migrants travelling in the train to close the doors of the coaches to avoid the entry of people on the way.Assistant commissioner of police, Waryam Singh, said, “With the deployment of 25 personnel, no complaint of illegal boarding was received on Friday.”12 SHRAMIK TRAINS LEFT ON THURSDAYMeanwhile, deputy commissioner Pradeep Agrawal said that so far, more than eight lakh migrants have got registered from Ludhiana to travel back to their home states.“Twelve trains that left from Ludhiana railway station on Friday had 1,600 passengers each.

The owner has cleared my balance and paid me salary till March. He has not asked me to join back, so I want to return to my village as it is becoming difficult to survive here. The landlords are also demanding rent and we do not have much to incur all the expenses.” “Earlier, I used to send money to my parents in the village but, during lockdown, I had to ask them to deposit some amount in my account, says Tiwari, who has a family of five, including three children.Tiwari had also applied for a Shramik special train on May 3, but he still hasn’t received an update on that. “I don’t know when my turn will come for the Shramik special train. It is better to buy tickets and board the train starting from June 1,” he added.Another migrant, Shiv Shankar Yadav, residing at Jeewan Nagar, says he has got seats reserved in Saryu Yamuna Express to travel back to Darbhanga.

23-05-2020||City||In symbolic protest, parents beg outside Ludhiana DC office for school fee||In a symbolic protest, the members of parents association and revolutionary parents association, Punjab, begged outside the deputy commissioner (DC) office, Ludhiana, seeking funds to pay for their children’s private school fee, on Friday.Over 25 members gathered outside the mini secretariat and also submitted a memorandum to the DC, urging him to ask schools not to charge any fee for the academic session 2020-21.KG Sharma, convener, parents association, Punjab, and Bhagwant Singh, convener, revolutionary parents association, said that the government should declare “no school fees for session 2020-21”.The government should also come up with a special financial package and scheme for online education and its promotion through government institutions without any fee and should pass an order for exemption of all school fees, admission fees and other charges for the entire session, they added.Sharma said, “Owing to the Covid-19 situation, it is very difficult for the general public to meet their day to day household expenses. It will have a drastic effect on the whole financial year.”Yadwinder Kaur, a member of the revolutionary parents association, said, “Parents are receiving messages from private schools to pay the increased tuition fee along with other charges.”“We have come here to request the DC to direct schools to exempt all types of fee for this session. Authorities of private schools are even demanding computer fee from parents. How can they demand computer fees when schools are closed,” she said.“Only a few parents have gathered here today as we wanted to avoid a mass gathering. If the state government doesn’t direct schools to exempt the fee for the entire session, we will protest and go on a hunger strike,” she said. LIP SEEKS FEE WAIVER; ACCUSES PRIVATE SCHOOLS OF LOOTING PARENTSRaising a voice against private schools that are forcing parents to pay school fee pertaining to the lockdown period, the leaders of the Lok Insaaf Party (LIP) submitted a memorandum with the deputy commissioner (DC) Pradeep Agrawal on Friday. LIP district president Baldev Singh said that earlier private schools used to loot the parents by charging building fee and other charges and now they have started asking for fee pertaining to lockdown period. “Every person is struggling to cater to daily needs. How will the parents submit fee for the months of April and May,” questioned Baldev Singh while adding that the state government should waive off the school fee for the lockdown period.Earlier, on May 20, over 100 parents had held a protest outside Merry Mint Public High School, Amar Nagar, alleging that the school authorities had been them asking to pay the tuition and admission fee for April and May.On May 18, the members of the Youth Akali Dal and residents had staged a protest against the state government for asking people to pay electricity bills and school fees during the lockdown in Dugri.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/parents-beg-outside-ludhiana-dc-office-for-school-fee/story-TaRzyx3Fn6EXrUbe7uA7uM.html
23-05-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram suspends border checking during rush hour to ease traffic||Gurugram Police on Friday said that the checking of movement passes at Sirhaul border— that connects Gurugram with Delhi — will be suspended daily between 6am and 9am and between 5pm to 8pm to prevent traffic congestion that the stretch has been witnessing ever since private offices were allowed to resume operations earlier this week.Police said stopping and checking every vehicle was resulting in traffic congestion up to Dhaula Kuan in Delhi, which is nearly 12 kilometres away. Hence, they will remove the barricades during these hours to ensure smooth vehicular movement.The district administration, however, reiterated that having movement passes issued through the SARAL portal was still mandatory for crossing the border. Before the lockdown on an average around 2.5 to 3 lakh cars used to run on the Delhi-Gurgaon expressway now. During the lockdown period it has come down to 15,000-20,000, said an official of Millennium City Expressways Private Limited — the concessionaire of the Delhi-Gurgaon expressway.Gurugram police commissioner Muhammad Akil said that vehicular movement has increased and employees have started travelling to their offices in industrial, corporate, and private sectors. “There is no fresh order but we have relaxed the checking due to volume of traffic entering the city during the morning and exiting in the evening. Hundreds of vehicles were piling up as the checking takes at least 40 seconds per vehicle,” he said.Akil said the police still can randomly stop and check any vehicles during the peak hours and the checking will be conducted as usual during the rest of the day — 9am and 5pm.The deployment has also been reduced to 10 police personnel from 25 in one shift after relaxation was given to the daily commuters, said police.Meanwhile, commuters faced long hours of congestion on Friday with many vehicles being denied entry after being thoroughly checked by the police on Friday. A number of people who were trying to cross the border on foot, too, were stopped for lack of valid permissions.Some, however, were lucky and managed to escape the jam. Isha Tyagi, an entrepreneur and a resident of Ardee City, said that she had to visit Delhi on Friday and her request for a pass on the SARAL portal was rejected. She still took a chance and crossed over to Delhi. “There was no checking at the border at 8am and when I asked one of the police officials, he told me that they start checking after 9am. I returned at 11am and could easily sneak back in without getting noticed,” she said.Another commuter, Shyam Yadav, who works in an information technology company in Sector 38, said he had been trying to cross the border unsuccessfully for the last 15 days. On Friday, he took a chance and got lucky. He managed to cross over without any checking. “The police were checking random vehicles and most of them had pasted the pass on their windscreens. The police at the border said that we can cross during the morning hours without any checking, so I have informed my colleagues also,” he said.The district administration, in an order, has only permitted the movement of those involved in essential services, medical and paramedical staff, and paramilitary officials and those who have administration-issued passes to cross over. Amit Khatri, deputy commissioner, said that they are maintaining the status quo on travel restrictions now between Gurugram and Delhi.The ministry of home affairs (MHA), last week, had removed all restrictions on interstate travel with the state’s consent The Gurugram district administration, however, chose to continue with the travel restrictions.A senior Delhi traffic police official said, “Since the Delhi government relaxed movement norms and allowed offices to function with full workforce, we have not been issuing any passes for intra city movement. However, the border inspections by Haryana and UP governments have been causing long jams on the Delhi side. This decision of the Gurugram police will ease peak hour rush in Delhi to a great extent.” Border areas like Sirhaul and Dundahera witnessed heavy traffic congestion during office hours starting Monday and the traffic volume is likely to increase in coming days, said police.Vijay Kumar, sub-inspector, deployed at Sirhaul border, said that the movement of vehicles has increased in the past week. “We are checking more than 1,000 passes every day. We remove the barricade when the volume of traffic is high and allow three lanes of traffic to cross. During the day, we have dedicated one lane for four-wheelers and one separate lane for two-wheelers,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-police-sets-timing-for-checking-passes-at-border-allows-free-entry-in-morning-hours/story-mBhsgZX6xPSTWa9SFrLPhJ.html
23-05-2020||Delhi||21 occupants of AIIMS shelter home test positive||At least 21 occupants of a shelter home that houses outstation patients and their attendants who come to the Capital for treatment at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) tested positive for Covid-19 on Thursday evening, district officials aware of the developments said.Many of the infected -- including a seven-year-old who has been battling cancer for over two years -- are already suffering from serious diseases and are in need of long-term treatment.The cases emerged after two patients suffering from kidney ailments who were staying at the same Delhi government shelter tested positive on Monday. “The Covid positive reports of the 21 at the shelter, majority of whom are patients of cancer and kidney disease, came on Thursday evening. Following the two kidney patients who were found positive earlier, tests were conducted of 51 occupants,” one of the district officials cited above said on condition of anonymity.He added that all the 21 fresh infections were moved to quarantine facilities at the Lok Nayak Hospital, Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty Hospital and AIIMS Jhajjar; at least seven other people from the shelter who have symptoms of the disease, but whose tests results are awaited, have been taken to the Chhatarpur quarantine facility; around 50 others, mostly attendants, have been put under in-situ quarantine at the shelter itself.The Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB) shelter home (number 148) located near gate number 5 of AIIMS had over 80 occupants until Thursday.“These patients were living in a rain basera (night shelter)-like place. They have been admitted to various hospitals for treatment. Actually, only those with some comorbid conditions are admitted to hospitals,” said Dr DK Sharma, the medical superintendent of AIIMS.A DUSIB official, who asked not to be named, said the staff has been sanitising the shelter complex, including the common toilets and bathing spaces. “The shelter has a capacity of housing around 300 people. Most of the patients and their families have already left for their home states over the past weeks, so there is enough room for maintaining social distancing. We ensure that patients do not come in close contact with each other,” he said.People staying at the shelter said that it had around 200 occupants until last month but a a large number of occupants left for their native villages over the past few weeks because the AIIMS out-patient department (OPD) was shut from March 24 onwards because of the national lockdown to contain the Covid-19 spread. Only emergency services, as well as some other wings such as cancer and gynaecology, were open with limited staff. The AIIMS administration had earlier this week said that select OPD services are likely to open soon, but have not been reopened yet.The mother of the seven-year-old who has been infected said they had travelled for treatment from Darbhanga in Bihar. “My son has been suffering from a critical disease already, and now he has got this virus. We could not even leave from Delhi -- I don’t know what will happen now and when will they return,” the woman said over the phone. She is in quarantine at the shelter with her two other children.Sandhya Devi, who came for her husband’s treatment for a liver tumour in February from Gopalganj, said they were waiting for his last chemotherapy session scheduled for May 27, after which they had hoped of leaving for home. “The doctor had told us that after the last chemo session, my husband may be fit enough to go back. Now, I don’t know for how long we will have to wait for treatment,” she said. “The occupants at the shelter have been using the common toilet facilities. Though we provide food and other essentials, they have been tired of the long wait to go back home. Since many of them were already battling diseases, the families have been worried of their members contracting the virus,” said Nitesh Kumar, project coordinator, SPYM, an NGO that runs the shelter for the Delhi government.The media advisor to the chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said, “We will examine the matter and directions will be issued to concerned agencies for swift action.”Sunil Kumar Aledia, a social activist who works with homeless people, said: “The government must arrange for proper medical care for these patients because they are already facing trauma because of the diseases and running out of their savings because of the lockdown.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/21-occupants-of-aiims-shelter-home-test-positive-several-already-suffer-from-serious-diseases/story-WBnJcOsvXVBO0iywNOf81K.html
23-05-2020||Delhi||Tenants can delay but have to pay rent, says Delhi HC||Tenants in the Capital are liable to pay rent for the period the city has been under lockdown, the Delhi High Court has held, stating that suspension of rent owed for that period is not permissible. The court, however, said some relaxation in the form of postponement of payments can be granted.A single-judge bench of Justice Pratibha M Singh said tenants cannot invoke the doctrine of suspension of rent on the basis of “a force majeure event as they (the applicants) do not intend to surrender the tenanted premises and continue to occupy it”. Force majeure is a contractual provision allocating the risk of loss, if performance becomes impossible or impracticable, especially as a result of an unanticipated or uncontrolled event.“The tenants’ application for suspension of rent is thus liable to be rejected inasmuch as while invoking the doctrine of suspension of rent on the basis of a force majeure event, it is clear from the submissions made that the tenants do not intend to surrender the tenanted premises. While holding that the suspension of rent is not permissible in these facts, some postponement or relaxation in the schedule of payment can be granted owing to the lockdown,” the court said in a 22-page judgment of May 21, uploaded to the court’s website on May 22.The court was hearing an application that had raised various issues related to the suspension of payment of rent, owing to the national lockdown, and legalities regarding the same. A nationwide lockdown was imposed by the central government from March 25 to curb the spread of Covid-19 disease. The Delhi government had put curbs on citizens’ movement in the city from March 23, owing to Covid-19 cases coming up in the Capital around that time. By March 25, there were 35 confirmed cases of the Sars-Cov-2 (the virus which causes the coronavirus disease) and death caused by it in the city.On March 29, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had appealed to landlords not to force tenants for one or two months to give rent and accept payments in instalments if the tenant is short on money. Later, in April, an order by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority had called for “strict compliance” of directions that landlords will not demand rent from migrant workers and students for a month. It required respective district magistrates to spread awareness about this directive and, in case of non-compliance, take legal action.The latest judgement came on an application filed in a pending plea by the owner of a shoe shop in Khan Market, who had sought suspension of Rs 3.5 lakh monthly rent, while also challenging the eviction over non-payment.Deciding on the factor, Justice Singh said: “The fundamental principle would be that if the contract contains a clause providing for some sort of waiver or suspension of rent, only then the tenant could claim the same…. However, if the tenant wishes to retain the premises and there is no clause giving any respite to the tenant, the rent or the monthly charges would be payable”.Though the May 21 order talks about lease agreements in general, making it eligible for both residential as well as commercial properties, the court, while laying broad guidelines, said the present case of Khan Market is not covered under the executive orders passed by the central and the Delhi governments giving protection to some classes of tenants. A senior Delhi government official in the chief minister’s office, asking not to be named, said that they would examine the order.Reacting to the order, Praveen Khandelwal, secretary-general of the Confederation of All India Traders, said while the court granted time to tenants to pay rent, a mechanism should be brought about so that the rent amount of the lockdown period can be paid in a six-month instalment period.“A major chunk of our expenditure goes towards rent for shops. Also, as per the government’s directions, we are bound to pay salaries to employees. In the light of this, a mechanism should be brought about so that we can clear the rent dues by a six-month instalment,” he said.After the lockdown was put into effect, several student groups living in rented accommodations across the Capital had written to Kejriwal, asking for help on similar grounds. Varkey Parakkal, founder of a Student Tenant’s Union, said the high court’s judgment of May 21 would not be applicable to students as the court had refused to examine the legalities of certain executive orders passed by the centre and the Delhi governments.“We got the judgment examined by our lawyers who said this order would not cover the executive orders passed by the authorities time to time in case of migrant labours, students and daily wagers. Hence, our rights are reserved,” he said.Atul Goyal, President of United Residents’ Joint Action, said there is a unilateral agreement between tenants and their landlords on humanitarian grounds and hence, both of them should chalk out a strategy on this.In the matter decided May 21, while the counsel for the petitioner had sought a waiver on the rent and postponement of payments, the advocate for the landlord had contended that mere suspension of work would not give the liberty to tenants to not pay rent as the revenue streams of landlords are also dependent on rent money.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/tenants-must-pay-rent-for-lockdown-period-delhi-hc/story-Ic6gTeceZNWDshnmioVumO.html
23-05-2020||City||Taking jingles route to dissuade Punjab farmers from burning wheat straw||To educate farmers about ill-effects of burning wheat straw in fields and inspire them to avoid doing so, Ludhiana deputy commissioner Pradeep Kumar Agrawal, on Friday, released a set of four jingles (a short slogan, verse, or tune designed to be easily remembered, especially as used in advertising).These jingles have been prepared jointly by experts of Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) and the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB).Anil Sharma, assistant director (television), PAU, said, “The jingles have been prepared to educate farmers about the ill-effects of burning of wheat straw. The lyrics of these jingles have been penned by Punjabi poet Prof Gurbhajan Gill, and sung by folk singer Rajinder Malhar. Dialogues are by singer Harmit Singh and Dr Anil Sharma. All the actors in these jingles are students of PAU namely Harjoban Singh, Jaswant Singh, Abhishek Vij, Sharan Aulakh, Prabh Dhaliwal, Palwinder Baasi, master Anhad Prem Singh (son of a PAU employee) and Surinder Singh.He said, “PAU has been preparing such jingles on various issues regularly. When an issue is raised in the form of a jingle, its reach increases manifold.”Releasing the jingles, Agrawal said the district administration has been continuously making dedicated efforts to educate farmers about the ill-effects of burning wheat straw and it is due to these efforts that the number of fire incidents has decreased during the last two years and these incidents are decreasing with each passing year.He said the number of fire incidents from June 2017 to May 21, 2018 was 730, followed by 717 till May 21, 2019, and till May 21 this year, fire incidents came down to 648.He said this has been possible because all stakeholders are working hard to bring down the incidents.Sandeep Bahl, senior environmental engineer, PPCB, Ludhiana, urged farmers of the district to act responsibly and not indulge in burning of wheat straw in larger interest of the people.He said, “The burning of wheat straw reduces soil fertility and also pollutes our environment. Its burning amid Covid-19 pandemic can be more dangerous as smoke can aggravate the problems of breathing, lungs, etc.”He said FIRs are being taken against the farmers, who are burning wheat straw.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/taking-jingles-route-to-dissuade-farmers-from-burning-wheat-straw/story-pLkbalbIxy14V7qnIpxXAI.html
23-05-2020||Delhi||Only 66 of 239 eligible private liquor shops in Delhi to open for now||Less than a third of the 239 privately run liquor stores will be allowed to open from Saturday, according to excise department order on Friday that approved 66 of these shops to open under the condition that they adhere to the odd-even rule in place for market places.Delhi on Monday allowed liquor stores to open, unless they were in a mall, the airport or containment zones. There are 239 privately run shops that are eligible to open but needed to first submit stock records and declare they are not in a containment zone. Friday’s order, issued by special commissioner (excise) Sandeep Mishra, cleared 66 of them and also warned store owners against selling liquor without scanning the barcodes on the products. “In case of any un-scanned sale, the MSR (monthly stock record) gap generated shall be treated as the stock sold and 70% Special Corona Fee shall be levied,” read the order. Excise officials said that these 66 shops will be allowed to operate from Saturday on alternate days between 9am and 6.30pm. With this, more than 240 liquor stores will be allowed to reopen since the first relaxation order was issued by the excise department on May 4. There are 864 liquor shops in Delhi. Of these, 172 were standalone, government-run shops allowed to open first, with more being opened in phases. When asked about the remaining stores, a senior official said, “We have issued directions to the municipal corporations to also open their stores, but only on odd-even basis. More stores will be granted approvals soon.”The excise department, however, has so far not compiled the number of liquor stores under the municipal corporations that will be allowed to reopen.The delay in the order issued by the government left many private liquor store operators disappointed as they complained of not being able to reopen their shops despite complying with all the state orders. “I submitted the required undertaking that our outlet does not fall under a Covid-19 containment zone. I also updated the stock list the day before yesterday. The approval should have come on Thursday,” RS Mittal, who co-owns a liquor store on Vikas Marg said. In its May 18 order, the excise department did mention that all L-7 licensees (private liquor shops) are directed to conduct monthly stock record (MSR) updates between May 19 and May 21 (Friday). “Only after submission of the MSR compliance report and the undertaking, the shops will be allowed to open on the odd-even basis (sic),” the order stated. Vinod Giri, the director-general of the Confederation of Indian Alcoholic Beverage Companies, said that even as more liquor stores are reopening in the city, they are not pulling as much crowd as they should. “The massive crowds and rampant violation of social distancing norms that we saw earlier are no longer there. Our initial reports suggest that after the 70% corona cess was imposed, sales have reduced. Even though liquor rates in Haryana and other states have increased by 10-15%, they are still cheaper than Delhi,” Giri said. He added that the industry met excise minister and deputy CM Manish Sisodia to demand a roll-back of the cess. Senior government officials said that the matter was discussed on Thursday by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and the rest of the cabinet ministers. “But it was decided that we would wait because the government does not have the complete liquor sale data as of now to fully assess the impact of the corona cess,” said a senior government official on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/only-66-of-239-eligible-private-liquor-shops-to-open-for-now/story-2zI79oCcMqddAR4XxaW0hI.html

We had witnessed pleasant weather during the beginning of the month, but that does not help the monsoon in moving forward,” she said.PUNJAB MAY RECEIVE SHOWERS, SAYS WEATHERMANThe meteorologist also said, “There is slight chance of rain in central Punjab in a couple of days as some western disturbance has been noticed in the border region of Afghanistan and Pakistan.” On May 15, the meteorology department observatory of PAU had recorded 12.4mm rain. The maximum temperature on Friday was 32 degree Celsius and minimum was 22.6 degree Celsius.Meanwhile, a total of 41.2mm rain has been recorded in a fortnight.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sunny-days-ahead-says-pau-weather-department/story-qZaanpPvPSVddKV6D3RxOJ.html
23-05-2020||City||Ludhiana DC rejects arhityas pleas, says sabzi mandi to open only 3 days a week||Rejecting the arhtiyas’ demand of allowing the main wholesale sabzi mandi, situated near the Jalandhar Bypass, to open for six days a week, the three-member committee, formed by deputy commissioner (DC) Pradeep Agrawal, has recommended that the restrictions imposed on the mandi operations should continue till lockdown in the state.The committee, which has sub-divisional magistrate (SDM, West) Amrinder Singh Malhi, additional deputy commissioner of police-1 (ADCP) Gurpreet Singh Sikand and district mandi officer (DMO) Jaswinder Dhaliwal as members, recommended that passes should not be issued to 700 more customers as demanded by arhtiyas.“The number of arhtiyas and their staff is around 1,500 and, if 700 more people are allowed to enter the market apart from ward-wise vendors, there will be a huge gathering in the mandi. So, the committee recommended that the mandi should be allowed to operate only for three days a week till the lockdown is lifted,” said Dhaliwal, adding, “No chances should be taken at this time when new cases of Covid-19 continue to come up in the city.”The recommendations were made during a meeting of the committee held on Friday and the report was submitted to DC Agrawal for taking a decision on the same.Agrawal said, “As per recommendations of the committee, the present system would continue and mandi operations would be allowed for three days a week only.” Following complaints of a huge gathering at the sabzi mandi, the administration had, on April 3, restricted the sale of vegetables and fruits in the mandi to three days -- Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. Only listed suppliers and vendors, who sell vegetables to street vendors in the city’s 95 wards, were issued passes to enter the market.Ruing losses due to decline in sales, the arhtiyas had demanded that the mandi be opened for six days a week and 700 customers, other than vendors, should be allowed to enter the mandi.President of the Ludhiana Sabzi Mandi Arhtiya Association Gurkamal Singh had pleaded that arhtiyas had been facing losses as their regular customers were not allowed to enter the market. The vendors, listed with the market committee, purchase vegetables from a few arhtiyas only, as they illegally buy vegetables from other markets situated outside the city, he had said.Singh had said arhtiyas also faced losses as perishable items rotted in a day. He had also said that they were ready to take all required precautions, if the administration opened the mandi six days a week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/main-sabzi-mandi-in-ludhiana-to-open-for-three-days-a-week-only-entry-of-more-customers-not-allowed/story-NNwXTDTbqDVpI1m0UXUhON.html
23-05-2020||Chandigarh||Plan for social distancing before starting OPDs, PGIMER doctors told||Doctors at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) have been asked to make plans for resuming outpatient services on the basis of social distancing norms. All departments have been asked to give details of the number of patients to be accommodated at the outpatient departments (OPDs) on the basis of social distancing.No date has been finalised as yet to resume services, with UT health secretary Arun Gupta saying it was a tough call. “OPDs are generally overcrowded, be it the Government Medical College and Hospital or PGIMER. It is going to take some time to decide how the OPDs will reopen,” he said. PGIMER director Dr Jagat Ram, said it was impossible to resume services until precautionary measures were in place. “We are pushing for popularising telemedicine and tele-consultation services through which need-based appointments can be provided as few patients may also require physical diagnosis.” The appointment will be provided only through tele-consultation services based on the requirement of the patient and the decision of the doctor concerned, he said.Even though the lockdown in the city has been lifted partially, OPDs in hospitals have not restarted. PGIMER is also focusing on strengthening the referral system.The UT administrator has also stressed on the need to develop a mechanism to ensure that the burden of patients can be shared among all medical institutions in Chandigarh.Around 10,000 patients visit the PGI in a day, most of whom travel long distances from neighbouring states for better medical services, which have remained shut since March 19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/plan-for-social-distancing-before-starting-opds-pgimer-doctors-told/story-Bf2KKnYtTR5naYzP2OGHAJ.html

Protesting parents said the school had no right to charge fee when it was not taking any online classes during the lockdown.One of the parents had on Thursday filed a formal complaint with the UT education department against the school.Parents protesting outside the school said they wanted to give a signed undertaking to the school authorities, but they refused to receive it. They alleged,“Instead of listening to our demands, the school authorities called in police. It was only later that the school authorities let two parents meet the principal. However, they still they didn’t take the list of demands from us.”Meanwhile, refuting parents’ allegations regarding overcharging fee from students, Naresh Handa, assistant director of the school, said, “The parents’ claims that the school has increased the fee and is charging development fee and computer fee, along with the tuition fee, are completely false.” “There is only 8% increase in fee as permitted by the law. We have the most genuine fee structure in Chandigarh and we give the best salaries to our staff as well,” added Handa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/parents-protest-outside-chandigarh-school-over-fee-collection-amid-lockdown/story-3Omj9frDfpHZpj5R9CP6qO.html

23-05-2020||City||Buddha Nullah desilting yet to start, residents face risk of water overflowing during monsoon||With the municipal corporation (MC) failing to commence desilting of the Buddha Nullah with dragline excavators, a risk of the nullah overflowing during the coming monsoon season looms large over the areas situated in the vicinity of the nullah as accumulating silt is visible on the surface at different points. The process, supposed to commence in the first week of April for increasing the capacity of the drain, has not been initiated till now and the nullah is filled with silt at different points, including New Kundanpuri and Shiv Puri. Facing a fund crunch, the MC has initiated the process of cleaning the sides of the nullah with the help of earthmovers, but these machines have limited reach and cannot clean the nullah properly. As per information, the MC gets the nullah desilted from the drainage department as the MC does not have dragline excavators, required for desilting.An MC official, requesting anonymity, said, “The drainage department had recently asked the MC to submit Rs 80 lakh for starting the desilting process, but the MC has, on the other hand, deployed JCB machines for cleaning the nullah citing fund crunch.” The MC has been delaying this process for the past few years, due to which the nullah overflows from different points, putting the general public on the receiving end. The nullah usually overflows in New Kundanpuri and Upkar Nagar areas almost every year and residents have to bear the brunt of the failure of the MC in desilting the nullah on time. As the nullah is the main drain of the city, the sewer system across the city gets choked when the nullah overflows. The internal drains, including the ones in Dharampura, through which sewer waste is discharged into the nullah, also overflows. Leader of BJP councillors in the General House of the MC, councillor Sunita Rani said, “A major threat looms over the residents of the city, but the civic body is not doing anything. Last year also, the nullah overflowed in New Kundanpuri, Shiv Puri, Jain Nagar and surrounding areas and filthy sewer water entered the houses of residents. The MC should have commenced the process with the help of dragline excavators in the beginning of April as it is an annual activity and officials know that we have to clean the nullah every year. We will meet mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu in a day or two for getting desilting initiated.” A resident of New Kundanpuri, Ratan Singh, said, “The nullah overflows near New Kundanpur Puli every year and filthy water enters our houses damaging furniture and electronic goods. Despite repeated requests, the MC has failed to find a solution to the problem and the civic body has also been delaying the process of desilting the nullah. This year also, the process has been delayed and the MC would not be able to clean the nullah in time, which would ultimately leave residents a harried lot.” Mayor Sandhu said, “The civic body has already deployed JCB machines for cleaning the nullah and, if needed, dragline excavators will also be deployed. The MC is also looking at an alternative to get certain stretches of the nullah cleaned from a private firm.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-proper-desilting-of-buddha-nullah-residents-face-risk-of-water-overflowing-during-rainy-season/story-DU4wL1s64m6YOeHbhEq6ZM.html
23-05-2020||Delhi||Delhi Covid cases rise by 660 in a single day, total death toll 208||The number of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in the national capital rose by 660 between Thursday and Friday, the biggest single-day spike in the tally, according to figures released by the government.Delhi’s tally on Friday crossed 12,000. The city-state also recorded 14 deaths, taking the toll over the 200 mark to 208, according to the daily health bulletin released by the Delhi government.Experts said that while the jump appeared to be the most serious yet, the numbers need to be studied along with testing data to determine the trajectory of the disease. An analysis of the daily new cases showed that the multiple in which cases have increased daily has varied in the range of 0.7-1.6 in the past week, with significant fluctuations that make it difficult to determine whether the growth of the outbreak has changed.Officials and experts have said easing of the lockdown restrictions, resumption of long distance air and rail travel services, and the movement of hundreds of thousands of migrants are likely to lead to a spurt in infections. “The calculation of the rate of increase based on the numbers that we have is very superficial. If you test more people, you will find more positive cases. We still do not know what percentage of the population was exposed to the infection,” said Dr Shobha Broor, former head of the department of microbiology at All India Institute of Medical Sciences. For the last four days, over 500 cases have been recorded in the daily health bulletin. This was the second of three scenarios for which a five-member expert committee had advised the Delhi chief minister to prepare. The first scenario was Delhi reporting 100 cases a day and the third was 1,000 cases a day.The committee plans to co-opt private hospitals, hotels and rest houses for travellers for isolation wards as the number of cases start increasing in the city.Broor warned that given the high proportion of asymptomatic cases, detecting new infections will be difficult. “None of the mathematical modeling have so far been able to predict the rise in the cases accurately. Plus, we say 80% of the cases are asymptomatic but we haven’t really done any serological studies to estimate the burden of the disease so far. We have to do antibody tests in selected cohorts both in high-burden and low burden areas to find out the number of asymptomatic cases there,” said Dr Broor. It was the first time that the number of cases on a single day exceeded 600. So far, the national capital has reported 12,319 cases of the viral infection.Of the 208 deaths, 135 have been added since May 12 when the three-member death review committee started recording previous fatalities after a discrepancy surfaced between the number of deaths reported in the daily health bulletin and the numbers from hospitals.Home isolation has helped reduce the need for institutional isolation facilities, with almost 37% currently with the infection being in home quarantine. Of the 6,214 active cases, 1,835 people with severe symptoms have been admitted to designated Covid-19 hospitals.Of the people in the hospitals, 169 are in the intensive care unit with 27 on ventilators, according to the Delhi health bulletin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-covid-cases-rise-by-660-in-a-single-day-total-death-toll-208/story-25lA98FOHbmuYD3B5TIWpN.html
23-05-2020||Noida||Noida opens up more lanes as border check posts lead to jams||The traffic congestion at the Delhi-Noida borders, which had become something of a mainstay since Tuesday when lockdown restrictions were eased to allow interstate movement, reduced slightly on Friday, but that had little to do with a reduction in vehicular numbers, which commuters claimed was back to what it used to be before the lockdown.Gautam Budh Nagar is continuing to keep its borders sealed and only people with administration-issued passes and those involved in essential services are being allowed across the state lines.“In addition, we are also allowing lawyers to travel, in pursuance to an order from the Delhi high court. Till e-passes are issued to lawyers, we are letting them pass after verifying their ID cards. In addition, people who have medical appointments are also allowed cross the borders even if they don’t have a pass -- all they need are the medical documents. However, people who still have no emergency or a government-issued pass are not being allowed to cross the state lines,” Noida’s deputy commissioner of police, zone 1, Sankalp Sharma, said.He said more lanes have been opened at all border points to accommodate the increased volume of traffic. Both officials and commuters are blaming the traffic congestion on people who are travelling without any specific reason.“The notifications have not changed for Noida for weeks now. People know that the border remains sealed and they are still coming up with various excuses to travel. When we ask them to go and obtain a pass, they start arguing, holding up traffic unnecessarily. Some of them have even been booked under Section 188 but every day, there are a few people who try to break the rules. We have coordinated with the Delhi Police regarding this issue,” a senior police officer, requesting anonymity, said.Commuters feel that the traffic volume is back to what it used to be before the nationwide lockdown was imposed on March 25, to curtail the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).“The normal 50-minute journey from Faridabad to Noida took me almost 1.5 hours on Friday via Kalindi Kunj because in addition to the large number of vehicles, police are also checking each motorist for passes and valid documents. Then there are vehicles that are being turned away for want of necessary papers,” said Amrinder Singh, a commuter, who lives in Faridabad and works in Noida.The situation is much worse when one is trying to enter Noida. “For us, the evening commute back to Faridabad is smooth, even during peak hours. But at the borders, we see a massive jam almost every day on the Delhi side as motorists queue up to enter Noida. There seems to be a lack of coordination between the Noida and Delhi Police,” Singh said.With more and more organisations resuming work at full staff strength, there is pressure on commuters to travel.“I told been told by the HR this weekend that we will now resume work at full scale. But travelling daily is a hassle. It’s easy in the mornings because Delhi Police is not checking commuters, but returning home to Noida is a struggle. Several of my colleagues have asked our company to get passes issued but that hasn’t been done either. We have had to make up excuses while returning to Noida,” an IT startup company employee, who travels from Noida to Delhi via DND Flyway, said.With state governments yet to iron out the issues, confusion reigns supreme at borders. “I saw on Thursday that the border has opened and that is why I was trying to go to Delhi to visit my in-laws but police didn’t let me through -- they said the border continues to be sealed for non-essential personnel,” Sandhya, a commuter trying to cross the Chilla border, said.The GB Nagar district magistrate and police commissioner had released a joint statement Thursday clarifying that the border status quo continues to be maintained until further instructions from the state government. The administration has written to UP government for a clarification on the issue and is yet to receive any reply.On DND Flyway, police have already been forced to open up more lanes instead of the single lane that was functioning during the lockdown until Tuesday.“Even checking passes is no longer feasible because that tends to hold up traffic. Some vehicles we recognise and some we let go. We check every third or fourth car and people who do not have the necessary papers are asked to turn back,” a Noida police constable manning DND Flyway said..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/congestion-eases-slightly-at-borders-commuters-feel-traffic-back-to-normal/story-6vTbhCKGYs5JzVbf1Zw3bO.html
23-05-2020||City||Ludhiana: GNDEC organises online laboratory training programme||The electrical engineering department of Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College, in association with the Virtual Labs, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Roorkee, organised an online training programme for laboratory work for students.Programme coordinator Arvind Dhingra said,“We were feeling that with online theory classes students were missing out on practical lab training. To address this issue, the department contacted Virtual Labs, IIT, Roorkee.”Virtual labs gives students of various disciplines a hands-on experience of working in a laboratory class right from their homes.Kanwardeep Singh, head of department (electrical), said that the Virtual Labs project is an initiative taken by the ministry of human resource development (MHRD), government of India, under the aegis of national mission on education through information and communication technology (NMEICT).The project has been undertaken by twelve institutes and IIT Delhi as its coordinating institute.Around 100 Virtual Labs consisting of approximately 700+ web-enabled experiments have been designed for remote-operation and viewing. Experts from IIT, Roorkee, trained over 1,025 students and 24 faculty members. Chetan Dhiman and his teammates Amit Kumar and Priyadarshini, under the guidance of Virtual Labs project coordinator RP Singh, delivered the sessions.Principal Sehijpal Singh appreciated the efforts of the organisers and said that online learning was the need of the hour.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-gndec-organises-online-laboratory-training-programme/story-Rv4xmRtMxk36hXs7KHLt4J.html
23-05-2020||City||Ignoring social distancing norms, 150 parents gather at govt school in Ludhiana to collect books||Flouting social distancing rules, over 150 parents and their wards gathered at Government High School, Kailash Nagar, to collect textbooks for the new academic session.After a video, showing parents jostling against each other, started circulating on social media, district education officer (DEO-secondary) Swaranjit Kaur issued a notice to the school headmistress, asking reason for the negligence.School headmistress Balwinder Kaur said, “We had sent a message in the WhatsApp groups of Classes 8 to 10, asking students to collect the books in time slots assigned as per their roll number. But a large number of parents gathered in the school with their wards. Despite repeated requests to maintain social distancing, nobody listened to us. Due to the hot weather and space constraints in the school, the parents were in a hurry to get the textbooks.”The school headmistress had to call the police to control the situation as parents were not listening to them. After cops reached the campus at 11am, parents and their wards were asked to stand in a queue, at a distance of one metre from each other.“I apologise for our mistake as we should have asked a single class to come and collect the books. We started the book-distribution process on Thursday. Students, who had failed to collect the books yesterday, also reached the school today (on Friday). As the school has an area of 362 square yards, we have no extra space to handle such a large crowd,” she said.“Also, on the same day, a lot of parents turned up to enrol their children in different classes. We told them to call us as the school had been opened just to distribute books. New admissions can be conducted online,” she added.A teacher at the school, requesting anonymity, said, “We had received four textbooks for Class 8, seven for Class 9 and one for Class 10 from the block office and were asked to distribute them at the earliest. Moreover, we have to send the details to the nodal officer of the Mangat 2 block regarding the number of books received and distributed. Though we requested the parents to maintain social distancing, nobody bothered to follow the directions.”DEO Swaranjit Kaur said, “We have asked the schools to hand over the new textbooks class-wise and upload the report daily on the web portal. Instead of asking students of one class to come and collect the books, the school authorities called children of three classes. The school authorities must have prepared a proper schedule to distribute the textbooks, but in a hurry, they violated the social distancing norms.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ignoring-social-distancing-150-parents-gather-at-govt-school-in-ludhiana-to-collect-books/story-pt3qfCC5L1H2jadd1VXzkK.html
23-05-2020||Delhi||Shaheen Bagh market, closed since stir, opens after 5 months||Perfectly drawn circles adorn the lane outside shops in Shaheen Bagh market, but there are no customers. Inside the shops, workers carefully check the garments for damage — trousers nibbled by rats, shirts with dust-filled creases. The shirts have to be sent back, washed, and ironed before they can be put on display again.The nationwide lockdown began on March 25. For the traders of Shaheen Bagh, it began many months earlier, on the evening of December 16, 2019.“We heard reports of stone-pelting in Jamia Nagar that afternoon. We were watching the news when we saw policemen chasing a mob outside our shops. The police asked us to down the shutters on our shops. We left in a hurry. The whole market closed within minutes, around 4pm. We did not know then that we would only be back more than five months later,” said Sairaq Aziz, a 32-year-old shopkeeper.On December 16, a group of local residents, led by elderly women, blocked Road 13A outside the market to protest the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, or CAA, which had been passed in Parliament a few days ago. The protesters stayed on the street for 100 days.As shops stayed shut over all of winter, traders continued to suffer losses, even as the number of protesters on the road grew; the site became a symbol across the country of voices against the Act.Over three months later, on March 24 morning, Delhi Police evicted the protesters, removed the tents set up on the road, and erased the anti-government messages written on the walls. The Delhi government had issued prohibitory orders to stem the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19), that had made its way to the National Capital by then.While the road was finally clear, the shops had to stay shut. The government had ordered the closure of all markets as a precautionary measure.With the lockdown being eased, and shops allowed to open in Delhi last week – subject to their adhering to government guidelines, the market has begun to awake from its slumber. But their wares have few takers.“First it was the protest. Now it’s the disease. We have opened shops but nobody is coming here. Most traders have shut shop and left because they could not bear the losses,” said Sharik Malik, 21, who works at a garments’ store.From multi-storey showrooms that sell imported garments to traders who sell locally manufactured clothes and other goods, there are around 200 shops in the Shaheen Bagh market.On Friday, only around 40 shops were open, when at least 100 shops should have been open. The government on Monday allowed shops to open on alternate days, while following the ‘odd-even’ arrangement.“We were fortunate to survive the protest and the lockdown, but the trader next door has shut his business. He could not sustain the losses. Imagine having to pay rent and salary of the staff while there has been absolutely no business for five months,” Malik said.The monthly rent for a showroom, which are mostly factory outlets, in Shaheen Bagh ranges between ₹75,000 and ₹3 lakh.At another store, Rahul Jha, 39, has finished collecting all the clothes that rats had nibbled. “Nobody will buy these clothes. Most shops here are in basements, so rodents and water seepage is a common problem. We will be blamed for not storing these garments properly. When we hurriedly closed shop in December, we just switched off the lights and escaped,” Jha said.Nasir Hussain, 52, owns an Allen Solly showroom and is also the president of the Shaheen Bagh market association. “I checked with my employees this afternoon. We sold one piece of clothing through the entire day. Normally, during the festive season, we would earn at least ₹1.5 lakh every day. The losses that the market has suffered could be hundreds of crores.”Hussain said many shopkeepers have not returned to their shops because have been unable to sustain their businesses. Fridays at Shaheen Bagh is usually a big day for traders. During Ramzan and especially the last Friday before Eid, the turnout of shoppers is the highest. But not this week. Most traders said the market’s proximity to containment zones (areas that are sealed off due to a cluster of Covid-19 cases) is also keeping people away. The lane behind the market and another one in nearby Abul Fazal zone was a containment zones.The few shops that had customers were those selling children’s clothing. Israr Alam, 35, who owns a shop by the name of Israr exports said he hasn’t sold anything in the last few days. “Adults now prefer to wear their old clothes. Children outgrow their clothes, so some people buy clothes for their young ones out of desperation. I do not know how long I will be able to go on like this,” he said.Many traders said they are worried only about Covid-19 now. They said they are certain there won’t be a similar protest-related closure again. They also point towards a bright white tent on the road set up by the police.Outside the tent, two Delhi Police constables were busy managing the traffic. Seven armed Central Reserve Police Force personnel had arrived to start their shift at the road. As the shops closed one after another in the evening, the paramilitary force personnel wore their riot protection gear and started patrolling the lanes. They had a job to do. Their task was clear — ensure there is no protest at Shaheen Bagh again.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/for-traders-in-shaheen-bagh-the-lockdown-began-in-december/story-2PYY1rRdsrKtHBfsxV0rCL.html
23-05-2020||Delhi||Why were two patients, residing in the night shelter outside AIIMS, shifted to far off hospitals: HC to govt||The Delhi High Court on Friday directed the chief secretary to file a report with regard to the manner in which the night shelter at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) is being managed by the Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB) and undertake all corrective measures without any delay. The court’s direction came after it noted that 22 outstation patients tested positive for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on Thursday evening.A bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Rajnish Bhatnagar also directed the principal secretary, health, of the Delhi government, DUSIB, and AIIMS to file an affidavit detailing why two patients, residing in the night shelter outside the hospital, were shifted to hospitals far away and not accommodated in the AIIMS Covid-19 facility when they tested positive.The court asked the chief secretary to look into the various grievances raised by the petitioners—Karan Seth, a lawyer, and Rachna Malik, a social worker —who had filed pleas on different issues facing the outstation patients residing at a shelter home outside AIIMS.“We direct that today’s order be placed before the chief secretary, GNCTD (Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi) and after examining the report that may be prepared after today’s visit, including the videograph, we direct him to examine the position with regard to the manner in which the night shelter at AIIMS is being managed by DUSIB, and to undertake all corrective measures, as are called for, without any delay. A further status report be filed by DUSIB, GNCTD, AIIMS and Malik,” the court said.Reacting to the order, chief secretary Vijay Dev said, “I will ensure DUSIB, as also other agencies, discharge their responsibilities to the full satisfaction of the court.”The media advisor to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said, “We will examine the matter.”In his plea filed through advocate Arjun Syal, Seth requested the court that directions be given to the authorities to provide free treatment to 100 outstations patients residing at the shelter home outside AIIMS.On Friday, Malik, through her counsel, Vaibhav Pratap Singh informed the court that there was no potable drinking water facility at the night shelter. She also pointed out that the toilet facility at the night shelter was inadequate and filthy, and not properly maintained throughout the day, due to lack of sufficient water.“Though the toilets are cleaned twice a day, due to lack of water, they get soiled very fast, and the sewer line is choked,” she submitted, adding that there is no regulation of people entering the night shelter. She said that the mother of one of two persons infected at the night shelter has left the premises.However, the counsel appearing for the director of the night shelter refuted the contentions and stated that the toilets used at night are separate and are regularly maintained. Whenever the toilets are choked, they are attended to by DUSIB, he submitted.Following this, the court ordered an inspection of the night shelter on Friday wherein the proceedings would be videographed and statements of those occupying the night shelter would also be recorded – to ascertain the factual position.The court also noted the submission of the DUSIB made in its status report stating that the two patients who tested positive from the night shelter were shifted to Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Hospital and Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital while remarking, “…..we are at loss to understand as to why they were not taken to the AIIMS Covid facility, and why they have been shifted to far off hospitals when they were staying in the night shelter outside AIIMS.The bench called upon a report from the principal secretary, health department, of the Delhi government, DUSIB and AIIMS and posted the matter for further hearing on May 27.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/why-were-two-patients-residing-in-the-night-shelter-outside-aiims-shifted-to-far-off-hospitals-hc-to-govt/story-AipVNTmQj6A0DQ15S3HRPK.html
23-05-2020||Delhi||Mess worker at AIIMS dies with Covid-19, docs say safety flouted||A worker from one of the hostel canteens at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) died of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on Thursday night, making him the first known death in a hospital campus in Delhi.“He had some cardiac issues and he was positive for Covid-19. He did not work in any patient area,” Subhashish Panda, deputy director of administration at AIIMS, said. He worked at the hostel mess of the Rajendra Prasad Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences, which is frequented by doctors, nurses and other health care workers.The resident doctors’ association (RDA) in a letter to the director of the hospital demanded the resignation of the hostel superintendent and the senior warden for alleged “failure” to put in place protective measures.“We had demanded regular screening wit thermal scanner and availability of masks, sanitisers, etc., in the mess so that they work safely without endangering themselves and the hospital staff, over a month ago. However, nothing was really done. Sanitisers would sometimes be available but there was no screening at all, anybody could just walk in,” said Dr Srinivas Rajkumar T, general secretary of the hospital RDA.A letter to the director written on Friday states, “We demand testing of all mess workers and residents by diligent contact tracing and ensure such incidences don’t repeat. We demand appointment of a more receptive and resident friendly hostel superintendent and senior warden.” The doctors have also requested the administration to pay compensation to the family of the mess worker.“It is very unfortunate that one of the staff members has died. However, the doctors should not raise such allegations, several measures are being taken to prevent infection in the hospital,” said a senior official from the hospital administration. So far, at least 130 hospital staff have tested positive for Covid-19 at AIIMS. Across Delhi, at least 560 health care workers have tested positive for the infection.“So far, there is no instance of any of the health care workers or hospital staff acquiring the infection from the hospital. We have nodal officers in the hospital who educate the staff on practising safety measures not only in the hospital but also outside,” Panda said.Meanwhile, doctors across hospitals in Delhi protested with a black ribbons on Friday demanding proper quarantine and testing of health care workers after Covid-19 duties to ensure they do not carry back the infection to their homes. “We will continue our black ribbon protest tomorrow as well and hold a candle-light vigil. We want the ministry to amend its recent quarantine guidelines,” said Dr Shivaji Barman, president of the Federation of Resident Doctors Association. Healthcare workers used to work for 14 days and then go for quarantine for the next 14 days to ensure they did not have the infection when they went home or to work. The union ministry guidelines on May 15 said that the 14-day quarantine was not necessary unless there was a breach of the personal protective equipment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mess-worker-at-aiims-dies-with-covid-19-docs-say-safety-flouted/story-ujWtFyuUvvtdlEpoK6EJQJ.html
23-05-2020||City||Ludhiana BJP unit welcomes newly appointed district president||Pushpinder Singhal, who was appointed as the district president of Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP’s) Ludhiana unit two days ago, was welcomed by the workers at the party office on Friday.The occasion was kept a low key affair and only a few party workers were present to welcome the newly appointed district president.On Wednesday, Punjab BJP president Ashwani Sharma had handed over the command of the Ludhiana BJP president’s post to Singhal, who has replaced Jatinder Mittal.Kamal Chatly and Gurdev Sharma Debi were being considered as the frontrunners for the post. In February, intense lobbying was witnessed from both the leaders during Ashwani Sharma’s visit to Guru Nanak Bhawan.40-YEAR ASSOCIATION WITH PARTY Singhal has been associated with the BJP for nearly 40 years. District media in-charge Satish Kumar said Singhal had started his political career in 1980 from BJP Yuva Morcha. He remained district secretary for two consecutive terms -- once he was nominated as general secretary and served as the district vice-president for six terms.Addressing the party workers, Singhal said he would try his best to strengthen the organisational setup of the party and raise the issues “to expose the misrule of the ruling Congress government in the state.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-bjp-unit-welcomes-newly-appointed-district-president/story-qNWb7bB4YAuMSbhudvSqmJ.html
23-05-2020||Pune||Will mediate between migrant labourers and government, says social activist Medha Patkar||Social activist Medha Patkar said that migrant workers stranded in Pune are facing a lot of difficulties despite the arrangement of Shramik trains and private luxury buses. In the city to help the stranded get back to their home, Patkar spoke to Dheeraj Bengrut when she visited Bharati Vidyapeeth police stationWhat is your analysis of the current situation in Pune and across the state of stranded migrant workers and their travelling arrangements?I started to work on this issue from May 6 from Madhya Pradesh and I am going to various districts in Maharashtra to check and help solve problems of migrant workers. One thing which I see everywhere is that they are not being treated well at most of the places by government agencies, police department and their employers. So they just want to go back to their home, but the issue is travelling. The decision taken by the Modi government to start special trains for these stranded people has been taken very late and they had given permission earlier to private transport vehicles to travel by road. The railway is the best transporting network of the public sector and the migrants were looted by the private sector earlier during the lockdown. They have come on India’s map for the first time as they are an unorganised sector, but are kept unsecured by the government till now. Most of them have not got salaries for the last two months and they are struggling for survival.How are you and your team working to help the stranded in Pune?Since the last three to four days, I am going across Pune and Pimpri- Chinchwad, visiting labour camps, government schools where these stranded have been kept and railway stations and state transport (ST) stands from where they are being sent. One thing is clear that there is a lack of coordination between the government agencies. For example, one train which went to Bihar on Thursday had few seats vacant. Luckily, some people who had registered to travel came to the railway station and were allowed to travel. Similarly for ST buses, for travelling within the state they should now send more buses and help these people.My volunteers and I are now going to each of the police stations in each district of Maharashtra, including Pune. We are collecting data of people who have travelled, those who are still here and want to return to their homes and the technical issues they are facing or what any kind of help they need for survival in the city. We provide them all possible help.What is your plan of action to address the issue?We are collecting data from police stations and other government agencies across the state. We have made formats according to the states, where people want to travel and if they are still stuck here, we will become a mediator between them and the government agencies for their safe travel. This thing will go on for many more days and stranded people which include children, pregnant women and elderly people need to be taken care of. Today we don’t want to look into corruption as of now, but government officials and the police need to be alert and take proper steps.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/will-mediate-between-migrant-labourers-and-government-says-patkar/story-RLEapcxa6AEJUCXu3nAbaP.html

The grocery and grain wholesale market will resume operations from Monday (May 25).Pune APMC administrator BJ Deshmukh said, “The grain and grocery market remained shut since last week as some traders became Covid-19 positive and Poona Merchant Chamber decided to close the market. We are planning to resume operations now by following precautions because the virus spread situation can be checked but will not end in the next couple of days.”The vegetable wholesale market has been shut since the last one-and-a-half-month with many traders coming from containment areas.Though sub-markets at Manjari and Pimpri are functioning, APMC plans to start the Gultekdi main market considering agricultural losses in rural area.Deshmukh said, “A meeting has been called with vegetable traders, hamal panchyat representatives and those related to APMC to take a decision at the earliest.”Deshmukh said, “Pune APMC has decided to provide adequate facilities and follow all precautions related to coronavirus.

23-05-2020||City||HT Readers’ Take: ‘Tough challenge for schools to put Covid-19 safety steps in place if they reopen now’||I’LL PAY THE FEES, BUT WON’T SEND MY CHILD TO SCHOOLJunior and middle schools, even through rotation, should not be opened as students in this age group are vulnerable. They are not only very young, but very immature and naughty as well. Controlling them can be tough. As a mother of a 10-year-old Class 5 student I find it difficult to keep him productively occupied at home or quickly complete his homework online on time. Not being tech savvy I sometimes feel stuck and irritated as well. However, health is wealth so I would prefer to teach my child at home and pay tuition fees on time instead of sending him to school. Money does not matter, but the least I would hope the schools to do is adjust the administration and maintenance charges. The syllabus of the middle schools this year can be adjusted too so that teachers are spared the burden of completing courses quickly.Yasmin D Khosla, PanchkulaFOCUS ON BONDS FORGED DURING THE LOCKDOWNChandigarh is quickly coming to grips with Covid-19, so we should do anything to allow the virus to spread unchecked by being in a hurry to open the schools. Let the schools reopen in a phased manner from July 1 onward. What is important is to build upon the new connect between students, teachers, and parents that was created during the lockdown and made youngsters respect grownups at home and school as they see the elders catching up with their technological skills. Creativity has scored and so has the attendance and participation in online classes. Once schools reopen we much build on the bonds we have strengthened during this period and move ahead to 2021 towards our desired goals.Madhu RD Singh, Ambala CantonmentONLINE CLASSES CANNOT COMPENSATE FOR FACE-TO-FACE INTERACTIONSBeing a grade 12 student, I would request you to consider reopening of schools the need of the hour. We are suffering too. How will we be able to cover the syllabus even though online classes are being held as they aren’t as effective as face to face classes? CBSE also hasn’t issued any clarifications about the reduced syllabus.Arshiya Kishore NO COMPLACENCY WHEN IT COMES TO STUDENTSNo, schools should not be opened immediately as the safety and health of children is of utmost importance. No matter what steps the administration takes, social distancing is next to impossible in our overcrowded classrooms, school buses etc. We can’t even expect children to follow norms strictly, wear masks in the summer and use sanitisers frequently. Handling food during lunch hours is also an issue. For teachers, managing the rush of students while entering and leaving school premises could be a problem. Online teaching should be continued till the pandemic is controlled. One can’t be complacent when it comes to the safety of students as one infected child can act as a super spreader. This is not at all a risk worth taking and administration should seriously take note.Dr Vinay Kapur, Chandigarh DECLARE 2020 THE YEAR OF ‘ONLINE’ EDUCATIONThe present academic session (2020-21) up to Class 12 should once and for all be declared a year for ‘online’ education for the safety and health of children. Will social distancing be possible in classrooms, school buses or while entering and leaving schools? Is use of common toilets advisable? A recess break will also put children’s ability to don and doff masks to test. Smaller children will find it difficult to not touch their masks, which will increase chances of infections, and the summer heat will not make things easy. Opening of schools amidst the pandemic while ensuring social distancing will require investment in terms of sanitising the premises multiple times and running more than one shifts. Rather, schools should devise safe, secure and foolproof methods of conducting exams online. We as parents say a resounding no to opening of schools in the present scenario as the number of cases are increasing. Nothing is worth more than our children’s health.Arpita Kapur, PanchkulaMAKE MASKS A PART OF SCHOOL UNIFORMSAll schools should be allowed to open according to schedule with an undertaking that social distancing will be maintained and masks made compulsory and a part of the school uniform. Remaining confined at home for a long period can lead to mental and other health problems.TBS BediMEDICAL HELP NOT AVAILABLE IN MANY SCHOOLSKeeping in view the present conditions it is not advisable to open the schools immediately as the safety of students is likely to be compromised. As many schools might be unable to provide immediate medical help in the present scenario they should act wisely and wait for the right opportunity to open.SK Gupta, MohaliCAN CHILDREN OBSERVE STRICT DISTANCING, SAFETY NORMS?Decision of school opening is a very crucial decision as it could put the lives of children at risk. Let’s imagine a scenario in which a school opens and child gets infected. He or she could infect others and they in turn could transmit it to their family members. Now let’s go with the theory of social distancing and hygiene – do you think many students will be able to follow safety norms, especially those in primary classes? Definitely not. Studies are an important part of a student’s life no doubt, but lives matter too. Schools should remain closed till the situation improves.Himanshi SehgalDON’T ALLOW ANY FUNCTIONSYes, there should be no problem in reopening schools, but it should only be done if school managements take the responsibility of strictly following social distancing and other safety norms. Protection of children should be the topmost priority. Schools must ensure children are checked at the gates for temperature. Shift systems allowing batches to come in on alternate days can be followed. No gathering of any kind such as seminars and other functions should be allowed.Prabhjot Nagpal, ZirakpurMANAGING SOCIAL DISTANCING A CHALLENGEOpening schools might result in more children getting infected with Covid-19. It will be a challenge to manage social distancing and taking other precautionary measures in schools given the crowded classrooms. Parents will also not want to expose their children to risks now.Saikrit Gulati, ChandigarhPARENTS SHOULD BE CONSULTEDThe director, school education, should discuss the issue with teachers and parents to find a workable solution, keeping in mind that the health of the students is paramount. The health department should also maintain records of infections among the students.Usha Verma, ChandigarhINVOLVE STUDENTS, TEACHERS IN DECISION-MAKINGThe education department of the Chandigarh administration must draw up a comprehensive plan involving principals and senior students from government and private schools to reopen. In fact, teachers and senior students besides other staff members should be taught and trained on a war footing to ensure that precautions such as sanitisers, hand-wash, masks, etc are used and social distancing norms followed. School principals should have a daily briefing (on what to do) every day and debriefing (identifying and removing shortcomings) with teachers and senior students to ensure safeguards remain in place and improve every day. Dr SS Bhatti, ChandigarhONLINE CLASSES TEMPORARY SOLUTIONAll the stakeholders in education should prepare to reopen schools in a phased manner. However, new safety measures ranging from adequate ventilation of classrooms to placing desks six feet apart to ensure social distancing norms, wearing masks and only allowing students of a particular age to attend classes should be adopted. Many offices and companies are resuming work gradually, so why leave schools behind? Online classes are a temporary solution because in traditional classrooms individuals learn many life skills. Being in the peer group is very important for the emotional growth of children. Continuing online classes for long time can lead to certain behavioural issues which might adversely impact the mental well-being of students.Jasleen Kaur, ChandigarhSCHOOLS NOT EQUIPPED TO PUT SAFETY MEASURES IN PLACEWill our current system be ready to take on the risk of opening schools? Do institutes have the wherewithal to manage transport, classrooms with social distancing for designated strength of students; adequate staff strength and health services? Analysing all of this will indicate that we are not ready as yet to take on the risk of opening schools.Om Prakash Negi REVISE SYLLABUS, MAKE IT SHORTERUsually at this time of the year schools are normally closed for summer holidays before the new session and to protect students from the ill-effects of intense heat wave conditions. Now, with the Covid-19 outbreak, it is not in any way justifiable to open schools. Revised shorter syllabus with online teaching sessions and staggered group home tuitions with health advisories adhered to are some safety measures school managements can opt for the completion of course work .Anil Vinayak, Amritsar CUT SHORT SCHOOL TIMINGSIf schools have to be opened then only senior classes should be allowed. Classes can be segregated and students with roll numbers ending with odd and even numbers should come on alternate days. The whole school, classes, benches, walls labs and school buses should be sanitised and school hours cut short. Students entering schools should be checked for fever with staff present at gates handing out masks to those not wearing them. Their hands and bags should be sanitised. No first term exams should be conducted up to Class 8.Sonia AryaWAIT FOR CITIES TO REPORT ZERO CASESBeing a student I want to suggest that schools should not open until our cities or states record zero cases because many students coming from containment zones will put the lives of others at risk as implementing social distancing norms in institutes could be a problem. According to me, teachers, too, might not be able to monitor larger classes and see if students are following other safety precautions. I feel online classes are for our benefit as there is less consumption of paper, students are getting used to technology and can easily make notes on their smartphone. One is also comfortable while sitting at home and studying. Fuel too is saved as students don’t have to be dropped off to or picked up from school.Nikhil Sharma, LudhianaCHILDREN’S STUDIES SHOULD NOT BE AFFECTEDI firmly believe that schools should be reopened for Classes 12 and 10, requiring batches to attend on alternate days. As it’s certain that development of a vaccine against Covid-19 will take a considerable amount of time, we should take strict measures to ensure that children’s studies are not affected.Sanjay Singla||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/tough-challenge-for-schools-to-put-covid-19-safety-steps-in-place-if-they-reopen-now/story-N7f98PA3HPhSbDFGhaw8PP.html

Most of the passengers had visited the US on tourist visas, but their trip soon turned into a nightmare after the outbreak hit the American soil.“We are lucky to be back in our homeland. The Covid situation in the USA was such, every passing day was becoming a nightmare,” said one of the passengers. This, he said, was a mutual feeling among them.On touchdown, all passengers were medically screened for symptoms. They were sent to institutional quarantine for 14 days at their respective locations.Of the 100 passengers, five are from Mohali, 12 from Haryana, 16 from Himachal Pradesh, nine from Chandigarh, two from Uttarakhand and the rest from various districts of Punjab.Sukhdarshan Singh, a native of Hoshiarpur in Punjab, who went to New York with his family in February, said, “I cannot express the happiness I felt on reaching my homeland. We were not sure if we would be able to come back. The situation in the US was pretty bad and we really wanted to leave.”“I was homesick and wanted to come back desperately. Every passing day in the US was becoming a nightmare for me. The way the Indian government acted proactively is commendable,” said Priya, who is from Patiala and had gone to New York on a tourist visa in March.‘MISMANAGED ADMINISTRATION’Another resident of Amritsar, Gagandeep Kaur, who visited Maryland on a fellowship in December last year, said, “We are happy to be back, but there was complete mismanagement on the part of the district administration. Our flight landed at 1.30pm, but we were at the airport till 5pm. I will be reaching Amritsar at 9pm. On the other hand, the US consular officials were very cooperative,” she said.Mohali civil surgeon Dr Manjit Singh, who led the screening and medical examination of the passengers, said all were asymptomatic.District nodal officer Dr Harmandeep Kaur Brar said the passengers will be quarantined at government facilities in their respective states for 14 days as a precautionary measure.MORE RETURN FROM CANADA, MALAYSIABesides the nine passengers from US, 16 other Chandigarh residents returned from Canada and Malaysia on Friday.As many as 13 residents arrived from Canada after landing at the Delhi and Amritsar airports, while three from Malaysia arrived at the Amritsar airport.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/stuck-in-us-for-two-months-100-tourists-flown-back-to-chandigarh/story-jYCkhR6kLFnMXiV3FuIlVM.html
23-05-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh to celebrate Eid at home this year||The Muslim community of the city has pledged to celebrate Eid-al-Fitr at home this year in order to promote social distancing and prevent the spread of coronavirus disease.The decision was taken at a meeting held by the representatives of various city mosques and UT director general of police (DGP) Sanjay Baniwal at Jama Masjid in Sector 20 on the last Friday of the holy month of Ramadan.Eid-al-Fitr will be celebrated on May 25 this year. It was decided that mosques will be kept closed and devotees will offer namaz from home. Kari Shamsher, head of the Sector 45 mosque, said this was the first time since Independence that mosques in the city will remain closed on Eid. Maulana Ajmal Khan, head of the Sector 20 masjid, added that the message to stay home will be given during the daily azaan.To pay their respects to the heads, the police offered 700 kilos of vermicelli (sewiyan) to the community. The mosque heads returned the gesture by offering bouquets to DGP Baniwal and UT deputy inspector general of police (DIG) Omvir Singh Bishnoi.During the entire month of Ramadan, the mosques in Chandigarh remained closed and devotees were asked to offer prayers at home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-to-celebrate-eid-at-home-this-year/story-VTXAoMRQhyXaEcbmeSRqYM.html
23-05-2020||Pune||Labour migration delays Metro and highway projects in Pune||The work on metro and the highway connecting Katraj to Navale bridge, two major development projects in Pune, is hit after many migrant labourers left for their native places because of the Covid-19 (coronavirus) spread.Though Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation Limited (Maha-Metro) got the nod from Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) to resume work and complete the pre-monsoon operations, the former face at least 50 per cent workforce shortage.“The lockdown halted the metro work in the city and now we face labour shortage with migrant labourers returning to their hometowns. During the lockdown, we had 2,843 labourers working with the contractor. With 1,500 workers leaving for their hometowns, we are left with only around 1,300 to work on-site,” said Hemant Sonawane, general manager, public relations Maha-Metro.He said, “It is essential for us to complete some of the crucial work on the riverfront and the riverbed before the monsoon. Hence, we have diverted all the remaining manpower to work on these critical areas and on junctions with almost no traffic.”Sonawane said that while the departure of labourers has caused a setback, contractors are revising plans to ensure that work deadlines are met.Atul Gadgil, Maha-Metro director, said, “We are managing with only 25 per cent manpower. Only pre-monsoon related critical works are going on. Earlier, our deadline for trial run was April 2020, but now it depends on the availability of labour and other administrative related things.”According to Gadgil, Maha-Metro has decided to demolish two foot-over-bridges (FOBs) located at Kharalwadi and Vallabhnagar after Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) okayed the task. PMC has suggested demolition of FOB at Nal stop, but a decision is awaited.PMC approved the work of six-laning of a stretch from Navale bridge to Katraj in November 2019, but the Covid-19 crisis has delayed the project.Although the Public Works Department (PWD) began a trial patch of 300 metres, with two layers of work done for the road widening from the Navale bridge side, work came to a halt due to the coronavirus pandemic.Thirty labourers plus engineers and contractors were at work on site, but many workers left for their native places leaving the site with only engineers, said Rahul Kulkarni, assistant engineer, PWD for National Highway.“If only we had received the permission to begin work earlier than April 15, 2020, we could have begun work as labourers would have been there. We have machinery on-site, but no drivers or operators,” he said.Kulkarni also raised his apprehension about whether the labourers would return to work after undergoing 14-day quarantine. “We had approached PMC five months ago for permissions from tree authority to transplant or cut 232 trees along the service road from Navale bridge to Katraj. We are still awaiting a hearing, while the forest department has given us the go ahead,” Kulkarni said.Since the road is part of the urban stretch and not a complete highway, there are several utility lines which have still not been moved, he added.The PWD official is confident that the project will be finished within deadline after an extension of six months was announced by the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/labour-migration-delays-metro-and-highway-projects/story-MMXzfW1uokWsp7yg4USMNJ.html
23-05-2020||Delhi||Covid-19: Delhi govt demarcates 14 new containment zones, total goes up to 92||The Delhi government has demarcated 14 new containment zones across south-west, north, north-west and south-east districts, government official said on Friday.Six new containment zones were added in the south-west district after 39 Covid-19 cases were reported in a cluster from Vikaspuri, Palam and Kanganheri village in the last few days.According to officials of the south-west district administration, of the six containment zones, three are located in Vikaspuri, two in Palam and one in Kanganheri village.The newly added containment zones are Deep Enclave Part-2, Vikaspuri; DG3 Block, Vikas Puri; Kanganheri Village; Puran Nagar, Palam Colony; F-Block, Vikaspuri; and Gali number 46, Sadh Nagar, Palam Colony .“Four Covid-19 cases were reported from Deep Enclave, seven from DG3 block Vikaspuri, eight from Kanganheri village, four from Puran Nagar, eight from F-block Vikaspuri and eight more from Sadh Nagar in Palam Colony. These cases were reported in the last 3-4 days. The containment operations were started 2-3 days back,” an official at the office of the district magistrate (south-west) said on Friday.Apart from six containment areas in southwest district, the other new containment zones are EE-Block Jahangirpuri, E2 block Jahangirpuri, Lal Bagh In Azadpur, D-1 block Jahangirpuri, JJ Camp Badli, C-block Mangolpuri, Naharpur Village in northwest district and Sunlight Colony-1 in southeast district.Total number of containment zones is now 92. The government also decontained one area B-Block New Ashok Nagar in east Delhi. The government has till now de-contained 34 areas in the city where no fresh Covid-19 cases have been reported in the last 28 days.Containment zones comprise apartment blocks, gated communities, slums, streets, even entire neighbourhoods. They are complete quarantine zones and no one is allowed to step out even to buy essential goods such as milk, vegetables, fruits etc. All the entry and exit points and even the internal lanes are barricaded. The authorities allow only a number of selected vendors to supply groceries and other essentials to the neighbourhood with the help of RWA and civil defence volunteers.In an order, Rahul Singh, district magistrate (south-west), said that the cluster containment strategy would be to contain the disease within a defined geographical area via the early detection of cases, breaking the chain of transmission and thus preventing its spread to new areas. “This would include geographic quarantine, social distancing measures, enhanced active surveillance, testing suspected cases, isolation of cases, quarantine of contacts and risk communication to create awareness among the public on preventive public health measures,” Singh said.He said all the concerned officials had been directed to ensure the availability of essentials and basic necessities such as food, medical facilities, sanitation, etc.The administration officials said that a buffer zone would be made around each containment zone where banners and posters would be pasted to make people aware of the containment zone.“Medical authorities will test owners and employees working at grocery and medical stores for Covid-19,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/six-new-containment-zones-demarcated/story-0IR0u2l4ypzVsH5K1gJkdN.html

Police on Friday registered a case of robbery and have identified some of the miscreants who robbed the fruit seller, senior officials said.According to the police, the mango seller, who wished to remain anonymous, had come to Shahadra and had put up his cart under a tree, when some cycle rickshaw pullers also arrived at the spot.“The vendor asked the rickshaw pullers to park a little ahead of his cart. This led to an argument between him and the rickshaw pullers, who then called some locals too to the spot for help. On this, the fruit seller fled the area with his cart and left few crates of mangoes behind,” said a senior police officer.Later, a few local residents and passersby stopped by the crates and asked the rickshaw pullers where the fruit vendor was. “On this, the rickshaw pullers apparently told them that they could have the mangoes for free as the seller has fled the area. They even called other locals and told them to take the mangoes,” the police officer said.Soon a crowd gathered at the spot and emptied out the crates and fled with the mangoes.A video of the incident was shared widely on social media on Friday. The video shows at least 30-40 people crowding around the mango crates in violation of all social distancing norms. The traffic on the road was also affected because of locals who had gathered to collect the mangoes.The fruit seller on Friday told police that at least ₹30,000 worth mangoes were looted from morebthan 8-10 crates of fruits he had left behind. Deputy commissioner of police (Shahadra) Amit Sharma said the incident was reported to the police and the mango vendor was tracked. “We assured him of action and on his complaint, we have registered a case of robbery. We have identified 2-3 miscreants and efforts are on to nab them,” the DCP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-shahadra-locals-loot-mangoes-from-a-fruit-seller-s-crates-police-register-case-of-robbery/story-4GZztTnNBudCD7UBNWvTEM.html

Taking inspiration from the civic body many elected members of PMC have now installed such dispensers in slum areas which are falling in their jurisdiction.Ashwini Kadam, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) member has installed ten such dispensers in Sahakarnagar and Padmavati areas.Kadam said, “Many Covid-19 patients are emerging in Taljai and other nearby slums. By considering that we are installing such dispensers near slums and mainly near community toilets.”“We are hoping that PMC should allow considering this expenditure from the ward development fund otherwise we will pay it from our pockets,” said Kadam.Such dispensers have also been installed in Karvernagar area.BJP members Jayant Bhave, Manjushree Khardekar and Dipak Pote have demanded that the PMC should allow installing such hands-free sanitiser dispensers at various crowded places as it would help to contain Covid-19 cases.Elected members from other wards have said that they should be allowed to install such hands-free sanitiser dispensers in their respective areas from their ward development funds.A regional ward officer on anonymity said that they had installed such machines at shelter homes at quarantine centres. “The decision of allowing the expenditure from ward development fund will be taken at senior-level officers,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/elected-members-install-sanitiser-dispensers-near-community-toilets-in-slums/story-GbUw8grLib56kCUqgj6eoL.html
23-05-2020||Pune||Hospital discharges Covid-19 positive patient within 5 days; probe ordered||A private hospital in Pune has readmitted a Covid-19 patient discharged after just five days of admission. The patient tested positive for the Sars-Cov-2 virus. The district administration has now initiated an inquiry into the matter after the woman reached home leading to panic among the residents in her neighbourhood in Rakshewadi, Khed taluka. The hospital maintained that the discharge took place as per the new protocols since the patient was asymptomatic. Dr Bhagwan Pawar, district health officer said the 35-year-old female patient was readmitted to Jehnagir Hospital for treatment. “We are now looking into what could have caused the early discharge. Let the report come out, only then we can speak of any further action if required,” he said. Dr (Col) Satyajit S Gill, medical director at Jehangir Hospital said he was aware of the case and wouldn’t like to comment as a formal enquiry is on.Ayush Prasad, chief executive officer of Pune Zilla Parishad said, “The patient was admitted at Jehangir hospital on May 17 and tested positive for the infection. However, the person was asymptomatic and was discharged by the hospital on May 21 without informing the district administration about the same. When she reached home just five days after admission, the neighbours raised an alarm and we got to know about the case. The woman reached home in a private vehicle even though we have 108 ambulances for patients sent home from the hospital during discharge.”The administration has now constituted a two-member inquiry committee to look into the matter, said Prasad. As of May 21, Pune has had 4,107 Covid-19 positive cases and a total of 227 deaths. The latest Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) discharge policy states that any Covid-19 positive patient with mild or moderate symptoms can be discharged on 10th day if there is no fever three days prior to discharge. The policy does not call for a second re-confirmation test before discharge but states that the person has to compulsorily go for home quarantine for the next seven days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hospital-discharges-covid-19-positive-patient-within-5-days-probe-ordered/story-zGbpeJZvKRIxU37YmutsZJ.html

23-05-2020||Pune||2nd organ donation in Pune during lockdown; liver, kidneys and cornea retrieved from 36-yr-old||The city saw its second organ donation in the on-going lockdown period of the last two months when the family of a brain dead person agreed to donate organs. The liver, kidneys and cornea of the 36-year-old youth were retrieved. Organ donations have seen a drastic fall due to a variety of reasons such as non-availability of organs and vehicle movement restrictions due to which recipients have been unable to travel. Fear of infection has also kept recipients away from hospitals and most surgeries have been cancelled as hospitals are now pre-occupied by Covid-19 patients. The Pune Zonal Transplant Coordination Committee said the 36-year-old from Wanowrie was declared brain dead at Inamdar Hospital following ruptured aneurysm leading to fatal complications. An aneurysm is the enlargement of an artery caused by weakness in the arterial wall. The liver was successfully transplanted on May 20 at Inamdar Hospital on a 48-year-old patient from Wagholi suffering from chronic liver disease with a history of jaundice one year back. The kidneys and cornea were transported to other hospitals. The donor was a cashier by profession.ZTCC Coordinator, Aarti Gokhale said, “This is the second transplant in the city post-lockdown, first which took place on 14 May and the second on Wednesday. One kidney was allocated to Birla Hospital, Pune and the other kidney sent to HN Reliance Hospital Mumbai through the state and regional organ and tissue transport organisation (Sotto/Notto), Mumbai.”The transplant was carried out in a special transplant room to ensure all precautions to prevent any viral infections.Gokhale said it was to the credit of the relatives that they came forward for a noble cause in spite of the Covid-19 crisis to give the greatest gift of life to the needy.“The doctors ensured that they took utmost precautions to avoid the risk of any infection in times of pandemic. Both the recipient and the donor were tested for Covid-19 and once it came negative we started with the surgery in a special transplant room and personal protective equipment for the staff,” Gokhale said. The team of doctors at Inamdar Hospital included liver transplant surgeons Dr Bipin Vibhute and Dr Harshal Rajekar, assistant transplant surgeon Dr Abhijeet Mane , transplant anaesthetists Dr Manish Pathak , Dr Nikhil Hiremath and Dr Sandeep Patil and transplant coordinator Nitin Dushing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/2nd-organ-donation-in-pune-during-lockdown-liver-kidneys-and-cornea-retrieved-from-36-yr-old/story-fuG6IU7CvgqAVSEKw1ezYK.html

He reiterated the government’s stance that markets should play a “decisive role” in the economy.The comments come as China faces mounting pushback from the Trump administration on a range of issues from trade to its handling of the coronavirus outbreak. The White House this week issued a broad critique of China’s economic and military policies in a report to Congress, including accusations of intellectual property theft and economic protectionism.Xi said the virus has put considerable pressure on China’s economy, and the country should seek “development in a world that is increasingly unstable and uncertain” as he listed risks ahead including a deepening global recession, a significant drop in trade investment, financial market turmoil, reduced international interactions and rising geopolitical tensions.Chinese lawmakers on Friday abandoned their usual practice of setting a numerical target for economic growth this year due to the turmoil caused by the virus, breaking with decades of Communist Party planning habits in an admission of the deep rupture that the disease has caused.They’re also using the legislative meeting to pass a bill establishing “an enforcement mechanism for ensuring national security” for Hong Kong, prompting swift pushback from pro-democracy activists in the city and condemnation from American politicians.Xi didn’t address the legislation in his speech, but stressed that China should “stand on the right side of history,” adhere to multilaterism and maintain an “open, cooperative” attitude despite rising protectionism.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xi-jinping-says-china-won-t-return-to-planned-economy-urges-cooperation/story-65egcFbGiMdM6VYp1SVqvJ.html
23-05-2020||World||Remdesivir most beneficial for severely ill Covid-19 patients, say researchers||Remdesivir, an investigation antiviral drug that has proven to be “superior” cure to standard care, is most beneficial for hospitalized patients with severe illness requirement supplemental oxygen supply, researchers behind the trial said in a paper published Friday describing the key findings that have been known for some time.Remdesivir was found to cut median recovery duration to 11 days among patients administered the drug compared to the 15 usually taken by those who were on placebo or standard care, according to an announcement on April 27, which was followed by the US drug regulator granting it emergency use authorization.“Remdesivir was superior to placebo in shortening the time to recovery in adults hospitalized with Covid-19 and evidence of lower respiratory tract infection,” the researchers wrote in a peer-reviewed paper in the New England Journal of Medicine.The US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious diseases (NIAID), which funded the randomized clinical trial, said in a separate announcement on the publication of the details, “Investigators found that remdesivir was most beneficial for hospitalized patients with severe disease who required supplemental oxygen. Findings about benefits in other patient subgroups were less conclusive in this preliminary analysis..Remdesivir is manufactured by Gilead Sciences, Inc, a US pharmaceutical major with a strong presence in India. The firm announced non-exclusive licensing agreements with four Indian companies to manufacture and sell the anti-viral drug, Jubilant Life Sciences Ltd, Cipla Ltd, Hetero Labs Ltd and Mylan NV. The trial of the investigation drug as the best therapeutic available yet for the virus that has killed nearly 339,000 people worldwide and infected more than 5.52 million — 96,082 and and 1.60 million in the United States alone — was conducted among 1,063 Covid-19 patients in 10 countries.The median recovery time for patients administered remdesivir was 11 days, compared 10 15 for those on placebo. Recovery was defined as the patient being discharged from hospital or found to be medically stable enough to be discharged.But noting “high mortality despite the use of remdesivir”. the researchers said, “it is clear that treatment with an antiviral drug alone is not likely to be sufficient. Future strategies should evaluate antiviral agents in combination with other therapeutic approaches or combinations of antiviral agents to continue to improve patient outcomes in Covid-19”.The NIAID started a separate clinical trial earlier this month to evaluate the efficacy of remdesivir in combination with the anti-inflammatory drug baricitinib.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/remdesivir-most-beneficial-for-severely-ill-covid-19-patients-say-researchers/story-IOVU2DFAAC8EAmd5Pp44KL.html

Eleven people on the ground were injured.“The plane was coming very smoothly, 8303 of PIA. My seat was 8F. When it was reaching Jinnah International Airport, the pilot announced that ‘we are landing, fasten your seat belts’. We fastened seat belts. While landing, the plane jolted three times. Then it came on the runway and was on it for a brief time. Then I don’t know what happened, that the pilot adroitly lifted the plane off the ground,” Zubair, who is being treated for burns in a hospital in Karachi, said.“The pilot then flew the plane for 10 or 15 minutes. He again announced that the plane was landing. When this announcement was made, I looked down and it appeared to me that we were (flying) over the Malir Cantonment (area, where it was to land. Then when it was about to land, suddenly…(it crashed),” he said.“When I opened my eyes it was a dark place. I heard cries. I saw some light and tried to walk towards it after undoing my seat belt. There was fire everywhere and no one was visible,” said Zubair from his hospital bed in a video clip circulated on social media.He said when the plane had jolts everyone onboard was reciting Quranic verses. Zubair also gave a statement on Friday in which he said that the plane started wobbling as it approached Karachi airport.“The next moment there was a hard crash and I lost consciousness,” said Zubair, adding that when he woke up there was ‘smoke everywhere’.The hospital administration said that Zubair sustained minor injuries and is currently under treatment at the burns ward. The only other survivor of the crash was Bank of Punjab (BoP) Chief Executive Officer Zafar Masud.He spoke to his mother on the phone and informed her about his health.“As the plane was heading for landing, it hit something and I fell unconscious. When I regained consciousness, I heard people saying ‘yeh zinda hai (he is alive)’. After getting treatment in hospital I spoke to my mother by phone and told her that I am well,” Masud was quoted as having said by a doctor.“Mr Masud departed for Karachi to celebrate Eid with his family. We all at the BoP family are happy that he miraculously survived. He is out of danger and being treated at a Karachi hospital,” said BoP spokesman Asad Zia.“Reached hospital and met Zafar Masud. It is a miracle he survived the crash he fell out of the plane after it broke into pieces. He was rescued by residents and brought to CMH Malir. He is undergoing tests. May Allah give him health,” Senate Vice-Chairman Saleem Mandviwalla tweeted. Masud sustained fractures to his hip and collar bones, the Darul Sehat Hospital’s administration said, adding that there were no burn marks on his body, but only scratches.According to the hospital administration, Masud’s CT scan has been done and his condition is out of danger.

He said that included both the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder.The airline’s chief executive, Arshad Malik, said on Friday the last message received from the pilot indicated there was a technical problem.Another senior civil aviation official told Reuters it appeared the plane had been unable to lower its landing gear for the first approach.Aviation safety experts say air crashes typically have multiple causes.Seconds before the crash, the pilot told air traffic controllers he had lost power from both engines, according to a recording posted on liveatc.net, a respected aviation monitoring website.Airbus said the jet first flew in 2004 and was fitted with engines built by CFM International, co-owned by General Electric and France’s Safran.Pakistan’s prime minister, Imran Khan, announced soon after the crash that there would be an inquiry, and a four-member team was constituted Friday night, according to a notification from the government’s aviation division, seen by Reuters.The team includes three members of the Aircraft Accident and Investigation Board and one from the Pakistan Air Force’s safety board. The team will issue a preliminary statement within a month, the notification says.A statement from the provincial health minister’s office on Saturday put the death toll at 97, with no confirmed deaths on the ground.Army and civil administration personnel were clearing through the debris in the Karachi neighbourhood on Saturday and assisting residents whose homes had been damaged. “Rescue Op in progress ... 25 affected houses cleared, their residents accommodated at various places with assistance of Civil Administration,” the Army said on Twitter.Pakistan only last week resumed domestic flights it had suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with many people travelling for the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Fitr, expected to fall on Sunday or Monday in the country.Friday’s crash is the worst air disaster in Pakistan since 2012, when a Bhoja Air passenger aircraft, a Boeing 737, crashed in Islamabad, killing 127 people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/toll-in-pakistan-plane-crash-climbs-to-97-black-box-found-officials/story-ceyjLRLUZgRVxww2idzriK.html

The industry contributes over £ 5 billion to the UK economy, but the figures are set to be more sober in the current year.According to the Scotch Whisky Association (SWA), the industry has significantly scaled-back operations to protect the safety of workforce during the pandemic. Many have switched to producing hand sanitisers and ethanol to support health services.“All sites that continue to operate have strict social distancing in place to protect employees…87% of production sites are either operating at reduced capacity or have closed entirely,” the SWA says in its latest analysis of the industry.Latest estimates show that a number of companies are either manufacturing hand sanitiser on-site or providing high strength ethanol to other manufacturers, amounting to 14.1 million litres – enough to make around 56 million bottles of hand sanitisers.“The outlook for our sector, as for many others, is uncertain. The collapse of global hospitality, tourism and travel retail sectors is a very real concern and this year we are likely to experience a significant downturn in exports”, the SWA adds.The SWA has long been campaigning for improved market access to India, where Scotch whisky is estimated to account for barely 1% of its 300 million-case market. India imposes 150% tariff, besides other levies by state governments.Prime Minister Boris Johnson has often remarked that Scotch whisky would be one of the top items in talks on a free trade agreement with India after Brexit. In 2019, Scotch whisky exports to India were worth £166 million (19.7% rise on 2018 figures) based on shipping 131 million bottles (16.1% rise on 2018).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/from-scotch-to-sanitiser-covid-19-shakes-stirs-industry/story-Io8lcfijbPTCmkm6bvdlWK.html
23-05-2020||World||Top Boris Johnson aide flouts lockdown curbs, opposition demands resignation||The Boris Johnson government was on Saturday caught in a maelstrom over the prime minister’s chief adviser Dominic Cummings allegedly flouting lockdown rules, with the opposition and others baying for his resignation and cabinet ministers defending him.Not observing curbs imposed due to the coronavirus pandemic has led to at least two high-profile resignations in recent days: epidemiologist Neil Ferguson resigned from a key government committee and Catherine Calderwood as the chief medical officer of Scotland.Cummings, who developed coronavirus symptoms in end-March, drove 264 miles from London to his parents’ house in Durham, north-east England, when official ‘instruction’ to Britons was to stay home, not travel and not visit elderly relatives to prevent spread of the virus.The revelation prompted expressions of fury on social media from people who followed official advice and were for weeks deprived of contact with family and close relatives, even when many were dying. One set of rules for the people and another for those in power, they protested.A Labour spokesman reflected the ennui: “The public have made extraordinary sacrifices during this pandemic and the lockdown. It cannot be one rule for those who set them and another for the British people.”Facing persistent demands for Cummings’ resignation, Downing Street defended his actions, besides cabinet ministers such as chancellor Rishi Sunak, foreign secretary Dominic Raab and others. They said they would not want the opposition to politicise the issue.A Downing Street spokesman said: “Owing to his wife being infected with suspected coronavirus and the high likelihood that he would himself become unwell, it was essential for Dominic Cummings to ensure his young child could be properly cared for”.“His sister and nieces had volunteered to help so he went to a house near to but separate from his extended family in case their help was needed. His sister shopped for the family and left everything outside”.“At no stage was he or his family spoken to by the police about this matter, as is being reported. His actions were in line with coronavirus guidelines. Mr Cummings believes he behaved reasonably and legally.”The Durham police said: “Given the whole ethos of the guidance and regulations which were designed to reduce the spread, regardless of reason, by travelling to County Durham when known to be infected was most unwise”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-boris-johnson-aide-flouts-lockdown-curbs-opposition-demands-resignation/story-IcuHVyMyht97TVtdw7iRxJ.html
23-05-2020||World||US believes Kim Jong Un in Greater Pyongyang area: Report||The U.S. suspects North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is currently in the wider Pyongyang area, according to a report by South Korean daily DongA Ilbo that cites an unidentified Washington government official.The official told the newspaper that the U.S. identified what it believed was Kim’s train in Kangdong County this week, and his car and horse was also seen in the area. The train was spotted through satellite imagery near the coastal city of Wonsan late last month, it said.Kangdong County, located northeast of central Pyongyang City, is also home to a number of factories, including a precision machine plant that Kim visited in 2017.The North Korean leader most recently appeared at a May Day ceremony to mark the opening of a fertilizer plant after he wasn’t seen in public for about three weeks.His absence from state media also came with a flurry of reports last month that prompted questions about his health. South Korean intelligence officials told Yonhap News earlier this month that they saw “no sign” of Kim having undergone a heart surgery.Kim has not been seen in public since his May Day appearance, JoongAng Ilbo reported Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-believes-kim-jong-un-in-greater-pyongyang-area-donga-says/story-Cx40A2ipGOWYGVMMLvazRO.html
23-05-2020||World||Pilots said engines lost power before Airbus crashed in Karachi||A Pakistani airliner crashed into a residential neighborhood of Karachi, killing all but two people on board after pilots reported losing power from both the engines as they prepared for landing.The crash killed 97 travelers on board the state-run Pakistan International Airlines flight, according to Meeran Yousuf, spokeswoman for the provincial health ministry. Two passengers on the the Airbus SE A320 jet, including Zafar Masud, president of the Bank of Punjab, survived.“There was fire everywhere, and everyone was screaming after the crash. I opened my seatbelt, and headed toward the light,” Muhammad Zubair, another survivor, who was sitting in the eighth row, said on a local television broadcast.Eid ul-FitrThe crash happened as the nation went into holidays to celebrate Eid ul-Fitr, the annual Muslim festival. It also resulted in casualties on the ground as the plane plunged into a residential neighborhood, affecting 25 houses.These houses have been cleared and their residents have been sheltered at various places, Pakistan army’s media wing called the Inter Services Public Relations said in a Twitter update on rescue work.Flight PK 8303 from Lahore was carrying 91 passengers and eight crew, Abdul Sattar Khokhar, spokesman of the Civil Aviation Authority, said in an updated tally. Television footage showed cars and homes on fire in the neighborhood near the airport in the nation’s commercial hub. The A320 narrow-body jet first entered service in 2004, and was operated by PIA since 2014, Airbus said.The pilots in Friday’s crash reported losing power from both engines, according to a recording from LiveATC.net, which collects audio feeds from air-traffic controllers.Lost Engines“Sir, we have lost engines,” the pilot said to a controller, according to the LiveATC recording. A distressed call followed about 30 seconds later: “Mayday. Mayday. Mayday.”It’s the second plane crash for the state-owned carrier in less than four years. Pakistan International’s chairman resigned in late 2016, less than a week after the crash of an ATR 42 turboprop killed 47 people.“Although the public sector national carrier’s administration has been mismanaged for decades, this never reflected the engineering competence,” said Burzine Waghmar, a member of the Centre for the Study of Pakistan at SOAS University of London. “PIA’s maintenance and engineering is second to none.”The airline, founded in 1946, suffered as many as 51 safety-related incidents before Friday’s crash, according to data from Aviation Safety Network.The crashed A320 joined the airline six years ago and had a major check in March, according to a statement by the local Civil Aviation Authority. It carried out eight flights since March 21 after the nation restarted flights after easing its coronavirus related lockdown.The jet was previously flown by China Eastern Airlines from 2004 until 2014, the Associated Press reported, citing ownership records. It was then added to PIA’s fleet under a lease from GE Capital Aviation Services, the AP said.Quarantine RulesAirbus said it was providing technical assistance to France’s Bureau d’Enquêtes et d’Analyses and to Pakistani authorities in charge of the investigation. The company is working on getting a team to the crash site, according to a person familiar with the matter.The coronavirus pandemic could complicate things as investigators traveling to the site would have to comply with local quarantine regulations unless they receive special exemptions. Pakistan will also form a four-member body to investigate, and expects to submit an initial statement within a month, its civil aviation authority said.Engine manufacturer CFM International and the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board are monitoring the situation, representatives for both said. CFM is a joint venture of General Electric Co. and Safran SA.The A320’s pilot had reported a “technical fault” before deciding to go around instead of landing, the carrier’s chief Malik said in a video message before visiting the crash site. PIA is trying to determine what the technical fault was, Malik said.A probe into Friday’s incident would be conducted soon, the nation’s Prime Minister Imran Khan said on Twitter.Land Gear Issues?Photos purportedly taken of the plane after its initial attempt at landing appear to show damage to the underside of both engines, suggesting that its landing gear wasn’t down. The photos were posted on the Aviation Herald website.One possibility is that the plane ran out of fuel while attempting to circle back to the runway to land, said Jeff Guzzetti, the former head of accident investigations at the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration.The plane clearly had enough power to climb again, so the engines were working in spite of any damage they may have sustained, said Guzzetti. Pictures from the scene show there was a fire, but it appears to have been less severe than what would be expected in a typical crash, which would suggest they were low on fuel, he said.Guzzetti cautioned that it’s too early to say anything for certain. “You certainly don’t want to rule anything out,” he said. “We don’t know enough at this point.”Pakistan recently began resuming domestic flights last week, starting with 20% of capacity. The crash comes at a terrible time for airlines, which are staring at a $314 billion loss in ticket sales this year, as the Coronavirus outbreak idles 70% of global capacity, IATA has said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pilots-said-engines-lost-power-before-airbus-crashed-in-karachi/story-sy60TnQF1pHl2cflSPIHXM.html

None of the live babies tested positive for Covid-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus.The study, published in the American Journal of Clinical Pathology, found that 12 of the women, or 80%, had a type of injury that can impair blood flow from the mother to the fetus called vascular malperfusion. Six of them, or 40%, had blood clots in the placenta. An historical comparison group showed vascular malperfusion in 55% of patients and placental blood clots in 9% of cases. The research involved women who gave birth at Northwestern Medicine Prentice Women’s Hospital between March 18 and May 5.“These findings support that there might be something clot-forming about coronavirus, and it’s happening in the placenta,” Dr. Jeffrey Goldstein, a Northwestern pathologist and study author told Reuters. He said issues with placental blood flow could lead to fetal growth restriction, low levels of amniotic fluid or even fetal demise.There have been reports of blood clots in adult COVID-19 patients that caused strokes.In this study, however, none of the 15 live babies appear to have any health problems. Goldstein said it makes sense to continue to follow babies born to coronavirus-infected mothers to see if they face any difficulties.The placenta is the first organ to form in fetal development. It acts as the fetus’ lungs, gut, kidneys and liver, taking oxygen and nutrients from the mother’s blood stream and exchanging waste.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pregnant-women-with-covid-19-show-placenta-injury-in-small-study/story-LGR3gKI77YMdhQdRJftc6K.html

Cyclone Amphan, the strongest to hit the region in nearly two decades, made landfall on Wednesday evening. It has killed over 85 people and directly affected around 1.5 crore others and destroyed more than 10 lakh houses in India. In Bangladesh, it has killed at least 22 people and left many displaced in the coastal areas. Guterres on Friday took to Twitter to express sadness over the loss of lives and destruction. “I’ve been following developments in Bangladesh and India after #CycloneAmphan made landfall Wednesday. Deeply saddened to hear lives have been lost and millions more have been affected. UN staff are on the ground assessing damage & emergency needs,” the UN chief said in a tweet. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has announced an advance interim assistance of Rs 1,000 crore for West Bengal and Rs 500 crore for Odisha. The UN Country Team in India has said that Cyclone Amphan, which has ravaged areas in West Bengal, is now considered even more destructive than Cyclone Aila, which slammed the region in May 2009.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-chief-following-cyclone-amphan-situation-in-india-saddened-by-loss-of-lives/story-xNVceH87MqZxOECc9Q8jeK.html

Following this, seven other prisoners and six of prison staff members suspected of having contracted the virus were tested on May 13. Among them, six prisoners and one staff member were found infected.By May 15, the number of infected inmates increased to 40 while another staff member tested positive for Covid-19. The very next day, the number of infected prisoners jumped to 204 and that of the staff members to 34. Later, on May 17, 32 more prisoners were diagnosed with Covid-19.Pakistan recorded over 52,000 Covid cases on Saturday, with Sindh reporting 20,883 cases, the maximum among other provinces.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-infections-surpass-300-in-pakistan-prison/story-avPB5VxpyKbVOyDHyalW1L.html
23-05-2020||World||600% increase in malicious emails amid Covid-19 crisis: UN Official||The UN disarmament chief warned Friday that cyber crime is on the rise, with a 600% increase in malicious emails during the Covid-19 pandemic.Izumi Nakamitsu told an informal meeting of the UN Security Council that the coronavirus crisis is moving the world toward increased technological innovation and online collaboration. But she said “there have also been worrying reports of (cyber) attacks against health care organizations and medical research facilities worldwide.”The high representative for disarmament affairs said growing digital dependency has increased the vulnerability to cyberattacks, and it is estimated that one such attack takes place every 39 seconds.According to the International Telecommunication Union, she said, nearly 90 countries are still only at the early stages of making commitments to cybersecurity.Nakamitsu said the threat from misusing information and communications technology “is urgent.”But she said there is also good news, pointing to some global progress at the United Nations to address the threats by a group of government expert who developed 11 voluntary non-binding norms of responsible state behavior in the use of such technology.Estonia’s Prime Minister Juri Ratas, whose country holds the Security Council presidency and organized Friday’s meeting, said the need for “a secure and functioning cyberspace” is more pressing than ever. He condemned cyberattacks targeting hospitals, medical research facilities and other infrastructure, especially during the pandemic.“Those attacks are unacceptable,” Ratas said. “It will be important to hold the offenders responsible for their behavior.”Russia did not attend the informal council meeting broadcast online, which was the centerpiece of Estonia’s council presidency. The other 14 council nations did, along with about 50 other nations that spoke.Russia’s UN Mission said in a statement on its website that it did not attend because Estonia, the UK and the US violated “the established practice” that all council members attend informal meetings “regardless of whether they approve or disapprove its topic.”The three countries did not attend a Russian-sponsored informal meeting on Crimea on Thursday. All three oppose Russia’s seizure and annexation of Crimea from Ukraine.In March, the U.S., U.K., and Estonia accused Russia’s military intelligence of conducting cyberattacks against the government and media websites in Georgia, calling the attacks part of “a continuing pattern of reckless ... cyberoperations against a number of countries” that “clearly contradict Russia’s attempts to claim it is a responsible actor in cyberspace.”Estonia was the target of a massive three-week cyberattack during a dispute with Russia in 2007 over Estonia’s removal of the Bronze Soldier Soviet war memorial from the center of the capital, Tallinn. The attack disabled the websites of government ministries, political parties, newspapers, banks and companies.Since then, Estonia has built its cyber defenses and become one of the most wired societies in Europe and a pioneer in the development of “e-government.” Being highly dependent on computers, it is also highly vulnerable to cyberattack.Russia has taken on the issue of cybercrime at the United Nations, and won General Assembly approval in December for a resolution that will start the process of drafting a new international treaty to combat cybercrime over objections from the European Union, the US and others. They said it would undermine international cooperation to combat cybercrime.“We have witnessed malicious cyber activity that appears designed to undermine the United States and our international partners’ efforts to protect, assist, and inform the public during this global pandemic,” Acting US Deputy Ambassador Cherith Norman Chalet told Friday’s meeting.She warned that actions hampering hospital and health care systems that perform critical services “could have deadly results.”Russia’s UN Mission posted the speech it would have delivered at the council meeting, which says “the world literally finds itself now before a choice between global cyber peace or cyberwarfare.”Russia said the Covid-19 pandemic introduced dramatic changes to people’s lives and showed that the world’s dependence on information and telecommunication technologies “is now unprecedented.”Moscow accused an “`elite’ minority,” whose members it did not identify, of actively pursuing “the militarization of cyberspace by pushing forward the concept of `preventive military cyber strikes,’ including against critical infrastructure.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/600-increase-in-malicious-emails-amid-covid-19-crisis-un-official/story-YAcXHHIuDsxQ7l5KaIerEJ.html
23-05-2020||World||IBM cuts jobs around US as new CEO looks for revival||IBM told the Wall Street Journal it is laying off an undisclosed number of workers across the US Covid-19IBM representatives didn’t return numerous calls and emails Friday to confirm the job cuts, which were also reported by Bloomberg.The already-struggling tech giant’s new CEO Arvind Krishna warned investors last month of uncertainty caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, saying the company made a “tough decision” to withdraw revenue projections for the rest of 2020. The Armonk, New York company reported a 3.4% revenue decline in the January-March quarter from the same time last year, blaming it in part on how the coronavirus outbreak was affecting sales.The Journal said IBM’s job cuts could number in the thousands, citing an unnamed person familiar with the company’s plans. IBM had about 352,600 employees worldwide as of December 31, according to its annual report. Krishna said in April that more than 95% of them were working remotely.It is the latest example of the pandemic hitting the tech industry, even as demand rises for online services and computing power to help home-bound people work, learn and entertain themselves online. Hewlett Packard Enterprise announced planned cutbacks Thursday that are likely to cost jobs and reduce salaries.These would be IBM’s first big layoffs under Krishna, who on April 6 replaced outgoing CEO Ginni Rometty. Rometty remains IBM’s executive chairwoman through the end of the year.Krishna said in April at his first quarterly earnings call as CEO that the company will continue to eliminate software and services that don’t align with IBM’s top two focus areas for growth: cloud computing and artificial intelligence.Once a household name for its personal computers, IBM shed its PC business in 2005 and has since become focused on supplying software services to big businesses, governments and other organizations. It worked to strengthen its cloud computing business under Rometty but has struggled to compete with top cloud rivals Amazon, Microsoft and Google.Krishna spoke optimistically earlier in May about how the 110-year-old company could weather the pandemic.“The fact that IBM has been here before gives me perspective and confidence,” Krishna said at the Think conference for IBM clients and developers, held remotely this year. “I believe history will look back on this as the moment when the digital transformation of business and society suddenly accelerated.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ibm-cuts-jobs-around-us-as-new-ceo-looks-for-revival/story-yDh94P0onDls8C3zt0fujK.html

The topic surfaced at a meeting of senior officials representing the top national security agencies after accusations from the administration that Russia and China are conducting low-yield nuclear tests, the Washington Post said. The meeting, however, did not conclude with any agreement to conduct a nuclear test. A decision was ultimately made to take other measures in response to threats posed by Russia and China and avoid a resumption of testing, the report added.

23-05-2020||World||Covid-19 vaccine developed in China shows promising results in early human trials: Report||Researchers say that a vaccine developed in China, that has reached phase one clinical trial appears to be safe and may protect people from the coronavirus, according to a report in New York Times. The report, based on a Lancet study, cited an early-stage trial conducted by researchers at several laboratories involving 108 participants aged between 18 and 60. In the trial, those who received a single dose of the vaccine produced certain immune cells, called T cells, within two weeks while the antibodies needed for immunity peaked at 28 days after the inoculation. As the coronavirus pandemic shows no sign of abating with the global cases of Covid-19, the disease caused by coronavirus surpassing 5.2 million and deaths crossing 338,000, the race to find a cure for it including a drug and a vaccine has also gained momentum. Governments, drugmakers and researchers are working on around 100 vaccine programmes but experts say that a safe and effective vaccine could take 12 to 18 months to develop. The vaccine in China reported on Friday was made with a virus, called Ad5, modified to carry genetic instructions into a human cell, says the NYT report. The cell begins making a coronavirus protein; the immune system learns to recognize the protein and attack it, in theory preventing the coronavirus from ever gaining a foothold.The final results of the trial will be evaluated in six months, the study said, reports news agency PTI. “These results represent an important milestone. The trial demonstrates that a single dose of the new adenovirus type 5 vectored COVID-19 (Ad5-nCoV) vaccine produces virus-specific antibodies and T cells in 14 days,” said study co-author Wei Chen from the Beijing Institute of Biotechnology. Based on the results, Chen said the vaccine is a potential candidate for further investigation, reports PTI. However ,the NYT report said only a subset of people in the new trial produced neutralizing antibodies to the coronavirus, the kinds of molecules needed for immunity. People between 45 and 60 years of age also produced weaker immune responses following vaccination than younger participants. Also, the results of the trial of Chinese vaccine are based on data from a short period and it is not clear how long its effect may last. The participants in the trials also experienced many side effects depending on the potency of the dose administered.Those with the highest dose showed the most side-effects with about 80 percent of the participants reporting at least one side effect, all expected with a viral vaccine, experts said. Almost half of the participants reported fever, fatigue and headaches, and about one in five had muscle pain, the NYT reported.Also, scientists, including those from the Beijing Institute of Biotechnology in China said further research is needed to confirm whether the vaccine protects against SARS-COV-2 infection, PTI reported.Of the other vaccine trials around the world, US-based Moderna Inc announced earlier this week that its vaccine appeared to be safe and effective, based on results from eight people in its trial.Developers of a Covid-19 vaccine at the University of Oxford in UK described their efforts as progressing “very well”, moving to the next phase after completing 1,000 immunisations by its candidate-vaccine on healthy human adults. The human trials were first initiated in April. The next phase, the second in the typical three phases of trials that a vaccine goes through, involves enrolling up to 10,260 adults and children to assess the immune response to the vaccine in people of different ages and assess if there is a variation.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-vaccine-developed-in-china-shows-promising-results-in-early-human-trials-report/story-7Qi30vaXMZ0YWRiGdRDpFJ.html
23-05-2020||World||How China pounced on Hong Kong while Covid-19 overwhelmed the world||Dennis Kwok was with his two children, hiking through the lush jungles of Hong Kong’s Victoria Peak in April, when he realized how far China was willing to go to quell dissent in the former British colony.Kwok’s phone lit up with texts and calls asking about an alarming and unprecedented statement from China’s top agency overseeing Hong Kong. It said Kwok -- an opposition lawmaker who was participating in a filibuster effort in the city’s elected legislature -- may have committed misconduct and violated his oath of office, offenses that could cost him his seat.“It ruined the day with my kids,” Kwok, 42, said. But the London-trained lawyer also realized that “something fundamental had changed” in the months while Hong Kong protesters had withdrawn from the streets to escape the coronavirus.“The Communist Party pulled back the curtain,” he said.This week, China intervened even more dramatically. President Xi Jinping’s government announced Thursday that the National People’s Congress would write sweeping legislation into Hong Kong law to criminalize the harshest criticism of China and the ruling party. Although details remain secret, a similar security bill withdrawn in 2003 carried life sentences and drew massive street protests. All could potentially become law without a local vote.The move represents the biggest challenge yet to the “one country, two systems” framework set up to guarantee Hong Kong’s liberal institutions and capitalist financial system after its return to Chinese rule in 1997. While the option of handing down such national security legislation has been in the city’s Basic Law since the handover, Xi’s predecessors avoided exersing it due to widespread opposition and concern about damaging the city’s reputation as a legal safe haven.‘Disastrous Proposal’Now, China has decided to ignore critics such as Secretary of State Michael Pompeo, who indicated Friday that the “disastrous proposal” could lead the U.S. to reconsider the city’s special trade status. The action raises the stakes for another round of violent and destructive street protests ahead of legislative elections in which “pan-democrats” like Kwok were hoping to gain their first majority.“The Chinese have taken off the gloves in Hong Kong,” said Bonnie Glaser, who directs the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington and has advised the U.S. government. “Surrounding the elections in September, there could be massive protests again.”Hong Kong’s Beijing-appointed leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, attempted to reassure the international community on Friday night that the city would remain a “very free society, where freedom of expression, freedom of protest, freedom of journalism, will stay.” The Hong Kong branch of China’s foreign ministry said the provisions were necessary to ensure social stability and would affect “very few” people.Hong Kong’s financial markets and independent courts have long provided global companies, entrepreneurs and the Chinese elite with a lucrative refuge from the mainland’s high taxes, capital controls and party-run justice system. Moreover, Beijing gained international prestige by tolerating a raucous democracy under its authority, an arrangement that party leaders hoped would also appeal to self-ruled Taiwan across the South China Sea.All that began to change when Hong Kong erupted in historic protests last year to block Lam’s attempt to pass legislation that would have allowed the extradition of criminal suspects to the mainland. Demonstrators paralyzed the city for months, shutting down shops and keeping tourists away as they criticized China and demanded free elections to replace Lam.Protesters chanted “Liberate Hong Kong! Revolution of our times!” in largely peaceful marches that drew more than a million people. One band of radicals broke into the Legislative Council on the handover’s anniversary, ransacking the chamber and defacing the city’s emblem.Meanwhile, U.S. officials including President Donald Trump expressed support for the activists, fanning Beijing’s suspicions of foreign efforts to exploit its domestic weakness. Many pro-establishment figures put the blame on the failure of Hong Kong’s government to reform the city’s colonial-era security laws referring to “Her Majesty” with measures to protect the Chinese state. None of Lam’s predecessors had tried since the 2003 effort failed.“Beijing has clearly run out of patience with the Hong Kong government’s unsuccessful attempts to end the protest movement by enacting its own draconian security legislation,” said Hugo Brennan, principal Asia analyst for Verisk Maplecroft in London. “The proposed national security law is likely to prove a death knell for the ‘one country, two systems’ model and the facade of Hong Kong autonomy.”The April 14 statement from the Hong Kong & Macau Affairs Office accusing Kwok of violating his oath and other “sleazy tactics” was just one of a series of steps toward a more interventionist approach by Beijing. The shift was first signaled in an October communique from a Communist Party Central Committee meeting led by Xi, and quickly followed up a legislative official’s pledge to “exercise all powers vested in the central government” over Hong Kong.Later, as Hong Kong and the rest of the world were focused on a deadly new pneumonia in central China just named Covid-19, Xi put someone in charge with a record of executing controversial policies. On Feb. 13, China named Xia Baolong to head the Hong Kong & Macau Affairs Office atop a newly revamped reporting structure that created a clear chain of command from Hong Kong to Beijing.The choice of Xia, a former close aide to Xi, set off alarm bells. In 2014 and 2015, he had overseen a crackdown on Christian churches in eastern Zhejiang province, in which crosses were cut from the roofs of houses of worship. Meanwhile, Luo Huining, a cadre known for executing Xi’s anti-corruption campaign, was appointed to head China’s top agency in Hong Kong, the Liaison Office.It was Xia who briefed Hong Kong representatives Thursday night in Beijing on the plan to pass the new security law before the end of next week.“They’ve got two guys who are totally not familiar with Hong Kong issues, and who have governed provinces in China in a heavy-handed way and think they can do the same in Hong Kong,” said Kwok, who has a law degree from King’s College, University of London. “They want to use a new strategy of terror, fear, attacks, criticism, direct intervention.”In April, as Hong Kong’s own coronavirus outbreak began to subside and the city’s old political fights resumed, the two officials turned their attention to the gridlocked Legislative Council. There pro-democracy lawmakers including Kwok had used a quirk in the rules to stop action by the body’s agenda-setting House Committee.The statement from the Hong Kong & Macau Affairs Office accusing lawmakers of crimes and demanding action was seen by some lawyers as a violation of constitutional provisions banning interference by Chinese agencies. The Liaison Office responded that the restriction didn’t apply because the Basic Law was approved by the National People’s Congress and the parliament had created the agencies to oversee Hong Kong.It was a sign of things to come. Days later, Hong Kong police arrested 15 high-profile democracy activists including 81-year-old Martin Lee -- often called the city’s “Father of Democracy” -- on charges related to participating in illegal rallies. Several of those arrested were frequent targets of Chinese state media criticism, even though they were seen as having little role in the more recent “leaderless” protests.Last Election?“All these gestures are to show: ‘We’re in control. We’re going to crack down. You guys have to respect the parameters set down by Beijing and that political struggle is futile,’” said Joseph Cheng, a retired political science professor and veteran democracy activist.Events accelerated in mid-May as pro-establishment lawmakers, aided by security guards, seized control of the House Committee from Kwok and moved to pass legislation criminalizing disrespect for the Chinese national anthem. On May 15, a police watchdog group exonerated the city’s police force from accusations of using excessive force against protesters, despite international criticism.The moves have left Hong Kong’s pro-democracy camp reeling just six months after winning 85% of seats in local council elections. Now, many government critics fear the new laws could be used to disqualify candidates for Legislative Council seats or expel winners after the vote -- actions the government has taken repeatedly in recent years.For Kwok, the statements showed he’s a top target. “We need to focus on the September election and tell people, ‘This may be the last election for Hong Kong,’” he said. “People really need to come out to vote.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-china-pounced-on-hong-kong-while-covid-19-overwhelmed-the-world/story-9tmIT99mtYSAh3A1D1HZAM.html
23-05-2020||World||‘I went towards the light’, says Pakistan plane crash survivor||One of the two survivors of Friday’s plane crash in a crowded residential district of Karachi in Pakistan said he saw fire all around him and could hear screams as the aircraft went down.The Pakistan International Airlines Airbus jet with 99 people aboard crashed on Friday afternoon after twice trying to land at the airport, a witness said.Sindh health minister Azra Pechuho said while speaking to reporters late on Friday night that 82 bodies have been recovered from the site of the crash. It is, however, unclear if the deceased were all on board the flight or include residents of the area where the crash took place.The Airbus A320 was flying from the eastern city of Lahore to Karachi in the south with 91 passengers and eight crew, civil aviation authorities said, just as Pakistan was resuming domestic flights in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. The crash happened on the eve of Eid when Pakistanis travel to visit relatives. Fire, screamsTwo passengers survived, including Zafar Masood, president of the Bank of Punjab, a Sindh provincial government spokesperson said. Bank of Punjab said Masood had suffered fractures but was “conscious and responding well”. The other survivor, engineer Muhammad Zubair, told Geo News the pilot came down for one landing, briefly touched down, then took off again. After around 10 more minutes of flying, the pilot announced to passengers he was going to make a second attempt, then crashed as he approached the runway, Zubair said from his bed in Civil Hospital Karachi.“All I could see around was smoke and fire,” Zubair said.“I could hear screams from all directions. Kids and adults. All I could see was fire. I couldn’t see any people – just hear their screams,” he added.“I opened my seat belt and saw some light – I went towards the light. I had to jump down about 10 feet to get to safety.”‘Mayday’Smoke billowed from the scene where flight PK 8303 came down at about 2:45pm (0945 GMT). Twisted fuselage lay in the rubble of multi-storey buildings as ambulances rushed through chaotic crowds.“The aeroplane first hit a mobile tower and crashed over houses,” witness Shakeel Ahmed said near the site, a few kilometres short of the airport.Seconds before the crash, the pilot told air traffic controllers he had lost power from both engines, according to a recording posted on liveatc.net, a respected aviation monitoring website.“We are returning back, sir, we have lost engines,” a man was heard saying in a recording released by the website. The controller freed up both the airport’s runways but moments later the man called, “Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!”.There was no further communication from the plane, according to the tape, which could not immediately be authenticated.“The last we heard from the pilot was that he has some technical problem ... It is a very tragic incident,” Malik said in a recorded video statement.Another senior civil aviation official told Reuters it appeared the plane had been unable to lower its undercarriage for the first approach due to a technical fault, but it was too early to determine the cause.Aviation safety experts say air crashes typically have multiple causes, and that it is too early to understand them within the first hours or days.The jet first flew in 2004 and was fitted with engines built by CFM International, co-owned by General Electric and France’s Safran, Airbus said.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/i-went-towards-the-light-says-pakistan-plane-crash-survivor/story-2BFIwtqkIeErga5rIYxajP.html
23-05-2020||World||China’s national security law good for business, say Hong Kong’s Pro Beijing politicians||Hong Kong’s pro-Beijing politicians sought to allay worries about the impact of China’s proposed national security legislation on the Asian financial hub’s business environment, saying it would boost investor sentiment.The legislation aims to tackle secession, subversion, terrorism, and foreign interference and could see mainland intelligence agencies set up bases in Hong Kong, raising fears of direct law enforcement.US government officials have said the legislation would end the Chinese-ruled city’s autonomy and would be bad for both its and China’s economies. They said it could jeopardise the territory’s special status in US law, which has helped it maintain its position as a global financial centre.Bankers and headhunters said it could lead to money and talent leaving the city. Hong Kong stocks slumped 5.6% on FridayUpon her return from Beijing late on Friday, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said the stock market “goes up and comes down” and it was in fact the large scale pro-democracy protests in 2019 which destabilised the business environment.“Especially having gone through almost one year of disruptions, violence and uncertainties, anything particularly in safeguarding national security that will help stabilise the environment is indeed very good for local investment sentiment,” she said.Henry Tang, a member of the Standing Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, said the legislation was “beneficial” for the business environment as it brings stability and strengthens the rule of law.Local newspaper Mingpao quoted a Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce statement saying that while more details and explanations were needed to preserve confidence, the chamber “always wanted to see social stability and peaceful business environment, and not violence”.Former Hong Kong chief executive Leung Chun-Ying pointed to large US investments in mainland China despite national security laws there.“Can businessmen tell Hong Kong people, why are there more US companies, US businessmen and US investments in mainland China than Hong Kong?” he wrote in a Facebook post.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-national-security-law-good-for-business-say-hong-kong-s-pro-beijing-politicians/story-yfZV97AZDtXWq0t2S84L6M.html
23-05-2020||World||Berlin church hosts Friday prayers for Muslims to follow social distancing rules||A Berlin church is hosting Muslims who are unable to fit into their mosque for Friday prayers because of social distancing guidelines.The Dar Assalam mosque in the Neukölln district normally welcomes hundreds of Muslims to its Friday services. But it can currently only accommodate 50 people at a time under Germany’s coronavirus restrictions.During the holy fasting month of Ramadan, the nearby Martha Lutheran church stepped in to help, hosting Muslim prayers in Arabic and German.“It is a great sign and it brings joy in Ramadan and joy amid this crisis,” said Mohamed Taha Sabry, the mosque’s imam, who led his congregation in prayer watched over by a stained-glass window depicting the Virgin Mary.“This pandemic has made us a community. Crises bring people get together.”Places of worship reopened in Germany on May 4 after being shut for weeks under a coronavirus lockdown, but worshippers must maintain a minimum distance from one another of 1.5 metres.The church, a red-brick neo-renaissance building in Berlin’s Kreuzberg district could hardly offer a sharper contrast to the cultural centre in Neukoelln where the Muslim congregation is accustomed to gathering.“It was a strange feeling because of the musical instruments, the pictures,” said worshipper Samer Hamdoun. “But when you look, when you forget the small details, this is the House of God in the end...”The Islamic Council, an umbrella group of 400 mosques, said in April that many face bankruptcy because the closures stretched into the holy fasting month of Ramadan, usually a vital period for donations.The church’s pastor, Monika Matthias, said she had felt moved by the Muslim call to prayer.“I took part in the prayer,” she said. “I gave a speech in German. And during prayer, I could only say yes, yes, yes, because we have the same concerns and we want to learn from you. And it is beautiful to feel that way about each other.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/berlin-church-hosts-friday-prayers-for-muslims-to-follow-social-distancing-rules/story-PcndWHNONCjeTarw1sWyMK.html
23-05-2020||World||South America a new Covid-19 epicentre, Africa reaches 1 lakh cases: WHO||South America has become a new epicentre of the Covid-19 pandemic with Brazil hardest-hit, while cases are rising in some African countries that so far have a relatively low death toll, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Friday.“The Covid-19 pandemic today reached a milestone in Africa, with more than 100,000 confirmed cases. The virus has now spread to every country in the continent since the first case was confirmed in the region 14 weeks ago,” the WHO said in a statement, noting there were 3,100 confirmed deaths on the vast continent.Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, WHO regional director for Africa, who is from Botswana, said: “For now Covid-19 has made a soft landfall in Africa, and the continent has been spared the high numbers of deaths which have devastated other regions of the world.” Even so, she said, “We must not be lulled into complacency as our health systems are fragile and are less able to cope with a sudden increase in cases.” About half of African countries are experiencing community transmission of the virus, the WHO said.The situation in South America appeared graver. Dr. Mike Ryan, WHO’s top emergencies expert, speaking earlier to a news conference, said: “In a sense South America has become a new epicentre for the disease.” Brazil is the “most affected,” and authorities there have approved broad use of the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine for treatment of Covid-19, he said. He reiterated that clinical evidence does not support the drug’s widespread use against the disease, given its risks.Nine African countries had 50% rises in cases in the past week, while others have seen a decline or have stable rates, Ryan said. The low mortality rate may be because half the continent’s population is 18 or younger, he said, while saying he remains worried the disease will spread on a continent with “significant gaps” in intensive care services, medical oxygen and ventilation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-america-a-new-covid-19-epicentre-africa-reaches-1-lakh-cases-who/story-5xVw2a5QSzpeixOKMriuvJ.html
23-05-2020||World||Joe Biden accuser’s life marred by abuse and financial hardship||One thing is clear in the complicated, sometimes contradictory and often chaotic story of Tara Reade: Her life has not been easy.Her earliest childhood memory was of being abused by her father, she told her former husband, a man she would later leave after saying he abused her, too.She was also a child of big dreams, of being an Olympic skier and studying acting at Juilliard, before developing an interest in politics. She was hired in 1992 for a low-level staff job for one of the nation’s highest-profile senators at the time, Joe Biden. Less than a year later, Reade said, she was again the victim of abuse, assaulted by Biden in the hallway of a Senate office building — an allegation he vehemently denies.That accusation, which Reade made publicly for the first time in March, has revived difficult questions about how to evaluate allegations of assault in the era of #MeToo. It also has thrust Reade’s life story into the 2020 presidential race and, with it, scrutiny of a woman with a winding trail of extreme debt, an unfounded claim of educational attainment and questionable business practices. Along the way, some people who dealt with her found her duplicitous and deceitful, while others found her a heroic survivor.On Friday, her attorney, Douglas Wigdor, announced he was dropping her as a client. And officials confirmed media reports that she faced an inquiry about whether she was truthful when she testified about her credentials as an expert witness in domestic violence cases, an issue that could serve as grounds for appeal of a number of convictions she had a role in securing.Reade’s story about the alleged assault by Biden is not a straight line, either. It has changed over the past year, from accusations of uncomfortable, harassing behavior to allegations of assault. Reade came forward publicly with her most serious accusation just as Biden was securing a path to the Democratic presidential nomination.It is often not possible to conclusively resolve an allegation like the one Reade has made, where there are no witnesses and no timely police report.So how her claim is evaluated turns largely on her credibility.By some accounts, Reade is a bright and engaging woman who has tried her best as a single mother to raise her daughter while constantly looking for a fresh start. In others, Reade uses her charm and flair for drama to manipulate those supporting her until their goodwill runs out.Reade says her critics have her wrong.“I’m not a lying, manipulative user,” she said in a Wednesday interview with The Associated Press. “I’ve really understood what it’s like to be struggling and poor. I’ve really tried to help people when I could.”This account of Reade’s life is based on interviews with more than a dozen of her friends, relatives and personal and professional associates, as well as numerous interviews with Reade. The AP also reviewed hundreds of pages of court documents, emails and Reade’s own writings.CHILDHOOD OF DREAMS, DISAPPOINTMENTReade was born Tara Moulton in the coastal town of Monterey, California, and says she spent most of her childhood living on a farm in northern Wisconsin. Her father, Robert Reade Moulton, worked as a sportswriter for the Wausau Daily Herald in the 1960s before taking a public relations job with a defense contractor in Minnesota; Reade said her mother, Jeanette Altimus, was an artist.Reade has written that she was an accomplished skier who qualified for the Junior Olympics team in downhill skiing at age 12 in Wisconsin and trained for three years before her parents’ divorce prompted a move to Athens, Georgia.A stepbrother said most people in Wausau skied, mainly at nearby Rib Mountain, but he does not remember Reade being a standout.“I’m sure Tara did, but I don’t really remember her getting some significant accolades for her performance,” said Scott Thoma, 56, of Mound, Minnesota, who was a year ahead of Reade in middle school, when his mother married her father.Reade and her brother Collin lived with her mother after her parents’ split, eventually moving to Georgia, while Moulton and his new wife moved to the Minneapolis area.Another of Reade’s aspirations was to be an actress, performing in “school theatre, community and regional theatre, sprinkled with some radio and television commercials,” according to her blog. She set out for California to pursue acting at age 17 and said she got a referral from a friend to informally train with Robert Reed, an actor best known for his role as the “Brady Bunch” father. She also said she scored an audition in New York for The Juilliard School’s exclusive acting program.Reade said she learned at the audition that no scholarships were available and returned home brokenhearted when her father said he wouldn’t pay the tuition. The school declined to confirm whether Reade was selected for an audition.She wrote in January that her father, who died in 2016, was physically and emotionally abusive throughout her childhood.“Thwarting my college dreams was the mild bit, the rejection and the physical assaults set the stage for how I would walk into the world,” she wrote.Reade often discussed the issue with her former husband, Ted Dronen, according to Dronen’s account in the couple’s divorce filings.“She referenced a long history of events dating back to her first memories in which her father would physically and emotionally, and mentally abuse her. She stated also that her mother seemed not to interfere with petitioner’s father’s abuse,” he wrote.Thoma described Reade’s parents as alcoholics but said he never saw Moulton become angry when he drank, or emotionally or physically abuse Reade or anyone else.“He got frustrated at her,” said Thoma, adding that Reade started more things than she finished. “He would have to put the kibosh on whatever she wanted. But no, I never saw Bob lay a hand on any of us kids, or Collin and Tara.”Dronen, in the court documents, described Reade as also having a sometimes tumultuous relationship with her mother, who he said kicked her out of her house during a fall 1994 argument while Reade was in the late stages of a pregnancy.Reade has said her mother, who also died in 2016, was one of the few people she confided in about Biden’s alleged assault.Early abuse can inform a victim’s relationships for the rest of his or her life, according to Barbara Ziv, a forensic psychologist and sexual assault expert.“If you grow up in an abusive household, where your needs, your basic needs aren’t met and you aren’t taught to appropriately identify boundaries or emotions, then that’s going to impact the way that you develop as an adult,” Ziv said.AN EYE TOWARD POLITICSThere’s little public accounting of the next few years of Reade’s life, after she says her Juilliard dreams were dashed.She eventually attended Pasadena City College, where she says her strong performance in a political science class helped her land an internship in Washington with then-California Rep. Leon Panetta.Reade said in the 2019 interview that she then worked as a field manager for Santa Barbara County Supervisor Gloria Ochoa in her campaign against Rep. Michael Huffington, the former husband of Arianna Huffington. A few days after Ochoa’s loss, Reade said, she got a call to interview for a job with Biden — which she described as a dream job. It was unclear how that interview came about.“I just always wanted to work for Biden. Because at the time, he was the champion of women’s legislation, women’s rights legislation,” she told the AP.Reade said she traveled to Washington and was interviewed by Biden’s executive assistant, Marianne Baker. During their conversation, she said, Biden walked in and was introduced to the young job prospect.“He kind of smiled and said, ‘Hire her,’” Reade said. “That was it.”WORKING FOR BIDENOnce she was in Washington, multiple friends described Reade as a young woman coming into her own.Stacey Lentz, a friend at the time who worked in North Dakota Sen. Kent Conrad’s office, said the two would get together for lunch on Capitol Hill, and on days off, they’d peruse antique shops or enjoy a ballgame.Another close friend of Reade’s, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect her family’s privacy, described her as a laid-back Californian in contrast to her own East Coast conservative upbringing. All three lived in Thompson Markward Hall, a women’s dormitory across the street from the Hart Senate Office Building.Over the years, Reade spoke favorably about working for Biden.Margie Estberg, of Aptos, California, said she got to know Reade after hiring her in late 2017 to pet sit. Over a pizza dinner and cocktails in 2018, Estberg said she asked Reade what Biden was like — and whether Biden was one of the “bad guys.”“I said, ‘Is he a nice guy?’ And she said, ‘Yeah, he is,’” Estberg recently recalled. “I said, ’Oh, good. Because I hate to see somebody who you think is a decent person and somebody shuts them down and says, ‘No, they aren’t.’”Reade said she didn’t share details of the alleged assault with Estberg because she wasn’t ready to discuss it.But Reade’s friend, the one who spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity, said Reade told her a much different story about Biden in 1993. That’s when Reade says she was asked to deliver a gym bag to Biden in a Senate office building; when she met him, she says, he kissed her and digitally penetrated her.The friend said Reade called her a few nights after the assault allegedly occurred, and the friend described in vivid detail feeling “so physically sick” at the disclosure that she ran to the bathroom and threw up in the middle of their conversation.Reade recommended that the AP interview the friend, and reporters spoke to her multiple times, beginning in 2019. Initially, the friend confirmed Reade’s original, limited account of harassment by Biden. When Reade added assault to her allegation in March of this year, this friend also added those details to her own recollection.This friend says she counseled Reade not to file a police report, and now expresses deep regret for what she characterized as leading Reade astray in dealing with the situation.Reade left Washington shortly after the alleged assault. She says she tried to complain about harassment by Biden — but not assault — to a Senate personnel office and the senator’s top advisers, but felt retaliated against and ultimately said she was encouraged to find another job and quit.The AP spoke with numerous current and former Biden staffers in the course of reporting on Reade’s claims, and none recalled such an incident or a report. Some of Biden’s top aides said they didn’t recall Reade at all.MARRIAGE, DIVORCE, ABUSEDuring her time in Washington, Reade met Ted Dronen, whom she describes in a 2009 essay as “a smiling 6’4” blonde Nordic-looking man” who playfully shot her with a water gun at a party one spring night in 1993.Facing financial difficulties after leaving Biden’s office, Reade moved in with Dronen and ultimately asked to follow him to North Dakota, where he was working on a campaign that winter, according to his account in court records.In her divorce filing, Reade described early warning signs that Dronen was explosive and unstable and says she fled North Dakota for California after Dronen became upset that she was pregnant. She soon came back to him, however, and they married in July 1994 and had a daughter that November.In a domestic violence case filed 15 months later, Dronen admits that he attacked Reade but alleges that Reade got violent with him as well.“I admit that on February 21, 1996 my wife and I were involved in a heated argument and during that argument that I may have acted out in an inappropriate manner. During our marriage my wife and I had arguments. She has on past occasions struck me; specifically, in the face. That fact, however, does not excuse my conduct on the date in question,” he states.Dronen did not respond to several requests for comment.In court documents, he suggested that Reade conflated childhood traumas with her recollections of abuse by him.“I believe these incidences, in addition to the abuse, harassment and other truamatic (sic) events in Petitioner’s life, color Petitioner’s perception and judgment in the instant case and I believe them to be the underlying psychological reasons that Petitioner is making me out to be some sort of monster,” he said.During their divorce proceedings, Dronen also told the court that Reade said she was harassed while working in Biden’s office, but made no mention of assault, a detail that was first reported by the San Luis Obispo Tribune.“On several occasions petitioner related a problem that she was having at work regarding sexual harassment in U.S. Senator Joe Biden’s office,” he wrote. Reade “eventually struck a deal” with Biden’s chief of staff and left the office, and Dronen supported her financially as she looked for work.Biden’s former chief of staff, Ted Kaufman, has consistently said no such deal was made.TURBULENT TIMESThe past two decades of Reade’s life have been tumultuous. In her own telling, she had to flee Dronen’s abuse, took shelter in domestic violence safe houses and moved to Washington state, where she changed her name to Alexandra Tara McCabe. She also said she received a new Social Security number to protect her safety, putting her in a “really vulnerable economic situation.”She said the focus on her financial difficulties since coming forward with her allegation against Biden was “classist” and should have no bearing on the credibility of her accusation.“How high does your credit score have to be to be believed as a victim of sexual assault?” Reade asked.Reade’s resume states that she graduated from Antioch University with a bachelor’s degree in political science and later worked at the school’s Seattle campus as an “Ongoing Online Visiting Professor for degree completion.” But school officials said she did not graduate and was never a faculty member, though she was paid to do several hours of administrative work as an independent contractor, a detail first reported by CNN.Reade disputed this, but could not produce evidence that she graduated. She says the number of school credits that could be applied to her graduation was complicated by her name and social security number change, and that the school’s president at the time stepped in to personally confer a degree.The school said that no such arrangement was made.“University officials confirmed with former president Toni Murdock that no special arrangements existed,” university spokeswoman Karen Hamilton said in a statement.She was accepted to Seattle University Law School through an alternative admissions program and obtained a law degree in 2004, but struggled to keep a job. She was helped by sympathetic strangers drawn to her story of escaping abuse, but often failed to meet financial obligations and was perpetually in debt and frequently entangled in legal battles.By May 2006, she was back in California, working as a victims’ advocate for the Monterey County YWCA.There, Reade lodged a series of complaints with the chapter’s board within months of taking the job, alleging that she and others were harassed and discriminated against by managers, which formed the basis of a 2007 lawsuit.Reade and three co-workers alleged that two managers, who were both black, potentially misspent funds and favored African American employees who were members of their church. One supervisor, the lawsuit alleged, made racist comments. Meanwhile, Reade and her three co-workers, all of whom were white, said they were denied benefits and promotions.“I find your response to my recent complaint unacceptable. Therefore, I am taking the next step to get some resolution,” Reade wrote in a Nov. 9, 2006, memo to her boss.She was also upset because someone called her “whitebread,” according to the memo, which was circulated to the board.Bridgette Allen, the former YWCA chapter president, was among those sued. She said she viewed Reade’s persistent emails as an effort to build a court case.“I was the first black board president in the history here. You have to look at the dynamics: It was four white women that accused three black women,” Allen said.But to some of Reade’s co-workers, she was a hero empowered by a difficult past.“She was such a great example of what I wanted to be as a mom and a woman and an advocate,” said Diane Wegner, a former YWCA employee who was part of the lawsuit, which was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum.Reade soon found a new job as executive director at the Animal Friends Rescue Project in Pacific Grove.She also needed a new place to live and, in 2008, turned to Austin Chung, an inexperienced property manager, and inquired about a cottage he was renting out that offered a glimpse of the waves at nearby Monterey Bay.She told him she was fleeing abuse and had no credit history, explaining her change of name and Social Security number. But she did have a law degree and a job, she told him.“My heart went out to her right away,” Chung said.Chung said he had the interior painted and installed new flooring to make the home welcoming.Within five months, she was behind on rent. Pretty soon, she was out of a job, too, after her management style grated on some employees and supporters of the animal shelter, according to former board members.“There wasn’t any one big thing that happened. It was just, over time, her not really being competent,” said Carie Broecker, a longtime former board member. Broecker said she remained friends with Reade until Reade recently threatened to sue her because she publicly discussed her tenure at the agency.Reade said she was proud of her work for the animal shelter.Chung moved to evict Reade after she fell $3,600 behind on rent; Reade accused him of harassment in an email.She eventually left behind a house in need of $8,000 in repairs that included carpets so stained by animal waste that they needed to be replaced, according to Chung, who provided emails and video footage of the home’s interior.In 2011, Reade was again in a relationship that turned violent. Neighbors called Santa Cruz police to her home, and her live-in boyfriend, Edward Walker, was charged with corporal injury and battery against Reade and her daughter.“Male subject battered live-in girlfriend, causing visible injury. During the altercation, the suspect also battered the victims daughter,” police said in an April 3, 2011 report.Reade, who had spent years testifying in court as an advocate for domestic violence victims, acknowledged that Walker slapped her daughter at one point. She paid his bail and continued to live with Walker, caring for him after he suffered a stroke in 2012, court records show.Walker, who could not be reached for comment, pleaded guilty and was given probation. A judge dismissed the charges in 2016.Financial and legal turmoil followed her as she continued to move around California’s central coast, living in some of the most scenic and affluent parts of the state:— She sought a restraining order in 2012 against a neighbor whom she accused of harassment and making racist threats against Walker. A judge dismissed the petition, and Reade dropped the matter.— Months later, Reade was evicted again over $12,750 in unpaid rent. She filed for bankruptcy and listed $406,407 in debts, including nearly $300,000 in unpaid school loans, $1,715 owed to a bail bondsman and $2,100 due to a locally owned grocery store.— Reade enrolled in an advanced legal degree program through Southwestern Law School. The school sued Reade in 2016 over $22,000 in loans, which remain unpaid, according to an attorney working on the case.— She launched a charity that aimed to provide pet food to impoverished animal owners. The group’s nonprofit status was revoked in 2017 after Reade failed to submit three years of mandatory tax filings, though she continued to solicit donations. In 2016, Reade tweeted that she was raising money for a nonprofit called Boudicca Rising Legal Assistance, which included a link to a GoFundMe page she created. There is no record of a nonprofit by that name in the IRS database. Reade raised $210 but said she eventually abandoned the effort because it was too difficult to sort out the logistics.In 2014, Reade started volunteering at a Watsonville, California, nonprofit horse farm called the Pregnant Mare Rescue. She proved to be a dedicated volunteer who excelled at caring for abused horses, but “always had drama and craziness going on in her life,” according to Lynn Hummer, the organization’s founder.“She was always broke and in a crisis,” Hummer said.The two had a falling out in 2016 after Reade charged $1,400 in veterinary care for her horse to the Pregnant Mare Rescue, billing records show.In a June 8, 2016, email to Hummer, Reade acknowledged that she charged the bill to the organization but said that she was poor, that her mother’s health was failing and that she was “disgusted and appalled” that Hummer would “villainize” her poverty.Reade said that she planned on paying back the money but decided against it after Hummer “started trashing me” on social media.At the time, Reade had been asking for money to finance a cross-country move to take care of her mother. She also told acquaintances that Dronen, her ex-husband, had reappeared and was harassing her.According to a letter from a domestic violence advocacy group that Reade shared, Dronen sent her and her daughter “friend requests” via Facebook after 15 years without contact, and the two were scared for their safety. She also inquired about changing her legal name back to Tara Reade, which she goes by now.Eventually, a man in Seattle raised $3,500 for her through GoFundMe.FALLOUTReade says her decision to go public with her claims against Biden has brought her more hardship. She describes facing death threats online and feeling abused and abandoned by the Democratic Party, which she says she’s supported her whole life. Numerous prominent Democrats have said they believe Biden’s denials.Inconsistencies in her accounts have also complicated matters. Defense attorneys are now reviewing whether she may have testified falsely about her education credentials in multiple domestic violence cases, the Monterey County Weekly and The New York Times first reported.Still, Reade, a woman who’s spent her life trying to regain her footing in the face of myriad setbacks, said her decision to come forward has been empowering.“It’s made my life so difficult in so many ways, but I’m doing this for more of an existential reason, and also for my own justice,” she said. When she first spoke out about the sexual assault allegation, Reade said, “I felt this release, of this burden, this secret that I’ve kept.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-accuser-s-life-marred-by-abuse-and-financial-hardship/story-5h33d1h1YT26Gfk4a49fFJ.html
23-05-2020||World||China reports no new Covid-19 cases for first time since January||China on Saturday reported zero new coronavirus infections for the first time since it started reporting data in January, a day after Communist Party leaders celebrated “major achievements” in the virus fight.The virus first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, but cases have dwindled dramatically from the peak in mid-February as the country appears to have brought the virus largely under control.The official death toll in the country of 1.4 billion people stands at 4,634, well below the number of fatalities in much smaller countries.However, doubt has been cast on the reliability of China’s numbers and the United States has led the charge in questioning how much information Beijing has shared with the international community.The milestone comes a day after the opening of China’s rubber-stamp parliament, the National People’s Congress, where Premier Li Keqiang said the country had “made major strategic achievements in our response to COVID-19.”However he warned that the country still faced “immense” challenges.Authorities in Wuhan have come under fire for reprimanding and silencing doctors who first raised the alarm about the virus late last year, and repeated changes to counting methodology have cast further doubt over China’s official data.Beijing has strenuously denied accusations of a cover up, insisting it has always shared information with the World Health Organization (WHO) and other countries in a timely manner.Since first emerging in Wuhan the virus has spread across the world, claiming more than 335,000 lives globally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-reports-no-new-covid-19-cases-for-first-time-since-january/story-rCr50g2Is42lYrAloy9iLL.html
23-05-2020||World||H-1B legislation introduced in Congress to give priority to US-educated foreign youths||A bipartisan group of lawmakers introduced a legislation in both the chambers of the US Congress proposing major reforms in skilled non-immigrant visa programmes by giving priority to US-educated foreign technology professionals in issuing H-1B work visas. The H-1B and L-1 Visa Reform Act, as introduced in House of Representatives and Senate, will require US Citizenship and Immigration Services to prioritize for the first time the annual allocation of H-1B visas. The new system would ensure that the best and brightest students being educated in the United States receive preference for an H-1B visa, including advanced degree holders, those being paid a high wage, and those with valuable skills, proponents of this major legislative reforms said Friday. In the Senate, it was introduced by Senators Chuck Grassley and Dick Durbin. In the House of Representatives, it was introduced by Congressmen Bill Pascrell, Paul Gosar, Ro Khanna, Frank Pallone and Lance Gooden.  The legislation reinstates Congress’s original intent in the H-1B and L-1 visa programmes by increasing enforcement, modifying wage requirements and securing protections for both American workers and visa holders, the lawmakers said. The legislation, among other things, explicitly prohibits the replacement of American workers by H-1B or L-1 visa holders, clarifying that working conditions of similarly employed American workers may not be adversely affected by the hiring of an H-1B worker, including H-1B workers who have been placed by another employer at the American worker’s worksite. These provisions address the types of abuses that have been well-documented. Importantly, the legislation proposes increased crackdown on outsourcing companies that import large numbers of H-1B and L-1 workers for temporary training purposes only to send the workers back to their home countries to do the same job. Specifically, the bill would prohibit companies with more than 50 employees, of which at least half are H-1B or L-1 holders, from hiring additional H-1B employees. The bill gives the US Department of Labor enhanced authority to review, investigate, and audit employer compliance with programme requirements, as well as to penalise fraudulent or abusive conduct. It requires the production of extensive statistical data about the H-1B and L-1 programs, including wage data, worker education levels, place of employment, and gender. In addition, the H-1B and L-1 Visa Reform Act encompasses several reforms of the L-1 visa programme, including establishment of a wage floor for L-1 workers; authority for the US Department of Homeland Security to investigate, audit, and enforce compliance with L-1 program requirements; assurance that intra-company transfers occur between legitimate branches of a company and don’t involve “shell” facilities; and a change to the definition of “specialized knowledge” to ensure that L-1 visas are reserved only for truly key personnel. Asserting that Congress created these programmes to complement America’s high-skilled workforce, not replace it, Grassley said that unfortunately, some companies are trying to exploit the programmes by cutting American workers for cheaper labour. “We need programmes dedicated to putting American workers first. When skilled foreign workers are needed to meet the demands of our labour market, we must also ensure that visa applicants who honed their skills at American colleges and universities are a priority over the importation of more foreign workers. Our bill takes steps to ensure that the programs work for Americans and skilled foreign workers alike,” he said. Reforming the H-1B and L-1 visa programmes is a critical component of fixing the broken immigration system. For years, outsourcing companies have used loopholes in the laws to displace qualified American workers and facilitate the outsourcing of American jobs, Durbin said. This legislation would end these abuses and protect American and foreign workers from exploitation, Durbin said. Indian American Congressman Ro Khanna said that American immigrants come to this country with some of the most innovative, transformative ideas this world has ever seen. “If we’re going to continue to foster a culture of creativity, we must reform the H-1 and L-1 visa programmes to protect all workers from abuses. Immigrants coming here on H-1B visas have made important contributions to Silicon Valley’s leadership in the digital revolution. We want to make sure that talent is coming to the US, but we also want to make sure that it’s being done with proper compensation,” Khanna said. Congressman Pallone said that the US must ensure that qualified American workers have access to job opportunities in this country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/h-1b-legislation-introduced-in-congress-to-give-priority-to-us-educated-foreign-youths/story-zMMAafJAZc40a68OtUUccP.html

23-05-2020||World||Covid-19: New York eases ban on gatherings, up to 10 people allowed||New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo dropped the state’s absolute ban on gatherings of any size Friday, issuing an executive order saying up to 10 people are now allowed to be together as long as they abide by other social distancing guidelines adopted during the coronavirus pandemic.The order, issued on the eve of the Memorial Day weekend, represents one of the biggest steps yet the state has taken to loosen rules adopted in March that have barred anyone but essential workers from getting together unless they live in the same household.It doesn’t necessarily pave the way for the backyard barbecues and group picnics that are a staple of the holiday. The order still requires people assembling to follow “social distancing protocols and cleaning and disinfection protocols required by the Department of Health.”That means people still need to stay at least 6 feet away from other people, or wear a mask or face covering when they cannot maintain that distance in public.New Jersey has adopted similar rules, allowing groups of up to 25 outdoors and indoor gatherings of up to 10 people.Cuomo had earlier in the week signed an order allowing gatherings of as many as 10 people only for religious services and Memorial Day commemorations.That restriction drew a lawsuit from the New York Civil Liberties Union, which said if it was safe to gather for the purpose of honoring veterans and holding religious ceremonies, the Constitution requires the same right be extended to people gathering for other reasons.The NYCLU filed the lawsuit on behalf of New York City resident Linda Bouferguen, who the group says was twice arrested outside City Hall for protesting the state’s shutdown. She wants to organize another protest Saturday.NYCLU Legal Director Christopher Dunn said in a statement that the organization was “glad to see the governor reverse course.”“The right to protest and exercise free speech is the foundation of all our other liberties, and during a crisis is exactly when we need to be most vigilant about protecting it. Health experts, elected officials, and police officers all agree that people can be outside safely while practicing social distancing, and it’s critical that lawmakers create guidelines and direct law enforcement uniformly.”Cuomo spokesman Rich Azzopardi said the new order is in line with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance, which says that gatherings of up to 10 people are safe if people socially distance.“Please be safe and wear a mask,” he added on Twitter.The coronavirus killed another 109 people in the state Thursday. The daily death toll is down dramatically from early April but has stubbornly remained at just above 100 for five consecutive days. Around 5,000 people remain hospitalized.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-new-york-eases-ban-on-gatherings-up-to-10-people-allowed/story-GbGNecroADsYf8IDVlvBYO.html
23-05-2020||World||China measure a ‘death knell’ for Hong Kong autonomy, says Pompeo||Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Friday condemned China’s effort to take over national security legislation in Hong Kong, calling it “a death knell for the high degree of autonomy” that Beijing had promised the territory.Pompeo called for Beiing to reconsider the move and warned of an unspecified US response if it proceeds. Meanwhile, White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said China risked a major flight of capital from Hong Kong that would end the territory’s status as the financial hub of Asia. Shortly afterward, the Commerce Department announced new restrictions on sensitive exports to China.The contentious measure, submitted Friday on the opening day of China’s national legislative session, is strongly opposed by pro-democracy lawmakers in semi-autonomous Hong Kong.Pompeo called the proposal an effort to “unilaterally and arbitrarily impose national security legislation on Hong Kong.”“Hong Kong has flourished as a bastion of liberty. The United States strongly urges Beijing to reconsider its disastrous proposal, abide by its international obligations, and respect Hong Kong’s high degree of autonomy, democratic institutions, and civil liberties, which are key to preserving its special status under US law,” Pompeo said in a statement.He said the decision to ignore the will of the people of Hong Kong would be a “death knell for the high degree of autonomy Beijing promised for Hong Kong” under a decades-old agreement known as the Sino-British Joint Declaration.The US has limited leverage with China over Hong Kong but it could end preferred economic privileges that Hong Kong currently enjoys if the Trump administration determines that the declaration, which was supposed to give the territory 50 years of special status after it reverted to Chinese rule in 1997, has been violated.The proposed bill is aimed at forbidding secessionist and subversive activity, as well as foreign interference and terrorism. It comes after months of pro-democracy demonstrations last year that at times descended into violence between police and protesters.Speaking in an interview with the Fox Business Network on Friday, Hassett suggested the damage that would come from China’s proposal would be mostly self-inflicted.“They’re going to see a lot of economic harm from what they’re doing,” he said, adding that businesses would not want to invest or keep money “in a place where they’re basically sneering at the rule of law.”“And so, I would expect that they’re going to have serious capital flight problems,” Hassett said. “And Hong Kong, if they follow through this, will no longer be the financial center of Asia, and they themselves will bear very, very heavy costs.”Later Friday the Commerce Department struck yet another blow to Chinese industry, announcing plans to bar the export of US technology without a license to 33 companies and government institutions including major research labs.It accused two dozen of the targeted entities of threatening US national security because they could help China develop weapons. They include China’s top cybersecurity company, Qihoo 360, the robotics and artificial intelligence firm Cloudminds Inc., and various research institutes involved in laser and other advanced technology.The other targets, named in a separate news release, included the Institute of Forensic Science at China’s public security ministry and companies that make facial recognition products. Commerce accused them of complicity in human rights abuses targeting Uighurs and other ethnic minorities.The restrictions compound previous sanctions the Trump administration imposed on US technology sales to Chinese companies involved in supercomputer development, facial recognition and other areas the White House deemed a threat to national security. That includes the technology giant Huawei.A week ago, Commerce issued a new rule designed to bar foreign semiconductor makers from making chips for Huawei that it has designed.China contends Washington is using national security as an excuse to try to crush its rise as a global competitor in the tech sector.Tech expert Paul Triolo of the Eurasia Group political risk research firm said it appeared from the list of new targets that the Commerce Department was applying a rather sweeping definition of military end-use.“It’s ratcheting up the pressure,” Triolo said of the newest sanctions. “I keep thinking, ’What’s the straw that breaks the camel’s back here” and provokes retaliation from Beijing against US companies that do business in China.China has threatened countermeasures against US businesses — many of which have major manufactoring operations in its territories— but so far has held off.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-measure-a-death-knell-for-hong-kong-autonomy-says-pompeo/story-PMLjsuNK9esQCu61kKBpYI.html
23-05-2020||World||Drug touted by Trump to treat Covid-19 linked to increased risk of death: Study||The anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine, which U.S. President Donald Trump says he has been taking and has urged others to use, was tied to an increased risk of death in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, a large study published on Friday showed.In the study that looked at more than 96,000 people hospitalized with COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus, those treated with hydroxychloroquine or the related chloroquine had higher risk of death and heart rhythm problems than patients who were not given the medicines.The study, published in the Lancet medical journal, showed no benefit for coronavirus patients taking the drugs.Demand for the decades-old hydroxychloroquine has surged as Trump repeatedly promoted its use against the coronavirus, urging people to try it. “What have you got to lose?” he asked.Trump said this week he has been taking hydroxychloroquine as a preventative medicine despite a lack of scientific evidence.The Lancet study authors suggested that hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine should not be used to treat COVID-19 outside of clinical trials until studies confirm their safety and efficacy in such patients.There is a frantic search for drugs to treat COVID-19 at the same time that multiple research teams pursue a safe and effective vaccine to combat a pathogen that has killed more than 335,000 people worldwide and sickened millions more.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has allowed healthcare providers to use the drugs for COVID-19 through an emergency-use authorization, but has not approved them to treat it.Dr. Mandeep Mehra, one of the study’s authors, said the research shows that the FDA should withdraw that authorization.“That will help move this towards more, stronger evidence because it will then force the use of these drugs only in the setting of control trials,” Mehra said in an interview. “That would be an extremely wise decision.”The FDA has said that, for safety reasons, hydroxychloroquine should be used only for hospitalized COVID-19 patients or those in clinical trials. The drug has been tied to dangerous heart rhythm problems.The Lancet study looked at data from 671 hospitals where 14,888 patients were given either hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, with or without an antibiotic, and 81,144 patients were not given such treatments.Both drugs have shown evidence of effectiveness against the coronavirus in a laboratory setting, but studies in patients had proven inconclusive. Several small studies in Europe and China spurred interest in using hydroxychloroquine against COVID-19, but were criticized for lacking scientific rigor. Several more recent studies have not shown the drug to be an effective COVID-19 treatment. Last week, two studies published in the medical journal BMJ showed that patients given hydroxychloroquine did not improve significantly over those who were not.Hydroxychloroquine is used to treat lupus and rheumatoid arthritis as well as malaria.Hospitalized patients tend to have a more severe version of COVID-19. Some proponents of the drugs for COVID-19 argue that they may need to be administered at an earlier stage to be effective.There are ongoing randomized, controlled clinical trials to study the drug’s effectiveness in preventing infection by the coronavirus as well as treating mild to moderate COVID-19. Some of those may yield results within weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/malaria-drug-hcq-touted-by-trump-as-covid-19-treatment-tied-to-increased-risk-of-death-study/story-fY5HZFVrjR7hc29KrAAdoM.html
23-05-2020||World||Brazlian Prez Bolsonaro’s fiery rhetoric on display in controversial video amid Covid-19 crisis||A video of a controversial meeting between Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro and members of his cabinet became public on Friday, fueling a political crisis that embroils the president just as the coronavirus pandemic grips the country.Footage of the April 22 meeting that lasted more than two hours risks deepening an institutional crisis between the executive branch and the judiciary while leaving some cabinet members in a tough spot. On the other hand, it showed the strength of Economy Minister Paulo Guedes in the administration and may even please Bolsonaro’s most radical followers.The video had been under seal as part of evidence presented by former Justice Minister Sergio Moro, who resigned last month accusing the president of seeking to interfere with police investigations, some of which potentially involve members of Bolsonaro’s family in Rio de Janeiro. The Supreme Court allowed an investigation into the matter, which is ongoing.“I already tried to change people in our security in Rio de Janeiro officially but I wasn’t able to,” the president said in a crucial part of the video, which is riddled with crude language. “I’m not going to wait for them to screw over my whole family just for kicks, or my friends. Why can’t I change someone from security from the end of the line that belongs to our structure. He will be changed! If he can’t be changed, change his boss! Can’t change his boss? Change the minister!”Bolsonaro’s words fueled multiple interpretations, including that he may have been requesting a change in Rio’s police chief for the protection of his family, as Moro claimed. In a different moment, the president also says that the federal police “do not give me information.”Bolsonaro, who denies any wrongdoing, said the video’s release showed “one more farce broken down” and no indication of interference with the federal police.The video also offered Brazilians an unfiltered view of their government’s inner workings while putting on display Bolsonaro’s shocking rhetoric -- including obscenities and sexual references -- and willingness to disparage his political enemies. He made incendiary remarks cursing the governors of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro states.Some cabinet members were left in hot water after the video’s release. Education Minister Abraham Weintraub made disparaging comments about the Supreme Court, saying he would throw the justices in jail. Environment Minister Ricardo Salles suggested taking advantage of the media’s focus on the pandemic rather than the Amazon to “change all the rules and simplify them.”In a statement published after the video’s release, Salles said he “always defended de-bureaucratizing and simplifying rules.” Weintraub did not respond to a request for comment.Institutional CrisisThe Brazilian real rose after the video’s release on bets that its contents are not going to “erode Bolsonaro’s 30% approval rate,” said Roberto Padovani, economist at BV.Bolsonaro’s words have “an anti-systemic populist appeal” that may even provide a boost to his popularity among his most radical base, said Deysi Cioccari, a political scientist with the Pontifical Catholic University of Sao Paulo.“But the video causes an institutional crisis,” she said. “A very strong institutional crisis is coming.”Even though Bolsonaro’s disagreement with some cabinet members has forced the exit of three ministers since the pandemic began -- Moro plus two health ministers -- the president expresses full support for his economy minister in the video, saying he’s never had any problems with Paulo Guedes. That vote of confidence could ease investor worries about the economy minister’s fate.Video UnsealedBolsonaro had initially requested that parts of the meeting that are not related to the probe remain private to protect national interests. Moro, on the other hand, wanted it to be released to the public in its entirety. Portions of the footage released on the Supreme Court’s website were redacted.In his decision to unseal the video, Justice Celso de Mello said his judgement had been informed by the Watergate case that led to the resignation of U.S. President Richard Nixon in 1974. He said it was legitimate for the Court to review acts of the president especially when they have to do with “the Head of State’s supposed criminal practice.” He determined the video should be unsealed for the sake of transparency.As part of the investigation, Mello asked the federal prosecutors to decide whether three requests from opposition lawmakers to have Bolsonaro testify and turn in his personal phone -- along with the phone of his son Carlos -- should be undertaken. There is no deadline for the prosecutor to respond. In a statement, Institutional Security Minister Augusto Heleno called any potential seizure order “unbelievable,” an insult to executive powers, and “a clear attempt to compromise the harmony among powers that could have unpredictable consequences for national stability.”Bolsonaro later told journalists “no one is going to get my phone.”High StakesThe stakes are high for far-right president, who is facing political and economic crises on top of the catastrophic public health crisis. The country’s total case count topped 330,000 Friday, surpassing Russia to become the second hardest hit country, after only the U.S.Bolsonaro’s popularity has declined during the outbreak, in part due to his refusal to adopt social distancing measures and promotion of the controversial anti-malarial drug chloroquine. Contrary to the president, 76% of Brazilians believe social distancing is the best way to prevent the spread of Covid-19, according to a recent poll by XP/Ipespe. And even though half of Brazilians think his administration is “bad” or “terrible”, polling suggests his support base is still quite robust: 25% evaluated the president’s performance positively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazlian-prez-bolsonaro-s-fiery-rhetoric-on-display-in-controversial-video-amid-covid-19-crisis/story-oE2VNqKKr4AZLvdDpbOjWJ.html

As Amjad jumped from his vehicle, he looked overhead to see another passenger still alive and dangling from the plane’s emergency exit, calling for help. “He was alive. He was speaking. He asked me to save him. I forcefully tried to pull him out, but his legs were badly stuck in the emergency door,” Amjad told AFP, saying he called the emergency services. The aircraft’s wings sliced through roofs as the fuselage smashed into pieces, while the fire from the crash spread to nearby homes close to the bustling port city’s airport.Also read | Tracing 8 fatal plane crashes of Pakistan airlines between 1965 and 2020Rescue workers arrived immediately and along with residents began combing through the debris looking for survivors as firefighters tried to extinguish the flames fed by the Airbus A320’s jet fuel.“I heard a blast. Immediately I ran outside. There were clouds of smoke. There was fire. The fire erupted on the roof of a house,” said resident Najeeb Ur Rehman.The alleyway at the centre of the crash was littered with debris from pieces of the plane’s cabin along with personal goods from luggage, which were scattered across vehicles and motorbikes parked in front of homes. Sarfraz Ahmed, a firefighter at the crash site, said several bodies still had their seatbelts fastened while others were wearing oxygen masks, according to another rescue official at the scene. After spending hours working in the scorching heat, rescuers and security forces paused briefly for a few minutes to break their Ramadan fasts as they sipped water and nibbled on fruit at dusk while the call to prayer blared before heading back to the crash site. As night fell over the neighbourhood, cranes hoisted lights over the scene allowing rescue teams to continue combing through the wreckage. The crash comes as Pakistanis across the country are preparing to celebrate the end of Ramadan and the beginning of Eid al-Fitr -- a time when families gather and feast for days after a month of fasting.“This Eid had already become meaningless because of coronavirus, but now it has become a tragedy for all of us, not only the relatives of the victims,” said Mudassar Ahmed, whose home was just blocks from the crash site.Friday was a public holiday in Pakistan kickstarting a mass migration of people travelling back to their homes in cities and villages for Eid, with many slated to see extended family for the first time in months following the lockdown over the coronavirus pandemic.Commercial flights had resumed just a few days ago, after planes were grounded during a lockdown.Also read | In Pakistan plane crash with 99 on board, at least 2 miraculous survivors||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bodies-from-the-sky-horror-as-pia-plane-crashes-among-homes-in-pakistan/story-I234dlhtxOBauWapSzb4vK.html
23-05-2020||World||82 bodies recovered, more feared dead in Pakistan plane crash with 99 on board||At least 82 people were killed when a Pakistan International Airlines plane with 99 people on board crashed into a densely populated residential area near the Jinnah International Airport here on Friday, officials said, nearly a week after the Covid-19-induced air travel restrictions were lifted by the government.Flight PK-8303 from Lahore crashed at the Jinnah Garden area near Model Colony in Malir minutes before its landing in Karachi, they said.The PIA Airbus A320 carrying 91 passengers and eight crew members has crash-landed into the Jinnah Housing Society located near the airport, a spokesperson of the national carrier said.Thick black smoke rose from the accident scene in the Model Colony area.Sindh Health Minister Azra Pechuho told the media late Friday night that 82 bodies have been recovered from the site of the crash so far.It is, however, unclear if the deceased were all on board the flight or include residents of the area where the crash took place.She said there are two survivors including President of the Bank of Punjab Zafar Masood. He called up his mother to inform her of his well-being.“We don’t know exactly how many are injured as yet as we were already in an emergency situation due to COVID-19 (outbreak)...,” she said.Faisal Edhi of the Edhi Welfare Trust said that around 25 to 30 residents whose houses were damaged by the plane have also been taken to the hospital, mostly with burn wounds.The aircraft wings during the crash landing hit the houses in the residential colony before crashing down.“At least 25 houses have been damaged in this incident,” Edhi said. “The first priority is to rescue the people. The main hurdle is narrow streets and presence of ordinary people who gathered at the place after the crash but they have been dispersed,” the minister said.Television footage showed rescue crews combing through debris strewn across the streets of the district - 3 km north-east of the airport - where a number of houses have been destroyed.According to a PIA official, the captain informed the air traffic control that he was having problems with the landing gear before the aircraft disappeared from the radar.The cause of the crash is yet to be confirmed. PIA chief executive Air Vice Marshal Arshad Malik said the pilot had told traffic control that the plane was experiencing “technical difficulties”.Malik rejected reports that the plane had problems even before flying. Talking to the media, he said the aircraft was completely safe and sound.He said all checks and procedures were done and “technically as well as administratively everything was in place and perfect”.The plane with 99 people on board came for landing but just before landing the pilot said he was going for a go-around. While coming for a second landing, it developed some problems and crashed. “The real cause of the mishap will be known after inquiry, which will be free and fair and it will be provided with media,” he said.Malik said that the entire operation will take two to three days to complete. Pakistan has set up a four-member board of inquiry to know the cause of the crash.The board has been asked to complete the probe within shortest possible time, according to an official notification by the Aviation Division of the government. Pakistan’s Dunya News said it had obtained a recording of the conversation, also posted on monitoring website liveatc.net.In it, the pilot says they have “lost two engines”. Several seconds later he calls “Mayday, Mayday, Mayday” and there is no further communication.Meanwhile, President Arif Alvi expressed grief and sorrow over the loss of lives in the plane crash.Prime Minister Imran Khan, while expressing deep sorrow over the loss of precious lives as a result of the PIA passenger plane crash in Karachi, has ordered an immediate inquiry into the incident.Pakistan Army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa condoled the loss of lives and directed the military to provide full assistance to the civil administration in rescue and relief efforts.Prime Minister Narendra Modi condoled the loss of lives in the plane crash and wished a speedy recovery to those injured.The flight was coming from Lahore to Karachi after the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) allowed limited resumption of domestic flights last Saturday following weeks of lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic.Television channels showed several houses and cars damaged in the society where the aircraft crashed.The plane lost contact with the air traffic control at 2.37 PM (local time), PIA spokesman Abdullah Hafeez said.He said that the passengers included 31 women and nine children.This is the first major aircraft crash in Pakistan after December 7, 2016 when a PIA ATR-42 aircraft from Chitral to Islamabad crashed midway. The crash claimed the lives of all 48 passengers and the crew.Friday’s accident occurred on a day when the interior ministry announced Eid holidays from May 22 to May 27, even as the country was facing a spike in the coronavirus cases.The COVID-19 cases in the country have crossed the 50,000-mark after a record 2,603 more patients were diagnosed on Thursday. The death toll stands at 1,067.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-plane-from-lahore-with-91-onboard-crashes-in-residential-area-in-karachi/story-OzQ0qgmaBjJI2WtsA0ydII.html

23-05-2020||India||Sunderbans left unfit for farming||SUNDERBANS: A major humanitarian crisis threatens the Sunderbans region, as Cyclone Amphan has left thousands of acres of land inundated with saline water, rendering the land unfit for agriculture for several years to come, local people, public representatives and experts fear. The cyclone Aila of 2009 had left behind a similar effect. As the land turned infertile for four to five years, a section of the local farm-dependent population came to rely on forest produces, effectively increasing stress on the eco-sensitive zone of the world’s largest mangrove forest. Another section migrated in thousands to other states, especially India’s southern states, to work as labourers.“I am deeply worried about the situation and have started looking for agriculture experts who could suggest ways to reduce salinity from the farmland as early as possible. With loss of jobs and uncertainty over the economic prospect due to the Covid-19 lockdown, the loss of productivity in farmland is coming as a double whammy. A major humanitarian crisis is looming large,” said Pratima Mandal, the Trinamool Congress (TMC) MP from Jaynagar in South 24-Parganas.Of the 102 islands in the Sunderbans, 52 are inhabited by 4.5 million people and the rest are tiger territories. Another 2 million living around the islands have been hit by saline water coming through the rivers of Matla, Raymangal, Bidyadhari and Muri Ganga, among others.A visit to the cyclone-hit areas of the Sunderbans region in the districts of North 24-Parganas and South 24-Parganas revealed how area after area were inundated, with crops on the field ruined and fishes in the ponds dead. But a fear of the long-term loss due to increased salinity in farmland was greatest among the local residents. “The water logged on the fields has no way to go out. Rather, through the breached embankments, saline water will keep entering with every high tide. These lands will remain infertile for the next three-four years, we apprehend,” said Manas Mahato, pradhan of Atpukur gram panchayat in Basirhat sub-division of North 24-Parganas district.Subhas Acharya, a former joint director of Sunderbans Development Board, agreed. “Aila had crippled life in the delta. I apprehend a similar situation this time again,” he said, adding that due to the 4m high storm surge of Aila saline water roared into the villages and croplands remained inundated in saline water for nearly a month in several areas allowing the salt to settle down on the croplands.“This made the land infertile for years. The gaping holes in the rivers’ embankments created by the waves allowed the saline water to freely enter the croplands whenever there were tides. The delta it’s awaiting another humanitarian crisis,” said Acharya.Sandeshkhali MLA Sukumar Mahato and Minakhan MLA Usharani Mondal said that saline water kept hundreds of acres of land in their areas till Saturday afternoon and that they anticipate the water will remain logged for the time being.Biswarup Naskar, a resident of Kakdwip area in South 24-Parganas said that the flooding of sweet water ponds have caused a multidimensional crisis. “Apart from the economic loss for the fishes killed and swept away, there is no food or water for the cattle. The pond water was used to irrigate the crops and backyard farms. The cattle used to drink this water. Villagers have started selling off their cattle,” said Naskar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sunderbans-left-unfit-for-farming/story-iFM2xEPgxsF2wGJt8p0nEK.html
23-05-2020||India||141 flights to W Asia to be part of Vande Bharat phase 2||New Delhi The Indian government on Saturday added 141 more flights to West Asian countries for the second phase of Vande Bharat Mission, its massive repatriation programme for citizens stranded overseas because of Covid-19-related travel restrictions.With these new flights, more than half of them to the United Arab Emirates, the total number of flights in the second phase of the programme has gone up to more than 400, people familiar with development said on condition of anonymity.The flights were added due to increased demand from citizens stranded in West Asian countries and the availability of adequate quarantine facilities in states for the returning Indians, the people said. As with all the flights operated so far under Vande Bharat Mission, priority will be given in the second phase to Indian nationals with compelling reasons for returning to the country, they added.The additional flights are from the UAE (81 flights), Oman and Saudi Arabia (15 flights each), Kuwait (14 flights), Qatar (11 flights) and Bahrain (five flights).A majority of the flights are bound for Kerala (84 flights), while the other destinations are Delhi (10 flights), Tamil Nadu (nine flights), Telangana (six flights) Gujarat and Jammu and Kashmir (five flights each), Bihar, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh (four flights each), Punjab (three flights), Odisha and West Bengal (two flights each), Chandigarh, Karnataka and Goa (one flight each).The other 260-odd flights being operated during the second phase of Vande Bharat Mission are from Armenia, Australia, Bangladesh, Belarus, Belgium, Canada, Egypt, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kyrgyzstan, Malaysia, Mauritius, Myanmar, Nepal, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria, Oman, the Philippines, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sweden, Tajikistan, the UK, Ukraine and the US.The second phase of the repatriation programme began on May 16 and will continue till June 13, with all the flights being operated by state-run Air India and its subsidiary Air India Express. Private airlines are likely to be included in the third phase.In an order issued on Friday, the Centre relaxed travel restrictions to allow certain Overseas Citizens of India (OCI) cardholders, including children of Indian nationals living abroad, to come to the country. As of Thursday, a total of 23,475 Indians have been repatriated under Vande Bharat Mission. The second phase includes new destinations such as Istanbul, Ho Chi Minh City and Lagos, and more flights to the US and Europe.More than 259,000 Indians in 98 countries across the world have registered to return under Vande Bharat Mission. Most of them are workers (28%), students (25%), professionals (14.5%), and short-term visa holders such as tourists (7.6%). Fishermen, deportees and Indian nationals who benefited from visa amnesties have also registered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/141-flights-to-w-asia-to-be-part-of-vande-bharat-phase-2/story-w6L2HMiyXeH49koGlnhAWL.html
23-05-2020||India||Judiciary failed to hold govt liable: SCBA president||New Delhi: Supreme Court Bar Association president Dushyant Dave on Saturday said the judiciary has squandered a chance of winning back the public respect by failing to hold the government accountable for its “failures” in tackling the difficulties citizens have faced due to the Covid-19 pandemic. “[The] pandemic really gave judiciary a chance to win over the hearts of the people by taking proactive steps in the time of crisis, and earn back the respect it once commanded… The judiciary intervenes through public interest litigation in all kinds of matters but when it came to the crunch, it failed,” Dave said in his speech titled ‘Role of Judiciary in Pandemic’ at a webinar organsied by the All India Lawyers Union.Dave was referring to the Supreme Court’s handling of petitions relating to difficulties migrant workers and other citizens have faced during the lockdown imposed in late March to check the pandemic’s spread.He said the courts “failed to protect the rights of citizens during the crisis and remained silent as citizens suffered”.The Supreme Court has declined to entertain pleas concerning migrant labourers left jobless because of the lockdown , nor intervene to mitigate their pain during their long walk back home. In response to a plea seeking free transportation for the workers, the court left it to the concerned states to deal with the situation. The court maintained it cannot pass orders based on media reports. “How can we stop people from walking? It is impossible for this court to monitor who is walking and who is not walking,” the court remarked on May 15.“If they are being provided meals why do they need money for meals,” chief justice of India S A Bobde said while hearing another plea for payment of minimum wages to the workers.Dave said the lockdown was announced with a four-hour notice and caused untold misery but the judiciary chose to look the other way. “Judges cannot sit in the ivory tower and be blind to the miseries of the citizens... The Constitution’s framers wanted the judiciary to supervise the executive’s actions and inactions.”He lamented some of the judges chose to remain silent when they could have taken up cases suo motu based on news reports. “What is stopping outstanding judges from taking up matters [related to Covid-19] suo motu? They should confront the chief justice’s powers as the master of roster. But they are remaining silent.”Dave said various high courts also do not pass orders because they know they will be overturned by the Supreme Court the next day at the government’s request. “We lawyers should galvanise judiciary into action. We have to stir their conscience. Criticism of the judiciary is not contempt,” Dave said, urging lawyers to speak up and remind judges of their constitutional duty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/judiciary-failed-to-hold-govt-liable-scba-president/story-Cf77fZV53lDBwNlPZ2aSlN.html
23-05-2020||India||‘Sensitive’ Anand Vihar off limits to buses||Anand Vihar in east Delhi, which shares its border with Uttar Pradesh’s Ghaziabad and considered a major transport hub of the national capital given that it houses an interstate bus terminal and a railway station, has been classified as a ‘no-go zone’ for Delhi buses by the government in an effort to prevent a large-scale gathering of people as was seen in the initial days of the nationwide lockdown on March 28 and 29. Even as the rest of the city is being catered to by buses and other modes of transport since May 18, no Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) bus or cluster bus is being allowed to make trips to the Anand Vihar area, the Anand Vihar ISBT or the railway station, much to the distress of the residents there. Even para-transit modes such as auto-rickshaws are being permitted only after thorough police checking, senior government officials said on Saturday.“The Anand Vihar bus route is usually one the busiest in the city. We received directions from the district administration and the Delhi Police not to ply buses to Anand Vihar as the area has been categorised as “sensitive”. The bus terminal is completely shut and has been made off-limits by police barricades,” a senior government official, on condition of anonymity, said.In the absence of the Metro, residents were hoping to least take buses to work, but now that, too, is not an option. “While the rest of the city is able to avail of bus services, we are not. Auto-rickshaws are hardly seen in the area, and the few that are there charge twice or three times the metre fare. My office opened this week and I mostly take a lift from my colleague to office, or sometimes, I book a cab,” Khushbu Rai, a resident of D Block Railway Colony, Anand Vihar, said.A senior official in the district magistrate’s (Shahdara) office said the move is aimed to avoid congregations in the area. “In the last two days, there were reports of migrant workers crowding the area again, not on a large scale though. The problem is that the area also has the Kaushambi ISBT on the other side, and many migrants started coming to Anand Vihar hoping to board a bus to their towns,” the official quoted above said.Another official in the Delhi transport department said the UP government is also not running interstate buses. “If migrants simply reach Anand Vihar hoping to return home, it will be a futile effort. Only those who have applied to the administration and have been cleared for travelling can get a seat on a bus or a train. There are no interstate buses plying other than those which have been coordinated by the two states. Also, the Anand Vihar railway station is operational only for Shramik Special trains (meant to ferry migrants home),” the official said.Days after the nationwide lockdown was announced on March 24, thousands of migrant workers had flocked to the Anand Vihar interstate bus terminal hoping to catch a ride home. At least a lakh migrant workers had gathered outside the terminal. Kejriwal had then urged migrant workers to stay back and promised them shelter and meals.The gathering of migrant workers in large numbers, which led to blatant violation of social distancing norms, led the Union ministry of home affairs to suspend two top bureaucrats of the Delhi government, while issuing show cause notices to two others for ‘dereliction of duty’. The Delhi Police had then filed cases against DTC drivers for taking their buses out on the roads and ferrying migrant workers to Anand Vihar.Officials in the DTC said they are plying over 1,000 buses for public transport across the city and around 1,600 are deployed for transportation of migrant workers and for maintaining law and order. Also, a 1,000 cluster buses are plying in the city currently.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sensitive-anand-vihar-off-limits-to-buses/story-bw6TMIsPG2ZHadjCMgBy3J.html
23-05-2020||India||Schools must ensure access to e-classes for the poor: Govt to Delhi HC||If Economically Weaker Section (EWS) category students in private schools are unable to access classes online during the lockdown due to lack of devices or the internet, schools must take steps to ensure they can, the state government has submitted in the Delhi high court. The submission was made by the Directorate of Education (DOE) on Friday evening in response to a plea filed by Justice For All, an NGO, which contended that several students belonging to the EWS and disadvantaged groups (DG) were unable to access classes online due to the lack of availability of these devices. The NGO contended that the decision of private, unaided schools to conduct online classes would affect over 50,000 students who cannot afford laptops, phones or high-speed internet. All private and government schools are shut due to the lockdown, put in place to curb the spread of the Covid-19 and classes are being held online.The state government’s submission came on a notice by a high court bench of justices Manmohan and Sanjeev Narula, to the Centre, the Delhi government, municipal corporations and a few private unaided schools on May 8 seeking a response on the matter. Earlier this month, Hindustan Times had reported that EWS students enrolled in private schools are struggling to keep up with classes online.Advocate Shikha Bagga, secretary at Justice For All, said Saturday: “The affidavit filed by the Delhi government in the high court clearly mentions that it is the duty of schools to ensure no child is deprived of education online due to lack of material required for attending online classes.”The affidavit submitted by the Delhi government mentions that as per Section 12(1)(c) of the Right of Children To Free And Compulsory Education Act, 2009, “it is the obligation of the private unaided schools to provide the aforesaid facilities to EWS/DG category students admitted in their schools.” Malkeet Singh, a contractual driver , has two children studying in top private schools in west Delhi, under the EWS category. While his younger daughter is managing her studies with the help of her teachers and friends, his 11-year-old son has been unable to attend any classes.“We do not have a laptop or a smartphone so he has not been able to attend any online classes. I got to know through other parents that his tests are slated to begin Monday. We don’t know what to do,” he said.His son’s school is among the 15 which were served notices by the education department in the past one week after it was found out that EWS/DG students in these schools were not attending online classes regularly.A senior DOE official, requesting anonymity, said, “The schools concerned were issued showcause notices as per the orders of the court.”On behalf of a few schools that received the showcause notice, advocate Kamal Gupta said, “While targeting private schools, the petition doesn’t talk about how 17 lakh government school students would access online classes in the absence of gadgets. The petition was only filed so that the government could get funds from the Centre.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/schools-must-ensure-access-to-e-classes-for-the-poor-govt-to-delhi-hc/story-J9VLu3KgPQqZMdouMRQN6M.html
23-05-2020||India||Odia man travels from Mumbai to see father on deathbed, ends up in quarantine||Amit Behera travelled more than a thousand kilometres from Mumbai fervently hoping to see his cancer-stricken father on his deathbed for the last time.But his wish remained unfulfilled as his father died on Friday while he was in a quarantine centre a few km away from a hospital in Balasore district where the older man was being treated.Behara who hails from Guhalia village of Balasore district and works in Mumbai’s Tata Memorial Cancer Hospital had reached Oisha on Tuesday to see his father Damodar one last time. But he did not get to stay with his father as he was taken to the institutional quarantine centre at his village for a 21-day stay. His father passed away at the hospital on Friday afternoon and Behera could not see him.“On Thursday, I had last spoken to my father through video-call and promised him that he would meet him. But all my requests to the nodal officer of the quarantine centre to allow me to visit my father at hospital were turned down. It would always haunt me that I could not see him on his deathbed,” said the youth.After the death of his father, the sarpanch allowed Behera to perform the last rites on Friday afternoon but asked him to return to the quarantine centre by 5 pm. Behera hurried through the funeral, while breaking down several times.Behera’s father was diagnosed with cancer and in 2017 was being treated at Tata Memorial. After being treated for three years there, he had come back to his home last year. But two months ago, the 60-year-old again fell sick. As the lockdown was on, he could not be taken to Mumbai and instead admitted to the district headquarters hospital in Balasore where he died.“I will always regret that I was unable to speak to my father,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odia-man-travels-from-mumbai-to-see-father-on-deathbed-ends-up-in-quarantine/story-re9lJKZTT6ur6Mn6TN2HRI.html
23-05-2020||India||Covid Red zone districts make way for containment zones as states across India push economic activity||Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Punjab, West Bengal and Jharkhand have no Covid red districts. Chhattisgarh has just four red zone blocks and Odisha has quarantine centers in Ganjam and Balasore districts as red zones. Haryana has two red districts, Uttar Pradesh five and Madhya Pradesh four.These are just a few examples of the falling number of red category districts since May 17, when the Centre allowed the states to decide on red, orange and green zones. In fact, several states have disbanded the colour categorization and have opted for more dynamic containment zone declaration, whose number can be changed on a daily basis.The health ministry provided a formula on the basis of which an area can be declared as a red zone depending on the number of containment zones or clusters in it. Number of containment zones in an area form a cluster and several clusters constitute a red zone. Only districts with more than 200 positive cases should be declared a red district, according to the health ministry’s directive issued on May 16.In the normal course, the red zones or containment centers or clusters should have increased in the states as the Covid cases have seen the biggest spike since May 17. On Saturday, India had about 1,25,000 Covid cases as compared to about 37,200 on May 1, covering about 550 of the total 736 districts in the country. But, most states have not reported substantial increase in the number of even containment zones as they apparently want to ease restrictions and allow economic activities to return to the normal level. “We have gone by the Central government rule which allows just a locality or a block to be declared a red zone instead of a district,” explained an official of the Chhattisgarh government, which on Saturday declared only four blocks in the state as red zones. Till last week, four districts in the state were in the red zone defined by the Central government. In these 4 blocks, Chhattisgarh has 44 containment centers, same as on May 17, although the number of Covid cases has increased to 172 from 120, a week ago. “The zones are declared keeping in mind the present situation and the geographical area,” the official said.On Saturday, Jharkhand placed all 21 districts with Covid cases in orange zones with no district in red zone. The state’s three districts Khunti, Pakur and Sahebgunj, where not a single Covid-19 case has been reported so far, are in the green zone. Ranchi, Garhwa and Hazaribag, which were once red zone districts, have now been converted into orange zones. “Presently the state has no red zone district as none of the 24 districts have reported more than 200 positive cases. Therefore, all 21 affected districts are placed in orange zone and three other districts, which have not reported any positive case so far, are declared green zones,” said state health department’s principal secretary Nitin Madan Kulkarni. Similarly, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh have done away with the concept of red, green and orange zones, and have instead adopted the strategy of marking very active, active and dormant clusters. Before May 17, Andhra Pradesh had five red districts --- Kurnool, Krishna, Guntur, Nellore, and Chittoor. In Telangana, six districts – Hyderabad, Ranga Reddy, Vikarabad, Suryapet, Medchal- Malkajgiri and Warangal (Urban) were in the red zone. Now, Andhra has 341 clusters and Telangana 130. Andhra Pradesh’s nodal Covid officer, Arja Sreekanth, said clusters that report many fresh cases in the last five days are classified as very active; those which report cases in the last 6 to 14 days are notified as active and those reporting cases only in the last 15 to 28 days are classified as dormant clusters.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesThe two Telugu speaking states have given powers to district collectors to identify these clusters and implement strict lockdown norms there. “The number of containment clusters keep changing on a day to day basis depending on the increase or decrease in the number of Covid-19 positive cases,” S Subrahmanyam, an official in Andhra’s Covid-19 command control room said. Kerala has also discontinued the zonal classification and adopted a containment area approach and given the police powers not to allow people in these areas to move out of their houses. In the worst affected areas, triple lockdown is in force, meaning only one entry and exit point to help police to keep a tab on each person who enters or leaves. From May 19, Karnataka did away with the colour categorisation of districts and focused instead on containment zones, which are 126 in the state. At its peak, Karnataka had 273 containment zones. “The number of containment zones is a dynamic number which changes on a daily basis,” said a state health department official, who was not willing to be named.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19In Uttar Pradesh, only five districts — Agra, Meerut, Kanpur, Gautam Buddha Nagar and Ghaziabad — now fall under red zones, as against 15 before May 17. However, the containment zones have increased from 450 to 708. Principal secretary health and family welfare, Amit Mohan Prasad explained that those districts which do not report a large number of fresh coronavirus infection cases will be automatically categorised as green zones. Haryana has classified 22 districts as orange zones. Only Sonepat and Faridabad are now red districts. The six parameters on the basis of which fresh evaluation was done by the state government are total number of active cases, active cases per lakh population, doubling rate (calculated over seven days period), case fatality rate, testing ratio (number of tests per lakh population) and sample positivity rate (confirmation rate), officials said. The state has 261 containment zones. Uttarakhand has seven containment centers with no red district now and Himachal has 12 containment zones with Kangra still notified as a red district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-red-zone-districts-make-way-for-containment-zones-as-states-across-india-push-economic-activity/story-vu8J9QOQgApQmSHhYhJGrM.html
23-05-2020||India||MP struggles to halt virus as more districts affected||The number of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in Madhya Pradesh has increased by around 3000 in the past fortnight, mirroring the national trend of an acceleration in the number of cases in this period. The state now has 6100 cases, with almost 50% of these being added in the past fortnight. More worryingly, the cases have sprad to 49 of the state’s 52 districts. Till a fortnight ago, only 24 districts were showing cases. There are two things that stand out about Madhya Pradesh’s situation. One, the testing. According to the latest data available on the HT dashboard, Madhya Pradesh has tested 1828 per million of its population, lower than the national average of 2096 per million -- worrying, because the state was one of the early hotspots of the infection in India. Two, the returning migrant labourers’ contribution to Covid-19 cases in Madhya Pradesh is just 4.86%, according to Madhya Pradesh health department, showing that the infection has predominantly spread locally. Contribution of migrant workers to total Covid-19 cases was 57% in Bihar and 62% in Odisha, according to data of health departments of both the governments. Around 500,000 migrant workers have returned to the state thus far. There are reasons for Madhya Pradesh to worry. Among the six states having highest number of Covid-positive cases, MP’s death rate at 4.40% with 272 deaths, is second only to Gujarat, which has a mortality rate of 6.04%; MP’s mortality rate is 1.5 times more than the national average death rate of 2.97%, according to data released by the union ministry for health and family on Saturday morning.The state is convinced things are improving. According to additional chief secretary, health department, Mohammed Suleman: “The R naught factor (which indicates how many people an infected person passes the infection on to) was 1.95 around April 1. This has come down to 1.27. This suggests that multiplication of the virus has reduced. The doubling rate has gone down to 17 days from 12 days. Recovery rate has gone up to about 47% . The death rate, which used to be around 6%, has come down to 4.2%. Our testing has been ramped up hugely which is about 1500 per million population now. All these are good indicators.”Independent experts are not convinced. They are concerned that the state has walked back on its earlier plan of testing widely. According to public health expert Amulya Nidhi: “The state government’s strategy was to identify, isolate, test and treat (IITT). In the last two weeks, the infection has spread to about a dozen new districts but Madhya Pradesh is lagging far behind the testing capacity. MP has just 20 testing labs, whereas other states which have a comparable population , such as Gujarat and Tamil Nadu, have increased the number of labs to 37 and 67 respectively.” A government official who didn’t want to be named said, “There were suggestions for massive survey, screening, collection of samples and testing in Bhopal, Indore and Ujjain in particular but administration struggled to get enough testing kits. The health minister requested the Centre at least twice to send more kits.” One of the early hotspots of the disease in MP, and indeed, India, was Indore, once touted as India’s cleanest city. But chief medical and health officer (CMHO) at Indore, Praveen Jadia, said the city faces significant challenges: “Ensuring compliance of lockdown restrictions and social distancing in dense and congested localities continues to remain a big challenge. The death rate has come down and recovery rate has increased significantly but until and unless social distancing is ensured in such localities it’s difficult to say how much time it will take to control the situation.”So does Bhopal, according to the city’s collector Tarun Kumar Pithode. It’s far too crowded. “Social distancing was practically not possible in such areas like Zinci, Jehangirabad, Aishbagh, Talaiya, Mangalwara etc where we find a corona cloud, a term we have given not because of any spread in atmosphere but dense population. That’s why we have started taking people out of these localities. We have taken 2000 people out of Jehangirabad alone. This strategy, coupled with strict containment zone plan and legal provisions, have helped us and the number of positive cases is decreasing significantly,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mp-struggles-to-halt-virus-as-more-districts-affected/story-OZ17xYuTS2IaZQ0xpzDc8K.html

Around six crore people have been affected by the cyclone. With a large number of trees and electric poles blocking the roads in Kolkata and several other districts, power supply has not been restored to a large part of the State.On Saturday, 10 NDRF teams stationed in Odisha also left for Bengal for road clearing operations.Meanwhile, the Odisha government on Saturday submitted a preliminary report on the damages caused by the cyclone in the state as well as post-cyclone restoration works to the Centre. In its preliminary report, the state government said 44.4 lakh peole in 10 districts have been affected. Besides, 8.72 lakh livestock have also been affected.Around 34 km of 33 kilovolt lines, 453 km of 11 kilovolt lines, 680 km of low tension lines and 2,439 number of Distribution Transformers have been damaged.

The state will also charge special Covid-19 fee amounting to 50% of MRP. In a notification issued by the state excise department, the government said home delivery of liquor will be allowed by existing ON & OFF shop licensees of Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) and beer in areas other than Covid-19 containment zones and shopping malls. A ‘special Covid fee’ amounting to 50% over the MRP will be charged to generate additional revenue for the state government, excise commissioner Anjan Kumar Manik said.The excise commissioner said home delivery of liquor can be taken up by retailers directly and through reputed food aggregators like Zomato, Swiggy, delivery service providers and standard technology platforms, etc. acting as retail aggregators. However, they need to obtain no-objection certificates (NOC) from the excise commissioner for the purpose.The outlets can levy delivery charges of Rs 100 for orders up to Rs 1,000 and thereafter Rs 25 for every additional Rs 500 order value. In no case, the delivery charge will exceed Rs 300.As per the guidelines of the excise department, the shops will have to display their phone/mobile/WhatsApp number/email id/UPI details for receiving orders and facilitating digital payments outside their shop. The Odisha State Beverages Corporation website (www.osbc.co.in) will also put out the district wise list of ON/OFF shops licensees along with their details.The product-wise latest MRP will also be put up on the website. Retailers can take orders for home delivery over the phone or through SMS, WhatsApp, email etc. Liquor can be delivered between 7am and 6pm and delivery is expected to be made within six hours of placing the order. The government has made it mandatory for delivery agents to follow necessary social distancing norms like wearing masks, maintaining six feet distance and frequently using sanitiser.Officials said the special Covid-19 cess is expected to make up for the revenue shortfall that the state is likely to face in 2020-21 due to massive economic recession triggered by the lockdown. Though Odisha has budgeted total revenue receipts of Rs 1.24 lakh crore in 2020-21, it is unlikely to achieve it as RBI has forecast negative GDP growth.In 2020-21, Odisha had set a target of Rs 5,250 crore excise revenue, 14.1% increase in its excise revenue of Rs 4600 crore in 2019-20. Excise revenue is one of the three important own-tax revenues of the state after GST and VAT/sales tax.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-to-allow-home-delivery-of-liquor-will-charge-50-special-covid-19-fee/story-e9NFVf4MK1dzclMyimzZhI.html

Several areas of Kolkata were rocked by protests on Saturday as residents took to the streets as many localities remained without water and power since the cyclone swept through southern Bengal on Wednesday.People armed with placards blocked roads with empty buckets and utensils.The protesters said they are under extreme hardship as there was no electricity and water for the past three days and repeated calls to power utilities CESC and WBSEDCL went unanswered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamata-banerjee-s-decision-to-seek-army-help-good-move-bengal-governor/story-bsSq5Ui2O76hIDeumWaEjJ.html
23-05-2020||India||Men in khaki give footwear to migrant workers walking thousands of miles to reach home||The sight of migrant labourers marching thousands of miles to reach their native places barefoot is heart-wrenching. The stories and the images on social media about the suffering and misery of these migrants will remain etched in our memory forever.The overwhelming majority of these migrants are young people, in their 20s and 30s, existing in highly precarious circumstances. Many of them are in short term employment contracts, they don’t own their own property and live in privately rented accommodation, away from their families, most of the time sharing a flat often in overcrowded circumstances, and they don’t have enough savings to last them long.Pushed by circumstances, these people were faced with two stark choices: to stay put, or to return to their homeland and their more caring family environment. Many of them decided to walk back home in the face of no transportation facilities.In a bid to help these migrants, Agra police set up stalls to provide slippers and shoes to migrant workers free of charge. Vikas Jaiswal, CO, Sadar Circle, says, “The summer months in Northern India are as it is challenging. The roads become blazing hot, especially during the daytime, and walking barefoot on them becomes extremely painful. Understanding the problem, the police department of Agra decided to offer slippers and shoes to these migrants.”Since the beginning of the lockdown, Agra Police has been helping poor people, migrants, rickshaw-dwellers and labourers with food packets and water bottles.Jaiswal adds, “These are migrants who have been walking for days together from Madhya Pradesh and Rajassthan. This is the least we can do for them. Their smiles are the biggest blessings we are getting.”Agra Police will continue to render these services in the coming days to all migrants coming back to their homes. The cops have also put up a banner, letting the migrants know about their initiative. The message on the banner reads, “Come let’s cooperate, one mission, one initiative, free shoes and slippers for migrant labourers”.Jaiswal shares, “On learning about our initiative and getting the slippers, many labourers and migrants had tears in their eyes. Such initiatives will go a long way in developing trust in the police and the state machinery.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/men-in-khaki-give-footwear-to-migrant-workers-walking-thousands-of-miles-to-reach-home/story-P4lLTI5IQ0GZp2Jrs446ZL.html
23-05-2020||India||Judiciary failed to protect citizens’ rights amid Covid-19 pandemic: Dushyant Dave||The difficulties faced by citizens due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the failure of the government to tackle the same presented the judiciary with an opportunity to hold the government accountable and win back the respect of the public but it was squandered, senior advocate Dushyant Dave said on Saturday.The courts failed to protect the rights of citizens during the crisis and remained silent as citizens suffered, Dave who is also the President of the Supreme Court Bar Association said in his speech on the topic ‘Role of Judiciary in Pandemic’ organized by the All India Lawyers Union.“(Covid-19) pandemic really gave the judiciary a chance to win over the hearts of the people by taking proactive steps in the time of crisis and earn back the respect it once commanded….The judiciary intervenes through public interest litigation in all kinds of matters but when it came to the crunch, it failed,” Dave said with specific reference to the Supreme Court’s handling of petitions relating to difficulties faced by migrant workers and other citizens due to the lockdown announced by central government on March 24.The Supreme Court has consistently declined to entertain cases concerning migrant labourers since March when various petitions were first filed highlighting the plight of labourers.In a plea seeking free transportation for migrant workers to their native states, the top court left it to the concerned states to take action to deal with the problem maintaining that it cannot pass orders based on media reports.“How can we stop people from walking? It is impossible for this court to monitor who is walking and who is not walking,” the court had remarked.Another plea for payment of minimum wages to migrant workers during the lockdown was also disposed of by the apex court on April 21, without any concrete directions.“If they are being provided meals, why do they need money for meals,” Chief Justice of India, SA Bobde, who was hearing that case, asked.Dave said that the lockdown, which was announced with a 4-hour notice, caused untold misery to people but the judiciary chose to look the other way.“Judges cannot sit in an ivory tower and be blindfolded to the miseries of the citizens of India. The Constitution framers wanted the Judiciary to supervise the executive’s actions and inactions,” Dave said.He also lamented that some of the outstanding judges chose to remain silent when they could have taken up cases suo motu (on its own) based on news reports instead of waiting for petitions to be listed before them by the Chief Justice of India.“What is stopping outstanding judges from taking up matters (relating to Covid-19 issues) suo motu? They should confront the chief justice’s powers of master of roster. But they are remaining silent,” he said.Various high courts also do not pass orders because they know that their orders will be overturned by the Supreme Court the very next day at the request of the government, he added.“We lawyers should galvanise the judiciary into action. We have to stir up their conscience. Criticism of the judiciary is not contempt,” Dave said urging lawyers to speak up and remind judges of their constitutional duty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/judiciary-failed-to-protect-citizens-rights-amid-covid-19-pandemic-dushyant-dave/story-GXUEmIQQaamHZGEcLcTYgJ.html

Rajapaksa briefed Modi on steps being taken by his government to restart economic activity.“In this context, both leaders agreed on the need to accelerate Indian-assisted development projects in Sri Lanka.

23-05-2020||India||Nepal PM Oli’s new map tactic had three key objectives. China is the common factor||Nepal Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s move to release a new political map this week and escalate tensions with New Delhi was designed to consolidate his loosening grip on the party and government, people familiar with the development said on Saturday.The government’s strategic experts told Hindustan Times that PM Oli appeared to have been driven by three objectives, closely linked to each other, to put out a new political map that placed Kalapani, Limpiyadhura and Lipulekh in Nepal.One was to consolidate himself in the Nepal Communist Party government where he believed, two former prime ministers Pushpa Kamal Dahal “Prachanda” and Madhav Kumar Nepal had been trying to pull the rug from under him. PM Oli, according to the assessment in New Delhi, has been trying to outdo the two former PMs and it was only after the intervention of Beijing that the three power centres in Nepal’s ruling party agreed to stick together. For now.Two, the new political map puts the focus back on the differences over India’s boundary over the tri-junction point of Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura in Nepal’s northwest that separates China and the Tibet Autonomous Region to the north and India’s Kumaon to the south.Also Read: Lipu Lekh: The past, present and future of the Nepal-India stand-off | AnalysisThis means China isn’t the only country with whom India has a substantive border dispute. Or conversely, China isn’t the only country that has a border dispute with its neighbours.This effort to put the spotlight also gives China a handle, particularly since it had endorsed India’s position on these territories in 1954 and 2015.“There is a strong view in the government that there had been a change in Nepal’s pitch and tenor on the boundary question,” a person familiar with the government;s assessment said. It was this view that Army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane was echoing when he last week underlined that the noisy protests over the 80-km road to Lipulekh for pilgrims to Kailash Mansarovar could be at the behest of “someone else” – a veiled reference to China.Also Read: When China and Nepal became ‘strategic partners’ | AnalysisFor example, New Delhi was surprised when Nepal had protested India’s map released after splitting Jammu and Kashmir into two union territories, complaining that the map inaccurately showed parts of Nepal to be in India.“The government hadn’t made a change in the map so far as the boundary with Nepal is in question,” one official said, calling that protest a reflection of Nepal letting China dictate its relations with India.The third factor, a national security planner, said had a lot to do with China’s growing footprint in Nepal that has caused some unease in the country, and the government. Some of this discomfort often gets reflected on social media also. “But when you whip up ultra-nationalistic sentiments against India, you end up channeling the public resentment from China to target India,” he said.Also Read: China cannot dictate terms to a free media in Nepal. Can PM Oli resist?| AnalysisThere have been several instances of the standard Chinese ham handed effort to propagate its belief, culture and projects in Nepal, right from the hard push to popularise Mandarin language to the increasing presence of its enterprises in small and micro-enterprises of Nepal. Local traders in Nepal around its tourist hubs are slowly feeling the heat due to the Chinese presence, an Indian official familiar with the situation in Nepal said..Of course, the attempt by Chinese companies to palm off sub-standard kits related to the Covid-19 outbreak hasn’t helped either.The sharp public opinion over quality concerns around Covid-19 kits and protective gear did finally force the Nepal government to cancel the contract.At an administrative level, a source said, resentment was also building around the slow progress over the mega projects to be built by Chinese companies that China had pushed under its Belt and Road Initiative.Kathmandu had accepted only 9 of the 35 projects proposed by China including the Kathmandu-Kerung Railway that alone is estimated to cost at least $ 2.3 billion, about 10 percent of Nepal’s GDP. The utility of the railway line, which has been projected to end Nepal’s dependence on India for supplies, has been questioned given that the military strategic mileage would be drawn by China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nepal-pm-oli-s-new-map-tactic-had-three-key-objectives-china-is-the-common-factor/story-iVmMXyruoYnOHAzell8wDO.html

However, the train did not have any stoppage in Ganjam and was supposed to halt at Khurda road railway station from where they were supposed to travel to their respective quarantine centres in their panchayats. So when the train crossed Chilika, the migrant workers pulled the chain,” said a East Coast railway official.The Government Railway Police later detained the workers at the Chilika Railway Station and informed the officials of Ganjam district who arrived with vehicles to ferry them to the quarantine centres.Saturday’s incident has come on the back of dozens of such incidents involving migrant workers who are reluctant to stay in 21 days of institutional quarantine after long gruelling travel from their workplaces in other States. Since May 1, about 2.32 lakh migrant workers in different States have come back to Odisha and are being quarantined for 21 days in about 16,000 quarantine centres in rural areas.“For the migrant workers, the quarantine centres have become virtual jails. Most of the centres don’t have basic facilities. After losing their jobs in their workplaces, the quarantine centres are adding to their stress,” said Pradip Pradhan, social activist.With 90 per cent of the total 1,269 Covid cases being reported from those in quarantine centres, the government acknowledges the importance of the centres in containing the spread of pandemic, Yet in several quarantine centres, the migrant workers say the arrangements leave much to be desired. Early this month, over 150 migrant workers fled the quarantine centre protesting lack of drinking water while in another such centre, they alleged that the food was inedible. On Saturday, 54 inmates of K Ramchandrapur quarantine centre of Ganjam district had blocked the Aska-Sorada road alleging lack of electricity and drinking water supply at the centre. A couple of days ago, the video of inmates of a quarantine centre of Bolangir district boycotting the food had gone viral.With few clean and adequate number of toilets in several quarantine centres, there have been reports of many inmates defecating in the open. “The government through advertisements in social media had said the migrant workers would have a comfortable stay of 21 days in the quarantine centres. But on ground that is not happening,” said Sarbeswar Behuria of Jajpur district, a local panchayat leader.In the quarantine centre of Dhunkapada grampanchayat in Ganjam’s Polasara block, the inmates alleged of dirty toilets and lack of hand sanitisers. The rising positive cases among those quarantined has led to fear and apprehension among villagers towards migrant workers.On Friday, hundreds of people in Bajipur village of Balasore district, a Covid hotspot staged a road blockade demanding that six migrants who had returned from Maharashtra be put in quarantine. “We have asked sarpanch, police and local tehsildar to keep the migrant workers in quarantine. However, no one seems to pay any heed,” the locals alleged.Epidemiologist Binod Patra of AIIMS Bhubaneswar, said unless the government successfully manages the quarantine centre, the risk of community transmission may not be ruled out. “At least 3-4 lakh migrant workers are expected to arrive in the coming days. If the government fails to keep them at the quarantine centres for 21 days, the cases may just gallop in monsoon months,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/400-odia-migrant-workers-deboard-from-train-to-escape-quarantine/story-f8nBDLDBoHPuIZqxyfWW1K.html
23-05-2020||India||Covid-19: This Eid, no ‘gale milana’, no prayer gatherings, no handshakes||Under the shadow of the coronavirus, the states across the country are taking special precautions to mark Eid al-Fitr, the celebration that breaks the month long fast for Ramadan. This Eid there will be no shaking of hands or no warm embracing for Muslims because of the stringent social distancing.Depending on the sighting of the moon, Eid celebrations will begin either on Sunday or Monday. But prayer gatherings, outdoor festivals, and other public events have been curtailed or cancelled to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.The Kerala government has allowed shops and markets to open till 9 pm on Saturday and on Eid certain relaxations have been announced. Usually, full lockdown is in force on all Sundays but it has been eased a bit this time. Short movements are admissible but crowding will not be allowed. Many clerics have asked believers not to crowd mosques and follow directives of the administration.“True, mass prayers are integral to Eid. For believers, it is painful to miss them. But the situation warrants so,” said chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan while greeting Muslim brethren on the eve of the festival.In Karnataka, there is a dichotomy with coastal areas of the state bordering Kerala observing Eid-al-Fitr and Khutub- E- Ramzan on Sunday and rest of the state observing it on Monday. There is a statewide curfew which has been imposed on Sunday and the Hilal committee as well as the Waqf board has appealed to people not to gather for ‘Salat Al Eid.’ The Rakat prayers will also be held indoors and there will be no congregation, said a Hilal committee release.Government officials say that shopping is allowed till Saturday 7 pm as mandated in the SOP, no assembly will be permitted on Sunday.In Chhattisgarh, prayers will be offered in the mosques, but no more than five people will be allowed. “No congregation is allowed during Eid and we have appealed that celebrations should be done inside the house. We have also appealed not to spend money on shopping and purchasing. Instead, the money should be distributed among the poor and sufferers in this crisis,” said Shehar Qazi of Raipur, Mohammad Ali Farooqi, adding that appeal to follow social distancing has been made in the festival.The Superintendent of Police, Raipur, Arif Sheikh, said no congregation is allowed in the city.The historic Gandhi Maidan in Bihar, after more than 90 years, will not host any Eid prayers in view of the pandemic and the need to maintain social distancing.Gandhi Maidan Eid Namaaz committee chairman Mahmood Alam and secretary Maulana Misbahuddin said that since 1925, this will be the first time in 2020 that the Gandhi Maidan will not have Eid prayer.He said the tradition of Eid prayer at the Gandhi Maidan had been started by one Salim Rine after getting the order from Patna’s Collector. Gandhi Maidan has so far witnessed over 40,000 prayer meetings, while chief minister Nitish Kumar has also been part of quite a few.There will be no shaking of hands or no warm embracing this year, because of the stringent physical distancing norms imposed by the government.“You won’t notice the typical “gale milana” (wishing each other with warm embracing) this year. The festive atmosphere would be missing this Eid. Fighting the dreaded virus and saving humanity is more important than celebrating Eid,” said Mufti Anwar Ahmed, a religious preacher from Jamia Nizamia, Hyderabad, said.He said Muslims have to perform Salat-al-Duha or Namaz-e-Shukrana (Islamic prayers) within their homes and greet each other. “There shall be no public gatherings to greet one another as has been the practice in the past because of the lockdown restrictions,” the Mufti said.On the call given by Ulemas and Muftis from all schools of Islamic thought, the Muslims in Hyderabad have been offering Taraweeh prayers at their homes during Ramzan month.In Uttar Pradesh too this Eid will be like never before with lockdown in place and appeals from both Shia and Sunni clerics to keep it a low key affair and instructions to offer Eid namaaz indoors.Maulana Khalid Rasheed Firangi Mahali, chairman of Islamic Centre of India and imam of Aishbagh Eidgah, has appealed to Muslims to avoid the crowd and celebrate the upcoming Eid festival at their homes while following social distancing norms issued by the Centre in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic.“I had also requested the community to avoid ‘Alvida namaz’ (prayer offered on last Friday of Ramzan) at mosques in view of the pandemic and I am happy that they followed also,” said Maulana Khalid Rasheed Firangi Mahali.The usual celebrations were missing in Kashmir too as very few people could be seen in the markets. Sheikh Ashiq, president of Kashmir Chamber of Commerce Federation and Industries, said that Eid used to be a big business activity. “Ahead of Eid businessmen used to get different items in bulk and sales for the Eid used to cross between Rs 300 to 500 crore.’’ He said that for the businessmen it used to be a big stimulus. “Our losses are vast if we compare from lockdown to lockdown.’’Nawab Malik , Maharashtra Minority Affairs Minister, too on Saturday urged people not to gather in basements, parking areas, or any other place to offer prayers during Ramzan, saying social distancing is the need of the hour.“Our religious leaders already urged people not to violate lockdown rules and to contribute in the best possible way to fight this challenge. Muslim community will not demanding any exemption and ready to celebrate Eid without any gatherings,” said Malik.(With inputs from state bureaus)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-this-eid-no-gale-milana-no-prayer-gatherings-no-handshakes/story-7aVKsWzipwE1Vnv94HK6XN.html

23-05-2020||India||No red zone in Jharkhand, 21 districts in orange and 3 in green zones||Following the centre’s new guidelines allowing states to categorise areas in their territory into different zones, Jharkhand decided not to place any of its districts in the red zone and instead categorised all 21 affected districts as orange zones.The state’s three Covid unaffected districts-- Khunti, Pakur and Sahebgunj—were put in the green zone.Ranchi, Garhwa and Hazaribag, classified as red zone districts during the third phase of lockdown, have now been converted into orange zones.“Presently the state has no red zone district as none of the 24 districts have reported more than 200 positive cases. Therefore, all 21 affected districts are placed in the orange zone and three other districts, which have not reported any positive case so far, are declared green zones,” said state health department’s principal secretary Nitin Madan Kulkarni.He added, “The state currently has 106 containment zones in which 1.09 lakh people reside. A total of 19,200 samples have been tested which shows that as many as 198 people from these containment zones were infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus.”For Coronavirus Live UpdatesAs per the guidelines of ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW), the green zones will be districts with either zero confirmed cases till date; or with no confirmed case in the last 21 days. Whereas, districts will be marked as red zones or hotspots on the basis of six different parameters including more than 200 active cases, high doubling rate and sample positivity rate greater than 6%.Feedback from the district officials will also be taken into consideration. Those districts, which are neither red nor green, are categorised as orange zones.Jharkhand has so far reported 330 positive cases including 191 active ones, 136 cases have recovered and three people have died. The state has been witnessing a steep surge in Covid-19 cases after May 1 when stranded migrant workers started returning to the state.According to the state disaster management department, about 1.38 lakh migrant workers have arrived so far with more to come. About 3 lakh workers have expressed interest in returning to Jharkhand from different states.“As many as 19,686 migrant workers have so far been tested for Covid-19 and 147 of them were found infected with SARS-COV-2 virus. About 8% of these patients have returned from Mumbai, a Covid-19 hotspot,” health secretary Kulkarni said.He added that the state government was putting all migrant workers in quarantine centres and tests are being conducted on those found symptomatic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-red-zone-in-jharkhand-21-districts-in-orange-and-3-in-green-zones/story-z8MyhzB8vKwKeqWmaMGJFK.html
23-05-2020||India||In Kashmir, an Eid without fervour under the shadow of Covid-19||As in all other places, it will be an Eid like no other in living memory in Kashmir also.The lockdown to check the spread of Covid-19 has meant that there are few shoppers and with the economy heading south, not many are willing to spend either.Unlike the usual buzz around Eid in Kashmir, when markets used to hum with thousands of shoppers, there is just quietness around this time. With the fervor missing, Eid is set to be a sombre festival, though many people could be seen thronging around the designated bakeries and confectionery shops. But in many places, officials swung into action and sealed many shops for violations of social distancing..Kashmir Chamber of Commerce Federation and Industries president Sheikh Ashiq said that Eid used to be a big business activity in Kashmir. “Ahead of Eid, businessmen used to get different items in bulk and sales used to be between Rs 300 to 500 crores which was a big stimulus for businessmen. But now our losses are vast if we compare from lockdown to lockdown.’’Prior to Eid, business worth hundreds of crores of rupees used to be conducted across the valley as every household used to make purchases. “This time only people were buying essentials items and many shopkeepers had not even made the Eid delicacies including bakery products due to Covid-19,’’ said Wajhat Ahmad, a hotelier.Compared to previous days, a surge in the traffic movement was visible on Saturday. However, most shops were closed and only a few shops selling groceries and confectioneries were open especially those which had official permission.“This is the first time when I feel the hustle and bustle of Eid is missing. Only 10 percent of people are shopping in the markets. With closure of shops, the people prefer limited shopping in their places,’’ said Abdul Gaffar, who owns a confectionery shop in the iconic Lal Chowk area. Even many prominent bakeries remained shut. “Our staff had gone home and there was no demand for bakery products so we didn’t prepare any items,’’ said manager of a prominent bakery on the Residency Road.Meanwhile, Srinagar district administration took action against over 50 stores and 80 vehicle owners for violation of restrictions. The action was taken during an inspection that the District Magistrate Dr Shahid Iqbal Choudhary conducted.The DM inspected markets at several places including Sanantnagar, Hyderpora, Chhanpora, Bagh-e-Mehtab, Jawahar Nagar, south city and Batmalloo. “During the inspection it was found that a large number of non-essential and non-permitted shops including readymade garments, furniture, hardware, and others were illegally operating. Violations of social distancing norms and hygiene were also seen at many department stores and bakeries,’’ a senior officer of Srinagar district administration said.Even at many places there was a shortage of essentials and especially chicken and meat. “It’s unfortunate that chicken which used to sell Rs 130 rupees a kilogram was sold at Rs 180 and meat was not also available as many butchers hadn’t opened their shops. It doesn’t look like Eid is tomorrow,’’ said Nisar Ahmad, a businessman. “This is the second time in an year when we will be celebrating Eid like this, the last Eid we couldn’t celebrate due to curfew was imposed after the Article 370 was abrogated and this time Eid us under lockdown of Covid-19.’’||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-kashmir-an-eid-without-fervour-under-the-shadow-of-covid-19/story-9z1YQbCzQKqmJuslSlKYtI.html
23-05-2020||India||Covid 19 update: Karnataka imposes 14-day quarantine,tougher restrictions for arrivals from 6 worst-hit states||The Karnataka government has made 14-day home quarantine mandatory for all passengers coming into the state except for those arriving from high virus prevalence states like Maharashtra, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, who will have to undergo seven days of institutional quarantine and seven days of home quarantine.Those coming from the six states that are worst hit by coronavirus will be allowed to complete the second week of quarantine at home if their Covid test comes out to be negative when tested 5-7 days after their arrival. However, pregnant women, children under 10 years of age, senior citizens over 80 years of age and terminally ill patients will be allowed to be in home quarantine but only if they are found not infected with coronavirus when tested immediately after their arrival in the state.Businessmen coming to state for urgent work will also be exempted from institutional quarantine as long as they furnish a test report confirming their negative status. The test report, however, cannot be more than two days old from the date of travel and must be issued by an ICMR approved laboratory.The strict measures were announced on a day when the state recorded its single biggest day rise with 216 new Covid-19 positive cases. Almost all of them are returnees from Maharashtra, except for 12 people. More than half of the 1,307 active Covid-19 cases in the state have been recorded in the last one week after the return of a large number of migrants from the neighbouring states.The state till date has registered 1,959 patients of coronavirus including 42, who died and 608, who were discharged.An official of the state health department said 442 passengers who arrived by air on Saturday from Doha, Jakarta, Male and Kula Lumpur had been quarantined.Meanwhile, there was some chaos and confusion near palace grounds located in the heart of Bangalore as thousands of people mainly from Odisha and the northeastern states thronged it in the hope of catching a Shramik train back to their native places. A state health department official, who did not want to be identified, said the confusion was the result of a “miscommunication”.The official said that about 1,500 people, registered on the Seva Sindhu app for migrants looking to return, had been sent SMS asking to assemble near palace grounds for a medical check-up and onward bus journey to the train station for catching their respective Shramik trains.For Coronavirus Live Updates“However, they forwarded the messages to their friends whose turn had not yet come. This resulted in a huge number of people assembling near the grounds,” he said.When HT spoke to several of the migrants on Saturday afternoon, they said, they had been waiting since 6 am in the morning with no food or water or any toilet facilities but only with their luggage, in the hope that they could board a train and head back to their native states.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19Karnataka’s medical education minister K Sudhakar, who landed at the spot, tried pacifying the migrants. KPCC President D K Shivakumar, who also visited the spot, reiterated the party’s offer to foot the travel bill and castigated the government for “not making proper arrangements and making them wait under the hot sun without food and water”.On Friday the Karnataka government headed by BS Yediyurappa had announced that it would bear the cost of travel for all migrants looking to return to their native states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-update-karnataka-imposes-14-day-quarantine-tougher-restrictions-for-arrivals-from-6-worst-hit-states/story-bW59YpAf73PNWQrL7xeQeI.html

23-05-2020||India||BJP, Congress youth wings go all-out to outdo other in Covid-19 relief||The frontal organisations of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the opposition Congress are trying to outdo each other in relief distribution and quick response to distress calls during the coronavirus-induced lockdown across the country.The Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) and the Youth Congress have been flooding the social media platforms with posts regarding their relief activities during the pandemic.Medicines for a cancer patient in Bihar’s Rajendra Nagar and for another with a neurological ailment in Mumbai’s Goregaon; money and food for a group of 18 people, including children from Uri in Jammu and Kashmir, and for nine others, including a pregnant woman from Nagaland who ran out of essentials during the lockdown are on top of the BJYM’s list of quick responses.Taking a cue from its parent political outfit, the BJYM has set up helplines to offer aid to those in need. A toll-free helpline that works 24x7 was set up and social media platforms were used to disseminate information about the ‘BJYMCares’ initiative launched on April 1.“We realised that the pandemic is a great equaliser; and we could use this as an opportunity to use our ideological training in seva (voluntary work). So we set up a system where our members could reach help down to the mandal level,” said BJYM president Poonam Mahajan, who is also a Lok Sabha MP from Mumbai North Central.On the other hand, the Youth Congress since the beginning of the nationwide lockdown on March 25 too has supported the needy, distributing food, groceries, water and medical facilities to stranded migrants and the poor, including the Hindu refugees from Pakistan living in the national capital.The Youth Congress turned its Delhi headquarters into a 24x7 food bank, installed a roti (bread) making machine to ensure that a large number of people are served food.“On the instructions of our leadership, we will continue to provide help to the migrants and the poor and try to minimise the far-reaching consequences of this draconian lockdown imposed upon the people and do so till the nation wins this fight against deadly coronavirus,” said Youth Congress president Srinivas BV.The BJYM has also formed a national coordination team with states being clubbed into six zones. A team of 100 people monitor online requests in different shifts, BJYM functionaries said, adding requests are routed to the teams on the ground and a report sent to the national team. The turnaround time is short with medicines, packed food and ration being provided in most cases within 30 minutes to an hour.Over the last few weeks, the BJYM, which claims to have over 10 crore members, has focused on distributing homemade masks, distributing personal protection equipment apart from helping migrants sort out train registrations. “No call for help goes unheard or unassisted,” said Mahajan.For its part, the Youth Congress has also started campaigns such as ‘Meri Zimmedari’, ‘Hume Garv Hai’ and 1 crore mask distribution. Under the ‘Meri Zimmedari’ campaign, the Youth Congress instructed its volunteers to provide relief in any form possible to the needy, through ‘Hume Garv Hai’ it felicitated Corona warriors and sanitation workers.The Youth Congress has so far distributed once crore masks to the people, Srinivas said, adding these masks were produced at its Delhi headquarters and offices across the country by those who lost jobs due to the lockdown.The BJYM has also collected more than 58,000 blood units donated by its workers and volunteers and a list of more than 1.5 lakh donors are on standby to meet exigency.Like the BJYM, the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad or ABVP, the students’ wing of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), too organised blood camps.An ABVP functionary said volunteers have been distributing masks, sanitisers, ration and cooked food in collaboration with local administration. “We also reached out to landlords who have provided accommodation to students and appealed to them to forego their rents. We have also been receiving calls for help from students from the Northeast,” said ABVP general secretary Nidhi Tripathi.The medical divisions of ABVP, Medivison and Jigyasa, in collaboration with local administration in Rajasthan’s Jodhpur and Bikaner, Bengaluru, Kerala, Gujarat and Haryana, offer free aid; while in Pune, volunteers are involved in door-to-door scanning,The ABVP, which claims to have over three million members, is also organising remedial classes and online guest lectures.The Youth Congress too organised blood donation camps and facilitated travel of migrant workers. Similarly, medical supplies and food is also being provided for those returning to their homes through trains at different railways stations and bus terminals.“The entire Youth Congress family, right from the block level to the national level, is working with great enthusiasm and determination. We are determined to continue this fight against corona, its effects and the government apathy and relief is being given to all without any discrimination,” Youth Congress national media in-charge Amrish Ranjan Pandey said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-congress-youth-wings-go-all-out-to-outdo-other-in-covid-19-relief/story-wiZI1ESpoAZbX4IF0sY15H.html
23-05-2020||India||Kerala sees highest single-day spike with 62 new coronavirus cases||Kerala recorded 62 new coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases on Saturday, the highest single-day spike since the viral outbreak was first reported in the state in end-January, raising concern for the state government to call an all-party meeting on Wednesday to discuss strategies to fight the pandemic.The state has reported 794 Covid-19 positive cases, of which 275 are still active, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said on Saturday. Among the 62 new cases, 18 people have returned from abroad, 31 came back from other states, while 13 contracted SARS-CoV-2, which causes Covid-19, in Kerala, the CM said.The state government is also worried that seven healthcare workers have tested Covid-19 positive among the 62 new cases. The authorities have declared nine more places in the state as hotspots, where strict containment measures have been enforced.Palakkad district has reported the maximum number of new Covid-19 positive cases at 19, followed by Kannur in north Kerala (16).“A spike in Covid-19 positive cases was expected, as people have started returning to their native places from abroad and other states amid the easing of lockdown restrictions. We’ve to strengthen our containment measures. People and society need to play a bigger role. If we enforce quarantine norms strictly, we can win this war,” the CM said while announcing that an all-party meeting has been called on Wednesday to tackle the pandemic.Earlier, the Congress had criticised the CM for “taking all decisions unilaterally” and the opposition was never consulted.Kerala is likely to report more Covid-19 positive cases in the coming days, as domestic flight service operations, which were suspended since the lockdown restrictions were imposed on March 25, will resume from Monday.However, the state government has made it clear that it would insist upon entry passes and compulsory home quarantine facility for all domestic air passengers. Those who fail to obtain passes would have to undergo institutional quarantine for two weeks.The state government’s proposed move is at odds with Union Minister for Civil Aviation Hardeep Singh Puri, who has said that domestic air travellers need not be quarantined, as they would travel by short-haul flights.The state government has tightened its surveillance norms and taking strict action against those who flout quarantine norms. Over 200 people have been booked in the last two days for violating home quarantine norms. The state government recently launched a motorbike squad to monitor people, who are under quarantine at home.Besides, the authorities are strict about letting people travel from the worst Covid-19-hit states in the country such as Gujarat, as a Shramik Special train was twice rescheduled and cancelled last week. Though the Gujarat government had said the trains were cancelled at Kerala’s behest, CM Vijayan skirted the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-sees-highest-single-day-spike-with-62-new-coronavirus-cases/story-Puc1zTMdQfRVKh1Mpmle0L.html
23-05-2020||India||India’s Covid-19 tally goes up by 30,000 this week||Between Monday and Saturday India’s Covid-19 tally went up from 95,000 to 1,25,000 while the global count reached 5 million.A total of 3,720 people have died so far in the pandemic while 51,784 have recovered.Maharashtra continues to be the worst hit state in India, accounting for 44,582 cases of out of the 1.25 lakh cases. The only silver lining that the state has is that the Covid-19 mortality rate has fallen from 4.76% to 3.49%, in the past one month, according to the data from the Maharashtra Health Department.But during the same period, the number of deaths went up drastically to 1,454 on Thursday, from 269 deaths on April 22. On Saturday, Maharashtra’s death toll was 1,517.Tamil Nadu with almost 15,000 cases, Gujarat with over 13,000 and Delhi with almost 13,000 cases are three other states with high numbers of Covid-19 cases.During the week, the Covid-19 tally in Odisha crossed the 1,000 mark and Goa saw the return of the disease after the first seven patients were cured last month. Goa’s tally now stands at 54.Kerala, which continues to have the highest recovery and lowest mortality rates, is also battling to contain rising after a large number of Malayalees returned from overseas and other states. Kerala’s tally has reached 732 with 220 active cases.Assam also has seen sharp rise this week with the total now at 259. At one point the tally had doubled to 204 in four days prompting the government to improvise its quarantine programme.In Kashmir, five doctors tested positive for Covid-19, sparking fear among the population. Four of the doctors had treated a patient who died of Covid-19.Meanwhile as the race continues to find a vaccine for Covid-19, researchers say that a vaccine developed in China, that has reached phase one clinical trial appears to be safe and may protect people from the coronavirus, the New York Times reported.The report, based on a Lancet study, cited an early-stage trial conducted by researchers at several laboratories involving 108 participants aged between 18 and 60. In the trial, those who received a single dose of the vaccine produced certain immune cells, called T cells, within two weeks while the antibodies needed for immunity peaked at 28 days after the inoculation.Also on Saturday, China reported zero new coronavirus infections for the first time since it started reporting data in January.Covid-19 cases in China have dwindled dramatically from the peak in mid-February as the country appears to have brought the virus largely under control.In the United States, New York’s Governor Andrew Cuomo dropped the state’s absolute ban on gatherings of any size on Friday.Under a new order, up to 10 people are now allowed to be together as long as they abide by other social distancing guidelines adopted during the coronavirus pandemic. New York has been one of the worst hit cities in the US.The order represents one of the biggest steps yet the state has taken to loosen rules adopted in March that have barred anyone but essential workers from getting together unless they live in the same household.On Friday, Brazil’s health ministry said there were 3,30,890 confirmed Covid-19 cases in the country. That figure took it past Russia, which had the second-highest number of cases in the world on the Johns Hopkins University tally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-covid-19-tally-goes-up-by-30-000-this-week/story-KPpgtoNakGiKVrZQ1E4aSP.html

Therefore, tinkering with the taxes or cess would not be a prudent option at all. They opined that an additional cess was likely to further dampen the consumers’ sentiments and could also weaken the markets’ strength, especially when the Government is pushing to boost consumption.The officials added that experts have suggested that taxes and cesses should not be interfered with unduly in the present circumstances.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesThey added that according to the ministry’s understanding, such a measure may prove to be myopic and not result in any long-term gains.A look at the well-established tax practices internationally and the responses by governments during the pandemic will reveal that such imprudent fiddling has not been tried in any tax regimes across the world, including those with the GST model, the officials said, before summing up that none of the countries, developed or developing, have increased taxes to counter economic impacts of Covid-19.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19A few days ago, the finance ministry had to initiate disciplinary action against a group of senior officers who gone public with their suggestions to mop up revenue through several measures including hiking taxes for the super rich. The government had then clarified that it had neither authorised the group to come up with a proposal or given it permission to go public with it, a move, it said led to panic among the general public.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-rejects-talks-of-an-additional-cess-on-gst-to-raise-revenue-to-fight-coronavirus/story-nyugxea1zex6btcYlFRKxL.html

23-05-2020||India||After Ashwagandha, experts claim Kangra Tea has properties to block Sars-Cov-2||After the well known herb Ashwgandha, now, Kangra tea has been marked as a potential coronavirus blocker. A senior research professional associated with a reputed bioresource technology institute has claimed that Kangra Tea, well known for its other medicinal properties, may also be able to boost immunity against coronavirus by blocking the virus activity better than the anti-HIV drugs currently being used as preventive care for patients and health care professionals.According to a communication released by the Ministry of Science and Technology, India’s premier medical research institute, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) is considering replacing hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) with anti-HIV drugs to improve immunity and possibly reduce viral replication. However, Kangra tea could prove to be a more effective weapon against the disease, says a well known expert.“The chemicals in Kangra tea could also be effective in boosting immunity as they can block coronavirus activity better than anti-HIV drugs,” said Dr Sanjay Kumar, Director, Institute of Himalayan Bioresource Technology (IHBT), based in Palampur, Himachal Pradesh.Dr Kumar made the claim during a webinar organized at IHBT on the occasion of the International Tea Day.The claim, along with a comparison with HIV drugs and hydroxychloroquine, comes at a time when the Centre has decided to expand its use as a preventive medication for asymptomatic healthcare workers who are engaged in providing services even at non-Covid-19 hospitals, for frontline staff who are deployed on surveillance duty in the containment zones and for paramilitary and police personnel who are engaged in fighting coronavirus.The endorsement of Kangra tea as a potential virus killer or fighter comes days after a group of researchers of IIT-Delhi revealed that herb Ashwagandha contains certain bio-actives that interact with SARS-CoV-2 virus in a way that prevents it from multiplying. According to experts, Ashwagandha, which is also popular as an aphrodisiac, has a natural compound called withanone (Wi-N), with the potential to block Covid-19’s enzyme responsible for replication. It is being alleged that Ashwagandha, if used along with an active ingredient of propolis called Caffeic Acid Phenethyl Ester (CAPE) can block the replication process of the virus.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesDr Kumar, while discussing the benefits of Kangra tea along with the medicinal properties of tea for human health, spoke of the technologies developed and transferred by IHBT for combating Covid-19 disease.“Using computer-based models, the scientists screened 65 bioactive chemicals or polyphenols that could bind to a specific viral protein more efficiently than commercially available anti-HIV drugs approved for treating Covid-19 patients. These chemicals might block the activity of the viral protein that helps the virus to thrive inside human cells,” said Dr Kumar.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19IHBT, a constituent of Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), has also produced and supplied the alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing tea extract and natural aromatic oils through its technology partners. The Institute has developed herbal soap with tea extract, natural saponins (phytochemicals found in most vegetables) and without SLES (sodium laureth sulphate), SDS (sodium dodecyl sulphate) and mineral oil. This soap provides anti-fungal, anti-bacterial, cleansing and moisturizing benefits. The soap is being produced and marketed by two companies based in Himachal Pradesh.“Tea catechins production process which has been transferred to M/s Baijnath Pharmaceuticals, and Ready to Serve Teas and Tea wines which could be game changer for Kangra tea”, added Dr Kumar. Catechins are natural antioxidants that help prevent cell damage and provide other benefits. The first flush of Kangra tea, grown at a height ranging from 900 metres to 1400 metres above the sea level in Kangra district of Himachal Pradesh, is known for quality, unique aroma and tinge of fruity flavor. A little milder than Darjeeling tea in terms of flavour, Kangra tea has more body and liquor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-ashwagandha-experts-claim-kangra-tea-has-properties-to-block-sars-cov-2/story-fiQug1BFcVbdxYy5gOZeDP.html

However, some states such as Karnataka is in favour of quarantining air passengers, especially if they are flying out of worst-hit Covid-19 states such as Maharashtra, Gujarat, etc.Goa is conducting swab sample tests on all those entering the state and then quarantining them until the ICMR allows conducting TrueNat rapid antibody tests.Kiosks have been set up at the airport, checkpoints on roads, and at the port for the collection of swab samples. Rail passengers are escorted via buses to hospitals, where they are undergoing tests.It takes a few hours for the results of swab samples to be made available.Rapid antibody tests are a blood test for the presence of antibodies. The ICMR had suspended antibody tests after the state complained of inaccurate results.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-seeks-icmr-nod-to-conduct-antibody-tests-on-arriving-air-passengers/story-vGamL4H4qHm6lluqVxbYaK.html

23-05-2020||India||Centre accepts Mamata Banerjee’s request, sends 5 Army columns to help Kolkata||The Defence Ministry on Saturday decided to send five columns of Indian Army to help Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee to restore infrastructure in state capital Kolkata. The Centre’s decision followed a request from the West Bengal government that appeared to have been overwhelmed by the magnitude of the relief work needed in the state battered by cyclone Amphan.In a string of tweets, the home department said the Bengal had mobilised just about everyone it could within the constraints of the lockdown in a unified command mode but it needed more help.The National Disaster Response Force had earlier said they were putting together 10 more teams to help the state. The state already has 26 NDRF teams in the cyclone affected areas of Bengal.“Based on the request from the government of West Bengal, Indian Army has provided five columns to assist the Kolkata City Civil Administration in the aftermath of Cyclone Amphan,” a person familiar with the development told Hindustan Times. Each column has about 35 personnel.“More than a hundred teams from multiple departments and bodies working for cutting fallen trees, which is the key to restoration of power in localities,” the home department tweeted. GOWB mobilizes maximum strength in unified command mode on 24×7basis for immediate restoration of essential infrastructure and services asap. Army support has been called for;NDRF and SDRF teams deployed; Rlys,Port & private sector too requested to supply teams and equipment(1/3)It added that the Bengal government had also reached out to the railways, port authorities and the private sector to join the gigantic task ahead.Cyclone Amphan, the most severe storm in the Bay of Bengal since the super cyclone of 1999, made landfall around 20km east of Sagar Island in the Sunderbans on Wednesday afternoon, cutting off road links, snapping telecommunications and power lines. It killed about 85 people in West Bengal including about 15 in state capital Kolkata.Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had told Prime Minister Narendra Modi who visited the state on Friday that the cyclone had, according to the government’s back of the envelope calculations, caused destruction worth Rs 1 lakh crore. PM Modi, who announced an interim relief assistance of Rs 1,000 crore, had praised Banerjee’s handling of the double whammy for Bengal, which is already battling to contain the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak.The Bengal government had earlier in the day asked the railways ministry to stop the Shramik Special trains from reaching the state till May 26, pointing that the district administration was already stretched to its limits “As the district administrations are involved in relief and rehabilitation works, it will not be possible to receive special trains for the next few days. It is therefore requested that no train should be sent to West Bengal till May 26,” Bengal’s top bureaucrat Rajiva Sinha told the Railway Board in a letter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/need-army-support-mamata-banerjee-s-bengal-sends-sos-to-centre/story-u3YkYhxub6ywo9wFdGHWTI.html

The ministry in a media address on Saturday afternoon added that it had already transported a total of 45 lakh migrants through inter and intrastate services provided since May 1.The announcement of the Shramik special schedule comes at a time when railways has also announced a gradual resumption in its normal passenger services with 100 pair of trains from June 1 in addition to 15 pairs of Rajdhani special services in operation to address the rising demand for interstate travel with the easing of restrictions from lockdown clamped to contain the spread of coronavirus pandemic.“A total of 2,600 Shramik Special trains will run for the next 10 days, originating from 19 states for destinations in 16 states, carrying 36 lakh passengers,” the official said.The official also shed light on the controversy around payment of fares for Shramik Specials and said that 85% of costs to run a Shramik special are borne by the Central government and the remaining 15% of operation costs are being borne by the state governments in the form of fares. He added that after some initial hiccups, coordination has been established with state governments on this issue. He added that the railways has provided 4.7 million free meals to passengers and other needy people.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19The railway official said that 80% of the Shramik trains run so far serviced destinations in Bihar and UP, the two states with the highest population of the migrant workforce.The official added that given the demand for more Shramik specials, 50% of modified Covid care train coaches will now be used to run trains for transporting the migrant workforce.Railways had converted more than 5,000 wagons into Covid Care Centres to augment the country’s dedicated health infrastructure to fight coronavirus spread. The official said these coaches will now be used as Shramik Specials as they are lying unutilized as health care centres, he, however, added that these coaches could be reconverted into covid care centres if the need arises.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesListing other contributions made by the railways in the country’s fight against Coved 19 pandemic, he said a total of 17 Railway Hospitals had been converted into independent Covid Care Hospitals in addition to the infrastructure raised by states.A total of 5,000 beds across the railway hospital networks are available for Covid patients along with the facility to quarantine 10,500 people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-latest-railways-to-carry-36-lakh-migrants-in-2-600-shramik-specials-in-next-10-days/story-Xc171rY9xsWvNh7IP1Tu0I.html

The Maoists fled into a jungle after a heavy exchange of fire. Later, the two bodies were found lying in the jungle,” said DM Awasthi, director-general of police (DGP), Chhattisgarh. On Thursday, security forces had gunned down two Maoists in an encounter in the Dantewada district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-maoists-killed-in-encounter-in-chhattisgarh/story-RtfD5n54AZPAbXhRnkiIyI.html
23-05-2020||India||Remdesivir tops list of Covid-19 drug contenders, say scientists||With a vaccine still a long distance away, efforts to repurpose old medications used for other ailments provide hope of an early counter to Covid-19, say scientists, placing the antiviral remdesivir on top of the list of possible contenders.     As Covid-19 continues its spread -- crossing 5.2 million cases and 3,38,000 fatalities on Saturday -- several categories of drugs are under clinical trial. Of them, remdesivir, which initially went into trials for treating the deadly Ebola virus five years ago, has shown promise by modestly speeding recovery from Covid-19, experts said.    More than 130 drugs are under experimentation to treat Covid-19, some may have the potential to stop the virus while others may help calm overactive immune responses that damage organs, according to a tracker maintained by the Milken Institute, an independent economic think tank in the US,   “Right now, there is only one effective approach… which is to repurpose already approved drugs for other diseases if they can be used for Covid-19. One example is remdesivir,” Ram Vishwakarma, director of the Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, CSIR, Jammu, told PTI.Remdesivir is helping people recover faster, and is lowering the death rate among critically ill patients, Vishwakarma said, adding that it can be life-saving.  “We do not have time to develop new drugs. New drug development takes five-10 years so we are using existing drugs and conducting clinical trials to find if any of them are effective,“ Vishwakarma said.Some molecules available for treating diseases like HIV or other viral infections can be quickly checked against the novel coronavirus, he explained. If found effective, they can be used against Covid-19 with the appropriate approval from drug control bodies.When drug company Gilead Sciences sought to begin clinical trials for remdesivir to treat the novel coronavirus, it immediately got approval from the US FDA.    According to Vishwakarma, the other drug showing promise is favipiravir, a broad-spectrum antiviral approved in Japan, which is also under clinical trials for its effectiveness against Covid-19.India is also playing its role. The Indian Institute of Chemical Technology (IICT), Hyderabad, has developed the technology to make favipiravir, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) Director General Shekar Mande announced this month.  CSIR is conducting clinical trials for favipiravir, remdesivir and an anti-inflammatory drug called colchicine, which is commonly used to treat gout, said Vishwakarma.  “A number of drug trials are happening in India, which we are doing with pharmaceutical companies,” Vishwakarma said.Of the drugs under trial, remdesivir has shown the most promising results, agreed Subhabrata Sen, professor at the Department of Chemistry in Shiv Nadar University in Uttar Pradesh.   Sen, whose lab is involved in the discovery of biologically active molecules, told PTI that some of the drugs being tested are antivirals, and some are anti-malarials and antibiotics.    Of the antivirals in the tracker list, some are new molecules under trial, whereas others are old drugs being repurposed and tested for their effectiveness against Covid-19.Remdesivir, according to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in April, mimics the genetic material of the coronavirus., When the virus copies its RNA or genetic material, the drug replaces some of the pathogen’s building blocks. According to the authors of this study, the drug prevents new virus copies from being produced.Preliminary results had shown that patients who received remdesivir had a 31 per cent faster time to recovery than those who received placebo.However, another study published in the journal Lancet in April cautioned that interpretation of these findings is limited since the remdesivir study was stopped early after the scientists were unable to recruit enough patients due to the steep decline in cases in China.The authors of the Lancet study concluded that more evidence from ongoing clinical trials is needed to better understand whether remdesivir can provide meaningful clinical benefit. There are other drugs being tested too.Some drugs developed to treat HIV, such as lopinavir and ritonavir, are also being tested to cure COVID-19, Vishwakarma said.  A study published in Lancet this month said a treatment involving a combination of the drugs interferon beta-1b, plus the antiviral combination lopinavir-ritonavir and ribavirin, is better at reducing the viral load or quantity of the virus than lopinavir-ritonavir alone.  But these, too, were early findings, observed only in patients with mild to moderate illness, so the scientists behind the study stressed the need for larger trials to examine the effectiveness of this triple combination in critically ill patients.Another study published last month in the journal Science noted the effectiveness of two small molecule drug candidates named 11a and 11b which could block the SARS-CoV-2 M protease enzyme, which the virus uses to make copies of itself.  The molecules could stop the virus from replicating in monkey cells, and have been found safe for administration in rats and beagles, with the study concluding that both the drugs warrant further studies.  Scientists have also tested the effectiveness of therapies involving the use of antibodies that can bind to some parts of the virus, and block their entry into host cells.  In a study, published last month in the journal Cell, scientists reported that antibodies derived from the immune system of the South American mammal called llamas can block the entry of the novel coronavirus into host cells.  This study found that llamas, which belong to the same category of mammals as camels, produce special kinds of antibody molecules that bind tightly to a key protein on the novel coronavirus.    However, the scientists believe its efficacy is yet to be proved in human clinical trials.  Last week, scientists from the Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Genomics at Peking University in China, revealed a new method to identify multiple antibodies from recovered Covid-19 patients.  Using a single-cell genomics method, the researchers could rapidly identify antibodies from convalescent plasma, a component of patients’ blood.  When the researchers tested these antibodies in mice, they found that some of them could neutralise the virus.  Another team from the University of Washington in the US found recently that a combination of antibodies, including those from a patient who had recovered from the 2002-03 SARS pandemic virus infection, can effectively block the novel coronavirus.One of these molecules, named S309, showed particularly strong neutralising activity against SARS-CoV-2, they said, adding that it can act in combination with another, less potent antibody that targets a different site on the virus. However, these results too are yet to be validated in human clinical trials.  Among other therapeutics currently under trial or in use, Sen said US President Donald Trump’s “game changer” drug hydroxycholoroquine was promising “until it demonstrated serious side effects in the form of cardiovascular complications”, rendering it ineffective.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/remdesivir-tops-list-of-covid-19-drug-contenders-say-scientists/story-aXtePI0YF5WUbehAnUbuuK.html
23-05-2020||India||‘Intent to pick holes’: FM Nirmala Sitharaman on fiscal package criticism||The intent is not to understand but to pick holes, said Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman in response to the questions about the fiscal stimulus package of Rs 20 lakh crore being called “too little, too late”.The FM underlined that the idea is to restart economic activity, put some cash in peoples hands, and infuse liquidity in the system. She was in conversation with party colleague Nalin Kohli answering various facets of the recently announced economic package.“We compared announcements made by other countries. We should be not confused about this. Every country has brought in a basket of things, some fiscal, some monetary...They have also gone into liquidity being infused. We are not different form them. The proportion might vary. We have come with measures which will get more liquidity into the market. People will get money in hand and kickstart demand,” the FM said. Elaborating the government’s approach, the FM said the government has heard everybody and then gone about stimulating economy, restarting companies and giving relaxations. On being told that automobile, retail, entertainment, among others, feel that they got left out, Sitharaman said she did not come up with sectoral references. “Have not excluded anyone. People in any sector can approach banks and get loans,” she said.The banks, she said, have been told to disburse loans and not fear the 3Cs: the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) and the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG). “Have spent time with banks that fear of three 3Cs - CBI, CVC, CAG - should not be in their mind. We discussed threadbare where this fear comes from. If a decision goes wrong, banks are assured that no action will be taken if the decision is not malafide,” said the FM.On the charge that the bulk of announcements focus on poor, the marginalised and that the middle class is not on government’s radar, Sitharaman stressed that it is not the case. “The initial panic was on the EMIs, so worked with the RBI and they responded. I tend to think middle class is there in every segment, like in farm related allied activities, say, you could be part of dairy activity, an intrepreneur,” said the FM.She said relief was also provided to the middle class in the budget announcements and pointed to the income tax changes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/intent-to-pick-holes-fm-nirmala-sitharaman-on-fiscal-package-criticism/story-04p750BzeKZDCPiBEXL6zJ.html
23-05-2020||India||Covid-19 vaccine development at early stage in India; breakthrough unlikely within a year: Experts||As Indian firms scramble to develop a vaccine for coronavirus, experts feel that research in the country is still at a nascent stage and any concrete breakthrough is not likely within a year.The Indian government and private firms have stepped up efforts to develop a vaccine to halt the spread of COVID-19 which has claimed over 3,700 lives with more than 1,25,000 cases in the country.PM CARES Fund Trust has decided to allocate Rs 100 crore for support to coronavirus vaccine development efforts.Referring to a vaccine to fight the virus, a PMO statement had said that it is the most pressing need and Indian academia, start-ups and industry have come together in cutting-edge vaccine design and development.The Department of Biotechnology has been made a central coordination agency to identify pathways for vaccine development. Naming the Indian firms working on vaccines for COVID-19, Gagandeep Kang, executive director of the Translational Health Science and Technology Institute, Faridabad, had said last month that while Zydus Cadila is working on two vaccines, Serum Institute, Biological E, Bharat Biotech, Indian Immunologicals, and Mynvax are developing one vaccine each. The WHO has listed Serum Institute of India, Zydus Cadila, Indian Immunologicals Limited and Bharat Biotech from India among the firms involved in developing a vaccine.Leading virologist Shahid Jameel said India’s vaccine manufacturing capacity is quite remarkable and at least three Indian companies - Serum Institute, Bharat Biotech and Biologicals E are at the forefont, working with international partners to manufacture a vaccine for COVID-19. “Research on a COVID vaccine in India is at a very early stage of development and any candidates are likely to reach animal trials only by the end of the year,” he told PTI. However, Indian vaccine companies have a lot of capacity and expertise, and are likely to play a significant role in bringing new COVID-19 vaccines to the market. This experience is important for institutions, industry and regulators to work together, and prepare for the future, said Jameel, a Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize winner for Science and Technology and the current Chief Executive Officer of Wellcome Trust/Department of Biotechnology’s India Alliance.CSIR-Centre for Cellular & Molecular Biology (CCMB) Director Rakesh Mishra said, “From what we know, we are not at an advanced stage of vaccine development at the moment.” “There are lots of ideas and companies initiating vaccine development process but there is nothing on trial in terms of vaccine candidates,” he told PTI.There are many efforts going on with different approaches like somebody wants to use the whole virus or a particular protein so there are multiple processes being deployed, he said.“Many Indian companies are collaborating with foreign institutions.Other countries are at much advanced stage than us. Some are going into third stage trials. There is no company testing vaccine in India yet and they are in the pre-clinical stage of preparation,” he said.India is quite behind because of a number of reasons like the coronavirus came to India two-three months later so “we did not have the (inactivated) virus to test or even the urgency”, Mishra said, adding that the Chinese and US are quite ahead in the vaccine development. “If a comparison has to be made we are well behind international efforts,” he said.The novel coronavirus strain was isolated and characterised at the Indian Council of Medical Research’s National Institute of Virology, Pune, and the vaccine candidate has been transferred to Bharat Biotech International Limited (BBIL) to develop a fully indigenous vaccine for COVID-19. “Once the vaccine is ready it will go for animal trials to be followed by human clinical trials to assess its safety and efficacy which will take at least one year,” a senior ICMR official told PTI.The BBIL is working towards developing killed virus vaccine which usually provides good immunogenicity, the official said, adding that by entering the body it will create antibody against the infection.The polio drops which are given to children have live attenuated virus, while the polio injection contains killed virus, the official said explaining the different approaches used in developing a vaccine.“The BBIL is continuously working in this direction and as soon as they get the right formulation they will move towards animal challenge studies followed by human clinical trials,” the official said.Kang, in a webinar held by India Alliance, said there are two separate aspects that relates to vaccines of COVID-19, one is to use existing products and the second is to see if new vaccines can be made. “In terms of projects to develop vaccines there are around 90 plus projects around the world that have initiated to develop new vaccines which use different kinds of technologies. Some are using old technologies like make an inactivated virus and spike protein and other using new technologies that allow you to respond rapidly like using messenger RNA vaccines,” Kang said.Every new technology is being applied for making COVID-19 vacines, he said.The Indian firms along with their foreign collaborators are racing against time to develop a vaccine against COVID-19 with over 52 lakh cases and over 3.35 lakh fatalities across the globe.

Earlier this month, another businessman from Mumbai lost Rs12.29 lakh while trying to procure N95 masks and personal protective equipment (PPE) kits online. According to police in MHB Colony, the 35-year-old businessman, a resident of Borivali (West), registered a first information report (FIR) with them on May 21. According to his complaint, he had seen an advertisement for N95 masks. A copy of the FIR was reviewed by HT.“We have freezed the bank account of the accused and the money of the complainant has been saved. We are trying to trace the accused,” said Pandit Thakare, senior police inspector of MHB colony police station.He contacted the person who had issued the advertisement through Facebook Messenger and got his mobile number. The person said he owns a mask manufacturing company in Raigad.According to the complaint, the businessman said he wanted to buy 200,000 N95 masks but the person who claimed to be the mask manufacturer said he had only 100,000 masks and if a booking was not made immediately, he would sell them to someone else. The businessman booked 100,000 masks at a cost of Rs1.65 crore but said he would complete the deal after meeting the seller in person. The seller, however, said this would not be possible because of the Covid-19 lockdown and that he would deliver the masks by truck to Borivali. The businessman asked him to send a video of the masks as proof. The seller sent him a video of a truck containing masks. Based on this video, the businessman sent Rs2.93 lakh in installments as advance payment till May 12. Following these payments, the other person kept delaying the order. After a few days passed, the businessman got angry and the seller said he was cancelling the deal and would return the money. A few more days passed by but the seller did not return the money or deliver the masks. The helpless businessman told him that he would file a police complaint, to which the seller said he was free to go ahead. As more days passed by, the businessman kept contacting the seller, who gave no response. On May 21, the businessman approached police in MHB Colony and lodged an FIR for cheating and impersonation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cyber-fraud-mumbai-businessman-orders-n95-masks-online-loses-rs2-93-lakh/story-hZbuIxV3ogk81cZMjTdZgN.html

According to the India Meteorological Department, mercury levels touched 45 degrees Celsius on Friday in parts of Delhi and the same is expected on Saturday as well. The Met department, in its city weather forecast bulletin, suggests that the temperature in Delhi is likely to rise as high as 46 degree Celsius on Sunday and continue for the following two days along with heat wave conditions. Kuldeep Srivastava, head of the regional forecasting centre of the IMD, said heat wave condition is likely to continue over Delhi-NCR over the weekend due to hot and dry northwesterly winds prevailing over northwest India.The temperature may take a slight dip later next week with a possibility of rain and thunderstorm around Friday (May 29) in the national capital, the weather department predicts. As per the IMD forecast, heat wave conditions are also likely in isolated areas over Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Vidarbha, Chhattisgarh, Coastal Andhra Pradesh and Yanam, Telangana and Rayalseema on Sunday.In large areas, a heat wave is declared when the maximum temperature is 45 degrees Celsius for two consecutive. Severe heat wave condition is when the mercury touches the 47 degrees Celsius-mark for two consecutive days.In small areas, like Delhi, a heat wave is declared when the temperature soars to 45 degrees Celsius even for a day, according to the IMD.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-respite-from-scorching-heat-wave-in-delhi-over-the-weekend-temperature-likely-to-soar-to-46-c/story-Zdpropyky0sYpi6NPkHHEN.html

But this could rise, government officials said.The two countries have lost at least 102 people in the cyclone, the most powerful in over a decade, mostly because of house collapses and electrocution. More than 3 million people were evacuated before Amphan made landfall, preventing a large number of deaths.The cyclone has affected more than 13 million people - some losing houses, crops and lands - and over 1.5 million houses have been damaged, two West Bengal government officials told Reuters. In North 24 Parganas, a district in southern West Bengal, 700 villages were flooded and 80,000 people lost their homes, the Times of India newspaper reported.Hundreds of thousands are in relief camps across the state, the officials said, amid concern that lax social distancing norms could fuel a spread of coronavirus cases.In Kolkata, the state capital, authorities struggled to remove debris from roads and clear trees that fell as the cyclone, packing winds of 133 km (83 miles) per hour, pounded the city of 14 million for hours.The cyclone also destroyed farmland in Bangladesh’s low-lying coastal areas, damage that will likely endanger livelihoods, non-profit ActionAid said.“Communities need urgent support as they are without basic necessities such as food, clean water and materials to rebuild their homes,” Farah Kabir, the country director of ActionAid Bangladesh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cyclone-amphan-loss-estimated-at-13-billion-in-india-may-rise-in-bangladesh-officials/story-ljF5KUNUqlmXwkYLkOSnAP.html
23-05-2020||India||Cyclone Amphan: A house in powerless Kolkata locality is lit with inspiration for aatmanirbhar Bharat||At a time when an entire neighbourhood in east Kolkata has plunged into darkness since Wednesday after cyclone Amphan hit the city, one house in the locality is still lit with power generated domestically, in a true demonstration of the mantra of self-sufficiency.The house belongs to a noted renewable energy expert who has installed rooftop solar panels and produces 1 kilowatt of power when the sun shines brightly.“We can run at least six lights, two fans and the television set. We can even charge our mobiles. The power comes from the solar panels installed on our roof top. I can also operate a small pump to fill the overhead tank during emergency,” said SP Gon Chowdhury, a renewable energy expert and a Green Oscar awardee.The entire locality of Madurdaha in east Kolkata, barring a few pockets, has plunged into darkness since Wednesday when cyclone Amphan had hit with winds gusting up to 130 km per hour. Locals said that a high tension electric wire, which supplied power to the area, snapped when a large tree uprooted by the storm fell on it. Even the local police station is running on an electricity generator.“We are totally aatmanirbhar in power supply in such emergency situation at least. When no other house in my neighbourhood has power connection, we can at least have something to rely upon. We don’t need to depend on the power supply corporation in such crisis,” he added.In April this year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while launching the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan (Self-reliant India campaign), had said that the pandemic has offered India a valuable lesson on the importance of self-reliance and self-sufficiency. The country, each state within it, each district within every state, and each village within every district must aspire to attain the twin goals, he had said.The power in Chowdhury’s house runs on the grid connection in normal situations. But a combination of solar power and grid not just helps him to save power bills but also manage such crises better.“Kolkata being near to the sea is cyclone-prone. The intensity and frequency of cyclones are on the rise because of climate change. I believe every house should have such arrangements to run at least a light and a fan. It doesn’t cost much. On the contrary it helps to save power bills as solar power costs less,” Chowdhury added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cyclone-amphan-a-house-in-powerless-kolkata-locality-is-lit-with-inspiration-for-aatmanirbhar-bharat/story-a3j47UBVdIPvcmMKu8SMhO.html
23-05-2020||India||Half of Delhi’s 92 containment zones turn orange, offer hope of normalcy||Half of Delhi’s 92 active containment zones have not reported a single case in the last 14 days and could turn green over the next fortnight or so, a senior Delhi government official said on Saturday.The city government started notifying localities that report Covid-19 cases as containment zones from late March. Since then, officials said 126 localities were declared as containment zones. Over the last few weeks, authorities have removed 34 of these areas from its containment zones list, reducing the number of active zones to 92.Containment zones comprise apartment blocks, gated communities, slums, streets, even entire neighbourhoods. They are complete quarantine zones and no one is allowed to step out even to buy essential goods such as milk, vegetables, fruits etc. All the entry and exit points and even the internal lanes are barricaded. The authorities allow only a number of selected vendors to supply groceries and other essentials to the neighbourhood with the help of RWA and civil defence volunteers.In these zones, health workers conduct house to house surveys, carry out contact tracing to identify potential cases and carry out tests apart from paying special attention to sanitation in the area.The number of localities under containment zones has increased from 80 a week ago to 92 after more localities reported Covid-19 cases and were placed under a hard lockdown.“Our analysis of the containment zones implies that the focussed action taken by the administration in containment zones is paying off,” a senior government official said.A total of 13 of the 45 containment zones that have not reported any fresh cases over the last 14 days and are classified as ‘orange’ containment zones are in the South District, the official said.If these 45 zones do not report cases over the next two weeks, about 2.5 lakh more people would be free to get back to their normal lives. An overwhelming majority of them are in two containment zones of the Central Delhi District - Sadar Bazar and Nabi Karim - that are home to 1.7 people. People in these two zones have been living under a hard lockdown for over 40 days.Three other containment zones in Central Delhi District - Chandni Mahal, Bara Hindu Rao and Nawabganj - continue to remain under what is classified in the government’s analysis as red containment zone because fresh cases continue to be reported from these areas.Containment Zones that have not reported Covid-19 cases for 14 days:AF Block Shalimar BaghGali No 3 Shalimar VillageH No-62 B Block Gali No-4 Shastri ParkA-97,98,99 Near Buland Masjid, Shastri ParkE-51 Main Road and E-224 Gali No-8 Shastri ParkT-606, Gali No-18 GautampuriBlock No XH No. 303/6 Gali No. 1 to H.

I broke protocol and went to Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti’s residence. They refused to participate under Pakistan’s pressure. Terrorists also threatened yet the election was held successfully,” Malik, who is now the Governor of Goa, told ANI.Omar Abdullah who was released from detention in March after seven months, was quick to rebut Malik on Twitter.“Only naam ka satya not kaam ka. He never tires of lying. Lied to people of J&K before 5th August & lying now. Hiding behind walls of Raj Bhavan protected from defamation suits so feels emboldened to shoot his mouth off.

There’re no differences between the two. Their relationship is like a father-son duo,” Raut told media persons.Later, Raj Bhavan authorities also tweeted about Raut’s courtesy call.The meeting assumes significance as Raut had criticised the Governor for the delay in appointing Thackeray as Maharashtra CM after the MVA unanimously elected him as its leader on November 26, 2019.The Governor on Friday had taken exception to the higher and technical education minister and Shiv Sena leader Uday Samant’s letter to the University Grants Commission (UGC), urging it not to conduct the final year examinations for college and university students because of the unprecedented coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak.Governor Koshyari urged the CM to resolve the issue of holding examinations in the larger interests of the students amid speculation that the incident is the latest point of friction between the MVA and Raj Bhawan.Raut, however, tried to downplay the Samant’s UGC letter row. “The letter is the minister’s personal opinion. While the Governor is also entitled to his own opinion. The issue will be resolved soon,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/relations-between-maha-cm-and-governor-like-father-and-son-sena/story-XuSfYC8zuFHYc5YVyR3rKO.html

23-05-2020||India||‘Bluntly tell government to do its duty’: Chidambaram advises RBI governor||Congress leader P Chidambaram on Saturday advised Reserve Bank of India governor Shaktikanta Das to “bluntly tell the government to do its duty (and) take fiscal measures” to firepower the national economy struggling due to coronavirus and the resultant lockdown imposed to combat its spread.“Governor @DasShaktikanta says demand has collapsed, growth in 2020-21 headed toward negative territory. Why is he then infusing more liquidity? He should bluntly tell the government ‘Do your duty, take fiscal measures’,” tweeted the Congress leader.On Friday, Das admitted that growth will be in “negative territory” this year, the first time anyone in the government or the central bank has admitted that India’s gross domestic product (GDP) will shrink this year.Chidambaram said the “RSS should be ashamed of how the government has dragged the economy into negative growth territory”. Governor @DasShaktikanta says demand has collapsed, growth in 2020-21 headed toward negative territory. Why is he then infusing more liquidity? He should bluntly tell the government ‘Do your duty, take fiscal measures’.The governor cut the policy rate by 40 basis points to 4.0% yesterday, acknowledging the adverse impact on the Indian economy of the coronavirus disease.Das announced the cut, and other measures aimed at keeping “financial markets working, ensuring access to funds to everyone, and preserving financial stability”. Chidambaram, who has also been a former finance minister, hit out at PM Narendra Modi and FM Nirmala Sitharaman for the Rs 20 lakh crore relief package that has “fiscal stimulus of less than 1% of GDP”.The PM had claimed that the relief package was worth 10 percent of the GDP. “Even after RBI’s statement, is the @PMOIndia or @nsitharaman lauding themselves for a package that has fiscal stimulus of less than 1% of GDP?,” said Chidambaram in another tweet.Yesterday, Sonia Gandhi, while addressing a meeting of 22 like-minded parties, also described PM Modi’s May 12 announcement of the Rs 20 lakh crore stimulus package as a “cruel joke” on the country.“This package is about 10 percent of India’s GDP. With this various sections of the country and those linked to economic system will get support and strength of 20 lakh crore rupees. This package will give a new impetus to the development journey of the country in 2020 and a new direction to the Self-reliant India campaign,” said the PM while announcing the package.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bluntly-tell-government-to-do-its-duty-chidambaram-advises-rbi-governor/story-QgKVly0Q1GcYR2Dukt3siJ.html

It is therefore requested that no train should be sent to West Bengal till May 26,” the Bengal CM was quoted as saying by the Press Trust of India.The letter from state chief secretary Rajiva Sinha to Chairman of Railway board V K Yadav on May 22 stated that the state has been severely impacted by Super Cyclone Amphan which caused extensive damage to the infrastructure.At least 86 people in Bengal have died due to Cyclone Amphan. It was the region’s worst weather disaster and the authorities have been scrambling to restore normalcy.West Bengal has received the least number of Shramik Special trains since such service began to ferry migrant labourers back home amid the coronavirus-forced lockdown.Home Minister Amit Shah in a letter had alleged that Bengal was not allowing its migrants to return. Later, it was decided that the consent of the destination state was not required to operate these trains.On Friday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the state and conducted an aerial survey of the Cyclone-hit areas with CM Banerjee. Lending support, Modi said that the central government stands with Bengal in these testing times and announced Rs 1,000 crore for the relief and rehabilitation of people affected by the Cyclone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cm-mamata-requests-centre-to-not-send-shramik-specials-as-amphan-relief-afoot/story-2xj2n6t86t7NoqEavRPMhP.html

23-05-2020||India||Congress releases video on Rahul Gandhi’s interaction with migrant workers||The Congress on Saturday released a video of an interaction between former party chief Rahul Gandhi and a group of migrant workers walking back to a village in Uttar Pradesh from Haryana amid the nationwide Covid-19 lockdown.The interaction took place on May 16 near Sukhdev Vihar flyover in New Delhi. The migrant workers were on their way from Ambala in Haryana to Uttar Pradesh’s Jhansi, a distance of about 600 km.Gandhi met them when they stopped to rest after walking more than 100 km. In the 17-minute video, Gandhi is seen sitting on a footpath with the migrants and interacting with them.Watch this short film in which I speak with India’s real nation builders, our migrant brothers & sisters. https://t.co/As99mjVvytFor almost an hour, he listened to their story and hardships, the discrimination they faced, their reasons for deciding to flee their workplace, and why they were forced to walk back to their homes, their fears, dreams and aspirations, the Congress said.At the request of the group, Gandhi and Congress volunteers organised transport and necessary permissions to get them back safely to their village, the party said.On arrival, they were screened by local health authorities and put into 21-day home quarantine. Soon after the interaction on May 16, the party alleged that Delhi Police had detained the workers.The police, however, refuted the claim. “We have not detained any migrant. Rahul Gandhi came and interacted with the migrants. Later, his supporters took the migrants in their vehicles,” said deputy commissioner of police (southeast Delhi) R P Meena.The migrant crisis has triggered a political slugfest between the opposition Congress and the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), with both sides accusing each other of playing politics on the issue.In his introduction to the video, Gandhi said Covid-19 has hit a lot of people but the worst affected are migrant workers walking thousands of kilometres back to their homes, without food and water and despite being beaten up and threatened. “But they did not stop and continued to walk back to their homes. I want to give you a glimpse of their thinking, fears, dreams, aspirations and their future,” he said.In the video, Mahesh Kumar, a migrant worker of Jhansi, tells Gandhi he and the other workers had been walking 120 km and stopping at regular intervals. “We are helpless. What can we do? We have to walk,” he says.Another construction worker and his family tell Gandhi they would have left for their homes had information about the lockdown been provided four days before it was imposed. The workers remained non-committal about returning to their workplaces, insisting it is important to save their lives. They claimed they had not received any monetary help from the government.The migrants said more than the Coronavirus, hunger is hurting them and that is why they were not afraid of getting killed on the roads.Gandhi concluded the video with a message to migrant workers: “My brother and sisters, you are the strength of this country, you carry the weight of this country on your shoulders. The entire country wants there should be justice (nyay) with you. It is our duty to empower this strength of the country.”Gandhi also demanded that the government should immediately ensure a direct cash transfer of Rs 7,500 to each of 13 crore families.Gandhi’s conversation with this group of migrants was shaped into a documentary and released on the former Congress chief’s YouTube channel, which he launched recently. The Congress said Gandhi has been extremely active on social media for many years now, becoming one of the 10 most followed politicians in the world on Twitter with 14.2 million followers. Over the past few weeks, he has been regularly releasing longer format videos of his conversations with noted experts, such as former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan and Nobel Laureate Abhijit Banerjee.In the pipeline are a number of new video formats and innovative communication approaches that he will use to take his message to the widest possible audience in India and abroad, the party said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-releases-video-on-rahul-gandhi-s-interaction-with-migrant-workers/story-JrQlka9VeRxcDdtGBI4JjO.html

23-05-2020||India||How one Indian company could be world’s door to a Covid-19 vaccine||If the world is to gain access to a vaccine for Covid-19, there’s a good chance it will pass through the doors of Serum Institute of India.Serum Institute, the world’s largest manufacturer of vaccines by volume, is working on several candidates for the novel coronavirus - including potentially mass-producing the AstraZeneca/Oxford university one that has garnered global headlines - as well as developing its own.The efforts are partly being shepherded by Umesh Shaligram, the head of research and development. His employer is a private company but every day, shortly before midnight, he receives a WhatsApp message from the government asking for updates, and about any new hurdles he faces.The message is usually from K. VijayRaghavan, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s top scientific adviser - an indication of the critical, and even strategically important, nature of the race to develop the vaccines the whole world is waiting for.Shaligram promptly responds with a progress report and details any bottlenecks.“Any delays, you just tell them,” said Shaligram, adding the government has been doing everything it can to fast-track clearances, and resolve import delays and other issues.“We have begun to see approvals come through in days, even on a Sunday night, for trials and things like that,” he said, noting some of these processes typically took 4 to 6 months.While most of the attention regarding vaccines typically goes to the pharmaceutical developer, India quietly plays a key role in manufacturing 60%-70% of all vaccines sold globally with the Serum Institute playing a lead role, said the company’s Chief Executive Adar Poonawalla.At the company’s sprawling, 150-acre campus in the western Indian city of Pune, Shaligram and his team are working flat-out. Dozens of buses ferry in hundreds of workers each day to the grounds, which are buzzing with activity even as the city around it remains largely under lockdown.The push comes as the number of cases of Covid-19, both globally and domestically, continue to surge and world leaders look to vaccines as the only real way to restart their stalled economies, even though none have yet been proven to be effective against the coronavirus.Poonawalla, whose family owns he vaccine maker, said scientists, drugmakers and manufacturers were collaborating at an unparalleled scale to spur development and availability.“We are all in a race to battle the disease, there is no one-upmanship here,” he told Reuters, sitting in his office beside his family’s 74-year-old stud farm.Vaccine candidatesSerum, founded in 1966 by Adar’s father Cyrus Poonawalla, has partnered with US biotech firm Codagenix, its US rival Novavax and Austria’s Themis to potentially manufacture three Covid-19 vaccine candidates that are still in development.Another candidate in the works is the experimental vaccine developed by a team at the University of Oxford and now licensed to drugmaker AstraZeneca, with whom Serum are in talks to mass produce the vaccine, which is now in the clinical trial stage.The United States has secured almost a third of the first 1 billion doses planned for the potential vaccine, initially known as ChAdOx1 and now as AZD1222, by pledging up to $1.2 billion.Poonawalla aims to initially produce 4-5 million doses a month, beginning from June, and then gradually ramp up to 350-400 million doses a year.“Hopefully we will build a stock of a few million doses to give to our country and other high-risk areas across the globe come October-November when the trials ought to be concluded,” the 39-year-old said, while giving Reuters rare access to tour his facilities.He added he had been given to understand by the development team that the trials had an 80% chance of success, given that the vaccine is based on a tried-and-tested platform.Based on the information currently available, Poonawalla also said he anticipated AZD1222 would be a single-dose vaccine and not require a booster dose.He sees AZD1222 potentially priced at about 1,000 rupees ($13) per dose in India, but expects it will be procured and distributed by governments without charge.Serum is also working on developing its own in-house vaccine options to tackle the disease, Poonawalla said.Vials, tubes, chemicalsEven if a vaccine does succeed, a treatment to fight Covid-19 would still be required, said Poonawalla, noting some people do not get the desired immune response, even if vaccinated.“You may get mild symptoms, you may get severe symptoms. It depends on your system, but there is a chance,” he added. “Not all vaccines are fully effective.”The Serum Institute produces more than 1.5 billion doses of vaccines every year, for everything from polio to measles.Poonawalla says that gave the company an edge in securing supplies of vials and high-quality chemicals required to make a vaccine in bulk once all approvals are in place.“We have partnered with many of our suppliers to have one to two-year inventories of glass vials and tubing glass stocked in advance, so luckily for us that won’t be an issue.”Any successful vaccine is however bound to be in short supply at first, he stressed.India recorded more than 6,000 new cases of the coronavirus on Friday, bringing its total to over 118,000 cases with more than 3,500 deaths, even as it gradually begins to ease its nearly two-month long nationwide lockdown.There have been more than 5 million infections and over 330,000 deaths reported worldwide.The Indian government stands ready to cover the costs of trials of any vaccine in the country, said Poonawalla, adding that the government had also expressed interest in placing advance orders for a potential vaccine.“We’ve reached out and they have been very positive,” he added. “But we’ve said hold on ... as we don’t want to take government money until we are very confident we can deliver.”Unlocking value in the ‘hype’Serum, one of the few companies ramping up hiring during the health crisis, is also designing a separate facility to make vaccines for pandemic-level diseases that could handle 90% of the current vaccine candidates being developed, beyond just the Covid-19 ones.That facility, which will be ready in the next two to three years, would be able to potentially churn out 700-800 million doses a year, according to Poonawalla.The CEO said he considered taking the company public some years ago to fund some large acquisitions, but changed course when the deals fell through.Now he’s considering a different approach. He is exploring creating a holding entity that will host the company’s pandemic-level technologies, including manufacturing rights, intellectual property and the sale of all of Serum’s Covid-19-related candidates, and selling a minority stake in the venture.“That will unlock value in the main hype,” he said.Poonawalla said he had engaged bankers to test the waters on this, but stressed he would only consider selling a stake to ethical, long-term funds or sovereign funds that do not expect huge returns and want to “make a difference to the world”.“After getting them onboard, I don’t want to be in a situation where I have to charge high prices to give them returns.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-one-indian-company-could-be-world-s-door-to-a-covid-19-vaccine/story-WXQQQGA7BMCkSY0oAyY5vM.html

On Friday, 6,088 new cases were recorded and before that 5,611 infections were seen on Wednesday in the span of 24 hours, health ministry data shows.Also read: Govt expands use of hydroxychloroquine to curb transmission of Covid-19The death toll related to the respiratory disease stands at 3,720 on Saturday after 137 people succumbed in the last 24 hours, the health ministry’s Covid-19 dashboard showed.The Covid-19 recovery rate has gone up to 41% as 51,783 people have been cured as the country entered the sixth day of the fourth phase of the lockdown.According to government data released by NITI Aayog member Vinod Paul on Friday, lockdown 1 and 2 has managed to significantly slow down the virus transmission rate in the country and avert between 1.4 and 2.9 million Covid-19 cases and 54,000 deaths.“The situation would have been much worse, as the data suggests. We have about 95% confidence level on the data generated out of all this analysis, which is proof enough to say that the country is on the right track. Having said that, this kind of analysis is always prone to improvisations, depending on the kind of data that’s fed,” Paul said.Also read| ‘No movement pass needed for people with flight, train tickets’: Noida PoliceThe government has maintained that lockdown was meant to slow the disease transmission so that it got enough time to upgrade the health infrastructure in terms of hospitals beds, testing capacity and trained human resources, among other things, to better manage the coronavirus pandemic.At least five different agencies were involved in data analysis, providing a range between 1.4 and 2.9 million cases averted, and between 37,000 and 78,000 deaths averted.The analysis also shows that much of the outbreak is confined to a limited area. As of May 21, around 80% of the Covid-19 cases were limited to five states, and 90% of the cases were spread largely across 10 states. The states are Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Delhi, MP, Rajasthan, UP, West Bengal, Bihar and Karnataka. In the cities, about 70% of the cases are confined to just 10—Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, Ahmadabad, Thane, Pune, Indore, Kolkata, Hyderabad and Aurangabad.The deaths follow the same pattern, with 95% of Covid-19 deaths being reported from 10 states and 70% from 10 cities.The 10 worst affected states in terms of deaths are Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, Delhi, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. And the 10 cities from where maximum deaths are being reported are Mumbai, Ahmadabad, Pune, Delhi, Kolkata, Indore, Thane, Jaipur, Chennai and Surat.Maharashtra now has more than 44,000 Covid-19 cases and 1,517 people have died in the western state, which is the worst hit in the country. Tamil Nadu has 14,753 infections and Gujarat has reported 13,268 cases of the coronavirus disease so far.With 12,319 Covid-19 cases, Delhi is the fourth worst-hit region in the country. The Union health ministry has also issued an advisory expanding the pool of people to be given anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) as a prophylactic to prevent them from contracting the infection.The earlier HCQ advisory on March 23 cleared its prophylactic use for two high-risk groups: asymptomatic healthcare workers involved in the care of suspected or confirmed cases, and asymptomatic household contacts of confirmed cases.Experts have also said the medicine must not be given to patients suffering from heart diseases, hypersensitivity etc. The drug is also not recommended for children under 15 years of age, pregnant and lactating women.Doctors feel more evidence is required before confidence in the drug can be reinstated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-records-another-biggest-single-day-spike-in-covid-19-cases-tally-rises-to-125-101/story-M6qg8Z6pAEB7UShTFOfZbP.html

A swarm of locusts is headed towards the area from Karauli in Rajasthan, said an official.“We got information that swarm of locusts is in Rajasthan’s Karauli. We have issued an alert in Agra. We have also asked the farmers to take steps like beating drums in the fields and produce smoke to keep the locusts away,” Ram Pravesh, District Agriculture Officer said.“We have procured pesticides and arranged 50 tractors and 3 fire brigade vehicles,” he added.Even as the district is struggling with the Covid-19 pandemic, the threat from possible invasion of locusts added to the farmers’ woes who appealed administration to help them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/agra-administration-issues-alert-to-farmers-over-locust-invasion/story-2ZZ3tFvntdfMMTWvZO5hhN.html

On May 18, he came back to his home from Gujarat unannounced in a hearty surprise, especially for his 68-year-old mother Bachuli Devi. When Karki arrived in the village, residents including the village head Ganesh Kumar were unable to recognise him. Kumar then questioned Karki about his identity and the man named his parents and two brothers. Surprised at learning that it was Karki who had come back, they immediately called his mother. “We failed to recognise him initially but when he named his family members, we were shocked as the boy who had left home had returned as a man, all thanks to the lockdown. When his mother recognised him, it was confirmed that it was Karki who had returned,” Kumar said. “Karki couldn’t meet his father because he is not alive any more. He, however, spoke to his two brothers, one elder and another younger to him. They also accepted him after getting assured that it is him only,” Kumar said. Karki said he was happy about being reunited with his family.“After passing high-school in 1995, I decided to leave home for work. However, I did that without informing my parents and siblings which must have hurt them for which I think there is no forgiveness for me,” Karki said.Narrating his journey after leaving home, he said he first went to Delhi and did menial jobs in different companies for some time. “From there, I went to Himachal Pradesh where I learnt gardening before going to Gujarat which was my last stop and where I was working as an electrician,” Karki said.He said when the lockdown was imposed he decided to return to his family as he still remembered the address of his village. “However, I was not sure whether or not I would be able to find my family there. I just got a pass and arrived here and with God’s grace, I found them and reunited with them after 24 years. I am very happy to see my mother,” he said.Karki says now he won’t “leave his family.”“All this while, I missed my parents and brothers a lot. Now when I have returned, I won’t leave again and stay here only,” said Karki. Bachuli Devi was too happy to see her son again after over two decades. “In 1995, he had left without saying anything to us. His father and I searched him a lot but to no avail after which I lost all hope to ever see him again. But I guess, God is great as I am now with my son as he himself came back,” she said.“Now he will not go anywhere and stay here with me only,” said Devi. Karki has now applied for work under MGNREGA in the village so that he doesn’t have to leave again. “Karki’s MGNREGA job card will be made in the village itself and he won’t leave his family again. At present, he is under mandatory quarantine of 14 days in the primary school near the village where he did his schooling. He will soon be able to live with his family after it gets over,” village head Kumar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-man-who-left-family-24-yrs-ago-returns-home-during-covid-19-lockdown/story-LMsNbBsh6KSojyt9Ba0N0K.html
23-05-2020||India||Odisha brings ordinances to enable contract farming||Odisha has brought in two ordinances that would allow and facilitate the operation of multiple marketing channels through contract farming joining Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and Gujarat who over the last one-and-a-half months have changed their existing agricultural marketing laws for comprehensive reforms in the sector.The Odisha Agricultural Produce and Livestock Contract Farming and Services (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance, 2020, promulgated by the state government aims at registration of farmers with contract farming companies for improving production and productivity by way of land, soil management, seeds, saplings, fingerlings, inputs, feed and fodder, technology and other such services. The ordinance covers sale and purchase of 50 varieties of plant produce and five of animal produce.The Uttar Pradesh cabinet early this month approved a similar ordinance while Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, and Karnataka have promulgated ordinances to relax regulatory aspects of their agricultural produce market committee laws. As agriculture falls under the states list of the Constitution, agriculture marketing in most states is regulated by APMCs established by state governments under the respective acts. APMCs provide infrastructure for the marketing of agricultural produce, regulate the sale of such produce and collection of market fees from such sale.The Odisha ordinance which amends the Odisha Agricultural Produce Markets Amendment Act, 1957 would provide for geographically restriction-free trade and transaction of agricultural produce including livestock across the state and country to give freedom to the farmers to sell their produce in a better manner.Several amendments have been made in the ordinance.The government will constitute a committee called the Contract Farming and Services (Promotion and Facilitation) Committee to review the performance of contract farming in the state and to make suggestions to the government for promotion of contract farming activities.The contract farmer or a group of farmers will get support from the company for improving production and productivity by way of land, soil management, seeds, saplings, fingerlings, inputs, feed and fodder, technology and other such service(s) related thereto as specified in the agreement. A contract-farming facilitation group will be formed for every contract to facilitate in selection of inputs, feeds, good agriculture practices, sorting, grading, packing and delivery of produce and such other pre-production, production and post-production activities of the contracted produce.Every contract or agreement entered into by a market committee for the purchase, sale, lease, mortgage or acquisition of an interest in the immovable property would be executed by its chairperson, vice-chairperson and the secretary.The 1957 act provides that in every market area, there should be a market yard, with one or more sub-market yards, for conducting all marketing activities. The ordinance removes this provision and specified that for every market area, there may be: (i) a principal market yard and sub-market yard managed by the APMC, (ii) a private market yard managed by a person holding a license (granted by the director of agriculture marketing), and (iii) electronic trading platforms (where trading of notified produce is done electronically through the internet).It also said the government may grant a license to establish a private market yard for the trading of notified agricultural produce and livestock, at one or more specified locations in the state. It also said the government may delineate a geographical area for a market committee as a delineated market area. It also disempowered the market committee from regulating the marketing of notified agricultural produce and livestock in its delineated market area. Unlike the 1957 act, the new ordinance allows the establishment of a farmer-consumer market yard for the marketing of notified agricultural produce in the retail subject to conditions that the consumer would not purchase more than the specified quantity of agricultural produce at a time.The new ordinance allows collection or aggregation centres in the proximity of farmlands set up by companies with linkages to retail chain, or processing or export unit or premises.The ordinance provides for the appointment of the director of agricultural marketing by the state government. The director will be responsible for the promotion of contract farming, trading and connected activities for the notified agricultural produce, regulating private market yards and electronic trading platforms. He may also grant licenses for these activities.It also provides that market fee for trading under licenses granted by the director of agricultural marketing will be levied as prescribed by the state government.However, farmer leader Ashok Pradhan said the ordinance would not help the farmers in any way.“It’s a big racket. In the first year of contract farming, the offers would be attractive. After that, the big companies would exploit the small and marginal farmers,” Pradhan, a farmer leader from western Odisha, said.“The government regulatory mechanism is bound to get lax after a couple of years and farmer will suffer,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-brings-ordinances-to-enable-contract-farming/story-N10F6PcgfYCS2QKvkyYqRJ.html
23-05-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||The big middle-seat-in-aircraft question in India doesn’t concern armrests, but why the ministry of civil aviation believes it is alright to seat people there.One reason could be that it doesn’t really help the cause of social distancing. Most studies suggest that six feet is the optimal distance between people (to prevent transmission of the coronavirus that causes Covid-19), although there are some that claim that some exhalations could travel 14 feet, maybe even more. Removing the middle seat isn’t going to increase the distance between passengers to six feet. Then, there’s the question of rows. The distance between two rows, even in full-service (as opposed to low-cost) airlines isn’t six feet. Sure, every bit of social distancing helps, but to what extent? (Answer: I don’t know, but it is a question that merits study).Reducing the number of passengers by insisting on keeping middle seats empty is also something that will wreak havoc on the economics of flying — another factor that may have played a role in the ministry’s decision.QUESTION OVER MIDDLE SEATSOne of the reasons the government hasn’t kept the middle seat in flights out of bounds for passengers could be that it doesn’t really help the cause of social distancing. Another factor could also be that removing seats will wreak havoc on the economics of flying.The one legitimate question is why the civil aviation ministry is allowing people over the age of 75 to fly. Sure, there are a lot of healthy people over that age out there (and more power to them), but with trends around the world indicating a clear correlation between age and Covid-19 fatality rates, shouldn’t the ministry have taken at least this decision on the basis of science (and in the interest of a very vulnerable section of the population)? Instead, it seems to have left this to the good sense of individuals.Screening, social distancing in the airport, and wearing masks will help, no doubt, but only to some extent given that most people infected by Sars-CoV-2, the virus which causes the coronavirus disease, remain asymptomatic. Rapid testing is perhaps the only failsafe way of ensuring a traveller isn’t infected (or is immune), but many of these tests are still in their infancy in terms of sophistication and efficacy. It isn’t difficult to foresee a future where a quick test, perhaps at an automated kiosk, is part of the standard check-in procedure at airports, nor one where people who are immune to the disease have cards validating their eligibility to travel — but that isn’t going to happen right now (or very soon).WHY ALLOW THE ELDERLY?A legitimate question is why the civil aviation ministry is allowing people over the age of 75 to fly. With trends around the world indicating a clear correlation between age and Covid-19 fatality rates, shouldn’t the government have taken this decision in the interest of a vulnerable section of the population?Another question that comes up repeatedly in the context of air travel in the midst of the pandemic is the quality of air in aircraft. Almost all modern airplanes have air that is of very high quality, thanks to high-end filtering systems. The air in aircraft is cleaner than that in homes (most home air conditioners use very basic filters) and perhaps even offices and malls. I personally find the air inside aircraft a little too dry, but it is safe. The surfaces inside aircraft are probably as safe as surfaces in other public places — which means they aren’t safe at all. Anyone who wants to fly should be equipped with disinfectant wipes. I’d stopped using them a few years ago — most are not compostable or biodegradable and are very bad for the environment — but have gone back to them with a vengeance. THE FUTURE OF FLYINGIt isn’t difficult to foresee a future where a quick rapid test is part of the standard check-in procedure at airports, nor one where people who are immune to the disease have cards validating their eligibility to travel — but that isn’t going to happen very soon.I used them liberally during a trip I made down south in February (causing some raised eyebrows among the cabin crew and yes, I also wore a mask) but on the last trip I made by air, a week before the first lockdown, I found many others using them.Given that only those who absolutely have to fly will, I think it’s wonderful to have the option.As for the armrest, modern aircraft etiquette has the answer — the middle seat gets both armrests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-lDRzQYFv900GNOFywBBRNP.html

And on Thursday and Friday technicians at several places could not reach the laboratories due to blocked roads.“In some areas, ambulances carrying the samples could not reach the laboratories... All this brought the testing numbers down,” the health department official said.West Bengal reported at least six more Covid-19 fatalities since Thursday, taking the death toll in the state to 193, a bulletin issued by the department said.Four deaths were reported from the city and two from North 24 Parganas district, it said.There are at least 1,846 active Covid-19 cases in West Bengal, while the total confirmed cases stood at 3,332, the bulletin said.The count of those recovered from the disease in the state is 1,221.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-testing-in-bengal-hit-as-technicians-fail-to-reach-labs-due-to-cyclone-amphan/story-Gx1kZCpGEnYk09ARyi1GXI.html

The conviction disallows him from contesting elections until he is acquitted. Judge Vibhu Bakhru said wider opinion was that persons charged with crimes ought to be disqualified from contesting elections and therefore, it would not be apt to stay the conviction. The judgment also said amendments to the Prevention of Corruption Act (PC) Act could not be applied for offences prior to changes in the act’s provisions. Section 13 (1) (d) of the act had stated that if a public servant, by corrupt or illegal means or otherwise abusing his position as a public servant, obtains for himself or for any other person any valuable thing or pecuniary advantage, he would be guilty of “criminal misconduct”. This particular section was repealed in 2018, which meant that a demand of illegal gratification was no longer a necessary ingredient of the offence of criminal misconduct.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-hc-denies-stay-on-conviction-of-former-jharkhand-cm-madhu-koda/story-15eUT0LicI2aPzTZfExSUJ.html

The Tripura chief minister said that his government is screening all passengers returning to Tripura from elsewhere in the country apart from testing random samples among them. He said 14 days of home quarantine is mandatory for people, even if they test negative for Covid-19.“The maximum numbers of tests are being done to ensure safety of all. So, the people, who are not undergoing tests on their arrival from other parts, may also bear the coronavirus. As it appeared, most of the positive cases in Tripura have been found to be asymptomatic,” Biplab Kumar Deb said while emphasizing on the importance of maintaining the 14-day home quarantine as a must.Tripura had a total of 173 Covid-19 patients, of whom 148 have recovered. In the last few days, six people who returned from other states were found positive with coronavirus. “Around 40,000-50,000 people will be returning to the state from different parts of the country via trains and buses. We need to adopt more precautions to prevent transmission of Covid-19 at community level. Nobody should take a risk when it comes to Covid-19,” Biplab Kumar Deb said. He also informed that the government has constituted Corona Awareness and Monitoring Committees at the village level to ensure safety. The committees would also ensure 14-day home quarantine for all people coming from other states. Deb himself would be the chairman of the state-level committee. He further informed that his government is expecting Rs. 4,802.88 crore under five major heads out of the total Rs. 20 lakh crore package announced by the Centre earlier in May. These include different components like direct support to farmers and rural economy, support to urban poor, support to agriculture, industries, entrepreneurs, hike in MGNREGA allocation and borrowing limit. The state is also expecting to receive Rs. 7.35 crore out of a total of Rs 13,343 crore central package for prevention of animal diseases. Besides, the state is also hopeful it will get Rs. 10 crore out of the Rs. 10,000 crore allocated for formalizing micro food companies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/impossible-to-test-all-incoming-passengers-says-tripura-cm-appeals-for-home-quarantine/story-D2PHR9rCMN4y5xNudt7ZlN.html
23-05-2020||India||RBI predicts economy to shrink, cuts key rate||The Monetary Policy Committee of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) cut the policy rate by 40 basis points to 4.0% on Friday, acknowledging the adverse impact on the Indian economy of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and the lockdown imposed to combat its spread.A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. RBI has so far cut its policy rate by 115 basis points since the crisis began to a historic low.RBI governor Shaktikanta Das also extended the moratorium on payment of term loans (this includes mortgages or housing loans taken out by individuals, even personal loans) by another three months to August 31.The moves are expected to make loans cheaper, and give borrowers a break from monthly loan repayments at a time when they are financially stressed. The interest for these six months will be treated as a loan that will have to be paid by the end of this financial year (March 31).Interestingly, Das admitted that growth will be in “negative territory” this year, the first time anyone in the government or the central bank has admitted that India’s gross domestic product (GDP) will shrink this year. Chief economic advisor Krishnamurthy Subramanian has maintained that GDP growth will be 1-2% this year and the International Monetary Fund predicted, on April 14, that India would grow by 1.9%. Goldman Sachs on Sunday said it expected India’s economy to contract 45% on an annualised basis in the quarter ending June, and by 5% in the financial year.“The end-May 2020 release of NSO [National Statistical Office] on national income should provide greater clarity, enabling more specific projections of GDP growth in terms of both magnitude and direction,” Das said.Das announced the cut, and other measures aimed at keeping “financial markets working, ensuring access to funds to everyone, and preserving financial stability” in a digital video address on Friday, his third since the lockdown began on March 25.Stock-market investors weren’t impressed but bonds rallied. The Bombay Stock Exchange’s benchmark Sensex fell 0.84% to 30,672.59 points at the close of trading.The yield on the most-traded 2029 bonds dropped seven basis points to 5.96% at the close after falling more than 15 points intraday, while that on the new 10-year notes slid three basis points, Bloomberg reported. Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions. The rupee fell 0.5% to 75.9650 per dollar.Das said that the economy has been hit hard by a collapse in demand and disruption in supply. Private consumption has fallen sharply, he added. But India’s foreign exchange reserves remain $487 billion, the governor said — an indication that the country is unlikely to face a crisis of the nature it did in 1991 when this was down sharply and barely adequate to fund a few days of imports. The current reserve is adequate to fund a year of imports, Das said.India’s central bank has previously announced measures to tackle the economic crisis resulting from the pandemic (and the lockdown) on March 27 and April 17. According to the government, around ~8.01 lakh crore crore of the ~20 lakh crore Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan (Self-Reliant India Campaign) announced by the government through last week is accounted for by monetary measures of the RBI.On Thursday, the central bank announced measures aimed at improving the functioning of markets, to support exports and imports (the first is down by 60% in April and the second by 58%, the governor pointed out), to ease financial stress, and to help state governments financially. These include exemptions from borrowers being classified as defaulters and the loans as non-performing assets for another three months, and an extension of the timeline for resolution of bad loans.The governor admitted that inflation in pulses, milk and vegetable oil has accelerated, primarily because of supply disruption, but added that the monetary policy committee expects this to ease in a few months, although he cautioned that early remedial measures may be needed in the case of pulses. Growth, he added, remains the bigger concern, and while the second half of the financial year could see some “growth impulses”, much would depend on how the pandemic plays out.Das reassured markets that as inflation comes out, it would open up room for RBI to do even more.When the “chips are down”, everyone, everywhere in the world turns to the central bank, Das said.RBI “remains vigilant”, he said, to “use all its instruments and even fashion new ones to address “the dynamics of an unknown future”.Two government officials, requesting anonymity, said the finance ministry may persuade public sector banks (PSBs) to quickly transmit the rate cut to borrowers. Lower EMIs for purchasing apartments and automobiles would boost demand. “Raising consumption through lower EMIs is one of the strategies of the government to boost growth,” one of the officials said. Niranjan Hiranandani, president of the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (Assocham), said: “There has been a total collapse in demand in both urban and rural India since March 2020. The continued proactive measures taken by RBI will help address these issues and revive the economy in the second half of the year.” Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO) president Sharad Kumar Saraf said the RBI measures would provide “a much needed respite” to the industry. The measures announced by the central bank would “definitely reduce pressure on cash flows and liquidity for entities”, said Rajosik Banerjee, partner and head of the financial risk management practice at KPMG India.Mihir Vora, director and chief investment officer at Max Life Insurance, cautioned that credit risk-aversion in the financial markets may persist; high-rated borrowers will continue to get easy funding and lower-rated entities struggle to raise funds. “More direct fiscal support to businesses, workers and stressed segments will be needed to, 1) contain job losses, 2) stimulate the demand-side of the economy, 3) encourage private sector investments to counter the demand shock due to the domestic lockdown and fall in exports,” Vora said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rbi-predicts-economy-to-shrink-cuts-key-rate/story-iTnO0AmJrV6xFzVXax7KeO.html

Even though various agencies have conducted the analysis but the results more or less are indicative of the same conclusion that lockdown has managed to significantly slow down the virus transmission rate in the country,” said Paul.“The situation would have been much worse, as the data suggests. We have about 95% confidence level on the data generated out of all this analysis, which is proof enough to say that the country is on the right track. Having said that, this kind of analysis is always prone to improvisations, depending on the kind of data that’s fed.”At least five different agencies were involved in data analysis, providing a range between 1.4 and 2.9 million cases averted, and between 37,000 and 78,000 deaths averted.The analysis also shows that much of the outbreak is confined to a limited area. As of May 21, around 80% of the Covid-19 cases were limited to five states, and 90% of the cases were spread largely across 10 states. The states are Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Bihar and Karnataka.In the cities, about 70% of the cases are confined to just 10 -- Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, Ahmadabad, Thane, Pune, Indore, Kolkata, Hyderabad and Aurangabad.The deaths follow the same pattern, with 95% of Covid-19 deaths being reported from 10 states and 70% from 10 cities.The 10 worst affected states in terms of deaths are Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, Delhi, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. And the 10 cities from where maximum deaths are being reported are Mumbai, Ahmadabad, Pune, Delhi, Kolkata, Indore, Thane, Jaipur, Chennai and Surat.“What data tells us is currently is that it is an urban disease as mostly cities have been affected so far, and our interventions have to be accordingly planned at the level of cities, municipalities and even at the block level. However it is easier to contain the spread in villages because of low population density,” said Paul.The government has always maintained that lockdown was meant to slow the disease transmission so that it got enough time to upgrade the health infrastructure in terms of hospitals beds, testing capacity and trained human resources, among other things ,to better manage the outbreak.Even though India is well-prepared to handle the situation, Paul says now is the time to be extra cautious.“We were under lockdown so far, but now that we are lifting it gradually, there will be challenges in curtailing the transmission because the virus is in circulation and we have no immunity against it. Also, it is not a matter of days, weeks or months but much longer, so we have to be extra careful and strictly follow the preventive measures such as maintaining physical distancing, following hygiene practices, wearing masks etc. The idea is to make it difficult for the virus to spread,” says Paul.Experts agree that gains have been made, and what shape the outbreak takes now depends on human behaviour.“Mathematical modelling is usually a way of telling what could have been the case if certain measures were taken to prevent disease from spreading during an outbreak. Lockdown was a measure to ensure our health system wasn’t burdened and it has achieved its purpose. Now the onus lies on people to consolidate the gains made,” said Dr AC Dhariwal, former director, National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/curbs-averted-up-to-78k-deaths-govt/story-WZvTor9LWE8KDeHxs1RVyH.html
23-05-2020||India||Army chief visits Ladakh after border skirmish at LAC||Army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane on Friday visited Leh, the headquarters of 14 Corps in Ladakh, for a security review of the sensitive sector amid tensions between India and China along the disputed Line of Actual Control (LAC), two officials said on the condition of anonymity. He returned to Delhi later in the day.The visit came a day after India rejected China’s allegation that Indian troops initiated tensions and crossed LAC in Ladakh and Sikkim sectors and accused the Chinese army of hindering patrols on the Indian side.Soldiers on both sides are showing restraint and efforts were underway to de-escalate, said one of the officials cited above.India and China have deployed additional troops, especially in Ladakh’s Galwan Valley, after a face-off near Pangong Tso on May 5-6. India bolstered its troop levels after the Chinese side brought in reinforcements and also reportedly pitched tents and erected temporary positions in the Galwan Valley as part of its efforts to establish a presence there.China’s foreign ministry first accused Indian troops of trespassing across LAC on Tuesday, saying Beijing had to take “necessary countermeasures” after the Indian army allegedly obstructed normal patrols by Chinese troops.A government spokesperson on Thursday said, “Any suggestion that Indian troops had undertaken activity across LAC in the western [Ladakh] sector or the Sikkim sector is not accurate.”HT was the first to report on May 10 about tensions flaring up between India and China in north Sikkim, where 150 soldiers were involved in a standoff a day earlier. Four Indian and seven Chinese soldiers were injured during the confrontation.Scores of soldiers from the two countries clashed near Pangong Tso on the night of May 5-6 and a few were injured in the scuffle that involved around 250 men. While a flare-up was avoided as both armies stuck to protocols to resolve the situation, tensions spread to other parts of eastern Ladakh, including the Galwan Valley.Talks between local commanders have failed to ease tensions and diplomatic channels are at work to end the standoff, officials said. The current situation along LAC marks the first major flare-up since the 73-day standoff between India and China at Doklam near the Sikkim border in 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-chief-reviews-ladakh-situation/story-YwgqYyq7Aq1hENEZsJlaoI.html
23-05-2020||India||Protection or threat? Experts say Aarogya Setu poses national security risk||Data of millions of Indians, collected through the Aarogya Setu app, could be vulnerable to threats from adversarial state and non-state actors and pose a national security challenge, according to cybersecurity experts and former intelligence officials. This, they believe, is due to issues in India’s security capabilities and cyber hygiene practices. Indian government officials reject these concerns, saying their encryption standards have adequate protection against data or network breaches.This difference of opinion is at the heart of a controversy surrounding tracing apps that store sensitive personal data to aid in the fight against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) -- with one side saying that the potential risks are either non-existent or a small compromise; and the other arguing that the information is far more valuable and dangerous than governments comprehend, not just from a privacy perspective but also on the security front.Aarogya Setu is meant to trace close contact between people so that they can be reached in the event any of them is infected with Covid-19. According to government officials, at least 110 million people have signed up on it, and while a rule making it mandatory for office-goers to install it was partially relaxed last week, on Wednesday the government said air passengers must install it if they are taking a flight. “National databases in general are a huge cause of concern. Sometimes, leaks don’t even appear on the dark web. They are simply scooped away for doing passive profiling of citizens of adversarial countries,” said Pukhraj Singh, a cyber threat intelligence expert, who was involved in the detection of the breach at the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant last year.The concerns expressed by Singh were endorsed by two former intelligence officers who have held senior positions in the National Intelligence Grid (Natgrid) and the National Technical Research Organisation (NTRO) – two of India’s main agencies tasked with digital intelligence gathering. The threat is particularly serious due to the nature of information involved, one of the former intelligence officers cited above said. He added that users part with information that can directly identify them, where they have been, and what health conditions they suffer from, making it a target for common cyber criminals who can offer these up on the dark web for a price, as well as state-backed hackers for espionage.Government officials again rejected these concerns, saying that their data encryption standards have adequate protection against breaches.A VERITABLE GOLD MINESince its launch in early April, Aarogya Setu has had at least 106 million sign-ups, according to government officials. The process requires users to declare their mobile numbers, name, gender, age, and whether they belong to a set of high-risk professions, such as law enforcement or health care.The application then routinely asks people to “self-assess” their health by answering questions such as whether they have any of the symptoms associated with Covid-19 or if they have a history of diabetes, hypertension or obesity – factors that make people more susceptible to the disease.The second retired intelligence official described three scenarios in which such breaches can be dangerous. “The first risk comes from any hacker who wants to profit from the data. For instance, someone can leak the data about the number of people who identified as diabetics and sell it to a company making insulin for targeted ads, or to an insurance company to deny claims.” He said that the second is what the government itself can do. “Unfortunately, no matter what legal protocols you put in place, the sovereign can always find ways to use this data for purposes that they were not meant for.”But it is the third use which potentially is the most hazardous, he said. “The third, and the highest risk, is from geopolitical adversaries who can use this data for a wide variety of reasons. They can misuse it to identify and target particular citizens, such as a bureaucrat or a politician, or they can simply scare people into not trusting their government with any data”, this person said, asking not to be named.“Most state-initiated hacks are not even known to the public. What you hear about normally are amateurish attempts. The really sophisticated ones have been very hard to detect,” this person added.Cyber criminals are known to use such data to determine multiple point of information about an individual, which can then be used to bypass identity checks for crimes such as bank account theft. IMPENETRABLE MYTHFundamentally, data breaches can happen in two ways. The most common method is deceiving someone into divulging sensitive information or giving a hacker privileged access – a tactic commonly known as a phishing attack. Such tactics have been used in the past by hackers to obtain back-door access – by fooling, for instance, an IT management staff – to sensitive networks used by banks or government offices.The other is code-based attacks on computer networks, which usually make use of flaws in software, or what are known as exploits. In some of the most sophisticated attacks, the exploit is done through a zero-day vulnerability – a backdoor that only the attacker knows about.Both these methods have proven to work – often in combination – to compromise the more secure of systems. Zero-day hacks have been carried out by state-linked hackers and is a risk that cannot be ruled out, the second intelligence agency veteran quoted above said.Till now, officials have not detected such an attempt on health data in India. “The data is fully secure; our encryption and data storage policies will ensure that there is no breach. Sensitive data of our citizens is kept in a manner where there is no unauthorised access to the data,” said Abhishek Singh, CEO of MyGov, one of the government agencies involved in the Aarogya Setu project. RISE OF FAKE APPsThere is a third risk factor associated with the Aarogya Setu push – modified or impostor applications that look like Aarogya Setu but are spying tools. These have been spread using the same techniques as phishing, often through messaging applications or via links sent over WhatsApp. While this might not expose the entire database, it could compromise individuals who are successfully targeted.The Union home ministry issued a warning in late April — the same month Aarogya Setu was launched — about such fake apps being sent to Indian soldiers and paramilitary personnel through WhatsApp, media reports said last month.“In the current version of the app, there is no protection against an internal modification. So, it’s quite easy to create a modified version of the app. Of course, a modified version of Aarogya Setu can become viral. Especially now, (since) Aarogya Setu is a big topic in India,” said Baptiste Robert, a France-based cyber security researcher who is more commonly known by his nom de guerre Elliot Alderson.Robert first found flaws in an earlier version of the Indian app that allowed access to internal programme files, which could lead to an attacker accessing the data the Aarogya Setu collects.“The distribution of a modified app creates new threats. Depending on the modifications done, it can either kill the purpose (of Aarogya Setu) and remove the tracing functionality, (or) it can be used by attackers. By adding malicious code, they can infect victim’s phones and steal their personal info,” Robert added.On May 14, researcher at anti-malware product developer ESET shared screenshots showing one such impostor application with the same logo and name as the real Aarogya Setu, but was actually spyware. “It’s SpyNote - RAT (remote access trojan) tool. It’s not created by IN govt... [Spynote can] log user keystrokes, steal SMS, wipe device, steal contact list, take camera pics, record audio, install additional apps, reset device PIN and make calls,” wrote Lukas Stefanko,MyGov’s Singh said impostor applications were being spread and people were being asked to download it, “which is not right”. “These imposter apps cannot come on PlayStore and we have ensured that. People usually download top-rated apps from PlayStore and the Aarogya Setu is highly rated,” said Singh. SECURITY IMPLICATIONSResearcher Pukhraj Singh recounted several of the past hacks (see box) that extracted government personnel data, medical records and banking information. “It has hugely upset American intelligence collection programs, especially the ones relying on HUMINT (human intelligence). Maintaining intelligence cover has become close to impossible now,” he said.“The problem is that we see databases in isolation. (But) they are like lobes to a nervous system. The more databases adversaries have access to, the more they are able to control the system,” Singh said, adding that India needs to “undertake a kind of cost-benefit assessment and a whole-of-government posture review to know what we are really doing with the data that is being collected”.The second of the two former intelligence official quoted above concurred with the position. “Every country will have a certain capability to manage its database. Unfortunately, in the Indian administration, networks and systems are managed by L-1 contractors, or a service provider who offered the lowest prices. This creates a lot of inefficiency,” he said, adding that the issue has persisted for decades.The second former intelligence official added: “We must build up an ecosystem based on very strong encryption, for both data security as well as network security. Protection of such databases depend on the capabilities in this fields. Unless you have very strong encryption frameworks made domestically, you will keep having all kinds of vulnerabilities.”The other significant issue is cyber hygiene. In the past month, Robert brought to light open databases with details of citizens meant to be under home quarantine in three states: Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka. The databases contained locations of these individuals and their names in some cases. All of these were removed after the French researcher tweeted about.The second former intelligence official said stronger efforts for data minimisation and anonymisation can be made in the interim.Data minimisation refers to the principle of collecting only the basic information required for a tool’s purpose. In Aarogya Setu’s case, privacy activists say the collection of location records, profession details and granular demographic data does not follow this principle.(With inputs from Amrita Madhukalya)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aarogya-setu-protection-or-threat/story-QmpSP3H60ohkLV3l5ywhBI.html
23-05-2020||India||UP, Rajasthan in fresh row over migrants’ buses||The Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan governments sparred on Friday over a Congress attempt to arrange 1,000 buses for the transport of migrant workers walking to their homes in Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled UP after being stranded by the lockdown imposed to stop the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).Rajasthan Congress president and deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot accused the Yogi Adityanath government of engaging in petty politics by denying entry to the vehicles which the Congress wanted to run at its expense.The UP administration claimed many of the buses were Rajasthan-registered vehicles and accused the Congress of misusing the government machinery in the neighbouring state. The Congress eventually summoned back the buses. “Taking help doesn’t diminish someone’s stature. UP government did politics and blamed Congress. We condemn it,” Pilot told journalists in Jaipur. Congress president Sonia Gandhi had decided that the party’s state units will bear the expense of the buses, which were arranged by general secretary Priyanka Gandhi. The buses weren’t arranged by the Rajasthan government, but by the Congress for transporting stranded migrants, Pilot said.“The entire country watched the UP government’s attitude, they levelled charges on the opposition, that too for helping. They created unnecessary hurdles, arrested people and registered FIRs, which shows a narrow mindset that is regrettable,” Pilot said.In Lucknow, deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma said the Rajasthan government had charged UP the full cost of arranging 90 buses for transporting students stranded in the coaching school hub of Kota. He claimed that Priyanka Gandhi’s offer of providing buses to migrant UP workers was a political stunt and her show of empathy for them was a sham.“On the one hand you do not have the courtesy to drop our students stranded in your state at the UP border and you instead ask us to pay the cost for ferrying students, on the other hand you try to show off your sense of public service and sensitivity by offering buses for migrants in UP,” Sharma said at a press conference.He demanded an apology from the Congress “for misleading the nation, especially the migrant workers, for its dual character.”A large number of the 1,000 buses that the Congress had offered were unfit for use or uninsured or fake, the UP government claimed. Rajasthan agreed to provide the buses for Kota students on condition that UP will bear the cost and asked for it in writing. “Shouldn’t the Rajasthan government have showed the courtesy of dropping these students free of cost on the UP borders at least if not at their home,” asked Ashok Katariya, the state minister of transport.Rajasthan transport minister Pratap Singh Khachariyawas said the fuel bill for transporting the students from Kota to UP had come to around Rs.36 lakh, of which the UP government had till date paid Rs. 19 lakh. He said the Rajasthan government spent Rs 2.6 crore in all.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-raj-in-fresh-row-over-migrants-buses/story-k4Fq7u9FdC62vHRDonuMXO.html
23-05-2020||India||Govt expands use of hydroxychloroquine to curb transmission of Covid-19||Even as medical journal The Lancet published a paper on Friday saying there were no confirmed benefits of anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) being given to Covid-19 patients, the Union health ministry issued an advisory expanding the pool of people to be given the medicine as a prophylactic to prevent them from contracting the infection.“The Joint Monitoring Group and National Task Force have now recommended the prophylactic use of HCQ in the following categories: a) all asymptomatic healthcare workers involved in containment and treatment of Covid-19 and asymptomatic healthcare workers working in non-covid hospitals/non-covid areas of covid hospitals/blocks; b) Asymptomatic frontline workers, such as surveillance workers deployed in containment zones and paramilitary/police personnel involved in Covid-19 related activities; and c) Asymptomatic household contacts of laboratory confirmed cases,” the advisory said.The earlier HCQ advisory on March 23 cleared its prophylactic use for two high-risk groups: asymptomatic healthcare workers involved in the care of suspected or confirmed cases, and asymptomatic household contacts of laboratory-confirmed cases.“As a prophylactic drug, the medicine has shown results in India which is why it is advised for a larger group now. The Lancet paper that has come out will have implications for treatment regimen not prophylaxis,” said an Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) official, who did not wish to be identified.ICMR began a ‘demonstration study’ on the efficacy of HCQ as a prophylactic medicine against Covid-19 in March to see if it will prevent people, especially those in close proximity with a positive case from acquiring the infection.“What we have been doing in India is different from the studies done anywhere else in the world in the sense that we have been checking whether it could work as a prophylactic medicine, whereas everywhere else it was given to positive patients as a treatment option. The results look like favourable in our population,” said the official.The Joint Monitoring Group under the chairmanship of Directorate General of Health Services, the government of India, and representatives from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), ICMR, National Centre for Disease Control, etc reviewed HCQ’s prophylactic use in the context of expanding it to healthcare and other frontline workers.“A retrospective case-control analysis at ICMR has found that there is a significant dose-response relationship between the number of prophylactic doses taken and frequency of occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 [that causes covid-19] infection in symptomatic healthcare workers who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Another investigation from 3 central government hospitals in New Delhi indicates that amongst healthcare workers involved in covid-19 care, those on HCQ prophylaxis were less likely to develop SARS-CoV-2 infection, compared to those who were not on it,” said the fresh health ministry advisory.“The benefit was less pronounced in healthcare workers caring for a general patient population. An observational prospective study of 334 healthcare workers at AIIMS, out of which 248 took HCQ prophylaxis (median 6 weeks of follow up) in New Delhi also showed that those taking HCQ prophylaxis had lower incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection than those not taking it.”“At National Institute of Virology, Pune, the report of the in-vitro testing of HCQ for antiviral efficacy showed reduction of infectivity/log reduction in viral RNA copy of SARs-CoV2,” said the health ministry document.In an earlier interview to HT, Union health minister Harsh Vardhan also said early reports from the pharmacovigilance programme indicate that there were no unexpected spikes of adverse reactions from the use of HCQ in the country.Experts have also said the medicine must not be given to patients suffering from heart diseases, hypersensitivity etc. The drug is also not recommended as prophylaxis for children under 15 years of age, pregnant and lactating mothers.For treatment purposes, the ICMR expert said, “It must be reviewed for treatment regimen in view of the emergence of new strong evidence. But for us in India, it is for prophylaxis.”Doctors feel there is some more evidence required before confidence in the drug can be reinstated.“We are not giving the drug now as enthusiastically as it was given in the beginning given the kind of evidence before us. We will have to look into all aspects of the evidence available. We will talk to experts on this,” said Dr Yatin Mehta, a critical care specialist at Gurugram’s Medanta Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-expands-use-of-anti-malaria-drug-to-curb-transmission/story-OLcIsC5PZSZTLjXWGoyf8M.html
23-05-2020||India||3.5 million enrol for MGNREGS work amid migrant exodus||The number of enrolments for work under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) surged almost twentyfold in the period from April 1 to May 20, coinciding with an exodus of migrant workers from the big cities to homes in the hinterland following the Covid-19 lockdown, according to government data and officials in multiple states.Some 3.5 million people applied for work under the federal programme during the period, compared to just 180,000 in the same duration last year, according to the MGNREGS website, but there may not be enough work to accommodate all the applicants.Only about 1.5 million applications for new job cards were received during the entire financial year of 2019-20. The number of cumulative job applications as of May 20 was 43.3 million and only half of them have been provided work so far, according to the government data. MGNREGS , under which at least one member of every rural household is guaranteed 100 days of manual work a year, acts as pointers to the state of the rural economy and the living conditions of the marginalised sections in the absence of any real-time data.The surge has coincided with the exodus from cities of migrant workers left jobless by the lockdown imposed on March 25 to check the Covid-19 pandemic in late March. Tens of thousands of workers walked or cycled back to the countryside; Indian Railways has been running special Shramik trains transport them home beginning May 1.The government has allocated an additional Rs 40,000 crore to MGNREGS amid the increase in demand for work under the programme. Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Odisha, where a bulk of the migrant workers have returned to, have reported the maximum increase in demand for jobs. Officials in these states said the demand for the work has been highest since the scheme was launched in all districts in 2008. Many states have directed district authorities to create additional work and get approvals for it within a fortnight in view of the surge. District authorities are expected to budget annually for MGNREGS on the basis of the applicants for new job cards in February and March.Jharkhand’s special MGNREGS commissioner Sidharth Tripathy said the situation is different this year as the demand for work started growing in April once the migrants started returning home. “Nobody had anticipated such a situation,” Tripathy said. He added that the administration had been engaging MGNREGS workers in pre-monsoon works such as maintaining of ponds or digging of wells. “We have also taken additional road construction work to employ MGNREGS workers...”His Rajasthan counterpart, P C Kishan, said normally there is a slight increase--3 to 5%--in new job applications when the financial year starts in April. “This year, we have issued two lakh [200,000] new job cards since April 1, which is equal to those issued in entire 2019-2020 [financial year]. This is not normal.”Bihar’s rural development department secretary Arvind Kumar Chaudhary said the government had employed MGNREGS workers for flood management works since the first week of May. Officials in Odisha said they will employ migrant workers to deal with the damage Cyclone Amphan has caused in the state as well as for pre-monsoon and road construction works.According to the MGNREGS website, Rajasthan has provided the maximum number of new jobs cards-- 210,000--over the first 45 days of this financial year. “We are focusing on the rural job guarantee scheme to provide financial security to rural populations in the current scenario. This has resulted in 24.31 lakh [over 2.4 million] labour engaged in MGNREGS,” said Rajasthan’s deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot.Chhattisgarh, which has employed over 2.8 million people under the scheme, plans to increase the number of days of work if needed. “We are clear if people want, we would provide additional work under MGNREGS for workers in our state even if we have to pay from our own pocket,” said chief minister Bhupesh Baghel.Baghel, who has asked the Centre to increase the employment days in a year from 100 to 150, said district administrators had been asked to ensure that migrants get work under MGNREGS. Uttar Pradesh, India’s most populous state that accounts for over half-a-million new job seekers, has asked districts officials to accommodate additional MGNREGS workers. “Providing work for all workers may not be possible. We would provide them employment in a staggered manner so that more families can be covered ...,” said an official on condition of anonymity.The job guarantee scheme provided a fallback option for returning migrant workers. Ratnakar Yadu said he was working with a construction company in Chhattisgarh’s Bilaspur town, but when work stopped after the lockdown, he enrolled in MGNREGS at his village. “At least I am doing some work and earning some money,” he said.Kashiram Ahirwar, 38, a resident of Madhya Pradesh’s Tikamgarh district, too, is hoping for work under the programme. “As no construction activity is going on and harvest season is also over here, my only hope is MGNREGS,” he said. Balveer Ahirwar, 23, a resident of Ladwari in Tikamgarh, said his brother returned after losing his job due to the lockdown in Delhi after a week-long journey. “We have no money left and five quintal wheat from my father’s farm also did not fetch enough money. We have been pleading to the sarpanch [village head] to give us work. But he says that works have not been sanctioned...”Jabbar Ahmad, 43, who returned to Bihar’s East Champaran from Surat, said he is looking for a job under the scheme. “I am a trained worker for a cotton factory but I am looking for a job under MGNREGS...”East Champaran district magistrate Shirsat Kapil Ashok said many trained people, including some contractual teachers, were asking for work under MGNREGS. Reetika Khera, a development economist at the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, said the additional allocation for the scheme is a welcome decision but added that around Rs.15,000 crore will be used to clear pending dues from the last financial year. “The states need to create enough works to employ all those who have been enrolled. If needed, MGNREGS workers can be used for agriculture purpose as there is a shortage of farm labourers.”Activist Nikhil Dey said the number of new job applications under MGNREGS since March are almost equal to those received in a year. “Apart from the migrants returning home, even locals are seeking jobs under MGNREGS because of lack of employment opportunities anywhere,” he said.(With inputs from state bureaus)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-5mn-enrol-for-mgnregs-work-amid-migrant-exodus/story-WvcKNyIwjuKggt6aT9PANL.html
23-05-2020||India||Second Parliament official tests positive, annexe to be sanitised||A senior Parliament official working in editorial and translation (E&T) services has tested positive for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), people familiar with the matter said.The official had been going to work until May 12 on the fifth floor of the Parliament annex building, which is about 100 metres away from the main Parliament building.This is the second case of a Parliament staffer testing positive for Covid-19. A senior housekeeper tested positive last month. Unlike the housekeeper, the E and T official had attended his office regularly before he was sent into quarantine, the people cited above said.The case, according to one official, was reported on Thursday and since Friday morning, arrangements were being made for sealing a block of offices on the fifth floor of the annex. Thorough sanitization of the entire building is being undertaken, but the functioning of the Parliament secretariat is not expected to be disrupted.Efforts are also on to identify people who have worked with the official and to keep them under observation.Last month, when government offices reopened at the end of lockdown 2.0, the Parliament secretariat too opened with just one-third of its staff and strict health norms in place.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/second-parliament-official-tests-positive-annexe-to-be-sanitised/story-SnhPD9Dl0ZXM9xr2Tg8psN.html
23-05-2020||India||Harsh Vardhan takes over as WHO executive board chief||Union health minister Harsh Vardhan on Friday took charge as the chairman of the World Health Organization (WHO)’s 34-member executive board at its 147th session to become the third Indian to currently occupy a senior position in the global health agency.Vardhan will chair meetings of the board but the assignment isn’t a full-time one. He will be chairman for a year. The other Indians in senior roles at WHO are Dr Soumya Swaminathan, chief scientist, WHO Geneva, and Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, who is serving her second five-year term as the regional director, South East Asia Region, which is one of six WHO regions.Harsh Vardhan succeeded Dr Hiroki Nakatani of Japan. Apart from being India’s health minister, Vardhan also heads the ministries of science and technology, and earth sciences in the BJP-led NDA government.“I congratulate Dr Harsh Vardhan for being elected as the chair of the executive board of WHO. He will lead the board to the next level of excellence. I wish every success for the new chair,” said Nakatani while handing over the post. The World Health Organization is a specialised agency of the United Nations responsible for international public health. The agency is headquartered at Geneva in Switzerland. The 34-member executive board of the agency is technically qualified in the field of health, with members usually being elected for a three-year term, and each of them being designated by a member state. The mandate of the executive board is to advise on the listed matters, and implement decisions and policies of the World Health Assembly.India is one of the 194 member states at WHO, Dr Harsh Vardhan will hold the post for a year (2020-21). “I am sure that constant engagement with member states and other stakeholders will reinforce reforms and help accelerate progress towards achieving sustainable development goals and universal health coverage with the most productive, efficient and targeted utilisation of resources…” said Harsh Vardhan while taking charge.“My heart is heavy as lakhs of people have lost their lives to this deadly pandemic. Despite making great strides in science and technology we are still at the mercy of these pathogens. This is a great human tragedy and the next two decades may see many such challenges. All these challenges demand a shared response, because these are shared threats requiring a shared responsibility to act,” he also said.WHO is governed by two decision-making bodies: the World Health Assembly and the Executive Board. The Health Assembly is WHO’s decision-making body, and consists of representatives from its 194 member states.The member states or countries of WHO are divided into six groups that represent six different regions in the organisation: African Region; Region of the Americas; South-East Asia Region; European Region; Eastern Mediterranean Region; and Western Pacific Region.“Dr Harsh Vardhan has a rich experience in public health. He is the pioneer of India’s successful pulse polio program and has been in the forefront in the fight against tobacco and many other issues. The world can now gain from his expertise and experience,” said SEA regional director, Dr Singh.The post of the executive body’s chairman is held by each group by rotation.The executive board usually meets twice in a year. In January, the main board meeting is held to set the agenda for the World Health Assembly that is held in May.A second shorter meeting is held in May, immediately after the World Health Assembly, to discuss administrative matters.India became a part of WHO on January 12, 1948. The first session of the South East Asia Regional Committee was held on October 4-5, 1948.“My association with WHO dates back to early 1990s; I have even served as an advisor to the organisation and feel deeply honoured to have trust and faith of all of you,” Harsh Vardhan added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/harsh-vardhan-takes-over-as-who-executive-board-chief/story-kKCCYlRd4OCEkq5isKeArM.html
23-05-2020||India||Power of states usurped by Centre: Oppn leaders||Alleging that the Centre has “unabashedly usurped powers” vested in states, and undermined “the constitutionally guaranteed federal democracy”, 22 opposition parties on Friday presented a 11-point charter of demands to the Union government to deal with the coronavirus disease pandemic and the economic distress resulting from the national lockdown.These demands include a direct cash transfer of Rs 7,500 to all families outside the income tax bracket and the immediate restoration of parliamentary functioning and oversight.At the end of what was its first meeting after the lockdown was imposed on March 25, the Opposition sharply criticised the government’s handling of the pandemic — with Congress president Sonia Gandhi, who chaired the meeting, alleging that power was concentrated in the Prime Minister’s Office, there was disregard for the plight of migrant workers, and the lockdown had been initiated with no exit plan. In a statement at the end of a marathon meeting held through video-conferencing, the “like-minded parties” said they believe that this is neither the time for the central government to indulge in showmanship nor one-upmanship.“It is important that the Centre reaches out and engages in a dialogue with all political parties in a systematic manner, listen seriously to the suggestions that we have to make, activate parliamentary institutions like standing committees, and be genuine in helping the states financially and otherwise,” the statement added.The meeting was attended by former Prime Minister and Janata Dal (Secular) leader HD Deve Gowda; three serving chief ministers — Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray, Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee, and Jharkhand Mukti Morcha’s Hemant Soren; former Jammu & Kashmir chief minister and National Conference leader Omar Abdullah; Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) president Sharad Pawar; Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) chief MK Stalin, Communist Party of India (Marxist) general secretary Sitaram Yechury, Communist Party of India (CPI) general secretary D Raja; Sharad Yadav of the Loktantrik Janata Dal (LJD), and Tejashwi Yadav of the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), among others.Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi also participated in the meetings along with other senior Congress leaders.However, the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) skipped the meeting despite being invited. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) was not invited.The Opposition has demanded, among other measures, the free distribution of 10kg food grains to the needy; increase in number of days under the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme to 200; free transportation for all migrant workers to their home states; accurate and relevant information on Covid-19; reversal of all unilateral policy decisions, particularly the annulment of labour laws; release of substantial funds to state governments; communication of the Centre’s exit strategy from the lockdown; and a clear and meaningful economic strategy focused on revival and poverty alleviation.Earlier, the Congress president, in her opening remarks, said the initial optimism of the Prime Minister that the war against the virus would conclude ‪in 21 days has turned out to be misplaced. “It seems that the virus is here to stay until a vaccine is found. I am also of the view that the government was uncertain about the criteria for lockdowns, nor does it have an exit strategy. Successive lockdowns have yielded diminishing returns,” she claimed.Gandhi claimed that the defining image of the Covid-19 pandemic has been that of millions of migrant workers, many with children, walking hundreds of kilometres, without money, food or medicines, desperate to reach their home states. She claimed that the government has disregarded the opposition’s demands and suggestions. “Our pleas have fallen on deaf ears...There is not even pretence of consultation with stakeholders or debate in Parliament. We deplore these unilateral moves.”Gandhi said a number of renowned economists are predicting that 2020-21 will end with negative growth of up to minus 5%. “The consequences will be catastrophic. That the present government has no solutions is worrying but that it has no empathy or compassion for the poor and vulnerable is heartbreaking,” she added. “The government has also abandoned any pretence of being a democratic government. All power is now concentrated in one office, the PMO. The spirit of federalism, which is an integral part of our Constitution, is all but forgotten.” Thackeray — who attended an umbrella Opposition meeting for the first time since the new political alignment took place in Maharashtra — blamed the Centre for doing politics, even as states run by the opposition parties were cooperating with the Centre. Banerjee also said that this was not the time to do politics or discriminate between states, according to a person familiar with the meeting proceedings. For his part, Pawar said the state governments are relaxing the conditions of lockdown but factories are not in a position to resume as workers have migrated to the villages. “We need to strategise to bring them back,” he said.The BJP dismissed the Opposition’s claims and allegations.Union minister Prakash Javadekar said that at a time when the whole country should be fighting the pandemic together, opposition parties were continuing with negative politics. “The Congress and their allies used to question the central government about why the lockdown has not been extended and now they are asking why the lockdown is being extended. First they used to ask us why are people not being allowed to return to their native states, now when nearly 50,00,00 people have reached their native places they are trying to politicise the issue by sending a few buses for transporting people,” he said.Mumbai-based political analyst Abhay Deshpande said the meeting represented an attempt by the opposition parties to form a pressure group to ensure adequate financial aid from the central government to non-BJP ruled states. “They want to collectively put pressure on the Centre to give adequate assistance to opposition-ruled states,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/power-of-states-usurped-by-centre-oppn-leaders/story-zOPDBSxHIsidgCuy5wCR5M.html
23-05-2020||India||Herd immunity is still far: Global data||One out of five people in New York City and one in 10 in Wuhan have been infected by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and developed antibodies that protect them against reinfection, but the proportion of immune population is still too low even in outbreak epicentres for it to confer herd immunity that slows the spread of infection, according to data from several studies done around the world.“Based on data from many countries that have done serosurveys, it is clear that only a small proportion of 5%-10% people have been exposed to this virus. It will be difficult to achieve herd immunity without a vaccine, the number of people who get ill or die may be unacceptably high,” said Dr Soumya Swaminathan, chief scientist, World Health Organization.Building herd or mass immunity slows or stops the spread of an infectious disease within a population, usually through vaccination. It is an established public health strategy that works by vaccinating at least 70% of people within a community, who then don’t fall sick even when exposed to the virus. If a great majority of people are protected, there are very few unprotected people left to infect, which ends disease transmission and protects even those who are not protected.“A number of seroprevalence studies (that look for antibodies to Covid-19 and assess the overall level of population exposure) have now been completed in both the US and elsewhere, and they suggest that outside of cities hit by the pandemic, overall infection rates and exposure remain relatively low,” tweeted @ScottGottliebMD, former commissioner, US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA), on Friday. People who have experienced even mild coronavirus disease develop neutralising antibodies primed to seek and destroy the Sars-CoV-2 virus that leads to Covid-19 and protect them against reinfection. “From what we’ve seen so far, the virus produces a strong immune response and the antibodies produced offer long-term protection, which is why the epidemic had declined wherever it has peaked. If you look at the curves and draw a perpendicular from the peak, half the cases are before the peak and half are after. It’s a mirror image, and herd immunity is not achieved at the peak, but when the curve hits the X-axis after numbers decline,” said Dr T Jacob John, former professor of virology and emeritus professor at Christian Medical College, Vellore, Tamil Nadu.Serological or blood tests can be done at the point of care for mass testing of people at risk, including health workers, to identify those who are already immune, so they can be deployed to care for infected patients to minimise the risk of Covid-19 outbreaks in hospitals.With the National Institute of Virology in Pune developing an Elisa-based rapid test to detect IgG (Immunoglobulin G) antibodies for surveillance, it is possible to scale up antibody testing to determine the extent of the pandemic.“India so far is only testing for the virus, and not antibodies. We won’t know the extent of subclinical infection in the general population until we test everyone for IgG, which are antibodies that appear roughly after the third week. One Elisa-based IgG kit can test 90 plus samples in one go, so it’s an excellent tool for surveillance,” said Dr John.Community surveillance of the general population can track if the pandemic has spread from urban to rural areas in India flowing mass migration from cities. “Multiple asynchronous epidemics are happening in India, so the peaks will vary, but we believe it will be in end July-early August,” said Dr John.Antibody test kits arrived in India on April 16 after several delays, but the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) asked states to suspend antibody testing on April 27 following its evaluation of kits of Guangzhou Wondfo Biotech and Zhuhai Livzon Diagnostics in field conditions showed results with wide variations in sensitivity. Apart from surveillance to detect asymptomatic cases, antibody tests help screen healthcare workers and others in essential services to determine if they have developed antibodies and can continue or return to work.Since then, the Central Drug Standard Control Organisation of India has approved USFDA-approved test kits from pharma companies Roche Diagnostics and Abbott Laboratories, which are expected to arrive in India by the end of the month.The Roche test, called Elecsys Ant-SARS-CoV-2, has 100% sensitivity and can identify Covid-19 antibodies in the blood sample of someone exposed to the disease in less than 20 minutes two weeks after the infection. Early data from an ongoing study funded by Abbott Laboratories showed its ID NOW rapid test, which is also used in the White House, accurately detects the virus 94.7% of the time, and correctly gave negative results 98.6% of the time, the company said in a statement on Thursday.“Herd immunity will not happen till the infection peaks and falls, so until we have a vaccine, masks, hygiene, and social isolation are the only protection from infection,” said Dr John.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/herd-immunity-is-still-far-global-data/story-YC1wm9ctrOcziPyKVwCAcM.html
23-05-2020||India||Ministries pitch proposals for work-from-home framework||Three days of work from the office and two days from home, reduced childcare leave and Make in India laptops for government employees are among the suggestions the Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances (DARPG) has received for its work-from-home framework in the wake of the Covid-19 crisis. Over two subsequent review meetings on Wednesday and Thursday, the department received feedback from nearly 80 ministries and departments for the draft proposal pitched on May 13. “Two meetings were held where feedback has been received from over 110 stakeholders,” a senior official who was part of the meetings said on condition of anonymity . “The data will be analysed before a final policy is decided, but most are in favour of work-from-home for at least some time now.” According to the DARPG Twitter handle, the department’s additional secretary V Srinivas chaired the second interministerial meeting, comprising representatives from 37 ministries, on Thursday. “The Information and Technology ministry has suggested an alternate day week, that is, three days from office and two days work from home,” the senior official cited above said. On Monday, the Department of Personnel and Training issued instructions for alternate day work weeks with 50% attendance and staggered timings for officials and staff below the rank of deputy secretary. “A recommendation of reduced childcare leave, as most officials are working from home and Make in India laptops has also been made,” said a second official. Encryption for laptops, time discipline and a dress code were also discussed at the meeting. “We also talked about creating a small office space at home,” said the first official. The department is waiting for a response from the ministry of home affairs on security features because a number of confidential documents may have to be accessed remotely. “We have recommended that office laptops be used as they are encrypted,” a DARPG official said, adding that the use of private laptops is also being discussed. A further response from the Department of Expenditure is also awaited as financial sanctions need to be sought to provide reimbursement for data usage by the officials, a recommendation made in the work-from-home framework. The official added that various logistics have to be worked out, including creating a support inventory such as cloud space for files and determining the level to which the virtual private network will be extended. The draft proposal had recommended moving files to the digital platform, e-office, which has been the fulcrum of all government work during the Covid-19 lockdown. However, it suggested that the National Informatics Centre and MHA evaluate existing security protocols to remotely access classified files. It also asked that the ministries and departments consider allowing eligible officers and other staff to work from home for 15 days a year as a policy decision for the future.“The response has been very encouraging,” said the DARPG official. “We have received comprehensive comments and the overall push is to continue to work from home.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ministries-pitch-proposals-for-work-from-home-framework/story-KXP4V0rJv6eZGtLGsxjIvI.html
23-05-2020||India||Supreme Court seeks govt’s reply on plea to ban Zoom video calling app||The Supreme Court (SC) on Friday sought the response of the central government and Zoom Video Communications on a plea seeking a ban on the use of the Zoom videoconferencing software, citing privacy and security concerns.The petitioner, Harsh Chugh, who is a part-time tutor, said the use of Zoom should be banned for both official and personal purposes until a law addressing data security issues is put in place.“Issue notice returnable in four weeks”, the bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde said.In April, the home ministry issued an advisory stating that the Zoom app, which government officials have been barred from using, was “not safe” for use by private individuals.The government’s missive came after the national cybersecurity agency – Computer Emergency Response Team of India (CERT-in) – flagged the cyber vulnerability of the popular app, being used by tens of thousands of professionals working from home due to the Covid-19 pandemic.Officials pointed out at the time that the NIC (National Informatics Centre) platform was being used for most government video conferences.Government officials have been asked not to use any third party app and services for meetings. The CyCord portal was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in December 2018 for sharing all cyber-related matters among law enforcement agencies, government organisations and other stakeholders.The Zoom app, which is owned by the US-based Zoom Video Communications, enables video conferences and online chat facilities. The use of the platform is free for video conferences with up to 100 participants within a 40-minute time limit. For longer or larger conferences with more features, paid subscriptions are available.Chugh told the apex court that the sudden boom in the use of Zoom application because of the lockdown restrictions, which were imposed to prevent the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak, has severely compromised security in cyberspace by leaking the personal data of its users.“Poor privacy and security of the application have enabled the hackers to get access to the meeting, classes, and conferences being conducted online through this application. Zoom is reported to have a bug that can be abused intentionally to leak information of users to third parties,” the plea said.The petition pointed out that the Zoom application saw exponential growth in its users from 10 million in December 2019 to 200 million in March 2020 due to the pandemic-induced lockdown restrictions.The petitioner alleged that the application has made false claims that its calls are end-to-end encrypted.Chugh also claimed that Zoom practices data hoarding, including mass storage users’ personal data.The petitioner pointed out that various high courts across the country are still using the application, despite the MHA advisory.“The Bombay high court recently decided to live stream hearing on a trial basis. The bench of Justice GS Patel made the hearing of listed matters on April 9 publicly accessible. The hearing in the court of Justice Patel could be accessed by anyone and everyone via the Zoom application. Similarly, the Kerala High Court has also started live-streaming of court hearings through this application”, the plea stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-seeks-govt-reply-on-plea-to-ban-zoom/story-2ZLzxAd6Vkp3DbNyiNV4YN.html
23-05-2020||India||Cyclical curbs, relaxations likely to help||A cycle of 50 days of hard lockdown followed by 30 days of easing may be effective in reducing the number of Covid-19 deaths and hospitalisations while not hobbling the economy beyond repair, a 16-nation modelling study has suggested. This approach, detailed in a paper published in the European Journal of Epidemiology on Wednesday, may prolong the pandemic to beyond 18 months but will reduce R0, the average number of people infected by a single patient. The study comes as India is in the fourth phase of a nationwide lockdown that began on March 25. India was one of the 16 countries for which the modelling was done and the cyclical lockdown-easing approach was seen to reduce deaths by 98%, compared to a scenario with no intervention. “This intermittent combination of strict social distancing, and a relatively relaxed period, with efficient testing, case isolation, contact tracing and shielding the vulnerable, may allow populations and their national economies to ‘breathe’ at intervals--a potential that might make this solution more sustainable, especially in resource-poor regions,” said Rajiv Chowdhury, a global health epidemiologist at the University of Cambridge and the paper’s lead author.In their study, a group of scientists found that strategies focusing on suppression of the disease--such as enforced physical distancing and strict measures--are more effective than those aimed at mitigation--general social distancing, hygiene rules, case-based isolation and shielding of vulnerable groups. The study considered three scenarios in four bands of countries: high, upper-middle, lower-middle and low income. India was in the third band, along with Bangladesh, Pakistan and Nigeria. The first scenario modelled the impact of no measures and predicted 7.8 million deaths across 16 countries and 200-day duration of the pandemic. In India, around 4.6 million deaths were predicted. The R0 was assumed at 2.2.The second scenario modelled a rolling cycle of 50-day mitigation followed by a 30-day relaxation. This strategy was still insufficient in controlling the number of deaths and intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalisations and predicted 3.5 million deaths in 12-18 months. In India, 2.09 million deaths were predicted. The R0 was assumed at 0.8The final scenario involved a rolling cycle of stricter, 50-day suppression measures followed by a 30-day relaxing. Since more individuals remain susceptible at the end of each cycle, such an approach would result in a longer pandemic, lasting beyond 18 months in all countries. However, a significantly smaller number of people--just over 130,000--would die. In India, the predicted deaths stood at 15,379. The R0 was assumed at 0.5“There is no simple answer to the question of which strategy to choose. Countries--particularly low-income countries--will have to weigh up the dilemma of preventing Covid-19 related deaths and public health system failure with the long-term economic collapse and hardship,” said Oscar Franco from the University of Bern, Switzerland, and another author of the report. Chowdhury highlighted a specific takeaway for India. He said that in regions with large populations where wide-scale testing and rigorous contact-tracing for a prolonged time are not feasible and critical care infrastructures (ICU beds) are inadequate, the proposed cyclical suppression-relaxation strategy could be considered to strike a balance between keeping the ICU bed requirements within a manageable limit and allowing the local economy to open intermittently. “If local containment measures are done efficiently [as shown in Kerala] or current plans of zonal lockdowns of the hotspots are well managed [with no significant second wave nationwide], this cyclical strategy may not be needed in such settings,” he added. Some Indian experts disagreed and said other forms of dynamic lockdown may be more useful.Snehal Shekatkar, a professor at the Centre for Modelling and Simulation, Savitribai Phule Pune University, said several lockdowns scattered over a period of about two years might drastically hamper the economy, rendering it impractical. “Moreover, during any lockdown, it is extremely difficult to maintain the basic reproduction number R0 below 1 as assumed in the study. Also, ramping up testing is known to lead to shortening of a lockdown, and the study has not considered this possibility. It is quite possible that even for high R0, increased testing would make such long and strict lockdowns unnecessary,” he said. He suggested an alternative--proposed by other studies including by the Indian Scientists’ Response to Covid, a coalition of 500 leading scientists--called a staggered lockdown, in which subpopulations experience alternate lockdowns. “This has been shown to be much more effective and economically feasible than periodic lockdowns,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cyclical-curbs-relaxations-likely-to-help/story-ISVC23kSnozqlF0d9RvstI.html
23-05-2020||India||Bihar, Jharkhand and Odisha record big spikes as migrant workers return home||The eastern Indian states of Bihar, Jharkhand and Odisha have seen the fastest growth in Covid-19 cases since May 1, when the railways started bringing back stranded migrant workers, compared to any other state in India, shows Covid-19 data from different states.However, compared to the western Indian states of Maharashtra, Gujarat and Rajasthan and southern state of Tamil Nadu, the absolute number of the cases in the eastern states is still very low. A reason for this could be the very low number of tests per million of the population conducted in these eastern states compared to the more developed western states. In Bihar, where the number of those testing positive for Sars-CoV-2, which causes Covid-19, has seen a fivefold jump, the total number of positive cases on Friday was 2,105, which is less than the daily increase in positive cases in Maharashtra (on Friday, this was 2,940). Jharkhand, where the cases have seen a fourfold increase in the past 20 days, the total number cases are 309, less than the average per day increase of Covid-19 cases in Gujarat (on Friday, this was 363). In the neighbouring tribal state of Odisha, the cases between May 1 and May 20 went up nine times, taking the total number of cases to 1,189.Nationally, between May 1 and May 20, the number of Covid-19 cases has increased from 37,262 to 1,18,226. The biggest contribution to the spike came from Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Gujarat.In these eastern states, one of the reason for the sudden increase in cases has been the return of migrant workers, especially from the Covid-19 hot spot areas of Delhi, Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Surat and Chennai. In Bihar, close to 57% of the total cases were of the migrant workers, in Jharkhand it was 48.5% (upto May 21) and in Odisha over 95% total cases from May 1. In Jharkhand, besides migrant workers, many cases were linked to the Tablighi Jamaat event in Delhi. The state’s first case was a Malaysian woman, who was part of 22 member group who arrived in Ranchi after attending the event. The group had gone to two mosques in Ranchi’s Hindpiri locality. Further contact tracing in the area led to discovery of a number of cases. Of the 105 reported in Ranchi, over 80% were concentrated in Hindpiri locality. On May 1, the railways started Shramik Special trains bringing passengers back and workers were also sent back through buses. Many workers also came back by trucks and walked back to their homes in these states. Since their return, these eastern states saw a spurt in Covid-19 cases, pushing the administration to put lakhs of people in institutional quarantine.Till Thursday, Bihar has set up 10,353 block quarantine camps, where 7.45 lakh people were living for the stipulated period of 14 days. It is here that the samples of symptomatic persons and others are taken randomly for testing. “Preventing the migrants from directly going home, after reaching the state, has helped us contain the spread of the virus,” said Anupam Kumar, secretary information and public relations department.As Bihar has scaled up testing, more Covid-19 cases have been reported. Of the 58,905 samples tested till Friday, 3.57% (2105 cases) had reported positive. This ratio was 1.79%, as on May 3, official data showed. “In the last one week, (May 15-May 21), the number of new infections has grown by an average 13% every day,” said Bihar’s principal secretary, health, Uday Singh Kumawat. In Jharkhand, close to 2.90 lakh people, a majority of them migrant labourers, have been staying in institutional and home quarantine. On May 1, the number of such people was only 93,813. Of the 2.90 lakh people, who have been observing quarantine, 71,123 are in institutional quarantine, shows official health bulletin. “It has been noticed that many workers, who were tested positive, had arrived from red zones like Mumbai and Surat,” said Dr A K Singh, state president of Indian Medical Association (IMA).As on May 20, the Covid-19 cases in Jharkhand were spread over 12 of 24 districts. Ranchi district alone had 83 cases then. The pandemic swiftly gripped the other nine districts as migrant workers started reaching home. Of the 309 cases, 147 were of migrant workers who came in Jharkhand after May 5, a bulletin released by the state health department of May 21 said. The seven day growth rate of the disease in Jharkhand stood at 5.84% against the national average of 5.36% and the doubling period too came down to 12.20 days against the national average of 13.28 days. Singh said Jharkhand needs to scale up testing to reflect the true impact of the Covid19 outbreak.Between May 1 and May 21, more than 2.2 lakh migrant workers returned to Odisha from different states. Ganjam where over 72,000 migrant workers arrived from Gujarat, the number of Covid-19 cases has crossed 300 while Jajpur, another district with significant migrant returnees from Bengal the numbers have gone past 200. “Odisha’s Covid-19 number is expected to rise to 10,000 by June,” said Odisha’s Covid-19 spokesperson, Jayanta Panda, adding that all cases have been reported from quarantine centres and containment zones. Unlike the western states with a high number of Covid-19 cases, Bihar, Odisha and Jharkhand have low testing rates. As of May 21, Bihar was testing 466 out of every one million people, said Kumawat. Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar has directed officials to ramp up testing facilities from an average of 2,000 to 10,000 per day, and to test as many migrants as possible. This rate for Jharkhand was 570 per million people and 2660 per million people in Odisha. According to worldometers.info, India is testing 1973 people per million population.Of the 530,000 migrants that arrived till May 18, Bihar had tested only 1.57% (8,337) of them. Jharkhand has tested about 2% of 2.5 lakh migrant workers, who have returned. This rate for Odisha was 30% of the 2.2 lakh workers, who have returned. As Covid-19 cases surge, health officials say they are now not much perturbed by the rising numbers. “If Covid-19 infection will not rise then there will be no herd immunity. For herd immunity, two-thirds of people in a locality or area need to be exposed, which is going to happen,” said Panda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-jharkhand-and-odisha-record-big-spikes-as-migrant-workers-return-home/story-6PfyWmDaJPbpkgeZpqTVhN.html
23-05-2020||India||Govt sounds alarm as locusts enter Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh||Crop-munching locust swarms have entered Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana, and Madhya Pradesh a month in advance and pose a major threat to standing crops and vegetables, the Union environment ministry warned in a statement on Friday. It said Rajasthan is the most affected state and added the swarm has entered earlier than expected. “States are adopting various means for controlling the swarm,” the statement said. Soumitra Dasgupta, the ministry’s additional director general (wildlife), said though they do not deal with locusts, they were informed by ground staff and wildlife wardens about the swarms. “So, we have shared the information from the western states,” said Dasgupta.HT on Friday reported India is on the alert for the desert locusts, which according to the UN pose a “severe” risk to the country’s agriculture this year. A top pest-monitoring agency has also flagged signs of an early-than-usual summer invasion of the species of grasshoppers from across Pakistan and prompted the government to consider importing equipment from the UK, apart from deploying drones, satellite-derived tools, special fire-tenders and sprayers at pre-identified border locations.Locusts can fly up to 150 km daily and a one square km swarm can eat as much food as 35,000 people in terms of weight in a single day.A surge in locust attacks since last year is being attributed to favourable breeding weather caused by a large number of cyclones in East Africa. India, China, and Pakistan face the most risk in Asia, according to the UN. Locust attacks are known to cause a considerable drop in agricultural output. In its update on Thursday, the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), said locusts’ breeding was continuing in southern Iran and south-west Pakistan, where control operations are in progress against hopper groups and bands. “As vegetation dries out, more groups and swarms will form and move from these areas to the summer breeding areas along both sides of the Indo-Pakistan border in several waves from now until at least early July. Good rains are predicted during the first half of June along the Indo-Pakistan border [and] that would allow egg-laying to occur. This should reduce the further eastward movement of swarms that have already arrived in Rajasthan, India.”K L Gurjar, deputy director, plant protection, Locust Warning Organisation, Union agriculture ministry, said the locusts that have arrived are sub-adults flying very high and covering huge distances fast. “They have reached up to Morena and Gwalior in Madhya Pradesh with the help of westerly winds. Swarms were also seen in Haryana bordering areas like Jhunjhunu. These have come from Pakistan, Baluchistan and Iran, which are their breeding area. Because they are sub-adults, there is a risk of egg-laying which we are trying to contain. Our teams are spraying insecticides and tracking their movement.” Madhya Pradesh principal secretary, department of farmer welfare and agriculture, Ajit Kesari said, “The government of India has released Rs 51 lakh for purchase of chemical. We are keeping stock of chemicals in all the districts. Our instructions to all these districts are to track the locusts and spray chemical wherever they settle at night. Thus, their number is decreasing by the day. Also, wherever they settle the area is chemically treated to destroy eggs also. Meanwhile, government of India has warned Maharashtra given the possibility of the swarms heading in that direction.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-sounds-alarm-as-locusts-enter-raj-mp/story-E0zCNMqgLmU2Nlrtn5GX4H.html

This is the first step towards his release,” his brother Muzzammil tweeted.The granting of bail, however, doesn’t mean he will be out from jail immediately. There are several cases against Sharjeel lodged in different states of the country.According to reports, the statutory bail was granted by court as the police failed to file charge sheet against Sharjeel within the stipulated 90 days and also didn’t seek extension of his custody.Following his arrest, Sharjeel was brought to Guwahati on February 20 by Assam Police.Assam Police had registered a case against Imam after a video of him stating that Assam should be cut-off from the rest of India, during the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protest, went viral.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gauhati-high-court-grants-statutory-bail-to-sharjeel/story-AWF6nDI95DkX2eAD9OPW4K.html
23-05-2020||India||Parts of Delhi sizzle at 45°C, no quick respite likely: IMD||Several Indian cities faced heat wave conditions with maximum temperature hovering over 45 degree Celsius on Friday and no respite is expected in the next few days.Heat wave conditions gripped Palam and Lodhi Road in Delhi with the two weather stations recording maximum temperatures of 45.4 degrees C and 44.4 degrees C respectively, five degrees above normal. The Safdarjung weather station also recorded the highest maximum temperature for the season at 43.8 degrees C, four degrees above normal.“We cannot expect any relief from hot weather in northwest India till May 27. The maximum temperature will range from 42 to 45 degrees C. Around May 29, a western disturbance is likely to cause clouding. The dry hot north-westerly winds and clear skies are leading to maximum temperatures peaking,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, Delhi. The India Meteorological Department (IMD), in its Friday bulletin, said on Thursday the highest maximum temperature was recorded at 46 degrees C in coastal Andhra Pradesh and Yanam while the highest maximum temperature on Friday was recorded at Churu in west Rajasthan at 46.2 degrees C. Heat wave conditions are very likely over Rajasthan and West Madhya Pradesh during the next five days with severe heat waves in some pockets over West Rajasthan during the next 24 hours. Heat wave conditions are likely over parts of peninsular India and Vidarbha during next three or four days; over East Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh after 24 hours and over southern parts of Uttar Pradesh after 48 hours. The worst health impacts of the heat wave will be borne by migrant workers who are headed home on foot or by other transport, experts said.According to National Disaster Management Authority, around 2.3 million migrant workers have travelled by train between May 12 and May 21, the data for those walking back or travelling in buses cannot be estimated said, Pawan Kumar Singh, joint advisor, national disaster management authority (NDMA). Many workers are also walking back to their villages from train stations.“They are very vulnerable to heat strokes if they are walking. They will have to drink a lot of water and take rest frequently. They should choose cooler parts of the day to walk like mornings and evenings. It is best to quarantine them when they reach their villages and migrants should wear masks and wash their hands frequently to prevent infection. Even in Gujarat, we initially saw migrants walking back to nearby villages from Ahmedabad but now they are walking very large distances,” said Dilip Mavlankar, Gandhinagar’s Indian Institute of Public Health director.Priya Deshingkar, Professor of Migration and Development, University of Sussex, on Friday in a conference organised by Centre for Science and Environment on the current migration crisis, said: “The current exodus of migrants is the largest we have seen since Partition. Hundreds of thousands have decided to travel back on foot, tempos, trucks and whatever transport they can find, in terrible conditions. While they were initially prevented from travelling because of fears related to the spread of Covid-19, they are now being asked to stay back because of fears of the impact on the economy that depends on cheap migrant labour.”The India Meteorological Department (IMD), Nagpur division declared heat wave conditions for Nagpur, Akola and Chandrapur, all recorded maximum temperatures over 45 degrees Celsius in Vidarbha subdivision on Friday. “When the actual maximum temperature remains 45 degrees Celsius or more irrespective of normal maximum temperature, we declare heatwave,” said ML Sahu, deputy director-general of meteorology, IMD Nagpur.In Uttar Pradesh, the Met department has issued for warning of heatwave conditions in the next 48 hours. Heatwave condition is very likely at isolated places over the state, the weather office said. The day temperature remained above normal in many cities of the state. At 46.1 degree Celsius, Jhansi was hottest in the state. It was 3.1 degrees Celsius above normal. Taj city Agra was 45.4 degrees Celsius, Prayagraj 45, Kanpur was 44.5 degrees Celsius, Aligarh and Banda was 44 degrees Celsius.The neighbouring Madhya Pradesh recorded maximum 46 degree Celsius temperature at Nowgong in Chhatarpur district. As per the meteorological department, as many as 28 towns in the state record maximum temperature between 41 and 46 degree Celsius. The department forecast that heat wave may be witnessed in parts of Khargone, Khandwa and Burhanpur in Nimad region in the next 24 hours.The maximum temperature of Patna and Gaya, two prominent cities of Bihar, continued to hover around 42⁰C before it was brought down to 33-35⁰C owing to a few spells of showers a couple of days ago.The two Telugu states of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh started witnessing extreme heatwave conditions from Thursday. According to IMD officials in Hyderabad, the maximum temperature of 45.6 degrees Celsius was recorded in Khammam as on Friday morning. Adilabad, Nalgonda and Ramagundam recorded 44 degrees Celsius, followed by Nizamabad (43.9), Bhadrachalam (43.8), Mahabubnagar and Medak (43.6). Hyderabad recorded the hottest day of the year so far with 42 degrees Celsius.Even, prominent hill stations including Shimla, Manali, Dharamshala and Dalhousie of Himachal saw warmer than usual days as temperatures increased by two degrees on Friday. Himachal’s director, Meteorological Department Dr Manmohan Singh said the maximum temperatures are very likely to increase in the coming days and are very likely going to be more than 40 degrees in lower hills of the state.With 39.7 degrees maximum temperature, Una was the hottest place in the state and Shimla recorded 27.1 degrees maximum temperature while Manali, Dharamshala and Dalhousie recorded 28.4, 29.2 and 22.4 degrees maximum temperature. Kufri, near Shimla recorded 20.2 degrees maximum temperature. In Punjab, Bathinda recorded the highest of 43.6 degree Celsius followed by Amritsar 41.6 and Ludhiana 40.8.

23-05-2020||India||Unusually warm Bay of Bengal allowed cyclone Amphan to gain strength||Before the formation of cyclone Amphan, the sea surface temperature in some pockets of the Bay of Bengal in the first two weeks of May was recorded to be as high as 34 degrees C, possibly for the first time ever, scientists from the Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS), Hyderabad, said.Even after Amphan passed and its intensity has fizzled out, the temperature in parts of the Bay of Bengal remain as high as 31.5 degrees C, which is above the normal of 28 degrees C for May, and may favour the monsoon, which is near Car Nicobar now. “I have seen sea surface temperature going up to 32 degrees C earlier but not 34 degrees C. It’s very, very warm and favoured the cyclone in all ways,” said Satheesh Shenoi, director, INCOIS. The devastation from Amphan may be massive, inundating large stretches of low lying areas, but INCOIS is not able to give figures and data of storm surge or inundation this time because the outbreak of Covid-19 has prevented it from sending a team to the cyclone-affected areas“Based on details from the ground, we can say that storm surge must have been between 4 to 6 metres in North and South 24 Parganas. We are in a peculiar situation. Usually, immediately after a cyclone, our team rushes to the coast to measure storm surge with our instruments. For inundation, field studies are done to check the mark of water on trees, buildings etc. We can only estimate now that low lying areas of Sunderbans must have been inundated substantially at least for some time because there are narrow bunds and storm surge must have been very high,” added Shenoi.“This time, Bay of Bengal has been unusually warm. The cyclone was moving only on warm waters which gave it this scale of energy,” Shenoi said.“Most modelling studies are indicating that category 4 and 5 cyclones are increasing globally while category 1,2 and 3 cyclones are declining. This is something we have to live with as the oceans warm up,” said V Vinoj, climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bhubaneshwar.A study led by School of Earth Sciences, University of Melbourne, last year said that based on projections, tropical cyclone numbers will decrease while their maximum intensities will increase and future sea level rise will exacerbate the impact of storm surge on coastal regions.“In the past two to three years, we are noticing a rise in tropical cyclones over the Arabian Sea. There are various research papers that are saying that intensity of tropical cyclones has increased but some studies have also contradicted those findings. So I will not be able to comment on that,” said Sunita Devi, in charge of cyclones at IMD.Last year there were seven severe cyclones (over the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal), the first time as high a number was being recorded since 1976, according to data from the India Meteorological Department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unusually-warm-bay-of-bengal-allowed-cyclone-to-gain-strength/story-c6MQvXZAvp62LTeZIeiRIK.html
23-05-2020||India||PM announces Rs 1,500 crore relief for Amphan-hit Bengal, Odisha||Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced Rs 1,500 crore for the relief and rehabilitation of people affected by Cyclone Amphan in West Bengal and Odisha, and assured the states of more support after conducting separate aerial surveys with chief ministers Mamata Banerjee and Naveen Patnaik on Friday.West Bengal is fighting well, the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) quoted Modi as saying in a series of tweets, which also underscored the fact that the state is faced with the two-pronged challenge of fighting the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and rebuilding areas battered by the cyclone. Modi’s remarks were seen as praise for Banerjee, one of his staunchest critics.“The government of India will work shoulder-to-shoulder with the state administration. We are announcing the release of an advance assistance fund of Rs 1,000 crore,” Modi said in Hindi after a review meeting in Basirhat in North 24 Parganas. Later, he announced immediate assistance of Rs 500 crore for Odisha.Cyclone Amphan, the most severe storm in the Bay of Bengal since the super cyclone of 1999, has left a trail of destruction and damage in the two states. It made landfall around 20km east of Sagar Island in the Sunderbans on Wednesday afternoon, packing winds gusting to a top speed of 185 kilometres per hour, cutting off road links, snapping telecommunications, leaving parts of West Bengal without electricity, and inundating coastal hamlets. It killed about 80 people in West Bengal and at least two in Odisha.It was around 11am that Modi reached the Kolkata airport, where he was received by Banerjee and governor Jagdeep Dhankar on the first leg of his day-long tour. Differences took a back seat when Modi and Banerjee, fierce opponents on two sides of the political spectrum, boarded a helicopter to survey the worst-hit areas of North and South 24 Parganas districts. Accompanying them was Dhankar, whose endorsement of central policies has time and again put him in the crosshairs of the ruling Trinamool Congress.“At times we have to move beyond politics, attend to constitutional obligations and work together as state and central governments. We have to maintain that relationship. We have to follow the federal structure,” Banerjee said before the arrival of Modi.“While we have received reports of 80 deaths; 60 million people in the state have been directly affected. This (cyclone) has done more damage than any other natural disaster,” she said.At the review meeting with Banerjee in Basirhat after the survey, Modi declared that Rs 2 lakh each will be given to families of the deceased from the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund. Those injured will get Rs 50,000 each.“We all want West Bengal to move ahead. Centre will always stand with West Bengal in these testing times,” the PMO quoted Modi as saying. “We are battling a pandemic on one hand and there is a cyclone situation in some parts. Dealing with the pandemic requires social distancing whereas battling the cyclone requires people to move to safer areas,” the PMO said in another tweet. “Despite these contradictions, West Bengal is fighting well…”Banerjee said her state suffered losses of more than Rs 1 lakh crore due to the storm that has left tens of thousands homeless. “Most of the areas we surveyed were totally ravaged. I have briefed the Prime Minister in detail about the post-cyclone situation in the state,” she told reporters at the airport after seeing off Modi.Banerjee said she “reminded the Prime Minister about Rs 53,000 crore the central government owes to the state for various social security schemes”. “If they (Centre) give some money to us, we can work,” she said.Dhankar, who donated Rs 50 lakh to the chief minister’s relief fund, welcomed the “atmosphere of cooperation”. “I see light at the end of the tunnel. I am sure that when the central team comes for inspection (of the post-cyclone situation) it will be received with a red carpet,” he said in the evening.In Odisha too, Modi conducted an aerial survey after holding a review meeting with governor Ganeshi Lal and CM Patnaik, and announced the Rs 500-crore package for the state. In addition to that, Modi said, further assistance will be provided for long-term rehabilitation measures after the Centre receives a detailed report. “Everyone is fighting Covid-19. In such a time, we had a super cyclone in some parts of India. This became very worrying. At the same time, due to the well-established processes in Odisha, many lives were saved. I congratulate the people and Government of Odisha,” the PMO tweeted Modi as saying.According to the preliminary estimates by Odisha, the storm affected 4.4 million people and over 100,000 hectares of farmland in the state. Separately, president Ram Nath Kovind spoke to Banerjee and Patnaik, and assured them that the nation stands united in supporting their affected people.On Friday, the air force said it modified aircraft/helicopters for relief operations and is on standby. It said its crisis management cell is coordinating with the civil administration and National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) teams on the ground.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-announces-1-5k-cr-relief-for-amphan-hit-bengal-odisha/story-EuE2KIsOg73azcLW4bluZM.html
23-05-2020||India||For Bengal’s migrant workers back from other states, Cyclone Amphan is a nightmare||A week ago, more than 100 migrant workers had returned to Haroa, in Basirhat sub-division of North 24-Parganas district, from the states of Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Maharashtra. 32-year-old Jasimuddin Islam, a resident of Biswanathpur who has a family of four, found his place at a quarantine centre after coming back from Tamil Nadu, walking and hitchhiking. His yearning to reach home became unbearable on Thursday after hearing that Cyclone Amphan had left their tiled-roofed, brick-built house completely grounded.“I broke into tears on hearing the news. Everything is over. The job is gone. Whatever I had earned has been spent during our stay in Tamil Nadu and the return journey. And now the roof above the family’s head is also gone,” said Islam. At Karanjali area in South 24-Parganas, dozens of migrant workers returned from Maharashtra on Friday morning, only to know that their home and their ponds had been devastated.“I returned virtually penniless and now even my home is gone,” said Maheshwar Biswas, a migrant worker in Karanjali area who took work as a mason in Maharashtra.At Sagar and Gosaba area in South 24-Parganas, and Sandeshkhali and Hingalganj in North 24-Pasrganas a number of cyclone centres had been turned into quarantine centres for suspected Covid-19 carriers, especially migrant workers who recently returned from other states. More than 5,000 migrant workers had returned to the Kakdwip and Canning sub-divisions of South 24-Parganas district.“I couldn’t stand the scene when migrant workers who are presently at quarantine centres broke into tears after hearing that their houses had been grounded by the cyclone. We have no words to console them,” said Sandeshkhali MLA Sukumar Mahato.Some of the migrant workers, like Osman Mallick and Biswanath Talukdar of Minakhan in North 24-Parganas, who had been allowed to go home after completing the period of institutional quarantine, had to leave home again, this time for cyclone centres in schools. The storm has left their homes uninhabitable.“We have no job, no money, no savings and no home. Where do we go?” said Bidyut Sardar, a resident of Sarabaria village in Minakhan who returned from Karnataka about two weeks ago.Jaynagar’s Lok Sabha MP Pratima Mandal said that the crisis faced by migrant workers living in cyclone-hit areas was “of great magnitude”.“The more news of such losses are coming in, the more helpless we are feeling. There are hundreds of them who have lost everything and we don’t yet know how much relief we can offer them,” Mandal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/for-bengal-s-migrant-workers-back-from-other-states-cyclone-amphan-is-a-nightmare/story-vc5ch6kvcl9C6tBghSmvlI.html
23-05-2020||India||Woman tries to stop husband’s bus, falls, dies. Unaware, he drives away||A 30-year-old woman died in mysterious circumstances after she tried to stop her husband’s Mumbai-bound bus, in which he had brought migrant workers home in Hazaribagh, police said on Friday.Kunti Devi did not want her husband Basudev Mahto to go back to Mumbai, fearing the rise in coronavirus cases there, and tried to stop the bus. While the husband was revving up the bus engine to leave, she accidently fell on the ground and died, police said.The incident took place at Sarukudar village in Hazaribag’s Vishnugarh block around 5pm yesterday. However, police were informed about the incident around 10pm at night.Mahto, who works as a bus driver in Mumbai, brought 25 Jharkhand migrant workers to Hazaribagh. After dropping the passengers at a quarantine centre, he went to meet his parents, wife and the two children at Sarukudar village.Pramod Kumar Sinha, Bishnugarh police station in-charge, said that during questioning of few witnesses and villagers on Thursday night they came to know that the wife was not ready to let her husband return to Mumbai and had become adamant.Mahto reportedly did not stop after the incident. “Since we got the information late and did not have the number of the bus, we could not stop it. He could not be reached on his mobile,” Sinha said. The officer added that they are investigating to find out the location of Mahto in Mumbai.“My wife was not ready to let me go back to Mumbai. I told her that I would come back in a week after bringing another lot of migrant workers from there. But she was not ready to listen. She said either I allow her to come along or give my mobile to her,” Mahto told police.“The argument continued and I took over the driver’s seat. As I got ready to leave, she got inside the bus. Anyhow, I got her down from the bus. I thought she went back home. But, she came in front of my bus. I could not hear her. As the vehicle began moving, she fell on the ground. I never thought that she would die,” Mahto told police.A section of the villagers, however, alleged that Mahto crushed her wife to death. “We did not find any sign that the woman was crushed. There was head injury and prima facie it seemed a case of accident,” he said.Hundreds of migrant labourers are returning to Jharkhand everyday by trains and buses. As per the government records, 1.5 lakh migrant workers and students stranded outside the state have returned to Jharkhand since interstate movement of trains and buses was allowed by the Centre on April 29. Around seven lakh migrant workers have registered with the state government to return home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/woman-tries-to-stop-husband-s-bus-falls-dies-unaware-he-drives-away/story-HQ18PuXXzRjuhYSnbrE90O.html
23-05-2020||India||Second case involving Parliament staff, senior officer found Covid-19 positive||A senior officer of Parliament working in the editorial and translation (E&T) services tested coronavirus disease (Covid-19) positive recently.The officer had attended office till May 12, which is located on the fifth floor of the Parliament annex building that houses most of the parliamentary officials and chambers for House panel meetings.This is the second Covid-19 positive case involving a Parliament staff after a senior housekeeper had contracted SARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease, in April, making it the first case among the 3,000-odd staff working in the Lok Sabha secretariat.But unlike the senior housekeeper, the E&T official had attended his office regularly before he was put under quarantine, people familiar with the matter said.The annex building is located about 100 metres away from the main Parliament building and is connected with a dedicated road, which was earlier a part of the Talkatora Road.The E&T’s staff’s infection, according to an official, came to light only on Thursday and since Friday morning, all necessary arrangements for sealing a block of offices on the fifth floor of the annex and a santisation drive of the building have been carried out. Contact tracing has also started in earnest.Parliament opened with one-third staff after the lockdown 2.0 expired on May 3.The housekeeping staff, who tested Covid-19 positive in April, was not working in the Parliament complex but in one of the establishments of the Lok Sabha secretariat at 36 Gurudwara Rakab Gunj Road.The special Housekeeper, according to three officials, was at home since the budget session of Parliament was adjourned on March 23.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/second-case-involving-parliament-staff-senior-officer-found-covid-19-positive/story-6JKHrlVzaCO2ggPhAh6nVO.html
23-05-2020||India||Covid-19 cases in India exceed 100,000, but low fatality ratio offers hope||The number of known coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in India crossed 100,000 on Monday, two-and-a-half months after the outbreak began taking hold in the country, which then went into an unprecedented lockdown that slowed the outbreak to a significant extent. The milestone was a grim reminder of the challenge India, which has the second highest population in the world, faces as it rolls back some of the curbs in place since March 25 to allow economic activity to resume. Click here for full Covid-19 coverageIn the 78 days since the outbreak began, total infections were at 100,311 and 3,081 people succumbed to the disease till Monday, but the trend indicates the situation may be less serious than the global scenario, where the proportion of deaths is double what has been seen in the country on an average. “We have successfully managed to delay the peaking of the curve by imposing lockdown and other public health measures in a timely manner. There are several mathematical models which are predicting the course of the pandemic in India, but till now, we have managed to avoid the dramatically high numbers that several models predicted,” said.Union Health minister Harsh Vardhan. “It is difficult to predict numbers as they will depend on the adherence of restrictions on mobility and inter-mingling, personal hygiene, and prevention of exposure to infection by people in different areas. Additionally, it will also depend on the proportion of those infected among migrants and travellers from outside and within.” he added.In the national capital, 299 new cases pushed Delhi’s tally above the 10,000 mark. As on Monday, Delhi has 10,054 cases and 160 deaths, putting the mortality rate close to 1.6%, which is roughly half of the national average of 3.09%. Delhi has one of the highest testing rates in the country, with 6,919 tests per million population. The national testing rate for India is 1,540 tests per million population, according to Indian Council of Medical Research.Based on data reported till Monday evening, India’s case fatality rate stood at 3.07%. Across the world, where 4.8 million infections have led to at least 317,000 deaths, the fatality rate is at 6.57%. In United States, the country now hardest hit, the fatality stood at 6%. For China, where the virus first began spreading, the figure is 5.56%, “The Covid-19 outbreak in India could have been far worse. If you look at the number of deaths we have averted, India has done remarkably well. This is mainly because of early measures like the nationwide lockdown,” said Dr Giridhar R Babu, professor and head of life course epidemiology, Public Health Foundation of India.As India relaxes some more of the curbs that were put in place on March 25, experts said the coming weeks will be crucial to determine whether the country can hold onto these gains. “Lockdown helped reduce the rate of transmission, but what we do now will be of utmost importance. The focus should be on problem states like West Bengal, Gujarat, Delhi, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra, particularly Mumbai,” Babu added.A weekly tracker of Covid-19 infection trends by disease modeling experts at Imperial College London indicated that the rate of transmission of the disease in India came down to below 1 (the authors identified it as 0.98), a threshold that is key to stop the virus from growing exponentially. On May 11, the model predicted there would be 801 deaths in India for the week ending on Sunday. Reported deaths for the week, based on HT’s dashboard of cases, stood at 812. In the week till Sunday, the speed at which the outbreak grew would take India 13.7 days to double its number of cases. But that could change for the worse as the country allows more offices to reopen and public transport to resume. New infections among the hundreds of thousands of migrants returning to their villages and hometowns from urban centres is also feared to seed cases in rural parts of the country that had till now been largely free of infections.A second expert said that India’s aggressive measures need to continue. “Careful risk assessments should identify hotspots and clusters, and continued efforts should be made to further strengthen capacities to respond, especially at sub-national levels. The core public health measures for Covid-19 response remain, rapidly detect, test, isolate, treat and trace all contacts,” said Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, regional director, World Health Organisation South East Asia Region, of which India is a part.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cases-exceed-100-000-but-low-fatality-ratio-offers-hope/story-WKtH4uhMTXZNfqp3sKxvZP.html
23-05-2020||India||Private vehicle use may surge after crisis||In the next couple of months, as cities start to reopen, the most perceptible change may be in how their people commute. Researchers have established a significant link between the spread of infectious diseases and travelling in buses or metro trains, where people routinely share enclosed spaces with many others.The risk of an outbreak linked to mass transit grows when people spend more time in a bus or a train, and use or pass through stations that typically see a heavy rush of passengers, according to a 2018 study published in the journal Environmental Health.“The transmission of infectious diseases is dependent on the amount and nature of contacts between infectious and healthy individuals. Confined and crowded environments that people visit in their day-to-day life (such as town squares, business districts, transport hubs, etc) can act as hot spots for spreading disease,” said the authors Lara Gosce and Anders Johanson in the study that found people who took the London Underground from boroughs with high-footfall stations were more susceptible to flu-like illnesses.The study formed the basis of a recent paper by MIT professor Jeffrey E Harris, who found a similar correlation between Covid-19 infections and the use of the New York subway system. “New York City’s multitentacled subway system was a major disseminator – if not the principal transmission vehicle – of coronavirus infection during the initial takeoff of the massive epidemic,” Harris wrote in a paper for the National Bureau of Economic Research of the US.Such findings and concerns are now forcing transit authorities to reconsider how – and if -- India can restart public transport in a way that crowding is reduced.“Considering social distancing of a minimum of 1 metre per passengers would mean increasing Delhi Metro services by almost seven times and bus services by five times,” said Amit Bhatt, director of urban transport at independent research organisation WRI India. “But this is not possible. There is a need to take on-board safety measures to protect commuters and on-board staff. This could include sanitizing all locations used for public transport service and to protect staff from exposure to ensure the continued functioning of services,” he added.Officials of the Union government have said that they are considering doing away with single-use tokens in order to reduce touch points between people, while the Central Industrial Security Force – which oversees security on the network – is looking at contactless frisking and making the government’s digital contact tracing app Aarogya Setu mandatory for commuters. But most of these proposals are still in preliminary stages, as reopening public transport remains one of the more distant outcomes as cities slowly begin to reopen. “We are exploring all possible options to minimise the transmission of the infection among commuters. But no concrete decision has been taken as yet. Moreover, public transport service will be restored based on the relaxation in lockdown norms,” said a senior Delhi government official on the options before the Delhi Transport Corporation, which runs the Capital’s buses.Most experts believe that for the time being, and possibly over the next few years, people may pivot to using personal vehicles. “Once the lockdown is over, people would like to travel in their personal vehicles as it is the safest mode of transportation to protect oneself from the Sars-CoV-2 infection,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of community medicine at Safdarjung HospitalAccording to a survey conducted by the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy in early March in China’s Guangzhou, a little over a third of the metro and bus commuters were using public transit systems but after the outbreak, 40% had shifted to cars, taxis and ride-hailing, and the rest to walking and biking. In France, where authorities plan to lift the nationwide lockdown in phases from May 11, the authorities are urging people to use bicycles to commute. “We want this period to take a step forward in cycling culture, and that the bicycle is the little queen of deconfinement in a way,” the minister for ecological transition Élisabeth Borne said, according to Bloomberg.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/private-vehicle-use-may-surge-after-crisis/story-UBLtje27Tii8UOZSb9V6gN.html
23-05-2020||India||Social distancing here to stay, small groups may be key||Four months into the worst pandemic in a generation that has shut down nations and forced half of humanity indoors, there is no definitive end in sight. A vaccine for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) is at least a year – if not two or more -- away. The most successful of therapies identified till now have limited benefits at best. Achieving herd immunity could possibly lead to millions of deaths worldwide – 246,827 had already succumbed till Sunday – and hence not realistically possible. Combine this with the seemingly unstoppable nature of the Sars-Cov-2 infection that has ripped its way through the globe and there is only one feasible option: Large-scale social distancing that requires a fundamental rethink of the ways in which we socialise, work and function in society. Scientists and medical experts unanimously agree that social distancing -- the practice of ensuring a minimum distance of 6 feet between two people to ensure that one person cannot contract the infection from another -- helped save tens of thousands of lives in China and elsewhere. Social distancing strategies are the core of national policies in China, South Korea, Australia and Hong Kong that lifted some curbs in the last fortnight. Some European countries such as France, Italy and Spain plan to allow more people to move around later this month. While masks, temperature checks and hand sanitizers have become ubiquitous, experts and authorities are now looking at social distancing strategies that are more focused and less disruptive than sweeping shutdowns that cripple national economies, batter incomes and can drive millions into poverty. But such large-scale strategies require a re-imagination of the ways people interact, workplace practices, shift timings and classroom compositions.According to demography and sociology researchers from three European universities, one of the most crucial principles behind these measures would be to split up people into smaller, insulated clusters of population. The suggestion is based on evidence of how people behave in social networks: Most people interact largely with the same set of people over the day, with some contact with individuals from another cluster. If contact between such clusters of people are minimised, an infected person is likely to expose a smaller number of people to the coronavirus than usual. “Our models demonstrate that while social distancing measures clearly do flatten the curve, strategic reduction of contact can strongly increase their efficiency, introducing the possibility of allowing some social contact while keeping risks low,” say the researchers in a study shared on arXiv, a moderated online archive of papers that have not been fully peer reviewed. “We can make judgements on which of our contacts are long-range ties that should be avoided or, if necessary for work, should be treated with utmost care: People that live far away, people that don’t know any of our other contacts, or people that we have not seen in a longer time – these are contacts that carry the biggest risk,” said Per Block, the lead author of the study and a researcher at University of Oxford’s Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science And Department Of Sociology.The strategy, Block adds, can be adapted to most interactions people have in everyday life, whether it is for schoolchildren, essential workers, office-goers or people merely meeting their friends. “For essential workers it means keeping composition of work shifts constant over long periods of time and distributing people on shifts based on proximity and similarity. “For workplaces, it means staggered start, break and end times by different departments or units – keep contact in small groups, and reducing contact between them. “For schools, this would mean closed classroom composition, varied break times, distribution of children to similar groups…,” Block added, citing co-author Melinda Mills.Such a strategy, however, may be challenging in a country like India where household sizes are larger and many people often cram into a single room. “On a principle level, I think it is fair to say that larger households require more discipline and coordination among household members, since the contact partners of each individual household member are often not in contact,” said Block, adding that the insights in their paper can serve as a basis for policy recommendations by people on the ground who are more aware of population-specific context.Some workplaces have begun reorganising their offices on the basis of such principles. “Instead of having one large office, what we’ve done, even prior to Covid, was to have smaller offices in different cities… and we were connected through cloud and digital technologies. Now the next step post-Covid is that even within a single city, we are planning to open offices in different places which can access talent that lives closer,” said Manit Rastogi, founder of Morphogenesis, an architecture firm. Rastogi’s company has offices spread out across three cities, and more locations will follow a ‘hub and spoke model’ post-lockdown. “The idea is that these are smaller offices: to use a random number, 4-5 different offices, with 20 people each, living locally. So no one will have to travel more than a 5-7km radius. These are the spokes. The hub in turn, is the repository of the information being fed realtime from the spokes,” he added.Letting people interact in some manner is also crucial from a mental health perspective. Prolonged social distancing is likely to lead to “mental health outcomes; especially for those who do not have a robust support system in place and are struggling through this process alone,” said Dr Samir Parikh, director, department of mental health and behavioural sciences, Fortis Healthcare.

23-05-2020||India||Test health workers, hospital staff once a week to reduce transmission risk: Study||Health workers deployed in high-risk environs such as hospitals should be tested for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) once a week, according to a new study by researchers in the United Kingdom who say that doing so could reduce the risk of them spreading the infection further by 25%.On Sunday, at least 29 health workers – including 12 doctors and 11 nurses -- tested positive for Covid-19 at a single hospital in New Delhi. The findings are part of a study on what testing strategies countries can adopt to reduce the spread of Covid-19. The researchers, from Imperial College of London which is one of the centres collaborating with the World Health Organization for infectious diseases modeling, identified health care workers (HCWs) – doctors, nurses and hospital staff – as people who need to be tested at regular intervals.“We find that testing is most useful when targeted at high-risk groups such as health care and care home staff, where regular screening in addition to testing of symptomatic individuals may prevent an additional 25-33% of their contribution to transmission in hospital and the community,” said the study’s lead author, Nicholas Grassly, in an email to HT.Grassly added that while widespread testing to detect the virus as well as the antibodies will help understand the scale of the pandemic and play a crucial role in how lockdown measures are lifted or rolled out, it is unlikely to reduce the spread of infections in itself. For that, testing will need to be focused. “This study shows that regular testing of health care workers, for example once a week, could reduce their contribution to transmission by 25%, provided that test results are delivered quickly (less than 24 hours after the swab is taken). This is in addition to the reduction in transmission seen when healthcare workers self-isolate after developing symptoms,” said Marga Pons Salort, who also authored the study. “If tests were to be done at the end of a shift and results made available before the next shift, then the time delay between testing and isolation would effectively be zero, increasing effectiveness to 25-33%,” the study also said.The researchers note that the need to continuously screen healthcare workers stems from the nature of the disease: approximately 20-50% of infected people are without symptoms while they may be just as infectious, and nearly 40% of infections occur before symptoms set in. In India, according to the Union health ministry’s testing protocols, only symptomatic health care workers will be eligible for a Covid-19 test. The protocols, however, allow individuals who have been in direct contact or are taking care of a confirmed Covid-19 patient to be tested between 5-14 days after the first time they were exposed to the infected person.According to a study in China’s Wuhan, where the coronavirus causing Covid-19 first infected a human, close to 30% of health care staff were infected at one of the city’s main hospitals. They then spread the infection to family members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/test-health-workers-hospital-staff-once-a-week-to-reduce-transmission-risk-study/story-iqHE8RCuDMXzRJ0l7GhkDJ.html
23-05-2020||Today's||A strategy to come out of lockdown 4.0||As India slowly opens up in lockdown 4.0, our cities — home to some of the highest densities in the world and with limited public health infrastructure — must prepare to battle an expected spike of Covid-19 cases. As on May 20, 2020, almost 65% of all confirmed cases were concentrated in just 10 cities. The worst five affected — Mumbai, Delhi, Ahmedabad, Chennai and Pune — account for over 50% of the country’s cases. Now that India has crossed 100,000 cases, substantial data is available to analyse and project future trends to prepare nuanced urban strategies. In the above-mentioned five cities, publicly available data shows us that approximately 56,000 cases are spread across around 1,600 containment zones. We can thus determine the interrelationship between the spread of the virus and specific urban contexts: identifying the types of areas where the impact of the virus has been greatest can help us pre-empt future spread by ensuring monitoring, screening and containment of similar areas elsewhere. This paradigm shift in approach can help cities get ahead of the curve, and municipalities to effectively use their resources in a targeted manner for maximum benefit.Cities have adopted varying parameters for demarcating containment zones, ranging from an individual plot, a small residential cluster to an entire ward. However, it is important to look at the coronavirus spread through a common granular lens. Urban India typically has seven types of residential areas (RA) based on parameters such as population density, dwelling and household size, building type (apartment, individual house, tenements etc.), street widths, levels of amenity etc. These are categorized as types, with type 1 being slums or temporary hutments; type 2 being unplanned colonies, rehabilitation colonies, urban villages, small-sized plotted housing (< 125 sqm), old city and other traditional cores; type 3 being government housing/low-rise group housing; type 4 being cooperative group housing schemes, integrated townships; type 5 being medium-sized plotted housing (125– 300 sqm); type 6 being large-sized plotted housing (> 300 sqm); and type 7 being villages on the city periphery. As data is tagged to the residence of the Covid-19 case, it would benefit cities to include the residential area type of these cases in their analytics.Once economic activity resumes, typology of non-residential areas (NRA) such as small and medium scale industries, commercial uses, retail, etc. that begin to demonstrate greater incidences of cases, should also be analysed.Our analysis of the location of the almost 1,600 containment zones in Mumbai, Delhi, Ahmedabad, Chennai and Pune reveals that over 65% lie within RA type 2 (RA 02), i.e. areas such as unplanned colonies, chawls, and housing on plots less than 125 sqm. As one would expect, these areas are characterised by high densities. However, it is essential to acknowledge that the quality of the built environment and the resultant poor living conditions is significant: three to five storey high building typologies with small habitable spaces for large families, narrow lanes that double as the primary open space and shared bathing and toilet facilities lead to heightened physical contact and make RA 02 unsuitable for home isolation and home quarantine. Furthermore, enforcing restrictions on movement in these areas is difficult due to multiple entry and exit points. Almost 20% of the containment zones fall in RA 05 (medium sized-plotted housing), while 10 % fall in RA 03 (low-rise group housing) in these cities. Slums or temporary hutments, villages on the periphery and larger scale plotted housing are less than 5% of the containment zones.Since comprehensive data on addresses of positive Covid-19 cases is not available publicly, we were unable to correlate the intensity of spread with the residential area type. However, with the information available, a definite pattern emerged: zones of the city, usually unplanned, with extremely high densities, are significantly more vulnerable. These areas accommodate a substantial percentage of a city’s overall population and are home to a majority of its lower income workforce. Can pre-emptive monitoring and containment measures and social benefit schemes be rolled out in all such areas, even those unaffected by the virus? Could health booths manned primarily by volunteers under the supervision of a small medical team be set up locally to conduct biweekly door-to-door visits and provide much needed health updates? Infrastructure such as this would help in early detection, timely isolation and quarantine, and prevent these areas from transitioning into higher levels of transmission. Similarly, targeted schemes for social and financial assistance including supply of essential provisions and minimum monthly sustenance allowances could be guaranteed for such areas, especially if they lie in a containment zone. These areas should also be prioritised when pre-emptive testing for asymptomatic cases is undertaken.It is crucial that economic growth drivers such as these cities no longer merely respond to the pandemic. Data analytics, linking positive cases to specific RA and NRA types will enable municipalities to identify priority areas, roll out pre-emptive monitoring and containment measures, allocate limited resources in a targeted way and adopt a quick-footed response to the Covid-19 pandemic. At the same time, cities must start the process of aligning development priorities and budgetary allocations towards the rehabilitation of these unplanned areas to enhance living conditions of city residents.Mriganka Saxena and Puneet Khanna, architects and urban designers and founding partners of Delhi-based practice, Habitat Tectonics Architecture and Urbanism||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/a-strategy-to-come-out-of-lockdown-4-0/story-XsRh7JtTQQcLlGxKAX4hpM.html
23-05-2020||Today's||Return migration is inevitable, but equations have changed||For some Indians, a life well lived was abruptly upended by the Covid-19 pandemic and then the series of government-mandated lockdowns. Things may never be the same again. Prior to World War 2, affluent families in England had domestic helps mainly from Wales and Ireland because the Scots were too much canny. This changed soon after the war ended as better opportunities appeared in the economy elsewhere, principally in manufacturing. The current pandemic is as yet far from the scale of destruction of WW2 but it is a significant global event that is likely to deliver accelerated social change.The mass migration that has taken place is distressing to the point of being gut-wrenching, the images and ordeals are unbearable, even super-human, yet in spite of what appears to be insurmountable odds, the desperate and hungry have proceeded home stoically and largely peacefully.This in itself is not surprising. After all hunger has historically inspired wars, anarchy and revolution in almost equal measure.LONG MARCH HOMEWhat has been surprising is that many migrants still in work, still with some savings, still in housing, almost simultaneously reached the same conclusion to reach home, however far it may be, without any political prompt or activist sermon.Where hunger was not a factor, it was the fear of death from Covid-19 or from the host communities that ensured that the initial trickle developed into an exodus.This fear of death was in part down to the Union government’s portrayal of Covid-19 as a lethal killer. Added to this was the claustrophobia created by the restrictions, which meant for many that their 24x7 stay in a tenement became psychologically and physically impossible. Suddenly, the home far away became more appealing and migrant sentiment expeditiously accelerated to mass hysteria, leading to the Long March Home.BACK TO WORKPLACES While the exodus is still on, there is now speculation about how these people will fare in due course. It’s all very well for Amitabh Kant, the CEO of NITI Aayog, to impress upon the recipient states to promote industrialisation locally, in order that the interests of the returnees are secured closer to their homes, but the reality is that industrialisation cannot happen overnight.Had the recipient states been historically more business-friendly, with in step politicians and bureaucrats, industries would have been embedded there decades ago.Neither the Union government nor the recipient states have sufficient resources to sustain the returnees for more than a few months at best. Inevitably and regrettably, it will be hunger, stress and the accompanying poor health that drives many of them back to their recent workplaces.Given human resilience, this return may be some months away. Some may never return. Others may find that their jobs no longer exist. Use of agricultural automation in harvesting wheat and maize, and shortly in transplanting paddy, by some farmers for the first time, may mean that these machines have replaced much of the labour forever.INCENTIVISE THE RETURNIt was going to happen anyway, but it took a crisis to trigger. Consequently, governments and businesses will need to be creative to accelerate the migrants’ return.The government will need to incentivise it by subsidising return travel cost, covering the cost of displacement, extending educational grants for children and promising homes fit for families.Businesses will need to offer their own financial incentives. They may need to cover lost salaries, pay in advance and offer increased pay. The cost of labour will rise and businesses will need to adapt by delivering productivity gains from up-skilling and multi-skilling, better workplace environments, better healthcare, preferably on business premises, and more clothing allowances.Businesses may also need to contract accommodation en-block from abusive landlords that earlier preyed individually on migrant families, in the process delivering better facilities and a more hospitable environment. Many businesses will proceed to build company-owned staff accommodation as they earlier did for higher-paid employees.Larger businesses will accelerate the implementation of automation, robotics and artificial intelligence (AI). Smaller businesses will follow.Housewives used to an array of domestic offerings will now experience the benefits of multi-tasking. Families will move from houses to flats to reduce their dependency on domestic helps. More cars will be owner-driven. BACK ON BETTER TERMSThe returning migrants can expect better terms, a better environment and much more respect. In time, they will save, qualify for home loans and become local residents. Shorn of the migrant tag, they will become inherently part of the community at large.This is not wishful thinking. Return migration is inevitable but the equations have changed forever.The writer is a former Congress MLA.
